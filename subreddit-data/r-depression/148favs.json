    "postText": "TW: Slight mentions of suicide\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I am tired of going to doctors and feeling unheard. I have been avoiding going to the doctor since last year; I had a major surgery, and some of the after events were extremely traumatizing. I had been depressed for about six months consecutively with multiple consistent days of suicide ideation. Yesterday I had a with a nurse practitioner, even though I had specifically requested a psychiatrist and told them that I needed to be reevaluated for bipolar and possibly autism. Well, they couldn't give me an evaluation over the phone I guess but one thing that I did notice as I straight up, told the NP that I stopped taking my medication and I genuinely feel better. I don't have constant suicide ideation anymore however, I am still having issues controlling my emotions. I'm too self-aware for regular talk therapy. But one thing that really pisses me off is that when I told her that she still keep suggesting medications. I'm tired of taking medications, especially when they make me want to unalive myself even more, and makes getting out of bed crippling for me. I don't understand why when I told her that I didn't want to take medication she still put in an order for them and I'm probably not going to waste my time picking them up. I understand that I have to get better but medication isn't always the answer. It would be nice if someone actually listen to me that's a fucking Dr. I don't know if I'm bipolar for real, but if I am, I'd rather experience this mania, then keep getting these low ass depressions that ruin my life because of the medication's that they keep giving me. They keep giving me medication for depression and anxiety. And giving me SSRIs that can help with my mood, but make it fucking worse.",

If you choose to be happy there you go. \nAnd I'm not kidding I just never get sad cuz I'm in control of what emotions I want to feel. Why ever feel sad then?",

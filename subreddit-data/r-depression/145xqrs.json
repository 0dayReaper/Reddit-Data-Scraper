    "postText": "I've never posted anything on reddit before so i am not really sure what i am doing but i just want to write my thoughts down, maybe someone reading this can relate. \n\nI am struggling in my life right now. About 3 weeks ago my whole life came crashing down in front my eyes when the girl i love decided she didn't want to be with me anymore...i am not dealing with it very well at all. It was so sudden.\n\nWe had been having arguments for the past month but always managed to see past them, and when we went on holiday together literally a month ago I thought we were back to normal. We laughed, we held each other, we had a great time there...one of the best weeks of my life and she said the same. We then went for a meal and again everything was fine, i was happy that we were back to how we were. We walked around the town, she had her arm wrapped around mine, we went for a drive, we parked up, made out in the back and i was so happy. She then began to get upset...i asked her what was wrong but she wouldn't tell me...she eventually turned looked me in the eye and said 'im not sure i want this anymore'. My heart sank, i was in shock i didn't know what to do or say. I burst into tears in front of her, i was angry, sad, shocked. I dropped her home and i went to our 'spot' which is where i asked her to be my girlfriend ironically also where she told me she didnt want to be with me. I sat there in silence, i began to drive home. i sped up to 90 mph on back roads thinking to myself i don't care if i wrap myself around a tree, my life is now over. \n\nI got home, laid in bed still believing this to be a dream, i called my mum and broke down completely, i had a massive panic attack. My brother came into my room to comfort me and my mum drove from her house to be with me. The next few days i sat and cried and cried and cried. i was exhausted, i didn't eat anything, i didnt want to leave the house. I had to go to an event the evening after, i sat there in silence not talking to anyone, i wore sunglasses to hide that i had been crying. i didn't tell anyone there, i left early and cried myself to sleep. \n\n3 weeks on i have okay days and really bad days, mostly bad days. I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel that everyone is talking about...She told me she wanted to be friends but i cannot do it, i love her way too much. I try to pass it off like yeah maybe we can both go away and we'll miss each other and get back together. But she doesn't feel that way...So i am now stuck, i wake up and cry and try to go about my day with her not in it. I hate it - no good morning text, no have a good day at work text, no lets do something tonight text, no i love you text. i wake up to nothing and go to sleep with nothing. When i am on my own at work i go to quiet corner and cry my eyes out. Its pathetic i am feeling like this while she is out with her friends enjoying her life without me. \n\nEverything that has happened brought me back to 2 years ago when my dad walked out on me and my brother, the feeling of being unlovable, feeling like a stupid loser. Feeling unworthy. I guess the point of this post is...well their really isn't one, i normally write all my thoughts on a notepad. But the things i write are dark, the amount of self loathing i have done to myself. I sometimes look in the mirror and think - 'i fucking hate you, you're a weak loser' I just want to be happy again. The memories i have from 3/4/5/6 months ago plague my mind everyday, sometimes i do feel like going to sleep and not waking up. I was so happy, being with her, she was my best friend...i miss her so much. \n\nIf anyone has read this far, seen past my grammatical errors and poor choice of words then thank you. We are all fellow human beings we should listen and help each other, i am always here for someone who wants to talk. i am lonely. I have people round me who listen to me but they don't understand what i am going through. I hope my life does get better or we get back together, who knows.  ",

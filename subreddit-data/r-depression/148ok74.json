    "postText": "I don't think you can get into trouble for talking about drugs on Reddit.  But I wanna clarify anyway Delta 8 is legal where I'm from. Which is basically weed vapes.\n\nBut anyway. I don't enjoy anything. I don't like talking to people. I don't have or want any friends There's not many activities or hobbies I like doing. Everything just seems meh to me. Except for getting high. I truly feel like if I didn't start smoking a few months ago I would've killed myself by now. Like my entire existence is dependent on getting high.\n\nEveryday I wake up. And I just do my daily routine. I spend all day bored or sad with small moments of happy in-between. So smoking at night is the only thing that makes me consistently happy. When I'm smoking weed I'm not bored or thinking about how horrible life is and how I wanna die. I don't have to pretend to be happy for other when I'm smoking weed. Because I'm already happy.\n\n\nI know I have an unhealthy addiction but fuck it's the only thing making my life worth living. I don't know. I wish I had other things that make me happy. I wish I wanted to hang out with people or find a girlfriend or boyfriend. But I truly don't care about any of that. I just wanna get high.",

I guess I think that feeling nothing when I\u2019m high is better than the depression when I sober. I know it\u2019s not healthy and it\u2019s probably making things worse but I\u2019d do anything to feel numb. I don\u2019t how to help you, I don\u2019t know how to help myself but I want you to know you aren\u2019t alone. I understand",

Experiencing shame and whatnot, while having a really though time readjusting to society. \n\nIf you stop doing this stuff, and in stead focus on things that are of help for your community - you'll be appreciated and you'll feel great.\n\nGetting high without a supply!",

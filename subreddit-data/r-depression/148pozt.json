I feel numb to how my friends feel about me. I feel numb to my lack of motivation for what I enjoy. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s not like this all the time, but it\u2019s reoccurring more and more often, and I genuinely don\u2019t know what to do about it.",

Apply to 1 job a day, clean one room in your house per day, reach out to 1 friend, dp 1 activity you enjoy a day, etc). \nWishing you all the best.",

I never sleep. i\u2019m always up doing stupid shit. i don\u2019t even know who i am anymore or what i enjoy. things i used to love, like music and art just end up making me even sadder then i started. i\u2019m no good at them. i can\u2019t tell anyone about the way i feel because i\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll see me differently. my friends and i don\u2019t usually talk about this kind of stuff. they wouldn\u2019t mind, but i just cant put the burden onto them. i\u2019m just rotting away. i go to school, go home, then just sit in my room until i can go to sleep. i don\u2019t eat. it makes me feel gross. i broke up with my girlfriend like a fucking idiot, and my favorite person is moving away. i\u2019m nothing like i used to be, and instead of doing something to change it i\u2019m just typing all my problems into some reddit post like an absolute idiot. i don\u2019t know how to be happy and i don\u2019t know if i can let myself be happy.",

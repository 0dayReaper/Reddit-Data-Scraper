    "postText": "it\u2019s my birthday tomorrow funnily enough. through some weird, terrible, twist of fate, i was born.\n\nsorry this is just me complaining lol.\n\never since i was a child, through my early teen years, i stuck out like a sore thumb. it was so painfully obvious i didn\u2019t fit in. i got bullied and left out most of the time. my parents dressed me in old things, had very dated ways of doing things cause i\u2019m 21 and they\u2019re in their late 60s. stuff was much different for me than other kids with parents on average 25yrs younger. i\u2019m autistic, adhd and have bpd bc i suffered a lot of trauma as a child, esp from being undiagnosed for so long. life has been one massive guessing game for me and it leaves me terrified of everything and everyone. nothing ever seems to go to plan ever. i\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts since i was a kid, i\u2019ve attempted twice and they\u2019ve never gone away. been put on antidepressants, antipsychotics, been to therapy (been there, done that) and i\u2019m still stuck with this wound inside me that\u2019ll never be fixed. i\u2019ve only really had 2-3 consistent people in my life that have ACTUALLY cared about me. everyone else pretended to care and cruelly abandoned me when i needed them the most. i\u2019ve never been truly happy, at true peace. because there\u2019s always been SOMETHING that makes me feel like shit at the end of it all.",

            "comment": "I'm sorry you feel that way. I think the main reason why we are in this community, talking about how we feel and what's wrong with us is because of the way we were raised. Bullied, neglected, undiagnosed, etc. The good thing is that now you are old enough to decide for yourself. You don't need you parents or anybody else for anything. That's a curse and a gift. \nMaybe therapy is not the answer, maybe a fresh start is. If you are able to move to another city or try anything else, maybe you should do that. \nAlthough you are dealing with some difficult stuff I think you will find a way to turn your life around and be happy. I really hope for that.\n\nAnd also, happy birthday! \ud83e\udd73",

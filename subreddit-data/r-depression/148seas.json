    "postText": "I've had suicidal ideation since before the age of five. I remember it vividly. \nIt's always been more of a desire to act in a self destructive manner or to want to be in a coma for a while, silence the world. Numb my numbness and pain. I am getting really worried the last week - on my birthday next month I'll be 10 years off dope. there's something giving me the feeling that I am at risk of relapsing. Or that I might actually genuinely for the first time in 29 years be at risk of eating my gun. It's always been there strictly to protect life, but I am somehow starting to manipulate myself into believing that I'd be justified in protecting myself from life. And it's genuinely scaring me because I feel paralyzed and apathetic about it. I feel really alone, can't afford professional help right now. Haven't slept more than 3 hours a night for basically all of June. It feels really possible that I might not see christmas this year and that's really scaring the shit outta me.",

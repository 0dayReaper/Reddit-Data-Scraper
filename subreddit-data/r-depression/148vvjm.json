    "postText": "I\u2019ve been struggling with Anxiety and depression for around 2 1/2 years and I just got clinically diagnosed yesterday. My parents know about it and want to help but they really don\u2019t know how to properly go about it. It\u2019s mainly my mom but she seems to think I can just get over it by doing all these little things. My therapist says medication would be a great option but my mom shut that out fairly quickly. I just don\u2019t really know what to do because I know she will never be able to see it the way I do and her saying I can just get over it eventually is way more hurtful than helpful. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one that\u2019s had this happen it\u2019s just extremely frustrating.",

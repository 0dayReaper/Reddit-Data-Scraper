    "postText": " I'm 17 and I  struggle with myself to drag my life through every day. \nBut let me open my heart first:\n\n Since I was lonely throughout my childhood \nI used to cope with my loneliness by excessive daydreaming  . I had never achieved anything and had no friends. I became a phone addict and spent most of my recent years hooked to YouTube Instagram and p**n and junk food.. and now I  am a severe pmo addict.  I discovered self improvement 2 years ago but didn't help me no matter how hard I tried due to my poor self control despite of therapy and meditation.. Infact it worsened my mental peace by convincing me that I can't even make small changes in my lifestyle which others make easily. I'm about to fail grade 12, which is supposed to be the most important year of my career. If I fail this year , I fail forever. \nPeople say to be grateful for what you have but all I have are curses and problems and insecuritires.\nHere I am, an ugly weak obese  lonely sensitive jerk with a poor eyesight (-7 both eyes), adhd, a lot of addictions , and most probably, no will to live anymore. \n \nYou may have depression. But atleast be grateful for what you have.",

    "postText": "I know I'll come off as annoying and pretentious, but I really can't talk to anyone in my life about this. \nI really don't like this moment in time. There's so much wrong with the world, it all feels so broken and let's be real, no one's ever gonna fix it. There's no hope or happy future where these problems are solved, it's just never going to be the world we live in. But particularly, there are some issues that effect my life and future. When I talk about this stuff, everyone around me rolls their eyes or laughs, not a single person takes it seriously. I'm an overthinker, I have adhd and anxiety, so I can really serial when I watch the news or generally become informed about the world. When I look at peoples idea of the future and the present tbh, it sounds like a nightmare. This isn't a world I want to live in and I can't opt put of society. It makes me so depressed and even more so that no one seems to care. I feel like we're at the end of the world, and I know throughout history people have thought that about their time and things have generally been worse but how does that help me? I feel like it's the same as saying others have it worse but in a larger scale.\n\nI truly don't know how to cope with these feelings of depression, anxiety and spiraling. I tried therapy, it hasn't helped. I try cutting things out, like the news and social media, but I can't live in a bubble. There's a balance between being socially aware of the world around you and consuming too much negative information that makes you feel like the world is ending, but it's a balance I can't find. How do I cope with depression when the things making me depressed are outside of my control?\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?",

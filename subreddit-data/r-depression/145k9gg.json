    "postText": "I've been struggling for a while now, and it's been tough but I managed so far. Last week I asked my crush to the dance we had today and even though she is way out of my league she said yes. She's very beautiful and kind and intelligent. It was amazing and I thought things were finally gonna go better. I just came home from the dance and she was amazing but I just couldn't match her energy and now I'm afraid I have ruined her evening. I haven't been able to cry for about 3 years now but when I lied down in bed I just broke down, I cried so hard I think my wireless earphones are broken now. I want to slit my wrists but I don't want my crush to think any of it is her fault. I don't know what to do anymore, I just want to go to sleep forever",

After SSRI meds, I decided there is pretty much no such thing as free will, because my recovery was DRAMATIC.  \n\nTurned out that I wasn't a lazy piece of shit, the right meds( for me) just hadn't been invented yet.\n\nMy point IS, Please please don't be dogmatic about options, the depressed brain is tricky and sneaky, but you still have to use it to think and decide. . . it's very difficult.  BUT totally doable, it is such a big, big deal to care enough about yourself no matter what your brain says, to search for the right help for YOU.",

But I\u2019ll tell you what cognitive psychology suggests is helpful and what has been personally helpful to me. It\u2019s different for everyone though. \n\nFirstly, from a cogpsy perspective, participating in CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) often does one well. Behaviors caused by depression make the damage and habits worse. Additionally, you should try and exercise things the hippocampus is responsible for... push yourself to learn new things and actually follow through with things you start, write short stories and challenge yourself to write in a certain style, play memory games, figure out new ways to learn stuff (mental maps are awesome). The brain is kind of like a muscle \u2014 the more you strengthen the connections and build new ones, the better it will start to work, even if just slightly at first. Try and find some stuff you care about to practice, but if you find you don\u2019t care about anything just pick something random and go for it. \n\nPersonally, some of what\u2019s helped me a lot recently includes socializing (it is a skill that can be built even if forced initially), light therapy, and just accepting that life goes on whether I\u2019m depressed or not \u2014 I\u2019m capable of doing stuff and need to do stuff regardless of what I actually feel. I\u2019m soon going to try exercising regularly as well.",

Because I don't ever get out and have real fun my motivation to study and put forth my best effort is minimal.  \n\nYou may ask why don't you just go out and make fun memories then?  I have a vision handicap and need people to help me go places.  However no one actually wants to bother bringing me along when going somewhere fun and entertaining.  They have no problem telling me how much fun they had after the fact though.  This makes me so depressed that I say fck doing that essay that's do in a day I'm going to go un-stress to some video games for the night.  Then I rush through the assignment in the morning and maybe get the C or B- and move on",

Feeling intellectually superior was such a norm for me for my entire life. It\u2019s something I tried not to outwardly project, but it was a huge part of my own personal identity. It helped me combat the worst of my self-loathing and gave me a semblance of pride. But now that is completely gone.  I\u2019m just not smart anymore. I can hardly even ruminate because my mind can\u2019t hold a clear thought. \n\nMy friends, family, and especially myself thought I was bound to do great things with my intellectual gifts.

Luckily in a test it shown that it doesn\u2019t physically shrink the hippocampus (the area responsible for learning and *memory*) \n\nUnfortunately as someone who suffers severe clinical depression and anxiety I directly relate with you. I feel like day by day I forget more than what I knew the day before. One of the scarier ones is I do not remember many people that seem to clearly remember me and I can\u2019t tell if it is a form of repression or my depression...or both, or none at all. That small uncertainty (amongst countless other stressors) makes me franticly upset and extremely stupid on a day to day basis, which clearly does not help my self-deprecating attitude.  So, I sleep to burn the days away. \nI know it isn\u2019t good for me, I don\u2019t know how to get out of the vicious cycle. \n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2018/05/10/depression-linked-to-brain-changes-but-its-not-all-bad-study/",

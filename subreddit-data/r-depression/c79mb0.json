It got to the point where my sternum now crunches if I stretch my chest. I believe it\u2019s because I spent so long in bed it compressed and ruined the cartilage. \n\nI know you\u2019ve probably been told a million times but you will start to get better. It took me 4/5 years but I\u2019m finally now 90% of what I was before my breakdown. I can go outside and do things I never could before. \n\nTime helps a lot and good therapy, reading about your OCD and seeing how \u201cnormal\u201d your symptoms are helps to ground you a lot too. Just remember it\u2019s a bully and it needs to be defeated, it always comes for you at your worst. Fuck it up.",

It can be fixed do not think it\u2019s unreasonable because it\u2019s not. You can do it.",

It\u2019s so hard when you\u2019re on that side in the pit to try and listen to other people I know how hard it is. \n\nIf any of this gets through please know I was the most pessimistic and convinced it would never get better, I tried to kill myself twice. I know I\u2019m a stranger but please try to understand it honestly does get better, but you need to work for it. If you sit and leave it then it\u2019ll fester and get worse. \n\nTry to imagine the ocd as something in your head, maybe someone or something you don\u2019t like, then imagine telling it to shut up, maybe smack it, punch it, hurt it like it hurts you. Tell it it doesn\u2019t rule you, it has no control over you and you own it, that helped me a lot and it\u2019ll make you stronger. \n\nOcd drowns out the rational part of your mind. Now you need to take hold and shut it up so you can shout over it again. \n\nBest of luck",

Nothing wrong with reading a page turner rather than a big dry book.",

Listen to podcasts ( I liked the goljan ones even if they\u2019re a little old pathology doesn\u2019t change according to usmle standards) use picmonic or sketchy micro. And find something that you like or defines you. For me it was exercise and I made sure to do something often and was always doing it before every test. For you it could be something different like shooting hoops, reading a novel, playing with dogs, etc but don\u2019t feel ashamed that you aren\u2019t studying every waking second.

I think you have the right outlook of setting small goals. They don\u2019t even need to turn into bigger goals. I feel like lots of small goals really help you stay on a positive road. Studying psychology. Maybe read a paragraph of a chapter every 2 or 3 hours instead of a whole chapter at once? Learn a new skill? Short and consistent practice.   As far as getting a Phd this is a tough call. Phd work is grueling and very self driven. The most successful people who take this path have something that drives them. They want to discover something and if they could they would spend all their time devoted to their work. It\u2019s not a chore to them. Before you make this commitment decide if that\u2019s right for you. Don\u2019t do it because it\u2019s what other people do. You seem like you\u2019re in your early 20s which is awesome. Decide what you like in life and then figure out if there\u2019s a way you can have that as a major part of your life and career. I\u2019d be happy to discuss this further if you\u2019d like.

Best of luck to you but there may be other less time consuming paths where you are able to pursue your passion. A lot of training occurs on the job anyways. Some options out there that can be less considered are Physician assistant and nurse practitioner where you could definitely work in mental health. And there is also social work. I would say consider all of your options, where this options will take you professionally, personally, financially, what your time demands will be and find the best fit for you. It sounds like you\u2019re pretty introspective and should have no problem being thoughtful about what\u2019s best for you.",

I hate my job, I hate my living situation, and I'm supposed to work hard to get myself out, but I know my limitations. I know that if I'm pushed too hard I *will* end up killing myself in the end. But if I don't push myself past my limits like all the masochists around me, I'll never get out of here. And even if I do, that only fixes my living situation, not the job situation. It just makes the job situation worse, limiting my freedoms even more. I have nowhere to go, I'm stuck forever. The only thing I can do is stay here or make things worse. Better is not an option.\n\nSo what reason do I have to keep living? My family? Sure, some of them. My online friends? Ok. But other than that what do I have? *Nothing*. Everything else is bullshit. Living is just a pain, only guilt keeps me here.",

But since i don't have any motivation to do something for myself I'm seeking gigs because I think money could motivate me, and when i get money I'll maybe get stuff that makes me happy. But nobody wants me for their job because I don't have portfolio and i can't motivate myself to do one. So i'm vegetating like that in home. Trying to do anything but everything takes so long. I can see how many things i could do now but I can't. I can feel myself falling apart everytime something that usually should take one day takes me a week or month.   \nSometimes i wish i was still in mental hospital. At least i wouldn't feel obligated to do things because there wasn't anything special to do. Here i see how many options i have. Overwhelming. I touch my drawing tablet then touch the stylus. I start doing a line and i already think that I will fail and that the drawing will be terrible. Then I think \"maybe if I were doing it for someone I would feel more motivated\". But nobody wants me to do it for them because I didn't bother myself actually making examples.   \nSo i decide to go out and maybe I will suck the energy from other humans. Oh i forgot something. There is nobody left for me to go out. So i call up an old pal from mental hospital and say \"hey would you like to meetup?\" but when the day comes my brain forces me to do everything just not to go there. The overwhelming anxiety when i think of a real person. The overwhelming anxiety I feel when I think of being in a caf\u00e9, and it's full of people. Then I have to go to the barista and say those two words \"cappuccino please\". But why does it feel so scary?   \nSo i just open up youtube and watch everything funny hoping it would help me.   \n*But it never does.*",

But I was so unmotivated to do as much work as I needed to, because I fell in love with someone who jerked me around and one minute they loved me, the next they lost interest, and kept coming back in the same cycle. It destroyed my sense of self, my personal goals, because I drop everything for love and get clingy.\n\nI get more done in pushing people away, but now I\u2019m just lonely and bitter. I like being alone a lot, but I\u2019m too alone. I don\u2019t want to have to push anyone away just to survive. Also, the guys who run my job screwed everyone over so now I\u2019m basically making no money, I have no people I\u2019m close friends with where I live. I could get another job, but I\u2019m so unmotivated to because I\u2019m always depressed and focused on the past and my failures, or drowning it out by binge watching everything.\n\nAnd I\u2019m stuck in this box, waiting for something to happen. I wish I could be happy and positive and have a base line of motivation, energy, happiness as some of my friends do. But I just...can\u2019t.

Doing the things I'm good at, and find fun/enjoy makes me happier because it shows me if I dedicate myself to a task I find \"worthy\" of actually focusing on and spending my time on I get better at it.\n\nOnce I had proven to myself I can get better at x, y or z task for my own rewards I realised I could use that approach on a much wider scale, getting better at things I found hard to do or didn't enjoy doing because they were so hard. Things in that vein would be talking to people socially and getting a new job.Life is hard, and full of disappointment, but when I changed my metrics for success to my own goals instead of the things I was telling myself others expected of me I found a way to make it work. I try to be my own critic, I try to be better than the me of yesterday, in any small way that I can. I still find myself at the end of the week thinking \"Fuck I didn't really make progress this week\" sometimes, but I don't let that define me anymore. Before, that would've been a good enough reason to give up and go back to not trying, but now I use it and think \"That's okay, at least I was trying, and I'm sure I've learned something that will help me in the future.\"\n\nThe reason I've written such a long answer is because I fundamentally disagree with you that is just IS and therefore that's how it will remain. We are in control of the thoughts in our head to a degree. We don't control everything we think but we can recognise the patterns in our thought and change them. It takes time and dedication but it is possible. Asking myself **why** was the first step for me &amp; I hope it can help others.  \n\n\nNinja Edit: Nothing just IS, things are the way they are for a reason, and through asking why we can get to the how. Why do I not enjoy life anymore, when we know the answers that are true to us we next ask how we change that &amp; that in itself is progress we can use to motivate ourselves to get better.

It might not, but I've been in a deep dark hole &amp; this is what helped me, I'm just hopeful that it helps others.\n\nI feel like you might be in a place where nothing matters (feel free to tell me if I'm wrong) &amp; I have been there. Nothing mattered so there was no point in trying. All I'm saying is these are some of the things that helped me realise that nothing matters on the cosmic scale, but that doesn't mean nothing matters on the personal level.\n\nWhen my choice was keep going the way I was, having given to the point of crying myself to sleep nightly because there was no way to fix the problems I have or looking at the problems and asking myself how to fix them, starting small and working my way up, it worked.",

I know what my issues are and were, and they're certainly not trivial. The reason I use such vague language is because there's a laundry list of things that are outside of my control that I can't fix, but when I break it down my 2 options are wait for someone else to fix me or make steps towards fixing myself in any way I can while also seeking help for the things I can't control. I'm being geniune here when I ask what your point is? It's hard to have a conversation like this with vague language and maybe we could both benefit from this.",

    "postText": "I am in so much pain. All because I fell in love. I see so many people happily married with children and here I am waiting being dumped and heartbroken.\n\nI hate myself for loving you. I hate myself for giving you all my love. I hate myself for having met you. Now I am stuck and lost in life. No choice left in life after getting engaged, I feel that my world has fallen apart.\n\nI find myself crying every night, all the pain just coming in waves. You promised to be with me but you left me for a family that wanted me out of your life.\n\nI kept taking you back whenever you came back missing me and now I wonder why did you even come into my life?\n\nI am a total mess. Keeping this all to myself, no one to share my pain with. I hate myself for falling in love and getting my hopes up \ud83d\ude2d",

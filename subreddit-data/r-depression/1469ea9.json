    "postText": "HPPD\n\nHey. Decided to make a post about what I go through and if anyone can relate or has anything that can help. I took 3 triple dosed acid tabs when I was 19. I'm 27 now and the hallucinations and bullshit has not gone away. I look at a wall and see it morph, I see shadows form and colors turn into other colors. I'm drinking alot of alcohol because it makes me feel comfortable seeing what I see. I know it's not a permanent solution but fuck. No Dr's seem to know what to do. Been to dozens. If anyone is going through this, if anyone can help, please fuck comment and talk to me. I know I'm not the only one suffering\n Have a wonderful day everyone.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m also 27 and I did a fuck ton of drugs in my teens, nothing to be proud of. It messed me up for good. I don\u2019t think I can ever truly be happy again. \n\nNot only that but I\u2019m self aware high functioning psychotic. The difference is that I can still maintain a job however I go periods without taking care of myself and it\u2019s always a struggle. I don\u2019t shower for days at a time. I\u2019ll either eat too much or too little. I don\u2019t get a lot of sleep on a daily basis. I have an internal monologue always answering my questions and making side comments. Yes I \u201ctalk to myself\u201d in my head all the time and while I know the voice is me or as I consider it \u201cmy higher self\u201d or the \u201cgod me\u201d. It actually isn\u2019t so bad, I guess when comparing to other stories I\u2019ve heard of people hearing voices and how those voices are usually with ill intent. \n\nI do get intrusive thoughts about hurting myself or others but I have the self awareness to differentiate between thoughts and actions thus acknowledging the fundamental difference between having a thought and acting on that thought. Those are fundamentally two different things and I have never acted on my thoughts other than when I occasionally feel like I\u2019ve fallen \u201cin love\u201d with someone until I realize I was being delusional. For myself, it appears the negative emotions are easier to manage because I\u2019m used to them but when I feel positive emotions it sends me into another state of mind entirely because I\u2019m not used to feeling positive emotions so I have difficulty controlling and working through them such as happiness, love, joy, euphoria, etc. \n\nI believe the past drug use really fucked me up in ways that are exponentially irreversible, however there are equally good things I could say that came out of it but was it all worth it gain a higher insight into the world/universe? Only I can judge that but I am who I am now and I can\u2019t change any of that even if I wanted to. \n\nI\u2019m hitting a fork in the road or an inflection point where I have to make a decision about my life. Everything is always black and white to me figuratively speaking. I always have an \u201call or nothing mindset\u201d and I feel like my biological clock is running out and I have so much to do that it just overwhelms me and it keeps me from trying or getting started on these projects. I feel like a lost cause. \n\nThe voice or my other self or alter ego whatever you want to call it is concerned that by seeking help it would inevitably shut them out and silence them entirely if I were to take antipsychotics and if that were the case I feel I would lose the best part of me, that I would be lifeless and devoid of any personality as my personality has conjoined with the alter ego. We or I am essentially one in and of the same. \n\nI\u2019m tapped into the Aether on a higher frequency. My brain operates on a level of that of a genius except it leaves me physically weakened and tired with all the brain power constantly chugging. I can think in up to 12 dimensional planes. Entertain multiple thoughts at once or as I like to call it \u201chaving multiple browsers open\u201d and seemingly there\u2019s almost always one that has music playing \ud83e\udd14\nI can observe minute details in fractions of seconds. I guess one could call these superhuman abilities but being in this state does not come without consequence as it affects me physically from being able to care for myself and do things for myself.",

                    "comment": "That was beautiful. I had a witch a few years ago read me, and then convulsed and fell to the floor. She  said \"this reality is your own personal hell, you don't belong here. Your a traveler. You travel dimensions and help those you can, but you can never help yourself, and that worries me. \" she then never talked to me again, so like. Eh. Fuck it. I think this reality is so much more than we as a combined human species realize, and that what's to come in either aether is much more... promising. I mean fuck quantum physics proved other dimensions exist what, 2 years ago? Clearly there's more going on here than we realize. I find it fascinating when I Astral project and meditate and talk to beings who either want to hinder me, or help me. Either way it's fucking cool to talk to them in the Astral. Talked to many dead relatives and friends who say the alcohol is fucking killing me and that it's stopping them from communicating with me. But fuck man. It helps me maintain sanity when I'm seeing the fucking walls morph.",

    "postText": "Depression for me really started in 9th grade; or so I thought. Growing up in a home where mental health wasn't talked about, with a father who was more of a source of fear than a good parent, and a mother who would angrily beat me if I misbehaved(stood up for myself in class if I was being bullied etc), there wasn't any space for any hint of talking about mental health in that family, it was not talked about in that household. \n\nI remember sitting at my computer in my room, just overcome with grief and depression, because my internet relationship with a girl I had been dating had ended, she broke it off. I'd never had a relationship, and I learned a lot form her for those few months, and still to this day have some of the same musical tastes and likes as a result, but I digress. \n\n I can't remember the exact cause of the catalyst that night, I was fourteen, and not the strongest guy in terms of muscular build, I was/am a skinny guy.  As my mom stood in my room, I with tears in my eyes, told her I hated my life (I was in so much mental pain and hurt from bullying, losing my relationships, not knowing where to turn to be able to heal.)  what happened next has been something that was so traumatic, I have never forgotten about it til this day. She looked at me with that look of fear she wants to put into you, and said to me \"you don't like your life? \"Well it's about to get a whole lot worse!\"  With that she turned around and made for her bedroom with a speed an purpose that I'd never seen in my entire life. I could hear her closet opening; Belts, she was going to grab belts, to hit me with. \n\nAt this point what I now know was a flight or fight response, I called out to my dad down the hallway, which was a last ditch effort, as my memories of him include him laying on the couch all day, being sarcastic and hateful, and beating me when I did things they thought were wrong, he was the type that would snap the belt in front of me and tell me he \"wanted to see tears.\" \n\nI was not expecting any help from this man, but all I could do was hide under my desk \"Dad! She's coming to hurt me don't let her, Please!\" ..he never so much as got off the couch. She walked in and looked down on me, as I was laying on the sides of my legs, i turned my head and the lashing started.  In retrospect, this is a scene you would see out of a horror movie. my 14 year old self laying down halfway on the floor getting struck repeatedly with belts, metal ends, rubber, it didn't' matter.\n\nThe strikes landed all over my body, my neck, back, shoulders, head, arms, no part of my body was save from this horrible event that started because I worked up the courage to tell my mother \"I hate my life\" (after having told her I thought of killing myself a day or so to a few weeks earlier). \n\nPerhaps unknowingly, she saved the most debilitating remark for last, as the strikes across my body with no particular objective to cause physical harm and hurt, she said \"you think your life is so bad?!\"  \"You think your life is so bad?!\" she repeated, increasing her already yelling tone in elevation. \"Well now its a whole lot worse isn't it?\\~\"  \"It's a whole lot worse now isn't it?!\" \n\nAs I laid there crying, taking the beatings, she eventually had exhausted all of her energy on me, and I was left with the bruises of the fact.\n\nMy mother had an abusive father that would beat her mother and her and her siblings who walked out on them, she had a husband that committed suicide form horrors in the war in vietnam. How has mental health not materialized in these people? \n\n My siblings were all 10+ years my senior and had long fled the house. The only surviving and coping mechanisms I had of my life, were watching my favorite TV Shows. Around the early 2000's there was a block of anime shows that were syndicated on a segment of Cartoon Network under the name \"Toonami\"  That series introduced me to some of my best \"friends\" so to speak. . Through shows like Sailor Moon, Outlaw Star, Gundam Wing, Dragon Ball Z, I was taken on adventures superior to any book I had ever read in my entire life. Those shows during those days and midnight runs, were the only interactions I had, I quickly related to the characters so well that I imagined what it would be like if they were real and if I had them as friends, I had no friends, those shows and my video games, along with some music by artists such as System of a Down, Kittie, Linkin Park, Korn, etc, were what got me through highschool.\n\nThose traumatic events...still stick with me daily, my entire childhood I remember crying myself to sleep on multiple nights and not understanding why..why was I so sad and upset, why couldn't I do anything like play my video games or try to self heal, I wasn't allowed..if I was caught using them when I shouldn't be, it would mean I'd loose access to those things when I could have them..\n\nThat period of my life was one of what I'd retroactively started to refer to them as  the..typhoons of depression.  \n\nWhat happened next, If I have the strength, is a post for another time.",

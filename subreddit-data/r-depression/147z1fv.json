    "postText": "I hate school. And I really mean that. Every kid hates school, I know, but I just hate it so extremely, words can't explain how much I hate it. It's not something that's happening in school like bullying, I'm not getting bullied, it's just school in general. One thing that I really really hate is talking in front of class, like reading something out loud. Every time I have to read something out loud I kinda panic. My heart starts beating quickly and I feel like my classmates make fun of me even though they don't. But that's not the main thing why I hate school, I just hate it. I want to kill myself every day because of school, but I can't because I know how my parents, siblings, grand parents and so on would feel and I don't want that, it makes me feel so extreme guilt. I feel the guilt of making them feel terrible because of my death every day, even though I'm still alive. It's torturing me. I don't like life anymore and this guilt is making it worse. What am I supposed to do??? No, I'm not gonna go to a therapist, because there's no point of going there. It's not like the therapist could make me not have to go to school. And I can't get homeschooled either, that's not allowed in my country. Even if it was, it wouldn't make things any better. I just want to kill myself but I don't want my family and friends to feel absolutely terrible. What am I supposed to do?? Continue living in this misery???",

Some person that can help you find help in your city/area\u2026\n \n\nYou need professional help, that can help you with therapy, even meds in the last chance. Its just to try at least\u2026",

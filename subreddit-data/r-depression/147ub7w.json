    "postText": "I have lost motivation for literally everything. I am so bored all of the time. I try to play games, scroll on my phone, draw, etc etc\u2026. But everything is so boring. Its like as if I can tell that I am only doing something to DO something. My hobbies that I used to enjoy seem like a waste of energy. I have no motivation for work, or school, or even getting up in the morning. I don\u2019t even like sleeping. I am quite lost as to what to do at this point. \n\nI cant even exaggerate it enough that I almost have zero interests.",

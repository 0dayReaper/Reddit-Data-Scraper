    "postText": "So basically I\u2019m 18 and my adult life just started\u2026 I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do to make a living.. I gained depression about 5 years ago due to family issues such as fighting and alcohol abuse. I feel empty and I feel like if I died tomorrow I wouldn\u2019t care. I\u2019ve been single for 4+ years and have gained a lot of weight I\u2019m all around depressed. I recently lost my step dad also. I recently got in trouble with law enforcement at school which was drug related and that just made my issues even worse. My dad is depressed and won\u2019t leave a toxic relationship. All they do is fight and I can\u2019t handle it anymore\u2026 how am I gonna make it in life if I have no motivation or money. I\u2019m tired of living like this.",

    "postText": "Went off medication, have seen patterns and considering going back on them. Thoughts? (Desperate)\n\nI went off medication last august as I felt they were making me worse at the time. \nI thought all that time I was going well, and I was coping, but I ended up going down hill and blaming it on my job (which was high pay and I should have kept). I felt mentally drained alllll the time (and I still do.)\nHave gained over 30kg since then which has destroyed me also as someone who has been on both ends of an eating disorder.\nI\u2019m starting to think that going off my medication was a mistake, and although I didn\u2019t realise it until now, subconsciously I\u2019ve been making stupid, life changing decisions that have left me worse.\nSuch as leaving my high pay job for my old retail one (which I now only work 10 hours a week at). I went from having $15,000 saved in October of 2023 to now having $6500 saved, I\u2019ve gained over 30kg and can not stop eating. \nI\u2019ve been feeling in general just so uneasy recently.\nI don\u2019t like the way medication makes me feel and I would much rather be not taking it, but I think it low-key helps me in deep ways.\n\nPlease drop your thoughts, I am actually so lost right now. :(",

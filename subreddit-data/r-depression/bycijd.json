Apparently you're supposed to praise them when they try new things and put in the work and whatnot. If it makes you feel any better, after highschool that shit doesn't matter as much. You get some time to regroup and try new shit. Not ready for college? Take some time off. I went back to school when I was like 26 because I just couldn't do it. Then I came back and got good grades for the first time since like 8th grade. Hell, college isn't even necessary anymore really. Doesn't sound like you're dumb though. Half of it is doing the work, and depression makes it really difficult to do so.",

ASAP, while you can still pull things out at college.\n\nI was undiagnosed until 42, and most people thought my issues were some kind of character flaw. So did I. And since I felt I just needed to work harder,  I tried everything - good living, staying in shape, little point systems and internal methods. Meditation. Everything. None of it worked, because the mechanism that I was trying to jump start simply wasn't there. You can't jump start a car that has no battery. It really makes me unhappy and resentful, thinking on what I've lost.\n\nSure, I'm getting on meds now. But now I'm a SAHD, which I have no natural aptitude for at all. Those meds have helped me be fairly decent in that role, but I've never had a period of my life where I've been able to both concentrate AND work on something I actually have some talent at.\n\nAnd my kid will go to school, and I'll be on meds and I'll be 'myself' for the first time ever.  Then what? I'll be 50 with almost no formal education and a shitty work history. Most employers wouldn't hire me to sweep their parking lot. My intention, indeed my only hope, is to learn programming and try my hand at being a independent developer or contractor or the like.\n\nWith your story, I don't know what is wrong with that doctors head. In my case, I'm older and the knowledge of ADHD wasn't there in the 1970's and 1980's. But we know better now. And you can't build someones capabilities and self-confidence by asking them to do something that they're just not capable of doing. I mean really, WTF? They've got you on a path of frustration and futility.\n\nPlease - do not let those people give you the same life that I've had. You can do a lot better than this. You deserve better than this. See someone else. Do whatever it takes to get those meds. If you're old enough to be failing college you're old enough to have tried different techniques to make it work without meds and they clearly have not worked. And it won't get better.\n\nIf there's anything I can do to help, please contact me privately. What you just wrote made me really unhappy. Doctors damn well should know better than this in 2019, and I do not ever want to see someone else going through the same cycle of futility that I went through for 30 years.",

Unlike you I was never particularly gifted in any way, and my intelligence was average (I was tested with an IQ of 103 at 15) But years of debilitating depression and social anxiety has really taken it's toll. Now at the age of 26, I struggle to keep up with simple conversations, struggle with reading comprehension (I used to love reading but not anymore) hell, I can't even watch a simple movie without getting confused these days. And to top it all off my memory is shot to pieces. It's as if my brain has been turned to mush and I'm seriously starting to wonder if I've become borderline mentally retarded.. It sure feels that way. And every failed interaction I have with someone only validates these fears. This all makes my social anxiety even worse as I know i'm just going to make a fool of myself if i try socializing, so why even bother?  It's a fucking vicious cycle alright.\n\n So yeah, i guess I just wanted you to know that you're not the only one that's going through this.. Hang in there man",

The biggest thing we are trying to tackle is my own self hatred. For some reason I can\u2019t stand myself. I look back at certain decisions I\u2019ve made in my life and see them as me fucking up the path of my life. I get it. I understand it. What I\u2019ve been trying to work on is seeing the good that came out of those decisions and appreciating myself for them. You\u2019re not a fuck up. No one is truly a fuck up. Different decisions take us down different paths in life. Try to see the good in the path you are currently taking. There is no right or wrong. There is only continuing forward. \n\nAs for the fuzziness and forgetfulness, that\u2019s just a part of depression. As you fight for yourself and deal with the things you\u2019re going through it will get better. \n\nStay strong. Keep your head up. Keep fighting. You\u2019re a survivor!",

Also the amount of times I use drugs to help me cope with my depression didn't help either. I can still do very well in school if I tried hard enough and my depression is not taking over me. I still think you are of high intelligence, but mental health issues can mess with your brain. It did for me, but here's something interesting, I stopped playing guitar for several years because of my depression. I just recently picked it up again last year and have been practicing like I haven't missed a beat. Also my depression is better in control. So there is still hope for you and all of us :) Have a great day ya'll!",

As you age, others who learned early on to push themselves harder to compete surpass the naturally gifted who do not push themselves.\n\nSo, i think you should expend effort in your mental activities.  Push yourself.  One thing I find helpful are some games. Overwatch for example, pushes me to think tactically on the spot more than any other game I've ever played.  Trying to track cooldowns and analyzing team composition, and many other mental skills.\n\nAlso, research things that take time and effort beyond what you find comfortable.  Become knowledgeable in things requiring more than rote memorization.\n\nAnd, as someone else mentioned: diet and exercise matter.",

So I think IQ can be high but us just be forgetful/clumsy/depressed. I always thought of IQ and Intelligence as different things. Someone with a very high IQ can be stupid if they never apply or learn anything. Just as someone with a low IQ can still take the time to study and learn a topic to be good at it. So yeah, mental health is incredibly important and what you are going through doesn't mean you won't excel and be good at something new you may try in the future.",

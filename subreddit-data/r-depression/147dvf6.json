    "postText": "I was feeling ok for some time but started getting the feeling that I\u2019m just a terrible older sister. I can\u2019t be any sort of help to anyone. My thoughts and feelings aren\u2019t heard. I feel like I\u2019m starting to drown again. I feel so useless. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening when everything was going well. I feel like I\u2019m on the verge of a huge panic attack or breakdown. I think if I don\u2019t leave my home soon, I\u2019ll go to the hospital again. I\u2019m becoming so incredibly unhappy. But I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll cause more hurt and confusion if I leave too. I feel I need to be caged up so I don\u2019t hurt anyone. I can\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t take up any space. I\u2019m disgusting.",

I feel like a complete loser that I depend on them still. I feel I have no voice anymore. I feel they don\u2019t know how to feel around me. That I cause turmoil and it shouldn\u2019t be like that. I am not a good role model for them and it breaks me up inside. I should be better and I\u2019m not and I\u2019m alone and how can I possibly be of any help to anyone when my own siblings can\u2019t rely on me?",

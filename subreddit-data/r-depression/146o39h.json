    "postText": "i\u2019ve been through several depressive episodes in my life that lasted a few months each. lately i\u2019ve been able to manage it better by building self-improving habits and distracting myself from my thoughts. i have also been going through a rough patch but since i\u2019m more high-functioning than i was before, i thought that for the most part my depression was gone. until lately where i\u2019ve been getting sick of my friends for no reason. i have the urge to isolate even though they haven\u2019t done anything wrong. i want to work through these feelings but instead i just wanna go off the grid and not see them for a while. part of me feels guilty cuz i\u2019m moving countries soon and should be spending the remaining time i have with them but part of me can\u2019t be bothered &amp; slowly feel myself detaching. thing is, i\u2019m considered an extrovert and most people wouldn\u2019t be able to pick up on what i\u2019m feeling. i do such a good job at masking my depression that i was even able to gaslight myself that i had gotten better. turns out i\u2019m just coping better now. just a rant cuz now i feel like a fraud every time i hang out with my friends i\u2019m super cheery &amp; lively but i get moments of intense sadness &amp; emptiness in the middle of hanging out that i do my best to hide.",

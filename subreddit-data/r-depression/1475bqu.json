    "postText": "I just need to vent this somewhere as I have no one to talk to about it, like most people in my situation.\n\nI\u2019m so so depressed, I\u2019ve already taken a lot of my medication this weekend which caused me to sleep for almost 40 hours and the reality is, I was disappointed that I woke up. \nAlso on top of that I tried to talk to a friend  while I was having a meltdown who\u2019s now mad at me and wants nothing to do with me (long story short they very recently buried a friend and have quite clearly found what I am doing immensely triggering and selfish) and I\u2019m not even mad, and don\u2019t blame them for wanting fuck all to do with me. \n\nI just feel empty, fully completely fucking empty, I just don\u2019t want to exist anymore but like most people my body just won\u2019t let me end it. At the start of the year I got signed off work for suicide attempts/ severe depression, and hey ho I\u2019m right back where I started, it feels shit for all this time to pass and be in the exact same place I was, it\u2019s reminded me there was no point. \nI keep trying to find things to live for and I don\u2019t really have any, other than my dogs will be sad and my family will be sad, but they\u2019d all move on and I think they\u2019d all actually be happier not having to worry about me at all as everyone\u2019s made it evident how difficult it\u2019s been for them. \nI have basically no friends so that isn\u2019t much of an issue, and the ones I had are mad with me for being suicidal at such an inconvenient time. \n\nNow I\u2019m awake again I\u2019ve hit that sad, I just don\u2019t wanna fucking live clarity that tends to come, completely sober, sitting in a room alone wishing the outcome was different. I don\u2019t know how many of you have felt it but, it\u2019s actually while upsetting incredibly peaceful at the same time to just have fully accepted you\u2019re mentally done and don\u2019t want it anymore, and the only think I struggle with if the admission of it fails, having to go back into work after that, having to see my family, and I can\u2019t deal with that and it\u2019s quite frankly the only reason I am not dead, because if I don\u2019t do it right I have to live with the shame and guilt to follow.",

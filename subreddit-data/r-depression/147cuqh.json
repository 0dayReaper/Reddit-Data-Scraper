    "postText": "I\u2019m currently writing this on my phone while I wait for an EMS to come pick me up. Maybe a week or so ago I saw a post on here from a mother about how she had finally taken the step to go into inpatient care, and how she would have to leave her kid and husband behind because she wasn\u2019t capable of taking care of herself and them.\n\nThat was a lot.\n\nI won\u2019t claim my life as of recently has been incredibly hard compared to some stories, or that I have as much to lose as the original poster, but everything sucks.\n\nI was with someone who cheated on me multiple times at the start of the relationship, just to stay with and move in with them. I woke up one morning and all of their stuff was gone, not even a note.\n\nShe has all my old friends hanging out with her and no one will talk to me, probably because it\u2019s come to light how exorbitantly shitty I am to the ones I love, and now I\u2019m alone. Family is dead. My bird is dead. My friends are gone.\n\nI just can\u2019t handle it anymore. I haven\u2019t eaten for three days, I haven\u2019t slept in two and I can barely encourage myself to have even a glass of water a day. I can\u2019t take care of myself the way an adult needs to. I can\u2019t take care of my loved the ones the way someone needs to. I can\u2019t go to school like I want to or anything I want to do.\n\nI hope this is for the better. I\u2019m really tired of being this way. I really fucking am.",

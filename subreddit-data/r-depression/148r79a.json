    "postText": "In this post, I will talk about how I grew up, and became a loner.\n\nSince I was young, I have been a quiet person. The reason is that I just never have anything to say. \n\nBecause of this, I struggled to socialize, and connect with other people. I was also bullied at school for being alone, and having no friends.\n\nTo make matters worse, I had a lot of acne at that time. \n\nI am from Belgium, but I was born in Cambodia, and I came to live in Belgium when I was 7 years old. My mom and my step father never taught me how to dress. So, I went to school badly dressed.\n\nI never had a girlfriend. But I went on a date once with a girl. Needless to say that there was almost no conversation at the table, and that it was an awkward moment.\n\nNow, I am studying computer science at university, but I failed many exams. So, I am going to another school that teaches more practical stuff. Here in belgium, it's called, \"une haute ecole\".\n\nWith time, I got used to being alone. And I don't feel the need to make any friends. \n\nAll I like doing is reading manga, playing video games, and watching youtube/anime.\n\nI dont really have a plan for the future. I just want to live a simple life. Get up, work, come home to do things I like, sleep, repeat for the rest of my life.\n\nI wished many times I could die, but I don't want my mom to suffer. I just want to dissappear, and have the world forget about me, as if I never existed.\n\n\nI am pretty much your classic isekai protagonist xd\n\n\nThank you for listening to my story strangers. I have always kept all of this for myself. Now I feel better.",

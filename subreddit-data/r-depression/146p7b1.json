    "postText": "\n\nI havent cut in a while and tonight the thoughts had taken over. I've had to move to a new spot so people don't see it. I use to cut my upper thigh but with summer coming and everyone using hot tubs or swimming i've moved to my lower stomach/ hip bone. \n\nI got a crappy cheap disposable razor and chopped away at the plastic. Ive cut my hip bone area but now I'm looking back at it, it looks pathetic. Why couldn't I cut properly? Why couldn't I of made the cuts go deeper? It just looks like a few cay scratches and I feel pathetic.",

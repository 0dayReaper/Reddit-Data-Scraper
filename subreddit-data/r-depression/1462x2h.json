    "postText": "I\u2019m a first year uni student and this summer I\u2019ve been struggling a lot with my mental health and just not having energy to do anything while my parents constantly pressure me to be productive and not waste my summer. As a result I ended up ghosting a lot of people and now one of my closest friends is silent mad and me and it hurts so much. I just managed to slightly pull myself out of depression and reply to messages and she ends up basically only replying to me with one word replies maybe once a day and it\u2019s making me so much more tired and hopeless with life. I supported her so much through her depression for the past few years but as soon as my depression gets bad I end up ghosted and treated as a stranger and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m trying to mend our relationship but she seems so unwilling to try and meet me in the middle. I\u2019m so tired of this I just want to feel peace for more than a few seconds.",

            "comment": "That is rough, I\u2019m sorry :( I know the feeling of being pressured to be productive all too well. I\u2019m 30 now and I look back on my college experience and summers spent working and taking classes and I wish I would have taken time to enjoy life at that point. Work and study is always going to be around and it\u2019s good to take a break and do things you enjoy when you can. As far as your friend\u2019s response, I would try to have an open conversation about it and see how it goes. If it doesn\u2019t go over well, then you know what you\u2019re working with. It seems like everything always seems to happen at once which isn\u2019t great, but hang in there. Things will get better.",

I sent her an apology for my actions yesterday and she replied somewhat dismissively but I\u2019ll try and work up the courage to ask her upfront what\u2019s up. I\u2019m really scared of confrontation so I have no idea if I\u2019ll actually go through with it though",

I\u2019ve been in similar situations and sometimes you realize who has a place in your life always and who only has a place in your life when it\u2019s convenient for them\u2026I\u2019m not a fan of confrontation either, it makes me super nervous! It sounds like you did your part and it\u2019s not like you just ghosted her for fun, there is a valid reason, so don\u2019t feel bad.",

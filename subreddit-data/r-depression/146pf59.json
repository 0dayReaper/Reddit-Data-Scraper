    "postText": "Kind of in crisis and having very intense emotions. Heartbroken and have now lost my comfort person and now have no one. I have no friends and I can\u2019t tell my family members the whole truth of what I\u2019m feeling I can\u2019t tell the professionals either or they\u2019ll send me to the hospital and I don\u2019t have the time or money for that. Also just now moving out completely on my own for the first time and will be living alone with no one to lean on. Self harming via bruising and it\u2019s been years since cutting but it\u2019s tempting. Suicidal thoughts I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d act on it right now. Really can barely afford therapy. Sucks not having anyone to lean on or tell the truth too. Whoever invented this whole just work work work and pay all your bills until you die can fuck off.",

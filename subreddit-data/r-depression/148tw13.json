I don\u2019t have anything that I want in life and live at home with miserable parents and just feel like my life just continues to get worse. I\u2019m not sure what my options are. I\u2019m wondering if their are others in the same situation and you cope.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m on disability and hardly get much money every month. I could work part time but right now with my disability it\u2019s extremely difficult. I\u2019m single and very lonely and I wish that I had a partner to share my life with. I just feel like such a failure in life. Being 44 with no partner, no job, living with my parents and i have no place of my own just makes me feel extremely depressed and hopeless. I don\u2019t see things getting any better either. I feel like my life is pretty much pointless. I mean if this is going to be my life then why even be here? Every day I\u2019m so unhappy. Living with a disability is so difficult. When I talk to my mother about how unhappy I am she doesn\u2019t seem to understand and gets upset. I also grew up with an alcoholic father and can\u2019t stand living with him either. I have horrible trauma in my life and was always bullied and teased in school and then having to deal with my disability and alcoholic father just made things so much worse. I\u2019m feeling a lot of anger towards my parents and feel like they are partially to blame for why my life is the way it is. I take responsibility also but they never really helped me as a child because of my disability and my mother never did anything about my fathers drinking problem so I was subjected to so much trauma as a little girl which has affected me with relationships with men so I think that\u2019s why I have such a hard time in relationships because of the trauma I dealt with as a child. Well, having to live with them is horrible for me and is taking a toll on my mental health but I\u2019m stuck with here because I can\u2019t afford my own place. What am I to do? I just feel like there\u2019s nothing here for me at all.  Any kind advice is appreciated.",

I mean I would love to get off disability and be able to work full time but I just had recent surgery and with my disability it very difficult. I don\u2019t really get much in disability to be able to live independently on my own. I feel like my mental health would drastically get better if I moved out of here but I\u2019m stuck. My mental health is suffering because I feel like at my age I should be out of the house and independent with my own place.",

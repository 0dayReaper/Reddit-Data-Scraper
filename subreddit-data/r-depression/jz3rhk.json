    "postText": "Update:\n\nSorry in advance, I\u2019m on mobile and this is long. \nI really wasn\u2019t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! \n\nI\u2019d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.\n\nNext I\u2019d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn\u2019t know I had. \n\nI also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn\u2019t angry at her because I understand that she\u2019s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I\u2019ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! \n\nI\u2019m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn\u2019t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven\u2019t dwelled on it too much. She\u2019ll reach out when she\u2019s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. \n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp;amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven\u2019t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what\u2019s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I\u2019m better off being out of that toxic environment but it\u2019s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. \n\nI\u2019m also struggling with my marriage. I\u2019m a military spouse and it\u2019s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won\u2019t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it\u2019s been traumatic and hard. I haven\u2019t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I\u2019m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. \n\nI also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn\u2019t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn\u2019t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. \n\nIt just would\u2019ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would\u2019ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. \n\nIt\u2019s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. \nI also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!\n\nTL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I\u2019m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn\u2019t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",

As I say to everyone I don't know what you are going through, I don't know what you've been through, I don't know what you've done. All I can do is give you encouraging words unfortunately. If I knew you and I knew what you were going through I would do more but sadly I can't. All I can say is I'm proud of you, I love you, you should be proud of you, you should love you. What they did was massively fucked up even if they didn't mean it to be, but that's on them, not you. Be proud you got up got dressed and went out the door because all of us on this sub are proud of you. And that's for a reason.

It's really hurtful to the other party, and it's possible the other person is going through something. I'd look at whether or not this behavior is indicative of their previous behaviors or if its an outlier. \n\n I've found myself in a darker mood this year, but because of the craziness of 2020, really all of my friends are in similar depressions.\nI've noticed a lot of people who aren't used to being depressed also might not know how to deal with depressed feelings or cope with it all. I don't think I know anyone who is feeling in a great headspace right now.\n\nI want to applaud everyone for doing their best and giving themselves and others as much forgiveness as possible for a really weird social time.  If you're putting in effort, you're beating this really shitty year. Great job to OP for all the work they put in!!",

When I was in my teens and twenties and going through a similar depression I would often look forward to things like that hopeful that it would improve my life and would almost always be disappointed. Sometimes the person didn't show, or showed up and acted distracted, or showed up and they weren't the person I hope they'd be. When you're needy you're very vulnerable to that actions of other people. Now that I'm more stable in my sense of self and have a better handle on my depression (thank you sertraline) I don't rely on people very much and that goes a long way in making incidences like the one you had not cause a downward emotional spiral like they used to for me. I hope someday you get to the stage in your life where you are less dependent on other people to make you feel good. And also I hope you get to a stage in your life where you have less flaky people in your life! I wish you the best of luck and all I can say is I've been there.",

Its the one thing that just keeps me sane and for some reason it generates energy and helps me to stay enthusiastic about other things as well.\n\n I'm a bit like you, I don't have any close friends and I have some family stuff to deal with as well so I can relate to that disappointment and dissatisfaction that you might have initially felt from your friend standing you up at the coffee shop. I live in Scotland so its almost unheard of for a bloke to invite another bloke for coffee but I dont drink alcohol and that makes it hard to make new friends as well although I've really begun doing things that I can only really enjoy on my own and that has been massively liberating for me. I've began reading again and I play a lot of videogames so that keeps me entertained in a solitary way. But I cannot stress enough how important long walks are to me for my mental and physical health. \n\nYou seem like a really emotionally mature lady who knows what she wants and knows what she doesn't want so its thrilling to read your post and see how your handling the situation that your in. \n\nI'm.sorry that your marriage isnt working out. I've been in a relationship for over a decade and tbh, we are really happy despite the pandemic and not having any friends to hang out with so I consider myself very fortunate in that regard but I've had losses in my life as well and your right that it is a grieving process. \n\nI wish you all the best for your future moving forward and I hope you stay active and keep getting out.

When I try to express my issues with depression, I get off the cuff remarks like \"try HTC that works\" but I don't want of f the cuff. I want to talk. And have someone listen.",

I was once supposed to catch up with a friend at a coffee shop and I guess she thought it was a date at the last-minute and ghosted me. This was when we were 18, so it's kind of forgivable but you're 24 so there's really no excuse.\n\nFuck people who do that, you deserve better. If there's a positive that you can take from this, it's that they showed you they're not worth your time anymore.",

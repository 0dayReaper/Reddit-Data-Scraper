In highschool I entered depression and no one in my life knew how to deal with it, so they either just screamed at me or where able to show me a momentary kindness. \n\nNothing helped, nothing worked. Counselors or doctors that I didn't hate, could do little for me, as most of my major problems could not be fixed because I could not achieve financial independenace or escape being trapped in a school. \n\nI've always been shy and unable to fit in anywhere. When I look back on my life, I don't know what choices I could have made differently that weren't based on pressure from my parents or because of how exhausted I was. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea last year and finally got that treated. I've always felt like a failure and that I've always felt like I had to try twice as hard to get what everyone else starts at. It took until this year to escape the control of a family member.\n\nI don't know if I ever had any humanity, and that at a young age every one just convinced me that it would show up one day.",

I\u2019ve been feeling a lot more \u201cme\u201d. Also there is a therapy called EMDR that I\u2019ve been doing. What it does is turn back on parts of the brain that have become disconnected from each other.  It helps people with PTSD stuff. When you talk about numbness I think that exists because of a disconnect from reality and what EMDR does is help you get back in touch with your true self.",

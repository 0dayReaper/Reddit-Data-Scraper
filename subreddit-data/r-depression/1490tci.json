    "postText": "despite being suicidal for many years, I never actually wrote a suicide note,  i guess I always assumed I would get better, and while it has, it hasn't gotten good enough. I don't plan on following through with them note tonight but it was a genuine goodbye to my family. I don't really know why I wrote it other than I just felt like it. I'm not going to follow through with it today, but I feel different after writing it, not sure how to describe it.",

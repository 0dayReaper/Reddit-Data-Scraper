I've always been super critical of myself and i believe that is why i began spiralling into depression. I've only recently escaped this by acting as apathetic, whimsical and \"critical\" as possible and that somehow lead to me finding things i enjoy. I still get an emotional breakdown every now and then but thankfully i've been getting back on my feet. \n\nAll i can say is realise that 1:life isn't meant to be taken seriously and 2: try to be as logical as you can; argue with your negative thoughts and write them in a journal. It's been a 2 year process but i wish everyone the best and hopefully I can fully pull my mind out of this hole. Peace.",

This is a side effect of a sickness that you have (depression), like any other sicknesses.\n\nEdit to add: after I recovered from my first major depressive episode, I didn't have a *personality* anymore. Like, what kind of person was I? What kind of things did I like? Nothing. I had to find out/build out those things again. I vividly remember telling this to a friend and him telling me \"you're a decent person, and a smart person, if this is happening to you it's happening to a lot of other people too, you're not the first.\" This had strangely comforted me, like knowing that this wasn't a weird thing I was doing to myself or that I was failing at that was my fault, you know? Same applies to you. You're not alone in this and it's not your fault.",

It's been 6 years since that happened, and although I did get better then, I don't think I got better all the way, until recently. I'm in therapy now and that helped a lot, yet still things come up that I used to like +6 years ago, like fountain pens or video games, which I somehow had got into the mindset that I didn't really like and felt more like an impostor. Just recently I came back into realizing I did use to like those things genuinely, if that makes sense? \n\nBut I did start feeling better those days - 6 years ago - even though I maybe wasn't better *all the way*. I had quit my job because of an unhealthy dynamic with my boss and all around stress, where I hadn't been able to function anymore, which was my lowest point. I spent a couple months unemployed, then got into another job, which wasn't at the best company but still made me feel better because I was relieved of guilting myself for not working and fearing I'd never be able to get another job. Then after a year I left my narcissist boyfriend of two years which helped A LOT. Like immediately in the first week of breaking up I felt lighter and more free. He was someone who devalued the thoughts and likes of everyone else, and I think maybe that played a part in me feeling like my likes weren't worthy enough. So years later, it turns out that.. *the video games were in me, all along*. The games are just an example though, but I nowadays realize that the things I used to think when I was younger (before I got worse and lost my personality) weren't lies and I WAS actually a pretty okay person and not an actual piece of shit. I know that all of us have different problems with different paths to resolve them, but I do hope yours will arrive at this place too. All I can say is, it's okay if you don't know what you like and where to go, it's okay if you come back to the person you were but it's also okay if you come out of this as a different person like a butterfly. We keep telling ourselves that we'd love ourselves if we \"just weren't a failure and were able to do x like everyone else\", but turns out the self love should come before, not after.\n\nI've rambled a lot and I don't know if any of this makes sense or is of any help at all. I feel like I'm at the end of a math problem which I solved for x, but can only talk about the answer and not the process of solving. If you have any means at all I'd immensely suggest talking to a therapist, it was (and is) easily the money best spent in my life. I'm unemployed again right now, and feel guilty about buying coffee beans for example, but I don't feel guilty for the money I spend on the therapy - because I know how I felt 8 months ago (when I started) and I know how I feel now.",

You might have to tray a few different ones because of side effects, etc. That's normal.\n\nI can't stress enough that ***you do not want to live with untreated depression.*** I did that for over 20 years and since getting treatment I have realized how fucking stupid that was. There is value in living and the only thing telling you otherwise is your illness.\n\nBe honest with youself and those who are close to you, and be open about your illness.

Its interesting to ask of course what makes us alive, the body or our brain, memories, etc.......... and what happens when the 2 are not in sync, or one exists without the other........\n\nBut then again, if free will does not exist, and things are simply a chain of cause and effect, was this doomed to happen all along? Is there anything we can do about this, or is our fate already decided..... What makes a life worth living? And find those things that make it worth living, because even if you fail, and perhaps failure was destined all along, at least you tried your best, and that can have intrinsic meaning if you believe in it..... although the choice is yours...",

I\u2019m 26, I\u2019ve learned to accept that I\u2019m mentally gone, and I\u2019ve been feeling better, there\u2019s days where I feel like I\u2019ve mentally came back to life and then proceed to have a panic attack because i was having an existential crisis. Hahaha but not everyone has the same life or goes through the same thing. Do small things that bring even the littlest joy to you. Even a small goal like reorganize your clothes, or do 15 jumping jacks! It\u2019s not a cure but sometimes you can enjoy the little things in life that are still there and not completely gone",

We broke up 2 months ago and still here I am just flowing the only difference is now not someone to hang out with and talk to daily, \n\nEven if I get back on track and in society and everything I think my isolation and not being part of society for like 3 years has done a permanent toll on me.",

It hit me everyday if I didn't born , wouldn't they be happy since I wasn't in their lives , I didn't save their lives or give helpful advice like a sage , I just do the same old labour ( cleaning , cooking and study) I'd feel the burden of \"strings\" attached me getting heavier and tighter with every fiber of my body  never in a single day that I missed to pray to God to take my life away in my sleep but to wake up every morning to still be \"alived\"but disappointed that I still breath instead of not . 'it' runs automatically everyday (bath eat work etc repeat) , I interpret that \"life\" is a curse not a gift , just to toil and work (even though mankind reach the epitome of tech advancement better than back then) we still suffer the dread , misery of this very \"existence\" yet some of us don't want to \"leave\" because of the fear of the \"unknown\" ,but then again we still look forward to it cuz we could \"rest\" peacefully without a care of the world.",

You were still young, there's no way you were that unhappy.\" Yeah, thanks. Now go tell that to the 10 year old that tried to kill themself and hasn't felt any joy since.",

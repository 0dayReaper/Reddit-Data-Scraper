    "postText": "I want to preface by saying that my suicidal thoughts are normal and have been for years now.\n\nA lot of days go by now and I feel lost and admittedly a little angry. My parents ruined my life with the decisions they made on my behalf growing up and I feel broken. A part of me doubts if I\u2019ll ever feel better. Things have just been grey and shitty for so long now that it surprises me that people usually DON\u2019T feel this way.\n\nMy suicidal thoughts have admittedly been turned outward as of late. I feel like my parents never cared for my wellbeing or who I am as a person. They only care about me insofar as a tool or in regards to how useful I am to them. I\u2019m not a person I\u2019m a machine.\n\nNow I\u2019m starting to think about killing my self out of spite. Afterall, they never cared about nor respected me or my words. Maybe they\u2019ll respect the noose around my neck then.",

But there\u2019s always one thing I think about; and that\u2019s if I\u2019m ever to do it, *I* want to be the one making that choice.\n\nYou\u2019ve said yourself that you personally don\u2019t feel like they care about you, that they made decisions *for* you that resulted in you feeling like this - well if you cross over that line out of spite, then that\u2019s no better than letting them make yet *another* choice for you.\n\nIt\u2019s maybe not a kind way to put it, and I will say if possible I\u2019d recommend speaking to your parents and letting your feelings be known, sometimes just being *heard* is enough to get the process of healing started - but I get not everyone\u2019s family situation is like that, not every one can be fixed. \n\nSo instead, all I can recommend is live your life for you. Easier said than done, I know - but even little personal decisions can feel monumental after a lifetime of people deciding what\u2019s \u2018best\u2019 for you.",

Yeah I can agree that when I do make decisions they feel like they have a lot of weight as I wasn\u2019t able to really do that in years past.\n\nI\u2019ve tried talking to them about my problems, they either don\u2019t get it or are too ambivalent/ pre-occupied to care (like most of my life lol).\n\nI\u2019m in therapy and take medication to try and fix it. I don\u2019t know what \u201cliving my life for me\u201d looks like or what I\u2019m supposed to do, I do things because I\u2019m obligated to do them more often than not (barring a few hobbies I have).",

I\u2019d love to be able to say I\u2019ve got the answer, but I sadly don\u2019t - I struggle with it myself and some days are much harder than others.\n\nThe way I (try) and manage it however is a simple belief of \u201cZero Compromise\u201d - and by that I mean beyond the necessary effort someone has to put in (school, work - those sorts of things) once the day is done I do whatever *I* want to do.\n\nIf someone invites me out but I\u2019d rather sit in and watch through a new series, I\u2019m not gonna force myself to go just to make someone else happy - in the same vein that if a certain family member of mine comes over, I don\u2019t force myself to be around them as it makes me uncomfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly an \u2018answer\u2019, because I don\u2019t think there really is one - for me, for now at least, life is just about having fun. That might change tomorrow, in a week, or a year - but for now I know what I want to focus on, and that keeps me going.",

    "postText": "tw: depression, thoughts of suicide\n\n\ni\u2019m a pastor and i hate myself. i make it seem like i\u2019m doing everything right and i\u2019m not. i\u2019ve been in church all of my life but i desperately want to know what life is like without it. i want to know what it\u2019s like to finally be free and totally live my truth. \n\ntoday due to unforeseen circumstances i had people from church over at my house. someone who\u2019s recently given up smoking weed (HUGE NO NO) might\u2019ve seen the wrapper to an 8th that i had.  not sure where she used to get her weed from but if she smoked she probably recognized the warning label. \n\nthinking about the possibility of the church finding out makes me want to die. i\u2019d rather be dead than actually face my actions. \n\ni\u2019m a fraud. i\u2019m everything wrong with the christian church. i feel like i don\u2019t deserve to live. \n\ni\u2019ve embarrassed myself, i\u2019ve disappointed God, i\u2019ve let my family down, i\u2019ve made such a terrible name for myself. \n\ni just don\u2019t wanna be here anymore.",

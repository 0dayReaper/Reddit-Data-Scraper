    "postText": "I had some distant family visit me for a couple of weeks. I love them dearly, but I find I struggle to share space with people for an extended period of time... feel pressure to tour them around, personal schedule and routines disrupted.\n\nA part of me awaits the day they go. However, when they finally do, I feel mildly depressed and lonesome.\n\nWhat the hell is that about? Is it simply about acclimating to an environment and struggling with change?",

I get annoyed at them for small things, I exhaust myself trying to mask my actual feelings and all in all I'm mentally spent by the time they leave, which makes it really easy for the loneliness to take over.\n\nI recently opened up to my closest friends about everything. My depression, getting into therapy, medication, all of it. Being around them actually gives me energy now rather than taking it away.\n\nThis doesn't really help the loneliness but at least it gets rid of that weird contradiction you described, at least for me. Find some people you can really open up to, if you haven't already, and try to see if you feel the same way if you've been around them.",

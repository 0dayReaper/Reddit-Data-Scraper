I mentionned a lot of times and they are totally numb, it feels like thei're thinking \"I see this everyday\" and I don't feel like they care, no matter how many times you have tried and that makes me feel more alone.\n\nI'd expect them at least the MINIMUM to try to reach out to my family but it seems like that idea doesn't even crosses their mind.\n\nI recently went with a new one and when I touched the subject she told me \"But like, SERIOUS su****e attempts not just taking 3 packs of pills with alchohol to see what happenes\"\n\nLike she or they expect me to stand in the exterior of the railing in some balcony in a tall building until the firefighters are called or something?\n\nYes?\n\nNo?\n\nI feel like it is.\n\nWhat do you think?",

I would think taking 3 packs of pills with alcohol is very concerning behaviour that needs to be taken seriously\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Like she or they expect me to stand in the exterior of the railing in some balcony in a tall building until the firefighters are called or something?\n\nThis made me chuckle\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've experienced something similar, one therapist seemed blase when I was talking about feeling hopeless and was visibly very distressed\n\nPersonally I think suicidal thoughts should always be taken seriously",

I only went with this one because it was free bc i'm in college.\n\nI thought about just do life as it is without therapy and maybe I'd learn something, but is hard when you don't have a support circle or family who cares about you.",

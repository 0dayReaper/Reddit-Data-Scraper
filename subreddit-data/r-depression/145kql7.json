    "postText": "So today my psychologist diagnosed me with depression with anhedonia on top of my anxiety an CPTSD, I always thought I was just over diagnosing myself but I wasn't, I never even mentioned  to my psychologist that I thought I had depression or anhedonia because I was still somehow functional and always thought depression was being super sad and not even wanting to get out of bed or even brushing your teeth.\n\nI'm sharing here because I don't have many people I can tell this and I don't know if I should feel relief or be more concerned by being diagnosed.\n\nIf you have any advice or stories about what you did after being diagnosed I would love to read them.",

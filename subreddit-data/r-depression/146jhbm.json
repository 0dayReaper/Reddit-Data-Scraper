Even when sometimes it's not my fault somehow I still blame myself for everything. Thinking about taking meds again, to hopefully minimize that paranoia. I feel like I'm losing it. Anyone have any suggestions?",

So many times people are consumed by intrusive thoughts and these little \u201cwhat ifs\u201d in their brain. These are almost never true and just feed off insecurities. Do not let your intrusive thoughts win. You are not the problem in life. Do not blame yourself for everything, please try to go easy on yourself",

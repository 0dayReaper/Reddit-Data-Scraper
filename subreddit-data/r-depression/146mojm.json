    "postText": "I\u2019m a medical student and I have a test in 6 weeks. It\u2019s one of the most important tests of my life. I\u2019m supposed to start my dedicated phase of prep but I feel like I\u2019ve lost the will to continue anymore. I\u2019ve been hustling for as long as I can remember and it just never seems to end. \n\nI had put in a lot of effort for a previous similar test, but ended up scoring much lower than what I expected. I was struggling a lot at the time. I was recovering from the aftermath of my friend/ med school senior sexually assaulting me and it took a huge toll on my mental health. I remember struggling to get his voice out of my head as I was reading the questions. I remember looking at my score and bawling my eyes out not knowing how to deal with the failure and blaming myself for everything.\n\nIt\u2019s been 2 years since the assault and I still get triggered unexpectedly. The other day I was doing a question on post exposure prophylaxis for a victim of sexual assault and all the emotions just hit me like a brick. And the cherry on top, I found out that the person who assaulted me matched into residency this year. I feel partly responsible because I did not report him. I had approached a trusted professor at the time but she turned out to be a friend of his and gaslighted me into thinking that I was responsible for everything. That I \u201cshould\u2019ve been more assertive\u201d or \u201cshould\u2019ve just left\u201d. She did not provide me with the needed support and medical care at the time and reading that question just snapped something in me. She basically manipulated me into not \u201cmaking a scene\u201d so he could go on to match into internal medicine like he always wanted because a criminal record would be a huge red flag. \n\nTherapy has helped to some extent. I have no idea how to deal with these triggers though. I haven\u2019t been able to talk to anyone either because it\u2019s a very heavy topic and I don\u2019t want to trauma dump on anyone. Tests and scores and everything seems really pointless. I want to give up on everything but I\u2019ve worked really hard for a very long time to give up on it now. I know I should be grateful that my parents can afford to fund my dream, but I don\u2019t know if this is all worth it. If life is worth it. \n\nFeels really unfair that I have to struggle to just get through the day when rapists are getting matched and becoming doctors without any consequences. Studying for this test really brings out all the bad memories. I feel like I\u2019m suffocating.",

Even if nothing happens, you may feel better knowing you tried to get justice for yourself. You could also report what your professor said to you. At least it would be on record somewhere. These people aren't fit to work in medicine\n\nI'm sorry for what this person did to you, and I'm sorry for how your professor treated you when you came to her for help. It's disturbing and disgusting",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nSo I\u2019m on vacation with my husband. We have been together for almost 10 years, married for 5 of those years. We have a very good marriage and my husband is my best friend. In the middle of the night, I couldn\u2019t sleep tonight and went looking for our melatonin gummies that he has. In his toiletries bag I found a bottle of zoloft. He\u2019s never indicated to me that he was struggling with mental health. I feel horrible that he hasn\u2019t told me. I\u2019m very open about the benefits of therapy and addressing mental health. I don\u2019t know why he would hide this from me. I want to let him know that I know so he knows that I\u2019m a safe space for him. I just don\u2019t know how I go about telling him that I found the prescription?? I don\u2019t want him to be ashamed or upset\n \nHow should I handle the situation?? Thank you in advance",

I wouldn\u2019t feel offended by him not telling you , I think it\u2019s just a man thing that he might feel that you will think differently of him which of course you never would. On a plus side, if he seems completely Normal and happy then it\u2019s good that his prescription is actually doing it\u2019s job.",

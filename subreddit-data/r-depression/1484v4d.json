I am currently on bupropion/wellbutrin, and i know i have to ween off of it but then i would still be taking the medication while pregnant until i\u2019m completely off. \n\ncan someone tell me if this medication is harmful to the baby or what i should do? I have an appointment with my doctor next week but that\u2019s a week too far. thanks in advance.",

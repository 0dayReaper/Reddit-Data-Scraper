    "postText": "Tw: suicidal ideation \nI have severe major depression. I know I\u2019ve relapsed. The thoughts about offing myself won\u2019t leave my head. It\u2019s not going to get any easier that\u2019s for sure. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to fight more because the fight only gets harder from here. I still live in abusive circumstances which I can\u2019t escape from due to my immigration status. I\u2019m still severely mentally ill and financially unstable. It\u2019s getting really lonely and really dark in my head. I can\u2019t see any hope. \n\nWhat do you do when you are once again being brought to the edge of killing yourself?",

And over time things have been getting a bit better. I used to actively like intensely fantasize during ideation spirals maybe a couple times a week. Now it\u2019s down to maybe once every few weeks.

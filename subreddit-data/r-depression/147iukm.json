    "postText": "Everybody wants a good education. I have been to six different schools.   \nEverybody wants a consistent life. I have lived in six different houses.   \nEverybody wants an easy love life. Im gay.   \nEverybody wants good friendships. I have few friends due to moving or my \u201cfriends\u201d being deliberately shitty to me or even taking advantage of me.   \nEverybody wants a good home life. My fathers racist, unapologetic, and manipulative, and my mother is narcissistic and lazy.  \nEverybody wants a healthy mindset. I have depression and ADHD.\n\nNone of this is fair. I wish I could start my life over as someone else, or even just be someone else. How am I supposed to go forward with life with this kind of a childhood? ",

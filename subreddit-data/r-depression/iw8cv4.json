    "postText": "I have full conversations with friends I don't have, about stories I haven't lived. I imagine how they'd respond and laugh at my jokes.\n\nI don't have any real friends, I spend my life alone because I have no real confidence in myself. I feel my youth wasting away and I hate who I am. I am unemployed so I couldn't have moved out from home.\n\nI imagine myself as a successful athlete (I know it's stupid) and I imagine how I'd interact with people and the questions they'd ask.\n\nIt's disappointing to come back to my real life and realize what I am. I've done nothing with my life for the past 8 years. And nothing is moving forward. I compare myself to other men my age, and I am a failure in every aspect. I am no better today than I was 5 years ago.\n\nI wish I could escape into my fantasies",

I picked in books a lot of books, never read a novel in life. Be it science philosophy, mental health, spirituality everything I could get my hands on. \n\nTwo things I discovered, it was through this journey that made a small impact everyone I finished a book. \nSecond, every book leads to one conclusion, you have to train your mind like your life depends on it. \nIt's not a fight, it's building an honest relationship with yourself, a safe place without judgement. \n\nI am on this path right now, I am gonna stay on it.",

After one week the fantasies would spin into a their \"own little independent episodes/adventures\" and in a time-span of aprox. 6-12 months they'd stop entirely. \n\nI personally believe that these fantasies are common among people that detest/hate the unspectacular monotonous every-day life. Today, I also know that this was a form of desire of my younger self to imagine myself to be successful in life, which in retrospect might be an unhealthy form of egoism, self-loathing and distorted view of my capabilities. On the other hand, I just really liked the stories those Series were telling and the beautiful sceneries.",

But, from the outside at least, I appear relatively normal, if a bit unlucky.\n\nI'm too lazy and scatterbrained for this, but could you put this imagination of yours into writing? Play to your strengths, you think you haven't got any, but I know people who haven't got any imagination.\n\nOne positive to feeling like a failure is that, the only way is up. Literally, doing anything, like going out for a walk, can be viewed as a step forward. \n\nHeres just a little tip that can sometimes help you out... I know it's hard, and it might feel like fake bullshit when you do it, but praise yourself for every little thing you do that is positive... brushed your teeth? Way to go! Ate some fruit/veg? Winner! Had a good interaction with the lady on till at the shop? Smashing it! \n\nComparing is the worst thing you can do. We all do it. But it's rarely good for us. All it is doing is standing in your way of progress, because nothing you ever do will seem good enough to you. Try to stop doing that. There will always be people who you feel are better than you, no matter what you achieve. Even they have people who they compare themselves to and make themselves feel like shit. \n\nTherapy would really help you out of this hole you've got yourself stuck in. You can get out of it and change your reality. I know it feels like you cant, and that's a Catch 22 because, first, you need to believe you can. Just for a minute.",

They are more pulling your own thoughts out of you, getting you to feel comfortable enough to explore your own mind and gently nudging you along the way, making you feel safe to say things out loud without judgement. They shouldn't be pushing you at all. But obviously, all therapists are different. \n\nSimply going to a therapist will probably be out of your comfort zone, perhaps tell them that from the off, and that you are literally just experimenting with talking to someone, opening up, building confidence. You know, tell them it needs to be gentle for you.",

There is obviously some value in exposure to things one is afraid of, but it's also important to remember you're paying the therapist to help you and it's your right to find a new one if they push you too hard or make you feel worse.\n\nIt sucks when it doesn't work out because it can feel like you're the reason, but it absolutely can be the therapist.\n\nA therapist that is good for you will help you to help yourself. They would never force you to do anything.",

In order to survive, it\u2019ll find weird or maladaptive ways of coping when it\u2019s important needs aren\u2019t being met, hence mental and emotional reliance on the imagination. Your imagination is a wonderful tool to possess, but unfortunately, that can also work against you in many ways. I hope you stay well or can be well despite struggling. I\u2019m rooting for you.",

I have always found it hard to believe that there could be anyone else as isolated as I have been, as whenever I have met others in the same boat they have always had at least one friend, or even a job to give them financial independence. I have never had a job in my life, I have zero life experience which only makes it harder to meet new people as I feel like I have nothing to talk about.\n\nBut (there's always a but), things can and WILL get better. I realised I was looking for people in the wrong place, trying to fit into a part of society that I really had no interest in. In my case, I love playing games, even though I'm not very good at them. I met my partner on GTA and because we got to know each other so well online, meeting was easy and natural. Now we live together and are preparing to move to his home country. My best friend is a girl I met on Club Penguin 10 years ago when we were children, and I have talked to her every day since. We are a part of each other's lives, we support each other, maybe we can't hang out in person because of distance, but the friendship is real.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, sometimes it's hard to be successful at something we don't really want. I tried to make friends in college, but I had absolutely nothing in common with any of them, and I only tried because I felt that I needed to fit in, not because I wanted their friendship. If you are interested in athletics, start off small. Check out some local Facebook groups, see the kind of people that are on there. Or maybe you have other interests that you could also check out. If there is something you love, embrace it and allow it to be a part of your life. You may just find some friends along the way who do understand you and where you don't feel the need to be anyone other than your true self. Do what makes YOU happy, the rest will follow in time. \ud83e\udd17",

Some of us like to live in our heads, and who has the right to tell is it's wrong? \n\nOne thing I will recommend, is looking into r/NoFap and/or r/Semenretention. You don't necessarily have to follow it to the last letter, just browse and get a general idea of how to go about it, and give it a try. You have nothing to lose, even if you think it's bullshit. \n\nIf nothing else, I hope you find a way to accept and love yourself. And who knows, maybe consider writing little short stories and maybe share some on here.",

I remember being in my early teens and walking down the streets of San Francisco buzzed snapping our fingers while pretending to be a 70s street dance gang. (That was actually a moment in my life!) I\u2019ll never forget that moment. I feel the warmth of it and that feeling of acceptance, it\u2019s amazing. \n\nThen I wake up. I remember it was over a decade ago. Now I\u2019m broken physically, and so different from the idealistic boy I was. Every time I try to ride the sleep inertia back into the dream, until my alarm goes off and reality beckons. \n\nI would be willing to build my life from scratch twice over to be with friends like that again.",

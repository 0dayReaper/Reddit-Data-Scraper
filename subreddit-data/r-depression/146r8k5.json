    "postText": "Im a 21 year old male, and i dont really know what i AM feeling right now. I have a strong suspicion that it might be depression, given what i have read about it, but im not sure. I have also tried to schedule an apointment with my university psycologist, but there is a very long waiting time and it Will probably take around 3 to 4 months before i can get a diagnose. I am going to atempt to describe what i am feeling right now although sometimes i dont think i can explain it very well.\n\nFirst of all, the feelings and simptoms i Will be describing have been slowly creeping in. I think the first thing i noticed was a general lack off motivation, arround 3/4 months ago. Usually university related stuff, but i was finding it a lot harder to study for exams or to finish presentations in time. Right now it has transformed into a lack of motivation to the point where the Simple act of getting out of bed in the morning is a problem. Also before i would still study although with a lot more dificulty, but right now i just cant at all. I just sit on front of my PC and books for hours on end without actually doing anything. Because of this my grades are kinda bad right now and i think i might fail half of the classes i have this semestre( for context i have allways been an exemplary student, 0 faild classes and all with above averege grades). Even thinks that i enjoy, like going to the gym, or more worringly playing guitar, fell like too much work and i just dont do it. I think the last time i played guitar was like a month ago and i would usually play like every other day.\n\nAnother thing that i feel is a general numbness. I cant really explain it in any other way other than numb... I just feel nothing at all. But at the same time i feel really shitty. I dont know if i am explaining things well, but thats just what i feel\n\nMy sleep is also not very well. I tend to not be able to sleep at night due to anxiaty. I also tend to sleep during the day becouse i am extreamly tired because i cant sleep at night. I think i am sleeping at most 5/6h a night plus wtv i sleep during the day because i feel tired. Given that, i of course also feel exhausted and without energy to do anything. I think this also ties in with the lack of motivation. I dont have the energy to go out with friends or to go to the gym. I just want to Stay home all the time in my bed (what i am doing right now). \n\nI also feel really lonely. Its really stupid, because, although i dont have a huge amount of friends, the ones i do have are extreamly close to me. However i feel like i cant talk to them... My girlfriend is now also going through a very deep depression (diagnosed), along with self harm and suicidal thoughts, so the last thing i would do is burden her with my problems, as She already has too much to handle. And with my friends i think i wouldnt be Taken seriously as i have generly allways been the mentaly ealthy One and it wouldnt make sense for me to be feeling the way i do (and i do agree that there is no reson for me to be feeling this way... I just do). Maybe this os not what would happen and they would be really helpfull however i cant bring myself to talk to any of them and soo i feel like i have to surfer through all this Alone. I also would beber tell my psrents btw, i love them and they have been incredible parents to me but they do not understand mental health and would just say that a am being lazy (they already say this btw).\n\nLastly i feel disconected from everything. Its not like i am allways sad or anything like that, but i feel like i am not a part of the world arround me and whenever i am Alone the world seems like a diferent place to where i AM.\n\nThank you for reading this. Also just to clarify i have never had any thoughts off suicide or self harm. Also sorry for my sloppy English, i am Portuguese.",

            "comment": "Yes it sounds like you are struggling with depression \n\nI'm sorry for what your parents said about you being lazy, I strongly disagree with them. Unfortunately ignorant people can cast unhelpful judgements upon people struggling with mental health issues\n\nIn regards to fatigue I would suggest getting blood tests and taking supplements for any vitamin or mineral deficiencies you have\n\nConsider studying part-time\n\nThere may be mental health support groups or programs at your institution. You might also find some through a website called MeetUp",

I regards to the blood tests i Will be going to the doctor in the Next week as i have been ill quite frequently lately and i Will bring that up to see if something wrong. Althought i think the fatige may be related to the lack of sleep.\n\nStudying part time seems like a good idea, but i feel like i cant really do it as i still live with my parents and they pay for my education and i dont se them agreeing with it. I know i can live by myself and work while studying but i would lose a lot of benefits with that (mostly health ensurance, it works very diferently on Portugal but basiclay if i stop living with my parents i lose it). I also feel a lot of presure From them to finish university this year and with good grades, whtch to me seems Impossible in the State i am at",

If they won't allow it, you could also ask them if they would pay for you to see a therapist to support you whilst you're studying full-time\n\nPerhaps you can take a break from study, work full-time and save money to support yourself independently, and after a year start part-time study",

Thats the reason i am resorting to my university social services, witch are free.\nEither way i Will have to think about what i want to do, probably take a break for a while to think about my options. I also dont want to create a drift between me and my parents as again, although they are definetly not perfect, i do think they are good and loving parents.\nI think all probably take a job during the summer and see where ir goes from there.\nThank you very much for the help, i kinda needed to vent out",

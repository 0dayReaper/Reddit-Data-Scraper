    "postText": "I'm a 19M College Student who just finished his first year of college. I just got home and I've felt terrible. The second half of this school year I struggled quite hard and thought about killing myself a decent amount. Somehow coming home has also been bad however, which is kinda a surprise to me. I wanted to change schools, but now I'm not sure given how rough being home has been, my college does not seem that bad anymore, but I really don't know what to do. \n\nI have treatment resistant depression, and neither drugs or therapy have ever helped. I think it really all stems from my parents, who I've never been able to have a relationship (or at least positive relationship with) since I was young. While everyone else has this basis of support, I feel like I have nothing. I know that for me, filling that need of the basis of support basically fixes my depression. \n\nbut part of my struggle this year at school is not being able to make those connections that felt like they actually mattered, as well as the city I was in being run down and extremely cold in the winter (basically killing the chance to meet people aswell as making my depression worse). as much as I went and talked and hung-out with different people, I made friends with one girl that was significant who helps me a lot, but nothing else really felt right. I thought that maybe going to a different school would improve this, but now the thought almost scares me of leaving behind the connections I started to make and her (while at the same time I worry about relying on her too much). \n\nI get pretty down about it because as much as I do really focus on being a great friend to people, I've felt I always have struggled to make the type of connections with people I want. Especially with relationships, it seems other people can almost trip into a relationship while I can try so hard and get nowhere. It's pretty frustrating because I can have a conversation with nearly anyone, hangout with any friend group, and make friends with strangers but I can't for the life of me (literally) make deep connections with other people; which is literally the only one skill I would need to be happy. \n\nMy main concern is that while moving schools (out of state) seems like generally a better move for me,  I'm not sure I'll be able to do it and be successful without emotionally supportive parents and without my limited college friend group and that being alone somewhere new will be too much for me. I really don't know what to do and I'm just terrified I'm going to fuck everything up.",

I've tried moving states a lot, and I was still depressed. \n\nI thought new places would bring me new opportunities but really the farther I got from the support system I had built, the more isolated I felt.\n\nDepression doesn't disappear the farther you get away from it. It follows you everywhere.",

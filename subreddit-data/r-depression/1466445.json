    "postText": "So I\u2019m already at a low point. I\u2019m behind at uni, my work clients are chasing me as I\u2019m behind at work because of university. My 8 year old daughter has just been diagnosed adhd, and I\u2019m ruining her brain as I don\u2019t know how to communicate with her. My dog has cancer he is dying. On top of this is my normal where I have no self esteem I\u2019m ugly fat and old, I hate my mirror I hate my wardrobe. There is no joy left in my life. I have undiagnosed depression, general anxiety, adhd, problems with perfection. Recently my husband out of the blue suggested an open marriage and I have never felt lower. It\u2019s because of the way I look, it\u2019s because of me he wants to sleep with other people and I just cannot deal with this rejection. Why am I even here? What am I contributing? There is nothing benefiting from me walking in this Earth and I\u2019m just feeling rejected and low.",

The suggestion I have is considerably prioritize what matters to you the most. If you disagree with your husbands idea of an open marriage talk to him about it and discuss the other struggles you\u2019re facing as well. It\u2019s not just your job alone to raise your child and a partner should support you through this hard time. I don\u2019t know your story so I\u2019m just saying purely based on what you\u2019ve posted. Also I\u2019m sorry about your dog :( and I wish you strength in this hard time",

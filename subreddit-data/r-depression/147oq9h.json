    "postText": "Lately I\u2019ve begun thinking about where I\u2019ll end up in the future, like realistically.\nI think even if I accomplish every single dream and goal I have in life, in the end, I\u2019ll still end up alone, torn, and hating myself.\n\nI want to be a filmmaker, and found a studio that supplies its filmmakers and employees with 24/7 access to free mental health resources, and ongoing therapy as long as they\u2019re with the company. I want to help people. And yet even if I accomplish that, I still feel as if I won\u2019t be needed at all after a while. Not wanted by anyone.\n\nI think one day I\u2019ll end it myself. Sitting in an office or in my bedroom. I\u2019ll wait til a sunset. For some reason sunsets are the closest to feeling like God is talking to me. And I\u2019ll say goodnight, and maybe a few people will cry, but no one will need me. \n\nAfter I\u2019ve done everything I want to, I won\u2019t have much reason to be here. My days are pretty much numbered and I see that now.",

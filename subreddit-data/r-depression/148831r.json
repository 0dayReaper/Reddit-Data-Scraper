    "postText": "This is mostly me just ranting, i dont really have anyone in my life i can open up to much.  \n\nI was in a relationship for 3 years. It was the best thing to have ever happened to me. She was everything to me. I believed i could live my entire life with her and not regret a single day. We were in a long distance, but just knowing she's a part of my life made everything worth it. I was willing to wait for our lives to fall in space together. I was depressed before her and dating her didn't cure it, but it finally felt like i knew moments of happiness. I had a pillar of support, someone who understood me, knew every part of my life and accepted me for who i am. And then my depression got worse, and i was in a completely new environment, one which didn't provide me much support.  \nWe had a lot more fights, minor misunderstandings. Lot of them were my own overthinking and inability to control my emotions (during my extreme phases i tended to have less control over myself). \nWe broke up 4 months ago. My mental health got too hard for her to deal w. I've always known it's hard for other people to deal w my shit, it gets very heavy, it's hard to even share this burden. But she wanted to, said she wants to be there for me, but eventually it got too much. This wasn't the only reason, there were others. Breaking up made sense. Unfortunately.  I knew it was probably best for her, and that made it easier to deal with. Knowing at least her mental health will be better. \nAfter the breakup, i gave myself into the healing process. Knowing it's what she would've wanted. Not as a way to get her back, but i just got tired of always being this incredibly messed up guy. I opened up to two of my best friends. We don't really talk much anymore. Idk how much of it is my fault. \nAfter all this i stopped opening up about my problems to others. I can't open up n have them be pushed away too. Can't burden them, when they also have their own lives. I've spent the last 4 months smoking, drinking, getting high. I'm high functioning so everyday i push and get myself to keep a good personality for others sake. Get the work done. It made it easier to abuse substances cuz i knew I'll still function. \nEvery day I want to kill myself. Not an hour passes where i wonder if i can just finally relax, let go. I don't tho. I would disappoint a lot of people. Maybe I'm a coward. \nWhen i try to imagine a future (daydreaming, making up scenarios) even then, even hypothetically, i just can't imagine a life without being depressed. It's settled under my skin so snugly i can't tell the days when it's a part of me, just something that's a part of my soul, or idk a product of the life I've lived. \nIs there a difference in curing genetic mental illnesses and acquired ones? My family has a history. \nI'm tired. I'll still get up, I'll still work. I'll still do my best to maintain relations. \nBut I'm tired. And having lost the literal only person i truly cared about, has made me wonder if i will ever have a life where i can feel loved and supported. \n\nSorry for having wasted the time of whoever read this. I haven't let my thoughts out in months, i woke up 10min back and i probably don't make any sense, not even to me. Good talk.",

I loved her more than life itself\nOf course that's nit not good\n\nIf had any left your story might bolster hope. Thanks",

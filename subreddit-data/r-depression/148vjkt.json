    "postText": "Hi everyone, I had mental health issues on and off from ages 14-20, it got a little better around 21/22 but when the pandemic hit I went downhill again, culminating in a complete nervous breakdown when I was a few months away from turning 25 (it was really bad, I don\u2019t want to get into all the details but it was so bad that my doctor thought I was bipolar and I almost had to be hospitalized).\n\nI have an okay job now and am doing a little better, but I\u2019m single, had to move back in with my parents, alienated myself from a lot of my friends and have no real life goals. I see my peers doing things like going to grad school, getting married, travelling the world, having adventures and I feel like such a complete failure and like I\u2019ve made every mistake and ruined my life. I also struggle with feeling old and like I\u2019ve run out of time.\n\nI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m posting this, but sometimes I just wish the world would stop so I could relax and focus on getting better - but while I \u2018focus on me\u2019 time is still passing, I\u2019m getting older, not enjoying my youth and not building my career, savings, relationships etc. the constant pressure of time passing and worrying about what to do with my life is really getting in the way of my recovery. I feel like such a total failure and sometimes I just wish I could disappear and not be a disappointment. \n\nI don\u2019t know, does anyone else feel the same way?",

I\u2019m still trying to accept that I\u2019m older and I\u2019m going to keep aging no matter what, and it\u2019s very hard. I\u2019m disconnected and resent my younger self because I can\u2019t go back and fix all the time I wasted sitting around watching YouTube videos and porn. Never been in a relationship, I get jealous of everyone, no matter what their problems are. I am controlled by my ego and my ego drives me into the Fucking dirt, beating the shit out of my mind every fucking day. I\u2019m in a prison of my own mind",

You're not alone in dealing with a mental condition &amp; feeling like that.\n\n\nYou have a job, so that's 1 positive (even if someone's out of work due to an illness, it doesn't mean it's a bad thing anyway), you hopefully have a secure place to be living &amp; friendships can be rebuilt/new 1s made. We also put too much pressure on goals due to peer pressure &amp; social media.\n\n\n(This next part's about me, so feel free to ignore as I don't want to come across as diverting to my issues/trying to dismiss what you've wrote.)\n\n\nI did get hospitalised myself on a psych ward for a year due to being so underweight, nearly went into a coma, managed to make it to a normal weight &amp; went through 5 years of mistreatment in mental services after that. I'm not putting this here to complain, but to show everyone has different experiences &amp; if people can survive that, you can manage this.\n\n\nReading what you've wrote, I wouldn't consider you a failure in the slightest, it takes strength to keep going when you deal with a condition, physical or mental &amp; you should be proud of yourself.\n\n\nLastly, I also think a lot of people around our age put a lot of focus on aging, myself included, but it's not like things suddenly change when we hit 30 or whatever age. I figured out I put a lot of focus on the age point due to the time I mentioned above being wasted/the mistreatment &amp; not getting to date/do social things at the time.\n\n\nSorry for the text wall also lmao. I hope this is somehow useful in any way.",

I also have OCD (that\u2019s what I ended up being diagnosed with after my total breakdown) and once I got the diagnosis it made a lot of sense to me and contextualized a lot of the mental health struggles I had as a teenager. OCD is a lot to deal with and definitely is part of the reason I feel so depressed. You seem like a really strong person and I hope things get better for you too :)",

I've been slowly trying to claw back things, as hard as it is, but you should be genuinely extremely proud of yourself. I'm currently out of work due to the OCD, but being diagnosed soon &amp; hoping to shove as much as I can to get closer to any goals, no matter how small.\n\n\nI hope you have a better day tomorrow, as I know it can be such a big contrast from day to day when we've got this condition.",

I think frequently about what you describe--if I could just earmark a couple of weeks or months to rearrange the parts that feel out of place, everything would be great.  I have the PTO to do it...sort of, but what could I really do that would so easily change my life?  \n  \nThere are no rules or easy paths to anything.  I won't pretend to know why you feel your life is in a dire situation, but at the same time I can at least say that with 13 \"extra years of life experience\" if you are able to worry about this then you haven't messed up anything permanently and even with all of my so called failures I've also learned to recognize that....well, there are a lot of ways that I am built different and it's okay.  \n  \nI do struggle sometimes with feeling like I am getting older and nothing changes, but I also have to check myself--what do I expect to change?  Have I changed in a way that those wanted or expected changes make sense?  The answer is usually no, with a hefty side of self-examination.",

I'm in a situation where I feel like I've been ready to start my next chapter for years but just never made that big leap of faith. I knew I wanted to move to another city in 2018-2019, but didn't do it. I wanted to quit my career and be a free spirit traveling and living in the desert, but didn't do it. \n\nI hate to say it, but life only gets more stressful. And the older you get, the less empathy people have for you. When you live with and deal with clinical depression in your early to mid-30s, people really start drifting from you and distancing themselves from you. It's really tough and hurts very badly. The only thing keeping me going anymore is my kid and the hope that maybe one day, I'll finally get to live that dream life of mine in the desert.",

If 3-5 years if you could have anything what would you need to have that fulfilling rewarding life. \n\nJob, family, health, money, house, whatever it is. Be honest with yourself and be realistic. If you write down \"I want to marry Leo and be a brain surgeon\" you're just lying to yourself. So be honest. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Implant it in your mind. \n\nThen make a plan. Step by step. Attainable steps. One at a time. Start snowballing the progression. \n\nI know its hard. I have lived with depression my entire adult life. A month ago I left everything to cycle across Canada to heal myself, and while I don't recommend setting a goal that large, I can honestly say that the support I've got, has given me motivation and purpose and my physical health improving and the snowballing of progression my mental health is improving and I'm working towards that magical Christmas land scenario I wrote down. \n\nBe selfish with your needs.

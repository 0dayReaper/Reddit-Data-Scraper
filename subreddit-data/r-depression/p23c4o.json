The only way I survive some days is just to keep reminding myself, the intensity of this feeling will pass. \n\nI know I am not, but I sometimes can relate to bipolar people. Sunday night I felt really suicidal, I'm worthless, a burden, i am a terrible mother and my kids will resent me etc come Monday, I felt better, monday afternoon after spending time with a friend in the sunshine I felt even better. How quickly my mood can change can sometimes be very annoying but I guess going from suicidal to not can't be all bad.\n\nJust keep telling yourself, this feeling will pass, I will be ok.

If I am happy, I'm really happy, and if I am sad, well yeah. \n\nSo maybe in a way, we are lucky, or at least that's one way we can look at it. Other people will have steady emotions, never feel extremes either way, but we can feel really high levels of happiness....that get balanced out (or outweighed) by depressive episodes.",

My father told me 15 years ago I had a lot of friends and now none. None stayed with me and I have noone to talk to. It was sad to hear that but I didn't realised until 3 years ago something simmar happend to me too. I saw how many people I knew shared things with, how we did a lot of stuff and were there for each other, but at one point it just faded away. I want to tell you be lucky if you have a handful of people by your side, those handful mean more than everyone else. Don't be sad because some left, but be happy someone stayed. Hold tight to them because you don't want to lose them, if they leave then you'll be completely alone. I have 2 best friends in my surroundings and I'm happy as heck to have them, I cherish them more than everything. Wish you all the best (:",

I also remember a lot of things that I did in the past and it just screwes me over. I kinda overcame this feeling fast once:\n\nWas on a wedding and on the same day I was the godfather of my best buddies son (they combined the two things into one day bcs of covid). I drew my moms car to the wedding and something was wrong it started to smell badly from the car. My mom said she had to leave home and called me later that  she couldn't drive the car for more than 30 km/h (18,6 mp/h) and is not comming back. My day was ruined and it should have been the best day because I finally came home to my family after year and a half. I had a fucked up episode. I couldn't move, couldn't think, was unmotivated. The only thoughts were I fucked up the car, have to buy a new one even though at that point I was out of money (still am haha). And later I was thinking I can't be like that my friends didn't deserve to see me like that. I realised I have to do something so when I saw people dancing and there was good music I pushed my self to just leave my burden alone and have fun. Noone knows I am depressed so thats one point I should put out. I took my beer, danced and had a blast. It was horrible in the beginning but later it was amazing. 3 hours later my mom just came as a surprise and told me she didn't check the oil in the machine (facepalm). It was all out haha (we have a older car). So this episode that I imagined in my head was stupid, I dragged myself down and later everything was allright. I hate it when that happens and it happens a lot. And yes this is the first time I overcame the feeling. Then I realised how much do I have to work on my self and think less of stupid things that might have happend. Its hard AF for me.",

It's weird but I know exactly how I'd do it and several alternatives, my preferences, spent years researching timing, methods and exact percentage outcomes, stats looking for the perfect one. Never found what I was looking for, or maybe I found everything out but what I wanted wasn't in there. \n\nI took the power away that way in a way. I've lived a hollow life for many years since but..\n\nI'm still here. Shit gets a little less hollowed as time Flys past. I guess I reached fuck it. Let's make a new purpose, and I was in the job that gave me first hand opportunity to help others in my life long Crisis. It gave me meaning. It gave me purpose. I guess I'm still living that purpose, but my strength now came from my weakness before. I feel many like me can find a purpose, or an anchor(s). Keeps a man alive. Keeps a man living, to find further purpose. Meaning. I hope you find your meaning man.\n\nTake it from me, you got work to do.

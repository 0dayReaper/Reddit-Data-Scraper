    "postText": "I\u2019ve hit such a low point even my medication doesn\u2019t seem to be working. \n\nI\u2019m having medical problems that are worrying me, my life direction is worrying me. I can\u2019t avoid these daily thoughts anymore of how I would be better dead. \n\nI may be infertile and the thought of never being able to have children would leave my life meaningless. I just wouldn\u2019t be able to continue if that\u2019s the case. Who would want a partner that can\u2019t reproduce offspring? I would never be able to adopt if it came to that because I wouldn\u2019t feel that inherent bond between myself and a child that doesn\u2019t share my biological DNA. I get this is speculation and I don\u2019t know for sure yet but the anxiety is tearing me up. \n\nOf course \u201clife is unfair\u201d but this straight up BS. Like hear me out, Nature decides who reproduces based on strong genetics and the weaker genes get phased out. Why the fuck is Nature so ruthless? Nature doesn\u2019t give a fuck about my feelings. How is this \u201cfair and balanced\u201d in a reality in which natural selection determines whether we reproduce or find a mate or succeed in life? Sure, there inherently is no true balance. It\u2019s all chaos. The universe was born of chaos. There is no order to this madness. \n\nHow is someone\u2019s life to be summed up by whether they are naturally selected to die early? To not be fertile? To be alone? Etc. \n\nAre some of us destined to suffer? Is this just another divine test for us to pass? What does it even matter at this point. We\u2019re not even in control of anything. Life just deals us cards randomly and we are expected to roll with it? Wtf kind of omnipotent being would conjure up such a miserable existence? You almost have to take into question whether our suffering is intended.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve always found it hard to communicate or even to talk socially, is it my breath or the fact I\u2019m into women, that I can never make friends. I just don\u2019t know how to carry a conversation on . I have one best friend which I\u2019ve started to realise I\u2019ve lost a long time ago, the friendship isn\u2019t the same anymore . I lost my best friend my whole world, my dog called Max last year. He was my life . It never seems to get easier, trying to find reasons to carry on or face the fact I should be with him like I promised. But yet I still find fight inside me to carry on and make him proud. \nI\u2019m here for a few reasons and I\u2019ll stay till all those reasons have gone. \nThat day I lost him changed me forever. I don\u2019t know who I am anymore, I have elimpses of me before me randomly pop up . \nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m even writing this.\nNothing will change \nIt\u2019s just the way it is, that\u2019s life.\nBut thankyou for letting me write this down.\nI\u2019ve come to realise it will what will be, I just have to make the most out of it and make the best memories.",

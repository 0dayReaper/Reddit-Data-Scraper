    "postText": "People who see me as weak don\u2019t realize the strength it takes for me to not unalive myself\u2026I\u2019m surprised I even made it this far\u2026They say that people like me aren\u2019t meant to last long\u2026I\u2019m introverted, Im 26 but look and sound like a kid so no one takes me seriously.  I also have chronic illnesses that prevent me from keeping a job cause I constantly need to take a day off. I\u2019m always tired and losing track of time and forgetting things. I want to get help but I don\u2019t have the money. I tried to talk to my family but they don\u2019t take me seriously. They tell me I need to get out of my comfort zone but I never really had one. I\u2019m constantly trying new things and doing things I\u2019m scared of but it\u2019s never enough. I just came back from a month long vacation in South Korea/ Bali feeling more lost than ever. My problems followed me and I realized that no matter where I go or what I do, I can\u2019t run away from myself or issues. People probably see me as selfish but idc anymore. I\u2019m tired and burnt out from all the expectations &amp; experiences. This isn\u2019t a suicide post but I honestly don\u2019t have the will to live anymore. People tell me I need to stop waiting for life to happen but the truth is I\u2019m waiting for death\u2026.I just want peace and be fully present but I can\u2019t seem to grasp it.",

They can be helpful in supporting you to organise your life. Additionally they can give you a safe environment to explore your emotions and feelings.\n\nWishing you all the best, take care.",

It\u2019s hard when people don\u2019t understand what you are going through but time heals most things so just be patient. Try talking to a GP\nor a therapist. Personally for me I feel better when I talk to people about my struggles",

    "postText": "I 22M work 40 hours a week, I spend my nights more and more recently playing Skyrim building a life I can be proud of in there. (I feel like an incel writing this) I have a lot of trauma from my past, and I have major depressive disorder, adhd, panic disorder, and really high anxiety problems. But I am very much high functioning, I own my own business, I\u2019m somewhat wealthy. I\u2019m decent looking I\u2019m 5\u20196 180lbs (bodybuilder) I spend a lot of my time working out, working, playing games, working, spending time with family etc. I am genuinely just not a happy guy I seem like it to everyone else, it is genuinely a mask. I\u2019m very tired I don\u2019t like being a high functioning depressed person, I\u2019m exhausted, I dislike waking up and going through my day, I don\u2019t have any weird views on women or any weird views on the world in relatively normal other than I drive a civic and drive a bit to quick. Anyway, I have always had trouble with loneliness, I\u2019m ok seeing everyone around me happy and living it up but it tears me up very much so that it\u2019s hurting me seeing them so happy. It\u2019s mainly dudes that I\u2019m friends with we don\u2019t really talk about our feelings much. I have already been to therapy a few times and been on dozens of medications all of them have sent me into a spiral of panic attacks. The thing that works for a temporary time is the gym and sleeping. That\u2019s about it, I don\u2019t know what todo much anymore I have recently just shut my brain off when doing anything other than the gym. I am very tired. I can\u2019t unalive myself because I have a lot of compassion and love for my family and friends that trumps the hate for myself and how much agony every waking moment feels.",

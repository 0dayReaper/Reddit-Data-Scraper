    "postText": "After about 3 years in therapy with 2 different psychologists and a year of antidepressants, I feel confident I have the tools to recognize when I\u2019m having a depressive episode and how to get myself out of it. The issue is, idk if I\u2019m ever fully out of it, because I don\u2019t completely believe the tools are real. My therapists have given me great mental tactics to combat dark thoughts, but I don\u2019t believe them, I still believe the dark thoughts. I\u2019m going into my thirties a truly jealous, miserable, deeply depressed person and I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019ll always be like this. Lately I\u2019ve been daydreaming about accidentally dying just so I don\u2019t have to see my friends post pictures of them with their significant others, because my happiness for them is so strongly overshadowed by my horrible loneliness. My therapist would say \u201cthis doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have someone some day too\u201d, but I just don\u2019t even believe that. I got to a point I wouldn\u2019t believe anything my last therapist said. It feels like I\u2019ve done good in therapy and genuinely tried to work with the tools I learned, but it seems like my depression is smarter. I\u2019m hopeless at this point. Every trigger no matter how small sends me into a spiral at this point. Idk what to do",

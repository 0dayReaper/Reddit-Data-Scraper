    "postText": "So my friend is in a very happy relationship, and of course that's amazing and I'm so happy for him. Meanwhile, I'm single and I've been wanting a relationship and he knows this. I feel like SO often he sends me pictures of him and his SO together, and it's so easy to trigger those depressed/lonely feelings for me whenever he sends those pics. I wish he had the same type of awareness that I do when it comes to situations like this. Like when I was in a relationship and he was lonely and single, I never wanted to \"shove it in his face\" and send pictures of me with my (now ex)boyfriend, because I knew how lonely he was, and I didn't wanna trigger those feelings for him. But he doesn't realize that everytime he sends a picture (especially when I'm already in a very lonely/depressed mood) it just makes me sad about my own life. And I know that's really selfish of me, and I should just be happy for him without the jealousy. But it's really hard when you're depressed and lonely. I just wish he knew that sending me happy smiling pictures of him and his SO all the time is very triggering for someone who really wants a relationship and is lonely, and sick of seeing all the happy couples everywhere.",

Get outside of your home, and look for signs. \n\nBut you need to have an open heart to meet that special someone, so be kind to the people you meet, and have patience - you don't want an unspecial person...\n\nMaybe you'll make some new friends who will introduce you or something? \n\nWho knows?

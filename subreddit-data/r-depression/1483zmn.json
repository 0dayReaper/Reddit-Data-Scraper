    "postText": "I (24f) have always felt an emptiness inside me where nothing truly makes me happy and everyday I live with the sinking feeling of going home but I don\u2019t know where home is. Recently I started trying to get back out there and be high functioning but everyday I am reminded why I do not want to be here. Everyday I go through the motions of smiling and waving and conversation even tho I\u2019m mentally not even there but it becomes more evident the longer I stay where I am that I am expendable. I do not belong. I have always been treated unfairly by family like getting told to shut up or quiet down when simply talking among other thing. Today the feeling just got bigger and bigger. I just wanted to disappear and stop existing. I\u2019ve never fully enjoyed life in any way that felt real to me. I live in a daze of suicidal thoughts and tired emptiness. Either way my soul wants to go home. I was born tired.",

            "comment": "So sorry. Wish I could say something to help you. Sounds like you have some bad family members. Any way you can get away from them? Or are you stuck? I think you need to get away from these toxic people in your life. Sometimes you have to cut family members out. Even parents, even adult children. We all feel this loyalty to family but when they are abusive, they lose their worthiness of your loyalty. It is a sad fact of life. We all want great parents and siblings and kids. My harshest realities have been accepting that some family members are not good people and there is no reason to be around them or close to them. When I challenge them on their bad behavior all they say is there is something wrong with me or that I am being sensitive. Neither is true. The only truth is they are assholes. Thats the excuse they use when I back them into a corner and call them out on their crap. Leave them. Leave them in the dust and move forward.",

I am not financially stable and I have a lot of other factors in why I can\u2019t leave soon but one day. Even tho they are a part of the feeling I get  I have always felt this way since I can remember. I am truly grateful for your words of encouragement and hope to one day use them. But till now I just have to continue",

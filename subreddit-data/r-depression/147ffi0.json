    "postText": "I feel like I\u2019m stuck in the past. So tonight I can\u2019t stop thinking about when I was a temp for like 3 months and this was my first job. My mgr was sweet at first and would always praise me and say how she\u2019s gonna miss me, she was just really compassionate. Then it turned, somewhere down the line I forgot everything I taught the first day and kept making mistakes and forgetting things. Then one day, she snapped at me like \u201cI can\u2019t keep re teaching you things. I expect you to keep up\u201d. And I just broke, I started crying \u2026I excused myself and cried for like 45 minutes to 1 hr. Luckily it wasn\u2019t a lot of people in the office and we were on zoom. I later explained to her \u201chey I understand your frustration and I\u2019m frustrated at myself too. But I got trained for this position for like 4 days and then my very first day, I did something completely different from what I was trained on\u201d.\nShe was just very accusatory. She tried to accuse me of stealing company time, whole time I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s better if I come in early to start and work on things that need to be, and leave late to finish anything. They were very adamant on not wanting to pay me for overtime which was fine. I didn\u2019t want the money, I just wanted to finish my work even if that meant I work 1-2 hours overtime or started 1-2 early.\nAnyway, I cringe thinking about that moment. I hate that I cried. Everytime I think of her face I shudder bc she started out so sweet and she probably is a sweet person outside of a work setting but that just stuck with me. I was stressed bc she told me to ask questions before doing anything but then got mad at me for asking. \nNeedless to say, I wasn\u2019t happy. I thought I would be happy because this was a iconic company and she seemed sweet. But towards the end, I was like \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d. It taught me an important lesson though that I try to remember, just because you have that \u201cdream job\u201d doesn\u2019t equates to happiness. Granted it was temporary but I always thought one I get my first real dream job, my depression would probably vanish or lighten up\u2026.it didn\u2019t. I cried alot when I was working from home.",

    "postText": "My psychologist is discontinuing my ADHD  medicine (prescribed by my GP). He says once my new antidepressant starts working, my happiness and wellbeing will help me to concentrate......is it just me, or is that a crock of bull?\n\nI could NEVER concentrate, my whole life  until being medicated. Now this guy tells me to 'lean on my coworkers for support'. Ummm, if I had my medicine, I wouldn't have to rely on my coworkers. I'm truly afraid for my job.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is there any merit to this guy's thinking?",

ADHD is a real thing, but some anti depressant medication have multiple uses, it might be able to control you ADHD too, if you are really off the rails after a couple of weeks on the new meds. go back to your GP. here if you wanna talk.",

He might think it\u2019s manageable and that with better mental health you\u2019ll have a better handle on it. Be careful with the side effects of anti depressants and let your doctor know immediately if it gets worse. Sadly a side effect t of these medications can be increased suicidal thoughts. On the surface that seems outlandish but it makes sense because those medications are balancing your brain chemistry. If it gets outta whack then so will you. \n\n\nI\u2019m older now, I had ADHD as a kid, I went to college and have a masters in psychology. I know all too well what you\u2019re going through. \n\nAlso know it\u2019s okay to tell your doctor you\u2019re not comfortable. I find a lot of people in psychology and medical have a bad case of thinking they\u2019re smarter than they are. You know you better than they ever will, so you need to be honest and open with your doctor about what is and isn\u2019t working and why or why not you feel a certain way. If they won\u2019t listen then you go to a new doctor.",

They're not MDs and don't have privileges or powers to medicate patients. I'd speak to your GP and ask if he would he willing to continue your ADHD med prescriptions as ADHD doesn't just affect concentration but abiltiy to prioritise tasks and function in society.\n\nI had issues getting a psych referral to get an ADD diagnosis and meds in the UK as an adult because I wasn't diagnosed as a kid and found that high dose stimulant pre-workouts helped me to cope better day to day. But ritalin gave all of the focus benefits without the palpitations and resting heart rate in the 120-130s.",

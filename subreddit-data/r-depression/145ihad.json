            "comment": "Depression is such a complicated thing to explain to people, especially since everyone who for sure has it and at a severe level, experiences it differently. Depression will always be a silent killer, they don\u2019t call it that for nothing. I know when you do get to that point, when S is on your mind, it brings a tiny bit of relief that you yourself won\u2019t be suffering anymore. People will always say just tell someone, go see a therapist, do this or do that, but depression is simply your mind and body in separation. Your mind may want to do things, or may know better, it talks. On the other hand, your body weighs like a corpse and won\u2019t move, drags around, gives out. Your mind and body are just disconnected and not communicating. And when you\u2019re stuck\u2026you are stuck. It IS debilitating, soul crushing, emotionally and physically draining, and you suffer from severe loss of interest in everything you love, and some people will never understand why dying or thinking of it just comes so easy. Depression doesn\u2019t always have a root cause, in fact most of the time it doesn\u2019t. You either have it or you don\u2019t.",

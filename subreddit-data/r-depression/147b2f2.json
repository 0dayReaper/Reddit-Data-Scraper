    "postText": "I lost my job 3 weeks ago and while I'm starting a new one in a few days I had the option to withdrawl all my 401k from my last job (like 1800). While I paid my bills for the next month I've been impulsively spending it on food and stupid shit I really don't need. \nThe last 2 days I've been feeling really depressed and passively suicidal and I impulsively bought a pack of pokemon cards literally 3 days ago and since I got a fucking full art holo I've spend a good 200 on booster packs since then. \nThis brings me back in my mind to every time I've lost my job or have been stupid depressed or suicidal to I literally go to spend all my money and have left myself in debt or losing a car/apartment/ having to donate plasma to pay bills. \nWhyyyyy do I do this? Does anyone else do this? \nI think losing a job I've held for 10 months isn't what made me depressed but losing my health insurance which made me have to get rid of my trauma therapist is what's fucking me up mentally. Lol.\n\n\nEdit: I don't even like pokemon like that anymore as an adult I just am operating on full obsessive compulsive/ gambling addiction I think.",

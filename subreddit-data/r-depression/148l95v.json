    "postText": "My life was amazing till 9th grade. I grew up with everything I wanted. Loving parents, tons of friends, birthday parties, semi big house. I was so hopeful and motivated.\n\nThen my nose became big in the 8th grade and I noticed people started acting weird towards me. My friends grew apart and when I would hang out with them I could tell they thought I was ugly.\n\nId get made fun of sometimes. I went from  super popular to ignored ugly kid within a year or 2\n\nI lost my mind. I screamed, cried tears for hours. My mom caved in and got me a nose job.\n\nFirst one botched, second one fixed it kinda.\n\nI\u2019m still ugly and I\u2019ve been on meth for 2 years. I lost my life savings and had 40k debt from trading stocks. I filed bankruptcy so I\u2019m good now.\n\nBut I\u2019ve lost the will to try anymore. I\u2019m not happy. I\u2019m sleep deprived severely. My fingers are numb and stiff. My body is malnourished and brittle.\n\nI just smoke meth and watch porn every single day. I don\u2019t want to work. I want the suffering to end.\n\nI don\u2019t recognize myself anymore and my parents are depressed. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. I hope I\u2019m in a nightmare.",

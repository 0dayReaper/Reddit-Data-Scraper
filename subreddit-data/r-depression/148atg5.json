    "postText": "Trying to finalize details is harder than I ever expected. I have been overwhelmed by emotion, which has only been overshadowed by determination. \n\nToday I spent nine hours completely off the grid (i.e., no cell phone, no contact), looking for the 'right' spot - somewhere peaceful &amp; where I will not traumatize anyone. I explored the forest, which was beautiful, and I even marked one spot with a potential 'X'. However, I think I prefer the shore at sunrise. I have always loved the beach, and sunrise is such a peaceful and wonderful time - it unequivocally offers the potential of a new beginning, regardless of the events from the day before.\n\nWhen I thought I found the perfect spot, along a desolate shore, the skies opened up and heavy rain poured down. Just then, a sea turtle emerged from the dune grass and waddled with determination across the beach into the ocean - right in front of me. Turtles carry deep meaning for me - maybe it was one of my loved ones leading the way? Or perhaps, in opposition, it was a sign of hope? (Given my current state of mind, probably not.)\n\nMy adult children know something is amiss, and they have asked if I am ok. I told them 'not really', and I was met with indifference (absolutely NOT their fault). They are focused and successful - traits I hope I helped instill. I love them SO much and I am SO extremely proud of them for that. I also reached out to my dad and my best friend (not candidly), who both have been checking-in (thank you &amp; I love you \u2764\ufe0f). \n\nI have tried multiple times to open up to my partner of 10+ years - trying to 'say it' without actually 'saying it'. This subject matter is not new to him by any means, and we have both lost colleagues/family members in this manner. However, he deals with so much actual/physical/psychological stress on a day-to-day basis, I think he *HAS* to see the ghost of what is left of me, instead of acknowledging/recognizing what I have become. I feel like I have become a relic of his peripheral vision - someone who used to exist. His bandwidth has been superceded. When I went off the grid today, he got angry and defensive. He packed-up and left for the rest of the week, shortly after I returned. Now I am alone... again. This actually makes it easier. I think I may intentionally push him away because I love him *SO* much and want to protect him. My love, please don't ever blame yourself - this was pre-ordained.\n\nI am in *INTENSE* pain - I do not know how else to describe it. I am like a chameleon - I am such an expert at hiding my suffering that, unfortunately, no one actually sees it. Regardless, I still, and ALWAYS will love you ALL for loving me. \u2764\ufe0f \n\nMost of you know, that from a very early age, my life has been filled with trauma and pain. I hoped that I could one day translate those experiences into something that would help save others. It seems that was not meant to be, and I have completely come to accept that - not everyone was meant to be impactful or remembered. Some of us must go gentle into that good night...\n\nI also recently came to realize (and accept) that my mom is in the process of dying a slow and torturous death. The accumulation of suffering in this life has been relentless and suffocating. I am too tired to continue to fight for survival. I am willing and ready for the ocean to swallow me up like in Bradbury's, \"The Women.\"\n\nI am haunted by the ghosts of my past - those that abused me, those that have hurt me, those that I have hurt, as well as those that I tried to save but failed. I love and appreciate all who tirelessly remained by my side - you know who are. \u2764\ufe0f Perhaps in another life things may have been different.\n\nAs Longfellow said, \n\"My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;\nIt rains, and the wind is never weary;\nMy thoughts still cling to the mouldering Past, but the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast, and the days are dark and dreary.\"\n\nI am not really needed by anyone anymore, and I can actually leave my  children in a decent financial position. I am one of those m-fers who probably seem to 'have it all'. Ironic, right? I always showed up 'happy' to events, fundraisers, and cook-outs; all the while ignoring the painful lump in my throat caused by the haunting thought of the inevitable. \n\nNo one seems to understand the impact of the breadth and depth of my life experiences. This insidious accumulation of events has become heavier and more magnified as I have gotten older (I am in my mid-40s). That is the thing about responding to death and destruction for a living, you get good at compartmentalizing, until one day -  unexpectedly - a box on the shelf starts to overflow. Once that happens, the crack in the dam can no longer be contained.\n\nI have a deep gratitude and appreciation for the perspective I have gained as a result of my life experiences - both good and bad. I have had some of the highest highs and the lowest lows; I have been fortunate to travel extensively including 5 out of the 7 continents (or 8, who's counting?), lots of countries, food, and culture; I have loved deeply and yet I have been wounded to the core - both by what I have experienced and what I have seen on the job.\n\nNo matter what, I want to minimize the trauma, impact, and recovery when the time comes - especially for my family, the firefighters/paramedics (since I am one), and other first responders - I know how vicarious trauma can linger. Thank you for your efforts and respect - please know there is nothing more you could have done. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI still have a lot of affairs to get in order - I hope I have time to complete them all. Then it will be time to have a final farewell celebration at sunrise. I just want to figure out the cleanest, least painful, and most elegant/efficient way to depart this plane. I have family and co-workers who have chosen this path prior, and it was all very messy. I know it will not be easy, but maybe I can make it less difficult for everyone involved.\n\nI wish I could just disappear (believe me, I  have tried - including today), but unfortunately I am not a magician. I am still working on the details while life continues to go on seemlessly around me - just as it did before, and as it will after. \n\nThank you for your time, prayers (if offered), and remembrance. Please take care of your family &amp; first responders and, if it comes to this, please try to understand and not judge... It has been a beautiful life... \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nIf we shadows have offended, \nThink but this, and all is mended, \nThat you have but slumber'd here \nWhile these visions did appear. (Shakespeare)",

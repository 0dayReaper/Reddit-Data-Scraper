Never thought I'd stoop to this level of pettiness in my life but here I am.\n\nPorn spark these intense feelings even more when I stumble on it. I tried to avoid porn best I can but it always gets shoved and shoveled on my face.\n\nI guess I feel that way because I know I'll never be able to have something remotely close and intimate like it. \n\nCan anyone going through the same thing I'm going through share what helped pacify these feelings?",

    "postText": "Ive been trying so hard to be able to feel better, and to not want to die anymore. Ive tried putting myself out there, talking more with people, getting help with school. Im trying so hard to look towards the future but everything sucks. And there isnt any way around the evil systems of the world. Ive been taking care of myself. cleaning my room, ive even gotten really reallly involved into my therapy to figure out what i can do to actually help myself and nothing works. i talk when im upset, i have great support systems, i talk when i need to through my issues, i even have a boyfriend that ive been dating for a year next month. I still feel unfulfilled. No one understands anything i talk about, any way i feel. I feel so alone. Nothing ive done in therapy has helped me feel better, just function more as a person. I still constantly think about ways i will commit. i feel so done with everything. I cant handle anything anymore. I cant get a job, no one ever wants to hangout with me, Ive created friends in my head that i talk to to feel less alone. Because everybody sucks. Everything is so unbareable i just sleep all day, i can barely make it to school. i cant complete any of my assignments, so even if i wanted to go to college there would be no point. Ive felt stuck for so long and have been trying trying TRYING so hard. so hard. But i always have nothing to offer, and no reasons. \nim going out of the country for the first time next month, im gonna be gone for three weeks. So i wont have any of my support systems back home. i wont have anything i know, ill be on a diffrent medication and surrounded by people i dont know if ill have anything in common with and im terrified. Im terrified of living, every second i look into the future all i see is failure. I have nothing to offer. im sorry for ranting. im so depressed and whenever i talk about suicide its always the same thing over and over and over again. And no one ever actually tries. Im sorry",

Really? Do you really not want to?\n\nWhat is pushing through?  Can I recharacterize that? Is it taking what is mine?\n\nI seem to have an underlying belief that life should not be difficult\n\nI don't want to be an adult\n\nIts like I think this is going to get me where I want to go\n\nWhy do I not want to be an adult?\n\nBecause I have no fun in my life and have not had and there is \"no\" prospect for it\n\nI don't want to put pressure on myself I've had enough of that\n\nI don't want to put myself where I could be rejected I've had enough of that\n\nI've had enough\n\nCan I put this aside and do something useful?\n\nIf I've had enough can't that be turned around into a good thing?\n\nWhat have I had enough of really?\n\nEnough of a good life? No\n\nEnough fun? No\n\nEnough of feeling bad, regardless of reason? Yes\n\nEnough of beating myself up? Yes\n\nEnough of bad / immature communication with parents? Yes\n\nEnough of thinking I'm not enough, don't have enough? Yes\n\nEnough of worrying? Yes\n\nEnough of feeling I'm fat and not strong enough? Yes\n\nEnough time feeling lonely? Yes\n\n\n(this is where I got to, surprisingly this stream of consciousness turned around into something positive... gonna keep going on it but this is what I have now)",

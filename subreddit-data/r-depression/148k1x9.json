    "postText": "i go through periods of just disconnection from reality, and just a true sense of not being there and not needing anyone. it\u2019s been maybe 2 years since i\u2019d last had this feeling and i thought maybe it had gone away, but over the past few weeks i\u2019ve found myself not happy, and overall just empty. disconnected from a lot of my friends whom i used to talk to almost everyday has gone to maybe once a week at the very best. when i\u2019m actually doing something i enjoy this goes away, i went to a festival with a couple mates and loved it, but it\u2019s tough to have the motivation 99% of the time. \n\ni hate feeling like this cos of the pain i\u2019m worried it\u2019s causing on my girlfriend of 10 months, i love her and i know i do but i\u2019m emotionally cut off during these periods, and i feel like i\u2019m drifting and i don\u2019t know how to stop it. i don\u2019t want to hurt her but i don\u2019t know what to do",

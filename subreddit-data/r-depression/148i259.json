I\u2019ve explained to everyone I\u2019m not the same at the moment and I\u2019m going through a rough time. My best friend has called me weird, my dad has called me disrespectful and my mum has told me she\u2019s embarrassed of me because I can\u2019t bring my self to get out of bed. I just want some advice or to be told someone understands what I\u2019m going through because I just feel alone at the moment.",

            "comment": "Depression and anxiety are difficult to process without a support system. Normally family and friends are supposed to be that. \n\nI would suggest finding a qualified therapist that can be supportive and offer ways to help process your feelings of depression and anxiety. A good first step is understanding the root of why you feel this way and what could help in coping with those feelings.\n\nAs well I know we can't choose our families, though we can choose our friends. Try to surround yourself with supportive people in real life that don't judge you at your lowest. It's important to find lifelong understanding people in your support network.\n\nI know from personal experience from when I was in high school, my best friend's mother had an unhealthy jealousy of her own daughter which caused her to consistently insult her body image to the point my best friend developed an eating disorder. I know without our friend group supporting her, it would have gotten a lot worse.\n\nSo try to take the first step to get help and understand why you feel the way you do and process them through a supportive therapist. Then open up to your friend once you have a better understanding of why you feel this way.\n\nIf your best friend still judges you after opening up, then that's not a supportive best friend. I would find more supportive people to grow with. I hope this helps.",

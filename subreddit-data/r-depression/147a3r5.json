But those feelings are temporary. \nYou\u2019re going to be okay.\nSometimes you honestly have to ride it out. \nWhat I say to myself is \u201cwhat goes up, must come down\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s with depression too. I have low days but I know I\u2019ll feel okay soon.\n\nDo things that help make you happy. Drawing, reading, long walks. Do something you don\u2019t normally do to give your mind a little boost.\n\nMake sure to always reach out to loved ones. You are loved.",

    "postText": "Another day, another person telling me to kill myself. I want to end it, I know I\u2019m worthless but hey, I\u2019ll fail and just waste some doctors valuable time, just kill me yourself if it\u2019s that important to you. I hate being trans, I hate not having a family, I hate that every single day I have to deal with hate from random strangers. It\u2019s not like I get a break from it, the same assholes protest outside the library beside my grocery store. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, I want to end it more than anything, I know I don\u2019t belong here, nobody wants me here, and those who do are only burdened by my existence. Now I live in a world dominated by conspiracies and religious whack jobs who want to eradicate me because I am the way I am, something I never fucking wanted in the first place. I\u2019m just trying to get by, I suck at fucking everything, I\u2019m a horrible person and nobody wants me here. I\u2019m better off dead.\n\nHey, next person to tell me to kill myself, your preaching to the choir. Your just another in a very long list of people who can\u2019t stand me, and when I die, hopefully that will bring you some joy. That will be my only contribution to this world, killing me will be the most important/best thing I ever do with my life.",

Don\u2019t worry about the world and the big plans or the religions or conspiracy. Worry about yourself.  Worry about enjoy the little time you have on this pale blue dot. You won\u2019t get it again. Just let go of it all and flow. It\u2019s much easier.",

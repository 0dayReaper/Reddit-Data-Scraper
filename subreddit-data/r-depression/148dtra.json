My family has had it rough the past couple of years with people dying or getting sick and some other stuff. It\u2019s something we are still going through. It\u2019s definitely hard to say the least and Ive definitely gotten the existential anger at the world or god or life in general.  I don\u2019t have any big words of wisdom for you but just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry for whatever you are going through.",

Find another place to live, and forget about their existence. I risk being homeless in a couple of years but I prefer this end than to deal with problems and drama I never created.",

I end up just crying for an hour or three. I'll then beg God to let me sleep forever as I literally can do nothing, I'm not equipped for this world. So what is God's response? He gave me a car that I needed but can't afford the payments. I've tried bargaining with Him to exchange the car for the forever sleep. Please God, maybe you're reading this comment? Maybe you'll read the MANY MANY other disheartening posts and comments too? Then actually help us?",

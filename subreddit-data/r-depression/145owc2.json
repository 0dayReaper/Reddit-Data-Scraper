I don\u2019t want to live anymore the only reason I\u2019m still alive is because I\u2019m to much of a coward. I would have stabbed myself in the neck a long time ago but I\u2019m to afraid that I\u2019ll survive.\n\nI just want this to stop I want my life to just end I don\u2019t care how as long as I\u2019m dead. I don\u2019t have any hope I will never be happy or okay ever again.\n\nI just need this to end.",

It\u2019s okay if you go back steps or stumble. Life isn\u2019t about getting to your goal. It\u2019s about just trying. It\u2019s going to be okay. I love you very much.",

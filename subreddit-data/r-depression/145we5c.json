Yesterday was nothing but good news for me, job promotion, new car, had a great night celebrating with my parents(no alcohol involved). Yet I still have vivid nightmares every night. I do meditate before bed. I don\u2019t eat for hours before bed. It\u2019s an every night occurrence and it\u2019s effecting my mood in the day. Even on medications the dreams would become more intense for me. I\u2019m kinda at the point where this is just something I have to accept in life, which depresses tf out of me. Has anyone else experienced this and found a niche that helped you to overcome this? All advice accepted.",

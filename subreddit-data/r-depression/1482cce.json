    "postText": "TW: SA\n\nI haven't had the worst life in the world. Others have had it worse. But, my life has been filled with trauma and only etched with small slivers of happiness. I have never felt true peace anywhere I've lived.\n\nI grew up with an abusive father and a mother that just sat back and let it happen. I moved out because I was desperate and lived with my partner who quicky became verbally, physically, emotionally and sexually abusive. I was raped. Then, I moved in with a friend who, six months into it, got a traumatic brain injury and suffered some brain damage. I was her full blown caretaker (while also holding a full time job) because I cared about her. Then, she had a mental break and said the most abhorrent things to me to my face, often saying that what I told her about my relationship was a lie and I was just like my ex. She said I was an evil person and did nothing for her. She kicked me out and I had a week to find a new place to live. So, I started renting a room from a friend who could only keep me there for eight months.\n\nI have three weeks before I'm moving in with another friend. But the housing market is so fucked that we can't find a place to live. He has a stable job and a month to month apartment. I don't.\n\nI'm autistic, heavily traumatized and barely able to hold down a job. I'm only 24. I feel like I'm bending under so much pressure that, if I'm not extremely careful, I'm going to snap in half. It literally feels like my heart is a heavy, ticking time bomb waiting to explode at any moment.\n\nEvery time I try to talk to someone about it, they say \"life is stressful, that's just the way it is. We just have to keep pushing through.\"\n\n...Does everyone feel this way? Is everyone under so much stress that they feel like their heart might explode and they'll just fall over and die?\n\nAm I just too weak to handle it?",

Some people haven't had been through this situation and they say what they think is the best because they don't exactly know what's better. Having shelter is a huge problem in today's world considering the population and generally how accommodation works right now. But the fact that you're trying is what matters. Doesn't matter if you can't keep jobs, doesn't matter if you can't stay at one place more than a short duration, what matters is you're doing what you're doing by yourself and with no support and most of all you're still trying. I'm not saying that you'll be just fine, but you may be stronger than you think. The day you beat the system, you'll look back at this day and think about how far you came.  \n\n\nAll the best bud!  \n(Also, please consider a therapist.)",

All I want is to finally build a life somewhere, get a therapist and try to finally be at fucking peace.\n\nBut I appreciate the support. It genuinely means a lot.",

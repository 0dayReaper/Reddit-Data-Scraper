    "postText": "So, I just came out of a major depressive episode, I am better now but my room is a mess. Does anyone have tip and tricks on how to start cleaning this up because I get overwhelmed looking at it and trying to get myself to clean it up. I have been good at making sure there is no food or dirty clothes that can rot/make the place smell but you can't even see the floor",

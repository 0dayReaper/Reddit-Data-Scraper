Deep down I don\u2019t want to die but it\u2019s my only option I can\u2019t tell anyone. All I do is wake up then cry that I\u2019m still alive and then say hi to my cat then go back to sleep hoping I don\u2019t wake up. I hate this why can\u2019t I just die already I don\u2019t matter I promise you all I don\u2019t I don\u2019t and I never will.",

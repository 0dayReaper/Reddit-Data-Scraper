    "postText": "Hi so I dont know how to start. (Im 16 year old if that's important)\n\nLately I have been feeling numb? But i think that's a wrong Word to describe it.\n\ni cant feel physical pain, i mean it does hurt but it doesnt at the same time its tickls for me, but that's not all i cannot cry. I dont Rember the last time i cried just becasue i felt bad i can cry if sometimes makes me tear up like a movie but i cannot cry even if i have a worst breakdown i have in months, instead of crying i catch myself laughing somtimes actually.\n\nIm some sytuation i dont feel anything, i remeber when a old guy was touching my ass without contest i didnt react in any way, the only thing i did took his hand away but he took it back to my ass and contiue, i didnt do anything again until he didnt stop himself, much later i felt disgusted with myself cuz i didnt do anything. My point is i often dont feel anything in bad sytuation until much later and that's disgust or anger most of the time.\n\nOften i feel what some people call buterflies but I have sometning i like to call moths cuz i have this feeling thats trying to at the same time eat me Alive and that tries to leave my body at the same time, and well it just feels like moths. I feel it quiet often in bad sytuation, so i either feel that or nothing\n\nIm sorry if this doesnt make much sens but that's the best i can describe it",

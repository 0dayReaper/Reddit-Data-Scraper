    "postText": "I've been feeling so overwhelmed lately. \n\nI just graduated the only school I've ever been to, and now I'm getting ready for high school. One of my friends is going to a different school, and I'll rarely ever see her anymore.\n\nI don't like myself, and now my mom is telling me I'll most likely be getting braces over the summer.\n\nMy whole life, I've had to play the part of this happy little girl. Sometimes I can convince myself that I am that girl. But as soon as I'm alone, it all fades away.\n\nThere's no reason why I should feel this way. I've never been bullied, my parents and friends all love me (though I don't know why, I don't deserve it), and I've always done well in school.\n\nI can't go to my parents, because they wouldn't understand. They'd give me a whole lecture about how I should love myself the way God loves me. They say they know all about me. Oh, how wrong they are. \n\nI could go to my friends, but I'm scared to tell them. They're so good to me and I don't want to burden them with my problems. \n\nSo, instead, I'm writing this. I just need to get all this off my chest. I've been living like this for almost my whole life, and...I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. I've thought about ending it all, but I can't do that to my family. Something has to change, and soon. I just don't know if I have the strength to make that change. \n\nI could really use some encouraging words right now.",

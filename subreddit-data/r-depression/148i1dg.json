    "postText": "I don't feel comfortable sharing this to my IRLs but I thought that now I've scored a job I'd feel better, but I don't. I haven't been able to get myself to eat properly, partially bc I don't have the money to provide food for myself and my boyfriend, so that adds so much more pressure to my mind. I haven't been able to fully relax lately. It's like my heartbeat is constantly on race mode to the point where it's hard to focus. I miss being a kid and not having all this shit to worry about. I'm fuckin in debt and not at all financially stable enough to pay them off, to even pay rent to my boyfriend's parents. I don't even know if I'll be able to pay my half of our phone bill this month. I haven't felt like myself in months. I think I've been dissociating for the past couple months, completely moving on autopilot. I miss my dad, so much. I wish he wasn't dead so I could just cry to him. That's all I want to do lately is just cry. Im just so fucking tired. I'm so close to my breaking point. I sometimes think of checking myself in somewhere but I don't wanna get stuck with bills after. Idk anymore. I'm not happy with life, I'm not happy with myself. I don't even know where I'll be in five years. I don't think I'll make it that far. The only thing keeping me here is my cat and not wanting to destroy my mom and bf if I did decide to unborn myself",

    "postText": "Another day of chronic depression and anxiety. Morning medication makes me feel somewhat great until 3pm when it\u2019s affects slowly start to fade away and my empty reality is left raw. The scope of the negative and intrusive thoughts is so large it\u2019s now my state of being. I don\u2019t know how to escape it. \n\n\u201cHey, how are you feeling\u201d? \n\u201cPretty depressed tbh hbu\u201d\u2026 \n\u201cWhy, what\u2019s wrong\u201d? \n\nI\u2019ll let you know when anything feels right. My state of being feels wrong; don\u2019t you understand? I\u2019ll be happily surprised when a day comes and I don\u2019t want to be unalived. Suicidal is my state of being. I never want to be here. I have to be here. I\u2019m not grateful to have been born. I don\u2019t want to be here. Don\u2019t you understand? And no please don\u2019t call the police on me, that will only make it worse. \n\nI am here and alive so I will make the best out of it. 29 years later and I\u2019m at a low mental state. My chronic mental illness qualifies me to receive disability benefits. After waiting 3 years, I\u2019m now collecting but my mental health is at the lowest it\u2019s ever been. I am grateful to live in a country where disability is offered to me but my days are purposeless. I cannot live a life where I wakeup in the morning and have not achieved anything in the past and am not working towards anything for my future. It\u2019s driving my insane. \n\nI am single, I went to school for photography but moved to North Carolina after a breakup with an abusive ex boyfriend. Photography is not an industry here and I have felt incredibly out of place living here. I\u2019ve made no close friends and been on tons of dates with not one being of any success. I smoke 420 and it\u2019s just not the thing here. People here enjoy breweries and bar hopping. No. Just no. \n\nI\u2019m posting this on here because it\u2019s looked down on to share how you feel on most platforms. I don\u2019t want my family to be upset or look like I\u2019m searching for attention. I am lonely. I don\u2019t want to feel sad and hopeless all of the time, but I feel so alone and I can\u2019t do this life alone. I\u2019m posting on here so if someone reads this they feel less alone because I know how horrible that feeling is.",

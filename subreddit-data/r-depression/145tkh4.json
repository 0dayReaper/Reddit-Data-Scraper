    "postText": "I've been experiencing serious depression for the past 2 months, and I'm really tired of it. Life feels really hard these days, and everything in life takes a lot of energy, even the most simple tasks.\n\nHere's a list of my symptoms:\n\n* No pleasure or enjoyment in anything (the only exception is eating)\n* Socializing is very hard, and when I do socialize, I have nothing to talk about (my mind feels blank and numb)\n* Very hard to hold a conversation with others (my mind goes blank very quickly)\n* Waking up everyday and getting out of bed feels very hard\n* Speaking to family members on the phone is hard (I'm pretty mute)\n* Doing any tasks, or work around the house is very hard\n* I don't have any emotions, and trying to smile and be friendly to strangers come off weird and fake\n* No motivation for anything\n* Very shy\n* Very fatigued\n\nBasically it feels like I'm wearing a lead jacket 24/7. Everything takes a lot of energy, and life is just draining. I left my job in software recently because I struggled to think and perform my job anymore, so I had no choice but to leave. I'm now doing Uber, but even that takes a lot of energy, because trying to be friendly and have conversations with riders takes a lot out of me.\n\nI have also been on Lexapro 20mg for the past 3 years, but I don't feel that they're helping at all with my depression, and I've also been seeing a therapist for 3 years, which is good, but I feel like I need extra help right now in my life.\n\nI've read books, blogs, and other websites on depression and have tried it all (exercise, diet, socializing, sleep, routine), but it seems all of these things aren't helping me. Has anyone else felt like this, and can help me get out of it please? I just want to feel like a normal human being again, and enjoy my life. I feel like I'm trapped in a mental prison right now, and the chances of being free feel slim. I'm usually an extremely outgoing person, with a lot of confidence and charisma, but for the past 2 months, I feel like a completely different person. Right now I would do anything to have a clear mind, and to feel normal again.\n\nTo give some background to how I feel like I got here, the following things happened in the past 6 months:\n\n* I was dating a girl for 3 months and she broke up with me out of nowhere (I really loved her a lot, and we built a strong connection together in the short period of time we were together)\n* After the girl broke up with me, I slept with as many girls as possible because it felt like the right thing to do and it was exciting at the time (now I question if this was me avoiding the difficult feelings from the breakup)\n* Now if I even try to get close to another girl, I get very anxious and flee as fast as possible (I'm guessing my subconscious mind is scared to get hurt again)\n* I've have a past with anxiety, but I've managed to keep it at bay for the past year or so, and understand how to deal with it. But I've never experienced depression anything remotely close to this\n\nIf anyone has gone through anything like this that I'm experiencing, please share your experiences, thoughts, and what has worked for you. At this point I am open to trying anything that will help.\n\nThank you.",

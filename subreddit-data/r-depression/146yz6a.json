    "postText": "In 2019 I lost my daughter to alcoholism.  She told me she couldn't ever live being sober. She was with the same guy 25 years and raised a son. He is 22 now. We lived 1400 miles apart so we FaceTimed a lot. The last days were horrific. She refused all medical care and just decided to go cold turkey off alcohol. She lasted 4 days. Her face was huge from her liver shutting down. She tried convincing me she was eating too much salt. I did 7 well-being checks over a 3 year period but I Wisconsin there is no law against being drunk and drinking your self to death. I couldn't get her sectioned so long story short. Her son went home from work and found her. She died on her father's birthday who died 4 years prior. There's lots of unanswered questions about this whole thing. The boyfriend of 25 years was never a drug user. Ever. But after my daughter died he found another girlfriend and she found me through Facebook. She said he was abusive. Sent me videos and pictures with bruises on her. On New Year's Eve day she passed too. She was also a drinker. But was only 31. So I took all my pictures and videos she sent me and called police. They said they had been to their house 12 times in the last year. But cops always sided with him because she was drunk. My daughter never called cops. Was she covering for him? Idk. The girlfriend and I grew close over the year I knew her. She had a big mouth. Told me all about him. If I could post pictures here you'd see the same exact thing happened to them both. Cops say, not enough evidence. When the second girl died, she had a cracked skull and brain bleed. I don't know. Any thoughts. This might not be the right sub for this but it just came flowing out. It's the cause of my depression and anxiety.",

            "comment": "I understand you wanting to place blame somewhere else for your daughters death. But going cold turkey as a sever alcoholic can have deadly consequences. You said her face was all blown up at the end. From the details provided it sounds like it was from the alcohol. This may sound cold but please focus on grieving your daughter. Don\u2019t create more grief for yourself by wondering what if. This will only make it worse you can\u2019t go and bring her back. Regardless of the accusation. I would focus on healing.",

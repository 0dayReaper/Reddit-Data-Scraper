    "postText": "My 17th birthday was a little more than a month ago. I\u2019m applying to college next year. I feel absolutely directionless. I don\u2019t want to apply to college because it doesn\u2019t feel real that I made it to this point. I\u2019ve thought for a long time that I would be dead by now. I thought that my mom\u2019s cancer diagnosis would push me over the edge. I thought that it would have been lockdown. I thought getting sexually assaulted would have been the last straw. I thought school would have gotten too hard. \n\nI\u2019m convinced that getting rejected from my top schools because of what my depression turned me into will be the actual last thing.\n\nYears of fighting this meant I have almost nothing to show from high school comparative to my peers. It might seem silly for me to say this because I\u2019m actually doing fairly well in school, but for my school specifically, I\u2019m in poor standing. I wasn\u2019t able to get myself to participate in anything until this year, and my grades were okay, but never anything special. I did what I could. But I blew my chance at all of my top schools. \n\nI feel like a failure. I regret not making the most of high school, not only because of this, but also because it\u2019s almost over and I have very few memories to leave with. \n\nThe worst part is that it isn\u2019t getting any better. Just because I didn\u2019t end my life when I thought I would doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t still think I\u2019ll do it eventually. I\u2019m just not sure whether I\u2019ll be 18, 20, 25, 30, whatever. I\u2019ve just always accepted that it was going to happen. In my mind, I was never supposed to live out my entire life expectancy. I had to talk to my girlfriend of 3 years yesterday about how, if we stay together through college (unlikely, I know), that she will likely have to live through my s**cide. \n\nNo matter how I think of my future, I always see it ending the same way: abruptly, and by my own hands. I\u2019m beginning to pray for an accident.",

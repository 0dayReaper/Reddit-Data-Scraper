    "postText": "English is not my first language. sorry in advance.\n\nI've never been a particularly enthusiastic person, but this past year I've felt especially unmotivated. It's not a constant feeling of sadness, but rather, i feel...emotional numbness?. Nothing gets me going, nothing gets me excited. Episodes of sadness overwhelm me, and moments of happiness have become so brief; it feels like I can't enjoy life anymore.\n\nI've stopped going to the gym, i've lost my appetite, and I'm rapidly losing weight. I can't even keep up with college. I'm so stressed out, but no matter how much I try, I can't seem to get it together. I just can't.\n\nI've become really isolated, and even though I want to socialize more, I've found comfort in being alone, even though I know it's self-destructive behavior. I've been canceling so many plans in the past few months because I'd rather stay at home.\n\nSometimes it feels like im overreacting. I keep thinking \"maybe i'm just on my period\" \"maybe i'm just tired\" \"i'm just being lazy\".\n\nI've tried to schedule appointments with psychiatrists, but I always end up canceling last minute, because I keep thinking this is a problem I can solve on my own. I don't know how to break free from this cycle.",

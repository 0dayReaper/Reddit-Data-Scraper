    "postText": "I (21M) am suffering from anxiety and depression for almost about 4 years now. I started college when   I was 19 and I am in my 2nd year of college now. Things happened in my life that did a number on my self esteem and confidence. I stopped doing the thing I enjoyed and have coping mechanism such as porn, smoking, eating unhealthy food, being in front of screen for long time. \n\nBecause of all of this I was unable to focus on studies and failed a bunch of exams in my 2nd semester.\n\nWhen my parents found out about it I got scolded by them but they gave me a chance todo better but they didn't know that because of my anxiety I wasn't attending classes for my 3rd semester and wasn't allowed in exams. I repeated the same thing and didn't attend 4th semester classes either because thinking about how much backlog  I have I used to get anxiety attacks. \n\nIn a few days my parents will find out about this and I just don't have the power to face them or tell them the truth about what is happening to me.\n\nI am not a good son, for the past few years all I have done is wasted their money and gave them nothing else but shame.\n\nI want to kill myself but I am ashamed about what people would say behind their backs about me. I will probably get in front of a car or truck so that they think it was an accident, atleast they don't have to feel any shame regarding me.\n\nI wish there was a way out of this.",

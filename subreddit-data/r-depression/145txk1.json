    "postText": "Maybe then I could actually live. Like a ghost, sure, but free.\n\nIt feels like I meet people just to distance myself eventually. Once I meet someone, I'm already planning ways to slowly fade out of the picture. Someone told me once that even while talking, it's like I'm not there.\n\nI haven't felt present in a while. I wish I wasn't here, but still, some parts of the world are beautiful. I wish I could just be a spectator instead.\n\nI also wish I wasn't me, I think the hardest part of living for me has been myself and the fact that I'm who I'm stuck with. I leave any potential connection for two reasons, because I'm scared of them hurting me and of me hurting them.\n\nI just wish I was someone else.",

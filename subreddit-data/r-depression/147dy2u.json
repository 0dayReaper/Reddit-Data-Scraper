    "postText": "I feel hopeless. I don't see any strong connection for me I know my mom loves me and I feel so broken inside cause that's not enough i don't know if someone will ever fulfill the black hole it's not only a problem of loneliness i have a lot of trauma coming to me when I try to sleep early. I don't see a way out and sometimes I wonder what's the point of anything and I wanna cut my veins cause I'm not planning to live in this hole till I'm 50 or whatever. Even if I put my best effort i can't be sure if something Is going to change\nI know shit happened to me but that's all? I depend on my first 15 years of life to define how's gonna be next? I just wanna burn the trauma and built something that I would like to have. Nothing is fair.\n I worry if this how I'm always feel",

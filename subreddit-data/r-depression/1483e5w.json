    "postText": "Recently I\u2019ve been in love with this girl for the past year. I don\u2019t know how to get over her or stop thinking about her. I\u2019ve never been in a relationship before with her but she keeps coming back into my life talking to me for weeks then ghosting me for weeks. I just want to get over her and move on with my life. I know I may be too young to be in love but my life revolves around this girl. This has drove me to deep thoughts even thinking about doing the worst. I haven\u2019t told anyone or asked for any help about this but I\u2019m sick of just bottling these feelings up for the last year",

Your best bet is to cut her out of your life completely and focus on improving yourself so that the next time you feel this strongly about a girl you actually have a chance.",

There can be many reasons why someone comes and goes but it\u2019s unhealthy for you to obsess or try to spend too much time picking the reasons apart.\n\nIf she wants to come back into your life tell her she needs to communicate clearly with you, but it\u2019s more than likely she will not change if she has been doing this to you for more than a year now, therefore cutting contact and not allowing her back in will let you move forward and find others more deserving of your time",

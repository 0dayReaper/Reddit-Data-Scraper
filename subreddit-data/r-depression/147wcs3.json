    "postText": "I love them dearly and they did too but I felt closer to them as a friend than a partner. We\u2019ve had arguments. I\u2019ve tried communicating how they make me feel sometimes but nothing really changes and It becomes my fault when I want space from them \n\nThey had an episode late last year and we broke up and stayed friends but they became cold and distant to me but would still be around friends. Eventually we argued about how they were treating me poorly and essentially were just wanting me around to just ask for favors and i won\u2019t allow myself to be that. \n\nThey acknowledged how they treated me finally and apologized profusely and we haven\u2019t talked since. I text them once a month and they still have pictures of me on social media. I know she misses me and I just want to be there out of support while also focusing on myself more. I won\u2019t lie, it\u2019s been hard seeing some I care so deeply about lash out at me like that like they never have before. They had abandonment issues and I\u2019ve tried my best to reassure that I won\u2019t leave people I care for but I know that\u2019s hard for her to understand",

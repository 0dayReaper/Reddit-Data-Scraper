    "postText": "I've been going to therapy and taking different antidepressants for 15+ years.  Im 35 and Ive done nothing with my life. I work a warehouse job that is boring as hell and dread going to.  I know this is my fault, Im not learning new things, putting in the work, growing as a person and thats why my life is the way it is.  But then today I could barely manage to gather the motivation to do laundry.  Im suppose to clean my apartment and there was some issue with my lease I have totalk to my landlord about.  Tomorrow is my last day off and i keep procrastinating.\n\nIf I can hardly manage this basic life shit, how am I supposed to hold down a job other than unskilled menial work?  Im thinking my life is just a joke and im so embarrassed and ashamed of who I am.  Why should I keep living?\n\nI probably need a new therapist.  Therapy always ends the same; I dont do anything to make changes and I stay unhappy and find myself unmotivated to do anything about it, and if I try to do anything its the absolute bare minimum.  Im starting to thik therapy cant help me because im a broken piece of shit.",

    "postText": "I've tried, I really have. I just don't know what else to do.   \nI am 32 years old, and happiness only seems to get further out of reach with every passing day. In years prior, I told myself something would change, that there was hope, but with every one that passes, it only gets worse, no matter what I do.  \nMy whole life, I've never fit in anywhere. It's practically impossible for me to make friends. The few I had, have all moved on.  \nIf I go on dates, they never go anywhere. The only real relationship I've ever been in fell apart.  \nI end up spending most of my free time at home by myself where I can pretend the rest of the world doesnt exist. I force myself to go out, but I end up feeling even more alone than at home. Seeing all those people enjoying themselves, but somehow being unable to join them.  \nThere's nothing left that makes me happy. The most I can hope for is a distraction from the dread. Even those never last long.  \nI've been to therapy. I've even tried more unconventional methods like MDMA and LSD, all to no avail.  \nI don't know what else to do. Why is happiness always out of reach? Why does it seem so easy for everyone else?  \nI'm not looking for much, I just want to be normal. Why do I have to be like this? Why can't I just find someone, something, anything?  \nThere's no reason for me to carry on. I am disposable. What reason do I have to keep going? My cowardice is the only thing keeping me alive. I can not bring myself to die, but I have no interest in living.",

One of the main reasons that I avoid going for walks (im friendless) is that I can't stand anymore watching all those happy people hanging out and having a good time. I don't have any, but even if I had, my non-existent motivation would push them away or I would think it all day long, go out sometimes (when 1-2 friends who moved to another country, visit their relatives in my country and we hang out 1-2 times. I just can't get any joy! It's like a chore, past friend that has moved, come back to his country, he calls me to hangout I can't say no, when I was better years ago we had lots of fun together. That was almost a decade ago.",

It seems super easy for others to make friends and find their match and live fun and happy lives, but I fail miserably at that. I\u2019m also at home most of the time with my dog just getting through the days. When I do go out with friends, it\u2019s fun in the moment and then I get home and reality sets back in. You\u2019re not alone. I hope things get better for you soon!",

    "postText": "That's kind of it. I am utterly and completely a disappointment. I've struggled with suicidal depression since I was 17. It got better 6 years ago, and it was still bad. Since 2020 I've fought off and on with it. My closest family member died and now I feel like suicide is a good option for me. Every fiber of my being is worthless. I am the epitome of a piece of shit. I'm stupid, sad, ugly. So fucking sad. So apathetic. I ruminate over things that make me feel bad. I don't care about anything important. I've been this way to varying degrees my entire adult life. I got a new job, a more adult job, and I'm not excited. I still want to kill myself. I am inherently unlovable. I'm so easy to emotionally abuse. I can't stand the isolation and the pain. All I've done today is cry and sleep. I have to figure out the best way to kill myself.",

You deserve the consideration of another human being, you deserve so much more than that. You are human, you\u2019ve done good things that have helped people, you\u2019ve done bad things that have hurt people. You have emotions and a personality. You have your own unique story that nobody else can replicate. That makes you fucking special. That means that you deserve to have someone help you. You deserve help and love. You are not worthless. And I believe that things can get better for you. Please don\u2019t give up on yourself. I really truly believe that you are special and deserve to be loved and cared for.",

Depression magnifies insecurities and makes you think they are bigger and more real than they are. You are not a piece of shit, you just told me that you have friends. If you were a piece of shit you would not have friends. Fong let your insecurities destroy you.",

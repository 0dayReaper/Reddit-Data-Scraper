I\u2019m here at work as a janitor and thought about wrapping trash bags around my head to die hopefully. \n\nLife isn\u2019t worth living or at least mine isn\u2019t and I don\u2019t see much about regular life worth fighting for. \n\nI just want out. I want to be dead. Ever since my car accident when I got to walk away with no medical issues, I have just wanted and wishes I had died in it. \n\nI\u2019m 23, so many people say things get better, life gets better, your so young, and all of that but it doesn\u2019t matter one bit\u2026life is not worth it. \n\nPlease something take me out before I lose hope and do it myself",

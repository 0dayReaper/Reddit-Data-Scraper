    "postText": "I'm someone who likes to act like an idiot because it makes me laugh and it makes others laugh, both laughing and seeing others laugh makes me feel really happy. Unfortunately this often has a side effect of people thinking I'm stupid, and I've had people say really mean things about me in relation to that, but friends who I trust to see this side of me, I trust that they've gotten to know me well enough to know that I'm not and I am hurt by people saying things like that. Well, I just had someone who I thought was a friend refer to me as being mentally deficient. I've already been struggling with my depression lately and this was the last straw to bring the boulder down on my back.\n\nI don't understand why someone can't just have fun and be happy and not be seen as stupid. Why do we have to be serious or mean all the time in order to be taken seriously? Why can't people just let others be happy? I just want to laugh and have a good time to distract myself from my depression and depressive thoughts that are constantly looming over me and help keep myself from going into a downward spiral, why is that just so freaking bad, so \"stupid\" and \"immature\"? I guess I'll just crawl back into my depression hole and not talk to people for a week. Guess that will \"smarten\" me up, being miserable is so much smarter.",

If you want to become the biggest a-hole yourself, you can actually use this information to your advantage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Try to find a way to cheer up miserable people. \n* Be genuine - the joke is on them...\n* Take care of responsibilities, but play stupid.\n* Make fun of, and challenge how people perceive things.\n* And find out what makes a-holes really tick.\n\nYou might get punched in the face, loose all your friends - but it'll be great fun!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, you can balance it all out...\n\nGet kissed on the cheek, get lots of friends, and it'll still be great fun!\n\n  \nYou're probably like this because you're highly intelligent, and have experienced severe trauma. So you should look into that, and how you can heal.\n\nIt might be an idea to limit this dopamine to certain situations - so you live a more balanced life. Maybe get some Ritalin or find another extreme way to feel stimulated - like exercising.\n\nIf you don't focus on your future - no matter how funny it is being a clown - you'll feel left out and depressed. \n\nSometimes I laugh hysterically in total ecstasy for ten minutes over the smallest thing, and afterwards I cry into the endless pit that I call my emptiness, and feel all alone and ashamed.\n\nI think that how it feels like to have sex for normal people?\n\nAnyways, if you want to be a clown - then for your own sake, you should get a job as one - otherwise it may not be appreciated in the long run.\n\nBut who knows? There is a place in this hell, for comedians as well...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest wishes!",

Life isn't really like that, and people might be questioning if it's genuine or not. Not saying it is or isn't, but are you really doing all that because you actually want to laugh, or because you want a reaction and to be seen as someone who's having fun? It sounds more like the latter based on your first sentence.",

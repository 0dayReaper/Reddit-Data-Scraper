            "comment": "\"Sadness is a human emotion that all people feel at certain times during their lives. Feeling sad is a natural reaction to situations that cause emotional upset or pain. There are varying degrees of sadness. But like other emotions, sadness is temporary and fades with time. In this way, sadness differs from depression.\n\nDepression is a longer-term mental illness. It impairs social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning. Left untreated, symptoms of depression may last for a long time.\"\n\nReally, only trained professionals can diagnose you as being depressed. \n\nIs there absolutely zero reason why you're feeling sad? Has anything in your life changed? Are you feeling anxious or alone?",

Then, if the GP can't handle it, they'll probably refer you to a therapist first, then a psychiatrist. \n\nBut being a teen can be tough. Especially when going through puberty. Lots of emotions. Discovering who you are. A mix between wanting to be socially accepted and independent. \n\nI know I had a tough time as a teen. But I was diagnosed as bipolar at 16. And this wasn't until after several suicide attempts. It's funny how it works out like that.",

Do you usually stick to a fixed sleep schedule? Have any important activities coming up?\n\nBut I do believe anxiety can make you more sleepless. Getting less sleep can lead to more anxiety and a lack of energy and enthusiasm, which contributes to you feeling sad.",

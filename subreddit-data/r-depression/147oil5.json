    "postText": "Struggling to overcome corrections on my thesis now; same place (okay maybe 1 or two deleted paragraphs) I was at last week.\n\nCan\u2019t quit cause I wasted 7/8 years on this and will feel like a failure if I do, but each day I turn on my pc I feel like dying.\n\nReally hate this (just need to rant) - got a msg on my phone saying 19hrs a day on my phone - I realized I\u2019m just numbing myself playing chess/risk.\n\nGuilty because I have been given so much in life (and worked hard as well) but can\u2019t see the light now. At my desk now so that\u2019s progress.\n\nCan\u2019t kill myself (pain) and don\u2019t want to hurt my family - goal is to work and live and help others as best I can until I can self suicide in Canada or Switzerland.\n\nLove my parents and couldn\u2019t ask for a better life; just seems like I analysed it and don\u2019t want to put up with the day in day out stress.\n\nHummed consistently positive affirmations to myself to get moving today (shower grocery etc), just to have to do again soon.\n\nPulled myself out of depression at 22 and 30 and now 33. Sad because I feel like this is the reality of things. Also a latent stress since my dad is 86, but feel like I could lose him any day. And yippee, wait for a while to see my mom die.\n\nAt least I had many good years - consider myself blessed to have. Maybe I feel like life will just be downhill now.\n\nEven had some good relationships and travel experiences.\n\nWow - a suicide letter wouldn\u2019t do justice to my parents and loved ones. Thing is it\u2019s not them - it\u2019s just the setup of life; most cruel joke (really tried believing in some religion, but can only say I\u2019m a believer in \u201cGod\u201d) - tried mushrooms once and felt/ experienced that in the end all is/will be okay.\n\nIt\u2019s just the daily grind! Feel like I\u2019ve been duped into staying around this long. Nothing but pity to those who took there life.\n\nSigh; determined not to go back on meds/ therapy- felt like I learnt all I need from that and now just need to man up and work.\n\nDon\u2019t know if/ how I\u2019m going to make it (no choice but to). Think I got too low and I\u2019m on a downward spiral- was given everything and so close to being a \u201cgood\u201d contributing member to soviet but instead will end up being nothing.\n\nThankful to God for bringing me and blessing me this far; but a cruel joke to bring me this far and then take it all away. If there was a red button to wipe me away without harm to anyone, I would.\n\n5,4,3,2,1 - trying to wmend on a positive note - I am capable, one breath at a time, I can do this!\n\nGood luck everyone! If you\u2019re listening God, please take away my pain/ struggle and all those who experience depression. Wouldn\u2019t wish this on my worst enemies (\ud83d\ude02thankfully I don\u2019t even hate anyone or have enemies per say).\n\nSigh. Stay positive.",

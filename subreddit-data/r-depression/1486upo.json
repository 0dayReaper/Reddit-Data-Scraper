    "postText": "For context my parents were fairly neglectful/abusive and I've been in therapy for a while.\n\nI feel like despite my efforts I don't really feel happier for any substantial period of time. After doing an activity or hobby I quite like I'll feel cool or whatever but it's a very temporary feeling and it doesn't even happen all that often.  I still tend to feel drained at the end of the day and generally uninterested in doing much. I'll still try and force myself to do sometime, but it never really makes me feel happier just more accomplished. I hate that I'm not happy and I hate admitting it, I like pretending I'm happy because then it makes me more likable.\n\nThe only thing that in recent years has ever made me happy for a substantial period of time was a romantic relationship and it makes me feel like I'm somewhat dependent on that to make me happy. I've done a lot of work on myself and although I think it makes me more devloped,etc I'm not sure how happy I am in comparison. Sometimes I think I only feel better because I've been able to put myself in better situations (clubs, sports, relationships,etc.)\n\nHowever the problem is that soon I'll be doing lots of summer classes plus the psychical training and hobbies I already do. I just don't know what to do, do I just say it's probably gonna suck and I'll be miserable and just do it?\n\n Sometimes I feel like I'm waiting for something magical to just happen and make me happier and I know that sounds terrible, but I've really put genuine effort in trying to be happy and content with what I have and trying to make the most out of it, I just do feel all that much better. Maybe I'm just not a happy person and the best I can do it pretend in the meantime? I just don't know what to do and I wish I was different. ",

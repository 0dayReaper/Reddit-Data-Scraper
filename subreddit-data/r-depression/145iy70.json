    "postText": "I finally now have the courage to write this. I'm depressed and I need help. I'm a teenager in high school. All my classmates hate me, and I sometimes wonder if my family loves me. Sometimes I feel that my parents are just reluctant to love me... I do love my parents, but sometimes I feel really scared of them... I think I'm getting emotionally abused? I mean, they sometimes make fun of me- I know that they're just joking, but sometimes it really hurts... And when they argue, I feel like I'm about to die. I did a depression test online and it says that I'm mildly depressed. I tried telling my parents what I feel, but they didn't seem to understand... Or maybe they didn't care. I've researched about depression and anxiety a lot and I have all the symptoms mentioned. I know that self-diagnosis is not accurate, but I don't think I'll be comfortable talking to a therapist actually. I'm constantly overthinking everything - literally everything. I also daydream really a lot, is this normal? I have so many imaginary friends and I always vent to them. I rarely vent to anyone in real life even though everyone vents to me... I guess it's because I'm scared they'll hate me... I don't love myself at all. I don't know how to. Everyone is always judging me and this is literally torture. I just wish if was never born... I always blame myself and I think I'm just a mistake. Also... I've been having suicidal thoughts lately... And my heart really aches.\n\nI'm writing this because I really need help to get out of this black hole of depression that's killing me. Please help me. Thank you.",

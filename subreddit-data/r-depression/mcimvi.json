I never talk to anyone- just listen to my music and try to do whatever, but today this random girl asked me if I was doing okay because I looked more down than usual. i told her \u2018im good - thanks though\u201d! i knew I felt myself getting worse and I guess it\u2019s showing too. \n\ni guess it\u2019s nice that someone asked though, even if i lied.",

Especially with people we don't have trust or safety with.\nThat being said if she said she noticed you're more down than usual that speaks volumes. 1 she had the courage and kindness to come talk to you in the first place 2 she has noted you, and you're emotional state enough to see that you appear down usually, and 3 she felt that you were more down that what she is used to seeing. 4 seeing all this she might have been worried that you were at risk of self harming\n\nIt sounds like she's a caring and emotionally intelligent person. I don't know your situation OP but having a friend has made the hugest impacts on me when I'm depressed. Especially someone that isn't normalized to you, or how you feel. When there's that freshness people really listen, and we have an opportunity to share ourselves more fully because the whole story is unknown to them. So we aren't just giving someone an update or feeling like are inconveniencing them by taking away from the good times of a friendship with our problems. Instead we have the chance to provide context, backstory, and reflection all while gaining their unique perspective and curiosity.\n\nAt least that's what I've experienced. \n\nIf it feels like a good idea you could also say hello again, and share a bit more authentically. Doesn't have to be a full disclosure thing but even just saying I'm having a tough week if she asks you how you are doing is a good start. I find that when I don't share about my depression at all it feels more overwhelming, and inescapable because I'm being fake with the world, and I don't feel seen for who I am (because I'm not being honest about how I am in the moment). \n\nIf you want to talk it farther and say that you weren't quite comfortable sharing with her when she first checked in but that you appreciate her kindness that could be a good step!\nIt's totally up to you though!\n\nAlso hell yeah for hitting the gym!

With that simple search, I found a depression therapy group that met once per week at $10 per session. Just talking to people who share fundamentally similar issues has made me feel better, and maybe it'll make you feel a little better, too.\n\nGood luck.",

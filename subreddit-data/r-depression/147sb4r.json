    "postText": "I'm sharing my intrusive thoughts here, as a way to express myself. To those who choose to read this, I want to express my gratitude in advance for your patience.\r  \n\r  \nSo, I have recently graduated from High School and got accepted into a well-reputed university of our country. My high school years were mostly spent at home since I dropped out around the age of 13 and pursued homeschooling and self-study thereafter. Despite spending most of my time at home, I maintained close friendships and genuinely cared about my friends. I had a small circle of friends, which suited me well since I'm not particularly social. \n\n\r  \nHowever, ever since I started university, I've found myself surrounded by such an overwhelming amount of people, and I've hated this from the very first day.  I hated going to Uni. While other freshmen were having the time of their lives, I simply dragged myself from one class to another, constantly reminding myself that the day would soon come to an end.\n\n\r  \nAll of this feels very strange to me. Back in middle school, I used to be the most extroverted person, known by everyone in my class. Being around people used to energize me, and I cherished spending time with friends, which I still do to this day. However, I cannot deny that I now find solace in being alone, even though I also despise the feeling of loneliness.\n\n\r  \nThe comfort of my home's privacy has become an addiction, and I'm unsure of how to address this issue. I have a strong desire to quit university already, even though it's impossible, and I'm fully aware of that. However, I simply can't continue like this any longer. I hate going to Uni. The classes feel like a chore, and I constantly find myself unable to concentrate during lectures.\n\n\r  \nI'm exhausted already.",

            "comment": "Can you just ignore people? Idk how the college system is in the US, but I also have that issue going to college, I feel overwhelmed by being around so many people. But I just try to ignore people or in between classes going to the library and relax. Also, you really like your career? If your classes feel like a chore, maybe (maybe I'm wrong) being overwhelmed by people is the last drop. At least for me it is something like this: career &gt; people. Despite hating being around so many people, I learned to tolerate people (also my anc headphones helped a lot).",

And you are right \u2014 building a successful career should be my focus, but not all the courses I'm taking are related to my major. Some are just minors that I have to complete due to college regulations. And trust me, they are not fun in any way.",

            "comment": "Introversion/extroversion is how your brain functions. It's not if you enjoy being social or not...\n\nTo introverts, \"being social\" might be interpreted as noise depending on the individual and state of mind, or because they have a need for another way of socializing.\n\nYou're probably introverted, by the way you describe how you're feeling. So maybe try to find your personality type, and see how you can manage life best based on that?\n\nYou might be an INFJ like me. We have Fe - which is extroverted feeling, meaning we are more aware of others feelings than or own, which makes us act a bit extroverted in sometimes. When we're stuck in a Ni Ti loop, we may use Se - extroverted sensing to navigate, which is really bad, because then we interpret everything as noise. \n\nI can be very social and I can be by myself for a long period of time, but this happens mostly when I don't balance my life, respect my needs and boundaries, etc.\n\nWhen you feel lonely, that's probably a sign. If you feel a need to retreat, that's probably also a sign. Balance is the key, regardless of your personality type.",

However, I suppose I should give it a chance and see what insights it provides. Thank you for responding to me, by the way. Even though I'm not familiar with the terms you mentioned (Fe, Ni, Ti, Se); they seemed to make sense.",

So I think you're definitely a introvert i.e.\n\n[https://www.16personalities.com/](https://www.16personalities.com/)\n\nWhen you've figured out your type, you should learn about their weaknesses and strengths and see how they apply to you. And also what kind of loop you might easily get stuck in, and of course how to get out :)",

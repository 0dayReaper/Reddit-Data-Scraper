    "postText": "I feel like I am sad for no reason.\n\nI am a 27 year old girl, who thought after getting a ok paying job I\u2019d be happier, but I am not.\n\nI have it really good, my bf and I live together. We both work most of the day. I work from home, my job is great and I don\u2019t do much and make good money.\n\nMy bf and I are house hunting. \n\nHowever it feels that ever since I started this job, I\u2019ve lost control of my time. I have a hard time getting up, I sometimes have to shower or clean on my break.\n\nI think my issue is that I don\u2019t know how to manage my time efficiently.\nMy apt  is a mess most of the time, I struggle getting up, I am always working on time but barely, by the time I get off work I am absolutely emotionally drained. \n\nI don\u2019t know why \nI don\u2019t find happiness in the things I used to.\nI am not excited about anything. \n\nMy partner is on the same boat as me.\n\nI don\u2019t think my relationship has anything to do with this, we\u2019ve been together for 8 years and we love each other. (Even though we are working on making time for us)\n\nAm I broken?  \n\nI feel lost.\n\nBut life is good and idk why I feel like this. My problems are so minuscule compared to others. \n\nWhat is going on?",

I just wanted to share in solidarity that I feel the exact same way and am in an extremely similar situation. 29(F), live with my bf I have a good relationship with, have an okay paying job (and it\u2019s even something I care about), and work remotely, but I feel the same way. I\u2019m just starting to think more and more that these kind of remote jobs (and office jobs in general) don\u2019t seem to have very many tasks to complete that feel like an accomplishment. It\u2019s just work with no reward but survival. I\u2019m personally starting to think about just trying to work part-time, if I can pull it off, to spend more time doing things where you can see the fruits of your labor ( even little things like cooking ).

That idea is based on living purposefully.\n\nSo you feel drained, because you're not living purposefully in your current job.\n\nYour life is good. You feel a lack of purpose, *because* you understand that people have it much worse.\n\nContributing in this way, would help you live purposefully, and so you would be happy.\n\nOf course, I cannot tell you how you could improve others lives, and it will not be easy that either.

It's so easy to try and compare to others, but you just can't ever do that. I tried explaining this to a friend recently. The thing is, even in absence of anything as bothersome as you describe, even if that wasn't the case, even if you had something that you couldn't even name, it's possible that is \"enough\" for you. Tolerance levels are not connected to the problem. It's not like you are obligated to feel happy despite adversity. Something that might be downright catastrophic to your brain, might be a brush off to someone else. The thing you're not paying attention to is, may said person has more brain chemicals to deal with that problem, or they don't have other things that collectively affect your ability to deal with your problems, or maybe you just have a lot of little things you aren't paying attention to, or maybe they are wealthier or have a better support system. Are you getting what I'm saying? There's basically two parts here: what is negative enough to affect you, is enough. And at the same time, you actually have legit problems that you can't compare to someone else, because suffering is suffering. You just don't have enough happy brain chemicals to overcome what is happening and that is not your fault!",

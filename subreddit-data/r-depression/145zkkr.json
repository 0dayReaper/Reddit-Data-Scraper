    "postText": "I just don't really like people, I find myself getting burned or disappointed quite often. A majority of friends let me down by either going mental when I won't date them, or just idfk disappearing into the void. I wish I didn't have to spend time around other people so much, but as a human being I'm biological wired to need social interaction. This is not me trying to say everyone is shit and I'm perfect. I'm really flawed, I know that. Situations are never black and white. But regardless, I just find getting myself involved with other people is a recipe for getting hurt. I have one best friend I love. I wish that was all I needed but I find myself wishing I had a group to go things with. Maybe that's selfish. To be honest, I wish that I didn't even have that desire in the first place, but I can't fucking help it. I think I've always wanted a group of friends I can trust in, and believe in. At the same time, I just want to be left alone and never have to speak to a soul again, besides my cat. I'm a walking paradox, apparently. Yippee.",

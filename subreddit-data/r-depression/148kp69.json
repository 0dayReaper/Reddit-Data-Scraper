    "postText": "I read a korean comic that I just want to share who battles depression like me. it's called \"the strange story of The Novelist and His Neighbor\" in that comic there's my favorite scene where he abducted by a parent whose child was already gone. the mother was blaming the author that now her daughter was already gone, she said maybe if the author published the next book maybe her daughter would stay and read the book and battle her disease just to finish the book. but no she's already gone, the mother now wants to take her life as well as the author's. then the author said \"do you really think that killing yourself will make your daughter happy? there's not much to life, People just live because they're alive. Even if you lose someone you love and you lose the will to live. If you still try to live day by day, at first it'll be hard but what if you started small?  little things like being excited what to eat tomorrow, waiting to see what will happen to a drama series, and just like that, a day, a week, a year will pass... and if you start like that, one day it'll change, but now you have to live for yourself, if you just stay alive .. one day you'll find it - the reason why do you want to keep living. maybe a day, a week, a month or years. you'll find significance and then live your own life.\"\n\nI battle my depression by reading comics waiting how the story would end, keep waiting for the sequels and just by that I have reason to live along with that, the thought that what will my family feel if I killed myself especially my mom and dad. even it is hard just live everyday.\n\nwe have different battles but I hope you find your reason to keep living everyday as I have found mine.",

    "postText": "Love is such a horrible thing. It sneaks in and then just tortures me. I like someone and then the world just deprives me of any hope. And I overthink everything and make it negative. Yeah I guess I\u2019m the one torturing me. But I don\u2019t know how not too. Just wish sometimes I had someone next to me. But how could anyone ever want to be next to my mess of a mind, my mess of a self esteem. Sleep is the only true escape for me. Like when I feel down enough I don\u2019t even wanna drink or anything anymore I just wanna be unconscious. I don\u2019t want to be able to think or feel just be able to breathe. And trying to put all this into words the is so hard for me that it actually makes me tired.",

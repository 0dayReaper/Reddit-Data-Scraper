    "postText": "I\u2019ve been depressed and broke up with my ex for the third time and we tried couples therapy so I don\u2019t know what else to do\u2026 a big part of that was made because of the way his mom treats me (he stood up to her) and the fact it\u2019s been going on for months\u2026 idk maybe I\u2019m in the wrong but I just don\u2019t like being mistreated multiple times. We would argue about it every time too. My mom is always trying to get me to move in with her but I moved out because she literally asked a few days after I turned 18 when I\u2019d move out and would yell at me every day. Kind of don\u2019t want to depend on anyone anymore and I realize I\u2019ve been reliant on my boyfriend for that safety and security which I don\u2019t think I\u2019m getting anymore\u2026 and we were about three years cause we used to get along. It really sucks",

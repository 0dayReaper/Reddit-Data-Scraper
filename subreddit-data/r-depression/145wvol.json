I would do things if I had family &amp; friends to do fun things with like wakeboard.  I\u2019m 32 &amp; attacked this problem throughout my twenties, trying all low and medium-hanging fruit 8x over.  Extremely frustrated &amp; low energy since all initiative &amp; effort of 10yrs has failed",

I have bad anxiety and I couldn't sleep because I had decided to go to a shopping centre on my own. Almost didn't go. But eventually I said fuck, and went out to do what I needed to and even came home with a new book to read. Though, I don't think your situation will change if you don't change it yourself. That's up to you. Why do you need another person to do things with you, can't you enjoy going somewhere yourself? Why not go for a walk, or go find a place to get food, that kinda thing... something small, but something you choose to do on your own. Work up to the bigger stuff.",

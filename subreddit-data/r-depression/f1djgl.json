I believe it's called \"fetishizing your pain\" and definitely isnt healthy. I've found I've gotten better about not doing that as much as I used to, and also dont seek out drugs to numb my pain as much (nobody's perfect though, definitely snorted a xanax last night to calm myself down.) Try and distract yourself instead, I've been obsessively reading these posts and trying to offer advice to others, and I feel a little better as a result...",

The bioavailability orally is 90 something %. I'm sure it still works for you but your wasting it because it's still only active orally even if you sniff it as it drips down the back of your throat. Like someone above said it's not water soluble. There's zero reasons to sniff Xanax or just about any benzo's for that matter except I think 1 or 2.\n\nTake smaller amounts of it if you get stomach upsets and you'll probably realize that you'd be using it more efficiently than sniffing. It's not uncommon if you take too much of it on an empty stomach to have it give you nausea. The typical remedy to this is to take smaller amounts and spread it out over a longer period of time.\n\nOnly trying to give u advice on how to save more of ur stash bud! Have a good week, peace.",

            "comment": "Hi friend. I have often felt this and have recently found a way to use this idea of being \"addicted to depression\" to improve my mental health. Not saying this will help you, but perhaps there's something you can take from my story.  \n\n\nIt began with an awareness that once I started to dip into a depression, I would begin to feel a pull towards it, an attraction. Sort of like I would allow myself to be brought down into a dark but strangely comforting hole. I often describe my depression as alluring and cunning. I find a false comfort in it, a reason to avoid reality.   \n\n\nI've felt like this for years and years but just a couple months ago I was meeting with my therapist. Something he said triggered me to blurt out \"I think depression is my addiction.\" Confessing that verbally in someone else's presence caused a shift in the way I think about my depression. Suddenly I was able to just allow myself to have positive feelings. There was a feeling that maybe I've been exacerbating my depressed moods by purposely limiting any positive experience or thought. I felt guilty and ashamed about it, much like an addict might feel shame for their drug habit that negatively affects important relationships.   \n\n\nI spent some time meditating on this idea of treating my depression as addiction. I visualized it differently and ultimately felt like I had more control. I still feel that I have a stronger than average propensity toward experiencing depressed moods, but I also feel that I have control into how addicted I allow myself to become. I'm only several months into this experiment of thinking differently about my depression, but it has brought me a new level of mental clarity and even some hope, so I'm going with it. It has also allowed me to overcome the fear of making some major life changes (quitting my profession, selling car, reevaluating what I value).  \n\n\nI know everyone experiences depression differently, but if our versions of it are at all similar, I would recommend trying to fully admit an addiction to it. Then spend some time sitting with your emotions. Meditate. If you feel negative emotions, do your best to observe them. Don't avoid them, but also don't invite them to stay around longer than they naturally do. If you feel positive emotions, observe them first, then engage them. Tell yourself that it's okay to feel positive emotions. It's okay to feel okay. It's okay to even feel happy.   \n\n\nI've been working on this for several months. At the beginning, the amount of positive emotions I was having was close to none, but each time I found something I would try to expand on it. Don't feel frustrated when the depression comes back, just wait for the next positive moment and engage it. It's a mental exercise; observe the negative, engage the positive. It takes mental effort. It is work. Treat it like you would treat exercise for your physical body.",

I literally had never heard anyone other than myself describe depression as feeling like an addiction until I read this post.   \n\n\nAnd no, you are not a horrible person for being like this. You are not a horrible person now matter how deep your depression, even if you kinda feel like you put yourself there. That's why depression is so cunning. It lures you in for the comfort, familiarity, and protection from reality, but it keeps you under by convincing you that you're a horrible person for letting yourself go down so far. Then you might tell yourself that you deserve to feel this way. But in reality you deserve to feel like a regular functional and healthy human being. You deserve to feel the sun and take in the sky. You deserve to feel beauty and be moved by compassion. You deserve to even feel simple joys that you may never share with anyone else. We all deserve this. I hope that many of us in this sub can experience this more if we allow ourselves to practice it.",

Low is down, dark, quiet, can feel safe, like in a protected hole. It's a place to go when you feel overwhelmed, and thinking this way, suicide appears like the ultimate safe hole.\n\nHigher energies like joy are brighter, clearer, but can feel sharper, too intense. People want orgasms but not 24/7. Higher energies are much more active, expansive, communicative though, and I have to believe that we can find a middle way in which we can still feel the depth and safety of the hole, but have our head up in the sunshine where all the life and change is happening.",

But it makes sense, when you repeat certain patterns of thoughts, you reinforce them. I can literally feel the spiral whenever I accidentally get pulled in by just thinking negatively.\n\nThe solution is perfect as well. It's not repression that one must do (never repress, in psychology it's a disaster) but acceptance, observation... Like you said. Meditation helps a lot. Eventually I've found my old circuitry has not been used much and the natural negative thoughts gradually disappear.",

Don't even know how to describe the feeling. \n\n\nI think it's the self affirmation bias. \n\nBy looking at the world through that lense of sadness, it allows our world view to explain nuances and complications through the warped prism of the emotion sadness. The emotion helps to explain reality because perception is reality. \n\nBut if you try to be more objective and less emotional, there's less to grasp on and more of a sense of internal chaos and confusion. There's no cornerstone emotion to latch onto when explaining the details of life. \n\nWhen sad, the self affirmation bias helps to further incentivize the prism of sadness. BUT you are blinded bexauee a lack of objectivity, but it gives you more of a concrete internal thing to hold onto. \n\nI think? Idk",

The simple things and the free things are much better then the complicated and expensive ones. We are all going to die one day so just take it easy and keep calm.",

I think the psychological problems come in when you're unable to distinguish the aspects of what are making you sad from your own natural state.\n\nLike I often like to cry, because when I cry it feels like a deeper release than even anger or catharsis. I just don't pretend that what I'm doing isn't an intentional effort to make myself cry so that I can accomplish the practical goal. It's hard to walk away from that situation not thinking that whatever is your catalyst for sadness is not just a part of you, even if it's not.\n\nSo I try to relate my sadness to a global situation, that way I can commiserate rather than make it so specifically about me that I'm forcing my body to respond to activation of that memory with actual sadness. You know I want to be sad about dying children in the world, it's a rational thing to be sad about, I don't want to be sad about my lack of meaningful romantic partnerships.\n\nIt's just a trick of the mind, but it's better in my mind to commiserate than to isolate myself as a suffering loner. I can release my sadness into the rest of the world, and it all becomes part of the \"big sad\" which is all the suffering in the world and while that can seem like this insurmountable and somehow worse problem, in the long run it isn't because then every time I actually do see examples of humanity overcoming these larger obstacles I can also use the gladness and joy from that as a catalyst for healing myself, on the personal scale.   \n\n\nFeeling human has advantages, accepting flaws as a part of the condition has it's unique rewards even if you're depressed.",

More specifically, the brain is programmed by experiences over time, most significantly when we are young children. If a child experiences consistent negative experiences at the beginning of life (neglect, for example), then the brain gets programmed very quickly to \u201cnobody cares about me\u201d. If that program isn\u2019t quickly diminished by opposite experiences, then the subconscious program gets stronger and stronger via neural connections. The hardest thing for a person to change are their subconscious emotional responses that became engrained in them as children. It\u2019s possible though, and I have personally done it. It has taken over a decade of therapies, diet, meditation, and other healing practices. The most effective teacher on this subject, in my opinion, is Dr. Joe Dispenza (YouTube). Although I don\u2019t personally subscribe to his healing strategies or practices, I am a firm believer that he is spot on in his theories about subconscious programming, and how it occurs so subtly every day of our lives. If left unchecked, these emotional responses eventually become the elephant in the room that most people don\u2019t want to face.",

Introverts are people who prefer alone time and to a normal it may seen like a depressing lifestyle but it\u2019s not I learned it the hard way. Introverts are not depressed people they just find comfort in less social events. Real depression is terrible and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you can just get addicted to. I always feel drained when it came to social events Compare to everyone else around me that was ambivert and extrovert and with healthy mental status who has the best day ever. I learned I had depression because I got negative to the point where I used to self harm (one of the addictions I had) and cry everyday just thinking about killing myself. That just from jr high to high school but in high school was when I developed terrible anxiety. To top it all off my parents are terrible at been parents because they didn\u2019t find out months before my grabuation. They where told multiple times about if but they didn\u2019t take it seriously and told me I needed to get out more, find a partner and I should be 100% happy again. What a bunch of bullshit. That\u2019s all ever hear from them and I\u2019m still not cured. I\u2019m too old to de pretending I have depression.",

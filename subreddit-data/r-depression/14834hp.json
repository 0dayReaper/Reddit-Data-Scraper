    "postText": "I feel like I can't take it anymore.\nI know it will only take me a few more hours of my mental break down to go back to numb and ignore that I have emotions till the next break down but I'm scared. I'm so God damn scared to relapse into alcoholism and other means of self harm.\nI've been crying ans shaking for the past hour. I haven't drank anything yet but it is so hard to resist. I always hoped I would not buy new alcohol but I never resist I have so many bottles just standing there. I'm all alone, a friend that I trusted with my hard ship and asked to stay with me so I am not alone had 9 minutes to spare before going back to watching a movie with other friends of his. Now I feel more alone then before.\nHe says I love you, stay safe but it feels like he doesn't even care enough to stay with me. \nI just want it all to end. I wanna feel free and be happy.",

I would say pretty much lifetime emotional flatline. That changed little more than when I got involved with a woman. Suddenly emotional roller coaster. 2 weeks ago and completely spiraled. Reach to the few I thought were there. Nobody returned my calls. I get feeling alone. Other than my now former girlfriend I only one other locally that I did not see as a resource. It was people on here that got me through that spiral. Even today some reached out to me. I got amazingly lucky. Due to this dumpster fire of a year. I had put hope and into my girlfriend. Huge mistake. That other woman I knew turned out to be extremely important. But it was people on here that reach. Call it paying it back it forward seems to be why I keep sticking around here. I have no answers and no solution. Hell I have alcohol sitting next to me so I get that too. Only thing I have to offer is I'll listen. This is not the first post I've replied to tonight.. I'm bored, I sympathize and I can relate.. I I hope around like I was lucky enough to that cares and calls on your bullshit. Is she always available? No. She has her own life. You might want to try to give your friend a bit of a break. What I that was my closest friends\nOne of them calls occasionally. Other people don't get this at least in my experience. Pretty sure these people do care but it doesn't feel like it. Add a girlfriend that I have felt hasn't cared for awhile. I get feeling. I've may have left the basement twice in more than 2 weeks. Bottom line in my experience there are people that do give a damn about",

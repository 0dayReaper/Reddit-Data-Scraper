I\u2019m out of a relationship a good while but just can\u2019t over it, but was shown some messages on Friday from my ex to another person telling them what she really thought of me when we were together. It was all one big lie. And I feel daft and stupid now. Just totally fed up with everything right now and don\u2019t can\u2019t even motivate myself to do any of my hobbies",

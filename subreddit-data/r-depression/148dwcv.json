    "postText": "I\u2019m tired of being me. Tired of being dumb, anxious, sad, a loser. Tired of turning to everything bad for a slight mood boost that ultimately drags me down further. I\u2019m tired of my unfulfilling job I hate, tired of feeling alone. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing this. To vent I guess. Not like I feel like I can in therapy or whatever. Fuck it. Just have to make it through the day before I get to the only good part of living: being unconscious.",

I just started this mindful self-compassion workbook last night because I\u2019m also tired of my mind berating me.  I like it so far even though I\u2019m just a couple chapters in.  I used to do more self compassion work that helped me a few years ago but I haven\u2019t been for awhile now and my mind is back to kicking me when I\u2019m down.  I\u2019m also tired of how much work it is to get/feel better lol.  It sucks how when you\u2019re at a low and are overwhelmed you have to muster the strength to climb out of it.  I hope we both find the strength to do so! Fuck you depression.",

I\u2019ve tried therapy and doing the homework and at the end of it I\u2019m still the same me making mistakes and being a fucking idiot. My problems never get solved or just change, but I\u2019m never content or happy. Might just quit therapy and call it a day on that, try some workbooks myself. Idk. Probably not. Hope you beat depression and life is good.",

I will say that it\u2019s not a one step fix all but I always come back to it.  It does help even though sometimes you have to change therapists to find one that starts really helping.  Sometimes I also make myself go for a month or two longer to see if that person really isn\u2019t helping or if it was just a lull in the process. My last therapist went to get her doctorate so she stopped practicing a year ago and I was mad because its so hard to find someone I gel with lol.  I\u2019m back after over a year to where I need to get a new one.  I think of it like maintenance.  I like the workbooks or books for the no waiting, you can\u2019t schedule your depression.",

He\u2019s trying, but idk. I guess I can switch again but the effort of telling everything again and trying seems more than the benefits. I guess I just wish it was a one step fix all or even just advice and suggestions on what to be instead of me just sitting in silence.",

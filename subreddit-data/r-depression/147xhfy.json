Maybe it was some where else... don't remember, its been a long time.\n\nI remember the best power was the, \"Zach Morris time out\" (time freeze) from 'Saved by the Bell'.\n\nI didn't agree at the time and kinda brushed it off. Surely flight or teleportation would be the 'best' power. But, as time goes on... I realize just how right they were. Time freeze would be incredible. What couldn't you do? Its like when they say how Batman can beat anyone with preparation. Well, time freeze and you have forever to prepare. You could beat Batman.\n\nI used to be a 'teleportation please' person. These days, I'd love to be able to freeze time. Forever feels like true freedom when our lives are so lacking in freedom. A flower only blooms for but a moment. If a flower could stretch that moment out, it probably would.",

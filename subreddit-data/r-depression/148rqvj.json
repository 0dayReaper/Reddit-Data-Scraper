    "postText": "I\u2019ve been at full out war with my depression (MDD, GAD, BPD) and alcoholism since COVID.  I thought I was masking it well enough, being high functioning.  But apparently my wife has had enough, and is looking to divorce me.   Mostly due to my lack of recovery and my drinking.  \n\nKinda had a breakdown.   Boozed up to my teeth, and rode my motorcycle (with no protective gear) to get a burger before committing myself.   Apparently my wife called the police for a welfare check, and they came in and very politely let me finish my burger before driving me to the hospital.  \n\nI was essentially catatonic in the ED.  Just wanted to fall asleep and never wake up again.  Now I\u2019m in a Crisis Stabilization Unit, which is a big room with a whole bunch of recliners (hospital lay flat ones). I mostly sleep and sweat, and think far too much.  \n\nHonestly letting me keep my phone was truly kind.  I\u2019ve just been cruising Insta and look at cats in between breaking down in tears.   Kinda wonder if you can ever run out of tears, ya know?\n\nI\u2019m on all my usual meds, and l am getting Librium too.  \n\nI know I need to recover, but damned if I don\u2019t want to hike up to my motorcycle, finish off a fifth and drive into a wall very fast.  \n\nTell me stories of how you recovered.  I need support from my internet tribe.",

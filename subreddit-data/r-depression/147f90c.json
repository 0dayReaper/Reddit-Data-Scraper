    "postText": "I really hate when people ask if im doing alright. What do they want to hear that I wrote a suicide letter but I keep telling myself one more day? That every night is a struggle and I pray I dont wake up? That I often think about how and when I'll kill myself? I also really hate when people apologize and say itll be okay for the smallest inconvinence at work, its really the last thing on my mind. Im taking a week off from work soon but with how hard weekends have been I'm actually worried I wont make it through it.",

Like...why the fuck did you even ask if that was going to be the extent of the conversation.  \n\nAlthough, in his defense, I will say he's heard all my usual reasons for my depression before so he already knows what I'll probably say.  Still, the act of asking if I'm okay then walking off without saying a word when he gets an honest answer stings a tad.  \n\nIt can't be easy living with me, though.  So I have to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I get very miserable routinely, especially as the weekend ends and another miserable week of my bullshit job approaches. He's probably sick of it but is at least nice though to not say so.",

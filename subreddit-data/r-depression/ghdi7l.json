Not sure what I expected though.\n\n\nYou exist in this hellhole and you're just like... Chill with it? Like I'm so happy for these people but it's mindblowing! Like I have never known a time that I didn't experience severe recurring depression so it's just fuckin crazy that these people are real? One even said they don't understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason. Like I wish so much I could say the same.\n\n\nLike logically I knew they must exist but it's still just unfathomable in my mind. It kinda makes me sad that I don't understand them just as much as they don't understand me. But I'm glad at least someone is happy in life. Idk man.",

I feel so out of place.\nI just want to hide.\nThey even forget to drink booze they bought and I'm over here so depressed trying to stop drinking cuz I drink too much cuz I'm sad. I can't even. \nStrangely being around such constant joy just makes me more sad. \nI'm depressed but considered myself a positive person, like I make a huge effort to be happy for my kids sake. \nTo see it just be how people are I cannot fathom. They are happy in their marriage and no financial issues, taking a year off to travel for fun. I am like how are these people real???",

He also unprofessionally questioned me when I gave him a three out of five on his evaluation. I would have thought that was going to be discreet, LOL.

Building up the courage to talk about how you feel or why you do (or don't do) what you do is one thing, but then having them understand (or just listen) without judgement is another.\n\nWhile I don't have advice you probably haven't heard before, I will say that once you've found the courage and that one person you're willing to risk opening up to, just do it and see where it takes you.\n\nWhile opening up hasn't magically fixed anything, it's calmed my anxiety just a tiny bit because people seem to understand what I'm going through. This path isn't easy, so take as much time as you feel necessary.",

And I get to watch it all take place, with the complete opposite experience and perspective. Makes me feel even more lonely in a way. \n\nMy sister just came up to me and said she's feeling hopeless about the future and isn't trying to let this virus affect her mental health and no one understands but I  understand, of course I understand. I've been living in this mental hell for around 5 years now. That hopelessness she feels? I've experienced that every day, again for 5 years. \nMy mental health has been on an awful ride for 5 years. \n\nThe only difference this has made in her life is the fact that she and her bf can't go out as much anymore. She said to me \" i dont even care about getting the virus anymore. I just want to eat out again, go walk around the mall again, go to concerts again etc.\"\n\nIt's not like she ever experiences the loneliness, she's not in financial trouble since we all still have our jobs, in fact we're getting paid more because my company is giving us a couple dollars more an hour for working during these times. it's not even like they went out constantly either. Most of their nights were spent at home together. \n\nI know I'm basically saying she doesn't deserve to feel this way, cause technically, if it really is affecting her, even in a slightly bad way, she can't really help it. She does deal with a little anxiety but nothing major. And I would never say this stuff to her. I told her I'd be down to talk about all of it if she wants to because she knows I deal with all of my mental health struggles too, but I can't help but feel like its almost a slap in the face, since her life hasn't changed THAT much.

These people who are out there living their best lives are fucking having to deal with some anxiety and shit that's out of their control and weighing on them heavily for the first time and they don't know how to deal. We on the other hand, have this shit as normalcy. For us, the dark shadow that we normally have behind us just got a tad bit darker.

Just like you'd expect it would be if you have high stress, lower access to healthcare, less support, less nutrition, less time freely available to enjoy your life, underpaid underappreciated job role etc. Being poor can be directly related to depression. Not saying that's the case for all people but being wealthy does give you a head start.",

I feel like I\u2019m an asset at work, that I\u2019m loved and appreciated at home, and that life is just gonna keep getting better. \n\nThe only bad mood I really get in these days is anger. I get angry about people who harm my family members and I get really annoyed by dumbass coworkers. I don\u2019t wake up sad or hopeless anymore. When I wake up, I\u2019m not waking up with a smile on my face necessarily. It\u2019s more of like, peace. I get some coffee, have some breakfast, and enjoy my time at home before having to leave for work. \n\nI still have other problems outside of depression, like a little bit of social anxiety as well as ADHD. ADHD always fucks my shit up in terms of motivation and executive dysfunction lol.\n\nETA: I\u2019ve also seen a lot of trauma throughout my life. Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019ll ever get through it.

            "comment": "I know people like this. My best explanation if a person who copes with depression and a person who doesn't wanted to try to understand each other: \n\nAs an individual with chronic depression, I imagine the other side of the fence are like the days we have that sometimes break up the consistent bad days. You know the ones I mean. \n\nYou wake up in a pleasant way, having actually slept well the night before. It's beautiful outside, you don't have work, class or any other obligations for the day. You decide the beauty of the day and your good mood should be spent doing something that you enjoy on your own. For me, that's when I take my old DSLR D40 out, put my headphones on, one ear piece on, the other clipped over my shirt collar and plugged into my phone. \n\nI'll go for a walk through my neighborhood, looking for things beautiful, interesting or that catches my eye. \n\nOr maybe I'll go for a drive first, go to some of my favorite places; The woods I grew up traversing by the lake with the old camp cabins still stand. There's an open field between two areas of woods and trails. I've occasionally had beautiful moments with curious animals, though not nearly as much as I wish. \n\nI head off again to snap photos of my favorite restaurant fronts &amp; unique bits of the original buildings from the town's founding, still intact. \n\nI might do any number of things next. Maybe I'll treat myself an ice cream cone, or I may decide I want to make a few batches of cookies for no other reason than to make the house smell of vanilla extract and cookie dough. \n\nI might decide it's a perfect day to sit outside and read just to still enjoy the sunshine. I might take my dog out for a walk , though admittedly that's for both of us. I may even play a little PokemonGo while we're out.\n\nI might end it with anything from taking my camp chair from the garage, looking up at the stars that I can see so clearly from the backyard. \n\nA hot bath or maybe a cool shower then play with my cat for a while before we are both ready to settle in. Whether I return to my book, decide to watch something on whichever streaming service while working on a puzzle book or coloring in one of my many *Adult* coloring books. \n\nNone of the photos from the day will be for social media or even to share proudly with friends. They're pieces of my life and they're images from a day I felt content, maybe even happy. They're just for me to look back on and remember a day when I was happy, by myself, doing something I love and doing it just for me. \n\nNow, to my actual point. I'm not suggesting that I think those lucky enough to be well-adjusted, emotionally stable people spend every day like that. Obviously that's absurd. \n\nWhat I **DO** think is that the content, relaxed feeling we get when as a day like that winds down; that feeling we want so much to hold onto and take with us from sleep to awakening again... I think **that** is what, for lack of a better term, *normal* is.\nI also think those folks have far more days like that regularly. Only they don't have to hold on tight when they go to sleep because that content feeling is just their standard setting.\n\nThey absolutely have experiences with temporary depression. It's the depression of going through the grief process of someone we love, especially when the loss is someone we were extremely close with; parents, siblings, children, friends, pets, or S.O.'s. I believe very firmly that when it comes to grief, we are all the same. \n\nI **do not** believe, nor have I ever felt that because I struggle with depression that my grief is more intense or harder to cope with than for a Non-Depressed person. I very much believe do believe that grief, while different as individuals going through different losses, we grieve the same. We feel the same intense misery, sometimes just the numbness and the feeling of being at a loss of what to do, how to cope, etc. \n\nIf I was trying to explain to an **ND** what living with depression is like, I would say first that not **every** day do we feel the full intensity of pain and sadness like that we all experience with loss. It is not a full, overwhelming struggle *every* second of every day on a permanent loop. It's more like spending our days in various stages much **like** grief. \n\nThere are days when we absolutely feel that despair and misery, overwhelmingly. Other days, it can be more *regular* day. We may not feel completely encompassed by a sense of dread but the possibility of that is never far. Plus, there are a vast array of other areas of depression and there isn't always a specific reason for some; no triggers. \n\nHopefully that gives us all a window into each other a bit.",

I feel pretty happy. I\u2019m currently on no medication, and haven\u2019t seen my therapist due to lockdown. I remember thinking for years I wouldn\u2019t be in the mental state I am now, but here we are. I still feel weird sometimes, have fall downs and tend to be negative, but overall I can say I\u2019m pretty content with my life. Still don\u2019t have many friends, cut down a few, doing pretty bad in college, living with a psychologically abusive person and feeling alone, tho.

Idk..they dont think about things or linger on things for long. Like theyre more prone to do things, say things, for the sake of themselves and not care about how they affect others. If theres a problem they just either try to fix and if they cant fix it.. they forget about it. Like i was talking to 2 people and we were talking about concerns of how future generations are gonna be affected by social media/ the internet...1 person totally was on the same wave legnth as me and we were like lowkey depressed about it...and the other person you could tell that it was something that never crossed his mind ever and he had the mentality of like \"you cant do anything about it so just forget it\". Which is something i cant understand.\n\nI honestly still dont get how there's people that arent depressed....but thats the only insight i have to understanding these bizarre creatures.",

The life I have now is the life I built to make me happy.",

            "comment": "I suffer from waves of depression. Sometimes I won\u2019t be depressed for months at a time and then just be hit with it for like half a year.\n\nIt is an amazing feeling being able to wake up feeing great. Not constantly procrastinating and not having anxiety attacks every day. But this in the end makes me more depressed when I am going through an episode because I literally can\u2019t get out of bed. No matter how much sleep or little sleep I get I just don\u2019t want to get out. And then I think about how I *can* I mean do it when I\u2019m not having an episode and just feel extra shitty.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to think people can live most of their lives like that happy and ready for the day. Currently in the middle (or maybe end I hope) of an episode and god I want to feel that great again. \n\nIt\u2019s genuinely like life could hit you head on and you are ready and prepared to accept it and move on. It\u2019s fan-fucking-tastic.\n\nI hope one day we can all experience at least a year of it",

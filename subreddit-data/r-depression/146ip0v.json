    "postText": "I'm crying here right now. I have had depression most of my life but it definitely has gotten worse. I've lost friends due to it...not because they \"dumped\" me, but because I just didn't want to see or talk to them. I've also always been envious of people who have happier and more fulfilling lives with so many accomplishments and things to look forward to so I cut these people out of my life. There are many times that I wish I did have a good friend though but I know I'm not a good friend so I don't even try anymore. One of my biggest passions in life was traveling and I typically did all my trips independently alone however now that I'm older, I have found myself going through crying binges during trips wishing I was just back at home with my dog. I also would socialize every now and then with coworkers I got friendly with but I stopped going making up lies about why I couldn't go. \n\nI've tried different therapists as well as group therapy but I hated going and being there. I'm talking about trying for years. The only thing I ever got out of therapy which I have remembered and applied is that not everything people say or do to me is in order to hurt me and to look at their intent. It definitely changed my perspective with how I interact with people. \n\nI'm not *uic*dal and don't physically self harm myself. I don't drink, don't have any problems with substance abuse, don't binge eat, don't not eat, etc.  It's just almost like I would rather continue to cry in my misery hoping that at some point I find inner peace and happiness but there are definitely more bad days than there are good so when there are good days (or good moments) I try to remember those. \n\nI'm posting here because I know that no one knows who I am which I like. I'm likely older than many here in my late 30s and bisexual despite my user name. I gave up trying to talk to my parents because it has always backfired when I've spoken to them about my depression years ago. They definitely don't realize how bad it has gotten. I visit them every weekend because they are getting older with my mother having health problems (she always had them) and with my father showing signs of dementia which adds more to my misery. I know I'm a failure to them especially to my mother. My mother wishes she was a grandparent and that I had married so she could experience all those traditional experiences mothers often have with their children and I'm really upset that I've never been able to give her those. I am hoping to get pregnant in maybe 1 or 2 years but I know I'm not in the right frame of mind to be pregnant and to become a parent.",

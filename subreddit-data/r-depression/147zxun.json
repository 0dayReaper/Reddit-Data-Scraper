    "postText": "Trying trying trying to get involved with state services and programs to help get me off the streets and into living care so I can start to care about grooming myself and learn how to adult and drive and be more in control of my emotions, but I'm just getting nothing. There's a million different services but all of them have waitlists. I'm told I need case management, but case management is a waitlsit too. I'm trying to advocate but somehow I only come off as competent and not in need of help. I can't get help. I'm ADHD and autistic with depression anxiety and CPTSD and the longer I have to wait and the more no one reaches out with a solution or even to tell me they can help, I'm getting restless and I don't know what magic words I need to say to get help now. I need help NOW. I'm not a danger, but I'm not going to make it on my own without help, I need services. I need a nurturing environment that helps me want to care about myself. I have almost no impulse control and while I'm very social, I'm constantly pushing more and more what I can say to a certain person, who gets to hear my intrusive thoughts, but then they just slip out anyway. I don't know what to do. I just want to get help now, and I just want to admit myself to the psych ward, but I'm not suicidal, I just want the pain of being alone to stop. I've been there before, but that was only for an attempt. Otherwise, I'll only end up in the tree room and have some nurse tell me my problems aren't real and I'm unappreciative of the psychological abuse my family disguises as love and I just need help. Every damn service closes just when I am ready to contact them. End of the day. No one is around. No damn crisis lines because again, not suicidal, and even then they don't help because my problem is crippling loneliness and they can't fix that. I'm, there's no damn groups out there for me. If there is, there's specific requirements. Wait list. Everything is a wait-list. The more I reach out, the more incoherent and unable to control my frustration I become. I don't believe yelling will get me anywhere and I'm avoiding it as much as I can. I just know I start yelling because all the pain is trying to escape and I'm worried I won't be able to get it out before my feelings are invalidated. Help. I need help. I'm homeless with shelter now, just a motel room, but tomorrow I won't have anywhere to go and I don't know how to stay awake all night and be safe at night on the streets. I don't know if there's any help for me right now. Even if I was able to get in the psych ward, they'd take my phone from me so I wouldn't be able to get calls from services, and again, they're not going to let me in just cus I'm homeless and give me special privileges. Why is this the life I have to live if I want to be free.",

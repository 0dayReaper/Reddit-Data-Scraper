    "postText": "Hello I have been feeling depressed lately because yesterday I was hanging out with some friends when out of nowhere one of them started acting all crazy on me I tried to calm him down but I ended up getting angry and we started fighting I was going easy on him and letting him get his balance whenever I would hit him hard and then I started having an asthma attack while defending myself from him and he managed to get me  whilst I walked away with only a small black eye and I also gave him a bloody nose and was literally super close many times during the fight to dropping him I still went easy on him yet he tried to beat me up while having an asthma attack it makes me very angry I don't want to seek revenge and don't even feel I should be sad but yet I am sad and I do want to seek revenge I would really appreciate it if you guys could cheer me up somehow. Much love to everyone.",

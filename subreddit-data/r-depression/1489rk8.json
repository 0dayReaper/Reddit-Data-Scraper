    "postText": "Hey. In being depressed I\u2019ve noticed that I feel wholly unloveable. My depression has successfully convinced me that all of my qualities, physical or otherwise, are at best repulsive and at worst, grounds for punishment. I feel worthless. I feel like there is not a single person on this planet that would enjoy my company. In feeling this way, I have become very reclusive and sensitive to criticism. I even interpret jokes made at my expense as attacks on my character. Lately I\u2019ve just been agreeing. \u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d \u201cI am ugly, what can I do to change?\u201d \u201cI know I\u2019m boring, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d I don\u2019t have the energy to defend myself or understand that these are just harsh jokes that my friends and I have been making for years. But since I haven\u2019t been in a relationship for a very long time, I\u2019m beginning to really believe them. This makes me more depressed and therefore less motivated to better myself, less motivated to try to date. You see the problem. I think I have many flaws, but the truth is all I want to do is to love someone with all my heart, give them everything I have. I want to be considered special just by one person. The fucked up thing is it feels like at this point I am asking for far too much. Im watching all my friends find love and I\u2019m happy for them, sure. But the pain and jealousy are indescribable. They eat away at my heart like maggots on roadkill. Needless to say, I cannot live this way anymore. Starting tomorrow I am going to begin taking an antidepressant, Lexapro. If it helps me, I am going to do everything in my power to become the best version of myself. Im going to do everything in my power to do what I really want. Again, that\u2019s to give someone my entire heart. I refuse to let depression hoodwink the few good qualities I possess. Im going to begin fighting for my life, not because I believe I\u2019m worth it, but because the person I give my heart to is. Thank you for reading this. I hope you\u2019re okay and I hope you know you matter, and you deserve to be loved.",

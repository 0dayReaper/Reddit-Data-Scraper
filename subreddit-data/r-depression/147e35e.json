            "comment": "I'm so sorry, what's going on in your life is truly awful and you don't deserve any of it. Your mom and sister are 1000% wrong to think of you in such a way. You are not an embarrassment. You are a person who has suffered so much and there's nothing embarrassing about that. I once dated someone who fell apart completely while we dated from PTSD symptoms suddenly manifesting. Your story reminds me of that person. She lost most friends and family simply because she was seen as lazy or pretending to be mentally ill to get out of work. I once yelled at my mom for saying such things about my ex because believe me there was no pretending. I woke up several times in the middle of the night to her screaming in fear and shaking horribly. She even temporarily forgot who I was a few times while experiencing a PTSD flashback. People like you and her deserve to be healed and cared for but sadly we don't live in a world that looks at people like you or her kindly. If I had the money, I'd give everything to help people going through things like this. I'm sorry I can't do anything like that though. Please don't give up, I know I don't know you and you don't know me but I don't want you to give up. I am available to listen anytime you need to talk to someone, just don't give up. If I may ask, what do you enjoy? Is there anything you like to do? If so, I ask that you focus on those things. I, for example play with my cats and watching anime after work! Always remember, you are a person deserving of respect and help just like everyone else.",

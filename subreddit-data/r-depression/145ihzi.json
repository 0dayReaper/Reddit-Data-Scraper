    "postText": "I don't want to be happy. What's the point? The down is just going to be lower than if I was already down. I like to stay down and solemn. I don't like to get my expectations up. I don't like good moods. They are to easy to be ruined and the low you feel is so much worse than when I keep myself neutral and just sort of expect it. I don't want to keep going back and forth to the doctors and figuring out meds. What's the point? My life around the medication isn't going to change? That's why I'm depressed. Why would I want to try and feel this incredible high and in comparison make my lows even lower. I'd rather stay down, depressed, cynical, etc. It's safe. Nobody can hurt me. Nothing can hurt me as bad. I am protected",

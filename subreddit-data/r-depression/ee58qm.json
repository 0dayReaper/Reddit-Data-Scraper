Especially when they are hurting. It's easier to say then do but work on not letting it get to you. Her words, her actions can't break you if you don't let them. I still struggle with this because every little girl wants their mom deep down. But my life is so much better without her around. I learned to only give her limited info about my life. I learned how to navigate the world on my own rather than reach out to her. It made me stronger as a person. \n\nI completely understand your pain. But trust me, it can get better.

Sure if your kid got a new job or got admitted to college you can tell people about it, but some things are private and need to stay that way. \n\nI once got caught by my mom when i took xtc and she thought it was a good idea to bring that up around my uncle, aunt and grandma. I was a bit on the younger side as well and they all gave me judging looks and i legitimately lost trust in my mom that day. That trust has been restored now but it took multiple years before i started to confide in her again.\n\nTrust can be lost in a second but can take years to reclaim and it's already really hard for me to trust anyone.

Kept trying to force me into those situations so I'd \"face my fears,\" which lead to one of the most embarrassing moments of my life when she tried to take me to a (fully chaperoned) party with about a hundred kids from school, maybe 3 of them I felt comfortable around (who were all hanging out with different people.) I walked up to the door, felt dozens of eyes looking at me, and panicked before running back to the car.\nOnly then did she at least stop forcing me into those situations\n\nIt wasn't until my younger brother had the exact same problem that she started to understand, but it still took the convincing from one of his teachers for her to schedule him a counseling session.",

Not everyone understands. You can chose to educate or simply not speak to that person about it. If I find something someone does or says in regards to my depression makes me feel like dookie I tell them that they make me feel like dookie.

Family doesn\u2019t require blood, it only requires love. What she did? Was not love. It only shows her inner insecurities which she projects onto you, her daughter. You need people who genuinely care for you. Honestly in my opinion, blood doesn\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t treat you like family. You deserve better than this.. you really do. Sometimes I wish all the pain that people like you feel would just be redirected to those who actually deserve it.",

You have to be strong just to prove them wrong, then you can do what I did and just walk away from them and never talk to them again if you don't want to. I used that thought  when I was younger too just make it through the days. \nBe strong. We are all stronger then we might think, and while this moment hurts you can do it. I did.

They believe it\u2019s a mindset, something that can be turned off if we really tried. \n\nI was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety as a Junior in high school and my dad, to this day, tells me to \u201ckeep my mind clear\u201d and to \u201cnot think bad thoughts\u201d. He wanted me to get off the anti-depression pills as soon as possible (were pretty well off, I don\u2019t think money was the issue). I ended up lying to my dad and therapist telling them that I\u2019m alright now (I literally told my therapist that watching motivational videos on YouTube is what brought me out of depression and he bought it). I\u2019m not alright LOL. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry to hear that your mother joked about your depression. Our parents are supposed to be the ones who support us no matter what as well as be very focused on our wellbeing. For them to treat your illness as a joke is horrible and it\u2019s obvious that she\u2019d feel horrible if you ended your life early. \n\nI don\u2019t think my father did anything as bad as what your mother did, but it can be said that both parents don\u2019t really understand depression and its effects. Quite possibly, they may never understand. \n\nFrom here you have two options I think: first would be to separate yourself physically mentally emotionally from your mother. Hearing and knowing that she thinks like this is extremely detrimental towards your health and well-being. \nThe second option is what I do, pretend I\u2019m not depressed when I\u2019m with my family. Even if it means being fake as hell, I try to put on a happy face whenver im with my family. This can only be done if you have a strong support group who knows about your issues; good friends (of which I am so grateful to have). The second option is best imo because you never know when you\u2019re gonna need help from someone. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t great advice sorry lol. I hope you can figure this out and I\u2019m sorry again that this happened to you.",

Find someone who can fill that gap for you to carry on with your life, maybe a friend, a teacher, a coworker and anyone else, they can be your family in this case.\n\nDon't show them your weakness anymore, wear a facade and just pretend and show them that you're ok, an average person in their eyes enough to give them the benefit of the doubt. And then when the time is right, if you can support yourself, just leave without a trace. You're much stronger than you think. You dont need them in your lifr anyways. But dont decide rashly, they are still your biological family, they are obliged to help you just until you can support yourself. Take that advantage and prepare yourself, study, earn a degree  land a decent job and just cut them off in your life.\n\nImagine yourself in the near future, to the day you have moved out of the house, has a stable job, literally you can do what you want in life, looking back and laughing how you fooled them all these years, thinking that they thought your emotional distress was just a phase, but in reality you beat them all at once, including them.\n\nLet that distress fuel your will to carry on my friend. There are tons of things you can and want to do. Maybe do some spontaneous things like join a club that you least liked, talk to anyone from the class, engage with humanitarian work, randomly pick a hobby and stick to it, play a games that you normally dont play with. Dont be afraid to try something new. The least things you expect are usually the most interesting and rewarding.",

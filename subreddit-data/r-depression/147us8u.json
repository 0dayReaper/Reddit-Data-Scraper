    "postText": "I've been suffering through a major depressive episode for about 6 months. It was triggered by moving homes (which I very much regret). I cannot seem to get passed this regret and really cannot unpack or function too much. \n\nI go to work and required social outings but really do nothing in the way of self-care. The only thing that makes me feel good is substance abuse (although that feeling is fleeting and short lived). \n\nI see a therapist weekly and am on antidepressants. I am also trying substance abuse recovery groups/AA.  It's not working.\n\nI am now at risk of losing my marriage, etc. I also have regular thoughts of self-harm/taking my own life.\n\nI have a good job and career. Summer vacations are planned and booked. But I need serious help -- I would consider inpatient wellness or substance abuse therapy. I am just concerned about:\n\n1. My Job\n2. My Relationship -- will my wife still be there for me when I get back?\n\nAnyone else been through this?  She doesn't seem exactly open to me leaving her with 4 kids for a few weeks.",

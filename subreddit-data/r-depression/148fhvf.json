    "postText": "For the past couple of weeks (4-5) I have felt so hollow. Like a deep sensation in your chest and you can just stare at something for a long period of time with your thoughts taking you on a roller coaster. I don\u2019t believe i\u2019m depressed, it\u2019s just nothing I\u2019ve ever really felt before. I\u2019ve never felt like an outcast or empty or lonely like this until now. It\u2019s a feeling i\u2019m so unfamiliar with and I can\u2019t stand it.",

I\u2019m assuming you posted this because you want affirmation that you\u2019re depressed so you\u2019ll feel welcomed in the community. Don\u2019t let that hollow feeling take over though. There\u2019s no reassurance to be found in depression",

I don\u2019t necessarily want to be depressed, Idk why I posted this, mainly just to feel included somewhere like you sorta said. I\u2019m normally really good at keeping a steady head but yea it\u2019s the first time i\u2019ve felt like seriously just shit yk?",

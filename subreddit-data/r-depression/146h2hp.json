            "comment": "I just started this type of treatment about a week ago. It's very quick and noninvasive. I haven't had any negative side effects. A potential downside is that the treatment is daily for a while (but it only takes about 20 minutes). I just sit in a chair while the machine does it thing and listen to podcasts. \n\n\nI can't speak to its effectiveness yet because people don't notice much until 10-15 sessions in. My doctor said it works for around 70% of people, I believe. I do think some people require periodic \"maintenance\" treatments as well, but not with the same regularity as the initial treatments. \n\n\nIf you're interested, I'd schedule an initial meeting with a doctor around you that does this. They'll be able to explain it better than I can. But if you have any specific questions about starting the process or the initial paperwork for insurance authorization let me know and I'll do my best.",

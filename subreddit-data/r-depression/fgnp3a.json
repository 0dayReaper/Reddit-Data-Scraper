Literally have two friends that I\u2019ve known since high school and they\u2019re getting sick of me because I vent to them and they\u2019re like \u201cdude, stop, you\u2019ve literally got it made, stop complaining\u201d and it doesn\u2019t help at all. Yeah sure, I\u2019m a senior in college set to graduate next spring, I don\u2019t even have my license yet. No job, stuck at the house every fucking day with my abusive parents. Too depressed to find love or even have the willpower to do my assignments. Afraid to go in to get help because I have to pour it all out to yet another person who has no idea how to help. Stuck in a rut for years and last summer got my heart broken by someone I thought I could trust, turns out she just wanted to get in my pants, and so when I got attached she ran. Now she\u2019s giving everything I wanted to someone else because I\u2019ve never been through loss, so she says. My parents scream at me about college until I\u2019m curled up in a ball in the corner of my room and then try to make it okay. \n\nSorry for hijacking your comment to rant. Had to get it out",

Then some have student debt and even with a good degree it can still give you massive stress. \n\nI graduated 6 years ago now and you should know that once you are done and can support yourself you wont care about your friends or parents stupid opinions. You'll be busy building your life the way you want. I know its cliche but their opinions will just seem hilarious in a few years. Even people nagging you about marriage/kids will just bounce off you because you'll be so busy building what you want and doing whatever you want. You'll have freedom and will have to answer to no one. And if you get married and have kids you can build your family with your spouse how you guys want. Your friends and parents will nag maybe but you'll be busy living how you want. Goodluck.",

Is it normal and healthy to not be interested in doing anything for that day? \n\nOr is this unhealthy behavior?\n\nKeep in mind that for social anxiety we need to push ourselves against what our anxiety is making us feel, or it'll just spread. \n\nWhich is what many don't seem to understand when they say \"just be yourself\", \"what is normal?\" because being myself would mean listening to my anxiety like I have most of my life, which has seriously held my back. And the definition of normal here is living a healthy, particularly socially healthy lifestyle, versus living under a rock and never going anywhere",

Self learned emotional disassociation &lt;aka anhedonia&gt; was thus required to keep my internal reactions in check to continue to interact with \"family members\", go to school, to work &amp; actually just 'be' in public. Not even \"home\" was a safe place to \"let it all out\".\nLikely,  had I not resorted to journaling, my inner world would have completely disappeared.... BUT, after many years I finally \"got it\" that haters gonna hate &amp; most folks - for whatever \"reason\" - don't care. So, though my emotions are still blunted, I flat out admit I'm not right in the head &amp; don't really give a F what \"they\" think anymore. I'm me. If you're not gonna invest the time to actually get to know me or \"why\" I'm me, your knee jerk assessment of who you think I am (or am NOT)  doesn't mean a damn thing.",

What should I do?  Just be a fuckin carpet?   To pave the way as some ungrateful American?  Fuck that man.  I know where I am, and I pity the fool who treads on me.  Fuckin throwing me out to the wolves.   \n\nAnother note.  Yes I expend tremendous amount of energy to seem normal around your kids, mothers, and the elderlies.  Beats the shit out of me every day.  Today was a complete meltdown.  Fucking ridiculous loss and grip of my reality.  \n\nWhy you may ask.  I'll tell you why.  Because I have $40 bucks to my name.  That's why.  Some people within your communities have next to nothing, they smile and act decently without a job, house, or any cash.  Looking out for your well fair.  Well isn't this the normal thing to do?  Wouldn't you do the same thing for me?   Or you going to berate me for pretending to be ok, when I'm walking in fucking hell?   This shit sucks the life out of me!  Here's the thing too.  Just when I choose to except this dichotomy, and try to be at peace with the \"fake it till you make it\" propaganda.  Some fucking shill will kick me while I'm down.  Unbelievable,...but you better believe it.  This is real man.  It is painful, and miserable.  Exhausting, and the alternative is shitty as well.

I guess, what needs to be better understood is what would that world look like for those of us who have depression. What if we did not have to be normal, what would that look like? Where is the line (should there be one, even?) between what we expect them to accept and where do we see that, rather than they?\n\nOften, this line, is the boundary of power between what is our agency and what is taken from us or even what we give away. Foucault theorized on this quite a bit. One way of shifting the paradigm is what is called the \"narrative turn\". What is the language that should be adopted to remove stigma from what is defined as not normal?  ANyway, this is what I think about when I can't socialize. Which means, what I am constantly thinking about.\n\ntl;dr-you are not alone.",

    "postText": "I feel like I\u2019ve come across this phrase in some shape or form countless times throughout the years, and for some reason it has never sat right with me. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because it seems to assume that one is solely responsible for their joy or lack thereof- that if my life is horrible than it is either a.) of my own doing, and so I need to try to \u201cdo better\u201d or b.) not of my own doing, but my otherwise reasonable misery is now apparently condemnable and a personal failing because I should just choose to \u201chave a better attitude\u201d anyways.\n\nOr maybe this phrase has always irritated me because it seems to imply that one needs a certain level of ambition/grit to mold life into something more tolerable, and I have always tended to lack that kind of eager perseverance about anything at all. \n\nWhen I feel really down about myself and life, these kinds of sentiments greatly anger me, as my brain immediately thinks, \u201c*Well if life is apparently just what I make of it, then I guess my life is just going to suck forever*\u201d which puts me in am incredibly cynical headspace as I mentally berate myself for not being able to live up to some vague notion of a better, more fulfilling standard.\n\nI don\u2019t know, what do you think of phrases like this?",

    "postText": "I have no way to cope. Can\u2019t drink. Can\u2019t vape. I have hair trigger rage and my 4yo knows how to push every button. Tried at least sitting in the living room to be there for her physically even though I\u2019m not there mentally and I blew up at her. Husband (rightfully) called me out for being too harsh, but pushed us to be in the same space before I was cooled down/ready to apologize. She forgave/forgot anyway. I decided to just go back to bed and self-quarantine to keep my bad attitude from spreading to everyone else. Cycling thru dissociating on my phone and just laying there staring at the wall doing nothing. I feel like such a shit mom/wife/person rn but I literally don\u2019t have the mental space to do anything about it. I\u2019m burnt out af.\nI don\u2019t wanna exist.\n\nEdited for typos",

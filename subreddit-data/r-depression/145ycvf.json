    "postText": "I've had depressive episodes on and off most of my life. Up until reseantly I've actually been out of depression as my life has finally fallen into place, and alot of the usual triggers for an episode have been absent in my life, on top of therapy helping with not just depression but other mental disorders, to the point I ended therapy reaching my treatment goals.\n\nWhich is why this feels so out of left field and strange to me. This time around, I still look at my life and see value. A steady job I enjoy 90% of the time, a house I own, a loving wife and adorable pets. I have an amazing social life, play DND with friends every week, and otherwise have nothing to be upset or depressed about.\n\nYet this beast has still chosen to show. I feel myself loosing interest in games I enjoy, including DND and art. I want to lay in bed more, and I feel the cleanliness habits I have worked hard to build beginning to fade. I feel like grabbing at water trying to keep what I have worked for so hard. The worst part is I can't find the trigger.\n\nUsually when depression hits me, I can look inside, find the trigger, solve it, and stop an episode, something I worked with my therapist, but I cannot for the life of me find the trigger, infact I don't even feel the *sad* part of this episode, having nothing to attach the feeling too. There is also an underlying fear that this depression may even take away the things I do value, and I'm terrified of what that could mean.\n\nI just hope it doesn't take my will to keep fighting before I figure out what to do.",

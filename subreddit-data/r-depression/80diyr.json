I feel like I'm getting weaker, much much dumber (I used to know a shit ton of trivia, a lot of history and be really good at helping people out. Now I've forgotten most things unless I read up on it daily, I've been relying more and more on canned responses when talking to people and I've become completely socially unaware). Things that used to be easy are now difficult, I constantly make typos and I can't even concentrate on things I like, much less things I dislike.\n\nAnyone else feel like that?",

As soon as you walk to the kitchen your brain creates a new box for it, thus ignoring the living rooms box. So when you go back to the living room to remember, your brain pulls that box back and remembers 'oh coffee!'. I read it somewhere, but it made me feel better about forgetting small things like coffee and keys. ",

When you\u2019re head is in such a negative space, thinking only about negative shit, it only makes sense that your thoughts would be completely jumbled. I doubt you\u2019re becoming \u201cretarded\u201d. Once you start feeling better, your communication will become more effective, and your thinking will become clearer. Don\u2019t beat yourself up, most people suffer from depression at some point in their lives, some more than others. Talk to a professional about your feelings, even if it\u2019s hard to click with somebody at first (my current struggle). Good luck! And know people like me appreciate you, and these types of posts. You made a stranger feel less alone today just by opening up. Pat yourself on the back! Hope you feel better. Best wishes. ",

In my late 30s lots of stuff I know I read when I was younger I barely remember. My mathematics skills felt nowhere near as sharp and had been really strong.  I thought to myself maybe this is part of how people naturally decline, I\u2019m getting older my best years are behind me.  I also worried that my history if chronic insomnia and depression may have had permanent impacts on my cognitive abilities.  \n\nI was tired of seeing therapists who I felt like each tended to diagnose me on his/her own biases (I like science, give me facts).  So I went to a specialist who conducted extensive tests on me. I thought those tests were for different mental disorders, and they were,  but unknown to me they also included an IQ test (among over 6 hours of testing over two days I didn\u2019t distinguish it from other mental health tests). And it turns out my IQ result was only a point lower than when it had been tested in middle school (so statistically negligable difference).  I was shocked when I found out and it has helped me revisit what I hadn\u2019t doubted was a real mental faculty decline as I got older.  This was only last summer, and with improved confidence I\u2019ve been revisiting some of the things I thought I had lost (like calculus etc) and am finding that I can relearn it fairly easily and that it has been lack of practice that has been affecting me most. \n\nI hope my story helps.",

Especially considering depression pretty much stops you from enjoying pretty much anything you know is worthwhile including things like reading, studying or anything which requires intellectual interest I suppose there\u2019s a cyclical aspect to it.\nThis has happened to me twice in the past 6 years. When I was a kid probably 90% of the attention I got was for my academic performance  so while I still enjoyed learning i let it define me and my worth. So when I got badly depressed when I was 9-10 ish that losing interest and the feeling of getting dumber really hit me and I got anxiety about it a lot. I was always worried about living up to my potential and proving myself. In hindsight I\u2019m envious of how I was then because I still had an interest in my passions. A similar thing happened again 5 months ago and I ended up trying to kill myself because of it.  I was getting dumber because I no longer had an interest in books or politics or art or my instruments because of depression so I had no reason to pursue those things and eventually just spent all my time doing nothing and wondering where it all went. \nSo I guess if it helps it\u2019s pretty much certain that it\u2019s a symptom of depression and is helpable as you recover. And if you\u2019re worried about it especially it shows that you can still get it back. ",

Although i still experience mental fog now and struggle with focusing, its nowhere bad as it used to be.\n\nFor anyone going through this, please reach out to a college /school/education support officer or counsellor.

The truth is though intellect fades when depression hits. It takes an impact on the frontal lobe of the brain, which in turn causes cellular degradation as well as a major slowdown in cellular development, so everyone on here who believes they suddenly got dumber when the depression really hit isn\u2019t wrong. There are tons of studies of people who had brain scans in which this showed up as true. The moment the brain isn\u2019t constantly focusing, even without us realizing it, on the sad, angry, ill fated things which occurred to us is the moment when our cognitive functions reappear. There are times in all of our lives and believe or not mine too when we fade.. just make sure this isn\u2019t the end for you. We\u2019re all here to support you!",

It's like you're so enveloped in cotton that everything takes ages to really simmer through into your mind. Which is not exactly a lack of intelligence. \n\n But I can relate to feeling dumb and dull. I noticed this fogginess depends a lot on circumstances like weather and sleep. If I sleep too long it's no good. \n\nAlso since I graduated from high school and fell into a deep depression subsequently and have been totally without aim and ambition since, I really feel I'm getting more and more dull, declining in all ways possible... it's kinda scary because it sometimes almost feels like I can actually watch this process, but not do anything against it.

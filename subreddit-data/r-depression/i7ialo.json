If you're experiencing chronic numbness, I can think of a couple common sources from suppressing memory or emotion, to a life philosophy of nihilism making you think nothing matters, to hyperoveranalysis leading you to think that every action you'll take will end in disaster so you'd rather not try, to past trauma leaving you highly anxious about judgement or rejection.",

But if you're looking for something more solid on these things from pros (which I'm not haha), memory suppression is something that Freud and Jung talked a lot about... although I think they were more talking about repression, which is something unconscious and I don't necessarily agree with, rather than suppression, which is more using coping/alcohol/drugs/eating to bury feelings instead of confronting them. Cognitive psychologists and other docs like Jeffrey Schwartz work on stuff related to brain plasticity and the effects of attention/focus on the brain, which helped me a lot personally.\n\nHyperoveranalysis I wouldn't know where to start in providing book recommendations and would be glad to get some, but from my experience, this is related to having a perceptive, ordered, prepatory mind that naturally runs to every dark and horrible future scenario, which is a good thing in theory. The part where things get worse is because that same person doesn't use their mind to come up with backup plans on what they \\*would\\* do \\*if\\* those bad things happened. Considering every worst case scenario without making contingency plans makes it far easier to expect the worse because there's no second or third path in mind: then come the muscle tension, body shakes, shutdowns and depression instead of preparations. It's far better to treat potential future pain as a signal on how to act, rather than something that's absolutely coming, you know?",

I absolutely believe suppression could be involved there. If someone wears a public mask to hide and stuff down feelings of self-hatred or to bury shameful or damaging memories, that's a link I'm well familiar with from my childhood. I acted as people expected because I didn't want them seeing the darkness inside, and didn't know how to confront the inner tangled mess so I just let it sit there until I started undergoing CBT.",

I think what you're describing isn't necessarily dissociation but rather masking or hiding yourself in order to fit in, although dissociation could be one of the symptoms experienced.\n\nIIRC more extreme cases of dissociation usually start in childhood as a way for your brain to sort of protect you through amnesia and the creation of new \"alters\" to deal with prolonged and inescapable trauma. I think repression is fitting there as to my knowledge it's not a conscious decision to suppress memory. Things like dissociative fugue probably deal with repression too, it's when people can't recall important information about themselves, generally in response to a stressful event, and usually wander off and even establish new identities. So it's possible that as the severity of trauma increases, the chances of repression does as well.\n\nI've experienced fairly severe depersonalization/derealization and it's definitely the oddest, most alien feeling in the world. I remember having lunch with a group of friends once and everything switched to video game mode, and I could not shake the feeling that everyone was just a character in the game controlled by game logic and we were all going to die lol. I still have weird video game-esque systems-based dreams. It's very hard to describe but once you feel it, you know it. Most people describe DP/DR as feeling unreal in the world, like they're watching their life as a film, if that helps describe it better.",

It wasn't that I suddenly developed purpose or anything, but Stoicism was more in line with \"I don't think there's a whole lotta purpose, but since I can't change that, I'll keep pressing forward until I find something that matters and prove myself wrong\". Of course, having something tangible as a goal helps a lot too... mine was a girlfriend in college and travel afterwards, and I've been living both with a wife and living abroad ever since.\n\nI eventually found my faith a few years ago and that's given me complete purpose, but from your situation, I'd highly recommend making the shift from Nihilism to Stoicism on the outset so you feel more of a fundamental basis for doing any good thing you want to do, any being any good person you want to be.

Mine was because I prefered the \"itchy, warm blanket\" of suicidal depression to the uncertain future, but once I started undergoing CBT for the inner rot and babystepping my way towards some easy goals, the future started to look more possible day by day so I could remove the blanket.\n\nDo you think you might be taking on too much right now with all this going down? I don't really want to encourage the weed thing (but it's your choice), but if vidya, food and maybe even the porn thing as a stopgap until you can get a good relationship, could provide a kind of backup mental army, you might keep them up while addressing the dark thinking with medication or therapy (be especially careful on the medication + weed thing, let doc advise that). I used to smoke a pack and a half to deal with this stuff while mentally fighting it, but once the roots were dealt with, I quit soon after.\n\nThe most important thing is that you get this inner darkness and tangled pain dealt with so you can properly move forward, whatever good way you find to do it that suits your situation.",

Also, I was very skinny, weak and  prompt to several illnesses. Faced and facing several psychosomatic sindroms such as IBS, chronic back pain and scoliosis... Lots of skipped classes, bullies...\nBefore long I lost that life and happiness which most kids are bursting with. I was a weirdo who instead of playing with other kids I was trying to remain unnoticed while staring at the clouds and wondering for the purpose of all that pain. School was awful, but weekends and holidays weren't any better, so the only times I truly enjoyed were when I was sick at home (which happened too often). \nAs a teenager I developed a food disorder without being aware of it and years after I faced serious medical conditions because of those habits I learnt.\nI've tried therapy many times. I've done lots of activities trying to fit or lift me up: studying, partying, gym, dance, meetup groups, yoga, traveling, volunteering, surfing, meditation, drugs... but I never could remove that darkness inside. I couldn't find anything good enough that makes all the struggle worth it and I end up tired and giving up.\nI've managed to meet some friends, have an engineer bachelor and get some jobs. However it's not enough and I can't keep it up. I've tried antidepressants several times but I've never found them too helpful. Only psychedelics help me to see life in a different way and get rid of my story, pain and fears and try something new, be my own master.  But eventually I get scared of going too far and finally I go back to my old self.\nI end up with the idea that I'm powerless: whatever I do I'll suffer and die and then anything will matter. If I try to avoid suffering or live any better most times I'll just make it worse. So why worry? This mindset allows me to keep living in a miserable way and secretly hating all these people around bursting life and energy.\nAny insights?",

And you're right that the inner darkness is next to tackle.\n\nThe last thing to check is on the specific root of the inner darkness. Would you say that it results from:\n\n\\- Constantly replaying shameful or painful thoughts of your past\n\n\\- A voice in your mind, probably in your sound, that constantly barrages you in the second person with highly generalized, self-destructive thoughts like \"You suck\" or \"You'll never win\"\n\n\\- A life philosophy that you don't deserve happiness or that the world/life is pointless\n\n\\- Not quite having an identity independent of your past set up, such that you're still beholden to your past... even if it means that you describe yourself as \"anti-mom\" or \"anti-childhood\" in your perception of yourself\n\nThe first two are far more signs of needing to exercise some kind of mental countering like cognitive therapy or inner thought battling, but the last two are more about getting a plan for your self and life in place to find a rock of stability going forward.",

I try to avoid following this thought but it appears often.\nThe third one sounds more like a fruit rather than the root. I can tell that I've developed this mindset overtime as a result of something crooked inside.\nThe latter is the one I can relate the most. Definitely I'm too attached to my past and my parents. Even though I tried going the other way around and develope something new I always end up doing what they expected me to do. \nWithout the tags of \"faggot, pussy, weird, weak, irresponsible, piece of shit, clumsy, lazy, awkward, incapable, harmless, naive, immature...\" which I've been tagged so often I just don't know how to behave, it feels just like writing with the wrong hand. \nI feel there is no place for me in this world but the place I've already taken. I've been so stuck in this role that I don't know how to behave outside of the script and sometimes it can lead to awkward situations.\nThere's something inside that couldn't went to the next page and remains stuck there. I couldn't find my own place as an adult man so I guess that I tried to unconsciously stop growing through fasting, vomiting, cringing and hunching my back like saying: \"don't hurt me, I'm just a helpless child, not a menace\".",

It might be a cycle like mine was if I'm reading your post right:\n\nYou don't know who you are or how to be that person, so you hold to self-hating thoughts and depression as a kind of rock of stability to keep from the uncertain (and possibly painful) future, but the longer you cling to the rock, the more depressed you get and unhopeful of the future.\n\nIt's kind of like holding onto a tree covered with biting ants because you don't want to let go and go to the ground floor of the jungle, fearing animals there will eat you.\n\nMy eventual wedge to put into this cycle was babystepping. I eventually developed a plan of becoming a person of confidence, honor and freedom, but I knew I couldn't be that person immediately. So I spent every day I could fighting back against the dirty thoughts hard and long, all day sometimes, that didn't change.\n\nBut for my personality practice, I went really, really slowly. Like I would talk to one girl for 30 seconds on Monday, take a full day rest. Then I would walk around the block of my house one time to explore a bit, talk to one girl for 1 minute, then take a full day rest.\n\nAs long as I kept pushing numbers up, things slowly got better because I slowly became the man I wanted to be, I was taking it really easy, and I was gaining in skill the whole time. And any time I got trolled, mocked, abandoned or crapped on, I just immediately pivoted away from that person and went to talk to someone else because I slowly came to understand that I don't have to get stuck on the jerks when there are thousands of other people I can go with.\n\nI think you've made a strong step in taking notice of the troubles you're suffering from, so planning and babystepping may be your next move if you're up for it, friend. :O)",

I had to spend many months doing self-administered CBT to confront the inner emotions, forgive the people who hurt me, vow I wouldn't let them or anyone else hurt me again, created a new identity separate from them with traits and qualities I chose, then spent many, many months confronting the inner darkness and practicing being the new me.\n\nBut getting separate, physically and mentally, was step one, because every tie I still had pulled my mind back to that rotten childhood every day I lived.",

You think it'll get better one day, that you'll just be going about your business and realize it isn't happening anymore, but it'll always be here, it always was, it just got easy to tune it out as a kid, but it was there even then.\n\nIt'll kill your spirit first, then gradually over time, you start to feel it in your body, chest pains, heart aches, pains all across, it's a patient thing, it'll wait it out because it knows you won't try to get rid of it, not really, not for more than a day or two. It's easy to give up when you know it's there.\n\nEven then, there's comfort to it, like stockholm syndrome, it has a consistency that's hard to get with good things in your life, it's easy to persistently feel shitty. So it makes it that much more tempting to go back to it, the torture, because at least it won't let you down like everyone else.\n\nI don't even know anymore man. I thought this'd feel cathartic or something, but I still feel stuck, I'm in a cage and I don't know how to get out.\n\nI mean, I do *know*, what I need to do, but I don't understand how to convince myself to do any of it, or that it won't fall back on me, or that it's worth it for a genuine moment. \n\nI don't know what I want to do for my career, hell I don't even know that I want to be alive 2-4 years later.",

It\u2019s a cheek swab test and once it comes back it gives you a better understanding of which meds would work with your genes. I have bipolar disorder type 2 and I was having problems finding the right meds for myself. It put your meds in categories of ones that would work work well, some that you would have to go in with caution or change the dosage on, and then bad ones. And it does this with each type of medication you might have to be on. Some insurances cover it and if not they do base off of income as well so you could get it for free. If you\u2019re interested I can go look for my results?",

I pulled over, decided I couldn't live this way any more, drove home, fell into my first major depression, and I've not worked since. That was 14 years ago. I've spent every day living on a pittance of disability living allowance and am due to lose my house soon, due to cuts in mortgage interest payment support. I've no other option but to move back in with my parents. So I'll be a 45 year old single guy living back in his old bedroom. Not the way I expected my life to turn out. Previously, shortly before my first wave of dread, I was married with a kid and a good full time job as a buyer. But I could never understand how people could live through that cycle of work/home/bed, day in, day out, for the rest of their lives. Plus, I had a problem relating to other people. I found it hard to relate to others and form friendships. I was always quite a moody, brooding, dark soul who couldn't relax and enjoy life and relationships. So I hid away in my lounge for 14 years. I'm still sat here now, watching my house crumble around me, because I can't afford repairs. I've been through plenty of dark nights of the soul since then. My depression has got worse with age. They just up the dose and hope it works for a while. All my old friends are still doing the work/home/bed thing, advancing their careers and pay packets, having kids, getting married. All getting ready for that day when they can retire and look forward to falling apart and dying.",

I literally emailed my therapist \u201eI feel like a zombie, like I am nothing, I died already.\u201c I died months ago due to hyperanalysis of myself and the meaninglessness of life. \nThe whole thing of course was an insidious, loooong process starting in childhood. I literally always hated life  and felt sooo fucking sad every day that I\u2019d have to go to school, while my sister could watch cartoons and sleep in. I compensated via video games, I was so freaking addicted, but that just killed my emptions and made me even more dependent on them. \nVideo games were better than life would ever be. Then it was anime and books. And then it was nothing. \nNow I am a nihilistic fuck and I don\u2019t know what to do. I am thinking about dropping high school. School is so freaking depressing. Actually, it\u2019s life. Life is the problem. My lack of social life and experience too is unbearable. I realized I will always be a loner and that made my heart ache so badly for 2 weeks, at some point I had to cuddle with my mom (i have no shame anymore) and the next day, she complained about her heart hurting. \nI am a zombie and no one seems to notice or care. Because I\u2019ve always seemed this way, but now I really feel the deadness. I now get why someone would cut themselves, just to feel SOMETHING. To release the pain. Oh man.",

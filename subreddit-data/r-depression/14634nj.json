    "postText": "So during and ever since leaving rehab I've had my last couple friends constantly checking up on me. Don't get me wrong I love them and love them for that but everytime they do I'm still in a bad place. I don't want to lie to them but at the same time I'm afraid of them leaving me because of me. They're the last of my friends, they go, that's it for me. On a semi related note, 5 months sober tomorrow :)",

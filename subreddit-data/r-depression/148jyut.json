No gf and don't have any faith that that will change which means no family either. Only a few friends. I don't even enjoy socializing much anymore so I don't really see that changing. I'm studying for a career field that I'm not particularly excited about. I've lost interest in almost everything I previously enjoyed before I became depressed. I cringe at everything I say or do.  It seems like everything that I put effort into blows up in my face. \n\nI just need something that I can put effort into that will actually be worth the effort. Any ideas?",

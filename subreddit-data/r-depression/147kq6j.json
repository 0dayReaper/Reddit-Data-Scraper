    "postText": "I've spent most of my life in my head and had no one close to me. A few months ago I started dating someone that is truly a good soul, patient and accepting of me. They take me out, encourage me, show interest and care. Shared my struggles and they understand, as much as they ever could. I met their family and we spend a lot of time together. But man, I feel so detached and alone. More so than ever. It's like I'm playing the part of a person that's not me, because there isn't anyone else inside to be. \n\nAnd sometimes I sit there observing it all, and it's so completely alien to me, everything- the way people interact, the things they say and talk about, what they want and enjoy in life. I can't relate or feel what they feel and that fact is continuously slapping me in the face.  \n\nI think for me the only truth is in the moments I'm completely alone in nothingness, and that scares me.",

I understand everything, having spent too much time in my own world., the fear of not being able to relate, everything.\n\n\rThe cruelest part is that at the end of the day we need attention, we need contact with others to stay alive. And it makes me even more disturbed because I can't seem to connect with anyone on a deep level. I'm just glad to know I'm not the only one.",

I hated going out on dates because I don't feel comfortable being around people if I don't have to. It makes me wonder if I'll ever properly date. I just don't like being in public spaces for too long.",

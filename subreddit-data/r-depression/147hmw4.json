    "postText": "I hate my brain so much. \n\nI have been doing so well the past few weeks. I\u2019ve been eating healthy, three times a day, drinking water, remembering to smile and make jokes and say hello to people at work. I\u2019ve been cleaning my house and doing everything I was supposed to do.\n\nand one little thing happened today and now I just feel a rush of negative emotions. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. \n\nI can rationalize in my head that it\u2019s ok and everyone around me says it\u2019s fine but the aftermath of feeling bad is is still lingering. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s going to carry on into tomorrow and maybe ruin the rest of my week. I know I shouldn\u2019t speak it into existence but it literally feels like falling in slow motion. \n\nI am probably gonna cancel plans tomorrow and not do any chores just lay in bed. \n\nI know people probably take medicine for this kind of stuff but I have $4 in my bank rn waiting to get paid and I\u2019ve already borrowed $300 to live off of that I owe back. I feel like I\u2019m never gonna have enough money for medicine and if I do, I might get really broke again I might have to be off it and then have a breakdown. \n\nI am fighting for my life right now trying to rationalize and manage this myself but it literally feels like I\u2019m under the influence or some kind of chemical being released in my brain. Just needed to vent.",

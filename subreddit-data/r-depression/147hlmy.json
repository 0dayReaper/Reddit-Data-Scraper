    "postText": "I am 15 and I want to switch to online school. I've already talked to my dad ,my guidance counselor and my principal. I honestly wasn't 100% sure but either my counselor or principal was gossiping about it because loudly and in front of my classmates my teacher asked me why I'm switching to online school. I thought since everyone and there mama knows now I shouldn't hide it. but now I feel like everyone is EXPECTING me to switch. I feel like my decision has already been made for me. I want to switch because for one, I need time to work, I want to go to school which means I need money, for two, no one at my school likes me. I don't get bullied, I'd actually prefer that, they just flat out ignore me. nobody in my teeny tiny school is aware of my existence. my classmates don't speak to me or include me. I had one friend but she made fun of me and when I asked her to stop she just stopped talking to me period. I've been so depressed my whole life because of my family/home life and this just made it so much worse. the only thing that got me through this school year is the idea of switching to online school but now I'm not so sure. if I want to go to cosmetology school I'll need to go to online school but the thought of not going to highschool makes me nauseous. I do not want to miss that but I feel like I have no choice. everyone thinks I'm going to and it just feels so embarrassing to even think about showing up next year when everyone thought I was gone. I wanted to keep it a secret so that if I didn't show up next year everyone would be shocked, like it was my last chance at getting even a little attention from my classmates even if I wasn't there to experience it, OR I could decide to continue public high school and no one would even know, no one would be disappointed I showed up. I feel sick just thinking about this because the more I do the more I feel like I want to go. in the past year I feel like I've gotten more confident and I feel like maybe my junior year wouldn't be so bad. I could be there for my best friends senior year and maybe kindle a relationship with my class, maybe they'd invite me to the class group chat idk. I just need someone's opinion on my situation or want to know if anyone has gone through anything similar.",

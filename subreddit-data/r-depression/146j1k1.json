You can do so much better things than dying. One thing I think you should try is service. Try to find somewhere to volunteer, it is the most fulfilling thing in the world and you get to help so many people, including yourself. I recommend finding a nursing home and volunteering for the elderly. You have so much life left to live. Please, please don\u2019t trick yourself into thinking you\u2019ve wasted it all.",

    "postText": "No one takes me seriously. I finally opened up to my friend about my depression and she told me I didn\u2019t understand true mental illness. My mom knows I\u2019m depressed and anxious, I told her on three separate occasions I needed to see a psychiatrist and she doesn\u2019t listen. \n\nNobody fucking sees me. Nobody hears me. And they just keep fucking pushing and pushing. \u201cDo this, do that, why won\u2019t you hang out with me? Just exercise more. People have it worse than you.\u201d SHUT THE FUCK UP. SHUT UP. I\u2019M TIRED OF HEARING THIS SHIT.\n\nI\u2019m so fucking sick of people trying to pretend like they know what goes on in my head. If they fucking knew, I would get locked up in a psych ward. I feel like the only way the people around me would finally understand how much pain I\u2019m in is if I tried to kill myself. Bet they\u2019d care then. Or at least act like it.",

I've learned that no matter how kind and caring and empathetic the person is, they will never fully understand how terrible you feel on the inside. \n\nBut at the same time it's given me a sense of personal power. I have to be the one to call the suicide hotline, be open, and cry. I have to be the one to book my psychiatrist appointment and be responsible for getting my medication because no one except me can fully understand how much deep pain I'm in. I have to be the one to get myself out of my own shit hole.\n\nThere are days where I feel totally helpless, where I feel like no matter what I do the darkness will consume me. During those kinds days I just lock myself to my bed and hope the demons pass by. \n\nThat's all I can offer you. I'm sorry.",

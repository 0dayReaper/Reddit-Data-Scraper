So in a sense I lost him too, but he was never a great father in the first place. \n\nThis happened when I was 19, I'm 25 now and it took years for me to fully get over it. I still feel bitter when I think about it.\n\nIt takes a long time to heal from traumatic events. I know it's hard but you have to be patient with yourself and one day you will feel better.",

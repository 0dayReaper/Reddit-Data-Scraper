    "postText": "Has anyone experience the symptoms of depression being lifted for no reason at all? I am wondering because there is not much I feel I can do about my state of mind. And have heard people just get up one day and started feeling better. Of course depression is complex and I understand every human being is different and have it in their own way for their own reasons. But is there like a god with a magic wand just curing depressed people randomly? Or are we just decaying slowly? I don\u2019t know if my way of thinking is any good. It just shows how I feel powerless about the way I am feeling! Thanks \ud83d\ude4f",

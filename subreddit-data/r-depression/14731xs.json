You're not completely necessary anymore, this person can live without you.",

And I think everyone's out to get me.\n\nThis has caused me to completely isolate myself and cut everyone out of my life. I literally have no friends or family. Besides my child.\n\nI work remotely and all my life is spent alone. My mind plays negative scenarios no matter what. I think everyone is against me and has bad intentions. \n\nI've tried therapy but don't confide because I feel my information will be used against me. And my child will be taken away if I tell the truth about my feelings.\n\nI've tried medication, meditation, I've gotten a six pack, and tried becoming the best version of myself. Yet I always fail to see the light. I'm so numb to life and I just want to die at thus point. My child is the only thing keeping me from doing so. And the fact I'm scared of what comes after death.\n\nSo I live day by day alone. Get my child a few days during the week then back to the same repetition. No friends, no family, no girlfriend, nothing. Just my negative thoughts. Life is hell for me. I'm so tired.",

NOBODY will replace you as a father as long as YOU don't allow it. 5 years ago I was in the same exact position myself and had the same exact feelings. Continue to be the best father you can be, as well as work on your mental health and it WILL get easier to cope with having someone else around. I know it doesn't seem like it right now. But stay focused. Because depression is selfish, it will lead to self-sabotage if you let it consume you. What I mean by that is, the very thing you are scared of is much more likely to happen( to an extent I mean, a bio father can never truly be replaced) should you become distant, or leave this place entirely. Remaining consistent in that child's life is the best thing you can possibly do, and will go a longer way with them than you realize. Regardless of whatever your flaws may be. I guarantee that if you focus on building and maintaining that relationship to the best of your ability, you will find more reasons to live along the way.",

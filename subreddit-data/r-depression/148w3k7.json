    "postText": "At the age of 24f I feel like I\u2019m messing up in life already \n\nI had graduated in 2021 in speech therapy but I dint want to pursue the masters because I\u2019m not interested in it. \n\nFor 2 years I have been working off jobs (warehouse gopuff (quit in 1 month),case manager(quit 1 month), Macys (temporary position), call center at early intervention agency (quit 1 month), Whole Foods warehouse (fired 1 months).\n\nI know this is not gonna look great in my resume. But yea I feel guilty about this already and that\u2019s why I feel like I\u2019m screwing up in life already. But I can\u2019t give up now like what call it quits in life and that it no. Not only I want to find a job but I want to be happy because I haven\u2019t been happy for a long time. \n\nIf so many jobs I got left from how can I make my resume better\u2026should I lie?\n\nI think the reason why im not staying in any of these jobs because honestly I hate the idea of \u201cworking\u201d. I do want to be productive and busy but I dint like the idea that im forced to slave away for 8 hrs everyday at a place I dint want to be at just to make money to survive. Like there had to be another way out. Of the matrix. Just thinking about this lifestyle seems robotic. I know some people are happy about there life styles working but if I do work I don\u2019t want to work for long. \n\nHopefully down the line I open my own business because working for other people for the rest of my life sounds miserable \n\nHopefully I can work online. Do anyone know of jobs I can possibly do right now? I live in Brooklyn NY.",

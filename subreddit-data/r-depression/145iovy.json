    "postText": "I planned 2 weeks ahead for a date with her and she arrived 1 and half hours late and only spent an hour or so with me with half of that time on the phone or in the bathroom of the restaurant. She also dressed up extremely well (she'd never dress like this for me). She said she had a dinner with a \"new client\" which was work related later that night, it was a guy and on a Friday night??. She apparently spent 4 hours with this dude and got home at 11pm. I don't know if this is the normal lifestyle of graphics designers, I'm an engineer and this sort of things that she tells me about that goes on between her and her clients are just weird from my perspective because in my line of work things work differently. I rarely even meet my clients on anything other than teams and it's a 5 minute call.",

            "comment": "It definitely sounds like cheating, nobody has a dinner meeting for 4 hours. You don't even need to ask her or confront her if you feel it to be true. It's clearly making you unhappy. What I would do if you can keep silent is pack up all her things and throw them out of your place if you own it or rented it when she leaves for work or another extended meeting. You don't even have to tell her but I would make it clear she isn't welcome back. If you want to wait longer it doesn't make you a bitch okay? It gives you time to find out if she really has cheated, for that I would still shut up about it but wait and see if she does it again or any more suspicious behavior because it will just be obvious to you. If you think she is the kind of person who would be honest then by all means I would ask her in a calm and as unaccusatory as you could, because even accusations make innocent people feel defensive. Bring up how it makes you feel not what you think is actually going down, (you could say you are uneasy with the way she does her meeting and would like to know more) I would still push it in the direction of infidelity but don't outright say you think she is being unfaithful, if it slips out fo her or she gets defensive about the subject regardless you have your answer then.",

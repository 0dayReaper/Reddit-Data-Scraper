    "postText": "trigger warning for self-harm and disordered eating\n\n(16F if that helps the context?)\n\nyes, i know i sound confused, but i think if i explain this you'll understand me. the easiest way i can break this down is with categories. i label these \"living\" \"surviving\" and \"dying\". when i feel like i'm truly living my own life, eating regularly and keeping on top of housework, i tell myself i'm living. when i start to fall of the rails, and i'm skipping meals and crying in the shower, i tell myself i'm surviving. when i relapse, when i binge then purge a litre of ice cream in fifteen minutes then chug water to replace the electrolytes, when i cut into the fat of my thighs then clean and dress it to prevent infection, i tell myself i'm dying. i know i'm happiest when i'm living, logically, i know that. but i feel so comforted when i slip into the warmth of surviving. it's so familiar, even when i've been living for months, surviving is so tempting. starving and stealing and cutting and smoking for the thrill of it is tempting. but then i tire myself out and start living again and feel guilty. why am i stuck in this cycle? how do i break out?",

    "postText": "I've never thought I'd come seeking for help on Reddit, but I have no choice. my boyfriend won't talk to me, my family is abusive and doesn't believe in mental illness, I don't have friends, I just need help. I want to kill myself and I don't know what to do. every night I sob for hours until I fall asleep, just to wake up and continue crying for the fact I am still alive. I want to kill myself and the last time I attempted was 2 years ago, but I just can't bring myself to try. I have no energy. I don't know what to do. I called the suicide hotline and I just didn't know what to say. I really don't know what to do. my therapist left me and tried referring me someplace else, but there's a wait list and I've been waiting for over 4 months. my psychiatrist never listens to me when I say my medication (venlafaxine) isn't working. I don't know what I have left.",

It may be time for a new psychiatrist if they won\u2019t give you something else.\nAlso honestly, maybe go to a crisis center of some sort (hospital, psychiatric hospital, etc.). They\u2019ll give you everything from meds to therapists to psychiatrists",

You\u2019re here in this world with everyone else, and you\u2019re inevitably going to die someday - so why would you cut your life short? As sad and tired as you might be right now, there\u2019s always a chance you\u2019ll feel happy one day. Since its gonna end anyway, why not stick around and see what happens?\n\nTake care",

    "postText": "This weekend I went on a group camping trip with a fellowship(NA) I am a part of, there was many people I did and did not know there.\n\nI enjoyed myself. I spent the whole weekend not caring about little things, being around a few people that I like, and while I was fighting negative feelings the whole time, it was the most alleviated I've felt in awhile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am home, and my depression has spiked dramatically. I've been in what I call an \"active\" suicidal state for a few weeks now, and I say active because I've been \"passively\" suicidal for as long as I can remember. Not a day goes by that I don't think about it, but it being active means I'm more willing to act on it vs when it's passive I am not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo keep things simple there's a large list of reasons I want this for myself, and I always have. The simplest way I can put it is that my entire life is a form of people pleasing. I do not live or do anything meaningful for myself, it's all for others. Anything I try to do to make myself happy does not work, or is temporary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like when I experience any form of joy, I am just waiting for the crash because that feeling is so infrequent. I don't want it to go away, because when it does the pain just comes back stronger than before. I can't numb out because of my involvement in NA, I am a big part of the structure in my group and people need me there. I can't kill myself because it would break my mums heart, and she needs me here. I just spend every day tortured by my own brain, fantasizing about going completely off the deep end so I can just spectacularly self destruct and leave it all behind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess this is a rant just as much as it is a question, I'd just like to know if anyone feels similarly to me in regards to anything I have shared.",

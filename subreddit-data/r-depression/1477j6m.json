    "postText": "My friend and I  (both 18m) who we have talked and known another each other since freshman year. Ever since I have known him he has always struggled with depression and his inner thoughts due to childhood and present trauma. We stopped talking months ago due to reasons between our own relationship and have talked back and been keeping in touch with another. He has told me how he has given up on everything and feels that no one understands him or he can't be helped. That aside with him saying he has no future left for him and suicidal thoughts hes always struggled with. I feel useless when he tells me because I know I can't exactly tell him as he tells me how he feels. He's been through so much and I wish there would be a way he could be helped or he can be soothed at times so he can feel better but I recognize it's not easy as I have gone through it although not to that extent but I know I on my own can't do anything and see where he comes from. I just came here to express how I feel for the situation because I care for him and wish there was a way.",

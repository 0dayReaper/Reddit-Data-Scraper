    "postText": "I've struggled with anxiety and depression for the longest time. Anxiety (maybe more specifically social anxiety) has probably been my biggest struggle. I've started treating my anxiety (medication and therapy) and now that I feel like that has started to feel like it's being taken care of, depression has been kicking my ass. Is this common? Has anyone else experienced this? Is it related to my medication? The start of negative side effects?",

The best thing to do is take your medication as prescribed by your psychiatrist. It is a big positive that you are also doing therapy in combination.\n\nI wish you all the best, take care.",

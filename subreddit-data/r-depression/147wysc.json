    "postText": "\n\nHi, straight to the point, I feel like I get no support in nothing. Especially from the close ones from me. I recently said I wanted to train more to my mother and she laughed and said I needed to run more, which I also told her I did before this winter and then she laughed again and said \u201c how many times?? One!\u201d And laughed again.\n\nI feel no support from friends, I just get avoided and I feel like the spare friend or just a guy following them. I feel like a burden to them and making it worse for myself there. \n\nI find hardly any joy in what I liked to do and I feel like I can\u2019t talk to nobody. My father does not like arguments and always stays with my mother on everything she said without even hearing what she said.\n\nThis had let me into a path that I don\u2019t like arguments myself and if one comes up with my \u201cfriends\u201d I so often speak to. If we come to a disagreement i just lay down flat accepting the loss and get rolled over with nothing to say.\n\nWith this I just feel worse and worse. I need advice, just something.",

Keep up your training and don\u2019t think about people that don\u2019t support you. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d force myself to go out and do something I wouldn\u2019t normally do. Doing some sporadic idea would make me feel better, even if it\u2019s for a short time. It\u2019s worth it.",

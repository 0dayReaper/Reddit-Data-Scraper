I just lay in bed all day and cry, and the only reason I haven\u2019t killed myself yet is because of my cat- who can\u2019t even live with me anymore because of my landlord. So I send my dad money to feed him.\nEverything is shit. I never brushed my teeth consistently for years and now it\u2019s fucking me. I\u2019m so ashamed my face is disgusting. My face I don\u2019t have the energy to wash and my teeth are getting yellow because I never have the energy to brush\n\nEDIT: thank you so much for all the beautiful replies &lt;3 I slept for a while and I made sure to read everyone\u2019s comments before brushing my teeth and washing my face this morning- baby steps&lt;3 I\u2019m so glad I found this r/.",

Please don't hesitate or be ashamed of yourself. Mental health can take a toll on self care and we understand that. I can assure you, once you see your teeth cleaned, you'll feel much better. But please don't think you're the worst patient we'd ever see. You're not. Nobody is. When we see an oral cavity, all we think is how we can restore it to it's glory, not how it came to be the way it is. Take care.",

They also lecture me to stop using drugs because it\u2019s deteriorating my teeth but I\u2019m so embarrassed about my depression that I keep letting them think I\u2019m on drugs. But I will say my dentist is SUPER kind and it\u2019s taken me years to find a good dentist like her AND overcome my dentist anxiety. I love it when she softly lectures me but then reassures me that I shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about my teeth and it\u2019s definitely not the worst they\u2019ve seen.  Thank you for being a dentist! And thank you for helping people who REALLY need the help :) \n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t know why but I can\u2019t brush my teeth consistently. I don\u2019t shower or change my clothes either, since I\u2019m severely depressed.

I try to change clothes at least weekly. What I find works for me is trying not to punish or push myself into hygiene, but being as gentle as possible and \"just doing it\". \n\nIf you can't do a full body wash, try taking it in shorter bursts.\nWash your hair one day, do a quick rinse with some cloth and soapy water etc.",

I'd go to sleep without taking off my contacts or brushing my teeth. My gums got to the point where they would bleed so easily I'd wake up with bloody teeth. And ugh... yeah don't even wanna describe but it looked bad. I neglected it for years.  Definitely go to a dentist... I finally went and they did a deep cleaning (two sessions, one for each side of my mouth) They numbed my mouth although it still hurt because my gums were so sensitive and there was.... a lot of blood...... but my gums are a million times better. I got a toothbrush with a timer now and will have to keep going to the dentist for periodic checks until my gums are completely healthy again but it's worth it. Definitely don't keep waiting until it gets worse. It'll be ok afterwards I promise. Mine don't bleed anymore and are healing fast.",

Her neglect of visiting the denist, plus smoking since she was 13 and partaking in alcohol until she was like 60 has resulted in her having had most of her teeth removed and getting prosthetics.\n\nIronically, she's always been better at brushing her teeth compared to myself (I brush on a good year maybe once or twice a month, 2020 has been a little better but I honestly wouldn't toot my own horn) and she's the one with the bigger dental problems. Yes, I neglect my teeth but I do see my dentist once or twice a year and have always been good about that.\n\nYour teeth getting fixed absolutely will make you happier.

After awhile, I started flossing here and there too. I finally went to a dentist, and my teeth turned out to not be nearly as bad as I thought they would be. Knowing this made me want to keep them nice, so now I floss 3-4 times a week and use a fluoride rinse in addition to daily brushing. It's been awhile since I've been so depressed I stopped brushing, but when that did happen, I tried not to beat myself up about it. Some progress is better than no progress.",

For showering/bathing and brushing teeth, growing up we could only have a bath once a week, which was usually a Sunday before the school week started and we had to share the water between me, my little brother and my mum. Of course my dad could bathe every other night so he could go to the pub and piss money up the wall.\n\nFor brushing teeth, well my mum would tell us you do it occasionally but would enforce it, only really encouraged us to brush them the day before and the day of dentist appointments. Didn't help that my mum told us how she brushed her teeth every day and lost them all by the time she was 15. When I was around 14, my gums started bleeding anytime I brushed, so I stopped doing it, because instead of trying to fix things that might go wrong, I run away and hide from them.\n\nAbout 4 years ago, I got an abscess and I ignored it for 2 weeks until one night I curled up into a ball on the bed and begged my girlfriend to kill me which got her to ring an ambulance. I had 17 teeth taken out that day. Been trying to mold and get dentures to fit since then, but it's like my gums won't accept them and will change size as soon as I put them in. \n\nI blame my dad for most things. He was a bully and was never satisfied with how well you did something. Instead of trying to fight for his approval like my older brother did, I did the opposite. If I failed at something, I never did it again and hid from it. To this day, if somethings goes wrong, I don't fight it and just give up. \n\nI'm only alive now because of my girlfriend and I don't have the courage to end it all myself. I was happy when I found out I had cancer last year, which soon turned into disappointment when the surgery was successful in removing it...",

I read this Tumblr post a while ago that said \u201canything worth doing is worth doing it poorly\u201d. And then went on to explain that some people aren\u2019t lazy, they\u2019re just perfectionists who would much rather not do the thing at all than to do it in a mediocre manner. It resonated so much with me. They then went on to give examples, like, if you feel like 3-5 minutes is too long to brush your teeth, just brush them for 30 seconds. If you\u2019re too tired to take a shower, just change your clothes; you get the gist. Now you\u2019re 100% better off than if you hadn\u2019t done it. \u201cAnything worth doing is worth doing it poorly, because doing it poorly is better than not doing it\u201d. I wrote that note and put it on my bathroom mirror. Little by little, you\u2019ll start to enjoy doing self-care. Remember that as a human being, you enjoy being clean, it\u2019s just your mental illness that makes you too tired to take a shower, or makes you think that you don\u2019t deserve it. Every time you brush your teeth, or are fresh out of the shower, try to remember how good that feeling of cleanliness is. You deserve that feeling daily.",

I have yellow teeth and receding gums and can see holes at the top of my teeth near my gum line, part of the reason is because I drink Red Bull like crazy to try to stay awake for work because of my mental health and it being physically and mentally exhausting. Showers are usually a few times a week but I\u2019ll sleep for hours after work filthy and depressed in my filthy room. It\u2019s a big issue for me as well that I can\u2019t find the energy to fix but I really want to.",

            "comment": "Many things are a vicious cycle with depression, caused by it, but then making it worse too.\n\nYou don't brush because you're depressed so you start having issues in your mouth.  Your mouth is right there in the middle of your face - there's no overlooking it, no missing it.  You eat with it.  You are constantly reminded not just of your failure to take care of your teeth, but of the broader causes of that failure - your depression.  The constant reminder makes you more depressed and less likely to address your dental issues, and so the cycle intensifies!  \n\nIt's hard to do but you MUST break the cycle on this particular issue, by changing your habits and getting professional help to address existing issues with your mouth.  This is not primarily about saving your teeth - that's important, but the point is to save you from the depression your teeth are making worse, because that can kill you.\n\nAnother commentator mentioned an electric toothbrush.  It's a little thing, but a new, effective toothbrush can really help trigger an improvement in habits!  Some of them have a feature where the toothbrush vibrates to let you know you've done enough brushing in one section of your mouth so you move on to the next.  \n\nSee a dentist and make a plan for getting you to a place of good mouth health.  It may not take as much time or effort as you think it will.  \n\nTake control of your mouth, and potentially you'll find yourself tackling some of the other specific black holes that are contributing to your depression - things like changing diet, exercise, sleep habits, unwise drug use, cleaning house, etc.  \n\nI'm here if I can help in any other way.",

It's not a fancy one. In fact it's a fairly cheap one. But it's pretty and made me happy. And I use it. So that's a win.\n\nI changed my toothpaste too. I didn't dislike the old one but it wasn't something I ever put thought into. I just bought the one my parents had bought when I was still living at home. Now I have my own brand. It made me FEEL like an adult (I'm almost 40 btw).\n\nFlossing is difficult bc of my crowded back teeth so I tried a different kind of floss - dental sticks I think they are called. It's a small amount of floss on a plastic pick that made changing angles easier for me.\n\nI also purchased some really cheap containers that I thought were pretty to out the dental sticks into and to out the mouth wash I decided to use. For me this was a tiny thing to do that had a huge benefit - I enjoyed the pretty containers and that helped me to USE the products.\n\nOnce I had the products, I treated myself like a 5 year old child - as in, I gave myself a schedule for doing the thing. Brush and rinse every morning. Floss, brush, and rinse every night. And then I was kind to myself when I missed my scheduled time. I didn't want this to become a negative thing.\n\nIt took months and months but it's become such a habit for me that now when I miss a flossing, I find that my teeth/mouth feel uncomfortable because I enjoy the clean feeling.\n\nI also have a couple tips for face hygiene that have helped me tremendously. Some sort of process in changing up products but I want to share a specific tip that has helped the most.\n\nI keep a pack of wipes (it started off as baby wipes, then eventually became specific face acne wipes with time), next to my bed. If I didn't wash my face before going to bed, I'd use a wipe to get the oil and surface dirt off while I was in bed.\n\nThis allowed me to do the \"bare minimum\" and not have to get up and go to another room. \n\nAs a sub tip for this - keep a trash can with multiple liners already in them to out the wipe in when you are done with it. This is key bc at one point I found myself surrounded by old wipes. Now, I can out them in the trash, again without having to get up. And once the liner is full, I take out the top liner, tie it up and toss it by my door to take with me in the morning on my way to get a cup of coffee. And because the can has other liners already in it, I don't have to get up to reline the can!\n\nI hope these help you even if you don't use them specifically. Maybe they can just show that there are many ways to encourage yourself to do the thing that you want to do.\n\nI hope you can learn to be kind to yourself and show your inner child the love you deserve \u2764\ufe0f",

It was really bad and I was so depressed that I didn't have the energy to take care of it (washing my face, sheets, etc).\n\nEventually, at 24, my mind clicked and I told myself I was done. I went to a dermatologist, got on accutane, and poof it was gone after a 7 months. It cost me a pretty penny for the appointments and the medication but I would say it's the best money I've ever spent in my life as my mental health has gone through the roof since then. Even if it's just going to the dentist to get whatever fixed, the benefits are well worth it compared to the cost (if that's an issue for you). It may even jump start the motivation to take care of your hygiene moving forward.\n\nJust my two cents, and best of luck to you!",

They helped me take showers and took me on walks around the hospital once i got better at walking, but the one thing they didn\u2019t do, was make sure I brushed my teeth. They gave me a toothbrush and never made sure I was brushing them and my parents were too caught up in what was going on to even think of that. \n\nAfter I got home from the hospital, I still didn\u2019t have the mental capacity/memory to even think to brush my teeth so I ended up getting 4 root canals, 6 teeth pulled and 3 cavities filled. I brush them twice a day now and floss. My memory is pretty good now and my brain is pretty much back to normal. I\u2019ve also been clean for almost 3 years. \n\nI know what it\u2019s like to be depressed and have crippling anxiety. Those are the reasons I starting shooting dope.

I needed up getting braces which pushed me to brush my teeth everyday because I had too and I really hated braces.  I recently just got them off and cleaning my teeth is much more complex as I have small wires at the back of my teeth and have to floss now. I've never flossed before and I hate it.  I find myself telling myself again to just do it tomorrow but it's really important that I do it all the time. It takes time and you just need motivation. After you get into the habit you start to feel fresher.  It's worth it.",

Me HATING peppermint didn't help (I feel more gross after brushing because of that damn taste, eww) I sometimes still forget in a weekend where I don't need to leave the house... But during the weekdays it goes well. Most of my teeth are partially fake now however though Idk for sure if my teeth are truly that bad... I switched dentists a few times who had different opinions and this all started when I turned 18 (means they can milk money). And no matter how well I brush, my gums keep bleeding... But that could be hormonal or stress related, even lacking certain nutrients can cause that. And ehh, fixing teeth makes them weaker actually, some holes were filled where I wonder if they were even there...",

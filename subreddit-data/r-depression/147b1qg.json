    "postText": "i (16f) started having a sort of situationship w a guy (19) in october last year when i was 15. illegal ik but hear me out. \r  \n i've been homeschooled since 4th grade bc my parents won't let me go to school and i had recently lost my best friend of 11 yrs who was all i had pretty much. i have very strict overprotective parents and was not allowed to do anything. no social media, nothing. i was dual enrolled and taking a college class which is how i met him. we were texting for a while and i decided i was gonna get snap behind my parents backs. i guessed my dad's password for the parental controls and got it\r  \nabt a week after things w him progressed he said he needed space after literally manipulating me into \"choosing\" to be w him. this crushed me and i turned to drinking to cope. this quickly became an addiction to the point where i was drinking thru 8am classes. i could drink liquor like water. \r  \ni got to a very dark place and started cutting. there was a point where he told me how to do it and not get caught \"do it on ur legs not ur arms, it's easier to hide\" but then later threatened to kill himself if i didn't stop. he was always very toxic and controlling, accuse me of things i never did, get upset bc i wouldn't let him go thru my phone, answer and talk for me, etc. nothing was ever his fault and everyone else was always the problem.\r  \ndepression got worse and i turned to drugs. he would constantly threaten to off himself but would never go thru w it and it seemed like it was just to play w me. i was high every day pretty much overdosing almost every time to the point of blacking out and/or slipping in and out of consciousness and struggling to breathe. he basically turned me against most ppl and made me feel like he was the only one who cared abt me. he had me so twisted that if i had a gun to my head and he said pull the trigger i would've done it. it was \"do what i say bc i told u to and if u don't listen or u disagree imma kms and it's ur fault.\" he would wait until i was crazy high to the point of not knowing wtf was going on and in no logical mind, literally saying word salad and ask me for nudes. \r  \ndespite that there were so many good times. when i finally got myself out of bed and took a real shower for the 1st time in a week he told me how proud of me he was. he talked me out of slitting my wrists for 1 1/2 hrs. he would tell me its all gonna be alr over and over. he let me cry in his arms. i miss the person i met and the person i fell for but not who he rly was. and it's so hard bc i have a case against him rn and haven't talked to him since my near fatal OD in jan. but i miss him sm. like i find myself constantly in a daydream imagining i'm w him and everything's great. i can't cope w reality so i make my own type shit. i'm zoning out to the point of nearly falling over. dreams, nightmares and it's so hard to deal with and i feel horrible for missing him but i rly did love him.\r  \nthoughts?",

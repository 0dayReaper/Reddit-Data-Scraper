    "postText": "it\u2019d be nice to be told/reassured that i\u2019m not a terrible person for feeling the way i feel. i know when i\u2019m depressed, i block myself off from other people, and i know it\u2019s bad. i don\u2019t want to be a burden, and i don\u2019t want them to get tired of me being depressed all the time, but i know ignoring them and being quiet makes them feel bad in return. this then makes me feel like a horrible, bad person. i know that i can\u2019t help it, and that it\u2019s my brain being chemically imbalanced, but fuck man. it feels so bad i can\u2019t stop crying or having my brain play on loop all the things i hate about myself. \n\nso maybe just one random compliment or nice statement out of the blue from someone would feel nice. i feel so left out most of the time at work, which i understand i\u2019m not very outgoing or particularly interesting or funny in comparison to other coworkers. it reminds me of high school.\nthis rant is kind of mixed i\u2019m sorry, i just need to write my shit out right now before i explode for realz.\n\nthank you to anyone that read this and i hope you\u2019re okay.",

Try to express before others what you truly feel. It will save a lot of disappointment later on. Those who truly understand you , will not make you fee embarrassed.",

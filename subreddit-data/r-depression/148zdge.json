    "postText": "I'm  like super depressed.. I was living on the brink  and I could feel it coming but I was able  to manage  it... i moved which I just got fucked over  on everything... no support  or help and then I lost my job.  Then I found out the guy I was so in love with was just a huge piece  of shit. Then my daughters  father  keeps  fucking tormenting  me... and I'm  just feeling extremely  fucking  sad, overwhelmed and debilitated... I'm having such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning and just being functional... and I don't want to be a burden  to my friends  just trauma dumping.... I've been taking walks/ hikes and  I feel as much at peace when I'm in nature... but truth  be told  every  cliff and ledge I pass I imagine  just throwing  myself  off of it just to end it all. I've been thinking  about committing  suicide  a lot recently.  And it scares  me. It scares  me how  much I cry, how much I struggle  to care for myself.. how little I've eaten recently.  How much comfort I've found in alcohol.. I'm  so afraid of failing... I've  worked so hard over the last few years  to rebuild  my life.. and here I am still not where I want to be.. and feeling like I've  hit rock bottom AGAIN and I just don't know if I can get back up. I'm  trying  to focus  on bettering  myself and educating myself and finding more purpose and living more intentionally.. but when I look at myself who I once saw a beautiful  confident  woman  I now see this disgusting  person  I don't  think any man would want to be with.  I feel so lost. And I just don't  want to do this anymore.",

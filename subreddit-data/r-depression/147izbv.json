    "postText": "I(20M) have allergies, biggest allergy being pollen allergy. It's extreme in my condition. I walk with a mask/sunglasses outside and am still getting sick of it. I can't sleep in the night (mostly due allergy problems). I used to have a routine where I sleep early and get up early go to the library/gym etc. Now it's just surviving, being sleepy with no energy all day. I can't do anything efficiently. Medication won't help, it makes me more like a zombie(less energy) and the symptoms barely decrease.  \nJust wanted to write it out.",

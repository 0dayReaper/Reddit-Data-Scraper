    "postText": "I read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible.\n\nFrom an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape.",

            "comment": "This would be called Persistent Depressive Disorder. I am not diagnosing you BUT I say look into it. This is exactly what I was diagnosed with along with C-PTSD. \n\nAnd it sucks because I feel like I\u2019m not sick enough. Sure I may go days without showering and brushing my teeth. I have crying episodes and I self-harm. Suicidal ideations totally there. But I also go to school. Go out with friends. I have good grades and pass all my classes. And like you, I feel like I\u2019m living a double life. \n\nThere\u2019s been this desire in me lately. One of just escaping. Either through death or through moving to another state. But there\u2019s just this intense desire to get away. And I think that\u2019s where it stems from. I won\u2019t lie, I suffer from an identity crisis. I genuinely don\u2019t know who I really am. I\u2019ve spent my whole life conforming to everyone\u2019s standards just to please them. \n\nAnyways OP, I hope you\u2019re able to overcome this to whatever extent possible. We all deserve a chance at true happiness.",

I have been in a new country for a year now and I am already thinking of where I\u2019ll end up after my short term contract is over.\n\nI can\u2019t really stay more than 6 months/1year at the same place because it\u2019s pretty much how long it takes for me to realize that i am still the same unhappy person wherever I live.\n\nMy mom told me that I was going away for the wrong reasons because \u201cyou can\u2019t escape yourself\u201d. \n\nBut it does help to be away, sometimes. It has a price though (I left a lot of things behind).",

Your dreams? Your ambitions? \n\nIt might seem overwhelming at first, specially for someone who is as lost as I used to be, and the process is very slow, but it gets going sometimes without you notice it. \n\nA key factor for me was a desire to learn new things. I kept learning a bunch of things throughout the years and eventually find some things I was actually passionate about. I started to change my habits and my way of thinking because of the knew knowledge acquired. I found things and people that inspired me and started to copy their behaviour. \n\n2 things helped me a lot. Art and philosophy. Through art I found some of the most beautiful things I have ever witnessed. No matter the form; music, movies, video games, literature, etc. I always found wisdom and understanding to whatever I was going through. I always tell myself that music saved my life.\n\nPhilosophy introduce me to a whole new world. A very complicated one, but also one that helped me rationalize my struggles and gave me the words to actually describe what I was going through. It gave names to my fears, anxieties and insecurities and also pointed me the way to great works of thought of people who have already analyzed those things before. It gave me guidance for my messy thoughts. There's a great channel on youtube called Academy of Ideas. It's a great introduction to philosophy. \n\nHope this helps and good luck.",

Actually, I've gone from art, to athletics, to the factory, to business, and back to art in my life-- so the question of identity has plagued me my entire adult life. It seems like the whole history of philosophy has never been able to give a sufficient answer. The question of being has always been that \"being is\" with varying opinions on the subject.  The philosopher Wittgenstein thought that some questions were unanswerable because we were trapped by language. The very thing with which we ask the question is the confounding substance of any answer. Anyway, I have always thought Wittgenstein was on to something. Actually after discovering him  I stopped asking the question myself and decided to live without answers, and those have been my happiest periods. I think he also helped me to adopt a more stoic attitude towards my own traumas and depressions. That is to say  I see them as \"things that happened to me.\" I have found solace from some pretty heavy childhood traumas, which I can assure you were significant,  by understanding this shifting of perspective. \"Things that happened to me\"  lost much of their harm and became blurred in the line of \"things that continue to happen to me.\" Indeed, the idea that things shouldn't happen to me seems the irrational thing. Nor have I ever been convinced that dramatic \"re-experiencing\" is necessary or that backpacking excursions or group retreats are necessary to begin clearing a path for yourself, for a way to live. I know that who I am has something to do with love, with a sense of justice, with a desire to see happiness in others, with experiencing nature and even with my own mortality. With mortality in the mix, it is almost like the question \"who am I\" has been substituted with the question of\"who I am not,\" or \"who I was not.\"  And for that I have some pretty darn concrete answers which make me happy about myself. Anyway, thanks for your question.",

About 5 years ago I started sliding into a place I haven't seen since I was 19 and I can't seem to get out.\n\nI'm middle-aged, married, kids, successful educated professional in a high status (locally anyway) job. No financial problems, very little debt at this stage. Own my home. Nothing from the outside looks bad.\n\nBut inside I'm hollowed out. It's all rusted gears and rot, like the guts of an antique clock you keep around just fpr show. \n\nAt work, I continue to perform. I still take on the big projects that they think they need me for. I still get results, get compliments, win promotions. At home I screw on the mask for my children. I've tried to tell my wife what's really going on inside me but she doesn't/can't/won't understand. She just tells me I need to go out with friends more and find a fun hobby. Thing is: I do go out with friends, but it exhausts me trying to be sociable when all I want to do some days is die. I *have* hobbies, but I can't enjoy them because they just frustrate me when things are bad and I end up feeling worse.\n\nNot every day is completely bad. Sometimes I can fake it long enough to push through and actually experience some fun, some happiness, but then I need to deal with the crash I know will come after.\n\nBut the bad days are really bad. Yesterday I faked it through an important meeting and then locked myself in a meeting room and fought down the sobs for half an hour. Lately self-harm has been back on the table. Sometimes I'll move through hours feeling like I'm trapped in amber or it's all unreal. Totally dissociating, I know.\n\nAnd this is me on meds and with a counsellor.",

If people are rewarding/affirming a facade you put on to protect yourself and others, the \"other you\" feels even shittier and unable to come out of hiding.

When you take away what everyone thinks (gj you have a good job, you're \"doing well\" in life) and ask him why he's actually unhappy it could be two things: a chemical imbalance in the brain (definitely possible, although the likelihood of such a brain malfunction is probably not very high) or that he is doing things for others because he thinks that is good.\n\nWhy else would everyone praise him, but he himself sees no value in the things hes doing? His facade as he eloquently puts it makes him believe that that is what people like him for. \n\n'Genuinely don't know why people like me'. He's so good at pretending at being someone he believes people will like that he can't even identify if that's actually him anymore. All of this points to him doing things for others instead of himself; I get it because I was the same way. When you stop trying to please others and ask yourself what you really want, you realize you aren't a fake anymore, because you're doing things for yourself.",

So when you go home at night all of those doubts about yourself come rushing out after a day of interacting. You need to work on your self esteem, as do I. You obviously have a lot of ability and you are capable, but you need to have a good self esteem base and love yourself to get through this and move passed hating yourself and what you do. There are. Lot of self help books out there and talks that people have given on this. Not sure if youve looked into anything like that, but you really should. You need to learn to remove the negative self talk.",

At the end of the day when I walk out the door I just feel my face drop because I\u2019m so tired of being.\nThere\u2019s been days I get home from work and just bawl for no reason.\nA handful of days might be a manageable, light-feeling time but I\u2019ve learned to expect at least a couple of days where I wonder hard about why I\u2019m alive.\n\nI manage to shower everyday and I pay my bills on time. I have a spacious suite and a small companion as my friend. I look presentable and clean. But I do slip up which I\u2019m ashamed of. I have troubles keeping up with laundry after I clean it so I just have a pile. Sometimes the insomnia gets me and I sleep in and arrive late to work. Moments at work find me trembling noticeably to others.\nSo far I have always found myself back together again though. So far.\n\nI\u2019m trying to remind myself to have hope, and to be grateful for what I have- even the work. The Hope helps in the darker moments.\nWe got this far and we deserve to be brave.",

I read on other comments that you often change your places of work - I\u2019m college student so, I don\u2019t have that possibility, but from 6 months - 1 year I always end up to be friends with completly other people than before. People like me, and I\u2019m always nice to everyone + hardworking, my family is really supportive of me and I have huge amount of luck in my life. My apparence it\u2019s not like 10/10, but thanks to my character mask I get some attention from opposite gender who supposed to be out of my league. But even though everyone likes me, I personally hate myself, and think of myself as someone weird and cringey. Never been in relationship, even if I had chance with decent boys, since I cringed that they liked me and ran away. When I have obvious shot with someone, I make myself think that it\u2019s all in my head, and I could never make someone take interest in me. Never truely liked any of my friends, even though they were amazing and felt guilty and sorry because of it. Got into dream college and felt numb, when I expected to be happy. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. Just trying my best every fucking day, but every minute I feel as someone worse from anybody else. And after achievieng my dream goal, not feeling happy but rather guilty that I could make even better.",

            "comment": "This was me before the depression became debilitating. You might be overestimating how long you can keep this up. \n\nI'm not saying I know what it's like for every single person with depression, but from myself and those around me, it usually starts off how you describe, living two separate lives, but holding it together enough to survive. And then, without help or proper care, it gets worse and worse to the point where you can't function, then you're really fucked bc things start crumbling around you and you can only just sit helplessly and watch it all collapse on you. So, now, not only have you become nonfunctioning, but you have this incredibly overwhelming task of trying to pick up the pieces of your entire life and put them back together. This is when most people admit they need professional help and it's better late than never, but it is so fucking hard to take those steps when you're lower than you've ever felt in your entire life. \n\nMy suggestion is getting professional help while you're able to stay above water if you haven't already. If you are getting help, you need to make it your absolute top priority. Preventive care sure beats the fuck out of diagnostic care.\n\nEdit: a typo",

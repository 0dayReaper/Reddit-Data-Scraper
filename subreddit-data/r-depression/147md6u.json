I never expected to be alive this long and now that I\u2019m here almost a quarter century, life doesn\u2019t feel real. I\u2019ve always been somewhat suicidal, I wished to never see my 24th birthday when I was 19 tbh but here I am. I don\u2019t have the balls to just off myself like that so I just drink and smoke my life away tbh. It feels nice when I do it and it makes me forget the bullshit. Truth is tho the bullshit is tough to run away from but I keep hoping one day ill get away from it or  beat it up so it\u2019ll leave me alone. I\u2019m killing myself slowly and no one around me knows it and they never will til I\u2019m gone or til someone I know sees this, I drink so much more than I should but it makes me happier than anyone sees me on a regular basis. I smoke to calm me down and I need to be calmed down more often than not. My silverlinings are killing me but I find peace in it. Reddit you are the only people to know this and I hope none of you feel this type of way, I love you all with all my heart and pray nothing but greatness for each one of you.",

            "comment": "I feel like this is a very common way to cope for many, many people to the point it has become normalized in our society and not many would consider that you have a mental illness solely because you engage in these activities. \n\n25 is not old. You could start from scratch and become a doctor (12 years with a fellowship) and still only be 37\u2026. Not saying you should, but I\u2019m saying you have plenty of time to master anything and STILL not even be middle aged. Therefore, you haven\u2019t failed anything as long as you keep trying. \n\nLack of purpose is a caveat that drives depression. You drink and smoke because you have nothing to do and don\u2019t value anything. It\u2019s hard to figure out what you want to do with your time, but certainly you don\u2019t want to waste it drinking and smoking the next 60+ years, because how boring?  \n\nI think about growing. Gaining skills and knowledge are most important. Learning an instrument, a language, to cook, to draw, to whistle, to sing, to ride a bike, to swim\u2026 whatever it is to be a little better than yesterday. I\u2019ve been heartbroken and it really crushed me, but you spin that sadness into inspiration to look better, communicate better, learn more, and do it better next time. Yes it\u2019s hard work. Yes it\u2019s tiring. But the funny thing is that nothing worthwhile comes easy and you wouldn\u2019t be proud of yourself if it did. Challenges better you.  \n\nSo my answer to you is hard work. Challenge yourself. Take risks. Do things you fear and that make you uncomfortable. You\u2019re sitting in a comfy puddle of booze and numbness, and clearly that actually doesn\u2019t make you happy or you wouldn\u2019t be here. As much as you don\u2019t want to hear it, get ready for life to get harder, because it gets worse before it gets better haha.. but it does pay off and you start to slowly see growth and gains. These are the endorphins that make your brain happier. You have to put in the effort or it won\u2019t happen. There\u2019s really only two options: try or don\u2019t (at literally whatever you want to do!). And I\u2019m sure you understand which one leads to being happier and which option doesn\u2019t.  \n\nDo what you gotta do for your mental health and take as long as you need, but realize you have to get back up and keep going at some point. Take a deep breath, and try again. You\u2019ll find something that ignites those good chemicals again. Everyone in life goes through these cycles. You are not hopeless! You have great potential!",

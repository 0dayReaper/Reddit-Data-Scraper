    "postText": "I\u2019ve been depressed since 12yrs old. It\u2019s almost become part of me by now, I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without it. Depression has become comfortable. I\u2019ve destroyed my own life and it\u2019s become normalised. I\u2019ve lost my friends, family and anyone else that matters to me. I\u2019m completely useless, I sit and rot away in my room every day. I continuously attempt to find joy within things that kill me. My floor is covered with patches of sick and stubs of cigarettes scatter across my shelves, I\u2019ve been told for years that it\u2019ll get better. When? And don\u2019t you dare say I haven\u2019t tried because I have, I spent so long forcing myself to complete normal everyday tasks just to end up back in the indent of my mattress. I\u2019m tired of being seen as a broken object to be fixed. I can\u2019t anymore.",

You'll have to force yourself to take care of yourself. Do things that you should enjoy even though you don't feel like it. If you keep going you will feel better. There's no cure for depression but, it is manageable. Hope this helps.",

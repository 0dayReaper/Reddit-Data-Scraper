    "postText": "Hello guys, I\u2019m sorry if I write this post bad but English isn\u2019t my first language. I will start saying that I\u2019m not even an adult. I\u2019ve been going through a lot lately and I\u2019ve broken down multiple times in this days, specially yesterday. I\u2019m not sure if I have depression at all, but I know for sure that I feel really sad. As I was saying, yesterday was a little hard for me. I found out that the girl that I liked for 3 weeks is back with her ex-boyfriend. This surprised me knowing that she hated him so much. I\u2019 having trouble crying, I can\u2019t really do it anymore. I need some advice, please. Thanks to anyone that will read and comment this post.",

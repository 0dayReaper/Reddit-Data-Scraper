    "postText": "I fucking can't. I'm reaching levels of abandonment that shouldn't be allowed. I have had some fucking sickness in my bowels and I fear it will turn into something serious because I haven't treated it in ten years. Nothing I do to get out of being chronically poor works and I can't even have a normal job because I have fucking autism or some bullshit. I speak three languages and counting, I ma willing to learn IT, informatics, coding, whatever. I have 16 years of experience as a tutor and I create the most professional looking advertising yet no one gives me the time of fucking day \n\nI'm full of ideas. When I was a kid and a teen people used to compliment how smart I was and even to this day I have easiness to learn new things. Fuck, I have an entire professionally looking Facebook page, a professional study program to learn languages in record time, the best strategies to make anyone understand mathematics but I'm still invisible. What the fuck should I even do. I don't even have money anymore to pay for Facebook advertising, and today I'm using my last $60 for that with the hope of getting something but I'm not catching anything so far. If this continues like that, I will not even be able to pay for my internet bills and then what the fuck will happen. I have no one but my family and they are equally broke as me. I'm a fucking disappointment. \"Brilliant\" but useless, I don't matter in the eyes of society.\n\nWhen I offer my classes for a literal one time payment of just $5 fucking dollars for a lifetime, they fucking flake dude. Like what is this fucking shit. I probably developed colon cancer at this point and I didn't get to do anything out of my life rather than surviving my entire life. I'm so fucking done with this shit.",

            "comment": "Hello, after reading your post I must say that you sound extremely intelligent. It's so impressive to me that you speak three languages, being a typical ignorant American, I only know English lol. Anyway, the reason I started this by pointing out your ability to speak three languages is simply to also say that there is plenty to be proud of about yourself from that alone! Reading your post, I found you to be more than impressive! You are clearly a talented person, so if someone as talentless and of average at best intelligence like me can find value in myself, then someone of your caliber surely can do the same! I want to be clear, you are definitely not \"a waste of matter.\" You are a person who is experiencing a lot of pain right now, and that is all. I'm turning 30 in September, I have quit so many jobs due to the fact that I have autism and tend to be depressive when things don't seem to be going the way I want them to go. I have tried many different jobs and left all of them after a short time feeling defeated and devoid of confidence. Last August, I finally found a job that I actually can say I enjoy. It took several years but I finally found something I like. If someone like me can do that, then you can definitely do it too! I know it may seem impossible right now, but try to give yourself some slack. You are experiencing constant pain in your bowels, you suspect you may have autism, and you are feeling a lot of emotional/mental pain as well. Basically, you are going through so much, but you are more than these things. You have things about yourself that you can be very proud of. I hope you can see that as well ASAP! Remember, reddit is always a place you can come to when you feel there's nowhere else to go.",

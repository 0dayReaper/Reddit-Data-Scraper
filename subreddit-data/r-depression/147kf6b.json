I'm ugly and no one wants me for that, I tried to lose weight but nothing changed. I tried to talk to people but no one wants me, I make them laugh but still they don't want me around. I have 0 interests, I had before, but now I feel like everything is pointless. I have 0 energy to doing everything. The only thing I do is playing with online friends, but every time I think about it gives me depression. \nI do exercise but still I can't outrun the fact that I'm alone.\nI just wanna die and I should do it, my parents hate me too so what am I doing in this world?",

    "postText": "Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.\n\nThe kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of \"you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there\", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.\n\nI've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.\n\nAnd with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.\n\nI wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.\n\nEdit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.\n\nEdit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all",

However, there are a couple of things I\u2019ve learnt in my (short) life that has helped me get through life being a queer person. It\u2019s 2:30am, so I\u2019m probably gonna not make sense, so I apologise. \n\nOne thing I heard a lot when my country was deciding to have same sex marriage was \u201cyour existence is radical\u201d. You being alive is radical and should be celebrated. You being here while most white Americans finally realise what you have gone through all of your life must be exhausting, but also is powerful. You being here while police brutality is shown by media with no regard to how that impacts black people shows that you are resilient. You existing during all of this is grand thing and shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. \n\nIf you need to take a break from things, please do. The one thing you need to worry about right now is you - these events can actually cause trauma, because the constant viewing of police brutality and the disgraceful acts of the police and the fear for your life and safety is traumatising. And to add depression into that, this period of time is very difficult for you. Allow yourself to be not okay (or whatever feelings you are feeling) and give yourself room to take care of yourself. Even if it\u2019s 10 minutes a day where you do something you enjoy, anything to actively feel better is a really good thing, or even 10 minutes to relax. I heard of an app called liberate that is a meditation app for BIPOC (black/indigenous/people of colour), it might help you. \n\nDoing something that helps you feel better IS doing good in the world. Also, the fact that you are talking about your feelings is a great first step. \n\nAlso, I hope that you know that if you need to talk about it or want resources that might help, I can always help you. \n\nYou are, and will always be, enough.",

When we practice meditation, it isn't the empty, zen mind that benefits us. It's the willful return to the breath, over and over again, without judgement that benefits us. That's where the brain training happens. Your mind learns how to let go of perseverating, obsessive thoughts. To recognize when it's lost in the storyline and come back to reality. \n\nWhen you realize you're lost in thought and observe the act of thinking with objectivity, that sense of agency strengthens the prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain that only humans have, allowing us to observe ourselves as observers and imagine ourselves in other circumstances). It makes us better at disidentifying from the stories we tell ourselves and the emotions that result.\n\nThere's a well known mediator (can't remember his name) who's known to be able to meditate for hours without a thought entering his mind. When he was interviewed, he said he always longs to hear a siren or a dog barking or something - anything to distract him and give him the opportunity to practice coming back. \n\nAnd remember, it's not the length of time that you meditate that's most important. It's the frequency. Even 5 minutes a day everyday is better than 30 minutes once a week.",

When I was a little girl, my mother took me out to fancy places to teach me how to behave, but what I really learned was anxiety and self-loathing. Anxiety that I would say or do the wrong thing and be publically humiliated by whatever white person was in charge. And self-loathing because no matter what, I knew that just being myself would never be good enough. And that anxiety and self-loathing has followed me my whole life. \n\nI understand the guilt from not protesting. But guess what? The murderers and the racists want us dead. Living another day is a protest all on its own. Do what you can as best you can to give yourself a little bit of peace and happiness. If it's speaking out against police brutality, do that from home -- write a letter, sing a song, or make a little sign and hang out the window. If it's taking a long, cool shower, do that. If it's just hanging out with your mom and ignoring the news for a little bit, do that! But try not to give up hope just yet. \n\nI just want to let you know that YOU ARE NOT ALONE. I don't know you, but I love you. We are all here for you. We are all in this together.",

They suck, and would legitimately make anybody upset.\n\nDepression could be making it feel even worse, it's an extra disease which doesn't even care about the rationality, people can be super well off and still get it. It likely makes all of these feelings far worse, going into what I now see as despair cycles, where you (honestly) look at all the problems that are very real, and get overwhelmed with despair and can no longer happiness. When in that state, I've found it's impossible to remember any joy, I'm convinced my whole life has been exclusively misery.\n\nIf possible, try to remember to make note of next time you're not feeling like absolute shit, make note of it as a moment which is real. Do it whenever you can, make a mental note in those moments. When depression hits, and takes your (real and significant) problems, where it doesn't let you experience the sensation of happiness and makes you believe all your happy moments were surely just self-delusion to cope, you might just remember that you made note of feeling good and have no reason to doubt yourself since you were quite clear on it, even if you can't recall the sensation of feeling good at that moment. It might at least help you not spiral so far into despair when these very real problems threaten to overwhelm you and make you believe your whole life is misery and only misery. Sometimes you can outsmart depressive cycles before they take your problems and only make you feel worse about them, sinking you into misery.\n\nYour problems are real, being sad about them is legit. But you may be able to fight the sadness at least and retain some happiness. Sometimes it's finding it in the smallest things. Having access to the Internet and maybe clean water is itself something that the wealthiest and most privileged of times past couldn't have hoped for, in many ways, even us schmucks who have to deal with this unequal world can have some parts which are quite lucky to get to experience, and being able to find happiness in perspectives can help save you from extra avoidable pain on top of the unavoidable pain.\n\nI'm angry at a lot of BS in the world, and still frequently sad at the realization of what dirt most of us are beneath the heels of some rich pampered inheritor assholes who run the world, but avoiding those despair cycles where possible might save you from feeling how you felt when you made this post, and might let you experience a bit more happiness.",

But finding small ways to appreciate what legitimately and logically should be appreciated has helped deal with parts of it. Essentially it's about learning to shrug and say what will be will be where possible and you've done your best, and hey look here's some things which are actually pretty damn good in context. It's only my way of trying to reduce the bottom of the almost manic response to all these negative things, to at least make the problems more tolerable.\n\np.s.

Then I kept doing it, only a few times. When sad, I can't remember the feeling, but I can remember the moment, and realize depression is playing tricks on my mind, and usually at least stop the despair cycle and just put the current unhappiness (which is all I can really feel) aside as a hindrance to not worry indulge, like your foot sometimes twitching for a moment due to an injury or condition, just riding it out as something which happens instead of panicking or even thinking about it much. Depression is just a weight some of us will always have to carry around, and the problems are real, but despair cycles might be something we can do something about much of the time by having noted things which contradict what they say.\n\nHonestly though the stress you're going through right now is pretty extreme, it's probably not the most likely time you'll find much happiness to note.

I'm not saying racism doesn't exist, I'm saying the way people deal with it can be unhealthy.\n\nLike the idea that you have to work twice as hard. I was always told by my abusive parents that work was soul crushing and they could only get through it thinking of me and my siblings, but they as I said, were abusive. It instilled in me the idea that other things were more important and work was miserable and it became a self fulfilling profecy and contributed to my depression. Even if my parents had to deal with real poverty and racism, it doesn't mean they were coping well.\n\nJust because you're black and people are lashing out at some people's silence doesn't mean you have to endlessly endorse the right politics or even be informed. Do so at your own time and contribute what you can while keeping your sanity.",

Like there is so much going on right now and I am being selfish for turning away from that battle and essentially ignoring it.

However, when you're beaten down by society, racists, and even by your own people, it can get very hard. Please don't give up on yourself. There are other people like you, who look like you, who deal with the same struggles, who feel the same pain. They want to see you succeed. I want to see you succeed.\n\nI am a black person who struggles with mental illness, so I understand your pain. I also know that there are people who want to help people like us. Find those people and let them help you. Find little things that make you happy. You deserve happiness, I'm rooting for you.",

I am south Asian, living in Europe.I wasn't suicidal when I was a kid, but I am now, sometimes.I haven't recovered yet and it's been a rough couple of years and looks like it will go on.\n\nI feel like I have seen both sides of oppression. I am semi-privileged in my home country, which means you experience oppression and you are oppressing others simultaneously while being complicit in a system that refuses to change. I have experienced low self esteem, and low confidence as part of this childhood, while simultaneously getting the easy way out in some situations because of being born in a certain group.Being non-white in Europe has been an education in itself as I saw the 'white superiority' in reality that was a just concept to me before. I have been in situations that made me feel incredibly shitty  about my own existence...about the body I was born in, and the colour on my face. And I have come to understand,clear as day, the oppression that my black brothers and sisters face is far more polarised, and far more intense than what I had experienced. I am truly sorry the world is the way it is. And Black Lives Matter. I cringe to think that this racism had led us all to subconsciously and consciously programmed us to what is considered cooler, better, or safer and what isn't. As a an South Asian, our culture too promotes whiteness, and I wish that was not the case.\n\nI have terrible depression and anxiety and a possible brain condition that causes it.In the past couple of years, I have stopped being vocal on social media, stopped speaking out against even stuff I do care deeply about. I was and am still broken inside. A few months ago protests broke out in my country(against facism), and I couldn't bring myself to participate -- the cause was definitely something I believe in. But I was not prepared or strong enough to face consequences. I couldn't bear to hear words that were not supportive, to be abused at or being hurt in the process. And now with the pandemic, I am scared of going out. And so even though the BLM protests took place in my city, I didn't go... I am angry about all this and am so exhausted to be angry about it. You deserve a better world, a calmer, more equal world and it is okay if you claimed that peace in your own house even if that is not available to you outside.\n\nTo not protest made me guilty, because fundamentally, I believe strongly in equality, in justice. To not speak out seemed hypocritical of me. I coped with those feelings like this: and it helped a bit. I am out of a job, so I volunteered at a hospital, to assist out-patients to the respective departments for a couple of hours every week. It didn't seem like much....but believe me, it took a lot of energy, I was already exhausted at this point. Many patients were old, some were lost and I just did the bare minimum of speaking politely, smiling and taking them where they wanted to go. This was my fight. This was all I could do to add value to my life. There were many days that I couldn't do this -- the 'bad' days when I needed to stay home. It wasn't an easy process to let go of the guilt. But don't be guilty....you taking care of your mom, you helping out neighbours is a kind thing to do, you are doing it at a time of a pandemic, and a crisis. That itself is a fight...against everything evil.\n\nI see it like how a family functions: If a member is ill,  they stay home. Others do the house work. You take your rest...you need it. Your family is out there doing the protesting, and you can join in ways that you can. \n\n Sometimes when people say ,'you are valuable', it is hard to see the truth in it. But  you have more value than people who don't see the injustice in this system, people who are racist, people who refuse to see the violence, people who spew hatred online...That is why your existence is a fight in itself,  as many people here have put it.\n\nYou seem a kind soul, and kindness is a weapon in itself. You are protesting in your own way, we all are, when we choose love and kindness to show others...even when times are difficult, even in something as simple as a reddit thread.\n\nSending out hugs and love!",

One thing that has helped me is my relationship with God. I know it's not for everyone but it truly brings me comfort. God is love. It's the one thing in my life I always felt void of. Nothing could fill it except my faith. I'll pray for you.",

I can't fathom what it is like to be black in this world, but I know very well the feeling that you have to 'work twice as hard as anyone else' to be on top of things and be accepted. \n\nHang in there ,you have a lot of people on your side, dear. &lt;3",

I can't promise things will get easier but I can say that you have more power than you know. The fact that you're experiencing all that pain and are still here is proof. Stick around because Lord knows we need your perspective to help make sure the next generation doesn't go through the same. Keep on, brother.",

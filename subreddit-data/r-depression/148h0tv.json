    "postText": "I'm 33 now. When I was almost 13 I started having seizures and I've been one cocktail of meds or another ever since. Sometime between then and now is when it started. The emptiness. Hopelessness.\n\nI don't know if it was the seizures, what they took from me, or the meds. Something between then and now broke me. I'm bringing it up to my neuro to see if maybe it's something we can treat by changing my current cocktail . I just want to go back. Wish me luck, my appointment is tomorrow.",

            "comment": "Almost all seizure meds that I've been on say they can cause depression. I would recommend talking to your neuro and seeing what they say. They should definitely be able to try out some new meds. I'm switching mine up due to other things such as kidney problems, and they never had an issue with switching. (Currently on trokendi xr and the generic vimpat).",

I've used to take aptiom as well, but it didn't work for me. I've also never heard of lyrica. I would discuss switching off Keppra and see if that works. If not, try getting of vimpat as well. (You may have seizures)!! That's a risk switching and anti epileptic med",

Been on keppra the longest, since probably 2005, so that's the most likely culprit. I'm willing to put up with a few more seizures during the switch if it means I get rid of this numbness afterward.",

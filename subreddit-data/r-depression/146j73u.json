    "postText": "Every time I try to open up, I'm told I'm too happy to be depressed. I fake a smile so people don't worry, but I'm losing myself more and more. I have a good life. I get exceptionally high grades in school. I have good friends. Why isn't it enough? I should be happy but I'm numb. I'd like to throw myself in front of a car but I'm to pathetic to even try. My life is just endless replay from day to day. I'm on autopilot and somehow I look happy. I should be better. Why can't I be better?",

I had a friend who committed suicide and no one had a clue what he was going through because he was so happy all the time. \n\nLife is repetitive, I struggled with depression for years until I realised this (meds also helped). The trick is to work out what makes you happy. You said you get good grades in school - but does this matter for you or are you just motivated enough to do well? If it doesn't really matter to you then no matter how good your grades are, you'll still feel poos about it. However, thinking long-term, those good grades will contribute to getting a better paying job, which will allow you to do/buy the things that bring you happiness. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is life is repetitive and boring. It's very easy to get caught up with the routine. But it doesn't have to be like that. It takes a lot of digging, but you need to work out what things (even if they're little) make you happy, then use the boringness of life to provide you the opportunity to enjoy those little things in your spare time.",

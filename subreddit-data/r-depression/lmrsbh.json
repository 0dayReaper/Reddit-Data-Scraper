I'm in a little house with a wood-burning fire place, in a comfy chair with a kitten in my lap. I'm watching TV and enjoying the fire. It's thunderstorming outside. I have plans to have lunch with a meetup group that weekend. Maybe I have a low-stress part time job in an office and my co-workers are fun. We go to the local pub once in a while after work. Just think about how your life could be different, and know that some day soon, you can have that.",

Last time I simply switched my schedule so I could get more hours and have the same shift every day but then it took two months for the anxiety and vomiting to stop being so severe.  Ended up getting fired because they refused to acknowledge my call in. Now it's all over again. But I didn't have any anxiety or vomiting or nausea those two months I was unemployed at home.\n\nI've tried anti nausea medicine that makes me sleepy so I took it before bed, so that helped me sleep through the night, but it wasn't  100% I've also tried a crap ton of weed, but if my anxiety is at that level already I don't feel it. So mostly I shake my leg as I lie in bed to distract myself as I wait for it to stop because eventually I'll get too hungry thst my hungry pangs cancel out the anxiety/nausea, but if I dont eat in this window I'll start vomiting nothingness from my stomach because of the hunger. This has been going on for a good decade now that I'm 27, I've learned to read my body, but I've struggled keeping a job.",

I've struggled taking my anti depressants cause they don't effect me so I just don't. I ran out of the anti nausea pills but my SIL has some I can have. I'm trying to put myself through school so I can have a nicer job in editing to work from home as my solution to put an end to this. I was dating a long term boyfriend and we were going to have a nice homestead,  but he didn't like the person I became when I shaved my hair.

It's certainly valuable, but the search for a therapist can be long and trying. The more people require it, the more the system has to adapt to the influx.  \nI'll profess to being a bit of a pessimist on the matter, but where I am it felt like a similar situation as was portrayed in Joker (2019). Feeling a little stuck in the system, and every interaction with it is a stark reminder of what kind of \"sick\" I am. That'd all be fine if there was some observable progress. Still can't seem to handle an ounce of stress before feeling like I'm drowning on dry land.  \nMy sister extols the value of a good therapist. So, I just hope you get a good therapist who \\_listens\\_. And if not at first, that you keep looking.  \n\n\nIn any case, it sounds like you have some real light at the end of the tunnel there to keep moving towards.  \nCan't imagine how shaving one's hair changes a person, but even if it did, that's a disappointing turn of events (I personally admire the shape of a person's cranium :P). That's the world now. People swayed by emotions that overshadow their social responsibilities. Communication seems to be a dying art.  \n\n\nIt does make sense. Make yourself feel better. We can't, however we may be inclined to with the dispositions that afflict us, outsource the responsibility on others to make us feel better. I hope there are regular moments where you are able to remind yourself that you're already doing a great job in the pursuit of this goal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll the best!",

I never realized how \"effective\" of a bad coping habit it was until now. So much shit was going on, I felt fulfilled at the end of the day. Like, fuck. Yeah, I'd think about all the bullshit I was dealing with when I closed my eyes and constantly how great death seemed but I also knew, I'm fucking living a life. Now, I'm a normal person doing normal shit and I'm still depressed. I do things that are good for me now. I've never been healthier in practice but I've never been more depressed. \n\nI genuinely think I'm depressed *because* I've been walking the narrow line. Like, I've taken everybody's advice and it fucked me by turning me into a fucking potato with eyes that requires food, drink, room and board, and busy work to keep it from jumping into boiling grease and disturbing the other potatoes.\n\nI just need a hectic life-changing adventure every weekend, but like that shit can go sideways and my social anxiety has always been so bad that I can't go out and do anything without wearing a blank face guise unless I'm under the influence (benzos if it's a choice but all I care about is functioning, and there are a lot of drugs that remove anxiety through different methods). I legit need medication and I'm prescribed it now, but I have to see my psychiatrist for a refill and since the pandemic started, I have to do it by video call, which makes me even more anxious. So I just haven't. So I just can't do anything.\n\nWow. I should start taking my meds again. At least you have an impact on other people, lol. I wouldn't have written this if you hadn't made a post. That's something that helps me, anyways. Knowing that I have a positive effect on some people, definitely not my family, though, lol. But yeah, you've got that. A pile of dust just gives you allergies. You affect the world around you. I'd focus on making changes to your life that emphasize this. I'd also do a bunch of stupid shit other people wouldn't, so take some salt with my rant and two cents.",

A coma would be more acceptable. Worst part to me is not feeling suicidal- just a numb bio mass waiting to not be here anymore.",

Like that\u2019s literally the only thing that gets me through the day and makes me happy. But then after I eat that I feel so satisfied but also like absolute shit and I just want to go right to bed. It\u2019s like I can barely keep myself awake, no energy to do anything, no motivation, just want to sleep. This is not living, not even close. And it makes me even more depressed that I am wasting my youth doing nothing and sleeping all the time...",

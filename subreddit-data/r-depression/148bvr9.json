How fkin stupid is that?\n\nJust now I got beaten 100 percent and I start hitting my head and thighs as hard as I can. At the same time Im crying my eyes out and yelling. \n\nMy doctor doesnt care when i tell him about these symptoms. I feel like im actualy braindamaged.\n\nI JUST DONT IMPROVE, NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY OR HOW MUCH TIME I PUT IN. \n\nI am fkin braindamaged and I refuse to live like this. If i cant even achieve a certain rank in game, how the fk am i supposed to manage in real world\n\nI fucking hate myself",

It doesn't seem like an impulse thing if you're hitting multiple parts of your body, so maybe you just need to find alternative ways to channel your anger.\n\nA doctor might not be the most helpful person to help but it's odd they haven't referred you to a psychiatrist.",

Best part is no whiny git gud losers whinging at you every few minutes. Lots of the newer ones are multiplayer capable too so you can go back to gaming with others if you want...or not. Have to admit always playing solo now I don't miss the toxicity.",

Sandball, Anti-Stress-Ball, listen to calm music, watching calm videos. Animal Videos are calming me down lol. Maybe playing a chill Game. No man's sky was my life saver. \nAnd a rank say's nothing about someone or about the real life. I really hope you will feel better soon.",

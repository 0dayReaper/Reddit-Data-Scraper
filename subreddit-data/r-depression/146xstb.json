    "postText": "All my life I've only ever been kind to others, even people I don't like. I help everyone in need and I don't ask for anything return. Even knowing this fact it feels like I'm being punished for almost a year my life has took a turn for the worst. For almost a year now everything I've held dear to me has crumbled in my own arms. For almost a year now I've given up on living. Despite the fact that I've only shown kindness I've only ever been shown brutality and cruelness of this world. I've given up on the expression \"What comes\naround goes around.\" Because if that we're true than maybe I wouldn't want to feel like jumping off a bridge everyday. I've researched for these past few months how to crawl out of this stagnant state of depression yet I've found no answers none at all, I've tried talking with friends about it but they always say something like \"Just focus on yourself for a while.\" That doesn't work cause I already tried it. \"Spend some time with family or friends.\" Doesn't work either. It probably doesn't help either that I've been lonely for as long as I can remember and have an inescapable craving for intimate touch. So any sort of romantic solution won't ever be an option. I really have no idea what to do with my life anymore, it's just hopeless at this point.",

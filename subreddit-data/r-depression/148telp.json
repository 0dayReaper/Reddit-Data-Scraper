    "postText": "My heart aches so much every day and the sadness and loneliness often feels overwhelming. I feel like I\u2019m trapped in my own life and I can\u2019t change it or my reality and circumstances.\n\nI can\u2019t help but always remember some parts of the past when I once felt like life was worth living and that I had a light at the end of the tunnel. Something in life I could have that gave me happiness But after so many broken dreams, hopes, plans and lost people. My spirit feels broken. Sometimes I wish some things went differently in the past. Maybe then I\u2019d still have something to love about life now. And maybe I wouldn\u2019t be in constant battle with depression and my own mind all the time. All I wished for was a chance for things to go well without suddenly falling apart\u2026\n\n\nI don\u2019t really feel alive. I feel like I\u2019m wasting my years with nothing I could do right now but just vent out my feelings here every now and then. This life hasn\u2019t been very fair and I can\u2019t even blame anyone but me for being me\u2026",

    "postText": "I have known my ex (18m) since freshman and we're close with another. He has always struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts since I have known him. We stopped talking some time ago and reunited again and catches up. He still feels the same way but has told me he's given up on life and any professional help will never help him he's said. It hurts me to see him this way as I care for him and we've previously been in a relationship before so there is still that sense of care. I feel useless because there's not much I can do. I just wish there was a way to at least soothe how he's felt at least slightly because I know that he deserves so much more than he thinks",

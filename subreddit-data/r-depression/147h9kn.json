    "postText": "Well It\u2019s been 10 years since I had to man up and take responsibilities personally. Had my fair share of humiliation and misery, cried alone, faced more humiliation. But recently I\u2019ve caught myself feeling jealous about everyone\u2026 I\u2019ve been jealous about people\u2019s looks, jealous about their lives, jealous about people having more money to spend when I\u2019m paying back loans, jealous about my friends getting married, jealous of people\u2019s families, jealous of them having kids, moving on with life. It just feels like a new low\u2026 usually I\u2019m happy for people even though my life\u2019s been a mess. But this, even by my standards it\u2019s low\u2026 like really low\u2026 I\u2019m not wishing ill on them\u2026 I\u2019m just jealous because they \u201cseem to have\u201d everything I longed for in life. I\u2019m 26 \u2026I\u2019m just scared I will fail to turn my life around because I get tired\u2026 mentally and physically\u2026 I\u2019m scared because one day I feel I will not be able to get up and brute force my way through the day\u2026 just posting it \u2026 random midnight thoughts though",

No matter where I go I get mocked and told I'm weird. Whenever I'm in a social setting people don't seem interested in me or I get ignored. Always being told to try harder even though I'm trying as hard as I can.",

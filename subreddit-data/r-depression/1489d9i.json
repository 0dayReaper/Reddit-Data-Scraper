    "postText": "My life is done. I'm 23. I'm killing myself soon. I'm constantly depressed and angry. I have no friends. Literally none. I dont have a boyfriend, never have and never will. Constant pressure from my parents for everything. None of my accomplishments matter. All my life is is working a fucking shit job and rotting at home. That's it. No travelling, no going out, no laughing, not even talking. No one likes me or gives a fuck about helping me and they can see me declining. I've absolutely lost my mind. I feel like I'll beat someone up one day and end up in prison. My life is fucking over. \n\nI graduated with my Bachelor's today after working my ass off for more than 3 years and no one cares. Can't find a new job because I have fuck all experience in fast food and I fucking hate it. I'm never going to accomplish anything or amount to anything. I have no one to talk to. My mum doesn't understand any of my problems and just tell me \"there's worse things in the world\". My dad thinks im lazy for not studying full time and working full time, nothing I do pleases him. My brother doesn't give a fuck about me and it feels like I dont even have one because he's constantly going out with his friends and never even does anything with me. I only have my pets but they seem to not give a fuck about me either. \n\nI'm ignored, im invisible. I've lost all of my friends because they fucked me over or just stopped putting any effort in or found a partner/ someone better and no one likes me so I can't make new friends. I've never had a boyfriend because im ugly. I've turned into a mean, violent, narcissistic cunt. I have smiled in weeks. I haven't left the house in over 6 months. No calls, no messages. I just go to work for fucking nothing and come home and cry or just try to sleep so I can escape everything. I fucking hate myself, I hate my life, I hate everyone around me. I want to fucking kill myself so bad, I hope I get cancer or hit by a fucking car so I dont have to do it myself.",

Having friends is not always a good thing as some people just exist to take your resources through friendship.  \nThats great that you got your bachelor's! Cheers to that. Although that in today's world does not necessarily help, really. What helps is your self motivation.  \nFamily is sometimes just dismissive. It's pretty much a global problem bud.  \nYou're not invisible. Nobody is because they don't deserve to be. You're ugly? Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder bud.  \nI hope you dont get hit by anything or get any terminal disease. Thats 1 for 1. You hoping it'll happen, me hoping it wont. So it probably wont ;D. If you need a friend, I'm right here bud. I'm here if you need someone to talk to.  \n\n\nAll the best. :)",

People will miss you if you die, please I'm begging you, don't kill yourself.",

    "postText": "I've reached a point where I don't know what to ask for. I don't know what I'm looking for. I have things I want to have, but I need money to do so. A consistent income and I don't have that. I feel like I've passed the point of being able to have that for myself... I feel broken, I feel inept, I feel incapable of doing for myself. I feel like workplaces are even giving less chances to someone with so many gaps in their resume. Why are their so many gaps? Because I couldn't adapt. I might have a learning disability, neurodivergent in some way and never gained the tools or knowledge to figure out how to operate long term in work settings. I've screwed myself so much it seems, have to rely so heavily on the people around me and it's slowly but surely killing me... I don't know how I'm going to survive on my own",

            "comment": "First, we focus on basic needs. Relying on others is not ideal, but it is necessary right now. Because you need it. With that help, it might be time to start building the skills and qualifications need to survive on your own.\n\nA consistent income is possible for you. It will take time and effort, but it is possible. May I suggest that you only feel broken, inept and incapable? That these feelings are not only unpractical but actively hurting you? And that they should therefore be discarded?",

    "postText": "I am currently dating a girl with depression, for the past 6 weeks or so of our 8 month long relationship her depression has gotten worse and worse on top of that she is diagnosed with OCD with the parts of ROCD affecting her aswell, being in this rough patch has been hard on the relationship as she is not able to show me affection, I've suggested seeing a therapist but she says they are not easy to get and as well as she is afraid of the therapist telling her we should break up.\n\nThis has been hard on me as well since she can not show affection for me as much as she used to if not at all, i do understand this is because of her depression and rocd but as she says she will probably get better over time  but not guaranteed i am unsure if i am willing to feel this was for any more time.\n\nWe do try to talk about the topic but every time i bring it up she switches topic so i don't feel like we make any progress by talking about it, there have also been periods where i have felt down and she has not been able to be support me due to the depression and i dont understand what I'm supposed to whether i should just deal with it or what.",

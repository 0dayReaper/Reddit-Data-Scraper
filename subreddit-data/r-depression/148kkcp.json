    "postText": "This is vent (17F):\n\nI feel like I am living in a shadow or under a big dark cloud. I don\u2019t see how it can get better. I don\u2019t see how I can fix my OCD, my ED, my self harm. I don\u2019t even have a depression diagnosis but I feel so empty. I don\u2019t want to die. I feel like all the stress of uni applications, school grades is going to crush me. I don\u2019t know how I will make it to June 2024. I have cut on my lower legs up till now but I realised it\u2019s too visible so I just cut high on my outer thigh. I don\u2019t know what to do. I genuinely don\u2019t know how anyone can help me. I need antidepressants or somethings. I have \u2018reached\u2019 out to my friends but they are just teenagers they don\u2019t know what to do. I have told my mom about my self harm and she told me to stop and not to tell anyone. I can\u2019t start therapy until September but I don\u2019t even know how that could help. \n\nI feel so tired. I am dragging this weight on my back every single day. I literally get anxious over the smallest things. I try to be nice and kind to everyone but I feel like I just get treated like a piece of shit. I am so fucking disgusted with myself.\n\nThis is new low. I don\u2019t know what to fucking do. I feel like I am going to fail. I want to scream and cry. My OCD voices won\u2019t be quiet. \n\nI get sad randomly and feel like I could just shrink into myself. Even people talking too loud fucking scares me. \n\neven with all of this. I fucking smile everyday. I laugh everyday. I am putting up an act because I am too embarrassed  of my feelings. I don\u2019t even know if anyone could help me.",

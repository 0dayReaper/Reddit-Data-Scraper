I take 4mg of abilify a day but what I\u2019ve noticed is when I don\u2019t have anything \u201cto do\u201d then my depression kicks in. It usually kicks in in the form of \u201cbrain fog\u201d. If I have a busy day and stuff to do I\u2019ll be fine. But if I have a weekend day with not much planned it can be a struggle. \n\nAnyone experienced this?  Any ideas how to combat it?  I need to be able to just relax and be okay with the idea of doing nothing for a little bit I think at times. \n\nDoes this make sense?  Thanks y\u2019all. If you\u2019re reading this I hope you have a blessed day!",

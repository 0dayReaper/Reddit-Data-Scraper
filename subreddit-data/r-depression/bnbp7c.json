    "postText": "I just broke down. That just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out. I sat in my dark living room sobbing and trying to decide if I should write anything. Before I could do anything my cat came and jumped on me. He pressed his face to mine and I just snapped back. I\u2019m trying so hard to get better. I\u2019m glad my cat jumped on me. That sweet little guy saved me.\n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I didn\u2019t expect to receive so much kindness. For those wondering, I am currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for mental health and medication management.\n\nTo the few people who said hurtful things. My story may be \u201ccliche and boring\u201d but it\u2019s still my fucking life. It\u2019s my experience, I can\u2019t change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you. It wouldn\u2019t be real then. To those who told me to try again and that I\u2019m a failure. You don\u2019t have to tell me that. I know but I\u2019ve never been more happy to fail at something in my life.",

I know she wants to help me but she's frightened because my emotions are so erratic that she witnesses a lot of crazy shit. I usually just rage to myself. I guess all of my dogs have finally learned to ignore it until I get better when I lose my shit like that",

So when I see a dog I can potentially interact with, I get this happy fluttering in my stomach (even now as an adult lol). \n\n\n\nMy high school tutor had a little dog (she tutored in her apartment).\n\n\nI was full of expectation on my first tutoring day as I noticed a dog the other day when mom &amp; I met the tutor to set up schedule (lmao I was paying more attention to the dog, kept glancing at her). I open the door, and the dog comes to check out who's come, stares at me for a sec and just resumes to whatever she was doing. The tutor seemed surprised, she commented that the dog always barks, especially to new people.\n\n\nI always kind of 'wait' until the dog approaches me when I have the rare opportunity to hang around a dog. Even then I can't call or motion for the dog to come to me. Not scared, I just don't really know how to approach a dog. It's hard to explain\n\n\n\nOne day I came to tutor's a bit early so I waited in the other room. The dog came to me with a slightly wagging tail, I was super joyous inside, but I didn't make a sound, just timidly petted her head with this awkward pose, all fingers straight lol.  From then on she would almost always come to get my awkward petting when I arrived. That was almost 9 years ago..",

I also do and I take medication (Lexapro) and it has given me my life back. I still get sad and have hard moments, but I can get out much much easier. Please try a different psychiatrist. I had a similar experience of a really messed up doctor, then I waited 4 years and finally didn't want to die so I tried to go to another one. She was amazing. It's really important that you work up slowly to taking these medications. You'll know it's a good doctor when they say \"start slowly then take a little bit more\". Also, any doctor that isn't 100% proud of you coming to see them isn't worth it. Fire them and go to another one. Spend all your money. Money is no good to you if you're dead. Get a good psychiatrist. So much love and luck to you.",

Life is so very confusing at times for a young person influenced by society and what the real ideal for success is in life and what we need to do to feel happy and accomplished. After a lot of searching, internally and externally, through experiences that I have been fortunate to have and people that I have been fortunate to meet, I have come to this conclusion. If your studies, your current path for your future, your family, your friends, and all the factors around you in your life dont make you happy then say fuck them. This life is not meant for us to please other people and be a success in their eyes. You and all the rest of us on this planet have this unique opportunity to go out there and be unapologetically unique. Think of you enjoy doing, if there is nothing you can think of right now then consider something that might give you even the slightest amount of joy and latch onto that. Hold onto it for dear life and never let go. Chase that one goal that you have regardless of circumstances or outside opinion and give it your all. That is all that we can really do to make the most of this life. Jobs, the ideal family or future dictated by what you see around you are in my opinion not what make you. That is just my piece to you, and I know that you can do your best and achieve a joyous existence. This is all I have to offer for the moment, but I believe in you, and I believe that we will grow together to make the most of this life we are given. Just know that I love you and support you, from across the world.",

I hate myself very much and it's a vicious cycle. To try not to think of myself very badly but its not really working out. Honestly i'd most want to just stop existing if i could press a button... Sadly there is no button and if i killed myself it would make many people very sad and I'm not at that point that i don't care about that i think(at least not yet). But its creeping on. I gave myself till i turn 30 but that looks so far away id rather end it now honestly",

We love toxic shit. \n\nShe is not bad, just not good enough(or atleast with me) she has a stupid merry go lucky attidue and I am a walking aura of blackness and sorrow consuming everyone around me and another that touches me I absorb the light in their eyes and the hope in their pathetic soul as they attempt to scream but discover that existence is a lie and that something or someone is controlling them and their thoughts and they are nothing but mere puppets in a stupid game that they dont want to play.\n\nShe just doesn\u2019t act right or normally like how you would act to someone tell you they will kill themselves and leave you a letter, I look at this and say what if she said that to me, oh my god I think I might hug her for the rest of her life not to do that, and I didnt get a response even which means I am not worth her time.\n\nShe cant find someone else to talk to I guess so she keeps coming back, and same with me.\n\nIf I find someone better That shows actual love and affection like any normal human will(not necessarily partner just really good friends would be really good) I honestly dont think I would give 2 fucks about what happened, cuz I tried my best and kept my cool, dealt with shit professionally, was forgiving and didnt look back, saw forward and she didnt realize that.\n\nI can say that I have wasted my time, but I did learn, I gave my time to the wrong person, and I wasnt worth their time.\n\nSo you leave.",

I guess I don\u2019t even know what is \u201cbetter\u201d anymore.\n\nI think the best thing is to kill myself, no one gets hurt. Quick and fast solution and if a stray dog does. Do the gods cry over it? Do humans grief over it? Do the dogs and wolves sing and howl in remembrance of their dead kin? Do they all find solace? \n\nI am sure they don\u2019t do all that, the gods keep the world alive and humans forget, and the dogs and wolves grow hungry by the day.\n\nIf I end it, no one is gonna care. And if they care then fuck them I don\u2019t, I only care about this girl.\n\nI swear if anyone sees her, you will see this aura she has, if she walks it seems like springs follow her. Stage and deers gallop in happiness, birds sing songs of joy, flowers bloom as she passes by, water flows so smooth you could think of it as silk and fire calms like she can control it, I could swear she glows so bright I don\u2019t even know what she looks like.\n\nAnd I follow her, the flowers wither and die, and birds fly, the stag and deer run for dear life, water stops and turns to ice and fire and storms rages, so thunderous you could feel the hate, I could swear I absorb the happiness and light in this world, eyes so black you could barely see the very faint light in the back of it.\n\nAnd if I ever had a wish in my life, it was for a glance at her or a moment with her would be enough for me yet I can\u2019t touch something so pure, I will taint and corrupt it, and how can I ask for that? Do the loser have the right to ask something of the winner? Do the loser get to keep his head up? No, only the winner does. And the winner has no words for the loser.\n\nIf I live I think I will live for her, the day she dies or stops glowing, I am sure will be the day flowers will bloom on my corpse and on hers.",

As soon as I want to share my experience and give some ideas to someone in here, I start worrying and considering 'what kind of access to mental health care does this person have? How isolated are they? How helpless has the depression made them so I can know, offer an idea that is doable?' . . .  and on and on.  You reminded me of something that happened to me.\n\nI spent my fourth grade school year befriending a neighborhood stray cat that I privately named Sam.  At first I thought he was a kitten, but after a few months I realized he was a full grown cat-a white runt with a permanent auto grease stain on the top of his head.  \n\nSummer came along, my mom got married (a wonderful man named Sam!:3) and our family moved to a brand new suburban neighborhood just far enough away to be in a new school district.  So the summer before fifth grade  I had three months to worry about Sam the white cat.  I pictured him in my head on and off throughout every day.  I imagined him from his mind's eye.  He was walking the sidewalk, winding through weeds, dodging traffic.  I worried about him the way only a little kid can obsess about something important to them.  Mostly, I worried about him getting hit by a car. This kind of daily worrying went on for some time, but I can't reliably recall how many weeks, or if it was months.\n\nNight time was the worst.  I am a night person and I do my best obsessive worrying late into the night.  Most of that summertime I worried about Sam. \n\n I was having my nightly 'think' about Sam one night while my eyes were aimed at the ceiling in the dark.   Then I heard a meow from the ground outside my bedroom window, then something hit my window screen and made me sit up fast.  It was Sam the cat crawling and meowing up the window screen.  Of course you know how happy I was to see him.  I silently hurried down the bedroom hall to the dining room sliding glass door to let Sam in at my feet.  I brought him to my bedroom where he roamed around, made noise being nosey,  licked my arms, purred and meowed, while I tried to sleep. \n\nBy early morning he was restless and I was very tired so I let him outside.  I never saw him again but for some reason, I also stopped worrying about him.  \n\nI also never told anyone what happened, that this cat I befriended found me somehow because I was worried about him.  He let me know he was OK, and I was able to stop worrying about him.\n\nWe're cheering you on, along with your lovely dear cat. Head bumps are loving fist bumps in catspeak. XO",

At the same time, there's other things like music, anything that you can throw on without needing to fixate on it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also agree that you should find a therapist, or someone to talk to about your problems.

But it always goes away in the end. I'm sorry you felt so bad, and I'm so glad that your cat was there to cheer you up. I wish you the best, and hope that you feel happy every chance you get.",

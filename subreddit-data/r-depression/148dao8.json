    "postText": "For context, I'm 22 and currently grieving a 6-year relationship and having a quarter-life crisis for finding a career. I do have *some* ideas and motivation to know what career I truly want to pursue. Yet I still have this self-doubt because of my memory issues due to my addiction to cannabis. I want a career that I would thrive and not feel depressed or stressed and unhappy,\n\nMy anxious thoughts sometimes are so intrusive and I have copped with my feelings by smoking cannabis frequently. It's what I'm dependent on as a coping mechanism since I was 17. Yet it's hindered a lot of progress in my life. Sure it has let me ignore the uncomfortable traumas or thoughts and just zone out. Though it's had havoc on my short-term memory and emotional well-being when I'm withdrawing.\n\nThere are moments when a feeling or memory creeps in and I don't want to exist in that moment, yet I know it's more like I don't want that traumatic feeling to exist, I want to live, I just don't want to live in this feeling. So I smoke and I drown myself out. I have not done much with my life because of this reason and that makes me more depressed, so it becomes a cycle where I smoke more to cope with feeling depressed.\n\nI do recognize I want to build a career and the only thing stopping me is my own self-doubt from having memory issues. I have been smoking since I was 17, so my memory is quite awful. I understand that growing up I had different traumas of being in foster care, being poor or just in really uncomfortable situations that have affected me.\n\nMy current breakup is sort of a cherry on top I guess. Though I think I'm handling it a lot better than my first breakup from when I was 16. I think back then it felt like the end of the world. This time it still sucks, though it's a different perspective because it's amicable since they were just as stuck as I am since he also is a cannabis smoker and we weren't growing together. Though he is in a much different stage in his life where were both looking for very different things.\n\nI rarely have gone outside that much since 2020 during quarantine. I have been smoking my brains out with weed and honestly being a complete depressed mess. Basically feeling like this unproductive degenerate and falling into a cycle of guilt for wasting my younger years.\n\nI want to start school someday, it's just I know I can't do it until I work on a number of issues. My agoraphobia and my discipline for not giving in to short-term rewards like smoking or developing the discipline to follow through on my own promises to myself instead of having this distrust that I can't do this. (like cleaning my room or working on a hobby or project or studying something at home).\n\nI would have this cognitive dissonance where I know and want what's good for me, yet I will procrastinate on it, which I know now comes down to my discipline. Yet it's also not as simple as just doing it, it's so much more nuanced than that.\n\nI think my memory problems become a consistent reminder to doubt myself when I can't even remember what I was trying to say or not remembering small digits. I also need to **stop** saying *I should have* done this or that because it's making me feel worse.\n\nI haven't smoked for 4 days. Though my biggest fear is relapsing when something stressful happens and I'm stuck in this cycle of copping again like this. I've heard of people relapsing from loved ones suddenly passing away. My only family is my mom and she is getting to the age where she will be gone one day.\n\nMy fear is making progress and then regressing one day when something tragic happens like my mom passing away from old age. Sometimes I find it incredibly wild that I am the last line in my family and that will be it. Any family or support system will have to be unrelated to me and that scares me as well.",

    "postText": "On May 4th my husband passed away and it seems like everything is going wrong since then. A cupboard shelf broke that he'd have fixed in 10 minutes. I couldn't find the parts that I know he had somewhere. Then my dog keeps getting out, he's very territorial and a little aggressive. No matter how many times I fix the area he gets out again. He he gets picked up by AC I don't have the money to get him back.  I don't want him biting anyone, I don't have the insurance to pay for that (they dropped me because I'm in a high fire area) Then the TV in my bedroom won't turn on, he would have fixed that too. Any my watch battery died. Now our well may be drying up which could cost me thousands of dollars that I will never have. When he passed away I lost 2/3 of my income. I just wish I went with him instead of having to struggle so hard just to keep a roof over my head.",

    "postText": "I think so at least. I feel literally nothing any longer. No sadness, no joy, no emotions of any kind. That's usual, but i seem to have lost all motivation to even try and find solutions anymore. I used to at least get angry or frustrated but i've stopped feeling that too now. I haven't gone outside in several days. Just have hit a breaking point, I believe. Not someone who deals with depression. Rather life has just kicked me so hard in the gut and i think i'm finally saying, alright, you win.",

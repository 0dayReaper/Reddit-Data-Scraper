    "postText": "I\u2019m a newly 19 year old of whom grew up with a happy family life. Mum and dad were loving and everything was sickeningly sweet up until puberty when they got a divorce. Since I\u2019ve had to cope with my dad becoming more and more distant, eventually bringing a woman into mine and my young brothers life of whom would single-handedly cause him to need intensive therapy at 15 from the abuse and manipulation she\u2019s exerted in front of him. I could sit and type every single bad thing that\u2019s happened in my life that plagues my mind daily but it feels pointless to do so and gets me in the loop of comparing my situation to other people worse off than me which deters me from speaking about it. I feel so down and alone with how I feel, constantly mourning what should have been a time where I was concerned about boy problems or what to wear to prom over trying my best to stop my dad from killing himself or trying so hard to hide how things effected me because my brother was worse off/nothing good would come of it. Sometimes I\u2019ll feel okay and push it to the back of my mind but other days the pain is so much and I\u2019m reminded of how I have nobody, regardless of the friends and connections I make from constant anxiety that opening up or being vulnerable will make me come across as needy or off-putting. I\u2019m too anxious of death and what\u2019s beyond this life to kill myself but I wake up every morning wishing I hadn\u2019t. The mere thought of having to feel this way any longer is so soul crushing. The fact I\u2019m resorting to Reddit purely to get this off my chest is enough on its own. But I don\u2019t know who to turn to or what to do. I\u2019ve been to crisis centres when I\u2019ve felt suffocatingly crushed but only got the general advice of \u2018powering through\u2019 which I\u2019ve tried everything in my being to do, I\u2019d give anything for this all to go away. \nI\u2019m just really not sure what to do.",

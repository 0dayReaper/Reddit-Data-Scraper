Like something electric going on in my brain.\n\nI take Lexapro for depression but now Rexulti has been added on to it.  I guess that means I'm messed up?  I'm starting to shake a lot and be restless.  Always worried.",

I honestly hate taking my meds everyday it's kind of a chore, but I know I have to do it. There are things around to help like good rx to give you discounts on meds, and if you have to, you could apply for medicaid or something like that. I have medicaid, and my meds cost thousands a month. (They are covered). I only pay like 3 bucks per medication.",

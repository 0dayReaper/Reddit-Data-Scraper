    "postText": "So I've battle with depression for a long time because of relationships, bad work environments, substantial stress from the type of work I've done, having been a mentor to people in their darkest places, and variety of other factors that either I accepted or fell into based on life choices. It's not asking for charity or any type of condolences. In all reality I had a very good childhood and have been blessed with quite a few things more than most.\nThe difficult part comes when you have your own depression but you've been exposed to so much of the world and humanity It becomes very hard to rectify being depressed knowing how bad some people have it elsewhere. You almost feel undeserving. And then to be told that you are struggle is even less significant than people who have never faced those atrocities, literal crimes against humanity, war crimes, human trafficking, and some of the deep secrets of the world. When people and various parts of society are so blind and privilege and accusing others of privilege that they don't even want to accept the raw truth that makes someone feel empty and depressed. \nThis is honestly just a typed out release. Because of the things I've been involved with most of the people in my life don't know and even fewer would genuinely understand enough to give reasonable responses.\nI have watched slave auctions in different parts of the world. Was involved in stopping human trafficking and I still have relationships in that realm. But there's an even darker side than all of that... When you know they're being exploited for sexual acts that would put modern horror movies to shame. Kidnapped people are seeing as product based on the value of the quality of their organs. Wealth that pays for such exclusivity even if it's legitimate a person can disappear.\nThis hit home because I had previously been assisting a person some years back to leave an abusive life and get sanctuary to see that there's good in the world. We lost touch because her handlers caught on. Recently we were able to connect again but in that time she has changed into desiring to keep the life. And the things she has to do make even someone with my past and temperament cringe. I want to cry desperately but I've been so exposed to this kind of thing the tears aren't coming. Want to protect her and show what a real life would be like but any suggestion of that instinctively pushes her to the conditioned response and programmed devotion to that life. There's subtleties that suggest she wants to escape but when that gets brought up she converts to her dedicated dialogue.\nFor those of you that are concerned she is able to live with mild autonomy and is being fed enough to live, and while what she does is heart-wrenching... There is... At least in her circumstance.... Nothing that can legally be done. Because if she openly states that it is her choice and what she genuinely wants the court will let her continue with practice because it technically is not bodily harm and is not, at least for the most part in our country, technically illegal. Where she is mentally would require years of reconditioning into what we would call a normal lifestyle.\nAnd like I said I want to cry but I just keep feeling hollow. Not a gut punch but a gut punch to the soul. \nIt's shared here because someone will have to make effort to get to me and the likelihood of people I know learning about my connection to fighting these things is minimal.\nSo please don't make this trend blow up but please understand that there are people who suffer darker face than others. Allow yourself to appreciate the small good things in your life.",

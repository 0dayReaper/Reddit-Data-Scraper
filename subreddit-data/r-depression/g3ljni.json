You have every right to be upset. Don't ever feel ashamed. It's really ignorant and super judgemental for people to say those things. Just because there's other people having it worse, doesn't make your situation any less \"better\" then them if that makes sense? What I'm saying is, your feelings and situation is completely valid to feel. I totally understand. You need more supportive people in your life, and won't be negative to you like the ones who told you those things. I would disconnect from those people, since they sound really toxic.",

They arent wrong though, you can take some lessons from this in future friendships. The best friendships arent ones where you count favors or owe each other anything but are the ones where you are each others friends and there for each other because you WANT to be! \n\nI maybe have only two true friends and in both cases they never ask me for anything ever and it can be so confusing and fristrating becauae everything else in my life has always been so transactional with people, ya know? But with them it is never about who owes who what or who needs who. If we need a friend and somwone to be good for us we are there no questions or expectations. I think it is really about learning the difference between peoppe that are good TO you and people that are good FOR you and finding those people, your people!! I hope you find that in your life!\n\nAnyways back on topic lol, yeah it does suck being the one that reaches out and initiates conversations and it reallg sucks when you make an effort to check up on your friends but they dont do the same. \n\nWell moving to another friend's advice of if you are thinking of/wanting to talk to someone then just do it! Someone has to be the one that checks on people and starts conversations so it might as well be you! If you have a good time when you are talking then i wouldnt worry too much about who texts or calls who first.\n\nI will say that you dont /have/ to be that person though, you should only do it (esp when not reciprocated) if doing it is what makes you happy. And if it makes you happy, shrug, why not and who cares if they appreciate it or not lol. You do it for you if thats the person/friemd you are and happiest being lol.",

Growing up i was hella shy like barely talked lol except for a few people i knew well. I got along with everyone though and was kind of like on good terms with everyone but not super close with anyone and that could be a negative thing bc i dodnt have that tight knit friend group but on the other hand i had a hell of a lot less drama! Lol! \n\nIm sorry you feel unnoticed and not appreciated, your feelings are valid and that sucks to feel that way! It is never fun to make an effort with someone or talk but not be heard., ya know? At the same time it may be a blessing in disguise because you are aware that these people arent your people and you should trust your gut / intuitions on if they are good for you or not.  The right people will listen and understand you and will appreciate you for being yourself. It sucks but you just have to keep trying with new people until you find ones thst you click with and things are balanced/reciprocated with where you invest in and build each other up-- those people will be your real friends!",

If the people u are concerned about demonstrate that they care about you in others ways I don't think the fact that they don't check on you means they don't care- but if you're the only one checking and trying to chat and being there for them and they don't do none of this for u, they're not worth your time.

It drains you mentally, makes you feel like shit. It\u2019s even worse than if you had not reached out to begin with.",

I deleted my fb, pretty much losing contact with everyone i fuckin knew, i had the mindset of ,'well fuck em, if they dont want to initiate anything with me then i dont with them'. I thought everyone just thought they were too good for me or they have people theyd rather chat to. I realised properly at the start of this year (i finished 3rd year of uni last summer) i had just shot myself in the foot big time. I had nothing else to lose and was depressed af, and decided to reach out to one of my best mates from school. He'd had an awful thing happen in his life at uni that i didnt know about, and after talking to him for a bit i realised he was in exactly the same situation as me. He didnt think people were bothered about staying in touch so he never reached out. Doing this changed my mindset a lot. If i see someone i know or know of in public i will make sure im the one to approach them and engage in conversation. I will initiate conversations on social media with old friends and usually the people are very happy to hear from you. \n\nSorry for the long comment, the post just hit me in the feels because its understandable to feel how you do about it, as I did. But i guess you have to remember they are only human and they have feelings too which maybe similar or even worse than yours. Im pretty sure this old friend of mine would not have ever got in touch with me if I hadn't with him. But its not because he didnt care deep down, i guess he just thought, i didnt care enough to get in touch with him so he felt he shouldnt care either and never bothered.",

Because how can they support me if I don\u2019t reach out? And if they don\u2019t reciprocate, then I don\u2019t need those kind of people in my life. But he was right. The fear of rejection or being seen as too needy made me self-isolate. \n\nSo now if I wanna reach out to someone, I do. I\u2019ve messaged people on Instagram or FB just saying \u201chey! I\u2019m thinking of you and wishing you well!\u201d Or even randomly texted people that I haven\u2019t spoken to in a while because something reminds me of them. \n\nSo, yes the phone works both ways. But if you wanna call, then call! Don\u2019t worry about when the last time you spoke, or when\u2019s the last time they called you. Go for it!",

Now if you never call at all, you get the same A result. But if you reach out, there\u2019s a chance that B will happen. So you\u2019re giving yourself a chance. \n\nAnd as far as being a bother to someone, i think that having that expectation shows a lot of your our insecurities. I get it. I would worry about that too. \u201cShould I leave them alone? I don\u2019t wanna dump all my depressed bs on them. Then I\u2019ll just be a burden.\u201d \u201cAre they mad at me? They didn\u2019t text me back...\u201d \u201care they just my friend out of pity?\u201d None of those thoughts are true. People don\u2019t really stay friends out of pity. That would incredibly emotionally draining. \n\nBut something I\u2019ve had to accept is that there are a million different types of friendships. Some are extremely close, and some are more casual. But all of them have value and are legitimate.\n\nI guess what I want you to remember is that you have value. And someone else not seeing your value, doesn\u2019t lessen it. So if it turns out that they don\u2019t wanna be your friend, that\u2019s ok. You want people in your life that see and celebrate your value.",

I'm still struggling with it tbh cuz now I just feel alone and neglected. It doesn't help that I'm fairly anti social and don't really go out much or put myself in an environment to meet new people, I've always been on the really shy side, so when the people I care about don't even bother to check up on me I just feel like a part of myself has been stomped on and why should I even try anymore. Sorry I just kinda took the opportunity to vent a little here but I guess in a way I can say that your not alone in feeling the way you do, there's more of us out here going through something similar.

Like I\u2019m always checking up on my older cousin, because she\u2019s been having a tough time during the quarantine, and she also has own mental health problems that she deals with, and I help her a lot but I feel like it\u2019s not really returned or she doesn\u2019t care as much as I do. \n\nEven with the holidays, I\u2019m always the first one to wish those who I check up on. And this past Easter, I didn\u2019t wish the same cousin \u201chappy easter\u201d because I just wanted to see what would happen, and just as expected nothing happened (I ended up wishing her happy Easter late at night because I felt bad). \n\nI want to stop caring as much as I do because it\u2019s pretty clear people aren\u2019t always going to do the same, but I can\u2019t help it because I know how much it sucks not having someone there. \n\nI\u2019m in a pickle too.",

We have spoken once on the phone in the last four months which is nothing compared to how it was prior to the move. I used to chat with my father on a daily basis and I lived with him. All of that changed when he left and moved out of the country. I slipped into a depression that no one understood. I was mad and upset that my own father wouldn't try and call or message me, but when I expressed such moods to him he told me the \"The phone works both ways.\" He said I should put in the effort as well and try to communicate with him and that is not a one way road. At this point I have accepted his decision that he moved away and I need to grow up, but it was a long and hurtful process.",

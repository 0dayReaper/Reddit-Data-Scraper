I don't look forward to the future because i can't imagine my future, i can't imagine a life where i am happy and enjoy being alive. There is no life without mental illness, i'm just stuck for the rest of my life like this. I wish i could die but i'm too much of a coward to kill myself.",

Usually its over something stupid, like a new book from one of my favorite authors, or a meal I really enjoy or listening to good music. It doesn't last, sure, but them's the breaks.\n\nI'm sorry you can't imagine the future you want. Perhaps you don't have to? Perhaps all we have to try and do is do the right thing day by day, and we might be surprised by where that leads?",

But I hated it when ppl would say anything about it and I\u2019ve gone my whole life like that now. I don\u2019t celebrate it or anything and so I kind of feel the same as you.\n\nWith that said, happy birthday. Just in the sense that I hope you have a nice day today. Even if we don\u2019t like it or celebrate it, it\u2019s still probably nice if the day goes well so I hope that happens for you. Maybe you can do something you enjoy today (even if it\u2019s just in your room on the internet). Not so much as a birthday thing but just as a kind thing for yourself. Take care.",

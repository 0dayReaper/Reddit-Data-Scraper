    "postText": "Over it. I\u2019m not even sad.. I\u2019m just done and starting to feel empty again. Everything feels like it\u2019s slowly falling apart.. After months of talking, I lost someone I thought would remain close to me, even as just a friend who could relate in ways others couldn\u2019t.. I ended up being blocked by him.. a few days later my car(that I just got at the start of the year) gets hit in traffic, family drama has amplified, my work environment has become increasingly toxic, especially within the last couple weeks to the point where I will probably end up leaving because I\u2019ve had to file a complaint with the state. I love my job, my managers are destroying it though. My self image issues are at an all time high right now, I\u2019m questioning my worth. My mental health has just been awful, I can\u2019t stop picking at my nails and peeling the skin off around my cuticles due to stress and anxiety. I can\u2019t bring myself to do the things I need to do. Does it even matter though ? Turning 30 this year and I feel like I\u2019m lacking so much. What\u2019s the point? What\u2019s the point in this post even? Just needed a place to get it out, I guess. I have no one to talk to who can actually relate to me currently. Everything is so surface level or they just don\u2019t get it. \n\nIn short, everything\u2019s a mess and I\u2019m tired. \nI\u2019m over having to push through every day. I just want to lock myself in my room and rot.",

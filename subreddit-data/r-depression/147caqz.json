    "postText": "For 2 years I've been struggling with minor depression but since May i feel like its gotten way worse. My boyfriend has been ghosting me and I found out that my bsf has been telling her bf (who im friends with but not rlly close with) my secrets about my relationship and family that I've told her in confidence. I've been self harming for a year and a half but it was never anything further than scratches up until january.\n\nI have no desire to socialize with my friends or family anymore, nor do I care to maintain my relationships. I pretend that I care and fake it daily, but I'm just so tired of everything.\n\nThe reason I don't feel my situation and feelings are valid is because despite it all my grades haven't slipped and my outside appearance and how I present myself has not changed. I am a straight A student, and an honor roll student. I destroyed my mental health for my bsf, and then she posted about how nobody was there for her and I just couldn't take it anymore. When I was sleeping over at her house one night, I went to put away her phone which she had left unlocked. I didn't mean to snoop, but when I looked down I saw her telling her bf things about my bf which I had told her just an hour ago (which were incredibly private and I said \"you cant tell anyone\"). I haven't confronted her, because I love her too much to lose her and I'm not a confrontational person and would rather just let it blow over. \n\nI feel like I'm not \"depressed enough\" to be taken seriously because there are others who have it worse out there.\n\nMy mom recently found my sh and instead of doing anything about it she said \"I better not see another one of these\" and walked away. I am in therapy and I take 5mlg of Lexapro a day (for a little over a month now) but it isnt working and I'm too scared to ask for help.\n\nI know when summer rolls around I'll get worse, because I'll have nobody to bother me or force me to fake my appearance. I'm just tired, and I shouldn't be. I'm only 14, I just want to feel normal.",

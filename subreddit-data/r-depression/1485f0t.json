I truly feel like my deoression is an inconvenience to her and people that don't suffer from it. They really can't wrap their heads around the severity of this illness. She wouldn't ask me this if I had an accident and my legs were broken. I feel just as ''paralyzed'' right now, and I can't even deal with it.",

            "comment": "Life feels lonely sometimes when people act this way. I talk to a counselor every couple of weeks because I can't dump my problems onto my loved ones. I keep my dark feelings to myself and my counselor. Ive reached out to people before. Usually doesn't go good. Usually it alienates people from me which makes my depression worse. If you are lucky enough to have a friend that listens great. I don't. They are hard to find. Thats part why I talk here.\n\nI feel exactly the same as you. The world feels cold and indifferent to me. As I continue to feel that way what it does to me is that I stop trying to please others and be there for them. Its sad that I do this but what else should I do? They don't care. I have wasted hours, months, years of my life being sad over my loneliness and lack of support. It was fruitless to sit expecting people to care how I feel. So I have become a more selfish and self centered person. That's the honest truth. I'm worried I am going to become even more selfish to be honest. I don't want to be that way. But what else can I do? When I am nice, I get taken advantage of. It is rarely appreciated if at all. Almost never reciprocated.\n\nAll I can offer to you from my experience is to take care of yourself. Do what you want with your life and your time that you have. That's all I have ever found much satisfaction in. I still do serve and help but my limits are much lower now than they used to be. I come first, and the people I help come second. And if I am hurting or need a break or time for me, these other people will have to wait. I don't care if they are mad.",

I can feel me pulling away from them and everyone else in my life.\n\nI don't think it's possible for non depressed people to understand depression and it's possibly even unfair for us to expect it. We alone understand our demons, and we have to deal with them every day. My wife tells me to fight. She doesn't understand that I have already fought the battle and lost. That's why I'm here.\n\nI won't drag anybody else down with me. I will suffer in silence until I can't suffer anymore.\n\nMaybe you can relate, perhaps not. It's my only chance of helping.",

Right now is not the time for talking about that.\n\nThe second biggest reason falls off of the first. Depressed people aren\u2019t reading the person they\u2019re talking to. You might not be close enough to this person to confide in them.\n\nThe third reason is that depression isn\u2019t circumstantial. There\u2019s shit going in that only envirnment, therapy, medication ect, can heal and that takes months or years.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cI\u2019m depressed because I my car needs to be fixed and it\u2019d impacting my life\u201d, it\u2019s usually \u201cI\u2019m depressed and can\u2019t find work, and can\u2019t keep work, and can\u2019t afford a car, and can\u2019t afford to make friends, and can\u2019t socialize\u201d. What is someone supposed to say to that? At least with the first one they can say \u201cjust stick through it and it\u2019ll be alright\u201d. You can\u2019t say that to the latter.\n\nSo all these things together makes a person uncomfortable. There is no \u201cwell why don\u2019t you do x, y, and z?\u201d Because that\u2019s not how depression works.",

Youre not able to do some things you could before, even si ple daily tasks like showering become difficult.

There is a clear difference. \n\nWhat snapped me out of my years long depression (11 hours of sleep each night, pale as a ghost, no muscle mass at all, barely ate, gamed or social media all day, for reference) was realizing how arrogant I was being. I have all my limbs, no life long incurable disease and I'm not starved or in a war zone or in North Korea.\n\nMy parents and upbringing didn't give me the tools to manage situations and my emotions. That's not my fault. But it's my fault to keep the feedback loop of \"ohhh I'm so broken and so low energy and worth nothing\" running. \n\nSo I very slowly stopped the cycle. The voices of doubt will never leave me but they quiet down over time with understanding that they are a part of me. No fighting with them. Just hearing them and keep moving with gratitude. \n\nBut God damn, I would never say a person with two broken legs was equivalent to being depressed. By my perception, that is so deluded. We can disagree on that of course but I'm grateful for what I have and each day to breathe.",

The only example of arrogance here is you having the gall to equate depression with arrogance. A person is not arrogant for being depressed. It's not a simple matter of ego and perspective. It's a disease with physiological causes and symptoms, and it can cause unbearable suffering despite anything and everything the person does to try to fight it. Your experience is not universal, and you are being remarkably insensitive imho.",

    "postText": "So much trauma haunting me, never thought I belonged. Been like this for almost 5 years now. All I need is some sleep to never wake up from.\n\nI tend to lose hope and get disappointed with every human being. Sometimes I feel like there's no good in them or there's a problem with me judging.\n\nThis world is so dirty and ugly, gives me a headache just by looking around. It has become like a kingdom of deceit, interest, wealth, jokes, gray color, fake laughs, noise, debauchery, fake art, fake love and many many many more. How stupid do you have to be to chose to be living here and breathe all the negativity around you rather than going to an eternal sleep, closer to God, getting out of this state of imperfection, look at this world from above and choose to forgive the billions of mindless creatures.\n\nThe sun is rising yet again.\n\nI think I'm giving this new day a chance anyway, it smells good and fresh outside.\n\nDon't know how much this positivity of mine will last but I guess I wont be around for long.",

I've never been in a break of dying. What if I survive in such situation, i will think \"oh, god, it was so scary, life is so precious, I want to live 100 years\" and blah blah blah? If I die, well, thats good outcome too.\nWhat do u think, is it possible?",

I encourage you to not give up. I\u2019ve been on 5 different meds and the class I\u2019m taking now makes me feel better and normal, not in the void anymore.  I took a genetics test at my new treatment place and it helped to see what meds can work and what meds won\u2019t work. Don\u2019t give up! You are important. Good luck",

Two of them almost caused my death, but honestly, when you're fucked up like me, there is no such thing as a will to live, so even when i've faced death two times, i didn't regain any will to live, and i still have the idea of suicide in my head. But people each have their individual experiences and thoughts, so probably, someone must've gained the will to live after almost dying, but that doesn't work for me, and i don't know if it will work for you. But if you want to go ahead with the idea, just do it. \n\nBtw, im sorry if i misspelled something, i'm brazilian, my english is not the best.",

I\u2019m the same person physically and have all my memories. Yet mentally and emotionally I feel extraordinarily different. Far more depressed and unfeeling about life.\n\nSorry for ranting.",

It seriously only took talking to a few patients over a couple shifts. And it wasn\u2019t even a conscious thought of \u201cI\u2019m so thankful for my life because these people are dying!\u201d And it wasn\u2019t like it made me want to live. I was definitely still depressed. It just completely kicked my suicidal ideation for some reason, and I wasn\u2019t suicidal for a good while even after I stopped volunteering. I think subconsciously interacting with people who actually were dying but wanted to live flipped a switch in my brain. I still don\u2019t quite understand it. I often wonder if something like this has happened to anyone else.",

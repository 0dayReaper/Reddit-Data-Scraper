    "postText": "I think my friends know how i'm feeling, at least a little bit. Not so long ago they found out about my situation and they know that i was never self-confident. Yesterday one of them tried to, well, i don't really know what she tried but she complimented me. She said that I'm good looking. This was the first compliment i have gotten in years and the first time i have heard that in my life and it felt good, even if i thought and still think that it wasn't completely geniuine. I told her that she was wrong, i don't know if they heard it because i've got a quiet voice. I really believe that, because the compliment didn't sound genuine and if it were true i would have known something about and wouldn't be so lonely. \n\nI just want to be a different person, in a different place, in a better situation. Why do i have to live this life?",

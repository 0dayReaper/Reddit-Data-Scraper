It's to the point I get anxious about them, because I badly want to do something. But that isn't enough when I feel like I'm being held back by chains.\n\nLife is in the dumps for me right now. I have to do some things to get out of it. I know what to do. But I'm not doing anything. And all this time, I'm terribly alone and lonely, unmotivated and unwilling. I feel like there's no point, as it's been so long with me trying, only to get screwed over yet again - - as if my past struggles along the way to something better have just been, for nothing.\n\nI'm not lazy. I'm just so goddamn tired to act out what I want and need to.",

                            "comment": "Depression can definitely take different forms for different people. For some people, the symptoms surrounding lethargy, lack of energy and motivation, anhedonia, hopelessness etc are the strongest. For others, anxious symptoms are the biggest problem, often with social rejection (perceived or real) and isolation being in focus. For yet other depression sufferers, it's a deep sense of guilt or grief or other mental torment that, for a subgroup still, can only be dulled by plunging oneself into a project, such as work, in an attempt to drown out the intrusive thoughts.\n\n(Obviously this is a simplification. I am a layman, there are more types of depression and they can intersect as well)\n\nAnother thing I've come to realize is that it can be incredibly hard to understand depression from the outside. As a lifetime sufferer, it is still hard for me to fully grasp and put myself into the frame of mind of someone who has depression that is very different from mine. On a day with weaker symptoms, I can't even fully understand what has been going on in my head for decades anymore. So it's really hard to expect healthy people, or people who are afflicted in a different way, to understand.\n\nBut that is not an excuse. According to the WHO ([data as presented on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden)), neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression, account for the second most years of life lost when adjusted for disability in Europe, with cardiovascular coming first. In North~~ern~~ America, neuropsych is first by a huge margin. In neither region does cancer come close.\n\nI'm sure your mother(?) wouldn't tell a cancer patient to stop being lazy and snap out of it. She shouldn't do it to a depressed person either.\n\n(I wouldn't be painting the full picture, however, if I didn't make it clear that cancer and in fact all other groups of diseases except for infant mortality are more lethal than neuropsychiatric disorders in these regions, so if you stop adjusting for disability and go for years of life lost only, it's a whole other story)\n\nThis data also kind of goes to show how, informally speaking, people don't care until it's too late, and how big a job the education systems really still have ahead of them.\n\nThere's cancer charities for everything (and that's a good thing, but even there some cancers are irrationally more popular than others. Not that many rectal cancer charities around, compared to breast or brain), and what do mental disorders (overwhelmingly) get? A social stigma.\n\nYes cancer is terrible and ugly and it kills. But mental illness affects more people and it gets you to hell faster (only that it's on earth).",

            "comment": "First, let me plz tell you that there's nothing wrong with being lazy. Everyone just has their own work pace which can mostly be affected by situations/weather and others. And remember we don't grow when things are easy, But we grow when we face challenges. Take as much self-time as you can and then come back like a warrior. Also, get rid of the toxicity around you because your mental health is much important than their comments affecting it.\n\nGive this article a read maybe it will help you.[https://ezcareclinic.com/5-common-psychiatric-problems-affecting-men-and-women/](https://ezcareclinic.com/5-common-psychiatric-problems-affecting-men-and-women/)\n\nMuch love.",

Just like sadness, happiness works on a dominoes effect if you can just take that first step. I know it's hard and even I still struggle some days or just say fuck it. But that feeling of accomplishment after making even a tiny change is enough of a boost. \n\nThe other day I bought a lot of beautiful clothes and that's motivated me to want to look good. Kind of like a sunk cost fallacy but in a good way. Try reversing negative emotions like sadness, anger and frustration into good ones and it will build upon itself. For so long I had the wrong idea. I told myself I can't be presentable unless I'm absolutely perfect but I'm learning to accept my flaws and appreciate who I am as a person. I've done some bad things and had karma fuck me up the ass.. now it's time for change. I don't want to die like this and if I accept defeat while I'm in my 20s it will only get worse as time goes by. You can do this, absolutely. Give yourself the chance others may not have.. nobody is superior to you by default.",

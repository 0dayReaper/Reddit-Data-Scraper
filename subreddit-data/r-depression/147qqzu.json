    "postText": "I don't even know who my doctor is. I've never had to schedule an appointment. I know where she works, I know she's a woman, and I know that she's coworkers with my mom, friends, even.\n\nMy mom has known me to be sad and angry since the age of ten. She has known about my difficulties with SH since I was twelve- although she thinks that I'm long clean and over that \"phase\" ever since she confronted me and threatened to go through my phone. She knows about my debilitating fear of loss of control (including an extreme fear of automatic toilets, vomit, asking for things, and being asked to do things). She knows about my eating issues to some degree, although she also thinks that's in the past. \n\nI cried to her this weekend about my fear of vomiting. I told her that there's something wrong with me. She doesn't get it. She keeps saying that everyone has their quirks and that there's nothing *to* fix. She said that pills and therapy aren't going to do anything. She *knows* about my OCD tendancies when it comes to my emetophobia, she knows that I have to map out every single manual toilet in the building, that I have to know where every trash can is, and that I have to have an escape route out of every room. Sometimes I don't even attend events because I can't deal with everything my brain makes me do. I can't have fun and it's making me miserable, and now she's saying that this isn't something that needs to be fixed. I am broken. And she makes me think that I'm going to have to live like this forever, and if that is true, then I'm going to kill myself.\n\nHow do I approach this? She doesn't get it. I have tried. I am nineteen, but I don't know how to ask for help from a doctor *because I don't even know who my doctor is*. They're coworkers. They must talk to each other. Walk in clinics are also being disbanded because everyone's making the shift over to family practice. I can't go to my own doctor out of fear that my mother will ridicule me and say that I'm overreacting. I'm not overreacting. I have a genuine phobia and I'm *trying* to get help for it along with my other issues, and she's making it worse. \n\nMaybe if I actually attempt. Maybe then she'll see. Or maybe she'll think I'm overreacting again.",

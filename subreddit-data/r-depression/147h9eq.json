    "postText": "I don\u2019t want consciousness and thoughts, I want to relax, I want to die instantly without doing it myself or I\u2019ll feel guilty, it feels that I\u2019m going to be a burden to everybody if I off myself, I want everyone to forget me, i feel really humiliated to be cared for and I feel like a cringey attention seeker when I have a mental breakdown. \n\nI kept imagining I\u2019ll accidentally fall from a high building or get hit brutally by a vehicle and just shatter to pieces. I can\u2019t sleep even though I want to, I fall asleep when I don\u2019t want to, nothing goes my way, and I hate myself. \n\nI tried hanging myself one time but the rope snapped off half way, and I cried at how pathetic I was, I told my parents and they said I was being immature and an attention seeker, maybe they\u2019re right, I\u2019m more childish than kids my age and it\u2019s embarrassing, I like to draw and play with clays and arts rather than studying. To make things even worse I\u2019m going to college soon, and I have no skill no smarts and my only hobby to draw isn\u2019t even good. Investing in art college is like burning money, because it\u2019s unstable future.\n\nMy siblings in my family are all smart geniuses and even more artistic than me, I feel like an outsider, I can\u2019t even eat food around them or I\u2019ll have digestive issues, I\u2019m a waste of space and my parents money. \n\nWhy was I even born at all?",

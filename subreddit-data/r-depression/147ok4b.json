    "postText": "hi. I'm 22F. my younger sister is 20F. 2 years ago, my sister confessed to me that she had been self harming during a turbulent time in our home. I think she developed a form of depression from it. after our family issues were somewhat settled, I think my sister stopped or at least lessened it. \n\ntoday I noticed cut marks on her arm again. I feel so helpless because I don't know who I can talk to about this. I tried getting her to see a professional the first time around, even offering to pay for it myself using what I had saved up from part time jobs. but she was very unwilling. my father is also pretty dismissive of mental health concerns and would likely not be ok with paying for therapy. \n\ni know it's awful to make this about me but I feel like I have a personal responsibility to my younger sister. I'm fairly certain I'm the only person who knows and has noticed that she self harms. i don't know what to do. please, I would appreciate any words of advice you may have.",

            "comment": "For starters you cannot help someone who will not try to help themselves. Keep reminded of that. But talk with her, or at least make sure she knows she can come talk with you. Be sure to remind her you are a safe place. If she feels you may involve parents or doctors she may keep to herself more. Let her know you are there to listen, to give her advice if she needs and that you are not going to judge her for anything. You could also encourage her to talk with friends or ask a friend of hers to check in on her. Maybe try spending time with her. Doesn\u2019t have to be a mission to get her to talk but to just show her you are there for her. To show her life isn\u2019t always hard and you have to find ways to creat your own happiness. Try a movie, ice cream date, walks together, get things for a craft. I hope she starts feeling better with whatever she\u2019s going thru. And I hope you can find a way to help her. Good luck to you both \ud83d\udc97",

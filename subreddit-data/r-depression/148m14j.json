    "postText": "I have been dealing with serious mental health issues for months now. One of the major reasons is because I didn't want to study what I was and I felt really guilty for letting my parents down. I tried telling them but didn't have the guts. But I tried opening up to mom and dad today. Yeah I actually did(a\u00a0bit) but apparently they don't care. I told them that I didn't want to do Engineering anymore and want to pursue Animation. At first dad ignored it(like he always does) and pretended like he didn't listen anything but when I asked him to say something he said that he has already paid the fees and that I could do animation or whatever but I still had to do engineering. He said he wanted to see  \"Engineer\" in front of my name and didn't care about anything else as long as I do that.\u00a0I said I won't do it anymore but he didn't listen and asked me who had brainwashed me all of a sudden. Then I broke down. I couldn't hold it in anymore. I started crying and told them how difficult the last few months were for me. I didn't tell a lot I just told them that I tried but couldn't do anything and felt really guilty about it. I thought they would be concerned seeing me cry but their reactions left me speechless. Dad closed his eyes and didn't say anything anymore and said he was tired. Mom asked why I didn't tell this before. I said I tried to but I couldn't. Then they started about the fees and how they had just paid the fees and how if I had told them before they wouldn't have. I literally broke down in front of them and this is what they care about ? I feel like such an idiot for trying to open up in front of them. They're acting like nothing happened and everything is all right. They're not even trying to talk to me about it or anything. And now I feel even more guilty and shitty. I feel like I shouldn't have said all that. What should I do?",

I earn decent money but the girl I loved my whole life I never had any courage to ask her due to my family pressures (as I knew they would have been so disappointed in me)\n\nI think I have achieved what I wanted to become as a person but I couldn't find any girl. I'm not a good looking guy so it's really hard for me.\n\n I always think whenever i feel low if I had just proposed to her in my school/college days. My life would have been totally different.\n\nFYI I proposed to her recently but i think it was too late. She didn't even respond to my text \ud83d\ude14\n\n\nSo the moral of my story, don't feel guilty about expressing your feelings. If you don't express them now you will regret your whole life.\n\nI hope you will feel better soon..\n\nOne thing i realised when I listened to some good songs. Those helped me forget all the bad stuff happening in my mind. You could try to divert your mind using music or find another hobby which will keep you occupied. So you don't get any wrong thoughts.",

    "postText": "It's even hard for me to talk to my family. I have a pretty large extended family, and I feel like no one understands me and hears me. Like I don't exist. I wish I didn't feel this way, because everyone treats me pretty well. I do have a few judgmental aunts here and there, but who doesn't? Regardless, I just feel like I'm dancing with swords sticking around me, having to perfect every move I make, or I'll get hurt and won't recover.",

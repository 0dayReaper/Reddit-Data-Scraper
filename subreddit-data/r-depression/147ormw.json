    "postText": "I feel so tired!\nYesterday I felt an unusual amount of energy and I thought \"oh hey maybe the meds kick in and from now on you get at least back to a fully functional level!\" But whom was I kidding?? As if it works like this. I mean I know, it doesn't work like this.\nHow do you aknowledge that getting out of bed and shower and do some necessary things is already good?\nHow do you tell yourself, that it's okay to use your main amount of energy to simply survive?\nI mean, I can repeat it in my head, but I don't believe myself.\nI am like all these stupid people telling myself to get my shit together and pull myself up, even though I know I really can't.\nEverytime I fall asleep I think \"and please don't wake up again!\" .. meditation and mindfullness I do practice but I can't be kind with myself. I want to hit myself because I am so angry that I just can't get out.\nI know it's a circle and I am waiting for therapy but. Please tell me how do you tell yourself that its okay to not be able to function normally??? and how do you accept that as truth???\nThanks for your suggestions.",

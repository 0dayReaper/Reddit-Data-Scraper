    "postText": "Hello there, first of all.\n\nI don't really know how to express any of this, nor am I doing this to read any comments really, I guess I just want to get this off my chest. Desperate attempt.\n\nI will just go straight to the point, I grew up in a very unstable household, I would always get hard-punished for the even the smallest of inconveniences by my mother, and I never really got to a point where I could feel like my dad was there for me as he, a truck driver wasn't present most of the time due to work. I kinda just grew up by myself for over 15 years and haven't really experienced any love at all. Neither loving someone dear to my heart or being loved, I just kind of got along and that was about it.\n\nIt has been a rough start but I never told anyone, since I grew in the \"crying or complaining isn't manly\" kind of life. Which you can figure out how much that has weighted over my years, I resorted to an online app where I dabbled in messed up shit for a long 4 years or so, I have seen many, many things that I shouldn't even know of at my age, my mind is either a constant silence or a tortured merry-go-round of bad memories, I never feel like anything is going on inside me, laugh is merely a temporary act before I go back to the cold-face I'm so used to wearing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have but one trusted friend that I met a year ago because as the selfish asshole I had been up to that point, ran behind her girlfriend and also ex of mine. They broke up because of me and a lot of other reasons and I began speaking to them in a silent night of drinking, a habit I so much hate on me but the minutes where all my problems just seem to fade feel acceptable.\n\nThis person is.. very much everything to me, she has helped with everything she could, even if it was temporary she still tries, and I learned to do the same. I am just now, at almost 16 years of age learning to love, which for some reason doesn't sit right with me, 16 years alive and just now I know what it is like to be loved? It disgusts me how I let it be this bad.\n\nI also recently lost a big part of my discord friends, one remains who I rarely play with so there isn't much for me to do in my day to day other than sit through school and come back home only to be bombarded by problems and chores constantly.\n\nThe gap of happiness that expanded for miles as a child has now narrowed down to a couple of centimeters and light barely shines through, It feels like I have forgotten what the sun looks like, I walk in black and white, surrounded by what only seems like bad things, I go out and I see a homeless man breaking down on a bench, no one bats an eye and neither do I help. Why, after so many attempts, am I still selfish?\n\nI am just not good enough and I know it. I try and try but I meet failure once again. Like the screen of a very hard level in a videogame I just can't escape it. I want it to end, to stop, it doesn't hurt anymore, it's just empty, a void that fills everything with darkness.\n\nI am sitting in my room, 3:19 am, writing in reddit the story of my life. How much more pathetic does it get? I have so much to ask and no one to answer. That one person is also slowly fading away as she starts having a relationship, I want her to be happy but it feels unfair that after how much I was there I. Run. Last.\n\nNow, a bit of a recap, I grew up with basically no father present, an abusive mother that bothers only to constantly remind me how much of a walking problem I am, barely having any company and the little I have is slowly fading away with someone else and a drinking problem while being underaged because yes, that is how much the place I grow in cares about me.\n\nI feel like I have nowhere to go, ending it isn't a possibility, I am scared of dying, but therapy... I just don't get it, it never helped, I never got any better from it neither did I learn anything.\n\nI live in the monotony of the teather that is my life, a scripted torture of the bufoon for the royal laugh.\n\nI need a tray with a solution, but the door has jammed. What am I supposed to do? Endure more of this? Close myself in my room till I dehydrate? It just isn't right, if there is a god somewhere in the universe, we scared it away.",

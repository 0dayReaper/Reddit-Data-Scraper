It brings me to tears thinking about how thankful I am to be here today because of my family, friends, and the wonderful people on this subreddit who helped me when I was down. I feel so immensely proud and happy right now because of my achievements. To all the people struggling through high school and college, there is light at the end of the tunnel. I LOVE YOU ALL!!!!\n\n\nEdit: wow thanks for all the awards, love, and support!",

Are you doing all the heavy-lifting by yourself? If you haven't already, it might be a good time to reach out to a few trusted people to give you a hand with a few things for a while. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure. \n\nTo remedy your situation there's those obvious things that everyone says like diet and exercise. But when you're depressed, where the hell as we supposed to find the motivation to improve those things when barely keeping everything else together! \n\nIf it's financially and time-wise viable, I think a mini, temporary cheat-code would be to book yourself for a few days at an all inclusive 4/5* hotel. A few days of 0 responsibility, two buffets of delicious food per day and a couple of relaxing activities might do wonders in terms of just letting go for a bit and recharching.",

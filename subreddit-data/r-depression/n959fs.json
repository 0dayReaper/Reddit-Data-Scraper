Speak to yourself as if you were a young child. Say it out loud.\n\nCheck them off as you go\nIf you do anything not on the list put it on and check it off.\n\nI'm not much of a writer, but over the last few months I've gotten on the computer or my phone and just written out a statement or letter to myself or anyone else that I needed to have a difficult conversation with. It put my thoughts in order and helped me effectively express myself, even if I didn't end up using the letter in my conversation. Little life changers.\n\nWhen I'm at ground zero I take little baby steps.\n\nCheck them off as you go.\n\nRepeat.\n\nJust some ideas that help me through painful times.

By sleeping constantly I can experience those good feelings. But just like death it means I don\u2019t have to deal with the crushing reality of life. I often wake from dreams in despair because the happiness I felt seemed so real and it takes me a while to come to terms with the fact that my dream wasn\u2019t truly my life.\n\nSure hope this makes sense because I\u2019m quite the inebriated fellow rn.",

I told a friend about this along with my depression and how aside from video games, most of my self care is out the window. She recommended that, since sleep is what I'm really enjoying so much, so that I build all of my self care around it. So now I have a fancy pillow, and one to go between my knees, I make sure I brush my teeth before lying down, I bought done nice skin care products and do a facial regimen, and when I lay down I play a mediation track on an app and 'meditate' myself to sleep. You would think making sleep more enjoyable would make my desire to do it worse, but since I started my pre sleep routine, I wake up much happier and easier. Might be something to try.",

Look, I understand what you are feeling, however, you need to be more humble, thankful of your own breath. This is not easy to do. Remember we are all connected and you are given an opportunity on earth to grow on your own. Perhaps you are not who you wanted to be, but no one is. Start with figuring out your likes/dislikes and expand on that. Help others. Work on being comfortable alone. Being alone is ok\u2026feeling lonely is a choice. Choose to feel humble, thankful, and exited for a new day.",

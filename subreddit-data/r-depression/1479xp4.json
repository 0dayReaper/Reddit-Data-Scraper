    "postText": "For the past several years the more positive work I've done, obstacles overcome with action, taking responsibility doing everything myself, the LESS happy I've become. The LESS happy and satisified I've been. It's so depressing. At this point I only want to be happy and self-sufficient without needing anything or anyone else at all. I've never been desperate or needy for anything, especially relationships. Nothing in my life is toxic and I have 0 toxic people in my life. It's much less anger and way more depression, hopelessness from life not making me happy despite having it together.   \n\n\nI can't take getting misery for hard work and being constructive anymore. Extremely frustrated and at a loss after applying all the 'positive' advice in the world. But more importantly people piss me off giving useless advice that hasn't worked or made me happy at all. Can't stand that futile, mocking series of thoughts anymore like everything I do is a joke.",

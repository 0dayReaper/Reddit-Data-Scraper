    "postText": "I had a moment of my life where I didn't feel like this... It's like tasting a forbidden fruit that nobody will tell You how to get...  \n   \nSome context ig... I am trans I denied it and hid it through most of my life leading to me repressing my feelings and living in a painful but somehow bearable state... I got kicked out of the house and almost killed by my father I somehow managed to scramble and move to another state and finally accepting myself, I managed to get better... I remember feeling actually happy for the first time in years and overcoming guilt that I was taught to feel about it... I have gone through living in abandoned bunkers to some shitty places with cockroaches and finally to actual room I rent... \nI found friends... And there was a time I felt like I could live like that... And I guess I should now go to therapy or something... But I don't have the means and I feel scared... And all the shitty things from the past come back to me to haunt me... And suddenly I feel like it's all not worth it... And I am idealizing ways and reasons to just end it...\nAnd as much as I know my friends would get out of their lives to save me... It still feels like I'm just a burden... And I feel scared of all that...\nAnd I don't know what to do...\nI want to get better I guess... Or just be forgotten to not hurt anyone...\nI have no clue how to do either...",

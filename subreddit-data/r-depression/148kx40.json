During those minutes or hours that we spend shopping we fell safe, we feel okay. When i go to a grocery store i can forget about everyting bad in my life and just look at the price labels. Beeing able to pay money makes me feel better too, because i know i won't find myself on the street tomorrow. I don't know how to help you. I don't think anyone on this sub does.",

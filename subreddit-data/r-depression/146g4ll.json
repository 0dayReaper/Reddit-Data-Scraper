    "postText": "I\u2019ve never been in a real relationship before. I feel like I missed my chance. I always saw other kids at school together and seeing media like shows and movies with people finding love, but I never did. I\u2019m just alone. I try not to think about it and just focus on the other important things in my life, but every once in a while, the thought of that love pops back up and it sticks in my head for ages. It eats my brain until I eventually just\u2026forget to be sad. Then the cycle continues. It feels impossible to look for a girl that could like me because I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll fuck it up. Like, how would I find or approach someone? Tried dating apps. Pussied out. See a nice girl my age in person that could possibly be single? Don\u2019t talk to her, you\u2019ll fuck it up. How? I don\u2019t know. All I know is that you\u2019ll mess it up. I don\u2019t even know if finding someone would fix this feeling. What if I just \u201cthink\u201d I need to be in a relationship? Even if I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t wanna die alone! What the fuck do I do???! I can go on and on about it but eventually I\u2019ll just be a broken record. God it just hurts to think about. When I look at someone I think I love, the first thought isn\u2019t \u201cwow, I want to be with them forever. I love them.\u201d It\u2019s actually \u201cyou\u2019ll never have that. Don\u2019t even try.\u201d I just want an answer. Something that can make me not hurt like this. Something.",

I personally didn't find love until I was 25\n\nIf you work on your self-esteem, you may end up giving yourself a chance to get out there and meet your match. At the moment it seems as though your self loathing is holding you back",

It's not realistic in the least bit to expect everyone in their early 20s to have experienced a loving relationship. To me you just came out of highschool, and have only been an adult for a few years",

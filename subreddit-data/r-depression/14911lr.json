    "postText": "The decision was made tonight between me and my wife of two years and partner of five years that it was time to part ways. I am heartbroken, because I have spent so much of my life and have built a life with this girl for nothing it seems. Between that and not doing what I want to do with my life careerwise, I just don\u2019t know what to do with myself anymore. This is not a cry for help, nor is it a final plea, I\u2019m just lost and I\u2019m tired of everything. I am officially burnt out on life and and am done with everything.",

I think what's worked well for me was trying to develop my sense of self esteem and self worth. For example, I used to feel really down sometimes being alone for a few days, even if the week prior I had been surrounded by people and had a good time. Learning that being alone sometimes doesn't mean you're ACTUALLY lonely or alone. I started seeing it as an opportunity to work on some hobbies and that made being alone something to look forward to. I think this could work well for anyone, because let's say you don't have many people in your life, and you genuinely are feeling disconnected, finding a hobby is a great way to build up your confidence AND find people that you have something in the common with (the hobby at a minimum) and build up your social circle. And remember, it's pretty rare to find someone that you 100% connect with on every level, and that's ok. I remember in high school there was a lot of pressure to have this ultimate \"best friend\". Sometimes as an adult, you just gotta find a few different friends that fulfill different needs, if that makes sense.",

I\u2019d say to help avoid all this, in my opinion of course, is to do everything you want to do while you\u2019re young . If you\u2019re into music or martial arts or drawing , etc do it. You may like some things and hate others... hey, at least you did it and figured out what you like and don\u2019t like. That helps you find out who you are.

My thing was that I always knew something about me was \"different\" from the rest of my friends and family, and at one point in high school was actually 100% convinced that my parents were paying my \"friends\" to hang out with me (they weren't). I was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and that was why I would draw back from everyone every now and then, that's why I got more excited than everyone sometimes, and laughed louder. What I thought made me some psycho age-regressed teenage child, was actually mania coming into swing. This part might sound stupid, but getting that diagnosis just lifted a weight off of my conscious. I'm still 100% that person, but knowing *why* I'm that person has allowed me to love myself, *for me.* And it's been the most beautiful transition of my life. I'm not saying yours is caused by an undiagnosed issue, and I hope it's not, because this isn't easy, despite learning to love myself through it.\n\nMy advice to you: As easy as this is to say (though much harder to implement), love yourself. Look in the mirror every morning and say it out loud. \"I love you, me.\" Make lists of the great things in your life and what you love about yourself. And, find your passion. If you love your hair, work with it. Learn to do cool shit with it. Gardening? Do that. Just do *something* that makes you *feel you again*. You come to notice that when you fall in love with yourself, you come out of the background. You were just an extra in the movie, but then you get a promotion, and you get the lead role. And then, one day, you'll look back over the past few months of your life, and you won't be able to think of a scene in the movie that you weren't the star of. Just, whatever you do, don't give up. Because you *will* become the lead role. You just have to find *you* first.",

I was a mechanic and approached the whole thing in a very mechanical way until I found the perfect tuning for my body and mind\u2026 and you know how the story goes, you get those two right and the soul reveals itself.\n\nSimilarly to how you have gauges on your car for the various mechanical systems, I discovered there are levels for our body, mind and soul as well. This made it really easy to fine tune the tuning process.\n\nI know there are many masters out there who swear that you need to learn from a master to really get meditation right. It's not like we need to go within and re-engineer everything. That's highly impractical.\n\nBody, mind and soul; 3 gauges, only 5 levels each! It doesn't get any easier. With the right tuning, it's like clockwork\u2026 you can pretty much set it and forget it. That's how wonderful our humans really are!\n\nI just focused on the tuning method and simplified it so that it\u2019s easily repeatable and tested it out with difficult situations. 3 gauges, only 5 levels each! Body, mind and soul. It doesn\u2019t get any easier\u2026\n\nEventually, nothing phases me anymore; people, circumstances\u2026 I even had the opportunity to test it out in court and just sat there and tuned myself the entire time and everything just went my way. It felt like the judge and I were being connected! The ruling was better than I had wished for! I did get a little too excited during the end though!\n\nNow, everyday, I just take a few minutes to re-calibrate and get realigned, mostly after my meals. Not only did I overcome the depression and anxiety, everyday is like a dream. I\u2019m happy for no damn reason!\n\nAnd I can feel it in my heart. It\u2019s like a real sensation coming from my chest. The technical term is the heart chakra and it has something to do with energy. I don\u2019t care about all of that though. I just know that it feels really good and at any moment, I could burst into tears of joy for I am so blessed!",

I can count the number of real connections I've had with people on my fingers. Sadly, my late husband knew me better than I know myself, we were married almost 30 years, worked together and never had a real argument. I always thought I maintained my own identity but when he died I realized that I hadn't really because you can't do both. I thought at first that I would be alright eventually,  now I know I will never be,  there was nothing much before him and there's nothing now. I go day to day in parallel universe on outside looking in. I've had a couple of dates with perfectly nice guys but there was nothing there. Older men who've been single for long time don't show much interest in long term relationships and are sort of like fine if you do and fine if you don't. I am lucky to have had what I did, real love, partnership, mutual respect, partnership, friendship. With great love comes great loss and that is just too much to ever get over. When he died, I died too, didn't know at the time but do now. This is not living, it's existing",

I am really envious of my co-workers, of the people I know of for seeking to be so peaceful, of doing so all right with everything, of not having this vermin inside their head like I feel I have. \n\nI feel so different from them and so inferior because of that. \n\nI feel like even when things get better, they eventually go down again.

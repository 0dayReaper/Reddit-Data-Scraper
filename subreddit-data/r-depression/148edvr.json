    "postText": "Another cookie cutter rant post that no one reads because everyone is experiencing the same thing. I'll try writing my thoughts out because, literally, what do I have to lose, right? Who cares if they just get thrown into the ether? At least I was able to express them in some form. \n\nTruly, it's a struggle. I'm teetering between crying, laughing at just how trivial my problems are in the grand scheme of things, laughing at just how hopeless it all is, and just simply rotting away and letting myself sink even deeper. I'm aware that I could feel even worse than I already do, and that's truly scary and probably the only real motivation I have to do much of anything.\n\n\"I'm not built for this world or this society\", is what I like to tell myself, as if I can romanticize my failure as being some objective fault with anything but myself, but I suspect the truth is I'm just absolutely, simply not worth anything. No value whatsoever. I could accept either reality, but the torment comes from not definitively knowing. I long for something to give me a hard truth like that. I don't trust people who say I have value because they tell me what I want hear, not what I want to know. I don't trust people who tell me I have no value, either, because I can't trust their motives and they ultimately know as much about innate value as I do, which is to say nothing. \n\nEmpirically, I have no accomplishments to speak of. I was told as a child that I had so much potential, that I was so smart, that I would undoubtedly be successful... I'm 23 with no degree and not in any schooling. I have no partner. I can't even pay for mental or physical health treatment.\n\nI'm sick. I'm ugly. I've barely made ends meet these past 6 months after my car broke down and caused me to lose my job. If not for my mom generously paying my bills, I would be homeless right now. I'm trying to find a job I can handle to make some kind of a living, but not one place I've applied to has the decency to even tell me that I suck and that I'm not in consideration. Instead, I get complete radio silence, or \"I'll contact you soon\" with no follow up whatsoever, or \"application under review\" indefinitely. Can't they see I'm desperate and need this? Is that why they don't even give me the time of day? Meanwhile, the bills keep coming and I continue to grovel for assistance from parents who probably hate me.  \n\nI can't even clean my fucking apartment. \n\nI can't seem to make any progress before something decides to set me back further than I was before. I'm a failure.\n\nI would give anything to have the opportunity to apply myself. I desperately want to go to school and educate myself--accomplish anything even if it's just a footnote. I want to get help and fix my issues. This all requires so much money and work ethic that I don't even have a fraction of and likely never will, though. Even then, if I were given the opportunity of a lifetime, I would likely squander it, if I'm being honest. Should I be mad at the system, mad at myself, mad at creation or a creator, if there is one? Does it really matter if the outcome is the same?\n\nIs what I wrote even comprehensible? I'm really tired; thanks for not reading.",

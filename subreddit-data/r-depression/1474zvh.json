    "postText": "I've battled depression for most of my life. I have realized over the past few weeks that I am just so depressed. I don't care about anything. I just sit and zone out. I've tried numerous medications  and prozac has always worked best for me but I'm on 40 mg and it doesn't seem to be helping at all now. \n\nI have an appointment with my therapist this week but I really want to cancel it. I'm so tired of everyone's platitudes and advice that just doesn't help. \n\nI don't really know why I'm posting, I just need to vent I guess.",

    "postText": "I 24f recently got married. I have undiagnosed BPD,C-PTSD, depression and most likely autism too.\nMy husband had a job and a place to live so I ended up moving to where he lives, which is 6 hours away from my family. I said i didnt wamt to move to everyone, but they just said id get used to it and settle in.\n\nNeither of us drive, which means to get anywhere we usually have to take a train, which is about \u00a3300 to my parents. \n\nI miss my friends so badly. I don't have any friends here, and with so much trauma from trying to make friends and getting rejected I don't have the energy to even try making new ones, even if there were any to make! His town is full of old people. Who are lovely but they're not at all on my wave length. \n\nMy husband is an introvert and doesn't see 'friends' the same way I do. \nMy friends would go places with me, invite me out, organise party evenings, even of it was just the two of us\n\nHere I am just at home all the time. The only person I see is my husband or his mother in law, who although hasn't done anything wrong is getting more and more on my nerves everytime I see her.\n\nI've been depressed for years now, and honestly I just want to die. I'm so tired. I don't want to kill myself, but I think about it a lot. And hurting myself. Then I think I'm just attention seeking, and if I meant it I'd have tried already.\n\nI try to talk to my husband but it just makes him upset and depressed and then I feel worse so I just bottle it up\n\nI want to go home. I want to live near my family and friends and my dogs. But we can't afford to move. \n\nI just feel like a spare part here, an NPC even. There's no point to me. I keep asking for a puppy, something to look after, so I have some purpose but my husband just keeps saying one day, as we can't afford it.\n\nI'm so bored and lonely. Nothing feels worth doing. I just want to dissappear from existence. I want the pain inside my brain to die.",

Then you would get some nice experience from other people as well...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm diagnosed with ASD and ADHD, but it's C-PTSD, really...\n\nThere's a book called \"No broken parts\" I haven't gotten to it myself, but it kind of explains all the parts you develop during childhood trauma. Might be worth a read?\n\nAnd also check on your personality type, and see how your brain functions, especially loops and how to get out of them. It has helped me some, and it might help you in discovering a purpose...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou explain a need to feel included, adventure, and such. Which makes it sound like you're an introvert as well? In any case, these are your needs...\n\nYou probably feel a need to go all out, but it's better to start small. Variation is what is needed. \n\nAnd you should some other friends as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTalking to your husband makes him upset and depressed, so you bottle it up. Which is unhealthy. There is no wonder you feel the way you do...\n\nYou can try to talk to someone who you can trust. Or you can write a journal. Watch movies or listen to music so that you feel less alone in your experience.\n\nYou and your husband should also learn to communicate with each other without putting an expectancy on the other, and also not taking in the other's emotion as wholly your own. There's probably some information on that online.\n\nYou express that you want your husband along on your adventures, so you need to figure out a way to do that, in a scenario that's a win-win for you both with the limitations you have. You could even take turns, if you don't find a middle way.\n\nIf he's not playing along at all, you need to do it on your own. \n\nI guess there is a reason why you react to his mother as well? It may be irrational, because you feel stuck. Or it may be some behavior in her or him that you are suppressing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout getting a dog, you might create a win-win over that as well. If you get a dog, you'll do this. If you don't you won't. Of course that's childish and manipulative, but I think not respecting your needs is as well - so long they are reasonable.",

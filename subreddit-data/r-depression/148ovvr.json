    "postText": "I\u2019m not really sure why I\u2019m writing this. Last night I had a vivid dream that ended with me ending my life. And then later I got a call reminding me how worthless I am. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with adhd, severe anxiety, and depression. And for awhile I was taking medication and I was better, but eventually the medication just made me feel worse. I also got in a car accident last November and now i don\u2019t leave the house. I\u2019m scared to drive, I\u2019m scared to be in a car, I\u2019m honestly scared to leave the house. I shower maybe once a week if my anxiety beats the depression. I stopped going to my college classes. I don\u2019t have a job. I\u2019m worthless, I\u2019ve become a burden to everyone around me and I don\u2019t know how to do better. I know they would be sad if I was gone but I wouldn\u2019t be a burden to them anymore. Sometimes i get really suicidal and I feel like I should tell someone but I can\u2019t. Getting help cost money that I don\u2019t have and I can\u2019t be a burden anymore. I don\u2019t leave my bed anymore, i just wanna sleep forever. I never talk to anyone about this and I really just needed to say it somewhere.",

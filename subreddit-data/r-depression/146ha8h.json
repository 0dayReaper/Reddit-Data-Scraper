    "postText": "The only reason I would own a weapon is to just run around shooting and stabbing people that I don't like. At this point I don't give two shits. I would end the lives if many people, just to feel like I finally did something. Because I contribute nothing to this world, no matter how hard I try. And I'm just an ugly, antisocial, fat, psychotic, deranged idiot. And for my whole life I've been cynical and negative. I never could focus on any of the positives. Only because I feel like we are all born, we suffer, then we die. And nothing happens after we die, we just... Lay down and rot. People always say all these great things about me, like the fuck you saying? Whenever positive people talk to me, I'm like, shut the fuck up, I know what you are trying to do to me, and I will not stand for it. No, I have not accepted God or Jesus as my \"lord and savior\" or whatever the fuck. People only do that just to get a free pass to do whatever the fuck they want.   And I don't give a FUCKING SHIT if you think there are so many great things about me and I need to acknowledge the good things about me and what I've done that was good! Like the fuck you want me to do, play pretend?!?  Oh, yeah. I would kill people all day if I had a knife l. Don't care if I get thrown in jail, I would just have a satisfied smirk on my face and know I only did what needed to be done, and nothing else. I would also slam babies heads with big rocks, too. Something I've always wanted to do, y'know. Just take a FUCKING DEVILSPAWN INFANT AND SMASH ITS FUCKING FACE IN WITH A BOULDER!!!! THEY DESERVE IT, OKAY?!?!?!!!!!?!??!!??!???? BECAUSE ALL THEY DO IS CRY AND SHIT THEMSELVES!!!!! DONT YOU SEE A PROBLEM WITH IT?!?!?!?!?!!!!??! OH, IM THE ONE WITH A PROBLEM?!?!?!?!?!?!!??!?? FUCK YOU THEN!!!! I'm only going to do that because I want what's BEST for us all, and death to all infants and toddlers is a good fucking start. Part 2 out soon",

            "comment": "Sure... \n\nWould you feel like you have contributed to anything though?\n\nOur bodies die, but how we are when we die, I guess it might be transcended or something. So unless you want to experience life forever this way, I guess you should make some changes.\n\nI think you're so negative and cynical, and you can't focus on anything positive, because you haven't experienced many positive things... Right, so there's something you can do right there. It won't fall into your lap though.\n\nAnd I can see you have a lot of anger, but I don't think smashing babies' faces in would help you feel any better.\n\nI was on the brink of just going around smashing capitalist cars, because they deserve and I was angry and I have never gotten any help, and minimal love - and a lot of punishment and shame.\n\nGiving in to such an anger is like a drug, and you'll loose control. I don't think that's healthy. You'll feel powerful, but you'll never feel loved.\n\nTo feel loved, you need to be sensitive, honest and open, and you'll be rejected like 99% of the time. You might never experience it. \n\nWhat do I know? I kinda like to kmsrn. Last time was years ago, and people generally treat me as shit as a projection of their own shit, and when I try to point that out - in a careful and respectful manner - they get really defensive because their small and fragile ego's can't handle it. And since I'm an outcast, I must be the one who is wrong in any case, because they lack the intelligence to examine what I really communicate, because it's easier to just interpret things on a surface level, because again - society is shit and people are so paranoid and stressed out that they can never catch a break and truly observe.\n\nBut if you are going to act on violence, I would hope you would do it in a limited way, by restricting it to values and so that you are in control of it. But be careful though, don't be like the hypocrites who only interpret things on a surface level. Things might have an unforeseen consequence...\n\nNO, sorry - it WILL... \n\nSo when you smash the car of the biggest absolute douchbag in your neighborhood, he gets so angry that he beats his wonderful puppy wife, who is then so hurt that she can't take care of the kids in kindergarten, so that the special little boy who really needed her attention, didn't get that attention - and he becomes like you.\n\nHe might have gotten that attention, and would grow up to live a happy and wonderful life, because he could see all the hypocrisy, but he felt loved inside in any case and could distance himself from it - and he picked up some friends he knew needed help and were not hypocritical assholes, and move somewhere nice where people are not totally infested in their brains by some kind of psychotic psychopathic zombie virus. \n\nThere they would probably live more or less as real christians, and not some moralistic \"guess the scapegoat\" game.\n\nTake care! I would send you any love, if I had any.",

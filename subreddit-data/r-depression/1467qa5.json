    "postText": "Yesterday I had a really personal email convo with my manager and she was saying how she\u2019s always here for me and we both opened up about our struggles with depresssion. We were always appreciative of each other but this is the first time we really got \u201cpersonal\u201d on that level. She said we had a connection years ago when we met and that she felt it (she said this a few weeks ago) and yesterday she said it was meant to be (us knowing each other, ect) which I agree with and was so shocked and happy to hear she feels the same. I think I might see her when she comes to the office next month and I want to give her these two books I immediately thought of. One is called \u201cthis book was MEANT to find you\u201d and another \u201ca gentle reminder\u201d they\u2019re just positive little books. I was thinking of wrapping them both together either in brown wrapping paper or buy a small book cover/bag and but them both in there. Would this be ok to do? And give it to her before she leaves the office. I always wished I could give her something more than my thanks like flowers or something if I saw her more but I just had this idea. Opinions? Or would it be weird",

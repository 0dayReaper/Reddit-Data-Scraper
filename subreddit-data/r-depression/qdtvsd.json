I suck the energy out of every situation, I\u2019m no fun, I\u2019m never in the mood for laughing because I just constantly feel like crying. I\u2019m like a black hole that sucks all the fun away and everyone on the outside just sees someone who\u2019s constantly in a bad mood, there goes any chance of potential new friends approaching me. I wondered why people leave you during depression but I got it after that, I wouldn\u2019t want to be around me either.",

I could deal with no effort from their side, but when you constantly push people away, getting angry and irritated even if they try to be nice then who do you blame for leaving you to be yourself after a year? P.S. I haven't left yet, but as you can see, it hasn't been fun.",

I feel like im just one of those side characters that no one cares about and im starting to get worried that its messing with my mental health and just being healthy in general I\u2019ve stopped caring about everything i eat or drink . I dont even wanna type anything anymore because i know no one cares and no ones even gonna listen to what im saying or yk maybe someone is reading what im saying..:.::. Fuck it nobody cares",

That\u2019s what I did. It\u2019s hard to be there for someone who\u2019s dealing with depression because they\u2019re not doing what they need to for themselves to try to give themselves a fighting chance against the depression, because they\u2019re depressed. I think sometimes depressed people feel shame and guilt for being depressed and when people around them try to be nice, they take it as pity and it makes them feel more guilt and shame, and then they want to avoid the feelings that rise up when someone interacts with them who knows they\u2019re depressed.\n\nThere\u2019s such an impossibly fine line to ride between being there for someone who\u2019s depressed and not letting it affect you or the way you interact with them.\n\nI would try not to criticize, prod, or chastise your friend. If you\u2019re doing anything that guilts or shames them, that might be why they\u2019re pushing you away. It could also just be that interacting with you while you\u2019re being nice makes them confront feelings they don\u2019t want to. I felt really guilty and shameful when my friends or family would be nice to me while I\u2019m depressed because I felt pitied at least, and I felt like a failure because they felt the need to pity me. Maybe they weren\u2019t pitying me.\nI can tell you for sure though, I pushed everyone who just expected me to be normal and didn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t normal right out of my life. Those people don\u2019t help the situation and exacerbate negative thoughts and emotions. \n\nTry to do activities together and get them outside and active. It preoccupies their mind so they aren\u2019t ruminating and festering negativity, and makes it seem more possible that change is possible. \n\nIn the end though, they have to decide to take the steps necessary to give them a fighting chance. Antidepressants help because depressed people\u2019s brains just aren\u2019t equipped to plan for the day, to prepare meals they need, to be active and interact with people. \n\nI would understand if you flinch and need space from these people. It can feel like you\u2019re failing them or aren\u2019t enough. Kudos to you for being there. I lost almost all the people I loved and cared for due to depression.",

                            "comment": "I don't think I can fully agree with your opinion.  Sometimes you need to leave people because you have your own mental health to worry about.  I've suffered from major depression &amp; anxiety for more than half of my life (still do), but it has improved slightly.\n\nI met a guy (I'll call him \"Bob\") 5 years ago who also suffered from major depression and anxiety and we became the best of friends.  We had a lot in common.  However, his depression and anxiety became so bad that he could rarely ever leave his apartment.  I understood how debilitating depression can be, so I would often visit him and we'd spend time together.\n\nThis went on for many years and it got to the point where Bob would outright refuse to take one step out of his apartment, and he would make me feel guilty whenever I couldn't visit him whenever he wanted me to.  Often times, I couldn't visit him because I had my own life to live and I had a lot of my own depression and anxiety to deal with.  But it felt like in his eyes, only his problems and needs mattered.\n\nFor the last month that I was friends with him, a lot of terrible things happened in my life.  My grandfather got extremely sick, my father had a heart attack, my partner had to have emergency surgery, I even thought I was gonna be homeless at one point because I thought my estranged sister would seek to have me evicted from the family house (she threatened me but didn't go through with it).\n\nAt that time I told Bob I couldn't spend time with him because I had a lot of problems going on and that I was extremely stressed out and depressed.  He told me in response that I was bad person who \"didn't care about him or the friendship\" and that \"I wasn't making an effort\" to see him.  He also told me I should go and see a doctor (even though he refuses to see one).  He even lectured me about how I'm living my life all wrong and that he knows what best for me.\n\nI was extremely hurt and realized that the friendship was extremely draining and toxic.  I wasn't helping his depression/anxiety situation.  All I was doing was making him overly reliant on me to meet his emotional needs.  He didn't want to help himself.\n\nSo to say someone is selfish for leaving is a little manipulative.  I need to look out for my own mental health too.  My mental health is just as valid as Bob's was.  His depression doesn't outweigh mine.\n\nJust because you're depressed it doesn't give you the right to be an asshole to others.  Saying others have to be there for you regardless of how horrible you treat them really isn't fair.  Depression sucks but it isn't a get out of jail free card for when you mess up and hurt others.\n\nDo I still care about Bob? Sure.  But I can't ever have him in my life again.  It wasn't a healthy situation.  Unfortunately, the help he needs isn't something that I'm capable of providing.",

I\u2019m saying if she\u2019s not there to begin with. If after 6 months or a year, I\u2019m STILL giving off negativity, she has a right to set her own boundaries.

They also stole a ring that doesn\u2019t fit them for no reason. They have money and idk why they would steal a completely cosmetic item that they don\u2019t use.. That made me a bit anxious (also I was bored, so I can see how I was in the wrong) so I took another person from the group and we left the main group and went to an arcade. Main group was mad at us, I was anxious and kinda shut down a bit, stopped emoting. and was on my phone for the majority of the day. One of them saw me swiping through the Home Screen apps and called me out lmao.  \n\nAnd now I\u2019m realizing that this.. Isn\u2019t really related to the main post.  \nSorry",

Even when I know that being around other people is a step towards getting away from depression, if only for a little while. So I kind of end up in a loop. \n\nAnd because I've been thinking about this a lot I've started to notice it in situations when I am with people and that only pushes me towards more depression and isolation. \n\nRecently I realised though I never think about anything positive about me from an outside perspective. And although I could write you an essay long list of reasons why I could imagine hanging around me would be shit - it's highly unlikely that there's 0 positives. And if that's true, maybe I should lean more into the things that I am good at and think of ways to be even better at it for a little while. Like, maybe I can come back to the stuff that's not so great once I'm feeling like less of a drainer to others. At least that way I'm not starting from 0. With all the things that I think I do wrong or that bring the vibe down, changing them feels so out of reach. So avoidance and being alone is more accessible and usually the choice I make. I just feel like I have more of a chance in getting somewhere if it's something I know how to do. Like I know I'm a good listener, but im not a good sharer. I think I wanna try building on being a good listener - asking more engaging questions or identifying the times it's better to not ask questions and leave space for people to open up more. Notice when I'm being a good listener and observe it curiously. Instead of tearing apart all the ways I shared \"wrong\" and feeding the vicious loop in my head. At least that way I'm doing something, even if it's not fixing the problem I want to. Its not like I'm fixing it now, in fact I think I'm only making it worse. \n\nThis is a new thought so haven't used it irl yet but I don't know, feels like I'm onto something.",

As someone wrote, depression is a problem of the brain and the brain is an organ of your body. So, it is a physical problem you're going through. Similarly people with other pains and issues have similar behaviours and it has nothing to do with who you are.   \nThe situation, believe me, is temporary. Being depressed is a life-altering experience and it is a black hole of energy, firstly for ourselves. You might have seen how difficult it is some days to even get out of bed or do even the simplest activities.   \nOther people might be unable to help and that's because it is not something we are used to see and approach in life. Nobody is taught what mental health is and how we could help others or even seek help.   \nHow you behave is right and is a symptom of what you're going through: you're not deliberately trying to be hostile. It is how you are feeling and you have all the rights to be in this way. Please, do not feel like you have to put up a show for others or be around others because \"that's what I SHOULD do\". Do not do things you think you SHOULD, MUST, HAVE TO, do. Do what you feel like doing: it is your body telling you you need space and that you are able to engage with the world outside in the way you do. Take your time, listen to yourself, love yourself, and you'll find again the joy of being around others. It is only a temporary situation. People will be there again for you and with you whenever you feel the need - and if not them you'll make new friends, have new people around you who fit better with who you are and are also able to appreciate what you go through, without expectations or without grudging. Take it easy and just be yourself. You'll start feeling more comfortable within your own skin once you stop worrying about others. What matters now is you, others will be around you at their own will and support you as much as they can. much love.",

I have a family of my own and some friends and can't help but feel like my life is a hindrance to them - this often increases my suicidal thoughts tenfold!\n\nI'd like to think that the people who do stuck around really care and just want us to get better, but fuck me it must be difficult for them. \n\nTaking acid and smoking weed definitely gave me more perspective on how others perceive me - however, I also wonder if it makes me more paranoid, so the thoughts I'm having are in my own fucked up head. \n\nI think the drugs and having mental health issues is the reason you feel like a 'blackhole'.

My husband and I let two of our closest friends stay with us for a while last year, and I honestly feel like my depression almost ruined our friendship. Before moving in, they never truly saw the pain I suffered on a daily basis, because my home was a private sanctuary where I could let everything out without judgment. They even asked me if I considered going back on my medication, which made me feel like they couldn't be friends with me unless I was medicated. I no longer believe this, but I do believe there is a process we face with opening up and sharing what we feel inside.\n\nI want to talk, and in reality I need to talk about it, but at the same time, I do not want to burden others. When I finally do talk about it, I wonder if they want to push me away or if they truly understand. There is a possibility, however, that they do not understand, because it is difficult for even me to understand. I think people's gut reaction is to say things like \"well, it could be worse,\" \"it's not that bad,\" or \"why do you feel that way?\" They don't realize that the first two questions invalidate what we're feeling, and that the answer to the \"why\" in the moment they ask could very well be, well, everything. \n\nI think our friends do care, and they do want to help, but sometimes they just don't know how. The last friend I opened up to, I just explained my fears regarding their reaction and feeling like a burden. I also explained the common phrases and question I get, and how they make me feel. In a way, you're telling them what you need, what you don't need, and why you have reservations. This helped my friend not only better understand what I was going through, but also helped them understand that I didn't want them to fix me; in so many words, I needed to let the demons out, and in that moment I needed someone who wouldn't be scared by those demons as they left me.",

And often they still love you, but do it from a distance to protect themselves. Or they move on. And after it drags on for years and years and the one depressed doesn\u2019t act in any way to help themselves, then that point comes. And like OP says, I don\u2019t blame them. It happened to me. And it was my worst point, until I saw myself and exactly why people did not want to be around me and started to really unweave the depression victim mentality that I fed into.\n\nHowever, the ones that matter come back when you fight for yourself, for them, and your recovery. I lost most my friends. Lost touch with family. But the ones that matter are glad to see me on the mend and are major parts of my life again. I\u2019m miles above from where I was at my worst. To expect unconditional love and support from people to fight for me when I can\u2019t offer that to myself or even any of them would be hypocritical. \n\nI think both points have merit here, it\u2019s hard to judge yourself when you are depressed, yet alone the intentions of others\u2019 actions towards you when your sense of self is fucked. Best of luck in things",

It is very painful if you dont realize you are just a pillar of hopelessnes and suck every possible joy from their life. After I realize this truth about myself,I understand them, for example 2-3 years ago one of my close friends open to his crush and started a relationships with her and come to me to tell how he excited and happy and wonder whats next for them and me as a emotion's black hole cant understand his feelings or care and tell him how  economy is bad and it is hard to be in relationship while everything so expensive and that day how awful I feel about myself so he become frusturated.Now,fewer people around me and im glad that they dont leave me but also understand people that leave me and try to not feel angry. \n\nAlso yesterday one of my bff tell me how he had little joy from life and everyday he needs to pull himself together to handle his life and when he meets meI suck his precious joy of life and causing him to hate life and I understand him totally. Today, his thoughts made me getting up my bed and try to smile and I believe sometimes I need the hard truths to continue and thats what I appreciate about his friendship since he is always honest and reliable to me.",

I truly  feel  uncomfortable and unwanted  in all spaces, and rejection is one of my biggest triggers, as if life has a tendency of showing me a theme of misery and misunderstanding, question is am I the cause or is it due to the company I keep,  hard to tell.",

I ghosted even the people I loved the most because I didn\u2019t want them to be poisoned by coming into contact with my depression. I even left my wife because I wanted to save her from becoming collateral damage. I ended up homeless, sitting on top of the highest mountain in New Mexico. I had felt lonely before, but it was really about as far as a person can take self-imposed isolation. It was here that I finally understood the innate human quality of being a pack animal. I resolved to be brutally honest with myself and others, from that point on. The consistent honesty meant that when I connected with another monkey, I developed trust with them quickly and intensely. It also made it obvious when a relationship was incompatible (platonic or romantic) and I could move on without being stuck in bad situations. My newly developed trust in a select few made me a truly integrated pack animal, which makes me feel whole. It\u2019s okay to know that I need others. Most of my newer close friends suffer with deep depression. We got close by being unafraid to be open about our problems from the very first conversation. None of us felt that we were awful to be around. Depression was actually what helped bond us together.",

But if you know who they are, just know they still wish the best things for you. And for you, try and change up the day and do the things your depression says you\u2019ll hate. If your at home dealing with depression when it\u2019s a nice day, dont do that. Force yourself out. Stick to your plans with people who want to see you. Catch yourself when you know you regret the things you say. Don\u2019t regret the things you say and dwell, rather apologize and move on. Your depression can turn into quick anger, and I know it\u2019s crap. And if your stuck at home at night reading this, thinking I have to do something with my life but I can\u2019t. Go play yourself an online game, talk to people don\u2019t just play the game. You don\u2019t know how memorable some of my Garry\u2019s mod nights were before I had my car, just some of the best people right there on sandbox. Even something dumb like Roblox can fill a hole for a while before you can go back out there.",

You don't wanna move away but for ur own sanity u need space ik people should be there for you but what if you are trying to help them and they don't take it .you kinda feel like you are causing the pain so u move away. Also from the side where I have depression ik when I was always sad a lot I know it hurt the people I loved the most and how mentally draining it is for them. Thing is they are not entitled to be there forever if they are also hurting them mentally and making them depressed. But overall i do see both sides of wanting the people to be there for u and that people move away.",

    "postText": "I've suffered from depression for many years. This week, after reading Codependent No More, my spouse and I have had many difficult discussions that have made me realize that I have come to accept this as my life and that I really need more help. I've agreed to IOP starting next week and marriage counseling. But all week he has been saying hurtful things about me, my habits, how I contribute nothing to the relationship, how his wants and needs aren't met, etc. He's also been so controlling- pushing me really hard to do things when he says they'll help (daily walks, more showering, scheduling my weekends full) but I feel like he's pushing too hard and going to burn me out. He uses guilt and shame to get me to do these things. He keeps saying things that insinuate that just because I'm going to get help doesn't mean our relationship will work. All of it feels so out of character for him, when he is usually supportive. He has a mental health history too and I spent years as the \"normal\" partner trying to make things work when he wasn't able to do anything. He's also bipolar so I thought maybe this uncharacteristic cruelty and controlling behavior was a manic episode but he says its not. He's saying that Codependent No More has made him realize that he needs to speak his truth and that he needs to \"use the stick instead of the carrot\". I feel like he has unrealistic expectations for me, that he wants me to become a very specific person in order to meet his needs (including losing weight that I've gained while depressed) and if I don't then he will leave. I've known that he feels unhappy and that I'm not a very good partner right now but I have been trying, I just couldn't see that I wasn't making any progress. Now its like he's at the end of his rope and even though I've agreed (and am hopeful and excited) to participate in IOP and marriage counseling that he's already decided I'll never be able to be what he needs me to be. He says all of it is because he loves me and wants me to be happy but it doesn't feel that way. This week has been terrible. He's said things that have made me cry more times this week than in our whole 9 year relationship.  It's like I don't even know him....I feel crazy. My mom saw some of his behaviors and she and my sister feel that he is bullying me. I don't know if this is just a phase of resentment and anger that he needs to get through but it is so painful. I might have needed to hear some hard truths but now that I've agreed to treatment, where is my kind, supportive spouse? Is he gone forever? Am I really a terrible, toxic person that deserves this treatment? Is it punishment for me being mean sometimes when he was not well? I don't know what I want from this post, I'm just in turmoil and hurting so badly.",

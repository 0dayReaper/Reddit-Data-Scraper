    "postText": "It has been 6 months since my tremors started. They were very rare and strong, unpredictable, caused by thoughts and memories. I have been to a psychologist and she told me that if they continue to increase and cause me angry, I should consider therapy (medication). I haven't been diagnosed with any mental disorder, but based on my symptoms, I think I might have anxiety, depression, or restless agitation, something along those lines.\r  \n\r  \nMy concern is that medication will dull my mind, and as a musician, I won't have creativity anymore. I am in the middle of my career.\r  \n\r  \nIn recent days, it has been very difficult for me to stay calm. I feel like my hands have a lot of power, and my blood wants to burst out. When those impulses come, it feels like a surge of adrenaline, and it originates from the bottom of my stomach and shoots into my hands. My body can't stay still but makes uncontrollable movements for about 1 second, similar to someone hiding behind a door trying to scare you.\r  \n\r  \nIs there anyone here who has gone through or is going through this phase?",

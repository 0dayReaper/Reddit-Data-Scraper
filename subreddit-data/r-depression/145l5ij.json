I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even looking for advice, just wanted to tell somebody what\u2019s going on because my agoraphobia has gotten to the point where I\u2019m literally too scared to speak to my family or friends. \n\nRight now I\u2019m charging my phone in my car before I voluntarily commit myself to a hospital in Florida where I live. It\u2019s gotten to the point that im so depressed and exhausted that I literally can\u2019t do anything. I can\u2019t take care of myself. I can\u2019t even make myself eat three meals a day much less one. I can\u2019t make myself shower daily. The only time I fully wake myself up out of sleep is to go to work where I drag my feet for eight hours until I can clock out and sleep some more. I can\u2019t take care of my child, when I\u2019m off work I either put on kids shows on tv for him or leave him with the babysitter because she can take better care of him than I. I can\u2019t take care of my husband, he\u2019s tired of me being barely a person. Please just wish me luck and cross your fingers that this helps me. Love you all.",

Now my family has moved away and even though the kids are older there are different challenges that are overwhelming me. Both of them don't have any real friends and all they want to do is stay inside and play video games. And I feel like I failed them , I didn't raise them to be social enough.. or athletic.. and I'm afraid they're going to end up with my mental health crap. Parenting is so hard. I don't think I have the strength most days.\nI think it's great you're getting help now while your son is still young. Kids are resilient and he won't remember much. There's that saying with the oxygen mask.. how you have to help yourself first. And then you can be more present for him. My daughter, the 11 year old, has asked me why I'm always so sad. It breaks my heart, I need to hide it better. I know she'll remember these moments of her mom forever.",

They won't keep you long at all if you aren't in a life-threatening crisis. The psych ward isn't for long-term solutions. They might give you a couple benzos to calm you down, but that's very unlikely, too. They won't start you on any long-term meds like SSRI's. You have to do that with a psych doctor. I know this from experience. I've been to like 7 psych wards over the years. Also, keep in mind that committing yourself voluntarily does not mean you get to leave when you want to. If they consider you a danger to yourself or others they will involuntarily commit you if you try to leave. They can keep you for up to 72 hours by law regardless for observation if they admit you.",

I l just spent weeks upon weeks...not brushing my hair and going to the bathroom on myself a few times... i literally felt like a waste and not worthy of any love from anyone, especially myself.... idk if you suffered any emotional trauma as a kid or past trauma if any kind but that is 100 percent the culprit... the longer it lies dormant ... the worse it will do to your mind and your body... my case... since I came out of the womb I was severely abused by a narc sociopath mother who was only 18 at the time so I got tossed between her and my even worse Grandma....sick sick fucking people...derranged insidious disgusting parasitic people that exist as a shell...black to the core... any who... i have not processed any emotions and now in my 30s... i literally have developed a leg wound that hasnt healed in 2 years and depression so deep .... i have a inner voice that literally was programed inside of me by these psychos... i fight with it every moment ... im full of shame and self doubt and feel perrified and full of anxiety thinking about doing any tasks to get better and the guilt I feel as a mom and wife in this state is horrifying....  yesterday i decided to get up and take a shower... let me tell you... i have always been super self care .... i mean to the max... one of my favorite things is makeup..clothes..\nHair... i have let my once beautiful thick gleaming hair roll into a knot of eternal rats nests..as my mom used to tell me constantly growing up... I have to be a big girl and get up for life... i have to ... i want to... i wont let them win anynore. I have value and I love my babies ans husband to death... they are my world and if mommy shows how to be down and depressed and give up on life then Im not breaking any generational trauma at all... but if mommy shows that she is strong and brave and can face anything... kids follow suit... kids dont listen to what you say so much, actions is what they mirror.... always... actions mean more....  I cant curl up in a ball anymore....  the little child in me has to go away and be a big girl that meets her own needs and battles the demons because she is fucking strong. Good luck my friend, you just comitting yourself is the first step.... you can do this... pull it from the depts of your deepest aching heart... get that shit out....  fight for your fucking self. I will if you will. We are worth it. We deserve to have love and happiness and everything in between. We deserve life. We have a story to tell....  all my love... stay in the moment.. find what makes you...YOU... follow and make your path by what your intent and principles are..... we need a rough draft because ours got thrown out by a bunch of heartless evil shits... xoxoxo",

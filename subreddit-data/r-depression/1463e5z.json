    "postText": "I'm wanting to though but logically if n afterlife exists all that waits for me afterwards is varying degrees of punishment, I didn't really want to before I just got so into my own head I felt and knew it was wrong and should have ended there, but I also thought it might be best given the harm I'd done to others during my period of madness. I explained this to a psychiatrist she sided with me having worsening depression and gave me an antipsychotic, instead of a therapist so I could get to work through the conflict as I was slowly over a week with Strattera getting to feeling like myself and able to have empathy that I felt which kept me from suicide as I also had the stable mood to know that suicide wouldn't do anything productive or solve anything in other words. \n\nI just wanting to get the intrusive thoughts to stop dragging me down, I didn't ask for something so strong that it would change me so thoroughly, I wish I stuck with my gut instinct (something that also has been killed) and refused to take it, seeking a second opinion instead of assuming I needed to trust and at least try it, I tried it and immediately two weeks in decline occured. I did dial back thinking maybe it was too much at once and took lesser portions, even still after a month when I finally said \"enough\" and quit for awhile I was diminished mentally but still able to tap into what I could with effort, I thought I needed it because I started to experience worse delusions than before the pill, I had anxiety and OCD so delusions weren't new. \n\nWhich brings me to the present day, I want to be killed as I feel like what I aspired to do with IT so I could be of service to people, good at doing so and contributing to make others people's lives easier is gone and just dead. I'm only going to be able to contribute not as a creative person or through invention as I dreamed of being an inventor since I was seven years old and found software development was close enough, I can at most be a cog in the machine not in any intellectual and fulfilling way for me but rather just some common muscle making a low income wishing I could do more as I once used to be able to without having to compensate for loss of brain function that I don't know how to work with as before I just could make the connections in my head without writing much if anything down in a notepad or on paper when I start ambitious projects and started the design phase first, from frontend user interface, to multiple system interfacing links from communication over encrypted ssh to a virtual private server or the multiple branching code paths necessary to allow someone to use a physical server they own with the software system I planned on making. \n\nI was once able to see how each individual facet had multiple layers from the data storage implementation that I wanted to replace with a standard SQL database format that I got overwhelmed with anxiety because ADHD started acting up, which would have a folder for each discord server, followed by a folder for each supported game, if the game was ARK survival evolved there would be subfolders for clusters or better yet I would have each server tied to the specific user and then have cluster folders or just the ark server configuration that would be used to generate the steamcmd args.txt thing that gets passed to steamcmd to install the game server, the next step being to generate either the .sh for Linux or the .cmd file for windows to launch the game server with the appropriate launch args. I planned on finding a parser or writing my own for the actual game server configuration files that don't accept the options being passed in as command line arguments.\n\nLong story short my brain doesn't flow and automatically generate making programming as natural as I had managed to get it to be after highschool, I had it be pretty naturally flowing aside from abstracts and such but eventually I managed to get those to flow in too, only time I experienced disruption that temporarily rendered me incapable in a way like this to where I just blank has been anxiety overwhelming me.\n\nI know I am being petty and there are people who don't even have an option to be capable of supporting themselves to the degree I still can do so, the only reason I ask for death is I feel like a promising life was stolen from me thanks to lies and misinformation from a medical professional that should have known better. I'm tired of people just thinking I'm unintentionally making this up, I'm not this isn't some rose turned glasses nostalgia phenomenon, it's severe enough to be real evident at best temporary but long lasting disruption, to at worst permanent dysfunction that I have to deal with and have to accept I never will be able to do what I used to be able to again, if the latter is reality I would rather die than only be able to know how to do something but never the how and why of something.\n\nI want to get back to being me able to break down how things work and why they are how they are, not just be a mindless machine that follows instructions, I want to be human again.",

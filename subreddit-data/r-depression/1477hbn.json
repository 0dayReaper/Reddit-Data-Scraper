    "postText": "I am truly feeling hopeless today. \n\nMy best friend and I are trying to find an apartment to move into together. We are both on disability, so we have very limited income (a little less than $2,500 combined monthly income) and neither of us have very good credit (under 600 for both of us). \n\nWhere we live, even studio apartments want over $1k a month, in our city and in pretty much all the surrounding towns. Most are asking for credit scores over 620 or better with income 3x the rent that normally totals around $4,500. \n\nI am also currently in a lease that I didn't realize auto-renewed for a year on 4/1. I thought it had been month to month because my current landlord still has not had me sign a new lease for this year (she has it now, backdated to 4/1, and wants it signed by this coming Thursday). This means I have 10 months left on my current lease, and I don't know what she will want or require for me to break my lease early when we do eventually find a place and I am ready to move out (there are several issues with where I am living now including but not limited to my landlord charging me $100 extra my last month of my old lease because she had to raise rent to cover rising utility costs which I just KNOW was illegal). \n\nWe are having an *extremely* hard time finding an affordable apartment, that isn't a slum, that meets some specific needs for both of us due to our physical and mental illnesses. While, yes, we both technically have a safe place to stay while we're looking neither of us particularly wants to stay where we are for too much longer. \n\nI know the rental market sucks for everyone right now, but we are especially susceptible to the stress of the difficulties of it due to a few factors. Neither of us handles stress well, we can't live with strangers due to our mental illnesses, we both have environmental overstimulation issues, and living with family for extended periods of time is not an option (they can temporarily stay with theirs, I can't stay with mine at all). \n\nThis is all to say...I am feeling extremely hopeless. I don't know what to do. I feel like eventually we'll find a place, but I'm afraid we'll be settling for something we don't actually want that will end up exacerbating one or both of our mental illnesses. Plus the financial burden of my situation is terrifying. I have no idea how to get out of it unscathed, especially with my no money. \n\nSo, yeah. I'm not sure if I want advice, or just emotional support.",

    "postText": "I give everything up for my friends family and work. I\u2019m in the hole when it comes to time off because of taking my wife to doctors appointments. My company allows -80 hours and I am nowhere near that. I\u2019ve had a vacation on the calendar for months and my boss just said you aren\u2019t going on vacation next week because you\u2019re in the hole. I NEEDED this but now I can\u2019t go\u2026. I really just want to go home and shoot myself in the fucking head and be free from everything. Free from depression, free from responsibility, free from everything\u2026.. and the worst part is I can\u2019t even talk to my friends about this because I\u2019ve backed myself into a corner where I help them with their depression but I can\u2019t rely on them helping me\u2026 fuck it.",

I needed detox, rehab, then AA. Almost 6 years sober now. Ask for help, go to detox, then go to an AA meeting. I hated myself and was completely a lost cause, if i did it than you can do it.",

It\u2019s up and down. But I take responsibility for how I\u2019m feeling now and don\u2019t just try to escape through drugs. I will say I\u2019m not as involved with AA than I was in the beginning, and I was happier when I was, but things get tricky after being sober for a while (job,relationships,family)",

There was no way I could stop on my own, especially without getting sick so I needed detox. The rest came because I completely surrendered and stopped trying to do things my way, my way always failed and left me miserable. So I listened to the people at detox and went to rehab, then they told me to go to a halfway house so I don\u2019t just go back to using, they told me to go to AA and get a sponsor and do 12 steps. I won\u2019t say it was easy, but it was simple, all I had to do was take the suggestions and not make up excuses. After the steps my mindset changed and I didn\u2019t even wanna get high anymore. Do yourself a favor and ask for help my friend. You\u2019re not alone.",

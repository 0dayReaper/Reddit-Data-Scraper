    "postText": "So I (M22) recently found out that my friend (F24) was in a pretty bad spot at the beginning of the year, but gladly got professional help in a clinic and is now also on antidepressants. We have been on a small weekend trip where we talked a lot and became better friends and now I want to help her see the amazing person she is and help her, but I am not sure how? Would be happy for any feedback.",

            "comment": "Well.. if she\u2019s getting professional help then just be a friend. Sometimes it can be like trying to hold a fist full of sand. The more you squeeze the more escapes. The best thing you can do is just be steady and positive. If she wants to talk about it the great but I would just ask how she\u2019s doing here and there.. I mean be a human, but I wouldn\u2019t make it the focus of everything you do. There will be good days and bad.. don\u2019t make it about you and roll with it. \n\nSo be honest do you have romantic intentions? If so you really might read some books and get a better understanding. Just so you don\u2019t do the do the wrong thing with good intentions. Everyone is different. So no general answer is going to be perfect. \n\nSeems like you mean well and already have a good friendship. Let her know you\u2019re there for her but just keep doing what your doing.",

That is a really good answer. \n\nTo be honest I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m romantically interested, but I know it wouldn\u2019t help her at the moment, so I planned to just sit and wait and see how everything evolves. But I would still love some reading suggestions, it can also be academic.",

You might create a dependency for her to feel good about herself, and you need to think about how this will play out in the long run.\n\nBecause it's based on idealism.\n\nSitting and waiting, is waiting for a disaster to happen. You already know how you feel... Why did you become friends with her in the first place? What was the need? At the very start of it.\n\nThink about her expectations - they might just as well have been the exact same - and how do you feel about it now?\n\nSay you do fall in love with her, and she doesn't feel the same? You'll feel bad if you need to abandon her some point along your way in order to find your happiness. Or if she feels more or less the same, but only in what you're doing for her - how would that make you feel? \n\nShe might seek physical comfort, and that may make things worse because 1) if you have any feelings they will likely be exaggerated by touch, 2) if she seeks physical intimacy and you reject her, she might feel even worse about herself, 3) one party is interested romantically, but the other only in sex.\n\nOf course if she falls in love with you because she appreciates you - then there is nothing wrong in being in a relationship with someone who is depressed. Then you read a book.\n\nBut the important thing here is that you are honest about your own feelings, and move in that direction for yourself.\n\nListen to legion\\_2k",

It depends on the nature of it.\n\nYou have depressing moments in life, periods, you can have depressive tendencies, you can have a depressive disorder, or you can be depressed because of a personality disorder, or a physical disease.\n\nTherapy in changing behaviors, thought patterns and beliefs is the only way - and you can supplement or challenge that, but you can't really control it or convince someone of it. They need to experience the freedom of it themselves, and learn how to get back that freedom.\n\nIn my own depression, I've discovered it sometimes happens when I'm caught in a cognitive loop, because of my personality type. The only way to get out of it, is by executing another function, which may feel very uncomfortable because of past trauma, and me not really being open to it by feeling comfortable in relying on the two other functions.\n\nSo you could try to ask her about her personality type, and look up what kind of loop she might experience, and how you can help her that way.\n\nLike I said, there is nothing wrong with being together with someone with mental health issues, but it's how you would handle it yourself. You want to be there for her, which is noble, but it might also point to a tendency in yourself, to sacrifice yourself to help others.\n\nIf you have a need to help people, you probably can't do anything about that, but you can limit it so it doesn't hurt your feelings. By i.e. choosing activities that are not personally invested in, and being simply friends to friends, and choosing friends that respond to your needs.",

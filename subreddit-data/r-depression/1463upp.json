    "postText": "Some days I'm completely switched off from life, letting everything pass by or fall apart without feeling anything. I don't shower, care if I brush my teeth (trying to fight this bit). I just exist. Other days I complain about everything, actively hate myself, life and get irritated by everything and everyone around me. I shout, I fight a lot and am not a nice person to be around. There are days I'm cold and bitter. There are times that I feel extremely positive about life, but naively, like everything is going to be okay (even when I don't do anything to try and make a positive change). Sometimes I think that I could just launch myself off a balcony or in front of a train and it wouldn't even matter (I'm not suicidal, haven't been for about 6 years, but still get the odd thought.) I'm not even sure who I am as a person. I have dreams, ideas of who I want to be. I don't think I'm a bad person, even think I'm nice and loving and caring, at least on the good days. I get filled with a childlike joy and laugh and cry tears of joy. Sometimes I'm all of those things in the same day. It's exhausting. I don't even know if what I'm describing is depression. I've been in a relationship for close to 5 years now and I can feel it's coming to an end, parts of me even want it to for different reasons. I'm 25 and the better part of my life when I should be living well has been consumed by this. I'm going to go back on meds soon and start therapy. I need to figure out who I am.",

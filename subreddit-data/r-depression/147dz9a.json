    "postText": "I'm finding comfort in my routine. My routine is VERY toxic though. I don't want to go into specifics other than I definitely overindulge in things I shouldn't to numb myself from feeling and dealing with things every day for nearly the past almost seven years. My main responsibilities are taken care of, and I work almost full time so there is a little hope in my humanity, but my biggest issue is I don't care about anything. I'm 29. I've felt this way for so long. I don't believe in myself or have any confidence anymore. I simply exist and am *here*. I don't really know, I just feel sad deep down because I'd like to be normal, but the inability to believe in myself and have discipline (mostly raised myself) and the lack of motivation? I am insufferable and it's my own fault. I self-sabotage almost every single day. I'm still young and capable but yet - there's a force beyond my legs moving and my brain critically working toward these things - the betterment of myself - that keeps me from doing, and I feel this steady decline instead. Like I'm getting worse. I've gained ten pounds since October, and a majority of that is from this year. I got divorced in* October and that really put me off track because now I'm suddenly responsible for just myself and since now I'm the only person I have to consider day-to-day, and not caring about oneself/trying, and winning in life don't work together - and it's made me far worse when back during that time I was feeling like this major change would really push me toward something better; physically, mentally, emotionally..\n\nIt's been a spiral of self doubt, anger, bipolar disorder, major depressive episodes, and my recent failed relationship that keeps me in the same state of mind, unable to believe it could be great. If I just try.\n\nThis sucks. Anyone dealing with depression for any reason, I am so sorry. I don't wish this burden on anyone.",

It must have, because you were pumped to go out. \n\nassuming it did, imagine how you would feel doing it every other day. When I feel miserable, I purposely take a shower to at least feel somewhat productive and good about myself. It builds my confidence. It makes it easier to socialize. So even tho this pandemic is hitting, it\u2019s a good opportunity to practice self care and self love which in turn will make life easier in the future. You want to have a habit of good hygiene set if you want to engage in relationships. \n\nAlso, if anything, we are all in this together. It might feel lonely, but i\u2019ve noticed that people are banding together in communities more to lift spirits up. Try and find a way (such as a community fb group) to pitch in to support ppl. In my area, people are supporting seniors who need help getting supplies from the store. Once again, your hygiene would need to be top notch for this to prevent spread.\n\nNot being able to go out today doesn\u2019t mean things are over for you. You can work on other parts of your life and figure out how you fit into your community. There\u2019s huge opportunity to build networks and friendships thru this catastrophe thats hitting. We all need one another.",

Well if you didn\u2019t shower today - then that\u2019s completely ok too though!! Once you create a habit of it, it will get easier but you don\u2019t have to force yourself to do it. Depression sucks. You\u2019ve battled half the demon though by getting a haircut and showering last week....you were able to actually motivate your mind to do that. Once this blows over....you will already have done some of that internal work on yourself and you will be miles ahead of where you used to be. I think you\u2019re simultaneously feeling defeated and anxious, and i don\u2019t blame you. But recognize that these are temporary emotions guided by temporary situations. To put things into perspective - everyone is in lockdown. We have all had to put our lives aside. We all have to part ways with friends. We all have to isolate. This isn\u2019t happening just to you because only bad things happen to you - this is happening to all of us. There are people who were expecting babies, people expecting birthday parties, people expecting new jobs, people who wanted to go on vacation. This is not about you only. And i want to so deeply emphasize that because like I said, our communities are going to have to band together to overcome this. Where i live, people have already begun to be friendlier to one another, more open to helping. It is bringing out our compassion. You will find the helpers in this chaos. Maybe you\u2019ll become one yourself.\n\nPs i hope i wasn\u2019t too harsh in this. I wasn\u2019t trying to offend you in any way shape or form \u2764\ufe0f. I can tell that you are just tired of being alone, rightfully so. Just wanted to provide some feedback that popped into my head. Feel free to ignore if you want to lol!",

But that's what you've got now. Make a little effort each day to take care of yourself, go for a walk in a nearby park and see others doing the same. Slowly build some daily routines and selfcare into your daily habits again and when this whole lockdown thing blows over, you'll hopefully feel better about yourself, already having developed that habit of selfcare that makes it a bit easier to be social.",

            "comment": "ProTip: Counterintuitive as it may seem, go take a BEGINNER social dance class--salsa, swing, etc. (after the Corona outbreak cools down).  \n\n\nReason: The average 1-hour dance class pairs up people in a circle and has you switch partners every 1-2 minutes. Each time you're able to say, \"Hi, I'm so &amp; so\" and they do likewise without any subtext, flirtiness or awkwardness. You're both in it together, clumsy, patient, and helpful, and for a very short time in each other's arms in a totally non-sexualized way.   \n\n\nThe warmth of close human contact without the hang-ups and uncertainties of dating is almost miraculous if you've been depressed or socially avoidant. In a beginner class everyone is clumsy with no idea what the hell they're doing and so totally without judgement.   \n\n\nLaughter comes easily and you get to be supportive of THEM as much as enjoying a novel situation without risk of harsh judgment of YOU.  \n\n\nTruly this is by far the BEST, most enjoyable, easily available way I've found to reconnect with human touch and close, nurturing contact when you're feeling low, isolated, dejected, or unloved. No one goes there with an agenda except learning how to dance and have fun doing so. Plus getting out of your head and into your body for an hour feels phenomenal.  \n\n\nWhether you like dance or not, this really is an incredible way to wake up a hibernating side of yourself and plug back into some vitality. And with most 1-hr. classes at about $15, an absolute therapeutic bargain.",

I used to teach photography to a terminally ill teenager and it was so cool to watch them get totally enamored in fining a cool way to shoot a subject. With all their health issues swirling around their life and the keen awareness they probably wouldn't live long, they still had a tremendous capacity to be interested and engaged in something they liked and look forward to doing it again next week.  \n\n\nIt's natural to hurt and fear and despair--life has much unavoidable suffering. BUT we often convince ourselves that's ALL it has, or that finding moments of joy is denialist, irresponsible, or betrays our fellow suffering humans. But that's not the slightest bit helpful to them and denying oneself the available joys you'd wish for everyone else who can't have them we sometimes embrace a contradiction...that what \"good\" we'd wish for others we don't feel worthy of ourselves. This is as mistaken as if the starving third world child felt they didn't \"deserve\" food as much as you do.   \n\n\nWhile I don't know the details of what you wrestle with personally, I do know that despair can be reduced by finding interests and mustering the willingness to jump into them and swim awhile in fascination. It's every human's birthright regardless of the inescapable pain and mortality among us and within us.  \n\n\nFind something shiny... Something you unapologetically take interest in... And dare to tune out care for what anybody else thinks of it and just drink your fill when you can. Remember: a \"successful\" life isn't about not dying or being admired; it's about enjoying one's limited ride one's own way to the fullest extent available. Free yourself to chase and enjoy yours.",

Cuz I had dreams and used to get scared of it, had a lot of hallucinations and I even thought of committing suicide, my studies had gone into the gutters(it's still the same), but at the end when I went to school I became more depressed, while some ppl cared for me it didn't lasts for that long uk. I became the same guy being ignored by the people for some reason. But I saw myself deep down inside, that I was becoming mature that's cuz before this I used to be a attention wh*re who used  to do fuck*d up shit to get ppl near me but I told to myself not  anymore. In the first place I started thinking abt it while I was at home the whole month and I realized I have been alone (lonely actually) my whole fu*king life. Some ppl are actually good friends of mine but I try to be with the ppl and help others that has just broken my soul in a way that I am trying to heal myself from it. Ik  I am not a celebrity but even I sometimes need ppl who actually care abt me, not who just wanna know cuz of their Curiousness uk.... \nSo friend if u think u are alone don't think so, if u don't wanna go out that's just cuz of being scared, believe me when I go out I see ppl staring back at me, and I feel like was he staring at me or somebody else, I mean that Kind of feeling should be avoided cuz you are a man of ur own and nobody can take your identity away from u. U can also just go out and stay near ur house to have a good breeze of fresh air(in the morning ofc). At the end I would say ppl get up everyday in the whole world cuz they have hope that something new(or bad which is actually challenging) will happen to them and they will enjoy and fight it respectively, cuz m8 all we have in our lives is to just HOPE that some day our life turns out to be a little better.",

Don't go out. \n\nYou ever feel depressed and sometimes just one word, a song, a phone call, a gesture, etc knocks you right out of it? \n\nThat's the secret to controlling this demon, because you will never beat it, don't even try. It's here to teach you something. Embrace it and learn from it, because it will give you strength like you've never known... if you don't fight it. \n\nFind your own ways of fine tuning it and you'll see what I mean. \n\nI'm depressed and anxious everyday. Sometimes I have the most irrational thoughts, but I force myself to make fun of them and laugh out loud. When I'm down? I nurture myself. \n\nYou don't have to do anything you don't want to. \n\nMany introverts prefer to focus on the mind and not the body. Many geniuses couldn't care less to exercise. \n\nTherapists push you to become a functional person within the system. Do you want to be one? \nI don't. I like the way I am and I own my own house and business. I control my life and my depression helps me lift the bullshit veil on society.",

Now I\u2019m stuck in the house 24/7 and all social events are cancelled. \n\nSelf-isolation was my main issue in regards to my depression. And the moment I decide to start being more social, the government tells us to practice social distancing lol! It\u2019s frustrating because I finally started being comfortable with people. I just fear that I\u2019m going make 10 steps backward in my progress.",

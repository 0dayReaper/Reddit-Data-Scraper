    "postText": "I took the tablets. I wasn't expecting them to do much besides make me feel miserable enough to go to hospital. From there, I'd get help. I figured atleast. \n\nI woke my dad up, told him what I had done and asked him to take me. \n\nHe said and I quote \"You'll be fine. I feel like shit too\" after I explained to him why I took them. \nHe messaged me a bit afterwards about how he feels bad. Not about me, about him. \n\nHonestly I'm just dreading tomorrow now. I've never told my parents about how bad my mental health is and now I'm going to have to face their questions. \n\nDeep down, I knew he wouldn't help. That's why I never told them.\n\nI guess now it's just up to me again to try harder. \n\nAll that drama and I just feel disappointed. I've always been there for my dad. I've always asked him if he's okay, I listened, offered advice, let him complain to me about everything. It has caused me so much stress being his emotional support animal but now that I need help, he doesn't give a shit.\n\nFor the record, I feel physically fine besides a funky stomach. I don't regret taking the tablets though. I just regret telling my dad I did.",

Needless to say, that\u2019s when I never went back xD therapy can really help if you find the right people though. When you are feeling down, write in a journal and then take it with you. It will help you explain how you were feeling in those moments.",

For example I might write something down the day before my appointment, but the next day I'll read it and be like \"nah, what was I even writing, that's not me, not how I feel\". I feel like a completely different person from one day to another, and it's difficult for me to describe how I felt etc. I might have been miserable for a month but if on the day I talk to her I feel fine, that's how she's gonna perceive me.\n\nOften times later during the night I start writing weird philosophical shit and the next day in the morning I would be so confused by myself.\n\nI guess that's not completely relevant to you.",

The first week of doing that was amazing. I hadn't realized how horrible I was feeling all. the. time. Looking at those entries, I also felt pretty strong, too. I hadn't realized how horrible I was feeling because I was making such an effort to be positive and find joy in the little things and I kind of assumed I was doing okay overall even though the day-to-day life was really sucking. I was constantly fighting myself to maintain a positive attitude and it was exhausting. It also helped me make the decision to go on meds, because I saw that I really was making a conscious, cognitive effort to be positive and move past things but I just couldn't. I've only been on meds a week so I'm hoping they'll start to bridge that gap soon.",

See if you can find a good therapist, they can make a huge difference in helping you feel validated and heard. Might take some googling around -- look at reviews and testimonials and ratings and stuff.",

In the moment you may feel upset and betrayed. You start questioning why your friend wouldnt just call it off. Do they not care about you? You are confused now, because you also have known them for a long time so you want to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe you even get mad at yourself for questioning your friend or possibly for allowing yourself to get in this position in the first place. All the while you are feeling lonely and vulnerable.\n\nMost people in that situation would just say they feel hurt.\n\nEmotions are more like a knotted ball of string than the clear defined lines we make them out to be. Sometimes it takes picking at different parts before we start to figure out how we feel the way we feel and why.",

I love writing in it and creating new spreads and carry it with me everywhere, so whenever I want to write but don't want to get too far ahead of myself in my calendar, I just start hitting down symptoms and things I notice in my everyday. When I have bad panic attacks I usually send reaaaally long texts to my husband and I can go back and screenshot or transcribe them later once I've calmed down. \n\nI always forget SOMEthing when I'm there, though. No way around that. But if I remember soon after I leave, I jot it down really quick for next time! \n\nI also write notes from the sessions themselves in there, too. Certain key words and recommendations for different cbt tools or phrases that'll help me communicate how I feel better. Keeping it all in the same place makes it easy to both keep track of what's going on and to quickly reference healthy coping strategies.\n\nBut I have also been in therapy for YEARS and understand that it is a very important tool for me to use bc I'm awful at holding myself accountable and having a professional and objective third party that I see regularly that knows the things I need to get done is VERY helpful. But I've definitely lapsed and thought \"I'm good\" and then 4 months later I'm like... Oh nvm. I rly need therapy. \n\n(But I also understand it isn't for everyone!

I\u2019ll also sometimes just say when I have a hard time. Like \u201chey, so my brain is super foggy today and I\u2019m struggling but I don\u2019t know why.\u201d Then we can sorta work together on what I want to get out of the session. \n\nFor people who have had bad therapists, I get it. I have seen 6 over the years, and I really only clicked with 2, and 2 others were straight up bad at their jobs. I find that I prefer a social worker, and I also find it helps to be super upfront during the first session. For example, I told my current therapist that I don\u2019t like it when the professional talks to much about their own experiences or is just nodding/silence, I need a balance. I told her I do like homework, but meditation isn\u2019t my thing. And it has worked out beautifully.\n\nObviously it\u2019s tricky because if you haven\u2019t really been to therapy much you can\u2019t say what you like.  You can sort of guess based on how you like to communicate with others. You can also say \u201cso I\u2019m new to therapy, and I don\u2019t know what kind of preferences I have yet. Can we check in during our __ session and see if there should be changes? \n\nI\u2019m a mental health professional, and I see therapy as a tool. I absolutely love it, and I think a lot of people will benefit with the right fit. But that fit is crucial, and it takes time to build rapport. There are other tools as well, including medication, meditation, group therapy, time with friends, lifestyle changes etc. It\u2019s all about what fits with your needs. \n\nTLDR: Advocate for yourself. Tell the therapist what you need or if you are having a hazy day. They work for you.",

Writing down what has been going on is useful from session to session. Same with just saying whatever you are feeling in that moment or any type of thought- sometimes that can lead to more content even when your brain is mucky if you have a good guide. \n\nAs the client, you lead the session and I have found that to hold pressure, especially in the beginning sessions. I think that is when it is the most difficult to share my experience. Sometimes I would just want to say something, anything, but unable to even think about how I would do this- it can be overwhelming to attempt to summarize your experience especially when it is over years. However, what I have learned is that my experience is gradually built and understood as sessions go on.\n\nI also read a couple of comments of frustration regarding WHERE the depression is coming from, which is usually not useful if you are having reoccurring episodes. I think a good way to find an effective therapist is to ask/read about what modalities they are trained in! Some modalities are completely focused on the present, while others hold that something from the past is influencing how your mental health is currently. I like to research what they practice :-P",

That's all I can think of.\n\nWhen I sat in the chair across the nurse's table for initial assessment, I had to do the breathing exercise before I could speak. The tears were nearly falling and I can't breathe, and I didn't want to share anything with the doctor. At the same time, I was asking myself \"why am I here in the first place?\"",

She actually made me even more forgetful because she was only paying attention to certain things I said, interrupt me, then tells me to talk more about the thing.\nShe even had me schedule 4 appointments that day, saying I need to go to all of them. When I asked her what was the usual protocol for rescheduling if I can't make it to one, she lectured me about cancelling appointments and how one of her depressed patients cancelled on her and she said \"Well that's not going to help them, is it?\"\nAnd guess what? They rescheduled me 3 times and cancelled 1. So I stopped seeing her. I learned nothing and she only showed me coping techniques that I already told her I did (breathing exercise and journaling) and I still had to pay hundreds of dollars for that one day.",

My first meeting with her she asked me questions and I sat there saying \"I don't know\" because that was all that came out. In my head I was answering her questions but when I opened my mouth the answers didn't come out. Also this happened when I went through that process that you have to explain why you are here. I couldn't say \"I'm depressed and I was crying everyday and I thought about suicide everyday.\" Instead I said \"My mom said I should come here.\" I mean it was true my mom did say I should go see a new therapist since I didn't have one at the moment but I couldn't say anything else when they continued to ask me why was I there.

One of them is essential oils. Certain ones are very soothing, they have a powerful effect on your brain in a unique way only scent can. \n\nAnother is my diet. I've been vegan, drinking a ton of homemade organic fruit/vegetable juices and also using an infrared sauna device nearly daily. The IR detox is closer along the lines of exercise really, but I feel like those things help me release the underlying toxicity that brings me down.\n\nI'd be happy to tell you more about any of these protocols if you're interested.\n\n",

The oils are super distilled plants with no other additives and what's left is the chemical components that make the plant unique and it's unique scent. Technically there not oils at all.  \n\nCertain of those components have effects on our brain. Most notably, the different components effect our amygdala. The center for emotion and fear. The one sense that has the most affect on the amygdala is scent.  Hence the smell of essential oils can have a strong effect on one's emotional state of being. Generally they're positive. \n\nMany many haters will tell you this is nonsense. Anyone who has done any research, or has been emotionally open enough to experience these oils will tell you otherwise. In fairness, it sounds a bit out there, but empirical science backs many if not most of the claims. \n\nPersonally I've found them indispencible in working with a variety of emotions and experiences that have been deeply rooted in my psyche. It's no overnight cure all, but a powerful tool in the arsenal.   \n\nI'd be happy to talk to you more about your specific situation if any of this piques your interest. Best regards, P. ",

How interesting.\" Once one treats the vast majority of his/her random thoughts as random neurons spouting their usual BS, it's easier to not treat them as reflections of the real world that we have to take seriously.\n\nOf course, all that is still theoretical to me.

It may have the affect you want, or it may cause horrible effects. \n\nTry challenging yourself in personal ways to help with self confidence. I've always found that physical exercise helps in the short term for feelings of depression. It's not about how much the other guy next to you can lift or run or push themselves, it's about what your own 100% looks like. I've personally experienced runner's high and I can attest to it. It's hard to start, but in just a couple months you can find yourself looking forward to exercise everyday.",

I try to reach out like after an exam I ask when everyone I know is going out to eat they'll beat around the bush trying to tell me not to. So I just go back to my apartment and just sit there. My life is literally the same cycle everyday I wake up six am eat break feast go to the library study til 8 pm then I see alot of the people I know. I try to chat with them but they really want me to just go away. Like when someone else says a comment everyone laughs and when I say something they just all stare condescendingly so I just go home. Then when I get there I just go to sleep because I have nothing better to do. The only time I actually have an interaction with someone is when they need help for a test or homework and I always help hem because of ow desperate I am for any kind of interaction.  ",

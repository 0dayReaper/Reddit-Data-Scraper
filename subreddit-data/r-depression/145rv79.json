I don\u2019t know if you believe in Heaven and Hell, but my friend when a person dies he either goes to Heaven or Hell. Heaven has been prepared for the Christians that served God. God\u2019s word describes Heaven to be a beautiful place, peaceful and uncontrollable happiness. Hell is for sinners, nonbelievers. It\u2019s a fiery endless dark pit, beast tormenting the ones that are already tormented by the fiery flames. I\u2019m not perfect, but I certainly don\u2019t want to go to Hell! I was taught as a young child, if a person takes his own life he\u2019s a murder. Murder is one of the sins, if not being repented if we take our own life, in my opinion, we\u2019re taking a chance of going to Hell.",

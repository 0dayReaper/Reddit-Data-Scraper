    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nusually when I start to get better after an episode there is something I notice and it's bugging me a lot. \n\nThere are always some thoughts slipping into my mind only for a fraction of a second. Sometimes I can grab them, but most of the time they just vanish as fast as they come. But they always feel like a sting in my guts and they can affect my mood - always in a negative way. It doesn't matter if I recognize them actively or not. As I said they are hard to grab, but when I get them, they are about situations that may be real or not. Something that has happened, something that might happend, something I fear could happen, but also things that never have or will happen. I think they evolve around \"what if\"-scenarios. Maybe it's my anxiety disorder playing into this, too.\n\nI just wonder if anyone else experiences this, too and if there is an actual term for it and if there is a solution to it.\n\nThank you for your replies!",

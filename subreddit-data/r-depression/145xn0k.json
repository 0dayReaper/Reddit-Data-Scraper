    "postText": "So basically i had a choice to choose between doing a German and English test. For some reason my dumbass chose german, even tho I'm alr fluent in English, thinking that I'd be just fine. Lmfao i don't know how it went, i did sole the test itself, but i worry that somehow i might have written something wrong by mistake, making me think that I've chosen the wrong think, aka making me NOT believe in myself anymore since i don't know what's right for me and what's not. I feel awful. And this did not help my mental health at all. And i hate myself because i know this is completely.my fault, knowing that i could've easily chosen the English exam, instead of the German one. Ffs why can't I do anything right",

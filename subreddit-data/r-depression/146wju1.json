            "comment": "Can you look for a flavored toothpaste, like a kids toothpaste? I remember many years ago I once used a bubblegum flavor when I was sleeping at someone\u2019s house.\n\nThere are also different \u201cfirmness\u201d for the toothbrushes. You can get one that has really soft bristles that hopefully won\u2019t hurt your teeth as much.\n\nAlso do you have mouthwash? Even if you can\u2019t brush for whatever reason (let\u2019s say depression), you can much more quickly use mouthwash and at least that\u2019s better than nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for your gums to bleed after you haven\u2019t taken good care of your teeth for a while. Try to be gentle when brushing, especially on the actual gums.\n\nThe truth is you probably need to get those cavities taken care of, but if you know how many you have I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve been to the dentist recently? Are you going back to have anything done for them?\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re lazy. If you\u2019re dealing with mental health stuff it is probably more common than you realize to struggle to take care of yourself (shower, brush teeth, etc).",

Teeth are so so important. Not just for health but for social reasons and professional life. It makes a huge difference and no matter how bad you think they are now, they can always get worse and negatively impact those aspects of life I mentioned. Also, it might help to try using even less toothpaste when brushing. You don\u2019t need a whole lot to get the job done so maybe less in your mouth will help. You got this :)",

            "comment": "You are not lazy. I grew up in the Midwest and my mom stopped taking me to the dentist when I was a kid. We ate bad foods, I wasn't shown how to take care of my teeth properly. I got cavities when I was a teen and my teeth got really bad by the time I turned 24. I lost two od them. The rest are all held together by fillings and crowns but at least I have teeth. It's sucks having bad teeth. It hurt my self image massively. It's expensive but important to see a dentist. The more you go the less it hurts, the less fearful you are of someone drilling on your teeth/ pulling them etc. A job with good benefits helps alot. Better then private insurance imo. If you run out of your deductible you can always get another job and new benefits and just keep going instead of waiting years. It sounds like you have periodontitis. Brush, floss or get a water flosser and use mouthwash multiple times per day. Start getting them fixed. When they are fixed eat healthier and the dental work will last longer. I felt soo bad about myself, I felt soo hopeless when I first consulted with a dentist but now 80% of the work is done I don't feel so bad anymore. All I need left is a filling, two implants and a better made crown and I then I at least have a smile I can maintain and feel confident about again. Teeth are evil but please go see a dentist.",

After years of being anemic and chewing on ice, depression so bad I didn\u2019t brush as I should and then finding out I\u2019m celiac (which I understand harms teeth &amp; gums) I guess there\u2019s plenty of reasons for broken &amp; missing teeth. \nPlease gain the courage you need, even if you fake it, to get your teeth fixed. You will need them every day for the rest of your life.",

            "comment": "Hi\n\nIt may help you to get a toothpaste that is for sensitive teeth so there is less discomfort when you brush teeth maybe with a soft toothbrush and different toothpaste it could make it a bit easier for you.\n\nYour not being lazy it sounds like there could be other things going on if your struggling with depression or other things it can be very hard to be motivated.\n\nYou could ask your mom to make you a dentist appointment with her knowing when it is she can hopefully take you there so it's not adding to your stress or worry.\n\nSeeing your dentist could also help with coming up with something that makes taking care of your teeth easier for you if your autism makes it uncomfortable for you when you clean your teeth the dentist  may have a solution.\n\nJust some things to consider it sounds like your really struggling because of how bad your teeth are when they are fixed the issues your having with brushing could very well be over.\n\nPlease consider talking to your mom about how your feeling and what your dealing with.",

    "postText": "To be honest I\u2019ve wanted to tell my partner my plans for a long time. Since the moment I knew I was completely in love with them. Though the thought of bringing them pain made me sick. It\u2019s been almost a year we\u2019ve been together and I\u2019ve known the whole time what I wanted to do. \nI hurt them so much telling them that I had moved partially to find a peaceful secluded place to pass away. We have gotten so close in the time we\u2019ve had together, and in that time they have shown me so much more to life and joy than I thought possible. \nThey want to fight for me. They want to move me to where they are to show me that we have more adventures. \nI am just so stubborn and stupid. I stick to my word even if it\u2019s bad for me in the long run, which just happens to be one of my biggest downfalls. So when they told me to live for them I couldn\u2019t say I would. \nThe way I see it my life is and always has been a joke. A joke that makes you laugh so hard that you cry, laugh so hard you can\u2019t breathe. So when anything happens to me, good or bad I can just laugh it off as some beautiful spiritual joke. Some divine comedy that was set forth to enjoy and grow. \nThe only problem is now I\u2019m questioning myself. Do I even want to dissolve into the void anymore? Do I really want to disappear? Or do I just not want to feel the crushing weight anymore? \nIf It is only the latter then can I live for someone else? Even if it is for what seems to be the love of my life? The person that fell in love with me when I was doing great, but stayed even when they saw how horribly depressed I really was?\nI\u2019m truly sorry to the person reading my rambling but I\u2019m just so confused now. \nI had these plans for so long now. I\u2019ve pushed so many people away in preparation of what I plan do do. Now I have doubts. Now I might have to plan for something more than my expiration date. \nTo the people questioning, with people who truly love you please help.\nWill I be a burden if I throw away the plan I\u2019ve had for years? If the date of my departure disappears, how can I ever apologize to the people I abandoned? How can I ever let go of the guilt that I feel for willing the people that cared about me to give up on me? \nI know I don\u2019t deserve a second chance to make anything right. How am I supposed to let go of leaving and make up for giving up hope?",

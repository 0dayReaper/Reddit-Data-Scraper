    "postText": "What hope is there for somebody stuck at home with his parents due to his disabilities? I'll tell you, none. I was born an epileptic and it is terrible. Everything was fine until 2018, when I was in the midst of high school. It was at that time my seizures got worse and I began feeling far more distant from the rest of humanity than I ever did before. I began feeling scared to have a seizure in public from then on, because of all the attention it would attract, and my nerves would skyrocket. I just can't remain calm under pressure and all of those eyes would not help. I was not able to attend my own graduation ceremony, because I had one seizure during the practice and once I was alone outside I had a mental breakdown. It's been about 4-5 years and nothing has changed, in fact nothing will ever change. I can never be normal like everybody else; I feel like an alien. I can never get a job or go to college and you may think that's a good thing but think again. How would you feel if all you did your entire life was sit in your room and play video games or watch tv because you wouldn't be able to make it out there? It makes me feel like a prisoner. I can never make any friends. Even those I talked to at school were never really my friends because that's all we did was talk and it was just small talk too. The only friends I actually made all moved away and I was not able to contact them again because they either changed, their parents wouldn't let them, or I was too stupid not to ask for their numbers. I can never fit in with society. I am a failure. I am a disappointment. I have a feeling this is all because of a terrible thing I had done when I was younger. There truly is no hope for me. My dream to be a normal person is impossible and so is any other dream I come up with.  ",

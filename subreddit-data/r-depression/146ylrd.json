    "postText": "Struggling with depression - both clinical and situational - and I've cycled thru depressive episodes for maybe 30 years now. It's not just depression, it's cPTSD and ADHD and several sexual assaults and a list of other letters, and using alcohol to self medicate. I continually find ways to blow up all my relationships; I turn into a complete jerk when I'm struggling and end up driving everyone away. I realize much of this is due to untreated ADHD and misdiagnosis and lack of good health care bc I have trouble holding jobs. The self loathing is becoming overwhelming. I've tried to get help for over 6 months (this time, but I've been on and off meds and in and out of therapy since like 1995). I just wish I could control my super negative attitude that drives people away. Like I get really snarky and lash out at people who don't deserve it. Hurt people hurt people right? All I've ever wanted was to be liked/loved and somewhat content, and all I do is alienate people. Just feeling super low and can't figure out how to finally get all this mental illness under control.",

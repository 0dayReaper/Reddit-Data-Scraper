He\u2019s amazing and it hurts seeing him like this, any time I talk to him how I always have he gets upset because he feels like I\u2019m faking it. \nToday he told me he detaches because his life feels insignificant. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you, and I\u2019m sorry if this is an annoying thing to ask!",

Do something he enjoys because it grabs his attention and doesn't make him focus on what's making him feel the way he does. If he feels insignificant, you should actively engage with his favorite hobby, schedule some cool shit to do, even a walk through a national or state park is always a great way of boosting those feel good hormones. Engage in conversation about a topic he is passionate about. The reason I say this is because sometimes we forget how much we can enjoy life, and how much we mean to others. By showing him you want to be in his life this way, it will show him you value his interests, and you value his presence. Words help, don't get me wrong but it means so much more to experience it and to make it a memory and something to look back on than to hear the same words repeating.",

A lot of it stemmed from trauma, and bullying, but also just feeling different and less developed than my peers. It took a lot of understanding of myself to be able to identify it and try to find healthy ways to treat it but what caused that part was people who cared. It took them some effort to really show me that they didn't want anything  from me other than for me to be my best. But they never broke through to me with words because when you are feeling numb to the world, or feeling like there isn't a point, words can go right over you like they have no weight. I can explain it. When you're feeling this way, your mind is stuck on something in the past and it eats up the value you give yourself. It becomes hard to hold onto words with hope, because you begin to remember where else you heard them. They float away through time and you don't remember it as well as moments, but when you can go out and see the imprint you can actually make into the world, you start to feel more secure about who you are and how others see you.\n\nAs of now, I'm probably my best self but i wouldn't be that way without people showing me that I wasn't a nobody. We are all somebody, we just aren't like anybody.",

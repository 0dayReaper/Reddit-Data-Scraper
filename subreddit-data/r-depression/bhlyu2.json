I couldn't feel ANYTHING. Not depression or the suicidal thoughts, but also not even the glimmers of happiness I could sometimes find before. Once behavioral therapy helped me with some coping mechanisms, I dropped the meds. I didn't feel great still, and I probably was still depressed, but I was able to hold it together for five more years until I actually did start to feel better. \n\nWho knows if I would have continued feeling better if I hadn't gotten pregnant again, but I did. PPD was the trigger for my first bout of depression, and of course I got to be one of the lucky ones to get it again (actually, that's common, but I'm still kicking myself for this). This time...well, actually, I'm not sure I got totally better. Zoloft again, then got off it for about a year, then on again. All over the course of four years. Since I didn't realize Zoloft wasn't doing what it was supposed to do, other than keeping me from being suicidal, I just kept giving it a try and not reporting the issues to my doctor. \n\nI was off meds and feeling better for a couple years when the current episode hit about six months ago, this one with the worst depression and suicidal thoughts I've had so far. I'm back on meds as of almost two months ago, this time thankfully something different because talks with other depressed friends made me realize that Zoloft wasn't doing the right things for me. I'm on Lexapro. Night and day difference. \n\nI'm not saying I'm totally well, and it's not a light switch or anything to just magically make me not depressed, but I am feeling a lot better. I do still have a lot of work to do. There are thought patterns that I fall into easily, a lot of self-hatred and self-blame. I'm working through them, but I probably always will be. I also deal with anxiety, brought on in part by those thoughts as well as social anxiety.\n\nMy biggest piece of advice is to have your doctor monitor you fairly closely and be honest with them. Tell them EVERY side effect or even potential side effect, no matter how small or unimportant you think it might be. Tell them how the meds are making you feel--a lot of times, this just means being honest with how you're feeling and how it's changed (or not) since you started taking them. Honesty is the biggest thing here, honesty with yourself and your doctor.",

My depression/anxiety is terrible, but on here, I still see people that have it better and worse. I learn a lot about me here.\n\nAll the medications I was prescribed had very negative effects on me. Suicidal thoughts (which I have never had outside depression), auditory and visual hallucinations, wildly unpredictable and extreme mood swings, etc.\n\nI stopped them, and began to self medicate. Alcohol or pot. While I admit to being a heavy drinker (this was the majority of the 13ish years), pot was an acceptable substitute for that and allowed me to get free of alcohol. These methods were never approved my doctors, fyi.\n\nRecently, I have done neither, and am taking CBD oil and ashwagandha daily. While I feel personally that does not quite do the trick, I drink only a few beers (3-4) on occasion, and my body is clean of thc.\n\nThe meds terrify me. I refuse to treat myself with them without supervision. I just wonder what would have happened (when I drove 1400 miles with no intention of returning home) if I had not realised it was the meds, and taken one more pill. Would I have killed myself that far from home?\n\nAnd since the doctors know I am not a suicidal risk, they refuse to admit me. I literally begged them to admit me just for mere surveillance, and they tried to bounce me with another script. I flipped out and walked out of the hospital. \n\nShort story, I fought through the depression, and came out alive, and eventually balanced until last year. Trying the same method.",

I struggle picking up directional awareness IE learning roads and stuff. What\u2019s simple for most, feels so complicated for me. The only things I \u201cenjoy\u201d doing, I\u2019m utter shit at, I don\u2019t improve, and it just makes me feel even more awful when I fail constantly.

I\u2019m in the same boat as you, \u201cgifted\u201d into mid-high school and then i guess i became dumber. Really i was just depressed/anxious. What ive deduced it to be is the racing thoughts (anxiety) mixed with the laziness (depression). I think the mixture of these two began to overwhelm me when just doing the most simple tasks. I would be doing something and begin overthinking every move, and i pretty much realized thats what i was spending all my time on. Other times i simply would not want to even try to do anything. The overthinking effectively immobilizes me and i cant do things like homework or even chores. Of course, this in turn came full circle and i started worrying about the actual worrying itself. Vicious cycle.\nNot sure if you can relate to any of what i said about WHY the \u201cdumber\u201d feeling\u2019s there... hope it helps though.",

Just remember that it\u2019s easy to be gifted as a kid, and then you think you\u2019re so gifted that you never have to try again, and you stop trying because the people around you tell child you that you don\u2019t have to try. When you stop trying, you fall behind, and falling behind makes you feel dumb which feeds into your depression and self worth. When you feel dumb you stop believing you can do anything to fix it, and trying to learn feels pointless.\n\nWhen trying to learn feels pointless and you see yourself behind you stop moving forward and watch the world get further from you. You feel more disconnected from the world so you don\u2019t even bother to keep up. You just let the world get more away from you, feel dumber, stop trying, and it all feeds into itself trapping you in a self destructive circle. \u201cI\u2019m not smart anymore, I shouldn\u2019t even bother trying, I\u2019m so dumb, the world got away from me because I\u2019m not smart anymore. Repeat.\u201d\n\nI feel exactly the same way. I was touted as a genius as a kid, and now I\u2019m a sad, stupid, worthless adult who doesn\u2019t deserve to learn anything.\n\nOr, that\u2019s what I tell myself.\n\nI\u2019m now faced with the task of rebuilding my self esteem, abilities, and talent after my mind took it all away from me.\n\nI can though. You can too. Move at your own pace, take it one step at a time. Find something you\u2019re good at and do it. Find something you like and do it. You\u2019re still brilliant, you just got stuck in a self-defeating trap. That\u2019s not your fault, you didn\u2019t cause it, but now you have the opportunity to take responsibility for it and fix it: it won\u2019t happen over night, but it can happen.\n\nI don\u2019t know you, but I believe in you.\n\nGood luck.",

My parents tried to put me in gifted programs, I was honestly just a nuisance tho. Beginning of highschool was alright, thats where my depression started, but freshman year i was still making 100s in everything. Then I switched to an online school, went well for a few months then i started declining. Laziness, stubborness, constantly being tired, just not even caring, all contributed to me starting to fall behind. Now, im moved across the world. I have a few small ambitions, doesnt matter though because 99% of the time i wont accomplish them or even really try. I just get pissed off because i suck at X but wont put in the work to improve it. I hate myself more than anything. I dont even know what im going on about. I just come to this subreddit looking for some fucking miracle that doesnt exist, or something. what am i even doing.",

The brain requires stimulation in order to perform well, which is why it seems that during phases of depression you are thinking, acting slower than usual. \n\nPersonally, I went through 7-8 years of not stimulating myself, due to depression. As i'm recovering, I find myself able to think much more clearly and quickly. I definitely feel a lot smarter.\n\nHang in there, and try and find something that works for you. Recovery isn't easy, but even a small improvement over weeks can have great effects. And remember, if you have a bad day during recovery, that's OK. Focus on what you can do NOW in order to make things a little better for yourself.\n\nBest of luck.\nWe all have faith in you :)",

I fear going into the negative emotions cause that spirals out of control.\n\nI don't eavesdrop, multitask etc or really pay attention to anything besides the single task I would be currently doing at the time.\n\nLots of alcohol (which I haven't drank in over a month now with no withdrawals, and also no positives have come from me stopping) and drugs in general too, to help keep me balanced in my own way.\n\nI don't feel like I've grown dumber but I can easily lose track of stuff in the middle of a sentence, or if I'm interrupted etc. It's not really \"forgetting' completely since I can be reminded and it comes back, it's not like I don't remember it entirely it's just actually drawing it back on my own is a bit weird at times.\n\nI'm pretty much always aloof as well, I barely even talk to anyone including at work. The only person I talk to regularly is my GF and that's easy cause we live together.\n\nTo add to this though, I don't really flex my memory ever cause I don't need to really (not in school or anything) so I might even think that would be more the cause than my depression or anything.\n\nThis may be unrelated but I also have always had horrible spatial awareness so I don't even drive or anything (lil PTSD from a wreck is in there too) I can't remember directions etc, and never really was able to. I've had depression since I was very young like 5~ so it's hard to make a distinction between before/after depression started ruining my life.",

I\u2019m also about to graduate from a graduate school program. With all of this change and stress you would think I got more depressed. But I didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t really explain why, it\u2019s just like I\u2019ve reached a peak in life where I only need myself to make myself happy. But I still exhibit symptoms of depression like sleeping a lot and having difficulty getting my ass out of bed. So not completely out of the woods, but I\u2019ve been feeling better and I\u2019ve been having a better memory too. Things feel less foggy. Anyway there is definite causation between figuring out how to decrease depression and a return of memory function. I can\u2019t tell you what will work for you because everyone\u2019s different, but my suggestion is to find that place, whether it be by medication or therapy or both, and your mental functioning will get better.",

            "comment": "Yes, depression very much affects memory. Chronic stress impairs it.\n\n[source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1977.tb06670.x)\n&gt;It is concluded that endogenous depression clearly impairs memory function as measured by WMS and tests for Retention and that, in accordance with this, recovery from depression eliminates the impairment of memory. \n\n[more](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/depression-can-damage-parts-of-the-brain-research-shows-10391338.html)\n\n&gt;Hippocampal shrinkage was pronounced among those for whom depression started early (before the age of 21), as well as people who had recurrent episodes. Professor Hickie noted that it was this persistence that \u201cdoes the damage\u201d.\n\n&gt;\u201cThose who have only ever had one episode do not have a smaller hippocampus, so it\u2019s not a predisposing factor but a consequence of the illness state.\u201d\n\n&gt;It\u2019s interesting that none of the other subcortical areas of the brain have come up as consistently, so it also confirms that the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to depression.\u201d\n\nThere's a lot more of course. It seems to be reversible once depression is lifted.",

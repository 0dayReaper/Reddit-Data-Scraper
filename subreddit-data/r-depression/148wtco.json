You will get the answers not by consuming but creating within your inner world.\nLearn yourself , learn from past , practice mindfulness , temporarily delete your social media , focus completely on your mind and create your OWN rituals to maintain it.\nIf you are reading this you surely isnt in your best state \nI just wanted to remind you about the truth that you all know but dont realise.",

Maybe your medication has unpleasant side effects, hence being reluctant to take it \n\nCould also be a thing where you're struggling to take on a new habit\n\nSmall changes could make it easier, such as keeping the medication next to your bed with a bottle of water, and setting an alarm to take it in the morning upon waking up",

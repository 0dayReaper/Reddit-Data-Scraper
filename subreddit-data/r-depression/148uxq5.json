    "postText": "It could be a number of reasons I think this way, but at one point I had hope (thought my feelings matter) and now (25) I just realize you make the best decisions you can and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t try to control anyone, I try understanding people (this makes me feel better) but it still leaves me feeling empty that I actually can not help anyone with their problems. (So sometimes I really don\u2019t even want to know). My problems are being worked on, but I don\u2019t have much support (people \u201clove\u201d me but don\u2019t actually care about anything I say). I will call the suicide hotline pretty regularly just because I can\u2019t afford a therapist. A lot of things are likely to get worse for my parents and it\u2019s been horrible for the past decade for them. Off the rails, downright crazy, irresponsible behavior, and no sign anything will improve. I just don\u2019t even challenge them bc they already made their mind up that they will just blame everyone else and not try at all. Sad, considering I know they are smarter, and have achieved success (at least been responsible) before and are absolutely capable now. Just no motivation. I\u2019m staying motivated, but there\u2019s not much to life besides that. Is that common? Is it common for work to just be your livelyhood? Is it not a simulation? A race to mediocrity? Like even if I get 100k salary it\u2019s like still not going to be that great. Probably the best I can make my life. I don\u2019t like myself, I only like people who don\u2019t like themselves bc it shows a healthy awareness. People who don\u2019t doubt themselves are making the world a worse place. We live in a world of Neanderthals double tapping pieces of glass believing they have impacted the world, they give you dating advice like be yourself when myself is a guy who cares but knows caring is too costly. Cowardly? Idk I find virtue signaling as cowardly as it could possibly get. It\u2019s like seeing a guy flexing in the mirror at the gym it\u2019s cringe. We\u2019re not hero\u2019s, we do our part to make billionaire\u2019s richer, and benefit ourselves, and our goals. Most of us live completely selfish lives. It\u2019s a simulation, it\u2019s Sims, and I\u2019m gonna win at sims if it\u2019s the last gosh darn thing I do.",

That was a real moment in my childhood. He then tried choking me up a wall, the teachers stopped it, we saw the counselor together. After he told me to go back over the boarder (I\u2019m Mexican) I told him to stop f\u2019ing his sister (he\u2019s white) the counselor made us shake hands, left us in her office to talk for 5 minutes. The entire 5 minutes we talked about how hot that counselor was. She really was, it\u2019s a moment we will never forget and a memory I hold close to my heart.",

It would benefit you to inoculate yourself to rejection, cause what you described is a strong reaction.

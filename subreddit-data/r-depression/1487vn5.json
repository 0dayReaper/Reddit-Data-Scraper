    "postText": "I am getting tired of it all. I've been trying to get my life on track but every time I do, I go nowhere. I sat down and looked at jobs and every single one that pays decently well I cant do because I'm too idiotic to do them. Looking at getting my GED overwhelms me as I can't retain information in my head for the life of me. I'm getting to the point where I feel like committing suicide is my only way out. My family is shit. My intelligence is shit. And I am cripplingly alone. I don't want to die, but I dont feel like I have a future. I've been slowly trying to build up the nuts to just do it already. I have no value in life and provide nothing. I am not smart. I am not strong and I can't do anything right. Every day is just constant arguing between my parents and having panic attacks all the time. Every time I try to sleep, i hear shit and it spikes my heart rate sky high, be it real or something I thought I heard. All i ever do is be scared but hopefully that'll end. I never asked to be born and I don't know why I was cursed to be.",

If you can look at the worst of times with a happy face, you can do anything. A job is something you can get later, it\u2019s not about how much it pays, it could be minimum wage, if you look at minimum wage job and go \u201cshit happens\u201d with a grin, you can do just about anything. It\u2019s your outlook on life and your will to actively improve it that matters",

The government and 1% go out of their way to crush us under their heel, and would rather us be depressed so that we don't fight back. They've robbed us of our potential.\n\nIt's up to us to say \"FUCK YOU. I MATTER.\", as we remain steadfast in pursuit of contentment. The spikes of depression may plunge deeper into our soul in spite of our efforts, but so long as we stick to our principles, victory is inevitable.",

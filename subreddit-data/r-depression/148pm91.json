    "postText": "I wasn't invisible for the longest time, I had loads of friends and multiple people talked to me and everything was fine, but quarantine hit and I suppose as I mentioned before, I became invisible. I get that people tell you to put yourself out there and talk to others, but its scary out there. people only become more toxic and toxic these days and there is no one left to really to be friends with it. I just feel like everyone did the act like they never met me for the past 3 years, it really does hurt when even teachers don't notice you. It took me a long time to love myself back in 2021 but it took less than a week to hate myself once again. I know this isn't really talking about the invisibility, but its the things that come with it that makes it worse",

    "postText": "I swear I really tried. I really believed it. I'd been going to the gym regularly for 3 months and I wasn't giving up. I was losing weight, gaining muscle. I didn't give a damn about anything. Nothing mattered anymore. I'd met a girl I felt something for, and she felt something for me too. I REALLY thought it was good, that I'd managed to start conquering these demons that were circling around my mind. I'd even stopped tiktok and all my addictions, I was starting to see things more clearly, I was even working on my dream book (I dream of being a novelist). \n\nThen, all of a sudden, everything fell apart. The girl I had a thing for left. I said to myself, \"Oh, it doesn't matter, life goes on.\" Then I started going to the gym less and less. I started eating junk food again. I started watching tiktok on a loop again, I started going to bed at 2am again. I feel that deep empty feeling in my chest again. It's there again, that feeling of wanting to give up everything, that nothing is worth it anymore and that I've done all this for nothing.",

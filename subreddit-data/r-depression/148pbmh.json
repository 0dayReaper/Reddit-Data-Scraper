    "postText": "I\u2019m 28 now but since I was a little girl, I\u2019ve had depression. I\u2019m so tired of having depression, the panic attacks, and anxiety. I wish that I had a normal childhood. I wish I never had to deal with any of this. I wish I never had to live with any of this.\n\nI\u2019m on medication and have been and doing all the things but I still get into ruts. It\u2019s impossible to completely avoid.\n\nSometimes I don\u2019t want to live. I just don\u2019t. I see cars pass by and wish one would hit me and just end it quickly. But then I remember that I have a sweet dog and that some people in my life would be very hurt. It sucks.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever have a normal life. I think I\u2019ll have to live with this for as long as I know. Currently just sitting in bed thinking about how much this sucks. That\u2019s all",

            "comment": "Hey, I'm 26 and I understand how you feel. I grew up on the west coast in america in a fairly quiet home as an only child. I'm convinced that the silence I experienced growing up as an only child contributed to my depression. As far as I remember into my childhood, I can always recall feeling how I was in less than optimal mood. All I really did was cultivate a habit of playing fun video games to distract myself. This spread into high school, where the expectations of academic performance and excellence felt unachievable. My parents didn't help me build social skills very much so I always felt socially awkward and below my peers. I'm lucky to have a supportive group of friends now who check in and talk with me about deep topics related to anxiety and depression, but I still can't shake the feeling that this is an internal battle I have to deal with by myself forever. I also feel really bad for burdening them with negative vibes.\n\nI don't know what to say to help besides I know how you feel. I'm holding on, but if I didn't have a great support network, I'd probably be dead by now. Let me know if you want to talk with someone who gets it. I have time today.",

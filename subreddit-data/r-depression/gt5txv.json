But I go through manic mood swings, and while on the depressive end I feel like absolute shit, when I'm out of that phase and feel somewhat \"normal\" again I tell myself I greatly exaggerated the effect in my mind. It doesn't help that my self loathing won't let me admit that I have depression because I keep thinking I don't deserve to be depressed. So I invalidate myself and continue life until the next phase hits, and the cycle continues.",

Startet treatment and kind of got over it and immediately I can barely relate to the suicidal person a few weeks ago and think I just dramatized everything and I don't need treatment anymore. Luckily I told enough persons in my life now that I can't simply ignore it and go back to my old ways.",

She invalidated me, insinuated that I'm blaming our parents by seeking help and that I'm using this as an excuse to procrastinate during exams. It was very hurtful.\n\n I have said much much meaner things to myself all my life to run away from the prospect of seeking help but I worked through them and I only want to solve the problems I have. Now I don't like blaming anyone for it but myself. But seeing someone else say that to me made all those feelings ricochet back to me with great force and I think it'll make me question everything all over again.",

Worse, what If I actually am, just pretending to feel special... \n\nI made this fucking alt account just l to write this. I spent the last two hours looking for a reason not to go see a doctor tomorrow, as I planned for a few days now. I took so many online depression tests and everytime I see the result or try to select an honset answer, I feel like I must be lying, pretending to justify why I can't get anything done...\n\nI am struggling just hitting sent on this. What an attention seeking move this would be. Am I even honest to me? I hate this.",

It happened a little under two years ago but now I don\u2019t open up to my friends. The closest I get is sending sad tiktoks, saying that the algorithm is too specific, and wondering if they\u2019ll notice.",

I have quite a few friends who have had much worse home lives than I so I always told myself that I was selfish for being depressed.\n\nThose damn chemicals.",

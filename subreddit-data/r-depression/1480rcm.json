    "postText": "We have a new girl as an employee where i work. She's cute... And for the past 2 days didn't had the chance to say anything to her in regards to ask for a date... Today saw her with someone already and she left with guy and a bunch of others... To the point... The thing is, while i wait for the opportunity to arise, my heart goes ahead of my reason and starts building the courage others already have, starts building the hope and attaches to the expectation of finally getting the chance... I am left disappointed in myself and depressed alike each and every time. Sometimes i find out they have boyfriends, sometimes are married. None are single... 20 years passed and nothing... I keep playing a game of waiting like I used to do in chess and using the turtle style: \"Defensive mode all the way until the path is clear for a lightning strike move.\" I'm tired of this game. I crave for affection and human touch... Perhaps, i need a suffering soul in my life so we can heal each other...",

            "comment": "First off, if you're desperate - you'll get nothing. Secondly, \"build it - and they will come\"...\n\nYou lack courage, get that courage otherwise. Lack confidence - get it otherwise.\n\nWomen can smell stuff like that, and you'll begin to notice when they get an interest in you.\n\nBe really careful though... Not every one is for your own good... So weed them out carefully.\n\nSome will treat you badly when you weed them out, and then you'll feel sad that you have lost your only chance, and you're right back where you started. No... There is a good reason for you weeding them out. Do not be desperate, be right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sure you're destined for something greater than just a girlfriend to cover your wounds.\n\nBe more masculine, but not by listening to the toxic red pill gang. \n\n*I can't do this... Sure you can.* \n\n*I'll wait... You shouldn't.* \n\n*I'll do this after I have... No.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink about your values, and how you act on them or sacrifice them. \n\nStop doing stuff that makes you feel bad about yourself, including people pleasing. But don't become a douche about it... Just realize why you *should* do something, and why you *want* to do something... \n\nA woman smiling at you is not a good reason to be kind, just because you feel lonely inside.\n\nOf course if you're kind, you would like to be appreciated somewhat, at the very least respected. So if someone is overtly flirty to you just so that you do something for them, stare at them coldly. It's disrespectful. If you see them get ashamed - then you help them. You teach people how to treat you...\n\nA character is better than a purpose, a purpose is better than an image, an image is better than nothing. So try to work on the virtues and strengths of your character, and not your vices or short comings. Then think of how you can contribute.\n\nSelf-worth, self-respect, self-esteem. \n\nYou do not have to be perfect, but you need to feel that you are on the right path in life, and then some wonderful girl will pop up.",

            "comment": "Edit: excellent point given above.  Take the time to ACTUALLY READ your employee handbook or website.  Most companies have adopted psychotic policies.  \n\nIf a woman even ACCUSES you of anything, you are AUTOMATICALLY guilty.\n\nLiterally don't even look at, smile or talk with women at work if you can avoid it. Be like a robot, super calm, super neutral.\n\nHaving a girlfriend or a wife of any type can end up being a curse.\n\nThe odds are stacked against you, and likely there is little or nothing you can do about that, except, as you mention, lower your sights.  This means you will likely end up with someone who has also lowered her standards in accepting you, and the two of you will just end up resenting each other.\n\nDivide up your needs.  Get your affection supply from a platonic relationship. A lonely person in the nursing home will reflect back genuine affection for your kindness.  A dog or cat will give you unconditional love.  Think outside the box.\n\nSex? Hire an escort.  Physically attractive women almost always come with a lot of drawbacks, and in the end, they are simply not worth the cost.  When you pay cash it may be emotionally cold, but you come out way ahead in the long run.\n\nOdds are astronomical against you getting what you want, but you can choose to invest your alone time improving yourself instead of moping.   Exercise, study, skills.  Learn to tell jokes, how to dance, speak another language.   When you can speak another language, you just doubled the number of females you will be able to communicate with.  What would it take for you to move up to a better job, more money?  Like it or not, women want to be parasites and you will attract more if you make more money.",

Love is disgusting, it may look good in pictures, movies, but a lot of these people aren\u2019t good to their core. So care more about who you are to your core. Take your self esteem from not what you don\u2019t have but do have. A selfish life is not worth it.",

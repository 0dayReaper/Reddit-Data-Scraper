    "postText": "The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. \n\nI think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.\n\nI can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. \n\nI'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. \n\nIt has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay \"depression stupid\" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions.\n\nEDIT: This blew up over night, I'm thankful for the lively discussion in the comments, thanks for the awards. May you all find a way to get rid of this. Lots of love.",

Also feels like I'm behind most people my age, that's a shitty feeling :/ although I'd say most people are doing less than you think they are. And that's okay because there's no rulebook on how to live and there's not anything wrong with not living a flashy, super ambitious life. I have a hard time feeling intelligent these days because of how little depression allows me to do and how hard it makes it for me to think clearly, but from what I understand many highly intelligent people are much more prone to depression. It sounds to me like that's what's going on in your case. I guess it's the curse of having an active and sensitive mind. Seems like some of the most unique brains just aren't built to process the world the same way as the average person's, and that can cause some mental malfunctioning",

Changing your mind and processing are strenuous exercises, chess grandmasters burn an athlete's share of calories just sitting in a chair.\n\n&gt;If you focus on the biological damage caused by the depression, it will only make you more depressed and cause more damage. But if you believe that you can heal, there's a good chance that you will or it will at least keep it from getting worse. \n\nI'd say, not so much good chance as best chance. There was a principle I picked up while working as a salesman for a life insurance company. I'd take over a hundred calls a day and was expected to keep a 2% conversion rate, which meant a lot of rejection. As you can imagine, it was hard to jump on to every call with the attitude that the person was going to take a policy, or even listen to me. However illogically, though, I had to retain that attitude over every call, as the 2% of people wouldn't listen to me if I didn't, and I never knew when they were going to pop up.\n\nIn transposing this to depression, I've come to remind myself that the best (and only) chances I can give myself are in going about things as if I can expect some improvement, however unlikely I think it is.\n\nThanks for your thoughts. I'm not OP but I appreciate them too :)",

That's pretty much my experience with antidepressants. For the first 6-12 months they really helped, but stopped having any sort of benefit beyond that. Ten years later (with multiple attempts to wean off but running into withdrawal symptoms) they do nothing but make me emotionally numb. I still don't get the wild mood fluctuations I used to, but with no more lows also comes no more highs, so I'm just flat all the time. Still depressed and anxious, but now it's very monotone. I feel I'd need alcohol or drugs to get my brain to feel some sort of normal again, even just for a brief moment.",

            "comment": "There exist some evidence in the scientific literature for cognitive impairment when depressed. However to my knowledge the effects tend to be reversable.\n\nAlso, from what I have witnessed most depressed people rather have a motivation impairment than a cognitive one. This means that this book sentence you cannot keep in mind, might just be because your overall motivation and mood are pretty low. This prevents your mind from functioning adequately but it does not mean you are becoming less smart (age might so that buy often experience make up for it).\n\nTo test for that, if you still have hobbies/passion you can genuinely enjoy (I know it can be hard) try to see whether you can be effective in those. Often people realize that can perform quite well while doing some board games or solving puzzles in a fun setting.\n\nAlso think about the fact that your depressed mood has an evolutionary function which is precisely to demotivate you because your mind does not believe you are in the right place or doing the right thing. Maybe you are working too hard or the work is too difficult and you need to downgrade for your own well-being.\n\nMaybe you are depressed not because of your job but rather something else. But in anycase consider that the cogntive problem you are encountering might rather just be a motivational one.  Your motivation might be so low that your mind is preventing you from making the intellectual efforts. Which means that you are not getting less intelligent strictly speaking even if functionally it might feel so (and I know it feels dreadful).",

Most of us do not like doing something but sharing something/some activity with other people. It is sometimes tough to find the right people to share woth but I believe few things are enjoyable purely on their own (or they are because we feel connected to others elsewhere in our lives).\n\nI played a lot to games like WoW and War 3 and SCII when I was younger and playing later on by my own felt very unrewarding and meaningless. But with good friends to share it with, the meaningfulness came back. I found that the difference between feeling like a recluse and being connected can just be about sharing your passion and activity with someone you feel connected with.\n\nOnce a sense of purpose or connectedness returns, recovery can go really fast.\n\nAnyway, hope you will get over the storm, there are no easy solutions for those problem, but I think you can have reasonable hope. I wish you the best :)",

Depression seems to have a lot to do with the area that usually handles empathy, but also dampens other more cognitive processes. \n\nThis would explain the feeling that one becomes dumber, and also the tendency to isolate, without saying anything about the effects video games can have on intelligence and empathy.\n\n&gt;eventually it does come back after a while of training my brain again\n\nThis, I completely agree with, but I believe video games may be a way to regularly train your cognitive processing, and they usually factor in an element of empathy for you to work on as well. Whether it's wanting civilians to survive in a shooter, building a prosperous town in a sandbox or crying when a side character dies in an RTS, many games give us the opportunity for empathy and the motivation to think our way to a better position.",

I also played sports year round so I think 3.4 is pretty good for having a tendency to focus more on sports than academics. \n\nSecond year at community college my depression really kicked in strong. I started to skip classes and ended up failing some. I took 12 credits and passed them all the following spring to raise my GPA enough to transfer to a local university when I was 21. From there I went on a streak of registering for 15 or 12 credits but only getting 12 or 9 credits. Dropped out when I was 23 after 6 semesters and a combined 96 total credits from community college and university. \n\nToday I just registered for 12 credits at the local community college! I\u2019m now 25 and after two years away from taking classes I think I\u2019m ready to go back again with a better mindset. I believe we both have the power to fight our depression.

            "comment": "Hello Eggplantspecialist.\n\nAs a depressed fellow, I know 100% what you mean. And sadly, it is true. Depression leads to some state of acute dementia. Long periods of heavy depression can do a lot of damage to your intelectual integrity.\n\nBut, set your mind at ease. This condition reverts once you get rid of depression. Don't get me wrong, getting rid of depression is hard enough and honestly, seek professional help. If you can't get locally, try video appointments. Think of depression as stormy clouds hiding the blue sky. Once you get rid of the storms, the beautiful parts of your brain will blossom. Some things you can do ASAP to improve your condition:\n\n- Get your diet straight. Nutrition plays a major role in mental health. Avoid addiction and over-indulgence food like processed, fast food, sugar-added foods. Sugar alone can mess your brain up pretty hard. So be cautious. Try some fasting, try high protein and omega 3 rich foods. This should help you feel better.\n\n- Practice any kind of physical activity. Seriously, whatever you like to do, just break a sweat and test your body limits a little. Sedentarism messes up your neurotransmitters and is a major risk factor for developing depression. Also, you won't get out of a depression very easily without exercise.\n\n- Try not to dwell on negative thoughts, it is a slippery slope. Actively change your focus whenever possible. Think of it as POISON to your brain and do what you can to keep it's levels low.\n\n- Forgive yourself. Today I had a day full of negative thoughts, high neuroticism and abysmal self-esteem. It won't keep me from trying to improve tomorrow.\n\n- Coffee helps, sometimes. And I also used Ritalin with some good results. But don't get an addiction on it to be functional. Use any stimulating drugs with caution. Don't become a drug-addict, it will only hide your pain but do nothing for the problem.\n\n- Relax a little! If you have high IQ, you didn't lose it. Once you get your depression under control, you will feel your brain function improving. You're gonna make it. Hang tight, be strong.",

Easy to say but the remedy is: exiting the depressed state and running or swimming (or anything aerobic).

That put me in a pretty fucking deep spiral from June of last year to about a month ago. Still working through things but overall, a month of therapy in May and taking the time I needed to disconnect, I\u2019m a whole new man. \n\nPoint is, I know EXACTLY what that feels like. Jokes I used to get and throw back went right over my head. It took a several times for someone to repeat directions before I comprehended them. Reading a textbook and sitting in lectures felt like I didn\u2019t belong, because I had no idea what they were saying. It all compounds and buries you in the weight of it all. I felt like I\u2019d lost about sixty points of IQ. I\u2019m pretty confident to say that I\u2019m one brilliant motherfucker but damn if my depression didn\u2019t make me dumb as shit. Problem-solving, overthinking, obsessive thoughts, processing information; you name it, I was struggling, dude. \n\nBut just know that like depression, it\u2019s temporary. Who knows how long it will take before we reach the other side, but it will come to pass one day, gradually getting better until the weight is gone. It\u2019s slow, agonizing, and not without lots of tears and pain, but it will come to pass. Who knows, maybe it\u2019s been so long I\u2019m overdue for another spiral, but nothing is in my life that can set me off again. \n\nStay strong, and never stop believing in yourself.

It\u2019s all a blur. I keep asking myself, what\u2019s wrong with me? What has made me so broken\u2026 But it was always the same answer: I did this. I ruined my own life and all I could do was regret what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m not even trying to be happy at this point, I just want to end it all.",

    "postText": "Everytime I try to do anything, may it be lauching a game, I stay on the game like 10 seconds then leave, then I try picking up a pencil to work on my art, I look at references for about 15 seconds and then giveup, same for netflix, same for reading, same for any other videogame (sometimes I try with 5 different ones and no, I just give up straight away), same for youtube or twitch. Let's not even talk about my life responsibilities and taking care of myself, I just feel awfully frustrated at any little misstep and give up. My tolerance levels are so down I feel frustrated by anything. It's so weird, it is like I do not feel this natural 'contentment' of the moment, I feel like my mind just can't tolerate doing anything. I could be looking at a wall but then I'd start feeling super depressed.  This is just crazy. DOesn anybody relate? ",

I get annoyed at everything and can\u2019t seem to shake it.  I know that interacting with people gives me energy/lightens my mood but I don\u2019t have any friends only work friends.",

    "postText": "im so annoyed that I have to wake up everyday. all i want to do is rot in bed and never get back up again. i literally work in mental helath and have to keep a happy face at work and that's fine that's what i want to do. i am going to work, doing fitness classes, and starting school again, but i dont want to do any of it. i want to fall off the face of the earth. i am trying to do the self talk and reframe my thoguhts, but it is so tiring trying to be okay all the time. i want to be able to wake up and not hate myself. i know it takes a lot of work, but i dont want to feel like every day is a drag. i dont want to have to acitvely think to be okay, i wish my default was not dread. i wake up and dread every day and i have this constant feeling of impending doom in my chest. i always feel like something bad is going to happen and i cant push it away. i can distract myself from the feeling sometimes, but it always comes back up. just seeing the sunset or time go by gives me so much anxiety. i cant stand it. i dont want to feel this way, its been too long like this. i am in therapy, i have been in therapy for a good minute, but gosh damn living is just so tiring.\u00a0i am trying to fill my time up so i dont have time to still and think of how sad i am.",

Find a different job and continue to help others if that's your passion. Take some time off. See if there's somewhere else you'd rather live. Don't let yourself get trapped in your own life. Take a risk on yourself. The safe road doesn't make it the best choice.",

I think I\u2019ve become efficient in masking it all though. I don\u2019t feel like i have anybody in my life to share the despair with. And so, I bottle it. I haven\u2019t tried therapy yet, but would like to. I\u2019m just so awkward and the thought of it makes me anxious",

I hate everything about myself and I am at that age that I don\u2019t feel like I can go back a little bit and clean up the mess I have created. The only thing that\u2019s left is to observe. Observe my miserable life. Not getting off the bed, absolutely no hygiene or self respect, my appetite is down. At least I am stress free. The majority of the time. Sometimes my dreams are making me remember some embarrassing moments which are kind of unpleasant. But the nightmares don\u2019t scare me. What scares me is that I am wasting my life cs i am a bit of a pssy to end it yet. Idk how to tell my parents that I don\u2019t want to study anything I just want to sleep. Don\u2019t even bother to go on my phone anymore, it\u2019s dry as the Sahara desert and tiktok is rotting my brain even more. If it\u2019snot already completely rotten",

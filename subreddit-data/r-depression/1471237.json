    "postText": "Hi, now I been anxious about something little, recently my classmate decided to have an outing but we need to go individually in the resort that we made a reservation, then I'm not really close with my classmate but I only know one person , then this close friend of mine wants me to go together in the resort along with his gf, so I overthinking that I might became a third wheel on their trip or I might feel awkward since I'm not very close to his gf .... But one of my classmate suggested to come with them, so now the problem I don't know who I might go with because my close friend might think I'm mad, or something if I go with my other classmate .. \n\n\nSorry for my poor grammar",

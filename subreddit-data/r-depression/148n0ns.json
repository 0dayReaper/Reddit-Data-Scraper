I've been calling the prevention lines and all the referrals they give me and it just goes nowhere, nothing is available or they just want to take my money. Last time I went to the hospital for depression they told me to take Benadryl and sent me home. I don't think I'll ever get any real help. It's hopeless and I'm just tired of hurting. I just want it to end.",

I'm not sure why they don't offer more help or refer to more helpful resources or not be disrespectful/irritating...also some staff are assigned to help but seemingly forget about my case. I've found more helpful information on the internet than the IRL stuff.",

No one will ever care about me. There is no one. I have nowhere to turn but a job that I hate and a house i can't afford. \n\nI've tried reaching out for help, there is none. No one cares. They just want to post on Facebook that if anyone is suicidal, message them, all lies. \n\nThis is the worst I've ever been. I'm tired.  I don't want to be here.  This world is full of horrible people and darkness.  I tried killing myself a few months ago, I failed, everyone just thought I was sick. \n\nThere's no choice but to try again\n\nI tried\n\nI tried as hard as I could for many years. \n\nI had hope, I tasted happiness... Then it is all taken from me.",

I haven\u2019t been quite that far down that road but I\u2019ve been on that road. \n\nLet me propose a question, you have a relationship that sounds over, and a house you can\u2019t afford. These are both things that you can change. Instead of ending life, why not say you have nothing to lose so you can do anything? Sell the house, buy a cheap rv or mobile home, live simply. Find a job that you like. Heck, save some money and move to South America. Idk man, just try to do something",

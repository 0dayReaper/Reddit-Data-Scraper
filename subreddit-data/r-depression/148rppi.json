    "postText": "To start off, my mother has severe depression and is bipolar, and I knew things like this is a possibility but it's just, surprising. She's always being so unreasonable and rude, and I only have one other family member left who is just rude and annoys me for his entertainment. Most of my days, especially this summer where there's no school, I'm stuck home with no one else I could talk to or go out with and stuck here arguing and stressing everyday with the person who annoys me for his entertainment. Thankfully, I was allowed to go out and enjoy a few days with more of a motherly figure, and my dad has passed (but there is also a father figure). Every chance I get to be with them, I become really happy and energetic. The past few days I've been with them have been awesome, I was camping with them, talking, playing, and just having great moments with them. I had to come to the realization that I had to come home today (I already did) and I wasn't happy about that. My mom for some reason doesn't like them, and her reasonings are, in my opinion, stupid. She thinks that they're trying to do better than her, and that's not their goal, they just want me happy and they just love me for who I am. My mom gets mad when I get something that is beneficial to me, she was mad because they spend quality time with me, bought me shoes, bought me, clothes, bought me conditioner and shampoo and, bought me real healthy dog food for our dog. My mom thinks they're trying to control what happens in our house. Every time I have an awesome time with them, she gets mad, which is weird because everytime I asked to do something with her, she said no. The shoes, she's trying to prove to me that she spent more money on my shoes and that the shoes they bought me are useless. The clothes, she said I had enough and that they were cheap, and looked bad on me but I disagree. The shampoo and conditioner, she didn't like that they bought me a specific brand. For context, our dog eats only meat, which is, beef, ham, chicken, and turkey. They knew that and wanted to help out by buying actual dog food, and I was happy and excited about it. I wanted my dog to be healthier, happier, more energetic, and playful. I can't say how happy my dog is, but she isn't energetic and playful at all, and that's not normal, she's only three years old and has been like this for two years. The disbelief I had when I showed my mom the dog food was unbelievable, she got pissed, she started saying that they shouldn't control what our dog eats, and the dog should only eat what we eat, and she told me to throw the dog food away. I don't know if I even want the dog anymore, I feel like she's suffering. They didn't buy me all this stuff today, it was over the course of two years but they bought me dog food yesterday, and lots of clothes recently and the only reason I can think of why she's pissed is because she's jealous of them. They are so much more like parents than my mom. They help my mental health a lot just by being with them, I love them and my mom says I can't go with them anymore (She said that many times over the course of two years). Those are the only people I love too, so it sucks. I'm now going to be here at my house everyday angry, lonely, and stressed until hopefully next month, which they said they'll take me camping again. I don't know if my mom will let me go.",

            "comment": "I know EXACTLY how you feel. And the reason why your mom is angry all the time, she's being rude and unreasonable and doesn't let you go with the people that you love and feel comfortable with is because you might come to the realization that she's too afraid to admit, that she's is a bad parent. She may be suffering or have a bipolar disorder, but that is not your problem. \n\nThe only thing you can do is fight for yourself no matter how hard that is. I assume you are a teenager so fighting now will be really hard, because in a way you can still be \"controled\". But as you get older, life will be easier. Try to be as close as you can to the people that are your mother and father figures and maybe even talk to them about this, but don't let them get involved because it will get much more messy.\n\nThe first chance that you get to get out of that house, take it.\nTrust me, a fight with a person like your mother is not something you can win. Because even if you do fight or just try to have an adult conversation about how you feel, what bothers you etc she'll escalate it and then try to manipulate you into thinking that somehow you are the bad person or the black sheep in the family. \n\nI know this is probably something you didn't want to hear, because after all she is your parent, but I'm very familiar with the type of person your mother is so I know what I'm talking about. \nI hope this helps you.",

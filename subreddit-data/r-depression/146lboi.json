    "postText": "For the last several years I've been feeling this way. Since year 8 to be exact, I'm now in year 12. I haven't told anyone, friends, parents or DRs. It's got to the point where feeling down is really starting to impact my life and everything I do. \n\nMy mood swings are dramatic, from feeling fine, full of energy and genuinely happy and suddenly 10 minutes later I'll be feeling totally helpless and like there's no way out. These episodes can last anywhere between 30 minutes to a week. During this time my appetite takes a total crash and I feel sick to eat just about anything, I withdraw from my family and frequently express hate towards them which feels so real but it's gone when I bounce back (meaning its not real and in my head, but how can I randomly express extreme hatred that goes away as soon as it comes?). What causes these episodes is still unclear to me despite the amount of times they occur (everyday for the past 8 weeks at least). sometimes it just comes out of nowhere, sometimes its started when someone (usually a family member, teacher) makes a mild criticism or remark. I totally lose it and it ruins my day, I can't not think about it, alot of the time I don't even know why I'm upset or mad.\nMy school attendance over the past 4 weeks has gradually become so shit and my grades are in hot pursuit. I'm a high achiever and always tried in school, I got exams in 2 days and have not studied very hard despite knowing that I'm likely fucked and could very well throw away most of what I've worked hard for, but I just don't care even though I always valued my schooling. \n\nI'm extremely lazy and lethargic, I have insomnia and bad dreams every night which are very vivid including common occurrences of sleep paralysis, I eventually went to the doctor regarding my sleep after I acted out in a dream and split my head open after running across my room in my sleep and stumbling face first into my desk. I was perscribed medication which helped but after my prescription ran out the sleep problems returned and still remain.\n\nI've lost interest in everything and have zero hobbies anymore which makes life boring as fuck. I used to do gymnastics and weight lifting for many years but haven't been at all in the past 8 months and everytime I plan on going I fall through. I try to play video games with my friends like we used to and I have no interest in it anymore. Games I used to enjoy suddenly seem not entertaining/stimulating at all. I've withdrawn from alot of friends suddenly and violently, some who felt like family to me and I could tell anything I don't talk to at all now which hurts alot because I can't fix it, and I caused it. everything feels like my own fault. I constantly feel like im ruining my day from the second I wake up and I cant help but not fixate on it for the whole entire day which kills any productivity I or anyone else was hoping for or expecting.\n\nI'm not meeting peoples expectations anymore and recently feel like I need to move away as soon as I can and just restart my life in another country. I don't feel like I can live in my house for another day sometimes. people ask if everything is OK, my dad asked me just the other day but I can't open up despite my best efforts. it's uncomfortable and telling people \"im fine\" has always been the best way to ease that sudden uncomfort.\n\nIt's safe to say that wherever I'm at now, is my lowest. Despite this, I'm still waiting for life to get better but im losing hope bit by bit, day by day. I'm not comfortable talking to anyone about it including doctors and I've already decided long ago that I will never bring my friends or family into this. I'm only comfortable opening up anonymously at this point in time. I'm looking for advice, things I can do to mitigate my problems before reaching out to a Dr.\n\nThe only other useful information I can share is that I do have ADHD and I'm un medicated atm (the medication makes it more shitty). I also smoke weed to cope when I can which always helps me out of the depressive episodes by realising I'm freaking out over nothing, weed brings out the likeable person in me. however im positive these are not withdrawals from weed as I've taken month(s) long breaks so please don't advise the weed is what's causing it.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm basically creating this post to get some things from my mind to a place where maybe someone will understand/validate the way that I am feeling. I am a 25 y.o male and have been obsessing about something out of my control for quite some time. It is my college degree and I almost wish that I didnt have it. I can feel a weight associated with it in my mind. And the reason it bothers me so much is because it reflects my dads inability to hear me. Ever since I was in highschool I knew that something was off with him and through the years I have felt that he may be narcissistic. I just saw him last night and when he is speaking he has a very strong need to be listened to and really does not care about listening to me. He does not or is not able to realize that I am my own person and thinks that I am just going to go along with whatever he says. He has an \"expert\" opinion on everything and generally believes that most people are not as smart as him. When in fact, he is actually very unintelligent in many ways. We were talking about the recent bad air quality that has swept down the east coast. For some reason it made me think of nuclear bomb droppings and I brought up the fact that the United States dropped nuclear bombs onto Japan in the 40s. My Dad then tried to tell me that those were not nuclear but hydrogen bombs and that nuclear bombs are much bigger than hydrogen bombs, both which are untrue statements. The way that he acts is like I know nothing and he knows everything as he is almost blindly certain that he is correct about everything, and I know nothing. It's a very ego based behavior and I am sure some of you are familiar with this sort of behavior. Anyway, I have felt very stuck for a long time now because I feel like in pursuing my bachelor's degree, I never really sought out to do something that I wanted to do. He influenced me to attend two universities that I never wanted to, one being a community college. And when I think about those degrees they almost don't even feel like mine. It's such a hard thing to get over because I have these degrees, but since my dad has never truly listened to me it feels like I just got them without really feelikg like I was autonomously pursuing something I wanted. I almost want to go back to a different school now and start over, maybe study biology or something, but my mind gets so fixated on that bachelor's degree and I feel like I am losing my mind. I'll always have them and it will be a reflection of my dads inability to hear me. How can I start over and feel like I have a blank slate? Do I need to go back to school to do this? I just want to be my best self and be the person I know I am capable of being. I do not have a support system and dont feel like I can turn to family. I am upset that all of these years go by and I still feel like an 18 year old kid that wants to do something great, but now I am 25. Somone please write back,\n\nG",

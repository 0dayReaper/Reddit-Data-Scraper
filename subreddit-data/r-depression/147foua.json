Please do hold on \u2764\ufe0f Get out there and get help. Whether that\u2019s talking to someone, starting something new (job, hobby,..), getting a therapist whichever it is. I don\u2019t know you so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s best here but anything of this sort is good. This might be such a hard step and difficult but you can do it and I am rooting for you always \u2764\ufe0f Sending you love \u2764\ufe0f",

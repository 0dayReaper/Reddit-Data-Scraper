    "postText": "Trigger warning: mention of a suicide attempt\r  \n\r  \nI'm a 23-year-old guy. I feel like the past two years have been a constant struggle. I've grown a lot as a person and changed, but I'm tired. I've gotten to the point that emotional stability seems unreachable, and I've stopped expecting anything to end well. People tell me I'm in a transition period in my life, but it seems like I'm not actually getting anywhere.\r  \n\r  \nIt started pretty much when covid started. I was in my second year of college. Online classes destroyed my motivation for school because that's basically what I had done for 12 years as a homeschooler, and I didn't want that experience again.\r  \n\r  \nShortly after I turned 21, I started having major struggles accepting myself as a gay man. I was a conservative Christian at the time, and I was miserable with myself. This led to me rethinking all my religious views, and within a few months I was an atheist. That change in worldview gave me an existential crisis. On one hand, I was happy that I no longer felt bad about my sexuality, but for quite awhile everything seemed bleak, depressing, and pointless. I felt overwhelmed with the concept of death. Eventually I came out of the closet. Some people were upset at me for being gay, and their reactions upset me.\r  \n\r  \nBy then I had transferred to a big university, my dream school. But I felt very isolated and didn't relate to the overall student culture. I felt like everyone around me was doing more than me. I made friends that I really like and respect, but trying to hang out with them was always a struggle. I tried dating but as of today still haven't even gotten close to a relationship.\r  \n\r  \nI'm tired of dealing with toxic people. Whether it's a housemate, a coworker, a boss, or guys I dated, it just seems like I can't have a break from awful people.\r  \n\r  \nIn October I had some emotional breakdowns. Many times I went to bridges and contemplated jumping off. Eventually my best friend got involved and ended up calling the police to do a wellness check on me.\r  \n\r  \nBack in December, I graduated. It felt so good to be done with school. I actually prefer working to school as long as the work environment isn't toxic. However, I started getting depressed again as the job searching wore on me.\r  \n\r  \nA bunch of things started weighing down on me, and in February I made a suicide attempt which resulted in me going to the ER. I ended up being perfectly fine since my attempt was pretty half-assed. Also around that time I told my best friend I needed to take a break from interacting with him since I was getting to be a pretty toxic friend. I stopped talking to him for about three months.\r  \n\r  \nIn April I finally got a job and was so relieved. I was also happy because they offered to pay me more than the listing said. About two months of working this job, I felt like I was doing pretty good, especially since it was my first retail job. Then suddenly with no warning, they gave my job to someone else and then tried to gaslight me into thinking I had only applied for a seasonal job. They said I had till August, but considering they were giving me lots of unpleasant, pointless tasks to do, I ended up just quitting.\r  \n\r  \nSo now I'm job searching again. I feel so tired. I've been in therapy almost two years. I was on antidepressants for awhile but ended up getting off them since they didn't seem to do anything and made my stomach upset.\r  \n\r  \nI know this next job search isn't anything that I can't overcome, and I think I have enough money to get through a couple months (hopefully enough time to find new work). I'm just SUPER exhausted. I feel like I'm never going to have a career, and I'm stressed about paying my loans off and my medical bills. I just want to get all this off my plate and start doing something meaningful with my time. It feels like I've been stuck for two years.",

    "postText": "My dad commited suicide\n\nMy dad commited suicide and it hurts so bad.\nIt has been a few months, so people think you are done with grieving. I know you have to move on. And I do, I want to move on. Next year I am going to university, I really need a fresh start. A new life. Right now I am living with my mother and my step father. I hate it there. I miss my dad everyday. I wake up, and the thought of \"my dad commited suicide, he is dead\" pops up in my head. I feel so left by him. \nDeath of a loved one is really difficult. When he died, it felt like a part of me died. A part that was happy, hopeful and light-hearted. I can't communicate in the same \"small talk\"-way to friends. My heart feels so heavy. But I have to move on. \nBUT HOW?\nHOW DO I MOVE ON?\ncan somebody please help me, guide me. \nI feel lost and alone in the world.\nHelp me, please.",

            "comment": "First, there's no way you will just get over this and move on.  It takes a very long time to go through the stages of grief. And your heart will always miss your Dad. Don't ever feel you need to get over this faster because of others.  My neice and nephews all lost their Dad's due to their suicides.   No one can replace your Dad.  But you can find other people to look up to or mentor you or teach you things.  Let's face it: today, many kids don't have a Dad, either from divorce, death, drug or other addictions, etc., etc.\nGrief is like the ocean waves. Sometimes you're fine, then the grief washes over you because something has reminded you of your Dad. It will be like this forever, with the waves of grief coming less over time.\n\nThis poem really sums up losing someone you love:\n\n\"The reality is that you will grieve forever. You will not 'get over' the loss of a loved one; you will learn to live with it. You will heal, and you will rebuild yourself around the loss you have suffered. You will be whole again, but you will never be the same. Nor should you be the same, nor would you want to.\"",

My mother has been talking about killing her self for most of my life. I have told her that I don\u2019t care numerous times. It\u2019s true I love her, but if she doesn\u2019t want to be here I am not going to force her. It\u2019s not ideal, or right, or fair whatever it\u2019s never been any of those things. I\u2019m prepared for her to do it, I\u2019ve already grieved. The world is not an ideal place to live for a lot of people. It\u2019s not common, but it can be understandable. I really think if she offs herself maybe that will be better than her just getting drunk everyday talking about all the miserable times in her life. I love her more than anyone in the world, so I am content w letting her go as she chooses.",

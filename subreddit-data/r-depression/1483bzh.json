I feel like the danger is right at the corner, I feel so unprotected and vulnerable.\n\nI'm about to cry and can't find any other distraction to keep me away from suicide.\n\nI might not be a good person but I never thought I deserved to live through this miserable time.\n\nI'm drained as a human being. I just want peace.",

I know it seems hopeless but if I could recover anyone can. I wish I could give anxiety sufferers a glimpse of the crippling anxious state I have been in. Because if they saw it, and saw how I am now, it would give them hope. Anxiety is a very defeatable problem. But you have to take action.",

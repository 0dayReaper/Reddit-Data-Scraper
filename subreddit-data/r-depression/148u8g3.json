    "postText": "It has been a while since I'm feeling like shit. I have felt I don't fight enough for the things in my life, even in my cultural exchange I felt alive for a bit but it didn't work well at the end so I feel guilty for going back to my country again. The job I had there wasn't cool as well. \n\nNow I'm back. I feel guilty because my mom just got recovered of her breast cancer surgery and I'm glad I came back by the time she needed me. But I feel like a fool for not being able to stay there and save money for us to have an apartment and doesn't be dependent of my dad.\n\nI feel like shit for being such a pain in the ass for a past friendship who I can't forget and this time has gotten worse. The fact that I could be better just keep making me feel stupid.\n\nI'm working as a freelancer but everything seems shitty because I'm not being able to organize myself properly and I just procrastinate all day, miss deadlines. I mean I do have a degree but lack of experience from my internships, so I never felt good at anything I did. \n\nSometimes I wish I had a different job but not even that seems possible. I wouldn't mind having an unskilled job but in my country this doesn't pay well as I saw in the US. \n\nI wish I had at least a restart without anything related to my life right now. They say you have to try everything at your 20s, but it seems impossible. Even though everything is possible. \n\nI feel lost and without motivation for all of this. The bad days are just getting back each day. I'm not even wanting to go out, and I have to do it for my mom. But I just can't, it feels bad because she does need me. But I don't feel like I'm helpful enough. I've been saying sad things at home and to my friends to see if my pain goes away but it doesn't help much, so I'm only avoiding human contact.\n\nMy mom wants to travel to see our grandma and family outside the state, but I really don't wanna go to stay alone at home. Eventually I'll have to for her. She can't hold the suitcases. \n\nIdk why I have this solitude, this urge of being completely alone with no one. Being completely far from people when they are trying to help me. I don't want they caring about me when it feels like I don't deserve any of this. I feel like a failure.\n\nI also have been to therapy, which it was helping me but then my therapist started cancelling many appointments justifying that she was feeling sick or someone from her family as well. I know I should look for another therapist but it has been hard. I don't see the time passing by and it gets worse, and worse. Sometimes I'd miss some of them as well. And I really don't like to have it online since my parents are at home and I don't feel comfortable. \n\nI honestly don't know what to do. I have thought about killing myself as well, but instead I just sleep. Lack of energy and low self-esteem. I do hate it.",

    "postText": "Between losing my job (not my fault) and just being a mess all around I've made all my friends pretty much resent me for my behavior. This isn't the first time something like this happened, same thing happened like a year ago when I was also in between jobs.\n\nWe usually play games together since we don't really live close. I've been a dick to everyone, not on purpose but I just can't deal with anyone messing with me. Everything pisses me off, I'm always on edge, everyone bothers me. I don't know why this is happening but it's killing me inside.\n\nEven my girl best friend, the person who I truly loved and cared and would have done anything in the world for, is also pretty much done with me. I feel so alone, I don't have anyone to talk to. She was always my go to person for help but even she is done with my shit.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me or why I'm like this but I've pretty much screwed my entire life. Nothing is going on for me. I don't have friends. I'm alone all day. I go to the gym just to not be able to think about everything. \n\nMaybe it's better they don't speak with me since I'm a horrible friend. Feels like I should just be alone to not bother anyone again\n\nI just want to make everything right but I'm afraid it's too late for that\n\nI've pretty much disappeared from all social media, considering just removing everything since none of my friends deserved a horrible friend like me\n\nThanks for reading",

    "postText": "I feel like everything in my life went wrong. I hate myself and I'm tried. I don't know how to make money. I only need money. But I'm a loser. I keep hyping myself up and trying to convince myself that I just need to work hard. But I'm useless. My family keeps saying that I need to get a degree. But what degree? I wasted my chance the first time I entered college and tried getting the degree I thought my father wanted me to get (I dropped out), and now I can't get another scholarship. I want to blame my parents for being toxic, but I know it's my fault too for being fucking stupid. Fuck those colleges anyways. Why is everything so difficult? Why can't I go study something because I have the desire and ambition? I know it's stupid but I feel so frustrated. I hate people. Any skill I have is not applicable for a job. I can't sell myself or get myself hired with my poor social skills. And I hate interacting with people anyways. Everything is about interacting with people. Fuck this world.",

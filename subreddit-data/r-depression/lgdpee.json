    "postText": "Does anyone else feel like their mind isn't as sharp as it used to be? Back when I was a kid, I was actually able to focus on things and had a pretty good memory. Now, it's like I'm on permanent autopilot. I rarely ever take note of my surroundings or have clear inner monologue. I'm always stuck in this half-awake state where I can't focus on multiple things at once and just kind of \"zone out\" so to speak. I also tend to forget things really quickly for some reason.\n\nIt makes me feel like some useless, brain-dead retard that can't even function normally or think basic thoughts. It's as if my cranium is rotting away or something. I'm stuck with permanent brain fog and there's nothing I can do about it. I take antidepressants and vitamin d pills, I drink lots of water, I eat healthy, but nothing works. \n\nI hate the fact that my brain will never work the same way again, all because of depression. It's destroying my life and I can't take it anymore.\n\nEdit: In case anyone is curious, I don't do drugs or drink alcohol, nor am I old. I'm just a depressed 22 year old dude.",

Depression has made it impossible for me to focus on anything that I used to love, and I feel like I'm living in a constant state of brain-fog where I can't accomplish anything I used to be able to. I look back on the essays I wrote in my first year of college and think, \"I could never write anything that good now.\"\n\nI've been to a doctor and I'm hoping that my new meds will bring me back to my old self, because imagining a lifetime of mental fatigue and autopilot is just unbearable.",

Also I would make sure you're taking Vitamin K2 and Magnesium with your D since without it Vitamin D hardens your arteries and cannot be properly transported around the body especially when taking large doses to correct a deficiency.

Sometimes its barely anything, but its a start that helps me. Also exercise. \n\nAlso please know that good exercise does wonders for grad school. It lets you turn off the \"thinking\" part of your brain and your brain rewards you with positive endorphins. \n\nKnow that after undergrad, our life becomes structure-less with little positive feedback and clarity for how to do tasks.

Some of it\u2019s also from the meds and a lot is from poor sleep. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t know if you want to try this OP but something that does help me is to get outside and get some exercise even when I feel like shit. Sometimes all I can do is walk like a zombie around the block a few times but it still helps and when my body wakes up my brain seems to do so as well. At least for a while.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same as it used to be of course. When I read your post I was thinking how I just told somebody a few days ago that I feel stupid and I used to be smart. But the exercise helps with general cognition and energy levels. I\u2019m not sure what to do about my memory because it works some days and some days it doesn\u2019t. Pain meds definitely affect the memory negatively.\n\nBut another thing I do which I would invite you to try, is meditation. Even if I feel like I can\u2019t do anything else, if I can simply go sit alone in the quiet of my room and meditate for 45 minutes or so, it\u2019s like a different part of my brain takes over and while I\u2019m not working on problem-solving or reading or trying to remember what I\u2019m supposed to be doing, my brain lights up in a different way. It doesn\u2019t mean that the depression just goes away but for that time when I\u2019m sitting and meditating, I feel more aware, and anxiety also will usually decrease. \n\nEither way, you\u2019re not alone in this and I hear your frustration in your post. I hope things improve, for you and for all of us I guess. Take good care everyone.",

What did it to me was the stock market, cryptocurrencies and real estate. Now I know it's easier said than done to \"just do something you like doing\" because lots of us don't know exactly what we like doing, but what I'm trying to get across is that this \"autopilot\" thing that we feel isn't a permanent thing, and it sure is harder to find things to due nowdays as well with this pandemic.",

I was reluctant to try any add on medications because I was worried about the potential for more weight gain. But I went back to my doctor, talked over more options with him, and eventually settled on bupropion (the generic for wellbutrin) as an add-on to my SSRI since wellbutrin doesn't cause weight gain. \n\nI've struggled with some of the brain fog symptoms you described, and after almost 2 weeks of taking wellbutrin on top of my SSRI, I can feel the fog starting to lift. I'm going back to my doctor to discuss my progress and see if the dose is right, but I'm optimistic based on what I've seen so far. I don't know what your specific situation is, but it may be worth talking to your doctor/psychiatrist about add-on meds. \n\nOr if you've already done that, you can disregard my reply entirely lol. Depression is a real bitch, and I sincerely hope you can find some relief.",

By that I mean I understand how draining it can be to talk to multiple doctors or constantly switching medications, especially when you don't have energy in the first place. But everyone responds very differently to medications because our brain chemistry and compositions are different. I think what helped me get through the rut or climb out of the hole was constantly focusing on the way i felt and things i could do when my mental health was under control. THAT drove me to get better. Remember the things you use to love, let that drive you. Also, not for everyone but I started listening to The Mindset Mentor on podcast. Podcasts changed my life. I had something to focus on and it was all positive information that really helped me change my mindset. I think i could go on forever but hopefully some stuff i shared helped. You are loved!",

            "comment": "Not to discourage you to get off antidepressants but i got brain fog whenever i was on them. I finally decided that I'd try to treat depression more naturally. It sucked for a long time but eventually I started getting better sleep (after getting nasal surgery), exercising more, eating healthier, etc. My theory is that depression is usually a symptom of something else going on in the body or mind. I'm not saying I'm cured but I feel a lot better physically and mentally than I used to.",

When I was a teenager felt like I could remember everything, pay attention to so many things at the same time, didn't have to study much for tests because I remembered everything already. Now it feels like my brain is shrinking more each day and I can't focus on anything, besides the numerous thoughts in my head all the time. Feels like my days are so long and exhausting.",

My depression is environmental and a therapist change started to make effects.... I have my brain again!! Just as sharp, witty and reasoning-oriented as it used to be! Please op hold on because I promise you, the feeling of when you suddenly realize your mind is slowly becoming your own again is the best thing that can happen.",

    "postText": "I gave birth 16 months ago. That\u2019s when it all started. I love my child. I love my partner. But I can\u2019t do this anymore. I have a good life. I have a good job. We both make really good money. I don\u2019t really have many friends but I have a few good people in my life. I get myself out of the house with my son and do fun things with my partner. I probably manage to shower enough 75% of the time. I function. I work hard. None of it makes me feel anything. All I feel is sadness. And self hatred. \n\nI\u2019ve had an argument with my partner tonight. He\u2019d been mildly insensitive but to me it feels like I can\u2019t breathe and my skin is crawling. He doesn\u2019t care anymore when I cry, he\u2019s numb to it. He wants me to change but I can\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t want to talk because what\u2019s the point - I\u2019ll be upset if we talk or we don\u2019t so why bother. I\u2019ve been like this for 16 months and no matter what I do nothing feels better. I\u2019m too sensitive. I cry too easily. I get upset too easily.  \n\nI see a psychologist. She\u2019s great. I was making small progress around a month ago - working on getting out of the house, doing things I enjoy, trying to be kinder to myself\u2026 For the last month I\u2019ve gone backwards. I\u2019ve been doing the same things which were helping before, but nothing feels good anymore. Nothing. We\u2019re changing my therapy a little, but I just can\u2019t see a path out of this. \n\nI stopped taking my medication so we can change it to another one. SSRI\u2019s don\u2019t work. All the medication which helped me over the years knock me out, which I can\u2019t have now because I need to be able to wake for my child. \n\nEverything I do has an undertone of misery. I can\u2019t fully engage in anything because all I can think about is how painfully fucking miserable I am. \n\nI\u2019m just done. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m writing this. I wish I could stop being here but I couldn\u2019t do that to my son. Sorry for the pointless post. I\u2019m just not coping.",

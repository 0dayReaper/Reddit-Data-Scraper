    "postText": "Hope this post is not against the rules. Feel free to delete It if It is.\n\nI finally got some profesional help. I'm Lucky enough to have Friends Who care. Seeing how worried they are was a wake up call. People Who never called me suddenly started messaging me. \n\nI've been suicidal ever since i was 8. I'm 40 now\nTried to jump out the Window at 9, luckily a relative Heard me and caught me.\n\nThought the best thing was to ignore the pain forever and pretend everythings alright.socially I'm the funny guy always joking. \n\nNow the suicidal thoughts are stronger than ever.\n\nI cannot run away from the pain anymore.\n\nAll my Friends say my childhood was shit.\n\nMom was a con artist and a prostitute\n\nDad was a alcoholic Who would say i dont deserve to be loved and would beat me with bottles of whiskey when i was 8.\nHe died a bit later.\n\nStep dad was a cocaine and heroin dealer. Surprisingly a lovely dude besides cocaine fulled raging episodes when he would destroy our flat.\n\nMy cousin hung herself, Friends threw themselves under trains. Its a shitshow.\n\nI'm now homeless even though i have a job.\nI'm also alcoholic and a cocaine user. \n\nHow ironic.\n\nI realised my Will to live is stronger than my Will to die. \n\nI Hope i could be Happy someday.\n\nI think love is the only thing worth living for\n\nMy point is dont be ashamed to ask for help. Its worth trying. It helped me realise there is a cause or a reason for this suffering and i'm not guilty of It.\n\nSorry for the rambling. \n\nI know its hard. And when you hate yourself and hate Life everythings feels pointless.",

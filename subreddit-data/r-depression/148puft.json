    "postText": "i keep trying to get better but it doesn\u2019t seem to go anywhere. i literally don\u2019t contribute anything, i\u2019m not self-sufficient (dependent on my parents at 25), and i\u2019m not happy at all. i don\u2019t think i have been since i was like 12.\n\ni don\u2019t think i\u2019m nice. i\u2019ve been trying to be kinder and more open with people but somehow i think i always end up acting closed off and bitter. it slips out at unpredictable moments because i\u2019m fundamentally unhappy and insecure. i don\u2019t know how to be helpful to people when it seems like it comes naturally for others, like they always know what to do or what to say when someone needs something.\n\ni want to pursue some sort of passion but i hardly have any energy. i want to contribute to something meaningful but i can\u2019t seem to figure out how. i\u2019m in grad school but i think i made the wrong choice, i\u2019m unhappy in this program and i don\u2019t know what to do next. i have creative interests but all i can manage to do is draw in a tiny sketchbook every now and then.\n\ni don\u2019t like how i look. i have gender dysphoria and wish i could look gender neutral but i\u2019m short with a feminine body type. i\u2019ve never dated anyone.\n\ni feel like i wasn\u2019t built for this and i\u2019m really really tired. i frequently fantasize about disappearing somewhere where everyone can forget about me and i can just sleep as long as i want.",

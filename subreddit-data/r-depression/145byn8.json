    "postText": "I feel like it would make the decision of ending my life so much easier if I knew that my passing wouldn\u2019t cause devastating damage. I have loved ones who depend on me and also have their own mental health battles. I feel like me ending my life would just be too cruel and selfish. But I\u2019m also a burden on them by continuing to be depressed and having to lean on them so much.\n\nI wish I could go and know that my loved ones will be taken care of. But unfortunately, that\u2019s an unrealistic fantasy. \n\nI hate being stuck in a lose-lose situation.",

            "comment": "I can very much relate to this sentiment. I\u2019m a rainbow baby (my parents lost my older brother when he was a baby, a year before me) and I was 3 months premature\u2026 I truly think if I wasn\u2019t cognicent of how badly my parents wanted me and struggled to have me, their own mental health struggles etc., it\u2019d be a lot easier to just say peace out. I know my parents love me, and support me, while going through all their own shit, but it\u2019s so hard to accept the feeling of love without guilt. I constantly feel like a burden and that my friends probably all secretly hate me and I\u2019m a fraud. It sucks. I\u2019m here with you and sending a genuine \u2018I love you\u2019 your way. \ud83e\ude77",

            "comment": "As much as I relate, I think it's super selfish of others to keep me in a place I hate than just accepting to let go and let me earn the freedom I someday want. I'm not 30 yet and have hope for my 30s opening up in a way maybe my 20s didn't show me. But in no circumstances would I ever stick around just for someone. Like you guys want me to be alive so you don't feel devastated? TOO BAD!!",

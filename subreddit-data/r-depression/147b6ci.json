Here I am, sitting on a patio, envying a moth... this creature.. perhaps wishing he was a butterfly, or something to be marveled as beautiful. Instead he was born a moth... drawn to the light but burned, killed by the very touch of it. No matter how much it tries, it still is considered expendable, able to be ignored.. nearly worthless. If only there were a human sized bug zapper.",

You deserve to acknowledge and reward yourself for how far you\u2019ve gone and the accomplishments you have achieved. Give yourself time to rest as well. You can be selfish. Be selfish in a way that\u2019s best for you. You\u2019re doing great and I\u2019m so happy for how far you\u2019ve gone. Don\u2019t forget to be easy on yourself as well. No one is dealing with it the way you are and that\u2019s ok. You deserve to be happy and live for yourself. (:",

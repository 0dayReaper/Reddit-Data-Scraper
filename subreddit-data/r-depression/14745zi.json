Awful to say I hate them,\nbut it's how I feel.....when I get off phone I want to kill myself and cry .... hearing how fun everyone else is sets me off....\n\nThis site has HELPED me tremendously because this is the first time I hear others who experience what I do....and I feel less lonesome\n\nSo.. THANK YOU",

Sometimes when I hear something bad may or has happened I get a tinge of happiness. Makes me feel awful and I quickly tell off my brain for being so selfish and cruel. I guess misery loves company.",

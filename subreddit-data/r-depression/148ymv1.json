I don\u2019t want to kill myself because I know I have so much to live for but I\u2019m so so so so so tired of feeling like this. I\u2019m so tired of feeling so depressed and having these constant headaches from time to time. I\u2019m so depressed because i have this really bad fear of being left out. Meeting new people is so scary because I\u2019m scared I\u2019m gonna get left out. Left out is such a shitty feeling, being left out makes me feel so worthless and feels like no one cares about me at all. Which is not true but my mind likes to think like that a lot. I have a really bad mindset and I\u2019m trying to find peace but i honestly just cant. I\u2019ve find comfort into my depression but i wanna leave my depression so fucking bad. I\u2019m so tired of feeling like I\u2019m worthless, no one cares about me, or I\u2019m gonna be alone forever. I overthink so much it\u2019s so painful. I\u2019m trying to train my mind to be stronger than my feelings but i cant man why is it so hard bro\ud83d\ude2d. Why do I feel like everything has to be about me, it\u2019s so annoying. My depression has gotten really bad this month and it\u2019s literally summer like what the fuck i should be enjoying my summer but instead I\u2019m overthinking everything and being depressed as fuck\ud83d\ude2d. I want to get rid of this bad mindset and just be happy again like i use to be. I was never like this. It happened out of nowhere and idk what to do bro. I don\u2019t want my life to be like this forever or I\u2019ll be miserable. Why is being left out so scary to me? I just want a peace of mind man.",

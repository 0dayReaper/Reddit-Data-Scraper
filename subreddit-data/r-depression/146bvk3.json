    "postText": "Hi everyone.\nSo I think most of you know the feeling when you're just questioning your life and your life decisions, especially when you're depressed.\nRecently I talked to a guy who is younger than me (we are both in our 20s) whose life is so different and the opposite of mine. \n\nHe has like a lot of friends and is social af, always goes out with friends, has lived abroad, just lives life the way he wants to and does whatever he feels like doing.\nI on the other hand have no friends at all due to 5 years of severe depression, no social life, no life experiences. I kinda forcibly got myself together thanks to a busy schedule consisting of work, study and doing sports. It's going well, every now and then depression strikes again and my moods go down for a while but never too long lasting.\n\nTalking to this guy had a different, so much bigger impact on me and kicked me right back into depression. I don't know if it happened by chance that it triggered me so much but now I feel like I have wasted so many years and I have not lived at all and made me again aware of my non-existing social life and how I have no friends...\n\nDo y'all think the feeling is temporary?  I know we shouldn't compare our lives other peoples lives but I do feel like I need to change the way I live my life or am I wrong?",

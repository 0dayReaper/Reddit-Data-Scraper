Feel like my mind is going and I feel like this might finally be it for me.  Even after all I\u2019ve survived these last years.  It is happening very suddenly.  I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to make it and all the Hell-fears are back.\n\nPlease talk to me.  Please pray or send positive thoughts \u2014 anything.\n\nI will try my best to respond.",

Please know that you are not alone. The only reason I even checked this sub rn was because I was feeling down and wanted to show to myself that I am not alone. I am not alone, and neither are you. You have done a good thing reaching out. Please reach out to someone who you know. You are stronger than you think and more loved than you know. Never give up",

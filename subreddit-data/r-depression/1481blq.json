    "postText": "I'd never expected these things to happen in my life. Right after I graduated, problems came in to my life. I lost my normal day cycle. I have no job so I dont have responsibility to be somewhere. I lost ability to sleep well or feeling to eat. I don't want to hangout with anyone no more. I just lay on my couch, consume entertainment and go for smokes on my balcony. The time when I was in school, I had \"normal\" life. I actually wanted to do things and I was happier. Its been 5 months of this sh\\*t. Everyday the same boring things on repeat. Maybe I will find a job and actual place where I have responsibility to go. ",

Things are boring and the same everyday? So do something exciting! No one gonna just come by and infuse excitement into your life, you gotta go do it yourself",

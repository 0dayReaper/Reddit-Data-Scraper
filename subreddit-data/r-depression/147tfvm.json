    "postText": "I think all my childhood and school was the most full filing and beautiful time of my life. Couldn\u2019t have asked for more , great and loving and most importantly supportive parents and a very close reliable younger sibling as my family and a well off family with quite a reputation of my parents. I have the most wonderful friends that I made over my school time I\u2019m still close to, always having my back. Got to experience \u201c love\u201d in high school and I think I was leading the life of a Romcom main lead. But I think the genre turned into pure horror for me since lockdown. The fear due to covid and a drop year , the very first failure of not getting enough marks in one exam took a toll on my so called smart ass brain and so started a series of panic attacks. My father was always there for me during this time but since I moved to college , not being happy with anything here, not being close to my loved ones, the feeling of being alone and not having a partner who loves me and I can rely on basically I slipped into depression. At 21, when every other person of my age I see is carefree, exploring and hustling here i am not able to work on things I used to love doing just being idle and faking being ok because I can\u2019t ask for help even from my own parents. Sometimes I be a hypocrite assuming why should I rely on someone to even get better in the end all of us come alone and go alone but I\u2019m still so lonely in a room full of people I\u2019m just seeing myself isolating myself to an insane level. Me wanting to have everything is just slipping out of my hands in front of my eyes and I can\u2019t do anything. My family is so hurt seeing me in this state I don\u2019t want to be a burden to them I just feel too guilty. At this time I so wish I had a partner who could just let me cry in front of them and give me a hug but I am just being used by people rn breaking my heart multiple times. I can\u2019t ask my friends anymore cause I don\u2019t want to show them this side of me Infact no one cause I miss my confident and bold self. This intense feeling of guilt is eating me away and I really don\u2019t know how to get over this. I just want this phase to pass quickly cause eceryday feels like a task to go through .",

I know college can be crazy but that time goes pretty quickly and you'll be glad you stuck it out. Get that career you're striving for and everything else will fall into place.",

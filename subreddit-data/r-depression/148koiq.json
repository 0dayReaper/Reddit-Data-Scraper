    "postText": "I can't do anything right. My mother is pregnant with her 6th child and I don't really like it. I have 5 siblings 3 of which I can't stand. Earlier today I asked her where the baby would go. She got upset and started saying how it wasn't any of my business and that it's none of my and that if me and my sister are going to give her attitude we're free to live with our father. She knows our father is kind of a deadbeat. She knows that I've been asking him to live with him for almost 5 years now. I heard her earlier telling her husband that it was a stupid question and who was I to ask that. I didn't even mean it in a bad way. I didn't ask out of concern or fear I was just genuinely curious. I've overheard her talking to my sister about how she thinks I'm faking it. What if I am faking it?? What if I unconsciously/subconsiously made everyone think I'm depressed? What if I unconsciously manipulated people to think that. If I did I genuinely did not mean to. I don't even know if Im not faking it. My immediate family hates me. My grades have been dropping ever since I entered secondary school. I'm overweight and I have extremely short hair that refuses to grow. My boyfriends have only liked me for my body. Nobody in my life genuinely likes me and wants to be around me. I can't do this anymore. I'm not even old enough to have a job much less move out. I'm short, overweight, part of the LGBT community, and almost bald. What a combination. I don't think I contribute anything amazing to society. I think I might end my life. I have basically no reason to live so why continue in this never-ending cycle of suffering and self disgust. I'm a waste of air and flesh. I wish I had never been born. My family wouldn't have to go through the dismay of meeting me. I've been a coward and a pussy up till now and I only ever thought about killing myself. I think I might finally try for once.\n\n\nSorry for the long post and to those who had to see this mess of ranting and self disgust. I probably won't be here much longer so atleast that's one good thing about this post:)",

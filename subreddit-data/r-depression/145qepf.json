    "postText": "I had been doing good for a while. Actually was foolish enough to think that I had turned a corner and things could improve. \n\nBut life started kicking me over and over. And now while I tried to smile, I lose a friend to death, I\u2019m nearly broke, nearly homeless. Totally alone. \n\nThe pit always wins. You can never crawl out. Just crawl up until the pit caves and you slide back to the bottom.  \n\nGlad I didn\u2019t throw out those sleeping pills I found last week. Maybe they can get me out of the pit once and for all.",

Even homeless you can watch a sunset and hear the birds chirp. You can feel small success with enough effort. Life is Pain, Work and Uncertainty but that\u2019s okay because we are all along for the ride together. Please just keep trying. You won\u2019t ever get to the rim of the toilet bowl of life but maybe you can coast for a bit and enjoy the water before you get flushed. Love you.",

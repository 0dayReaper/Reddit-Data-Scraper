    "postText": "I was a shitty bf. I couldn't change. All I'd do was get irrationally mad at everyone especially my ex. She was so kind to me. I wanted to change but why the fuck couldn't I? Why couldn't I be the person she deserved? It doesn't matter that I've changed now. What's the point. I don't want to live like this. It's so lonely. And I'm not important to anyone anymore. I want her to take me back. I'll do anything. I've already changed. I've controlled my anger issues anf stopped self harming. I want her. I miss her. I'm sorry J. Please give me another chance. I'm better. I can't live like this. I never wanted to hurt you. I never wanted to. I changed. Please",

I said a really awful thing at the end and I have changed my view and I don't think she will ever forgive me. I wish I could go back as well.",

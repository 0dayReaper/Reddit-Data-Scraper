    "postText": "\rHi,\r  \n\r  \nI live in Dallas, TX and the IOP programs here are really not that good. I was wondering if anybody here has experience with going to another state for an eating disorder and/or mental health intensive outpatient program? Is that something that can be done?\r  \n\r  \nAlso, I would love to hear if anyone has recommendations for IOP places!\r  \n\r  \nThanks!",

I'm saying that often a person who fails tends to blame their failure on others.\n\n\"they didn't treat me well\" could be \"I didn't' want to be told the blunt truth\"\n\nrather than, \"as long as they were getting paid, what happened to me did not matter to them\"\n\nTo obtain quality, you have to define it.  For example, \"Research shows that Texas IOPs have an 80% relapse rate.  I will only enter a program with lower than 20% relapse rate\"\n\nThe reality is, a huge number of these clinics are scams.  I don't envy you the difficult research task ahead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThy",

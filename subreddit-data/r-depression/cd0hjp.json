Nothing else. No social life. No hobbies. Constantly battling your mind. And being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time.",

Last year was my first time as lead teacher I'm a self-contained classroom. My anxiety got so bad I had almost constant heart palpitations in and out of work. I would feel shaky going in the building not knowing what parent I'd have to deal with, and that I'd have to attempt to teach while the aides in my room sat on their phones. And then had attitudes when corrected. \n\nAll I did when I got home was 1) more work 2) maybe eat a meal 3) escape into YouTube or music or books 4) sleep. \n\nI decided the job is not worth my mental health. Which of course led to guilt over leaving my students. Of course I do work on my mental health, but going to a job with zero support and aides who are in fact children themselves is just not gonna work! \n\nThe building is already on fire and I'm not a fire fighter.",

Every day spent like that felt like I was digging myself deeper and I was well aware of that at the time but you're kind of totally unmotivated to do anything when you're that depressed. I have no real problem getting out of bed now or doing the bare necessities from day to day. But I don't really feel excited about anything. Everything is just kind of boring. Sometimes it's like I forget about it though and enjoy watching a movie or something. I might even get brief moments of hope for the future and I get this good feeling that feels awfully familiar. Kind of like some form of nostalgia for the feelings of being genuinely happy or at least not being unhappy in the past. It's hard to explain...  \n\n\nI got a bunch of things to actually be happy about. So I kind of feel bad sometimes that I don't. There's a lot of people out there in way worse situations than me but that doesn't really help me with coping with my own depression. I just feel like every day is an equation that adds the sum of the events from that day and you either have a net gain or loss in happiness. And over time you either get better or worse in small incremental steps, so you're not really aware of what way you're going or what is working. I try to listen to my feelings but I'm not even sure that I interpret them correctly. Feeling hungry often makes me nauseous as I don't get the urge to eat and just go hungry instead. And when I actually eat then it's not satisfying or anything. I just eat because I know I have to. I procrastinate stuff I'm anxious about even though I know I will feel better when I take care of them. Like showering for example. I can smell terrible and hate to be around myself for a day or two and sometimes even a week... And know that it will get better if I just shower. But why the hell can't I just motivate myself to take those 10-30 minutes and not feel like crap for days on end? It's like I'm doing this to myself and I'm totally aware of it and I still can't just do more than the bare minimum.  \n\n\nI'm sorry. I lost my train of thought and gotta go lie down a bit. I usually re-read my comments a thousand times before deleting or posting them. I thought I'll disregard that and just post this.",

I use to be more ashamed of it, but now I'm perfectly open with people when I don't want to sit in front row at a company meeting or event. I also just take my supplements/meds at my desk, not openly but I don't mind people seeing it either. It feels good to just let people know when they ask so the fake smiles feel less like a lie. And once or twice I have talked to people who ask and helped them out which always gives me a pick me up for a while.",

That you\u2019re just looking for attention. You leave breadcrumbs but no one picks them up XD\n\nBut the way I see it is that because we\u2019re functional, we\u2019re not complete outsiders. We still have a foot in the door. I can\u2019t imagine what it must be like for people who are completely cut off from society, or entirely incapable of carrying out the daily norms. Imagine trying to get from there to functional. \n\n10 years ago, I spent 6 months in my room, jobless, with crippling social anxiety to the point of having my eyes permanently to the ground, even with family, all as a previously working adult. And I wouldn\u2019t wish the same thing on my worst enemy. \n\nSo I\u2019m grateful. Even if being a functional depressee carries its own challenges, I\u2019m grateful I don\u2019t have to deal with the experience of feeling completely and utterly alienated. As in, at least I can ask a cashier how their day has been and feel like I\u2019ve left the daily cage I live in, or contact people that I know, if very casually, and do something they find fun, or chat to people at work about something entirely random.\n\nYes, the fake smile disappears the moment I\u2019ve left the interaction, but at least I had a reason to smile in the first place.",

I didn\u2019t leave my room for months, wouldn\u2019t shower for weeks at a time, wouldn\u2019t eat or drink for days at a time, would be too weak and drained to even use the toilet. Moments when I was conscious or had enough energy to do anything I would spend the time cutting everybody off, deleted every app, blocked people from calling or texting me and on every social media site. I went through cycles of feeling numb/empty/worthless to waves of sadness or extreme anger and resentment. I felt the crippling social anxiety part.. before the severe period of depression I went to work like a zombie, I would leave the store and sit outside in a back alley hating my entire existence. When I was in the store I wouldn\u2019t do anything and I just felt how angry and how much all of my coworkers hated me, and that made it even worse. They would roll their eyes at me and mock me when I was trying to help or just brush me off completely. I felt like such a worthless, pathetic loser. Afterwards I felt so angry that I didn\u2019t stand up for myself when people snapped on me when I was really trying. At that moment I knew I couldn\u2019t even support myself or stand up for myself because I hated myself just as much as they did.",

I had a 20 year chronic, worsening depression and I finally found some proper mental health care and some medications which resulted in what I can't say is a complete 180 but what is certainly an improvement.  I was marred for a while, 14 years, in fact.  At the time I met my now ex wife my chronic depression wasn't too bad, it worsened during my marriage and, following my divorce it became much worse (or more accurately I did't have a person and two dogs I had to put my happy mask on and play my part in a life that wasn't my own and once those things were gone I no longer had to play the part and I didn't).  My divorce was way back in 2009.  For the next nine years I walked the daily circle of nothingness: wake, work, home, wake, work, home, come Friday night, go to bed and stay there Monday morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, even though I am feeling better than I was, I am still on that same circle track but making efforts here and there.  I want to do more things, get out, learn new things, take up a new hobby, but that decade I spent on the functional depression cycle alone and constantly in my own head is a tough thing to break away from.  If all of us are honest, the ones that live with functional depression who sequester themselves away for everything but work, isn't part of the reason we do that to not have a negative impact on the people around us?  It is one of the biggest reasons I do.\n\nI actually met someone along the way, a person I wanted spend time with, be around, get to know much better and to have in my life for the rest of it.  Trouble was we met when I was about as far down the depression pit as I could have been and despite my best efforts to organize my life into one I would have been able to share with another person, even at a superficial level, I managed to f\\*ck it all up.  Granted I wasn't in a position at the time to do much more than plan a trip to the bathroom let alone do execute something of the scope I was trying to but, damn.  That was a loss, the potential of what could have been, at least what I imagine it could have been.  I wish we had met after I had started to work seriously on metal health but we didn't.  She is the reason I did finally seek treatment and for that, to her, I am forever thankful.",

Im the life of the party, but the truth is I find people exhausting and if given the choice I would just like to be alone. Which isn't healthy for me.\n\nSo Ive made a point of only drinking when Im around other people. Its like a reward mechanism for me, if I ever started drinking alone it would become a problem quickly.",

All my coworkers hated me and would stare at me which made my anxiety worse but I would literally zone out and just stare at nothing for hours. This type of job was unfulfilling anyway, there was no real job description and when there was shit to do they worked me like a mule while complaining about how I\u2019m not getting things done fast enough... it was just a very toxic environment to be in while having my depression and anxiety worsen. I hated myself so much and summed up everything to be my fault.",

Somehow, most mornings I still wake up thinking today will be the day I start to turn things around. And by noon I'm wishing a meteorite would crash into me and vaporize my existence because I can't see any positive possibilities.

The only people I consider family is my co-worker, which I live with her and her husband and daughter, other then that I don't have friends either, All I do is go to work and online school on my days off.. Between work, school and sleeping I just don't think about anything and it passes the time.",

You are not a shitty person at all. Believe me, I'm saying this from my experience. If deep down you know that you did wrong to some and then you said sorry. You did your part. Now next step is to forgive yourself. We are all human and not always in the right state of mind.  Don't feel guilty for that instead start fresh and don't repeat past mistakes in your new relationship. Love yourself first, practice gratitude for example, every day wake up and say thanks to GOD that you have courage to wake up from your bed because most people don't have that courage. You are not a SHITTY person..",

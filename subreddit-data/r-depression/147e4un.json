Im aware of the impact my death would have, and people would be worse off if I died. As I\u2019m writing it, I\u2019m reminded of that fact and in the end I could never do something that could hurt them in that way. Maybe it makes me sound a bit narcissistic, but I do believe that my life in general has tons of value to others even if it has none to myself",

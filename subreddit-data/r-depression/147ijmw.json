    "postText": "My depression is really bad at the moment, I keep making excuses to work to not come in, I\u2019ve always suffered with it but it\u2019s the worst it\u2019s ever been I didn\u2019t even know I could feel this bad, it\u2019s drained me from any energy no matter now hard I try to get a lot of sleep and eat good. I\u2019m feeling guilty about work because I love my work but I mentally can\u2019t handle it sometimes, and then it makes me feel worse because I think they\u2019re angry at me and know I\u2019m lying about why I\u2019m calling in sick then I regret it. I just feel like I\u2019m in a really bad cycle that I can\u2019t get out of and I don\u2019t know what to do I feel like I\u2019m pissing off everyone around me because of it",

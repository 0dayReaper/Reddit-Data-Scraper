I\u2019m in a dark place and it\u2019s taking a toll on me in a major way. I\u2019m not ok at all but I\u2019m trying. \n\nI think I just need to know that somebody out there knows that. \n\nAnd I\u2019m here for whoever else needs it too. \n\nCan you guys please share with me what you\u2019re doing or have done to get out of the darkest place you\u2019ve been? I want to be here and I want to be better.",

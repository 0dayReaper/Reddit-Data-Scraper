                            "comment": "I can relate to this so much. I usually find these two methods work:\n\n1) You call in sick and find relief in the knowledge that if you did go in, your work productivity wouldn't be anywhere near AS good as it would be if you just took a few days to rest and recover. So it's in their interest as much as it is in yours. \n\nIf I do this, I usually spend half a day in bed sleeping, feeling sorry for myself, allowing myself to feel worthless and all the other emotions that come with depression. Then I do a bit of honest journaling. And finally, I set the simplest To Do list imaginable (have shower, make tea, sweep bedroom). It doesn't matter how slowly you do it, but moving around helps (bonus if you can force yourself outside for 10 mins). And it really boosts your self esteem knowing you completed some or all of the tasks you set yourself.\n\n2) You force yourself to go in, tell your boss you're not 100% but you didn't want to call in sick. This way, you can go easy on yourself at work and your boss will know that your dedicated to your job.\n\nI only do this if my depression isn't super low or if I've already taken a day off to recover but I'm not fully myself yet. Again, take each job as it comes, don't even set yourself a target. Just focus on one small task at a time.\nSometimes I go through periods of staring at my computer screen wondering why the fuck I even came in. But by the end of the day I feel much better in the knowledge that I managed just one day back at work.\n\nSometimes the fear of facing a day at work with that heavy dark cloud over your head is enough to make you run and hide in the back of your wardrobe, away from the world. Sometimes you just need a little push, do little things in the morning (get dressed, brush teeth, drive to work) telling yourself that if you still don't feel good, even by the time you make it to the car park, you can always turn around and try again tomorrow.\n\nAlso talking to co-workers throught the day seemed like a chore at first, but again, towards the end of the day, it became easier and I began to feel more like myself. Treat yourself to something sweet or comforting (chocolate or soup), to reward yourself for coming so far.\n\nSorry for the enormous comment, but I thought I'd give my 2 cents on how I tackle work with depression. Some of it might be relatable to your situation. Most of it is probably useless \ud83d\ude05",

In the less expensive treatment styles Ive sought, ive been told, anonymously of course, that when those days sneak up on me I need to think about what is triggering this odd mode that I fall into and look at my thoughts as though they are fears. Addressing the fear out loud to myself, followed by positive affirmations within a pep talk (to myself), I am challenged with facing a fear instead of crawling back into bed. I hope this helps friends as I left out the part where I take a hand full of pills whether I go to work or not, so I usually cool off. Besides professional help, I swear that proper sleep, diet, and exercise give me low doses of what the meds give me artificially. Ive just recently bounced back from another month long spell in which I fucked nearly everything up with my problems. I felt like sharing something so thanks for reading. I always tell myself when I get stuck that I am not the only one going through this. It makes me a bit bigger after my disease has made me so small and isolated without me even noticing. We need to give ourselves a break sometimes because we've been through enough, and we deserve it. Cheers",

Couldn't let anyone know I'm antisocial because they'd fire me for not being outgoing. Had to be optimistic because they'd know I'm depressed and fire me for not being optimistic. One day was so bad, I seriously considered taking my life before work, and decided to just tell my team lead. Only reason why I caved in was because I didn't care about the consequences.\n\nThat day I learned that my job has resources for those who suicidal tendencies and depression. I was actually told that lots of people have this job because it's hard to have in-person jobs when you're not a very social person. They will allow you to take off time or be away from work for it. Like someone said, it's an illness. Someone can't fire you for it. If someone does, that's discrimination. You shouldn't fire or not hire someone with depression or a mental illness.\n\nIf you need to take away, then by all means you should consider discussing that with your managers. And even then, I know depression isn't a simple topic just tell them you're not feeling well. Not feeling well mentally is the same as not feeling well physically.",

I know what logical fallacies my brain is prone to in this state because I know what parts it effects neurologically. I know i'm less well versed in reading emotions or a room. So instead if keeping it in and spiralling I usually proclaim that I'm suffering from depression right now and that if people have questions I'm very willing to answer them. And it helps because you realize almost everyone can relate and no one thinks it's th\u00e1t weird. I think it's just one of those tricks depression plays on your mind. It makes you feel like people think you're weirder than they actually think you are.",

Time moves quick but my mind doesn't. I can't get past the feelings of missing my ex though I got married last month. I have been binge drinking for a long time now. I'm not sure how long anymore. I can't sleep if I don't drink. I can't handle being around people. I don't like going to stores, grocery shopping ECT. I don't trust anyone. Though this probably stems from much more than the divorce. It's been a rough deal for me. As it is with many people. I have no idea how to deal with life. I say I'm ok. I push through most days fine. But there is a part of me that's just tired. Tired all the time. A part that doesn't eat to deal anymore. It's fleeting. I watch people going through life seeming like there happy. I want that. Though I'm not sure what that would look like. My new wife has children. I'm not sure how to be a dad. If I'm not good for myself how am I supposed to try and raise children. I want the best for them. I can't even deal with my baggage. I put up a strong front but inside I'm torn up. Hell im not even sure what love is supposed to feel like. I can't even trust people. I don't even understand how the hell im married again. I have been completely honest with my wife about how I feel. Yet I can't bring myself to talk about my feelings most times. I don't know, I just wanted to share. Best regards.",

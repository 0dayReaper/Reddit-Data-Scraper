    "postText": "But depression is much more than that. \r\n\nIt\u2019s the excuses you have to make when you can\u2019t make that meeting. \r\n\nIt\u2019s the friends and family you\u2019ve lost because you can\u2019t explain why. \r\n\nIt\u2019s the opportunities that land in everyone else\u2019s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. \r\n\nIt\u2019s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. \r\n\nIt\u2019s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. \r\n\nIt\u2019s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. \r\n\nIt\u2019s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. \n\r\nIt\u2019s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. \r\n\nIt\u2019s the wall that blocked you off from life. \n\nIt's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. \n\nIt\u2019s not just being \u201csad\u201d. And we can only wish it was. \n\n*Edited to add: Thank you all for the kind words and awards. I really didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. I wrote this in an attempt to put my experience with depression into words, and to serve as a reminder of what it feels like, for the times when normal people try to tell me my depression isn't real or otherwise downplay it.*",

And then there's the ones that also feel depressed and can't process their emotions. Much like the rest of us can't.  They feel the need to happy. To put on that front, and when these people face someone strong enough to vulnerably reveal their depression, these people want to hide or just get them to be happy or pretend to be. It's the fear of what might happen if they try to take off that happy mask. Vulnerability is a scary thing for most people. It has been a scary thing for me for a long time. I hated being around people who were strong enough to admit that they aren't in a good space and possibly needed help. I was taught to be strong and not show any emotion except happy. No one in my real life knows what i go through. Because they think \"life is good\". I used to be that person too thinking the situation will get better an i should just be happy. If pretend to be happy,  I'll eventually be be happy.",

Have you noticed the trend?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDepressed people are the best. Because they know how awfully we've been living, and they hang on for another day in an implied hope that things will improve. But the only way they improve is if you do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRest assured that this popsicle stick reality will blow over one day, and what will be left is the essence of you who are and the realization that you weathered the storm of it. The moment you stop believing in something greater (and creating it) is the moment you've tricked yourself into accepting that the human-concocted jellybean race is the official universal plan. That would be known as a collective delusion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave you bothered to mop yourself up for a moment to take the time to visit an empty field so you can just look at the stars lately on something other than your computer screen, feeling the freezing cold air and wind just to know you are alive? There is only one natural reality, and it's the magical one that affords you the ability to perceive in the first place. It's the majesty of space and time themselves and how our particles adhere to one another to create the construction of our forms in the first place. Our genetics is the sequencing that hold us together, and we share a common code base. And this magic is so powerful that a minority of confused people on Earth have tried to rip it away and remove you from your own primality by redefining your context within this vast sea of miracles. What's depressing about reality is that we've allowed this to occur, and we uphold it with the decisions we make every moment of the day when we could simply step out of it together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're depressed, no one is going to physically  come along and tell you, \"well, maybe you should use your intelligence and creativity again\". No one will know to detect that this is why you are hopeless. Do not accept the garbage idea that \"depression is a condition and a disease\" that you are stuck with. That powerless stance only lines the pockets of evil giants and deepens the above-described delusion. Every ailment originates first as an ill condition and then progressively worsens. Take accountability for what you can and forgive yourself for what you can't change anymore. Depression is holding grudges against yourself and living out the punishments. Ask yourself and decide how you are going to change poor attitudes that have gotten in your way, how to acknowledge the tough things you won't admit to yourself and to others due to your shame. Explore the things you *can* improve but have insofar chosen not to. Un-tangle your ball of emotions and unravel your experience into something that **suits you**, not other people. Even if the horrible days still come, at least you will have ones you can recall were much better and much more successful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is not a soul on this board who has never had a good day in his or her life. It's just been the choice to focus on the trauma points that has allowed for the deterioration into a state of complete despair or suicide to occur. Your presence on this board implies a desire to heal if you can stop to see that. But in order for things to get better, you have to find your successes and amplify them, overcoming any barriers (including people-as-barriers) who have gotten in your way to becoming the whole you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you were lost in a forest, the first step to finding your way would be believing that there is a way through. Or you might uniquely discover that the forest was always your home and being lost in it marked your return from somewhere else you had been lost. Consider a new perspective today. It's really important to constantly do so in order to find the reasoning and proof that you really *do* want to be excited, expressive, satisfied, and progressive. Being free is your eternal, default state. Being stuck is only a temporary hinderance within that.",

            "comment": "I just recently started seeing a therapist. But due to the system being shitty and her being over booked, I have to wait 6 weeks before I can start having weekly sessions.\n\nAs such, I noticed I have way less sex than before (as I type this, it's been 12 days since I last slept with my wife). I masturbate, but it's barely stimulating. Some nights, I skip it all together. \n\nUltimately, nothing excites me anymore. I even have an anniversary trip coming up and all I can think about is all the school work I need to finish early just so my vacation doesn't feel completely pointless. That, and the fact that I'll technically get more sleep due to not having to go into work for two weeks.\n\nYeah. These long gaps in between therapy sessions are killing me.",

            "comment": "More people need to understand the difference between the two. Sadness is an emotion that everyone experiences, but that feeling eventually fades and get replaced with another. Depression is the perpetual feeling of everything described in the OP. \n\nThe analogy I\u2019ve heard and I like the best is: telling a depressive person there\u2019s lots to be happy about is like telling an asthmatic they should never have trouble breathing because there\u2019s plenty of air. It\u2019s something the body cannot do (in most cases) on its own. More people need to understand this. \n\nBottom line: we shouldn\u2019t have to prove the severity or existence of our diagnosis.",

    "postText": "I've been holding my tongue on this for awhile. Ever since my step-family moved in (three siblings), I've just been feeling left out. For the past few weeks they would all go out for breakfast, go out and about shopping, and other things and they never ask me if I want to go with them. \n\nThey never wake me up and ask if I want anything or if want to join them. It's like, \"okay, fuck you too\" I guess?\n\nI can't talk to my father either because everything goes in and out his ear. \n\nI might as well be invisible.",

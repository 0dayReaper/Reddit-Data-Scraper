    "postText": "We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

I'm not speaking just to you, /u/scorpiontank27), but to everyone who's been upvoting this comment.\n\nIn addition to what /u/circinia has so wisely pointed out, there's another reason why it's a sign that's something's seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule.  \n\nIf you're really thinking about others' experience, then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you.  If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when \"we want to help\", what it means is that \"we want to feel helpful\".  \"PM me any time\" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.",

We know a lot of our OPs have privacy concerns, but we think that using a throwaway account (we have disabled all the settings that prevent new or low-karma accounts from posting) is a better option in that case.",

I\u2019ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   \n  \nAnd even as I didn\u2019t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren\u2019t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  \n  \nIt is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. \u201cPM me anytime\u201d isn\u2019t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don\u2019t deserve the time and attention.  \n  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP\u2019s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with \u201cPM me if you want to answer privately\u201d. Now OP won\u2019t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn\u2019t initiate a conversation \u2014 it has already been initiated. As you said, it\u2019s better not to offer to PM and as it\u2019s a rule now nobody should do it \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where \u201cPM me\u201d is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \n  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers\u2019 problems.",

Not without care or consideration, but catered specifically to be a body to talk to and knowing the intention behind it, ironically made me feel obligated to politely respond, but pussyfooted (for a lack of a better word) in my attitude. \n\nThis is only because I know it's a sincere, but more importantly, an instantly sympathetic reaction to a sad post. It's not something I expect to be a meaningful, lasting relationship, but one born for a moment out of immediate sympathy. Like a hand on the shoulder. \n\nI do appreciate them. I really do, but I also can do without it, and like the moderators here have said, comments are all I need. Commiserating, advice for me or anybody relating to the OP, or a simple upvote to show support is really all I'm looking for.

This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. \n\nHe convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being \u201ccrazy\u201d. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could \u201cfind me easily\u201d. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. \n\nA couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I\u2019m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop.

That's probably also one reason why people who haven't talked to anybody delete their posts.\n\nFor the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.\n\nNow when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much *can't* do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.\n\nWhich is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to.

It happens sometimes at my IRL crisis line, most often because they've never had a supportive conversation before they talked to us, so they kind of \"imprint\" on us (we literally call them \"ducklings\").  It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that \"only X can help me\" and also that \"X has what I need\", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but \"PM me anytime\" does both those things.  \n\n&gt;  There is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.\n\nOne of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people *not* in crisis.  We harm people by *not* disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly \"I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for\".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.",

            "comment": "*Let Me Add My Thoughts with this, I've  must confess I didn't  read the whole post* (or the wiki, wanna check it out later, full focused  in it, I'm  kinda busy rn xp, I promise)  *and I will appreciate  greatly all kinds of feedbacks you all would like to give me. Well, with your permission:\n\nI've suffered depression/been depressed since I was around 10 yo until this year's  February (2019).\n(Major depressive disorder, severe depression, you name it. The first  condition it's only a raw translation from my native language to English, although it may be different as the actual English name, sorry if I've made a mistake)\n\nI don't  want to offend anyone here or make this condition appear to be worse than it really is, but for me, it was Hell. Perhaps I'm  lacking the proper words to describe it but for me it feels/felt like that.\nAround the same age ( I've  started  my toxic relationship with depression) I've  developed anxiety disorder, I'm  still struggling/fighting against that B****.  A nasty combo.\n\nFor some reason unknown, even for myself, in some moment in that time I've started to think about both conditions as females, ladies, nothing against them obviously, they are more beautiful than men,  proved they are more intelligent than men and without the ladies we are just savages, love them all. Xp \n\nNow, as an adult (25 years old, male) I've took a phrase for myself, it says, more or less:\n\n\"Depression is nothing more than a sad lady knocking at our door in a rainy night. Let her in and listen carefully what she has to say, but do not let her stay. Once the rain has stopped, say goodbye to her.\nOtherwise, she *Will* get into every corner of your house( Inner me, mind, etc), and kicking her out it's hard, painful and takes lots of time, wasting life. You don't  have to be rude, though, learn how to treat her, listening her words and advising her are the best way to help her and yourself. Letting her stay and being rude will start  a war between both of you, a nasty one, and in the beginning, she is always stronger than us. \nTakes years to overpower her and acquire control.\n Listen the echoes inside of you, the voice around you and read the words dedicated to you. It may be someone nice trying to be nice with themselves or he/she could be someone struggling too, trying to make you know that there's others with their own wars, some of em had lost some battles, others had won, but all of em are fighting back, see them and learn from them. A few others have lost the will to fight and this lady took their heart, alongside their last breath. I never forget them, it could have been me.\nThere's stairs to heaven, highways to hell and the unlimited potential we all have to evolve, let me tell you my secret ;) :you seek outside the reasons, help, strength or anything you think you need to not give up. You NEED to go and look inside, think about  it. We are amazed by the wonders in the space, maybe because we already forget the beauty of the jewels in the deeps of the planet. That's the hint. \nI'm fool and forget to mention another possibility: if the written words were made for your eyes, the voices for your eyes, or the cheers for your heart, it could be a type of people I admire, respect and decided to become one of them in the future: The friends beyond all the fight. Because you'll find a friend in almost every one of them. And they will be one (or both) of two things: and adviser/helper, like masters, to share with you where they did stumble in their path and suggest useful things.\nOr your friends, doing the same as the first, and even more, much more.\nThey've learned to appreciate anything that shines in the darkness after living there for so long that they don't  want anybody to feel the same, and if you let me include myself with them, we will do such things because we like it, and we mean it. \nI am or I am not. Always. I'm always Too much of anything or absolutely nothing,  There's no mid points to me, I pour my soul in every thing I've decide to do, always help to anyone I can, serve the others and do good recklessly. That's one thing or two I believe in.\nSo, c'mon Bro, grab this hand I didn't had and take the strength I've lacked. Anytime you want, mate. That's why I'm here for.\"\n                                                                                                         The mind of Sun\n\nThat's a little thingy I wrote not so long ago, I've felt it would be nice posting it here,  it's  not the complete thing, it has some holes intentionally, but it's the first 80% of my own writings I've post ever. Hope it doesn't offend anyone, if it do not help you by any means, hopefully don't  hurt anyone either. I like to write, you know, my poison  of choice are poetry and philosophy  (damned poetry \ud83d\ude02),\nAnd if you catch even the tiniest bit of the deep meaning it also have, you already figured it wasn't a cute this half of my life. Lived in the bottom for years, pretended to be fine bc like we all do, I didn't want to worry not even one of my love ones, I was unable to have a treatment with a psychologist or psychoanalyst, and my whole list of sins didn't help much either.\nI've even tried to \"end\" myself  (sorry for this) four times.\nObviously, fortunately, unsuccessfully. \nAfter I've surpassed, the very first day after, for the first time in years, I've  woke up, happy. I don't  remembered the last time it happened. A couple of weeks after I've decided to believe in the things I've mentioned in my poor writing above, among others. And even more in those in the last two lines.\nI didn't had anybody to help me. Support me, freaking avoid I've tried those 4 things.\nI'm not fully recovered, I believe  this lady never really leave, it's always lurking but nice you won her, it's  more hard for her to regain full control. I've decided to always go beyond if I find myself a limit for anything, return anything good people do or give to me 10x  times better, if it was something bad, I'd return them something 100x better, don't  be cruel, don't lose yourself, do not treat people as bad as they are, treat them as good as you are.\n\nMany people here would probably know what cost me to learn these things too. \nThat's why I wanna help and give my full disposition when I've reply something similar.\nRegardless I do like to know all kinds people.\nAlthough I don't think of myself like a hero or anything.\nI'm trying to save pain to people that haven't reach that point, help the ones there, and for all the people struggling I'm  saying: I'm here for you, if you want. Just say the word.\nI don't start a chat, perhaps because I would be acting for my own selfishness at first glance.\nIt's  the way I respect people's desires. \nAlthough, I know how hard it is. \n\n\nTHAT'S IT, I'VE EXTENDED MYSELF QUITE MUCH.\nMY APOLOGIES HOMIES.\nI ASK YOU ALL TO FORGIVE MY GRAMMAR, I'M NOT A NATIVE ENG SPEAKER, LEARNED IT BY MYSELF, STILL POLISHING IT, I'M DOING MY BEST. \nTHE WRITING IT'S OBVIOUSLY PHRASES I'VE READ AND LIKED, MIXED WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS.\nI USE THESE QUOTE TO SYNTHESIZE MY OWN THOUGHTS/WRITINGS.\nI'm still a bit embarrassed for it.\nLet me quote a hero:\n\"Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of and that it can\u2019t degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good\"\n\n\"My relationship to them. That we came into the world for the sake of one another.\"\n      MARCUS AURELIUS \n\nYou are more than you think, stronger than you feel, loved than you believe and unique than you perceive.\nSeek something you like or care about, make it a hobby. And do it relentlessly. \n\nThings like mindfulness, stoicism, a essay/book of a subject you like, even slightly interested in, are helpful too.  Learn more things, do more things.\nOnce you realize what's stopping you, bringing you down, you'll gain power over it and it will get weaker and weaker. \nYou are far more than you think.\nI believe that, soon you'll  do it too.\n\nRegardless the feedback you guys give me, I'm  here.  Keep that in mind.\nWhy not? ;)\n\nGood vibes homies \u270c\u270c\u270c\ud83d\ude0e\nI send you all a Bro hug. \nYou can.\n\nEdit: I gave some format to this text, I'm on a mobile right now, you know Reddit don't care about formatting and stuff.\n2. I'm respecting the rule of no offering pm or smh, this was a last time. It could be helpful too, hard to measure and globalize something too random as the human being. Just saying.\nI'll stick to the rule from now on.",

I've had three definite experiences of this in the past where after a few messages back and fourth, I just want to be left alone and continue. I don't want to remain in private contact but there's no polite way of putting this across to the other person. \n\nPrior to my time on Reddit, there was one particular forum I was a member of who private messaged me for many months. Probably getting on for a year. In the end, I just had to stop replying and inevitably ended up blocking that person when they continued to message me for weeks afterwards - turning quite nasty. \n\nAs my own personal rule, I don't and haven't responded to any private messages for around a year. I don't mean to offend anyone by that but after several 'less than pleasant' experiences and then the expectation to remain in contact thereafter - I've just had to call it a day and say \"*enough's enough*\".

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.\n\nThe crux of the issue I found is, you don\u2019t know who you are helping. You don\u2019t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.\nAs well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don\u2019t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don\u2019t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.\nAs was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.\n\nMy own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.\n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!\n\nBut as I said, you don\u2019t know who you are helping and they don\u2019t know you.\nAnd if you aren\u2019t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.\nAccusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.\n\nTo all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.",

I think we differ greatly under the surface.  \n\nThere are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  \n\nThere are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.\n\nBut I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the \"developed\" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.  \n\n&gt;  I'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.\n\nAre you truly \"negative\"?

So, my private message stated as such &amp; I asked the age of the enquirer. (14 yrs old). I then informed them because of that,  I'd give some of the details, but not all of them.

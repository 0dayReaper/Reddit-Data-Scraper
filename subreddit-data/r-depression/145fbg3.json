    "postText": "I'm 25(F) and got covid depression during my study years. After 2 years of intensive therapy, focusing on myself and medication, I felt like I won over. 9 months ago, I found a job and got back on tracks. \n\nI have the social butterfly type of personnality and exudes self confidence vibes. But since depression, I've felt this dark side of myself sticking and I get intrusive/suicidal thoughts pretty often (several times a week). Sometimes, I even don't know which personnality is the real one anymore. \n\nThis week,  I got a minor inconvenience at work and a co-worker told me \"you disappointed me\" and these words hurt more than they should... it's been three day and my old friend insomnia came back, anxiety makes me think of these petty words all day long and how I am a waste of space/oxygen... I thought that I was cured and it hurts so much to see that nope, I'm still a broken human being, not even able to process words... and that it's going to be a lifetime situation.  \n\nWorse of all, I cried in front of another co-worker at the office and I feel so ashamed because this side of myself is the total opposite of what I've been showing them... I told them I feel like trash and I hate myself so much it hurts... Monday I have to go back to work ashamed, depressed and worse of all, I have to do it all with jokes and a pretty smile because that's what others have been used to.... I only hope this isn't a real relapse but just a \"sad period\". Don't want to get on medication again,  it makes everything so bland. \n\nAnyone there getting harsh ups and down like these ? Or having this weird double-personnality thing ? I just want to know I'm not alone....",

Having to hide your feeling is something that you should not do as they will build and build to the point t you have full breakdown.  \n\nSometimes, I feel like I want to go to work sometimes, and I feel like I don't want to go because I don't have the energy to move or do anything. \n\nBut I've learnt that the small little things make the big things eventually easier to handle. \n\nHope your doing ok. Here if you need.",

Especially in the situation where I am supposed to be the \"goofy\" office friend and actually broke down in front of someone. \n\nI feel like my personality is a lie and people wouldn't love me if they knew that I don't fit the mold of a standard healthy-minded person. \n\nHope you are doing okay as well.",

            "comment": "\"Or having this weird double-personnality thing ? \" I do but I strongly worry hitting rule number 5 and 7 on the sub because the way I deal with it is an unusual way and may sound like I am preaching a self-help strategy. I'd have a lot to say about these two and of course I'd ask more information of yourself as well. In short to not hit the rules and to give a small glimpse at least, I don't see this 'social butterfly' self as the one to be priviliged and the 'dark' self as the one which you should get rid off. Instead of picking which one is the real one (most are going against the 'dark' self, I prefer to use your own words), I see both as real, instead of having a static and unchangeable concept of self - that is, seeing the self as fixed, constant - I have a more dynamic sense of self that includes change and includes both. We don't live on a rainbow paradise of butterflies like one may sound, it is not as if we live on a world where we should be fearless all the time.",

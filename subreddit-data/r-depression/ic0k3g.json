I really find it hard to enjoy what I am doing, but now I am starting to notice little glimpses every couple days (only lasts for a few min to 30min). Makes me somewhat hopeful.\n\nI know it is hard (I still can't some days), but just getting out of bed or your house or even sitting by a window may help. It won't be enjoyable at first, but maybe you'll start to notice tiny little changes over time.\n\nGood luck &lt;3",

(As Tyson Fury would say) \nAnd I don't mean your 9-5 that you hate,find something that you're passionate about, dare to try things, you may think you don't have the time or energy to do anything else but work, video games and sleep, but having this purpose, even if it takes up a lot of time, will give you more energy. \nFor me I want to start making music and getting in shape and I'm terrible at both but when I actually put work into these things my mind is much more at ease, I go from anxious and worthless to calm and purposeful. \nThe hardest part is pushing through the doubts and fears of failure, and just starting, I was there for many years and now Im daring to try. 99.9% of the time the fear is worse in your head, and you'll kick your self for not doing it sooner. \nThings I also recommend are read books, learn to meditate, and try and eat healthier. \nHope this idea can help someone",

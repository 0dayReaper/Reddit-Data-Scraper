    "postText": "\nHello, messaging from an anonymous account but,for the last 4/5 years i\u2019ve amounted to nothing. Since i was 16, nothing has seemed to go my way, i try my best to look hopeful for the future but nothing has changed. im now 19 and my situation hasn\u2019t changed. I can\u2019t work , i can\u2019t bring in funds , i can\u2019t do anything. I had plans for myself to make in my teen years but now i\u2019ve realized that nothing has gone through. compared to my friends at my age who are enjoying life , going on holidays, working and finding there passion and what they want to do in life but me i cant again do anything. I feel like ive wasted my teenage years hoping for something different and better to happen but nothing seemed changed. Those years i\u2019ll never get back. I constantly think about if i left would it be better. Maybe going somewhere where i don\u2019t have to worry no more. Its been like this for 5 years. I constantly remind myself that it would be better if i left. I fall into false promises or lose sleep due to overthinking about my mistakes and failures. But who knows maybe things will change. like they said it\u2019s gets worse before it gets better. told myself that for 5 years. Lies again. My dreams are achieved with the right direction but the starting point can\u2019t be found or achieved. Maybe if i go ghost and delete all my socials and come back when the time is right. I\u2019ve done that before. I want to be left alone. But wheres the fun in that. The only thing which has improved is I\u2019m able to express emotions. However its no use. This may be the one time you hear from me , no use to continue on living when theres no improvements, i go to the gym , play on my playstation but i still ain\u2019t happy, I enjoy time with my friends but thats temporary when they all have hobbies and jobs , i have nothing .just me. I don\u2019t know why i was given this life knowing this is how it\u2019s gonna be. Im so unlucky, the only memories I have are of my past mistakes i\u2019ve made which stick with me. It\u2019s no use. Thank u for reading:)",

    "postText": "(22m) A lot of times I feel like my life is moving in circles rather than moving forward like it should be. Like I keep getting caught in the same patterns and routines over and over and I know I have the power to change my life but I just don\u2019t for some reason. Like I start to make steps in the right direction then I just give up and end up right back at square one. I have such high expectations for myself and I want to achieve great things but I guess I\u2019m just too lazy to actually bring any of my goals to fruition. I\u2019m just tired of making the same mistakes time and time again. I feel like time is passing and my environment is changing but I\u2019m still stuck in the same place I was years ago.",

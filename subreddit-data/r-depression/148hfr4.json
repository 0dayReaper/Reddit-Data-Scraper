    "postText": "I cannot because I cannot inflict that pain on my partner or my family.\n\nSo instead I continue and try to fix what I can.\n\nHowever, I have developed addictions to help myself cope and get through each and every day. So, rather than giving up, I am essentially keeping myself going through my various addictions.\n\nI know it's certainly not the way to be living.\n\nThe funny thing is that despite all of this, I have a great partner and a great job.\n\nIt's just, other than those two positives, nothing seems to be going right. I'm not going to type out my life story here, but I have all sorts of issues that I just haven't recovered from or haven't been able to cope with. And man does it hurt.\n\nI certainly don't want to keep living this way, so the only thing is can do is try to change things and take positive steps in any way I can. And perhaps just take it easy at times and respect my efforts.",

    "postText": "I feel like I have just lived for less than one year, like I was 'sleeping' and woke up just a few months ago.  \n\nMost of the things that happened before, people I met, subjects I passed, I am unable to recall. Names, events, dang even myself, the way I acted, when I see older pictures, or when people tell me about something I did (from about 2 years ago) it is just so foreign to me.\n\nI like to keep a diary for this reason, and that is what is so scary to me, I read it and I can't recognise myself, I was so different. Last year, I tried to kms 4 times, and ended up in a psych yard for about six months, I remember nothing but the horrible week after cutting on my medication.\n\nNowadays I'm at my lowest since last year, left my job without any other plans because of my memory problems and anxiety and whatnot. Feeling like garbage for about 10 years now, I know because my journals are filled with the same hate talk. I'm so tired. \n\nPlease tell have you experienced something similar? Is it just the depression??",

    "postText": "I finally did it guys!!!!! 2 years!! \n\nI was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without.\n\nI spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. \n\nBut I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.\n\nEdit: I cant believe how many people replied to this!! Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester. \n\nAlso to all the people who said this post gave them a little kick in the ass to go back, were all going to do amazing :)",

I failed a few of the classes because i couldn't keep up on top of working as well to pay for gas and partially tuition. It made my anxiety and depression skyrocket and the stress of it made my meds stop working. I'm going to take it slow this time. I'm sick of feeling like I ruined my life and I'm finally doing something about it :)",

I just got enrolled again and I've been trying to talk to everyone I can about how to make things better. I'm at 70 units attempted and 28 completed sitting at 1.46 GPA With a ton of F's for classes I just gave up on for not wanting to try. \n\nThere's three options to get around that. \n\nCourse Alleviation if you progress enough in a new degree they'll remove the F's. Talk to a counselor for more information or Google your college. May take a couple semesters.\n\nAppeal Financial aid. Not sure how it is for other colleges but I assume similar standards. Talk to a counselor to get a Student Education Plan (SEP), enroll in your classes and bring proof, and write a statement for why you have your status appealed. I'm attempting this now just waiting on college to show I'm enrolled (it's a certificate you can't openly apply for so there's a delay I'm told by the administrator who accepted me into it will show soon). After you submit it there's a response in about 4 weeks. Also financial aid is appealable if you want to try after 90 units attempted. Good if you're close to a degree but would like extra support.\n\nApply for services with the disabled department. I know some have pride in asking or acknowledging what difficulties they have but a mental health professional or doctor can assess you, or if you've been assessed and believe you can use that, then there's paperwork you can give to them to get accepted. I'm told they can remove F's too. I've never been adequately assessed but I've talked to my therapist about getting me evaluated.\n\nI wish you all the best, if you're going to struggle might as well struggle in a better direction.",

It's wonderful that you have a supportive boyfriend who is always there to encourage you :) but also, don't forget to turn to yourself and see that you have an enormous strength that is always encouraging you as well.\n\nCongrats OP, keep at it!",

I mean even today, I'm getting alot of anxiety about going back. \n\nI have a few things that have helped. I've completely stopped drinking coffee, I've been drinking it since 14 and that's around the time I started having panic attacks. So barely any caffeine now. I watch alot of TV, tv is a huge stress reliever for me, if theres something stressing me out, I watch tv to distract myself. If you do this just be wary it can be detrimental if you start procrastinating too much, it can very easily turn into a cycle.\n\nMy biggest thing is meds. My doctor put me on zoloft. I have some side effects but nothing too extreme, for the most part it's working really well. If you are struggling with anxiety, I swear to you, meds help. You can get them from your GP or your gyno if you're a girl, you dont need an expensive psychiatrist to give you meds.",

I've had the same experience, dropped out of college within a year after my high school diploma, and struggled for over two years working my way through my mental issues - which were at the time undiagnosed - and a deep sense of bewilderment. After those couple years I managed to get back to college, though my mental issues were only starting to torment me and though I was years away from getting diagnosed. So all along I thought the only issue was me - just me, and not some illness that I have no control over. So you're lucky to be aware of your condition ! I ended up going all the way to the Master's degree, when I at the time only could picture myself getting to the Bachelor's and nowhere beyond. The way was paved with discouragement, thoughts of giving up because sticking to a plan and to any type of schedule was beyond me, but I surprised myself making it in spite of my huge lack of willpower, energy, and regardless of the countless classes (and even semesters) I had skipped... \nSo big round of applause to you and I hope that you will hang on when the discouragement will come !",

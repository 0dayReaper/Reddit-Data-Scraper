Blame where blame is due; someone you look up to, someone who is supposed to care for you and love you and validate you when appropriate has messed with your emotions OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME. She is definitely at least partly implicit in your psychological struggles. Don\u2019t tell her because she\u2019s exactly the sort of bitch who would deny it and get mad, and you really don\u2019t need any more put-downs. And stop adoring her so much.

What your family did was wrong, they and you shouldnt compare you to others in that way, I'm reminded of a podcast episode I listened to recently, \"On Purpose with Jay Shetty, 7 ways to stop comparing yourself to others,\" I think it might help you.

Try to remember there are no (good) books on how to be a parent. They are trying, I promise. Every parent is trying; some more than others but you get the idea.  \n\nIf I could offer anything, I would say use your friends online. People like us tend to not have a lot of close personal friends as much as we have our friends online. Hell, I'm almost 50 and I only have two friends that don't live in the internet.  Anyways, we tend to be far less judgemental (aside from the ever-present trolls and they just don't matter), empathetic, and we understand the criticality of just listening and letting someone talk through their feelings without someone else trying to \"help.\" \n\nYou are not alone. You don't know me and I don't know you but if I can help I will be happy to do so. Parents will love you forever but they are not the best at listening to their children. Oh, and try not to be preoccupied about crying in front of them. There is nothing to be ashamed of. \"Anyone who tells you otherwise is seeking something.\"\n\nRed",

Sucks they dont educate themselves, but it is what it is. They love you I'm sure. My dad listens and gives me advice comparing his mental health being unstable for a long time but just words it weird. I see now thats his way of trying to comfort me. Lol",

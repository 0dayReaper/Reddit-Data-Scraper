    "postText": "I eat whenever I get depressed or anxious. For the past year, I held a consistent diet and went from 170lbs to 125lbs. Having a full time job helped. \n\nThe problem now is my last day at work was thursday. I am moving soon. Add moving stress plus not having a consistent routine, I fucked my diet. I bought snacks and started eating/drinking around the clock again due to stress and overall depression tendencies. Today I consumed all the food in my proximity. I now weigh 138lbs. \n\nI gained 13lbs in 3 days. \n\nNow I gotta go back to not eating and having my water bottle in my mouth like a damn pacifier. Why can't I control myself?!",

I don\u2019t necessarily want to cut everyone out of my life but one third are dysfunctional/toxic and the reason I\u2019m depressed, the other third don\u2019t know how to handle dealing with someone who has depression, and the rest are carefully selected friends that are there for me no matter how long I withdraw/isolate myself from them. Believe me, those suffering from depression are VERY aware of the inevitability of being alone when shit hits the fan - in fact, that\u2019s the reason we distance ourselves from people - we don\u2019t want to be a burden and the sickness in our head lies to us and tells us we\u2019re unlovable. So we distance ourselves and the shitty cycle continues. \n\nYour comment is so incredibly insensitive and unhelpful in a subreddit such as this. Also did you even see the /s tag in my comment? Smh",

What I will say is a lot of people make suicide a priority because sadly you can't fix someone's depression problem if they're gone. People may not understand why you feel suicidal, but people do recognize that you're in pain, and that is a universal human emotion that everyone can have empathy for if they choose to. There are people who even if they don't understand why you feel the way you do, they do empathize with the pain you feel and want to help you heal from it. I'm sorry you feel like this though, it can sometimes feel like no one really understands exactly how you feel, but they do recognize that you feel hurt and want to help you. I hope you feel better.",

Consider buying the sequel to it. And good luck to all of you \ud83d\ude09",

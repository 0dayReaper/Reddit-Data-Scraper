    "postText": "This morbid content sits on a scale, ranging from reading about natural/manmade disasters to graphic video content. I'm a bit ashamed of this but feel I need to speak about it. \n\nI find some relief or catharsis in watching/reading about this subject matter, yet at the same time know I'm scarring myself mentally. I often regret it later on, when I recall it. \n\nDoes anyone else experience this? What impact does it have on you? How do you manage it? Is this a sign of something worse?\n\nFor context, I suffer from melancholic depression and am on medication for it (Sertraline/Zoloft).",

But I keep watching, maybe because I feel like I deserve it or because it's somehow confirmation that I'm capable of feeling things other than despair and sadness. I've watched truly gruesome videos and visted horrible websites, and this post made me consider the effect it has on my psyche more.",

I haven\u2019t correlated it to doing it when I\u2019m really low. Actually, the last year or so I noticed if I am at a low it\u2019ll make me feel worse so I try not to watch it then.  If I\u2019m not in the lows of my depression it doesn\u2019t seem to affect me abnormally and I carry on my morbid fascination.",

Even TV shows entertain putting graphic content or crime fiction within stories.\n\nIn honesty, reading how you're afraid that this could be mentally scarring probably means you're self-aware enough to understand the seriousness of things like that, meaning you have a conscience.\n\nI would even consider a show like The Walking Dead to be graphic content, though that doesn't mean everyone who watches or is entertained by that type of show are bad people\n\nI do agree that what you surround yourself with can affect your own mental health. So only watching graphic content is probably not the best or the healthiest. However overall no, I don't think that means something is necessarily wrong.\n\nAs long as it's not conspiracy theories or something radical, then you're good.",

            "comment": "this is something I've done for years in repeating cycles when my depression is its worst. its always disaster videos, subreddits or podcasts. specifically, I tend to rewatch/revisit stuff like chernobyl, the ache tsunami, historical floods and fires, documentaries on nanking, the Holodomor, everest ventures/failures or arctic explorations, plane crashes (reddit's admiral cloudberg's medium has kept me going for years \\[[https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/)\\]), shipwrecks, catastrophes and whatever videos or documentaries or articles I can find online about these subjects. its not something I tell people about because its very morbid and disturbing. I've found that its been a very potent catharsis for me - not that I hurt myself mentally the way people who cut or otherwise hurt themselves do - but it reminds me that in the most dismal, horrific, ultimately tragic moments we experience as human beings, there is life worth living after the fact. it does help me to come back around and remind myself of simple appreciation and deep gratitude for the smallest joys in my life, and to enjoy them while I can. as my depression has improved (through medication, therapy, interpersonal relationships, support, changing detrimental circumstances and mindfulness), I've done this less and less, but I still remember and remind myself why I've done it, that it was all to cope with what was my own pscyho-emotional trauma.",

Like if you see an animal being eaten alive in the wild, all of sudden your issues don't seem so bad because it's like, \"well it could be a lot worse.\"",

Usually, people who enjoy more morbid content tend to feel comforted by gruesome content because of the the heavy subject material. This is due to people who experience a lot of unpleasant, uncomfortable feelings more often than good ones, we are used to bad feelings and thoughts. So watching something that mirrors that is in our comfort zone. It isn't comfortable to watch something happy, when you feel shitty. It's comfortable to revel in unhappiness and sink into it.",

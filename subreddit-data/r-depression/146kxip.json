    "postText": "I rarely ever post on Reddit, I usually like to read rather than express myself but this is something I\u2019d like to hear more from other people if they\u2019ve ever experienced it. I saw a similar thread posted awhile back so at least I know I\u2019m not the only one. \n\nBut anyways, I want to start off by saying I\u2019m not diagnosed with any mental illness, and although I\u2019ve been interested in the process, I am unable to do so out of fear of my family (but that\u2019s another can of worms for another day). \n\nWhenever I experience any sort of situation or circumstance that throws me off of my expectations or routine for the day, I feel absolute dread and have thoughts of harming myself, suicide, ETC. Especially when it comes to anything pertaining to my family and the drama that we have (again, very long story). So basically, what I would like to know is, does anyone else have that same switch? When something goes wrong, you immediately feel the need to punish yourself or react negatively? \n\nI don\u2019t know, I hope I\u2019m making sense. This is really just a vent for me as well. Today was going really well until it wasn\u2019t and I don\u2019t want to bother the very few friends I have. So, please, bear with my sporadic thoughts, strangers. \n\nMuch love. :)",

There are a lot of factors that contribute to the way I tend to react and think about situations as they unfold, and I know that it can be a bit *much*, but it\u2019s something I can\u2019t help and I wish I could figure out a way to not treat myself the way I do. \n\nIt does help to hear what other people have to say though, including your words as well. Thank you! :)",

Just focus your mind on the breath. \n\nDrink some water and try again. \n\nIn a few mins you will calm down.",

I wanted nothing more than to lock up the store and cry in the back, but obviously I wasn\u2019t trying to lose my job \ud83d\ude2d \n\nI did do some grounding techniques to keep my composure for the remainder of my shift and it worked out for the most part.",

    "postText": "I just don't see it happening. I just see things, at best, becoming more manageable. Even if I got everything I've ever wanted right now, I don't think it'd be enough. The damage from isolation, loneliness, and anxiety has gone on for too long. I have daily panic attacks and I am struggling to function in society. I'm forced to be around people I can't relate to and who make me feel more alone and misunderstood than I already am. I just can't take this shit anymore.\n\nWhat if I got a new job? I get rapidly burned out just doing basic things, so unless it accommodates that, I'm fucked.\n\nMake new friends and/or find a partner? Probably won't be able to relate/connect to them, and my social issues would probably make me isolate a lot and not open up/talk to them about things. Assuming I could even find friends/a partner to begin with, which, based on my track record, isn't likely. And even if I did find them, what are the chances they'd actually want to be around/with me?\n\nTravel/get out and about? Unless I can get my driver's license (I hate driving) and a decent amount of money, this is unlikely. This also partially ties into my point about getting a job.\n\nI truly feel alone in this world. No one's coming to help me, and I can barely help myself. What's the point?",

            "comment": "I feel that. I'm 49 now and have depressive episodes since I'm 12 or so. I seek and accept help for about 15 years now. A lot of medications a few therapies. Before I searched for help in form of humans I learnd a lot trough books and then internet. I grew up in a time, when there are not depressed people, we are just called lazy and became mobbed for don't function so well. There are years, I had about two good month and the other ten month are depressive episodes. And some years, there are up to 8 good month. But there are no years without depression. If I had a relationship or not, a job or not, I'm healthy or not, I'm fat or not, I make sports or not, I eat healthy or not, I'm much time in nature or not. Depression comes, depression goes for a short amount of time. Even if I take medicine or not, go to therapy or not, this f*ing metal illnes is allways on my side.\nI'm autistic, too, so I now know, what's one thing that causes depression. But does it go away? No.\nWhat I've learned about depressive episodes is, that they really fuck your mind and they give you the belive, that what you think is you, is right, is and was allways bad. That's wrong. But in this episodes it doesn't matter, that I know my thoughts aren't healthy, aren't true. They are to strong.\nSo I decided, not to think, when I'm depressed, not believe my thoughts, just watch them. That's hard enough. To not make it worse by thinking is hard enough.\nWith getting old slightly something changes. On one hand I'm more afraid of dying alone. Because of this depressions I have no partner, no kids, no family, no pets and I'm getting fat, because I'm this sort of depressed who eats a lot to bare this agonie. I think, no one ever will love me, no one ever will hug me in love. I have no car, can't drive, no money, can't do great things, no house, rent bleeds me out, no job. The things I loved to do don't work for me anymore.\nBut on the other hand, very little things make me more happy. Birds picking food near my windows, fresh weather, such things. And yes, there is much less time left to live, what's a very good thing, I think. I don't have to fit in and step by step can see the beauty sides of became fat and ugly. You get no love, okay, but also there are less idiots on my ways. Humans are more an other species like, hm, dogs or cats. You don't have to be pretty or a well functioning one to like a dog or a cat.\nDo I wish it was not this hard and sad? Yes. Does it make any better, when I'm sad about that? No. Sorry, I don't know, what I wanted to say.",

My cousin who was 40 years old with various mental illnesses and extreme anxiety, passed away like 2-3 days ago after cardiac arrest. The autopsy will show if it was a cardiac arrest or he mixed a bunch of drugs as he was a user of light drugs, heavy alcohol user, and a bunch of meds prescribed by his psychiatrist. Existing is hell. We're thrown in this planet to suffer. I trully believe that. They put our energy/soul in these human shells to suffer. Even our brain doesn't allow us to end our miserous existence due to survival instict.\n\n31yo here, virgin, no friends. GAD, depression, and severe social anxiety. Even if I didn't have depression, my life would resemble a life of a depressed person when you suffer from mental illnesses.

What\u2019s not ok is knowing that depressive pits will appear in the road so deciding not to travel. You can\u2019t rely on others to fix your problems but you can make hay when the sunshine\u2019s to make depressive episodes as easy as possible. This might not be useful right now if you\u2019re already in the pit but in the future in the not so bleak times fill your freezer with things you can Chuck in the oven when times are bad. Put away clothes in ziplocks as outfits or just have a simple shirt, underwear, trousers set up so on bad days getting dressed is easier. Work out what your non negotiables are in terms of personal and home hygiene on the really bad days maybe you resort to telling yourself you only have to wash one plate or put toothpaste on the brush, but 9 times out of 10 that initial step spurs the next one. Keep in touch with professionals in the good times so it\u2019s less difficult to make appointments when things are shit. Doing all these little things can add up to big change. Surround yourself with people who understand there will be rough patches, often these are people who have been there in your good times you help them, in theirs they can help you and every so often you will get a day where you\u2019re both good and that depressive humour makes a standard day off the greatest experience and it will make it all worthwhile. There are things we can do to make a depressed life better than it otherwise would be. \n\nP.S get out into nature I don\u2019t know why but even walking barefoot in the back garden makes a difference to the way I handle the day.",

The problem is thinking.\n\nDepression is just a mental condition which can be rectified for sure if you are willing to come out of it. No one is born with such thinking patterns. We adopt these patterns either from our parents, family, friends, neighbours, relative or social media.\n\nIf you are ready to change your thinking pattern, for sure you will be out of depression. In fact, you are not in depression at all. These are not [symptoms of depression](https://www.yahalife.com/post/21-symptoms-of-depression-and-how-to-reduce-it).\n\nBuddy if you cannot trust your own self you wont be able to trust anyone on this planet. If anyone will give any advise or suggestion you will have a counter for it because right now you are operating from high logical thinking pattern. So even if someone will come to help, you wont take it.\n\nIf someone will give you one logic you will counter that logic with another. So I am not going to give you any advise or suggestion. The day you will come out of this thinking pattern you will be much better.\n\nThere are 6 types of thinking styles and right now you are stuck with only critical thinking style so everything will be negative for you. So when you will shift your thinking style you will be able to see better options.\n\nI am sure right now you don't see any point but as soon as you will shift your thinking style you will be able to see many points. You are a creative person I could feel that. Right now you may be going through creative block which is fine.\n\nEveryone goes though it in life. As far as you are here on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression) I dont think you are alone at all. This entire community is here with you. The question is are you ready to receive the help and change your own thinking patterns?\n\nSending you energies of clarity.",

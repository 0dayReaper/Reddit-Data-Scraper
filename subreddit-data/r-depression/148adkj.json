    "postText": "Growing up, I have never really thought much of my mental health, and \"gathered\" loads of trauma over the years. Only recently did I feel the impact of what it was like.\nWhen I was younger, I was able to live happily and enjoyed my life a lot. I believed I had really loving parents, other than some times when they were a little violent.\nI developed many issues over the years. Trust issues, especially. I developed it mainly because of my sister and my first domestic helper.\nI'll list a couple things that had made me the sad and frightened person today:\n1. I watched a pig get killed when I was around 5. It was quite horrible. There was blood all over the floor. The action of slicing off the head wasn't done properly, so it was in a lot of pain.\n2. Forced to watch a horror movie when I was around 6. Had nightmares for 3 years afterwards.\n3. Watching my grandparents and mother fight for a couple hours straight when I was around 5/6. I never saw my grandparents ever again because of their fight. I was then forced to make a decision of whether I will follow my grandparents or my parents. It made me develop some anxiety(which I actually didn't realize at that time)\n4. I nearly drowned to death after I tripped into the pool when I was 5 and all my parents did was laugh.\n\nThese are just some examples. Other examples would include my mother strangling my pet parrot to death, my physical abuse from my sister, the constant screaming and crying around the house, the trauma I got from sailing because I was crushed under a boat that was 2 times heavier than I was etc. I can't list everything or else this would never end.\n\nTo be very honest, I would believe I am a rather forgiving person. I always forgave my sister for whatever she did to me. She was probably just in pain as well.\n\nBut,  at one point in time, I just felt like everything piled up to me, and it just feels so suffocating. I start seeing hallucinations at one point in time.\nI started to fear my sister. I can't stop shaking every time I see her. I can't even breathe properly from time to time. I tried commiting suicide a few times, but it didn't work. I started freaking out at one point and I had a hard time calming down.\n\nMy family and I are on a vacation right now, so I really want to get closer to them, but my fear of them have really grown to the extent that I even fear going near them. I feel like I'm just being working rn, lol.\n\nI'm not really sure whether this is the right place to post this, so please do tell me if it isn't, I'll take it off immediately.\n\nCould someone give me some advice on what I should do?",

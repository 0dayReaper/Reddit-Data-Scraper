    "postText": "I have struggled with anxiety and depression for quiet some time. Progressively it has become more significant. Summers also always get 10 times worse. \n\nDuring summer our visitation with my kiddo and her dad switches. We go from her being with me all week and every other weekend to me only seeing her every other weekend. This year the way Labor Day and when summer visitation started both of those ended on my weekends so he\u2019s going to have had her for 5 weekends in a row and it\u2019s now the summer schedule. I STRUGGLE. I don\u2019t even do well on the only every other weekend. Her and I literally do everything together. She\u2019s gone and I attempt to force myself out of the house but this last weekend I just couldn\u2019t. I was up a total of 6 hours between Saturday and Sunday. My nephew was also in a farming accident last Tuesday that has set me off and my grandfathers dementia is really progressing. He is my father figure so seeing him this way and knowing he won\u2019t be around for too much longer is killing me. \n\nI called today and they upped my meds by 75mg but this is the worst I\u2019ve ever been. It\u2019s honestly the worst and scariest thing. It\u2019s like your own personal hell. Crying 24/7. I feel it in my body physically can can\u2019t explain it: my brain my body my chest. \n\nNo one in my family really gets it because they don\u2019t deal with this. I just wish I could be \u201cnormal\u201d like them and not have to deal with this every single day.",

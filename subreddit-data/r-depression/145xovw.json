My edepression is getting worse, as temperature starts to raise to summer temps, so does my depression, its elevating steadily as we get into the summer. Can't wait for fall and winter to get under the blankets and quiet my mind from the constant racing thoughts - which in summer, we have plenty of time to think of our miserous lives.\n\nI think this kind of depressive episode is because we think \"hey, it's summer! We can hang out all day, go to the sea for swimming, clubbing till morning etc etc\". I mean, we are supposed to do things outside in the \"good\" weather, the never ending day and instead, like in my case I rot at home.\n\nGoing out in the summer - I get back to home depressed. Everybody seems to enjoy so much summer and I thought I was the only one that loves winter and doesnt get that depressed compared to summer. Don't get me wrong, im fkin depressed and the winter, it's just that the mental pain is unbearable in the summer, including the old house I live that is like an oven and I hate so so much sweating. Im jealous of pets that sweat only from their paws or sth.",

I live in a village in EU by the sea and ... there are just a lot of animals in villages. Stray or not. Especially if there are big trees everywhere, it's full of these birds but they have built nests in the roof of my house and those little bstrds are like they have been put there to make my life difficut and suffer while trying to sleep. Same thing with curtain. Also there's a grocery store next to my house, and from 08:00am to 13:00pm every kind of supplier truck comes and goes, and 100s of cars stop to take cigs and stuff they need. The house is old and it's like the window is open.\n\nIn the summer, I have to close the window, and have to get used to the fan white noise. This takes 1-3 days and then can sleep easily while the air helps me sleep. No way I can sleep with the window open :/ and it was such a conveniece to put the fan to the window to bring cold night air inside my room as the A/C unit is in other place of the house.",

Better rot in front of the TV and some day, I will find the courage to do things without the need to drag myself or get annoyed from all the happy normies out there. Chores though have to be done no matter how painful they are. I just don't enjoy anything, winter makes it just more tolerable.\n\nI can't even drink a fkin coffee or whatever contains caffeine to take a small boost of dopamine and energy because I have suffered 3  non-epileptic grand mal seizures from stopping benzos abruptly and my neurologist told me no caffeine for life from now on, no matter you're non epileptic. Before those seizures, I was drinking coffee now and then, and could feel the caffeine hitting hard and motivate me and give me the energy no matter being depressed, to go and do some simple tasks. Every morning I wake up anxious and in full dread with zero energy.",

I'm also much more at peace when it's darker and quieter outside and summer robs me of some of that.\n\nI honestly think most people associate summer with happiness because it traces back to their childhood when summer meant being out of school for months and associated fun activities. However, as an adult you're now working most, if not all, of the summer, so I don't get the appeal of 100 degree temperatures, humidity, sweating, sunburns, allergens, bigger crowds, more traffic, bugs being out all over the place, etc. etc. at all.",

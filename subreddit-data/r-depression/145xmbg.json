I always go back to the same ones but the one that I always think about is just not eating or drinking anything and then dying. \n\nI just hope that I die soon I shouldn\u2019t be here I don\u2019t belong I never did and I never will.",

            "comment": "First of all there is no shame in having these thoughts. It is a natural response to a life of pain that you don\u2019t know how to get out of. If you knew how to get out of it easily you would have already. I have these thoughts too even though my overall plan is to live because if I can get a better life, I want it. As I slowly dig myself out it\u2019s comforting to know that I have a backup plan if things never get better. Sometimes I just give up on healing for the night and plan to figure out how to do it tomorrow. In the meantime, might as well do whatever can give me a little fun for my last night. Usually I either wake up feeling better enough to keep healing or too lazy to actually do it. But it\u2019s really hard and we\u2019re not meant to face it alone. You deserve to have comfort and help as you heal and I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not getting it. When your brain offers death as the solution to every problem, it is insanely complicated to do anything that you don\u2019t want to do to dig yourself out or keep yourself alive. You\u2019re doing awesome by just being here and taking care of your cat. I hope you have the kind of moment that reminds you of the good parts of life soon.",

You may feel alone in these new places, but it can be amusing watching the odd things humans do",

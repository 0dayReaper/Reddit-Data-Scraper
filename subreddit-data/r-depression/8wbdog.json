It feels good briefly, because depression steels the energy that you should being using to care for yourself. It feels good sleeping all day when your depressed, but that good feeling is quickly replaced with self loathing, loneliness, and helplessness. Going down that path is tempting, because it seams easy and living with depression is hard. But once you go down that path, you'll realize that your depression tricked you into it so it can steel more from you, and your more helpless than before.",

So when I get to the \"greener\" grass on the other side, and it doesn't fix me, I say, oh well that must not be what I needed, but now *this* other thing will make me happy instead. Thus perpetuating this cycle. It's our minds smoke and mirrors way of distracting us from the real sources of our suffering, because those things may feel too painful, shameful &amp;/or just downright too terrifying to face. ",

I suppose for me, I feel like I don't have the freedom to really dig into these things and work on them. Because I have too much on my plate as it is and I can't afford to fall apart in the way that I fear I will. But lately, I'm questioning this: maybe it's just my mind lying to me; or maybe what's on my plate wouldn't feel like such a burden if I actually got some healing. It's hard to say. But my life has become a vicious cycle of wanting, getting, then being unhappy with what I got and wanting something else.

I don't know if it's because I don't think I deserve it or not, haven't figured the reason out yet but whenever I have stability in my life (job, good friends, etc.) I get more depressed and try to sabotage it all. And the foggy mind seems to always come with it but I think that helps me cope a bit.",

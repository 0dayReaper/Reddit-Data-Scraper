    "postText": "I'm 33 and have only ever known suffering and loss in this life. Larger than life ambitions- or, rather, delusions of grandeur?- kept me afloat throughout my late-teens and all through my 20's, but I was too lazy and arrogant to realize any of them, thinking they'd always be there waiting for me right around the corner whenever I decided to \"go for it\". Of course that wasn't the case. Instead, navigating life has been much akin to navigating an asteroid field in space, or a mine field here on earth- except that I haven't gotten by unscathed, without taking significant damage; my mind and body are chock-full of reminders of the countless, continuous, hardships I've incurred. I am so exhausted of striving for a better life- I have tried so hard for so long and gotten nowhere, and just feel beat down, and at the bottom of a bottomless pit, impossible to escape from. A great deal of my problems are financial, as with many people... those are the biggest issues currently plaguing me... but there's so many, technically more serious, other issues... just that in todays world, the financial ones always are prioritized, since otherwise you end up with a home, without a means to communicate, without food on the table... It sucks, but that's the reality. All of those old dreams and ambitions have totally died off now, and I'm just left with bitterness and striving for a means to survive, hoping not to end up homeless. The old me has died. That kid who used to have that glimmer in his eye, that extra bounce in his step, that constant enthusiastic hopeful grin... he's dead. Now left is just a bitter, scornful, middle-aged nobody who's never achieved even just a modicum of all that he meant to. Nothing to show for my three-plus decades on the planet. We're not judged by our character, our good deeds, our talents... What little of old me is left is disgusted by the shift to the new me, but he doesn't know how necessary it is to be this way. I'm sorry, kid- I didn't want it to be like this either, but the pressures of the real world made us cave... we put up a hell of a fight and tried to resist, to live in our own make-believe dream world, for as long as possible... but the weight of real life made that all crumble. Now I'm just a 33 year old loser, no school, no job, surrounded by friends, all of whom are profoundly successful in life- I feel like an imposter around them, not deserving of their friendship. I'm so deeply proud of them, happy for them, to the point I want to disappear from their lives, so that I'm not a black stain on their existence- no matter what they tell me, I know that's all I am to them, And I'll admit, no matter how happy I am for them, deep down inside (I'm very good at hiding it), a combination of sheer jealous and inadequacy eats away at me. They're affording $200,000 cars, $2 million homes, fancy expensive dinners, and so on. I know, comparison is the thief of joy... well, yeah, it really is... but I'd feel as inadequate even if I didn't have them in my life. I can barely make my monthly car payment, and am behind on countless others, with no light on the horizon not only insofar as how I'll ever get out of all this debt, but how ever will I build something of my own- get a home of my own, a family of my own... I don't know where I went wrong... that's a lie, I know exactly where, but I haven't the time machine required to right it. So often I fantasize about driving into oncoming traffic... so often I dream of how beautiful the eternal slumber would be- a retreat from the constant struggle (I've only touched on the monetary, but the reality is that there's much worse plaguing my life)... I have seen a few glimpses of beauty in my 30+ years, and for a while they were enough to keep me going, but now it all seems so fucking hopeless, genuinely; definitively. I will never escape this, I know it- and I don't have the strength or will to go on like this; I'm just so exhausted from it all. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live (like this).",

I live in a poor country and I don't know a single successful person. Believe me, this is a lucky situation. Btw don't feel yourself less than them, it's never only about material success in life. Society lets us think differently but I don't believe it, and in any case let them decide if you are worthy or not, not you.",

    "postText": "My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.\n\nIt's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.\n\n When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. \n\nSorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.\n\nedit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling. I wish you all luck in getting better.",

I\u2019m a shy, introverted person to begin with, but anxiety and depression has really just killed any semblance of personality. Unfortunately I turn to drinking to get myself out of my bubble. Whenever I hang out with my friends I usually just sit there and don\u2019t say much.",

I've gone from spending almost nothing on booze to so much every week.

That sucks the most.\n\n\nI've kinda also found that coffee seems to work too. Except, too much coffee makes you super jittery and the eventual crash is a bit hard to deal with.",

These 20 years don't include the 10 years that I've already spent working on (sometimes against) myself. I still have 17 left, and while I can definitely see an improvement over the past decade, I feel like im nowhere close to being done. And I don't feel any closer to feeling \"better\". I feel more lost than ever. I am sure this phase will pass and be replaced by different phases and feelings. I've gone though deep deep sadness to hopelessness to anger (so much anger).. the anger has faded a bit, which is nice although I gotta say, I kinda liked my anger phase. Hate is an interesting feeling. Fuck, I'm rambling. ",

The worst thing i could have done was get back on it in November after a pregnancy/miscarriage/mental breakdown. I was already fully withdrawn from citalopram and after my breakdown i convinced myself i needed the medication, this second time around getting on it made me aggressive and made all my symptoms so much worse. I related to your post when i read \"hating, envious &amp; bitter\" throw vindictive into that as well. \ud83d\ude14 \nOnce i got on 40mg all i was doing was sleeping, talk about being fully tranquilized. So i decided to stop the meds cold turkey once again... I feel like I've ruined whatever decent qualities I had since depression and i find myself to be even more apologetic now than ever. I praise everyone so much to the point that its like... Are you just kissing ass? But no! I dont ever want anyone to feel like the pos that i feel i am. But with that being said im also the loneliest and furthest away from everyone that ive ever been. \n\nIts only been a couple days since ive been off the med cold turkey and going through a break up simultaneously. This is going to be such a challenge but im ready to get my life back. Im ready for the clarity and to be reborn into something wonderful. Im leaving to Tennessee may 2nd and i really hope i can learn to love myself and just figure out who i am. Im so insecure rn too going from 145lbs to 115lbs in a matter of 2 months, then down to 105lbs from sheer stress. I have this new body and same ugly brain... Its so confusing. Depression stole so much from me \ud83d\ude14 \n\nThanks for shedding some hope on this lost girl. \u2764",

When my depression hit as a teenager, and I saw a lot of things slowly crumble apart in front of my eyes. I just started to lose trust and faith in people which made my depression and social anxiety a whole lot worst.\n\nNow, thanks to a middle school friend that I reconnected with and a few other friends. I've  slightly become the same person that I was a few years ago, if not better. I'm continuing to grow, and learn in the harsh process of life, and that's where a lot of people tend to give up. When they stop seeing the world in a different light. They stop believing in the \"things will get better\" quotes and just hate everyone and everything. I've been there, and I know that feeling that nothing will get better. Suicide, and everything comes back into my mind. I told the same friend yesterday, that I was going to commit suicide back in February. One of the hardest things to tell someone you know, and I'm pretty open to it with strangers.\n\nYou may feel like you're dead inside, you may feel like a monotone and flat person, but you can change. It's all a matter of finding that right support, reminding yourself to stay grounded, and remember who you are and continue to grow as a person. Life isn't easy, and stack depression on top of that. It's a storm ready to come to shore. Honestly, I've realized that living with depression, it's all about trying to keep it in check and fight against it. It's hard I know, I've been battling with it for 8 years now, and I've finally started to really change, and see everything differently. \n\nWe're all strangers here, but we all understand  the struggles in one sense or another. I can just hope that you can get through that struggle of not seeing yourself as who you really are. Peace and one love, have a good day.",

I went for an interview for a master thesis that I was really passionate about. At the interview I was super confident and I think i had a fantastic interview. I got accepted. The first two weeks I had the same energy and then after that something just changed in me. I'm bipolar so I guess this is one of those \"Oh fuck, not this again\" moods.   \nAs the weeks went by I just don't find myself being that confident or passionate. The lab I work with involves a lot of interactions between different people here to get different perspectives, ideas etc but here I am, 10 weeks into this 20 week thesis, afraid and not confident to talk to anyone, not confident to speak up or voice my opinion. I just wanna do my work here and head home. I was hoping I could push this to do my PhD here int this division. I have a month to finish the Phd application but I have no confidence in doing that either. I feel like I haven't created a good impression here and I have fucked it up real bad to do something with my life. I don't know who I am anymore.",

You are not afraid of your neighbour (hopefully) as they are familiar. Every time you interact with someone throughout the day at a store or drive thru or literally anywhere, just try as hard as possible to see them as your neighbour and make small talk. Keep making an EFFORT (capitalized because I struggle with effort so idk maybe others do to) to do this and you'll eventually be making casual conversation with people for very short periods of time throughout the day with no risk to yourself that can trigger anxiety.

I seen family this weekend that I barely see once a year, no one knows my feelings of depression and social anxiety so everyone took me as boring, lonesome and \u2018taking his passing unreasonably hard\u2019 \nIt was not the time nor the place to have any sort of conversation about MY feelings (I don\u2019t like to talk about them and I push them aside most times) \nUnfortunately, ALS takes you physically. Your mind is still sharp as it was before ALS. It takes your ability to walk,eat,speak. It takes away all of your independence, but most of it is painful. \nDepression (for me) has taken away many things from me and countless others, it may not take away my ability to eat, walk or speak (what little I do) but mixed with anxiety, It\u2019s a whole other level. I do have hope that one day I will be able to return back to who I am, who I remember I am but the outlook doesn\u2019t look good. ",

So we feel exactly the same way as you do.  But you\u2019re right, if you\u2019re one of the luckier bipolar folks, it can be interrupted by moments of happiness or even calm transitionary periods.  The shell effect continues though.  Regardless of the period you\u2019re in.\n\nAll mental illnesses have their challenges.  Bipolar is arguably worse than having only depression........  But, it\u2019s not a competition and it\u2019s unique to every individual as well.  \n\nJust keep going.  That\u2019s all that people like us, who are afflicted with mental illness can do.  Try everything you can to get out of it.  Do not turn your nose up at any possible solution no matter how stupid/ineffective it sounds to you-  and more than likely, you will beat your depression.

It showed up in less obvious ways than normal. Thanks to my loving wife I am more aware of other ways depression manifests itself in my life. With that being said I'm tryin to make sure to be aware of these symptoms so I can better attack them. To all of you who may stumble on my comment I will try to leave you with a bit of advice that seemed to help me in the beginning and now.\nI view depression as an enemy. THE ENEMY! Depression attacks you by getting you alone first and foremost. Once your alone depression can simply leave you to your own devices and our wicked human minds do the rest. It is a battle every day and the more I remind myself of this the better I am served personally dealing with depression. My mindset is to kill the enemy (depression). Whenever I feel any symptoms I do my best to fight them or find a trigger that makes you happy or realize life isnt that bad. I call this being a warrior against depression. I hope this helps. And remember that life is beautiful now and forever even if in this moment it feels horrendous! Fight on my friends. You can win. ",

I was released and have stayed out of trouble for the most part, but life has been riddled with tradgedy, lots of ups but mostly downs. Im 34 years old with no job, extreme social anxiety, depression, most of my friends have either passed away ended up in prison or now want nothing to do with me. I recently lost my house and went through a relapse then bakeracted and now live with my mother. I got caught with marijuana and they took my license. I don't like people any more because i dont like myself, ive tried to change but cant. I have such anxiety about social situations i avoid them all together. I have nothing to be proud of, nothing real anyways. I feel like every time i get a job im singled out and bullied, i hate my existence and cant wait to die. I play scenarios of myself walking in front of a bus of truck and try to play it out in my head if i could have the guts to do it i would. I am so pathetic i cant even kill myself right. I am convinced that the people who are in my life right now would only benefit from my death. The relationships ive had ended in nothing but tradgedy and in retrospect mostly my fault. In my heart i just dont want to hurt anyone anymore and it seems like thats all i do, i self destruct and the people mixed in my life carry the consequences of it. I dont know if ill ever get better. I dont know if ill ever really jump im front of a train, but it seems like it has to be more peaceful than the torment i put myself through everyday.",

I don't even have that privilege.''\n\nUgh. I get that depression is horrible and it's taken away everything from you including what you perceive to be your personality (I also have severe depression that I can manage), but you really don't understand what it's like to have other mental illnesses that you're saying give us privilege. I have severe OCD. Not the hand washing kind, or the checking the lock kind. Not the physical fear kind. I have a purely mental kind called ''pure-O'' (in reality it's a misnomer as it's technically cognitive OCD). Imagine having constant thoughts bursting into your mind and you can't control them no matter what you do. No matter how you distract yourself, no matter what your mood is. Imagine these thoughts as being particularly violent, gruesome, disgusting, appalling, morally repugnant, vomit-inducing, panic-inducing, etc. etc. They range from violent, to sexual, to everything else. They repeat themselves in your mind over and over and over again nonstop, and the more you push them away due to fear, the more you do compulsions (behaviors or thoughts that ''neutralize'' the obsessive thoughts, or ''obsessions''), the more they return, with vengeance. It's your own mind fighting itself. Not doing compulsions will send a surge of anxiety running through you with ''what if?'' thoughts. Everything feels ''off'' like it'll never be the same if you don't perform the compulsion. I have to replace thoughts in my head as part of the compulsion cycle. On top of that, I also do bodily compulsions in accordance with mental obsessions/intrusive thoughts.\n\nWhile OCD tortures me with these thoughts and obsessive, repetitive behaviors/rituals, I also have creative thoughts. Thoughts that help me make music, or sketch. Ideas that seemingly come out of nowhere. But they're random and that contributes to a messy mind unfortunately. There's nothing privileged about having ANY kind of mental illness, whether it's depression, bipolar, OCD, or a physical illness. You suffer. All. The. Time. There is never peace, never happiness, never relief. Suicide seems much better than living but survival instinct and a slight amount of hope keep you going to endure more pain and agony. I suffer from depression as I said, OCD, AND social anxiety. By staying at home I avoid the uncomfortable feeling of being observed or judged in public. But it comes with a massive trade-off: being alone and having my mind's demons take over. OCD has not only taken any happiness I had, any hope, any personality, but it's also taken my mental stability, my emotions in general, and my senses.\n\nI'm not saying you're not empathizing, but please, meet with people with other conditions and get to know them a little personally. Depression is terrible, but there are others with depression AND other illnesses in comorbidity. You're not alone, and none of us are privileged when it comes to illness. It's hell for us all. Brutal hell.",

            "comment": "I feel the same. I'm very self-aware of how depression is making me such a boring, shitty person. For one thing, I have a very passive body language, which is apparently typical for depressed people. My feelings about this got worse when I read that depressed people can negatively affect other's moods because of humans' natural behavior to mirror the person they're talking to. If you mirror the passive body language of a depressed person, you can end up having your own mood worsen. This made me convinced that hanging out with me is bad for my friends and negatively affect their moods.  \n\n\nI also got aware of how bad the situation with my body language is when I was in a situation that was an exception from my every day life, and was in a better mood than I had been in maybe over a year. Suddenly my body language was animated, my way of speaking not nearly as monotone as usual, and I laughed in a way I never tend to do. Made me think \"is this what I could be like all the time without my depression?\" During those days I was probably like x10 more interesting and fun to be around than usual. Also made me more aware of how truly shitty a version of me my friends back home get to hang out with.  \n\n\nAlso, I'm on this Discord server where I'm part of a core group of people who have known each other for up to ten years. However lately we have gotten a lot of new members, and I'm convinced they all dislike me and consider me a super-unsympathetic person because of how my depression makes me act. I don't have energy to partake in small talk and day to day conversations. There's a lot of very positive people there who posts a lot of :) and hearts and cheer other people on and congratulate them if something good has happened etc. However I'm incapable of feeling good for other people more or less, and my mood being what it is I can't bring myself  to partake in happy!!! :) &lt;3 type of conversations. So I mostly engage when there's a negative discussion, since that fits my mood, or on the few occasions where a topic comes up that I really find interesting. I imagine this must make me look like a really shitty person who's only there when the discussion is serious/negative but never there for day to day talk or a part of the people who cheer others on or express being happy for them when good stuff happens. There's a part of me wanting to post a message explaining why I am like I am, but I'm not going to. I don't think anyone cares. It makes me feel really fucking awful though. It feels unfair being disliked for something that isn't the real you.",

    "postText": "I wish I could have a therapist on call that I could just reach out to when I felt like shit during the day. Like, please tell me that I\u2019m ok and that things are feeling bigger than they are and it\u2019s going to be ok. If a really nice, caring hug was involved, I wouldn\u2019t complain. \nI cry ALL THE TIME. I feel hopeless. I feel like this will never get better and I will just be lonely because being this sad just pushes people away because you cannot sustain healthy relationships when you\u2019re just sad and emotional all the time. I feel like there\u2019s not enough therapy in the world to help me. No medications seem to make a significant difference. But I prevail and power through, all while fearing the inevitable loneliness I feel awaits me.",

I keep reading posts like these and I feel like even though we don't have the same circumstances, we share a similar mindset and that with just how prevalent this mindset is through all of the people who post here and the countless others who don't have the courage to post, that in some way we are normal and okay.",

For the very reason you say. I know people that take it and it only made their life worse. I'd be thankful if you shared your experience on this as well.",

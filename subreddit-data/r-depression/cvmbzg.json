Using since 2013. I need to have desire to sleep though. Some days I couldn\u2019t concentrate on sleep music because of my depression and anxiety. 10 min of meditation before sleep helps me increase success rate of sleep with that music.\n\n\nPS. I have been saying about this app couple of times in this sub and r/anxiety . Am nowhere related to the developer.\n\n\nEdit:\n\n\nwww.sleepgenius.com\n\nEdit2:\n\n\nhttps://sleepgenius.com/sleep-genius-apps/ios/",

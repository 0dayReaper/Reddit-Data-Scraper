I just thought it was me not being sleepy but I would yawn and still not be able to sleep\u2026\u2026the thought of tomorrow and all the stress has never occurred to me as the reason\u2026\u2026.until I read your post.  Thanks for sharing as it has now struck a cord with me and I only just arrived here in Reddit.  \n\nMy wife and daughter are no longer here living with me after weathering the COVID storm together she has taken the initiative to get our daughter back to the UK for her next level of schooling.  Which leaves me alone at our international home (sorry don\u2019t want to say) and trying to cover debt and keep things alive.  \n\nThe sleepy and foggy day time effects are also similar even to the point of me sleeping in my car at lunch.\n\nThanks for sharing\u2026\u2026you connected some dots left unconnected for a very very long time.\n\nI also feel needing to talk but not knowing where or who to approach when a connection is all that is required can be a huge challenge.  Any suggestions ?",

Sometimes the outside world asks more of us in a daily basis than we have the emotional labour necessary to give. But because it\u2019s necessary to our survival we have to dig deep into our reserves and give it anyways and this eventually leads to burnout and depression getting worse because all of our energy is going to responsibilities and life becomes just one massive chore.",

I would like to hear more on what you do at night. I just either lay in bed or i end up working late hours even after midnight but my boss prefers i do that in the morning.\n\nAll the best to you",

Pee, wash face, pills, coffee, get dressed, work (from home) so rarely shower. Maybe every 3rd day\u2026 and then eat lunch, work till 7 or so, get stuff for dinner, watch tv, make dinner, partner comes home, eat, watch tv, stay up till 4/5 am, repeat\u2026 the only place I go is the grocery store. Oh, and the car wash every 2 weeks as I park outside because short tempered bf can\u2019t figure out how to change his address of his car so h has no permit so is in the garage and I\u2019m on the street since it costs him $50 if he parks on our street without the permit. \n\nThank you Al for sharing.

It\u2019s honestly starting to ruin my life. I love sleep but my problem is my body is never satisfied with 8-10 hours.. nah I gotta sleep 12-15 and that\u2019s not possible with my schedule for work and classes. So I usually stay up pretty late to get things done/waste time online, and catch up on sleep on the weekend..the whole weekend. And then I feel like a failure / piece of shit because I wasted all my free days doing nothing. So then I repeat the cycle of staying up late on the weekdays and abusing caffeine pills. They make me feel like shit and give me horrible muscle pains &amp; heart palpitations but honestly at this point it\u2019s the only thing that keeps me awake and focused. I need to get on meds for my ADD as leaving it untreated is really making me more depressed but that\u2019s easier said than done when you have drug abuse from 5 years ago on your medical history. Sigh sorry for the rant\n\nTLDR; I feel you 100%. You described it in better words than I could. I\u2019m abusing staying up too late and fucking up my schedule and ultimately my life if I lose my job. I wish I didn\u2019t have to work to survive.",

    "postText": "Four big things have happened in the past month:\n\n1) I've been on a few dates with this super awesome woman who I really like. We have another one coming up.\n2) I started an app a few months ago and it was recently discovered by another company who basically hired me.\n3) I just joined a comedy group. I used to do comedy in college and have been wanting to get back into it.\n4) I got a summer camp job teaching kids science.\n\nThese changes are good opportunities... and I know that they're healthier than what I'm doing now which is nothing... but I'm absolutely terrified.\n\nI can't help but remember every bridge I've burned, all the friends I've lost, my suicide attempt, my pining for approval... It makes me wish I were dead.\n\nBut I think about what I have now, which isn't much, and what I can have if I continue forward with these opportunities, and I'm pushing myself to do it.\n\nI feel like I'm going to fuck everything up like I have everything else before... but I think about my father and how hard he works, how brave he is, and I want to do these things for myself for him and my mother.\n\nHow do I keep going? Did I take on too much? They're all passions of mine. I'm trying to be the best human I can be, but a pit is opening up in my stomach and I just want to run away and hide \ud83e\udd22\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8",

I appreciate you.\n\nI think these things will be my only focus for the next few months.\n\nThey've stopped me from wasting my time smoking weed, surfing reddit, and watching YouTube videos, and literally doing nothing all day. I haven't been working or doing much of anything since I got hit by a car last year, so I feel like a bear coming out of hibernation.",

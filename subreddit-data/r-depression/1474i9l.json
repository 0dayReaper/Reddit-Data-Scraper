    "postText": "I\u2019m in too deep of a hole to ever get out. I ruined myself. I don\u2019t know what to do but I can\u2019t be alive anymore. I don\u2019t want to go back to the hospital. I can\u2019t talk to anyone or they\u2019ll bring it up. I want to kill myself more than anything. The pain wont ever stop. I\u2019ve been dead for a long time already. There\u2019s nothing for me. Someone take this pain from me please. It hurts so much. I just want to pull my heart from my chest. \n\nI hate the life i\u2019ve lived. There\u2019s nothing special about it and nothing I can look back on. I\u2019ve been isolated for years and it\u2019s changed me. I only want to be happy again. It just won\u2019t ever be possible. I hate everyone. I hate waking up. I hate brushing my teeth. I hate showering. I hate going outside. I hate eating. I hate my room. I hate my bed. I\u2019m never going to get better. Fuck everything. Fuck everyone.",

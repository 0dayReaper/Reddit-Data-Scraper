    "postText": "My whole life, the only thing I've always wanted was a lover. A mutual lover, who I love and who loves me, who I can make happy and who makes me happy, who I can fall asleep with, who I can travel with, who I can laugh, cry and live a content, fulfilling life with. I guess this is my benchmark for a successful life. Maybe that's my problem, I want that love, romance and intimacy so much but I'm not good enough. There's nothing to me.\n\nEveryone I've ever liked has either been very indifferent towards me or abandoned me after a few days or weeks. They always have at least ten guys they care more about or are more interesting than I am. Who have talents, are interesting to talk to or are really confident and charismatic. Plus, they have a vision for the future besides waiting for some angel of a woman to descend from the heavens and warm their cold, dead heart.\n\nWhen it's someone I don't like or don't care about, they're all in. My last relationship was dull and lifeless, we didn't connect at all. The only reason we dated is because I settled for her. Meanwhile, I watched this girl I worked with and really liked. She was beautiful, sweet, cute and even kind of funny. But she moved away to Tucson and I never saw her again.\n\nI don't know what I do wrong with these women. I always think we're getting along, I always think things are going well, I think they'll get serious but they never do. They are always gone as quickly as they came. I want to make her feel special, loved and lucky to be with me. \n\nNothing besides this interests me. No hobbies, careers, future goals interest me. I've tried to distract myself and make a man out of me, but it all comes back to my desire for romance. This is all I have, I just want to look hold the woman I love in mya arms, look her in the eyes and, meaning every word, say \"I love you\".",

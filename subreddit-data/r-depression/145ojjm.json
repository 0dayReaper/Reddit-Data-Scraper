    "postText": "I'm afraid my fear has turned into reality. \nMy trauma has turned me into a jaded and coldhearted monster. I'm bitter and angry at everything. \nI called my grandma stupid. I keep lashing out at her. she keeps asking for more from me than I can give right now. I'm autistic, trying to deal with all my trauma and mental illness alone, being closeted to my queerphobic family and my financial struggles plus the stress of working. \nI don't want to be like this.",

Ask for help, accept help. Trust me. I love you very much and it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay if you hurt someone or yourself. It\u2019s okay. There is nothing that you can do now but please just allow yourself to be loved and know that it\u2019s all about trying your best to learn and make progress. It\u2019s also okay to mess up again but never stop trying to be better.",

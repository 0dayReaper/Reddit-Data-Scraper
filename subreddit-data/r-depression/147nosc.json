    "postText": "I feel this way all the time. Like I have to prove I'm worthy to even eat a sad meal. That I have worked hard to bring food to the table. These thoughts are getting out of hand. It's like I have no value of my own, being alive seems a liability to others. Except for when I go to work. Then I might just be able to justify my existence. Now that I have come to this refreshing realisation, I'm happier than before. I don't even care about money anymore. I've been set free. Nobody cares about me anyway. They act like they care, to get what they want from me, until I can give no longer. I really am worthless. I am not myself. I am my job, my money and my position. A bit sad isn't it.",

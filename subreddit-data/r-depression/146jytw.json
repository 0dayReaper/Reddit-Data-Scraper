    "postText": "I've been struggling with depression for roughly a year, and last October it became so overwhelming that I had a complete nervous breakdown and was completely nonfunctional for weeks afterwards. I started treatment and nowadays I'm much more stable, but less in the sense that I feel happier and more that I'm just more emotionally detached and sort of numb. It feels both better and worse than the intense pain\u2014it's a relief not being one minor inconvenience from hysterical tears, but I'm very much self-aware of how anhedonic I am when I try to do the things that used to bring me joy.\n\nYesterday I went on a daytrip to see a live show that I was obsessed with in my teens. It was just as incredible as I'd imagined and I spent the whole time grinning so much my cheeks hurt and crying out of sheer joy &amp; nostalgia, to the point where a random older woman in the crowd came over and hugged me afterwards. It was like the numbness was suddenly stripped away all at once. I can't even put into words how overwhelming it was to feel genuine, unsullied happiness again and to realize that I've been missing out on it for the last year, even on what I would've considered \"good days\". \n\nI thought I'd be riding that wave at least for a couple days, but today I woke up and I felt fucking awful. It's not even that tolerable numbness. I feel like I've been gutted. I don't know if it's some sort of emotional comedown after the highs of yesterday or if I've returned to how I usually feel and I'm just realizing now how truly fucked my emotional state has been for the last year.",

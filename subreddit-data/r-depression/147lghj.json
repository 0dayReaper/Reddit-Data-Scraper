It seems like its never ending i have tried beating it with positive mindset and all that bullshit but Loop is never ending, darkness comes around  every few days. Can I forgive myself for what mistakes i have Made, should I disassociate with those mistakes but people keeps reminding me about what I have done. What is a best way of handling it i do not know. I used to think i have potential and ill be doing good things in life and now everything seems farfetched. I thought of ending it all but Family I can not do this to them. how can someone gain perspective if he has lost it all. I am my worst enemy.",

            "comment": "Therapists can help with perspective. They listen without judgement and guide you forward when the path ahead feels cloudy. \n\nPositive mindset can only do so much, like putting a smiling mask over a sad face. \n\nDo you take any medication? I\u2019ve found that for me antidepressants clear the clouds enough to let you actually think and reorient yourself.",

During this state First half I was not aware that i was going this way and I did try Reading, Exercise, Meditation, friends and family Help during this time, never went for professional help all that did work for while but it came back to circle and now I am where I was. is it beyond help. I am Not very much educated on who Therapy and  anti depressant works. I guess it's time to go for Pills.\n\nThanks mate!!",

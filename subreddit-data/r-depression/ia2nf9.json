What the fuck am I working towards ? Doesn't seem like I have any purpose in life even though I'm 26 and most people my age are making their careers and starting to settle down.\n\nAnything I do is to distract myself from my thoughts but I end up at the same dark place at the end of every day. Honestly feel like instead of growing as a person, I deteriorated in the last few years.\n\nI have no motivation left except that I love my parents and them having to witness my death will destroy them. If only there was a way to erase myself from everyone's memories.",

A state of perpetual reactivity is then internalized, and the soul, which as you've justly pointed out, needs time for the body to relax for contemplation and eventually amplify the consciousness horizon in which real Meaning is beheld, it starves slowly to death.

When I say potential I don't mean it in the sense of productivity but just the potential to be more, whatever that may mean to them. So everyone, myself included, wonders what is the point even? I might as well keep it to myself and celebrate it \"one day\" when the situation is more ideal. Or that I might as well do what seems to be working for everyone and see if it might work for me.

My social anxiety saved me as there were other people around at the time and I fear people more than death. \n\nToday I keep the devil at bay with a herb and a passion for art. I don't regret what happened, i try to be grateful for the number of days I've lived past that day, so that view has a lot of meaning to me but I would be very much be hesitant to revisit it.\n\nI wish I could focus more energy on life than death, I feel stranded in between. Love, purpose and gratitude go a long way in helping ones mind cope with such feelings.",

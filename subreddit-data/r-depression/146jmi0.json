    "postText": "Hi all,\n\n\r  \nI'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, please let me know if there is a more relevant place to post this.\n\n\r  \nThis is more of my outlet more than anything, to post anonymously... But also to seek advice. I feel lost... I feel like I've hit rock bottom lately. I'm 27M and I've never been to a club before, never really had friends that liked to go out. Never really been on a date before. I played games throughout my early to mid 20s and I regretted it.\n\n\r  \nI used to love playing video games, in my school years, I pretty much made friends with everyone because I would be sort of a mimic who would change to suit the likes of anyone I would like to be friends with. I was a very likeable person... But I still struggled to make a strong connection with people.\n\n\r  \nBut, I did make a strong connection with some friends, unfortunately for me, with the wrong sort of people looking back for me. I really grounded myself and was myself (not a mimic) with the nerds who enjoyed playing games. I was a shy kid, but had the ability to put a mask on to make friends with the cool kids too - I just couldn't make a strong connection with them.\n\n\r  \nFast foward post school - I never went to collage, got lucky (or unlucky depending on how you look at it) and found a professional job right out the gate. This cut out a very important part of my life as a young adult - making friends in collage.\n\n\r  \nI contrinued to play games in my free time, because I enjoyed it. But - one day I met someone, someone who changed my perspective on life. She showed me a lot that I was missing out on life. This wasn't long ago that this happened.\n\n\r  \nI now feel depressed because I feel like I've thrown my life away to video games and missed out on really crucial parts of my life. I'm working on myself these days, getting fit, learning new things - trying to meet new people who align with my interests as they evolve...\n\n\r  \nPlease don't look at this as me bashing on the nerds out there. I love nerds, it's what I grew up as (kind of, more mixed with nerds and cool kids) - and some of my closest friends (lucky for me I have 1) - he is also a nerd. I will forever have a place in my heart for that sort of thing. But that isn't me anymore. I'd call myself a introverted-extrovert. It's probably the worst type of person to be as you are too shy to do things you want to do (like go partying).\n\n\r  \nI'm not sure what this is... I just need to get this out there, so I don't suffocate on my own thoughts. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm running a marathon which I'm losing, and at 27 - I feel like too much damage has been done now and I can only improve myself from here out.\r  \nSomething awokened in me which was my true inner-self. Has anyone else been in my shoes before, what advice would you give to someone like me.\n\n\r  \nAnd lastly, please don't think I'm going to hurt myself or anything, I'm not, that isn't what I do - I fight - I just need advice - but even if I don't get advice, I'LL KEEP FIGHTING. \r  \nIF YOU ARE FEELING LOST LIKE ME, YOU ARE NOT ALONE!",

            "comment": "Hey there! I'm turning 30 this year and man, your post is basically a copy/paste of my life in so many ways. I wasted my childhood ignoring people and just playing videogames in my room alone. My parents were even worried about me all throughout grade school since I didn't hangout with anyone on weekends or really leave my room much. Looking back, I'm not sure I would do anything different though. You see, I'm on the autism spectrum and it took me a long, long time to learn how to talk to people without saying something odd or outright unrelated to the conversation. I learned through trial and error how to converse with people so I do have quite a few embarrassing memories unfortunately but at least I learned from them! I'm happy to see in your post that you are working so hard on yourself, that's more than admirable it's outright fantastic! Being that I'm on the spectrum I don't really like things like clubs (I live in Iowa so there aren't clubs to go to anyway lol) or even big parties but I was always kinda jealous of the people who were able to comfortably go to such places. I see you're asking for advice but to be honest you seem to be ahead of me in life haha but I can mention one thing that I hope you find helpful! Be open to asking for help whenever you need it and keep fighting for yourself, be your own greatest advocate. If you ever need a place to go to for help or need someone to talk to, reddit will always be here waiting!",

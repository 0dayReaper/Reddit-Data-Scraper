    "postText": "\n\n\n\nGetting out of bed seems like an inhuman task. Once I\u2019m out of it, all I want to do is return to it and lie down. If I\u2019m standing or walking, all I want to do is sit and do nothing. The inertia is overwhelming.\n\nThe disconnect between my thoughts and speech or writing has been greater than usual. Not everyone necessarily has this problem, and I have this problem all the time (I\u2019m prone to \u201cspoonerisms\u201d and other speech issues when I talk, like difficulty searching for a term that\u2019s just out of my grasp even though I know it, or a name of a person or object). It\u2019s been utterly terrible this week. I\u2019ve been more prone to writing letters and words out of order, including typing errors.\n\nOverall \u201cbrain fog\u201d has increased. I have more \u201cdead spots\u201d in my thought process when I just get lost looking for an idea or a word and have to use what seems like a pointless physical stim to generate that thought. I am also prone to spacing out and forgetting what I\u2019m doing as I\u2019m doing it.\n\nSeveral times per day, I forget what day it is and what\u2019s on my schedule. I barely know what time of day it is throughout the day without checking. I have a to-do list that feels like a mile long, and even the simplest tasks on it seem insurmountable. I feel exhausted after just sending an email.\n\nI see every potential social interaction as a chore, no matter who the person is. They could be a client or a close friend, and I feel I have to do as much mental and physical preparation for that interaction to make sure I don\u2019t enter it looking and feeling like road kill. If the interaction ends up not happening, I waver between a feeling of deflation and relief.\n\nI\u2019m normally prone to mirroring the emotions of those around me and find that my facial muscles will react to laughter and smiles if the situation warrants it, though with a lot more time and effort than the average person; this week, those reactions come a lot slower than usual for me, if ever. The performances I try to put on for clients to put them at ease don\u2019t come at all, as far as the smiling and brighter tone of voice. I can\u2019t manage it for basic everyday transactional interactions with other customer service representatives at stores, et cetera, though I am always polite.\n\nI consistently put off even the tasks that have to do with activities I used to find pleasurable, because doing them require several sub-activities, and putting those steps together in order is too much effort for me to handle, and requires too much motivation. It is too exhausting to even think about.\n\nI avoid talking to friends, and justify it by thinking that they haven\u2019t contacted me, either, so they probably wouldn\u2019t want to hear from someone who\u2019s been basically depressed and angry for years, and is even more depressed lately. I also justify it by remembering how their schedules clash with mine and remembering how busy they are, how I\u2019m supposed to be doing other things, and come up with a million reasons why I have no time for them and they have no time for me.\n\nI put off going to bed every night because I know I\u2019ve procrastinated on every single task on my immense to-do list, but then endlessly debate with myself about whether I should waste time or do those tasks, knowing how little real time I have, and end up doing nothing of use except for micromanage things.\n\nI have a constantly running debate with myself and countless imaginary projections of real and imagined people in my head about multiple topics, including essays and music I have yet to write, and it is an ongoing source of frustration. This is either a symptom of or a contributing factor to my depression.",

So i finally can live like any other human being,... First think i did was planning for a fresh start, and make sure not to fall in depression again... I started working out, going out more even by myself, reading books about mental health (books saved my life), learning  a new language, \n\nThen after a year i stopped taking the meds cause i dont need them anymore... \n\nJust wanted to say, brother it gets better, just understand ur issue (depression), then deal with it,\nLife's good brother, ure just in pain\nPain that u can get rid of, if u know how",

I\u2019m tired of people laughing at me for being so quiet or making jokes like \u201coh I didn\u2019t even know you were there\u201d, \u201ci thought you were invisible,\u201d \u201cwhy are you so quiet,\u201d etc. i\u2019ve had another teacher make fun of me in front of other students because she said i was \u201cno fun\u201d for being a quiet person. Why does every single person that comes into contact with me hate me i should just kill myself",

No good teacher makes fun of or gives depressed students a hard time. A good teacher may be tough on you to get the best out of you, but never should they make a mockery of your emotional state, especially not in today's world. Teachers in general are psychotic bullies who have no lives or dark depressing lives of their own. If you come across a good one, savor the experience and let them know how much they mean to you. Forget all of the other ones.",

People saw through me too so it wasn't even worth to keep the charade up and that allowed me redistribute those resources on some activities that brought me joy, like reading, playing games or learning new things that interested me specifically. \n\nFeel hugged and don't let others determine your worth. There is plenty of qualities on being on the quieter side once you find some like-minded people but younger persons especially struggle with that, often out of fear too, they can't relate to that behaviour and therefore they can tend to bully the behaviour they don't grasp. \n\nI'm sorry your teachers are joining such childish behaviour, unfortunately some never learn but the bad moments will pass.",

When thay say stuff like \"why are you so quiet\" It just means they want hear your vioce maybe get to know you, they are just curious. \n\n  \nYou sound like a sweet and kind person, but you are also going through so much hurt on the inside, they don't hate you, they just don't know what you are going through.",

You will graduate and live your life, you cant choose who you study with but after that those people dont mean a single thing to you. I spend 4 years in secondary school getting bullied, 3 years in highschool being branded as the weird kid and im still here. The only opinions that matter are from people that you care about. People that never live a day of your life, never reach out to you, those opinions doesnt worth a single dime. So i hope you finish your education and have people that care about around you. And since you are a girl i suggest getting a decent boyfriend, boys love quiet girls more than they are willing to admit :))",

She was the one and I lost her because I'm a piece of shit. Sorry I just had to vent :(",

I know this seems like an irredeemable mistake, but treat this as an experience, i have lost the girls that i think will be my destiny for like, 3 times already. But feeling sad because of her doesnt worth it when she dont have any feeling for you. The best thing you can do is take a deep breath, imagine gathering all of your thoughts and emotions in your lung and then exhale, clear your mind and move on. On the other hand the worst thing you can do is stalk her bf, hire some girl to flirt with him and expose him ( get the girl to do that, NEVER show anything that you are related and DONT have any contact with your dream girl in the process). When they break up just swoop in and console her",

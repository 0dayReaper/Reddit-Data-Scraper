It\u2019d just be so much easier than disappointing everyone I love if something just happened to me and I died. I know it isn\u2019t right to think like this but I can\u2019t stop.\n\n\nEdit: this blew up, it\u2019s kinda bittersweet knowing so many others feel the same.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all so much for the words of encouragement. I\u2019m home now and would love to reply to all of them but I have to do homework. Things will get better for all of us if there\u2019s this much support in the world.",

You wouldn't have to work anymore but there's the chance of brain damage, needing help going to bathroom, loads of issues, it's just not worth it. But like I said, I get it, apathy is the worst symptom of them all imo. I'd rather you, or anyone for that matter, not suffer more than we already have, so look both ways when you cross the streets guys.",

I believe it's your choice in the end, you didn't have a choice in being conjured into this plane of existence in the first place and if your life is nothing but suffering, you should have the option. But as soon as you move to harm another life in the process of ending your own, that's where I lose all respect for the person. As an example, school shooters, hitting pedestrian(s) before driving off a bridge, any murder-suicide. You were suffering, I understand, but you didn't have to make someone else or even multiple people feel your pain.",

My suffering is mine to bear, not someone completely unrelated to me. If my family grieves for me, that's fine (I mean it's not fine, I don't want them to grieve me, I want them to get over my death and live their lives) but I couldn't live with myself if a poor train conductor had to live with the PTSD of my jumping onto the rails.\n\nThat's also why I would have a hard time going to, say, the suicide forest at the base of Mt. Fuji and hang myself. I know someone would have to clean up after me, cut down my corpse etc.. and ultimately someone would have to seek counselling because of my actions.\n\nI may want to die, but I don't want to leave the world a worse place by making unnecessary ripples with my death.",

Sounds like the perfect spot to jump in front of a train from, right?\n\nIt's so perfect that there's now a locked gate at both ends of the bridge and a tall railing to prevent people from jumping. The gates are locked at night.\n\nIn my worldview, suicide is already selfish enough as it is (because it will leave your family and friends scarred) but really...taking it out on someone else is such a shitty thing to do..",

But forming the goal is just a matter of taking stock of what you like to do, and what you want to do with your life. Even if these things aren't clear, taking something you enjoy, or even enjoyed in the past, and making it your goal can be a great way to focus yourself.\n\nI like learning languages and vidya for example, and I put them together by playing foreign games and learning language from them. I don't make any money doing it and it's something I largely do alone, but it's still something I can increase in skill in day by day. For life, though, all I wanted to be satisfied with myself was to have a romantic partner and a job that I could work to keep myself afloat through my own work, and those two are already done. Took several years, but they're here.\n\nSo is there anything you like to do, big or small, you could turn into a hobby, or better yet, work?",

Dealing with external issues by switching work or moving away from abusers to refocus the mind is more important.\n\nBut taking the fight to the mental battleground (CBT or another kind of therapy) is most vital.

I can't imagine smokers daydreaming of smoking, pedophiles daydreaming of violating children, dieters daydreaming of pizza... or the suicidal visualizing death, to be either positive or simply having no effect. If thoughts can develop into feelings and control actions, then the opposite thoughts, in time, should have the opposite effect of cleaning out the dark or destructive heart.\n\nBut if you disagree, I suppose the only other solution I can think of is medication. If that's the route you go for, I hope you find the best doc and the most effective meds to crush any mental troubles you have for good, bud.",

Especially with depression, the fight can last awhile even with meds and/or a therapist. But also, don't put yourself down more with expectations, you're exactly the dad he needs to prepare him for the real world, and even if you somehow end up being the worst dad in existence, which I highly doubt just from our encounter, honestly just having a parent is better than being an orphan. Anyways, remember fixing yourself is a process, don't crumble because you see where you're at now and the finish line seems insanely far, you'll get there, if not for yourself, for your son. I would list suggestions but eh, everyone has their own way of healing.",

The most difficult thing is I know what I should be doing to get better - eat properly, keep decent schedule, talk to friends, exercise, meditate, positive self talk, going to doctor, change inner dialogue.. etc. \n\nTrouble is when feeling like just giving up it is not easy to find a reason to even try to improve. Lately it's getting to the point where I keep wondering if it's better for me to just disappear somewhere. \n\nAs much as I find organized religions a bit overbearing I can see that perhaps it is a way to regain some direction till I get myself together. That said, I'm horribly cynical and placing any amount of trust in another person/group is difficult.\n\nTrying to find something I can take joy in or attain some sort of hope from is frustrating, I watch videos and read to get some emotional reactions but still feel hollow after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt does feel like if I can just get one small thing started can climb out of this pit, but as I guess people know the pit is pretty comfortable. One thing might try again is taking a look at values, an exercise I did once where you have these papers with all sorts of words on them like 'Joy', 'Family', 'Boldness', 'Ambition'. Sorting through the hundred or so papers to find your top 5. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe just need a starting point of wanting to get through to the next day, something I can take a small amount of pride in even if it is meaningless in the grand scheme of things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to say thank you for making this post, it gave me the incentive to write a bit about my experience and in doing so helped me work some things out while sorting out my thoughts. Hope you find a reason to keep going, I know it isn't easy and is elusive as fuck, but... I have no idea, in the same boat, so just taking it one day at a time.",

Happy? content? Etc. Likewise define your open observation criteria, \n\nNow while eating, just feel, is the food hot? How tasty was it? Are you chewing enough? Etc. \n\nNow for every other activity, so on . \n\nDo this for 3 days, I bet you'll have a different feeling about what you just said!! Practice mindfulness, it has to be our daily routine!!

I guess I wouldn't mind either way (even if I know that they will be hurt in the process as well, but I won't be the one to do it)\n\nLooks like I'm in the majority although due to different reasons.

Family, love, friends, fame, success, recognition, money, finding oneself, improvement, spirituality, belief, power, thrill, justice and many others are more or less common human goals that most people have. I have none. I'm not \"living life\" nor \"surviving\" , I am simply waiting for death.

Random death is just saving your hands of blood, but in the end it doesnt matter since you'are already fucking dead.",

I used to resent them since I have to keep carrying on with all this pain but I guess I have no choice but to keep going for them. Some days are great though and we have to do everything in our power to remember those good days. I guess it'll make everything else easier.",

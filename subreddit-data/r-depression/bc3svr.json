For instance when I was in high school I didn\u2019t have a job, once I got a job I dreaded going into work so much, I just wanted to stay home and chill. Even though I would just chill and think about how shitty everything is, where once I got to work it\u2019d suck and I\u2019d hate it but I would think about what I wanted to do once I got out, and then once I got out I was excited to do whatever I was thinking about at work.

So everyday now even though i still work at my job when i get home i try to make my something, something i love. for me music is always something ive felt very connected to and touched by and i cant even play it. Im now trying to make a life that revolves around it, so everyday i wake up i know im doing something that i love. point is try to make your something, something you love to do or at least pushing yourself in that right direction.",

Tachycardia when getting up.I have no one. I am always totally alone. Finished, destroyed.I can not stand anymore. \n\nI hate waking up in the morning. i hate being alive\n\nI need someone to talk to, who is not a psychologist to whom I pay 70 euros an hour and after 6 sessions he didn't even know my name without having to look at my personal file.\n\nI need to feel like some of this is worth it. Or else, leave everything already.\n\nPlease.",

Feels like brain candy. \n\n\nAlso, it feels good taking pleasure in the idea that no one knows myself better than I do. That way, whether I choose to better myself or destroy myself, I take pride in the decision either way since it was MY decision, with no input from others.",

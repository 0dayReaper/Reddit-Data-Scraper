    "postText": "I\u2019m in my thirties and have had a difficult life. For the most part I have put it behind me.\n\nI\u2019ve gone to Uni and smashed my first year. I\u2019ve also experienced a variety of incredible opportunities for which I feel truly blessed. Not just mundane things like holidays, but things some people could only dream of.\n\nI\u2019m not well off by any stretch of the imagination, however, by comparison to how things have been for me in the past, worrying about paying bills is not an issue. Everything, on paper at least, appears to be perfect, but I just can\u2019t feel happy.\n\nI know I am depressed but I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out why.\n\nI\u2019m not on drugs but do drink socially. A close relative has bipolar disorder and I honestly see some similarities. Though not to the same extreme. Sometimes I\u2019m so motivated and nothing can hold me back, and other times I\u2019m good for nothing, nothing will ever change and I should just give up trying now.",

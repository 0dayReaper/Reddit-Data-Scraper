Your view and post are very negative and cynical but you didn't deserve to be called disgusting so I'm sorry for that. \n\nFor the last question though, I would never be supportive of someone saying they hate all people... does someone who says that really earn support and nurturing and emotional validation from other humans?",

I do not want support from someone like that. The fact that you act like this after your prefrontal cortex has fully developed is extremely sad and troubling and if I end up like you at your age I don't know what I'll do. I'd suggest you take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror and think about the state of yourself and your morals right now.\n\nAnd P.S. I don't care if you said almost, nearly, approximately, or anything synonyms related to that. That was inappropriate, ignorant, and against the rules of the subreddit... and I don't think you fully got rid of your arrogance yet (like you claim is tied into depressed people's experiences) so I'd suggest doing some work.\n\nI don't want your sympathy, and you're not on a high horse for me to desire it specifically from you.",

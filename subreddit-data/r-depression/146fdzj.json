    "postText": "I should probably elaborate they understand I have depression hell I told them that I want to off myself and they did help me get a therapist and my mother (who has done the most in that regard) has been talking about getting me on medication. \n\nBut in the same breath she has been talking about sending me away from my only real support network to work in the country side acting like it will make me more happy or productive all while not understanding that I have relatively few good days and they down play my hobbies or accomplishments and wonder why i don't let them into my life.\n\nMy question is what am I supposed to do in this situation. I can't move away I am trying to get into a school nearby and the therapist thing didn't work after I had a panic attack about not doing a list she gave me and panic cancelled the next session. What should I do?",

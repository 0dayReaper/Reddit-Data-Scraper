There are days I feel panicky to leave the house but my brother will ask me out to breakfast and I\u2019ll dress nice and put on some make up and I feel good for forcing myself to go out instead of staying home. I have another brother who invites me up to Lake Tahoe to stay with his wife and him and I go, even tho I know he\u2019s planned a hike for us lol  I hate hiking because I\u2019m not in shape to do it at that altitude and they hike all the time but again I force myself to. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid of saying no to people. I also said yes to my nephew /wife that I would love to babysit their 15 mo old little girl. I feel so good doing that and when I force myself to do things I\u2019m not sitting in the house thinking about it.  It\u2019s tough sometimes but you gotta try it. \nI wish you well and a speedy recovery and most of all a better outlook \u263a\ufe0f",

The doc is putting in a device that is gonna hold the two vertebra apart so they stop pinching nerves. Mostly hitting the sciatic nerve on both sides, atm. But some days, it's depression pure and simple and I'll use the pain as a reason, even tho the pain isn't horrible that day. I try to do things, but a lot of the time, I want to cry from the pain or I can't catch my breath it hurts so bad... It's hard, cuz even my friends don't check on me much at all... they say they missed me when they see me, but never message me in between to see how I'm doing. Online people have become most of my social contact, honestly...",

I can\u2019t even imagine going through that day after day, not to mention how much it affects depression.  I understand about no one checking on you and it\u2019s really messed up that they can\u2019t even come over to see if you need anything or just to visit.  People can be so insensitive. I was driving home from a weekend away and I was thinking about how much I am asked and depended on to do for others yet no one feels the same towards me. I started crying! I mean my daughter had a dog that I used to baby sit while her and her husband go traveling, sometimes 2 1/2 -3 weeks. They\u2019re going to Disneyland this coming week and asked me to come to their house and watch the dog. Doesn\u2019t ask me before she bus the plane tix. I have a brother who can\u2019t drive out of town by himself. Had a major panic attack when he was around 20 while he was driving and hasn\u2019t driven out of town since. So he calls me to go do things like take and pick up his son from college, about a 2 1/2 to 3 hour drive one way. So it\u2019s a whole day event. There\u2019s other places out of town that I go to also. He at least he calls me regularly to check in and and we do go to breakfast and lunches. And my family knows I have depression and anxiety sometimes but yet when I\u2019m talking to them about lack of motivation I get this whole shit talk like \u201cyou really need to speak affirmations to yourself, that will help\u201d or \u201cyou should get a job\u201d and all those stupid things that are for people with a temporary sadness or ones who don\u2019t have depression real bad. They don\u2019t fucking get no motivation thing. I also have fibromyalgia which doesn\u2019t hurt to horribly every day but there are things that will trigger it. My daughter (36) was at my house one weekend and I was in my bathroom sitting on the toilet ( lid was down, I was kinda hiding in there) and I was just sobbing. She comes in and looks at me like I\u2019m a leper or something and I tell her this is how bad it gets sometimes. Standing there with her arms crossed says I need to talk to Uncle John about that because she can\u2019t deal with it! A hug and a mom I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ll be ok would have been nice. So then I don\u2019t want to tell my family about my depression so I hold it inside where it gets worse. I hope and pray that your surgery goes well and you are freed from all your pain",

Totally understandable if those resources aren't available or you don't have the means to do so:( I just hate so much hearing that you were crying in the bathroom and didn't get the support you needed in that moment. Nothing makes depression worse than that kind of shit! There is no specific explanation for how it affects people and it affects everyone differently. That's why it's such a monster. There are cognitive, physiological, genetic and a shit ton of different components to it and they manifest differently for each person. Suggesting that you simply talk to someone else who has it may only be beneficial in that it can help normalize the experience and decreases isolation. Talking to a professional is a different kind of outlet completely. Feel free to pm me if you need to talk more. Sending you many positive vibes:) ",

I do actually see a therapist, one I started seeing when I first got sober in \u201888, and on and off over the years. I started seeing her because my health care provider, Kaiser Permanente, had such shitty help in their mental health department. Therapy for 1/2 hr every 4-5 weeks ($50) and able to see psychiatrist to talk about meds once a year. So I went back to her and it really helps, especially because she knows me. I was just talking about my family because I\u2019ve heard so many times after a suicide the family say \u201cwe didn\u2019t know it was that bad\u201d or \u201cwe didn\u2019t know she/he had it\u201d.  It\u2019s because a lot of people can\u2019t handle someone with depression because they just don\u2019t know what to do for that person (listening with a sympathetic ear) or don\u2019t want to hear all their sad shit. People who don\u2019t have depression don\u2019t understand how it feels to have it. They think of it as being sad all the time and that you should just snap out of it. I was mostly bothered that my daughter couldn\u2019t just give me a hug and say I\u2019m sorry mom that you go through this. Like fuck, how many times when she was growing up and came to me with something bothering her and I told her to go somewhere else? Never! Comforting someone isn\u2019t hard unless you\u2019re trying to fix them and you don\u2019t have to do that",

It's super shitty that you can't frickin go more often (goddamn health insurance-at least under ACA companies are mandated to cover it in some way...with the new GOP one, this will sadly not be the case). But yeah that's probably the most frustrating part of explaining mental health and substance use issues...it's not about morals and choices. We're not immoral people that decide to drink or use and suffer the consequences because of we don't care about ourselves or others. We're not weak people that can't \"pull ourselves up by our bootstraps\" because there is something that makes us inherently inferior. Not only are there so many factors (out of our control) that contribute to both, they both eventually begin to alter the way our brains function making our actions and decisions even more out of our control. I don't know why some people can pick up a drink 1x per month, get shitty drunk and not drink again until the next month while others drink the first time and can't stop. Idk why some people get in a car accident and it doesn't seem to affect them while others can't even drive any more because they have perpetual panic attacks. Maybe those are the questions we should be asking. Maybe we should invest our money into answering those questions rather than putting money into institutions that function only to isolate these marginalized groups and \"protect\" the \"normal\" people.

Other stuff I do feel guilty and I say to myself \u201c you can either melt into this chair or just start living your life again. It wasn\u2019t long ago when you had some spark left\u201d and that helps. Some days are just harder than others. Overcast rainy days are easy to melt into the chair with a blanket. Hope this helps!! Like Nike says, Just Do It \ud83d\ude01\n\nEdit: I also should have said that I\u2019m very fortunate to have family near me that ask me to do things a lot.  Two brothers that are always doing things and invite me along and my 2 grown children.  It\u2019s nice that I get this time to spend with all of them",

I avoid responsibility like the plague and I avoid taking any positive steps in my life to be a better person. I simply do not have any motivation, will, ambition or whatever else you wanna call it. It's funny how different we are and yet we arrive at the same thought: I am probably not gonna end things anytime soon but I sure wish I would just stop existing and be erased from memories. The ironic thing is, if I went through the efforts you did I would probably stop hating myself and find some purpose in life. It's a fine line between lazyness and depression and I honestly believe I am on the wrong side of it. What I am trying to say is maybe take a look at the bright side- you know you have a real problem and you are at least facing your issues the best you can.

Twice I went to the hospital to try and get help instead I got beat down by cops because It wasn't worth and I wanted to go home.  They said nope and the betting began.  Funny thing is I myself was a cop.  fifteen years into it I got hurt which ended my career.  The injuries eventually took everything.  I can sleep or watch TV.  Thats all for the past ten years.\n\nSO many folks are all alone and without hope.  Some of those folks actually aren't in as bad shape as they think.  Mostly the young ones who haven't had a chance to experience life.  Most under thirty, who aren't seriously handicapped anyway, still have a chance to be something they can be proud of.  \n\nI'm 60.  I've did more things by the time I was 38 than most folk do in a life time.  But in the big picture I have failed at every major event in my life.  Dropped out of college.  Didn't finish my twenty years.  Raised two kids are even worse off than I am.  There's more, but it doesn't matter.  Most folk when they die and have accomplished nothing can say they raised kids who did better than they did.  That would nice.\n\nTaking your own life is tough.  People say its the cowards way out.  It isn't.  Not even close.  In the state of mind of a person who decides to take their own life, they see it as making life better for those who care about them.  Leaving them behind is hard.  Add to that having a military/law enforcement background, suicide is doubly taboo.  \n\nIn my career I talked a couple folks out of putting a bullet in the head of overdosing.  Looking back now, I'm not sure I did them any good.  Ah well.....it dont matter anyway.\n\nI'm counting on getting a redo on life after death.  I dont buy into a god as presented by religions.  I think we keep doing this life over until we get it right.  I think I have two memories of other lives and in both I died young.  One when I was twelve and one when I was seventeen.  Both were such I could go back and verify there were folk who dies as I remember with all the circumstances the same.  Dont know if that real or not.  I like to believe there is something better after this life once we get this life done right.\n\nWell...I guess I had a lot to unload.  Was just going to make a couple sentences and agree with a lot of you.  If all of us could get together in one place for a couple of days I think most of could find whatever it is we need to move forward.  Kinda like, we should all meet at Depot Bay, OR on May 15th of 2018.  LOL....\n\nI hope all of you who are struggling can find an answer.  I know its different for everyone.  Some can find help in religion, others in art or a career change.  Maybe more education.  Maybe a new job.  I dont know.  But for most of you the answer is within your grasp, all you have to do is left up your head and reach out your hand.  Be prepared to work for it as almost nothing in this life is free.  Buts its there none the less.\n\nFor the one and half of you who actually read this...thank you.  :-D ",

    "postText": "Something I've struggled with a long time is dealing with the cleanup of a depression room after a long slump. Just when you start to feel better, its very easy to get overwhelmed by the mess you've created and have been living in for a long period of time. Now it's time to clean that, for me that gets overwhelming and becomes burdensome occasionally throwing me back into that \"hole.\" The laundry pile is one of the biggest burdens for me as it's time consuming, and if forgotten the laundry will stink or wrinkle needing to be washed again. Yesterday I discovered wash and fold laundry at my local laundromat. I didn't have the energy to do my laundry, but I built up the courage to put it into trash bags and drive myself down to the laundromat. Total of 9 trash bags of laundry and they charged me $2.50 a lb. It becomes pricey, albeit extremely expensive I spent $200 doing this but god was it worth it. Would I make it a regular habit? No, but it's a good step in the right direction. \n\nFeel free to put any tips below for getting out of the depression funk and not going down that hole again!\n\nTLDR; depression room got overwhelming, local laundromat cleaned all 9 bags of laundry.

    "postText": "I got laid off my job 3 weeks ago. I recently bought a home and moved to a complete new city without knowing anyone and ever since my job loss I\u2019ve gotten more and more lonely. I have tried everything but Everyday seems like a new struggle. I tend to take naps now, which only make me feel worse when I wake up. \n\nThe area I live in doesn\u2019t allow for many social groups as it\u2019s very small and family focused. Any tips on what to do? I keep looking at the time looking forward to the part of the day I get to sleep. I\u2019m struggling and I have 0 energy to do much.",

    "postText": "Do you guys think I'm depressed?\n\nI know it's a weird question to ask, especially when there are a lot of strangers that don't know me, but I just wanted some input. To start off, I am on a few meds for epilepsy and 1 for pseudobulbar affect. I am disabled and can't drive, so I sit at home all day and watch TV or play video games. I also play with my dog as much as I can in between those activities and taking naps. I take 1-2 naps a day because I'm tired as hell. I don't know if it's from boredom or from depression. I also tend not to feed myself when I'm hungry. I have to force myself to get up from the couch and eat. I usually don't eat breakfast and eat lunch around 3 pm and force myself to eat supper so I won't lose weight. I feel most of these effects may be from medication, but idk tbh.",

Obviously, if something happens that makes me sad, then I'll be sad, but nothing really. My dog makes me happy and do well in a game, but those are just moments out of my day. Most of the time, it is just nothing.",

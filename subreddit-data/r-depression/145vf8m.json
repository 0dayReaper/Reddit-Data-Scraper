(P.S I get ALOT of sunlight on a regular basis but it still don't help)",

Though the world doesn't accept people being miserable if they living a seemingly good life but, it's totally OK for your own sake. \n\nWhat I am saying is don't deny you're depressed. \n You already know what is it like bring miserable so, you can take a step further when you accept what's actually going on..this, can help you understand your misery and hopelessness. \n\nWhen you radically accept something you're struggling with, you find a way to make changes regarding it.",

            "comment": "I understand your struggles, I personally struggle with my own problems in finding purpose and meaning in life. we all seek for a purpose that gives us the will to live and remember that your life is worth living, with time you will find what makes you feel more fulfilled and happier. You have tried self care and have set goals but you still feel empty and purposeless which does not mean something is wrong with you but rather the goals you set are maybe not fulfilling and don\u2019t give you meaning and a sense of purpose. For me when I am depressed I don\u2019t find enjoyment in things anymore and feel like life has become pointless but helping others make me feel better about myself and also gives me meaning and purpose so try helping people and give to others for example through volunteering or just random acts of kindness. If you feel like you are not getting better then get in touch with your GP or a therapist, believe me talking about your problems with other people does wonders and there is no shame in doing so. Stay strong and remember that you are not alone.",

                    "comment": "I agree but also keep in mind that with depression you have a general loss of interest in things. I always used to love painting and love going outside. And recently I\u2019ve been trying to do those things again but I just can\u2019t seem to enjoy them or enjoy them as much. I still feel empty when I take walks, and I still feel pain when I paint. But that doesn\u2019t mean those activities are wrong for me/ not generally fulfilling. \n\nDepression makes it hard to enjoy things but I\u2019ve found that still doing them (if I can muster up the energy) makes me feel a bit more accomplished. And I take pictures when I do. When I look at them it reminds me that even though I\u2019m depressed I can do things and make some sort of memories. Sending love my friend \u2764\ufe0f",

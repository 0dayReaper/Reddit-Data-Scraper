    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been on Effexor for about a year now and I just recently got upped to around 200mg. I\u2019ve missed doses and have had bad withdrawals before, but now that my intake is so much higher than before the withdrawals are hell. \n\nThis quite literally feels like withdrawal from hard substances, to the point where I haven\u2019t been able to move for 3 hours. I\u2019ve been shaking, I\u2019m so dizzy I can barely see, and so nauseous I cannot stand. The vertigo is insane. \n\nI took my dose about 2 hours later than usual, and 2 hours have passed since and the symptoms have not lessened. \n\nAre there any ways I can calm them down so I can actually do productive things today? Please let me know in the comments",

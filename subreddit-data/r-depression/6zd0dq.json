Then one day that darkness lost its comfort, and it felt suffocating. Not because I didn't feel comfortable, but because that comfort from the night was all I had left. Don't let yourself get to that point. As someone else in the comments said, if you find yourself blending into the darkness, seek an alternative, seek help! Therapy can do wonders. Always exhaust all your options before giving up, give yourself at least that much. Therapy has a weird stigma, but do your own research and analyze on your own. I can provide one piece of research but I urge you to search more to see what else you can do to find comfort in look forward to tomorrow instead! If you want to see someones perspective on therapy and how it helped take a look at: https://medium.com/advo/therapy-is-dope-b60a3523e55a\n\nGood luck and I hope everything works out for you. ",

Your body is basically switching on and like a newborn everything feels so raw and intense and it scares you. \n\nPlease know life gets so much easier as you grow up. You look back and wonder why certain things even bothered you. \n\nTrust me. You\u2019re not alone. Just keep going. You sound like you\u2019re scared of death but more so\u2026scared of life. And that\u2019s normal. Just know that everyone you see no matter how great they seem\u2026is also afraid of all the same things\u2026you\u2019re not alone.",

You can do it. Day by day. And trust me\u2026 It gets easier.\n\n18 is tough. I remember it well. Sooooo many mistakes. But honestly\u2026 I barely remember them now. They just FELT like huge problems back then. \n\nBeing young and now old has taught me so much about time. I used to think \u201cI was behind\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m this years old and I should be doing this\u201d\u2026 But that\u2019s just false. You are exactly where you should be. That thought may contradict with what you hoped for or wanted but those thoughts aren\u2019t real. They are just thoughts. You are exactly where you\u2019re supposed to be. \n\nYou have 7 more years till your brain is even fully open. At 25 your brain fully lights up\u2026 it\u2019s been basically \u201crebooting\u201d/ and formatting this whole time. You will see the world and yourself in a new way. \n\nDon\u2019t stress and worry about what\u2019s going to happen. You are powerless to do any different than what you\u2019re going to do. Everything has led to this moment and you cannot chose differently. You cannot go back in time and change your life. So\u2026 don\u2019t worry about it. Go out and be You\u2026 don\u2019t like You? You can change You. Is it easy? Not at all\u2026 it\u2019s extremely difficult\u2026 And worth trying.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m 16 and I have struggled with mental illness my whole life.. i never felt \u201cdepressed\u201d until a couple years ago and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 12. Been on meds since, going to therapy/IOPs/psych wards, and no matter how hard I try, I realize I\u2019ll never be where I wanna be in life. There\u2019s something wrong with me where im lazy and feed into temptations. one of my biggest triggers are my body images issues. im overweight and it makes me so sad yet i don\u2019t have the energy to exercise or eat better no matter how much i talk about it in therapy. eating is a coping skill for me yet it also is like a form of stress because when i eat bad i feel horrible after. I have so many aspirations in life.. I love music and want pursue it as a career.. but i don\u2019t think im good enough or able to make it. i want to move to a big city and travel.. but im 16 and can only do so much. thank god school just ended so now i won\u2019t have to be in that hellhole but that environment is a big trigger for me too.. and im stuck with my toxic ass mom who makes me so sad. it\u2019s just an underlying sadness i have that no matter how great things get, it will always be there.",

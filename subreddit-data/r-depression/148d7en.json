Everyday is like I am more and more convinced in the fact I will not be able to survive in the world of cruelty and fuvked up human nature.\nI can cry and feel sadder just because of words like \"kys\" etc. From random people in internet, I just even stop being a mod in mine own DC server cause of not being able mentally,\nIdk why people are like this,\nBut this question is the same as why they're are murders in this world etc,etc\nSame shit, some wish dead on others,some take others life.\nI don't know.\nI don't know how to win with this hopeless feeling, \nMaybe I should just kill myself, this world is not built for hypersensitive persons like me.\nWhy people can't just built others",

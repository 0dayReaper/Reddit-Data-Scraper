    "postText": "I am sorry if at some point none of this is readable. I'm not doing well nor have I been for a very very long time. I want to cry but I can't, I've cried tears to many times that I just can't seem to cry anymore. I'm writing this at 3:25 am because I can't sleep, I feel like I've been up for 24+ hours. I'm always in pain because of an injury that can't be healed or fixed, my depression is getting worse and I don't know how to fix it. I can't even work a normal job because if I get hurt bad enough I'll be in a wheel chair or worse brain dead for the rest of my life. I just want to go off the grid but I can't. My mom doesn't even make things better she makes stuff worse makes me feel like she never wanted me or my brothers, that we're just a mistake she made in her life. I hate it, I hate the world, I hate everyone and everything........... I hate myself. There's nothing I can do now. I don't even know if I'm backtracking anymore everything feels like it isn't real.",

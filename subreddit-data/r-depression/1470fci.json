    "postText": "Hi all. I have been friends with this girl for 10 years. We both are introverted, home bodied people so we don\u2019t always keep in direct contact with each other. I haven\u2019t hung out with her in person in over a year. She sometimes is not the best at replying to messages and I respect that about her. Anyways, she\u2019s recently been struggling with her mental health majorly. She\u2019s now seeing a psychiatrist, getting to the root of things. As somebody who also struggles with mental health, I feel for her immensely. I told her I\u2019ll treat her to a spa day + massage when she\u2019d like to. It\u2019ll be nice to catch up and unwind mentally and physically together. But what are things friends/family have done for you in times of need that you really appreciated? I don\u2019t expect to \u201cfix\u201d anybody. Just want to be there for her as much as I can while respecting boundaries.",

    "postText": "In short: M25, in Uni since i was 19, changed Uni 2x during that time. Still in my computer science bachelor's (which usually takes 6 semesters, in total i am now in my 12th semester and so far have gathered around 1/3 of the necessary credit points). Throughout that time there was maybe 4 semesters in which i managed to get exactly 0 cp (low discipline, motivation, gaming addiction, self sabotage in general).  \nI've been in therapy for 2 years now, which so far has improved my life noticably, mostly when it comes to self esteem. But i still am at a point where i would say that i am unhappy with my life,and the question is: Should i quit and instead just go into training?  \nIn addition to that i work 20hrs/week from home, which could also add to my dissatisfaction.  \n\n\nSo: Does anyone have experience with quitting something they have put many years into?  \nDid this proactive decision improve the life substantially?",

    "postText": "I have been taken duloxetine for 6 months (90mg a day) and have been on lamotrogine for 7 years (300mg a day).\n\nOn 8 June 2023 my whole field of vision became blurry and oscillates between being blurry and in focus. Usually for about 10 seconds in focus then 30 seconds blurry. This has not stopped at time of posting 48 hours later. \n\nCould this be due to my medications? I have been on them for a long time so we are unsure on why it would start now. I am 22 and have not been experiencing a particularly stressful time before this, in fact duloxetine has been helping a lot.\n\nI can only read and write in small amounts because my vision is blurry the majority of the time. I cannot do my assignments and suspect I won\u2019t be able to work this week unless it stops. It has made me fatigued and have a headache.\n\nThe optometrist says there is nothing physically wrong with my eyes (eg. eye pressure) however notices my pupils do not change in size much meaning I may suddenly be poor at focusing. Generally I am slightly short sighted and wear glasses. The blurred vision happens with or without my glasses on.",

    "postText": "I feel drained but always have more to give. none left for me though. I centered my life around helping others and giving them the love I never had. The love you see in the movies and read about in novels. I figured giving my all to each soul I touched, would get me closer to the one. What I\u2019ve done is allowed for my light to be controlled by others. The need to please, the burning desire to feel an ounce of genuine love. It feels like every time I get closer to reaching it, it\u2019s gone as fast it came. maybe i just have to accept that i am merely a guide for others seeking happiness, never to have my own.",

Not sure its making my happier but I feel less guilty about serving myself and seeking my own pleasure. I've started to develop this f the world mentality, I'm doing what I want. You all can kiss my ass. Cause I don't get the point of pleasing others. They almost never express appreciation and almost never reciprocate it. I mean like never. Maybe god does? Who knows? Most of my service has been disappointing. Even to my own family.",

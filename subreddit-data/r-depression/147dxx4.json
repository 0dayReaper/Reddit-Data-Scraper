    "postText": "I don't know if it has anything to do with my depression. Long before I was diagnosed with MDD, when I see somebody's success, I was not happy for them at all, no matter how close they were to me. Now when I see my friends' achievement, I feel envious. I wish I never saw such.\n\nIt is imposible for me to stop seeing their achievement. My work requires accessing to social media everyday. But every time I go to Facebook, I can see my friends posting what they have done. It makes me feel as if I was the most useless person on earth because I am not doing anything interesting at all.\n\nI hate my friends, as much as I hate myself.",

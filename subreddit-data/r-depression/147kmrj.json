    "postText": "Right now I feel like my whole world is crashing down around me. I'm trapped in a box and no one is listening. \nDoes anyone around me actually know what it's like to be in constant pain, unable to move at times and with no sympathy from the people around them. \nEvery single aspect of my life is falling to shit and I have absolutely no one to talk to about it. \nMy brain just doesn't seem to work like other people's. I find life hard, like going to work, tidying the house and keeping on top of bills, I'm really sure that other people don't find these general day to day tasks so hard. \nMy brain overthinks everything. Every interaction I have with someone will then be over thought for days or weeks after the event. I'm constantly overwhelmed. But just looked upon as lazy and never trying hard enough. \nI'm always the person that is overlooked. If someone needs to be inconvenienced then you can usually guarantee it's me.. I'm always there when people need to talk and need reassurance but then when I ask people to go out of their way for me no one's around and I'm being disrespectful for asking. \nMy confidence is at rock bottom. \nI feel like I've lost my best friend. The person who used to be happy to see me, sexually attracted to me and want to chat about us and how we can make our relationship better but now I just get met with frosty responses and his eyes glued to his phone. When I question it, I'm the person in the wrong and I'm constantly picking at him. If I read this on a reddit post I'd be like girl he's clearly cheating on you get out of there. But because I love him I stay and I genuinely dont think he is cheating on me, I just think he can't be bothered anymore. If he put half as much effort into our relationship that he puts into thinking of a witty response for reddit maybe we would get somewhere. He's just stopped putting effort in, ive noticed and now it's all my fault for nagging him. \nI just don't know what to do anymore.",

            "comment": "\"I'm always the person that is overlooked.\" Never in my life have I read something that resonated with me more. Whether it's with friends or family I feel overlooked all the time. I'm sorry about your experiences with life recently being so hard. I can't even imagine how much it must hurt to be ignored by your partner. If I may ask, what do you want to do? What makes you happy? What life do you envision when you imagine a happy life? Maybe you'll feel better if you think more about yourself and the things you want! In other words, live more for yourself. At the end of the day the only guarantee is that we have ourselves until our end comes. I hope that makes sense to you. Remember, reddit is always here if you need to talk!",

Do you think it's possible your partner is treating you differently due to depression? Does he treat other people differently than he used to as well?",

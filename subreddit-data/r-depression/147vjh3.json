    "postText": "i moved to the city because there\u2019s no real paying jobs in my hometown, or really anywhere to rent, which is a depressing place already. but the city is so so so expensive and the jobs i can get still aren\u2019t paying enough for me to live. i got so depressed i lost my job again and now i\u2019ve been without one for over a month. i was high functioning until i broke down. i\u2019m running out of money that i had spent years and years trying to save up. not to mention, the jobs im qualified for don\u2019t pay you enough where you can afford rent without a roommate. so i live with strangers and it is terrible. i never leave my room because i don\u2019t want to interact with them at all. they\u2019re shitty and i don\u2019t want anything to do with them if i\u2019m being honest. what\u2019s the point in living a life if you can\u2019t even do it on your own? i never had the assets to afford school and i don\u2019t know how to get help. i have no skills and no real drive to do anything at all. i\u2019ve been in therapy but that\u2019s all it is. no meds because they don\u2019t work well with my chemistry unfortunately. friends have become more like acquaintances and i don\u2019t think i exist to them anymore, even more so since i\u2019ve been off socials for years now. they all go their own directions in life, i wish i knew how they knew which way to go because i don\u2019t. and i wish they hadn\u2019t left me behind. there\u2019s no one to reach out to anymore. being 26 with social anxiety is fucking terrible because i\u2019m afraid to get to know people and having depression alongside it is not even caring to. isolated is an understatement. maybe i am just meant to rot alone. i want help but a huge part of me believes i don\u2019t deserve it and that i will never get it. i don\u2019t deserve to be happy because i was always meant to be a hopeless failure.",

My older brother is a lot better now but when he has a relapse, he simply goes on a drinking spree, which is depressing on and in itself. In my mother's case, she just stop doing the basics of a normal household activities that generally do by herself. My younger brother just stays inside his room for the classes because of the Pandemic, but he gets drowned on anime/YouTube/Twitch/Social Networks and stays inside his room more than should be considered healthy.\n\nIn my case, I simply exist. I wake up 5am, stay on bed thinking if I should leave it until 7am, where I need to prep for work in 1 hour. I go to work, open my daily tasks, do it reluctantly because I need it. At the end of the day, I return home, have something to eat if I feel like it, and the cycle repeats itself. Of course I do more stuff amidst what I told about my routine, but I had a real terrible depressed phase where I basically didn't leave the house aside for work, I hardly took more than 2 showers a week, left my beard growing, hair growing, nails without clipping, all in all terrible conditions.\n\nI fight and struggle daily, I wake up exhausted because my mind can't get a rest since I know I've been \"slacking\". It all began when I had a burn out while doing 2 works, University terms, another side course on weekends, and helping out with the family business. My mind screams \"I CAN'T ANY MORE!\", but I have what I call \"lucidity episodes\", where I feel like my older self, I feel invincible, and I can basically accomplish even more than I planned on that day. I try to imprint that image and feeling on myself to remember who I used to be. It is hard, but it helps me to stay afloat and maybe come back from this dark place I've been dwelling for years.",

Even the hope for it to get better IS something worth trying for. Depression is like a really big mess that has been tangled and you don't know where to start but the point is that it can be untangled. First its about accepting that you are in that state and that anything you try any action you take can fail to work. The reason you are trying is because of that hope that it could get better. Then it's about measuring progress each day - progress in the sense of simply documenting what you have done. Sometimes you have to take a basic action to momentarily snap out of it. For example just tapping one hand on the other to distract your mind. That's really the beginning of getting out of it. Of course eventually comes looking at diet, exercise, sleep, stress. As well as any underlying health issues/chemical imbalance or any external reasons to remain in a depressed mood. I often struggled with it because I felt unstable or insecure due to my family/home situation. It sounds strange but nowadays I'm at the point where I can just sit through my depressive episode focusing on the fact that it's short-lived and I don't engage with it causing it to spiral.",

They'll explain how depression keeps them from living a normal life but won't attempt any form of alternative therapy beyond the typical pill regime. If you're at rock bottom, it might help to try something different. Obviously this is a blanket statement. Some people have tried alternative therapies and pills are the only thing that work. I respect the attempt. I don't respect the stubbornness. Instead of grunting at the idea of someone recommending you anything other than pills, um, maybe look into it first. \n\nI have depression and nothing seems to work for me, but at least I tried. The people who sit around all day going hurr durr nothing works while only shoving ssris into their mouth piss me off. People who say, \"you're not depressed so you have no valid suggestions\" (I'm paraphrasing OP) are just as bad.",

The \u201cjust love yourself\u201d line makes my motivation suddenly come back from all the blood boiling I get. Specially because it usually comes from that 20-something guy/gal who can\u2019t stop being right all the time in every life choice (no ill will against anybody. Just stating my experience. I\u2019m glad other people can enjoy life it\u2019s just I cannot and everytime I try reality just punches me back down). Another one of my favourites is \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be alright\u201d. This last one is specially great when they are saying it while glued to their phones texting their SO.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sorry if that was too strong but that kind of behaviour really triggers me because of personal experience",

And because i dont love myself at all, i dont have any energy to focus on things that help me improve my life, or sometimes even wake up in the morning is a burden. Things wont get better automatically, so it's a cycle that i've been trapped in. 1",

Brighter days with lots of sun does help me feel better, but going outside makes me feel my extreme social anxiety, so no ty. I get that a lot anytime I try to open up a bit, I get told is cuz I don't go outside much and get no fresh air... Here depression doesn't \"exist\" as a sickness, people will just roll their eyes and tell you to just shut up with your nonsense, so I never ever told anyone about it, or went to doctors, cuz Im raised where depression isn't a big deal and isn't a sickness..\n\nThere is a saying in my language which means people that ate full have no sympathy for the hungry, which is so true, people that don't feel same have no sympathy and can't comprehend what you feel. Like a girl/boy who is in love with you, but you don't love them back, you aren't wondering what they are doing right now, you don't burn with passion to message them, or meet them, yet they are crazy about you, and you just don't understand their feelings at all (weird example sorry, but I always think about it)..",

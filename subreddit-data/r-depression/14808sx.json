    "postText": "I understand that we all struggle, but bad luck seems to be very interested in me. Not only will things almost always go wrong, but they will do so in the worst way possible. I feel like I pissed off some entity or sometimes wonder if I'm a prisoner of war who is undergoing a realistic simulation where my player actively makes my life as miserable as possible. I'll use what happened last night as an example of how things usually go for me. I had a terrible and long night at work. Things went even worse than usual and I was in a very sad mood because of my depression. While I was suffering, I thought to myself, \"Once this shift is over, I get to go home and talk to my bro while we play games.\" I didn't get my hopes up because life always kicks me in balls one way or the other. My bro and I hop online, we start our first match of the night, and a thunderstorm cuts both of our power out long enough to where we can no longer stay on. I was almost pissed, but I just laughed instead because I knew I couldn't have it any other way. It's just how life goes for me. On the rare moments that I actually need something to happen a certain way, the complete opposite always happens. There isn't enough lube in the world to make this ass fucking enjoyable. I know this could be the depression talking and warping my perspective, but it truly seems like life is just constantly jumping me around every corner at any given moment. I would not doubt if the moment I decide to start living, I receive news that I have some terminal illness.",

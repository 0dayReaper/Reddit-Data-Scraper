    "postText": "I've tried over 40 meds in the last 10 years. I've tried ECT twice in the last year(first round helped only a bit, second round did nothing). I've tried microdosing shrooms. I've tried different therapies, group therapies as well. Support groups. Walks, jogging, watching series, reading.\nAnd recently I'm trying ketamine. I took it 7 times in doses from 30mg to 180mg. Nothing helps and there is no hope for me. I don't have energy to fight this. There's nothing left to try and I don't even have energy to try. I won't have any money left in 3 months when nothing changes. And there's no sign that ANYTHING will change. Sometimes I regret I didn't kill myself when all this started.\nI don't have energy to take shower, I brush my teeth every other day. I lie in bed all day, I smoke tons of cigarettes, I eat a lot of sweets. \n And my heart breaks once again every single day when I realize I can't live, I can't feel, I can't be happy, I can't do hobbies, I can't go shopping, I can't read etc etc.\nAnd there is no hope, no salvage.",

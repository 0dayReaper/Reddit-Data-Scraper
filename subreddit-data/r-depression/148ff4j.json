    "postText": "I used to be very close with my father as in we would do things often together when I was younger, once i became an adult my father (43) and I (F19) had a strained relationship, it started when I was 17 he stopped answering my messages, I don't know why but it would send me into a swing of sadness and it made a wave of depression hit me hard. Now that I'm 19 I try to speak to him when I'm upset and he won't reply, so I'll text him again and he will tell me \"it is not my job to emotionally support you\". It's so upsetting because I've always been there for my dad through so many emotional things but he can't be there for me.",

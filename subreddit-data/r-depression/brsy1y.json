Not qualified to diagnose this at all but I do recognize what you are saying(really motivated followed by a crash) in my pattern of moods and I have bipolar disorder type 2. Or it could just be ups and downs of depression and normal state.",

I've never had highly motivated periods for months at a time, only really for a few days. Most days are somewhere in the middle or on a slight downer, which makes me inclined to buy into the theory of fluctuating between depression and normality.\n\nBut it is interesting you mention this, because I myself have noticed how rapidly my mood can change. Literally a few days ago I felt pretty good about myself and like nothing could bother me, but these last 24 hours I've felt so down and crippled and have had this evil feeling of self hatred.",

I have had these weird periods in my life where I've just felt *bulletproof* for a while, only to crash after. I have severe lows and when I get a slight positive in my life, I just get exhilarated for a burst. Like I'm loaded up with rocket fuel instead of ordinary gas. I hope that's an understandable metaphor... I have been depressed for well over a decade now and have started to think that I might be so used to feeling like shit that I barely notice it. But when something moderately good happens and I don't feel like crap, I get kind of manic or what you would call it. I can actually feel it a bit now. Maybe it's because I'm relating to you people in this threat here and it feels a bit less lonely to have this specific struggle. I barely do anything to entertain myself nowadays and just drift this site all day since I lost my job in the beginning of 2018. I have had periods of playing some games on my computer, but it usually quickly fades.   \n\n\nSorry for the long comment. It felt good to write about at least.",

When I asked him, since he does not do evaluations but have been talking to patients for decades, he was leaning towards highly functioning autistic. I will get a neurological evaluation eventually. But it could be years away so all I can do is speculate in the meanwhile. His colleague has started doing some tests to try and root out if there are any other diagnoses that might fit on me, since there are possibly more than one. That guy actually works with doing evaluations, just not the neurological one that a special team in my country does. That's the reason for the long ques for that specific kind of evaluation. And healthcare is free where I live, which is nice. But it also adds to the ques a bunch... It kinda drains my motivation to just wait around for some actual answers about who I am and how I work. My reasoning being that I might stop pondering it all the time if I had a clue about why I'm like this.",

I honestly was hoping for a dx of bipolar so I knew I wasn't just crazy but you're right the symptoms don't match. I've talked about it with the psychiatrist. She was considering it too but the big thing about bd is disregard for self. You take risk, spend all your money, do things you don't usually do etc. I personally never do that. I just feel good and motivated. So after going over it for a while my psychiatrist explained that these moments of happiness before are crash are me cycling into what is considered \"normal \". Since we're so depressed our normal is altered. So when we reach this threshold of normalcy to us it feels our of place. Which is even more depressing, knowing that's what normal people feel everyday imo. But yeah I hope that was even a bit enlightening",

Even people who are depressed can experience highs and lows but that doesn't necessarily make you bipolar.",

I used to think it was just how normal people feel like all the time, but I realized that I would be a little extra anxious than normal. I'd sweat more, think/ talk a little faster, and be more shaky/ jumpy not like major huge differences but enough. But like idk I'm not a doctor or going into that profession and only have the knowledge that I have as a patient so... just saying. Anyways I'm on the same meds as I was when i was diagnosed with depression but there are mood stabilizers you can take with like your antidepressant. Idk if you're on anything or what and I'm not saying you should be at all but yea just adding my 2 bits an just rambling now so yea.",

Your relationship with your Dad is not gone, it\u2019s just transformed, and grief is a bumpy ride ...be patient with yourself. There will be times when the world will feel upside down and other times when it feels okay. In time, it will smooth over, but you won\u2019t forget. Also, that\u2019s horrible about the bullies. What they do is a reflection of them, not you. You are hurting and they are frightened of this and can\u2019t handle it, or they are just cruel. Is there someone you can talk to at the school? Please let someone know this is happening. In the meantime, I hope you are okay, and know that it gets better.",

I've experienced this myself and have been diagnosed with bipolar 2, though I don't know if I actually have it. \n\nWhat helps me is gabapentin, which helps the crippling anxiety that causes the depression.\n\nSecondly, forming good habits and sticking to them no matter how you feel has been essential for me. One such habit, or routine that I have that helps is walking atleast a few miles a day. I walk to work which is a mile and a half away, then work requires walking due duties in my store.\n\nThird, I listen to audio books about positive things during my walks. Things such as how to be more effective at something I'm interested in, which in my case is being more healthy. The subtle art of not giving a f*ck and how to win friends and influence others were my starters, for instance.\n\nMaking habits and routines has been helpful, makes me feel more accomplished and they, in my case, help change my perspective of things in a positive manner.",

At first you will succumb but later with more experience you will build discipline that will beat it. You might still have a shitty mindset but with the help of discipline you'll make tremendous progress that months before that you wouldn't even imagine would happen. And yet still, even after all that, you will feel like shit, but when looking into the eyes of progress, you'll understand how deceptive depression is, feel better and keep pushing. \n\nThat's how the cycle always plays for me.

I just feel so out tune these days, I have no idea what I\u2019m doing with my life. Although that\u2019s something that some of feel as well, not knowing what their purpose in life is, I do believe that it gets better. Eventually. It\u2019s just hard.",

Then I try to study even harder at home, realise I can't concentrate and I'm shit at the subject and then go into a period where I just don't give a shit whether or not I do well. I used to be a really high-scoring student but now I just don't care anymore. Today, like 10 minutes ago, was the 4th year where everybody in my class won an achievement or certificate except yours truly. I've honestly just given up now.",

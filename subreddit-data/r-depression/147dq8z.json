    "postText": "Today was terrible. I feel so alone and invisible. I express myself so well and I share how I feel often. I try to enact boundaries but no one seems to listen to me. Yet, I feel others want me to be open and receptive to their emotions. I even got told that someone was disappointed in my want to sleep instead of do work. Which hurt so much because I was vulnerable about being very depressed and unmotivated. I felt like I got a slap in the face. I try so hard to be attentive for others but I don\u2019t receive it back. \n\nI\u2019m so hurt today and I honestly just wanted company and a hug but I couldn\u2019t even get that. I feel that I can never have anything and that nothing is meant for me. On top of this I\u2019m trying to find motivation to finish my thesis and then move to a new place. I\u2019m working 2-3 jobs and I just want rest and support. It\u2019s so hard. I just wanna give up. So badly. I really wanna die today. I really don\u2019t wanna live right now. \n\nThis always happens and nothing ever changes so why keep going. It\u2019s always something. Stress over school or money or relationships.. I just wanna be at peace man. It\u2019s so hard and I don\u2019t feel like anyone is listening. I feel I just get more backlash for me trying to live or feel. What\u2019s the point in this anyway.",

            "comment": "Hey, I\u2019m sorry you had a shitty day. You do deserve a break. Working 3 jobs while managing a social life, friends, and school, not to mention other stressors like money and family. It\u2019s so much. I\u2019m sorry you couldn\u2019t get the break you deserve today. It is good that you express yourself, that\u2019s a really positive trait and I hope you\u2019re able to hold onto it. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s totally normal to want to sleep and not work. Idk why someone said they are disappointed about that? That\u2019s a super weird thing to say, because I mean who doesn\u2019t just wanna take a break? Don\u2019t feel ashamed for wanting to sleep or need a break. And don\u2019t let someone make you feel bad about yourself for needing a break.\n\n\nI hope tomorrow is a better day for you, you deserve a good day \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAre you close to finishing your thesis? What is it about?",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nso I\u2019m just here to vent about my feelings right now\u2026 I feel deeply hurt and I start to hate myself so much. I don\u2019t have a diagnose but I think it might be depression. My boyfriend of one year has cheated on me kinda multiple times but I can\u2019t leave him because I\u2019m emotionally dependent on him. I only start feeling happiness when I\u2019m with him and I\u2019m craving those endorphins and the only way to feel happy for me is being with him even though he is super toxic and makes me cry a lot. We\u2019re in a long distance relationship and when we\u2019re apart he mostly hurts me, when we\u2019re together I feel happy.\n\nother than that, I feel extremely lost in life after I\u2019ve finished high school. I started a major and gave up on it again and I don\u2019t know what my life even is right now.\n\nI also struggled with my mom being an alcoholic before and me being raped by my own grandpa.\n\nLately I\u2019m feeling hopeless and like life is meaningless and stupid. I feel like nobody cares about me and I\u2019m making their life harder because I\u2019m too lazy to do anything and my family gets mad at me. I keep canceling plans with my friends and they tell me they feel hurt by it. I\u2019m just a failure making others life hard. My parents and friends constantly worry about me but they have their own life problems, they don\u2019t need mine.\n\nMy friends are still great and understanding but they don\u2019t stay consistent with being there for me. Maybe they shouldn\u2019t be here for me anyway. But my boyfriend prioritizes other things over my feelings too.\n\nthe weird thing is that my best friends boyfriend is trying to help me by sending me motivational messages and telling me that I can talk to him anytime. I feel thankful for that because nobody makes me feel cared for that much but also I feel weird about it because I can\u2019t get too emotionally vulnerable with my besties bf. It would make me a horrible person if I develop feelings for him. I hate even thinking about this.\n\nI started pinching my skin very hardly because of all the self hatred and I punch myself when I look in the mirror.\n\nI get jealous of other peoples lives and the things they have that I don\u2019t have. I feel so ungrateful. Other people have worse lives, why am I like this??\n\nif anyone read this, thank you. I appreciate it.",

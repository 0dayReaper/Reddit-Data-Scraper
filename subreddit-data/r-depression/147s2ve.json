    "postText": "When everything is about to be destroyed , everything you put your hearth in to it ,sadness and pain arise,\nI Never wanted anything to myself because i never felt that i needed something,but when for the first time ever of my entire existence i taste hapiness ,i have to let it go ,\nAll my efforts everything i have ,After years of fighting against something i can't even see i still dont have the right to be happy ,they said War is for us to find peace ,but this War dont want to stop ,it still killing me everyday ,and i can't take it anymore ,i can't live like this ,i tried my best,but it still nothing ,no one can help me ,and no one undestand ,i hoped for the best but got the worst,\nAnd you know what ? I tried to please everybody using myself as a sacrifice ,but they treat me like im villain a criminal ,i dont even know who i'm ,what i'm ,the onlything i know it ,that i'm not who i want to be ,and i dont have what i want to have ,\nI do not hope,i do not wish ,i just suffer ,\nI Became my own enemie ,my own sickness,\nWar without peace ,have no sens,\nI Hope everyone to never Come across this pain ,\nI really hope no one have to Lost his reason to live.",

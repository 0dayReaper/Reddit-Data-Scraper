I can\u2019t even get a hug when I\u2019m crying.\n\nI have plans (not to be discussed in this sub) but not the necessary means, so I\u2019m still around.\n\nI feel my meds need to be adjusted, but that will happen at least in a couple of months. And my life will have radically changed one way or the other.\n\nI just want to scream into the void that I\u2019m not ok and I don\u2019t know what to do without being a burden to anyone in particular. I\u2019m just not ok.",

    "postText": "Dear all,\n\nI have been depressed for most of my life. I believe it began from a very young age at school, where I was regularly on the receiving end of racist comments and ridicule. This I believe trained me to accept that I was out of the ordinary and would never be included or accepted. From then onwards, as I got older I began to see the disaster relationship between my mum and dad, their constant fighting, violence towards each other, my dad's drinking, and my mother's over spending which fuelled the anger and resentment between them. I was also beaten badly at school several times, with concussions. I did make friends as a young lad, and regularly met with friends and used to do recreational activities such as skateboarding, swimming, football. I did also get girlfriends somehow, most of the time they came on to me, I never actually went out of my way to start any of those kind of relationships, I just accepted them when they presented themselves.\n\nI have a college education in IT, and did that job for 3 years, where I was miserable all the time. Essentially all I was doing was sitting at a desk fixing things that should not need to be fixed if things were setup correctly in the first place. I ended up leaving this career, and doing driving jobs instead.\n\nAround the same time of this in 2010, I met my now ex wife, who was originally from Norway, and moved to England to be with me. This went on very well for 4 years, and when we got married, the depression hit the hardest. I think looking back now, it was because of her. I was always striving to keep the house in order and the money coming in, to not be a failure of a partner / husband, where she did pretty much nothing financially to help. It was always me doing all the work. But na\u00efve as I was, I believed that this is how marriages are and to just roll with it.\n\nIn 2017 we had our first child, and in 2020 our second. By the time it was 2022 summer, after I expressed my despair and anger due to having been living with kidney stones for 6 months, and 2 stents shoved inside me, and her always demanding sex despite this, she told me she was done and wanted a divorce. I asked her what would make her the happiest and she said she wants to go back to Norway to live close to her dad and extended family with the kids. I thought at the time it was a good idea for the kids, so I agreed to it stupidly and let her go in December 2022.\n\nAround the same time of her divorce demand, I was trying to train to be a Class 1 HGV driver (for Americans that's CDL A i think). I got the licence in the middle of the separation but still cohabiting with her and the kids until December 2022.\n\nI am still doing this job now, where I tramp across the country all week and go back to my parents' house on weekends. I no longer own anything, no house, no furniture. Just my clothes, couple of bags to put them in, a laptop, phone, headset is all I have.\n\nReason I wrote all that, is I am looking for some advice or answers from older people, even elderly people in their 70s, who may have gone through similar things. The question as the title says, does it ever end? Will happiness and content with myself and life in general ever come? I am very tired of my life and I am only 36. It has been nothing but negative situations over and over, and I just want it to stop.\n\nI am medicated, but I am still itching to just buy a licence free firearm here and just end it myself. Either that or jump off the highest point of the Severn Bridge connecting England and Wales.\n\nPeople always say that things will get better, that it's temporary... well, how long exactly? I have been miserable most of my whole life. My recent loss of my kids has destroyed what I was meant to be for the rest of my life. The ex wife leaving me out of the blue has destroyed any trust for women, I doubt I will ever have a relationship ever again because of her.\n\nWhy not just end it all now? Can any older people without doubt look back on their life and say that they are so glad they did not kill themselves at a particular point? If so why? What was so good that made it worth living for?\n\nBecause I cannot for the life of me see anything worth living for.",

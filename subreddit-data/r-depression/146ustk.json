We can take anything you want to lay down.\n\nCan you honestly not think of anything else besides self-harm? A change in scenery usually helps me with unwanted thoughts, or routine physical activity, or doing something I enjoy. Failing that, escapism works very well for me during times of crisis. Would any of these things help you?\n\nIf you need to get some inpatient help, that is nothing to be ashamed of.",

Problem is when i'm not working I have nothing to do. My life IS my work, and it's honestly depressing. I'm good at my job but that's it. When I go home I go to bed, it's not like I need to do things because I have already done them! It's worse on days off! I went for a four hour walk earlier from 7-11 and before 12 I had already maxed out what to do for the day, straight to bed.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGuy on reddit in desperate need of help",

I don't really have any hobbies and not for want of trying, the ones I do occasionally indulge (say swimming or walking the countryside for example) only last a few hours and i'm back in the same situation. Probably one of the reasons this post has gone here and not elsewhere, wanting to do something but lack of interest to do so.",

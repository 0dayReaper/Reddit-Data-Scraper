    "postText": "I have been depressed for some time now. I'm mostly at home bacause I don't have where to go or even if I have I don't have someone to go with. I have no one to talk to about how I feel. I have two friends which I barely see and even when I do i can't talk to them because they don't understand me. I go to therapy but it doesn't seem to help very much.\n\nRecently I watched a video of Chester Bennington where he talked about how he felt and I related to that so much which made me afraid. What if how I feel becomes so much of a burden that I end up like him?\n\nI know I'm still young and supposedly I have \"so much to live for\" but I don't live, I just exist. I'm just the side character in people's stories. I know that there are people with worse life than mine but I'm afraid that my life is going to get worse to the point where I wouldn't be able to bear it anymore.",

            "comment": "Being told how you feel is one of the worst things. When you are that young people think they know you, they think you are just exaggerating or maybe you do that for attention. I felt that way that's why I know what you are talking about. \nIt doesn't matter if you are autistic or not, if you've been through hard times that's probably gonna leave a scar. But it doesn't mean that you wont be able to heal that scar. I'm sure you will find a way to deal with this, maybe it will be through therapy, maybe you will meet people, friends, who will help you or maybe you will figure this out on your own. \n\nI don't think you have ran out of options, because one of the options that you had is to write here, where people will understand you and give you advice or at least support. The second option which I think is the best is to go to therapy. I know how it can be expensive and maybe you will have to convince you parents (or whoever it is that you live with) to let you go to therapy, but trust me it will pay off. \n\nMy advice to you would be, don't label it. I don't say that you are not depressed, I believe you, but if you are anything like me you might make the depression something that defines you, so you won't be able to see the good things around you or the things that might help you or make you happy.\nFind anything that makes you feel at least a little happy and stick to it. Doesn't matter what it is. If you don't have something like that find a will to look for that and you will find that.",

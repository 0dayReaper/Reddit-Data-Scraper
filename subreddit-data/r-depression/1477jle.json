    "postText": "I'm struggling a lot at this moment. I take care of my mom, besides work, and it's been so hard. I'm currently having thoughts of unalive myself, because it's really hard to keep going like this.\n\nShe is the kind of person who keeps on taking and taking and taking. I try to understand, but km on my fucking breaking point.\n\nI can't even buy me a game for my birthday, because she wants me to give her more money. do you know how much things I got for myself this year? Nothing! nothing because I have to think of her!!! \n\nI'm.so fucking done with everything. \n\nThe cats are the only reason I'm still her because they need me, and nobody would take care of them.\n\nI fucking hate this life. Fuck everything.",

I can't say I would trust anyone else to take care of them either so far.\n\nSorry to hear your mother treats you like this, I do hope you find some respite and get yourself something too. It's important to find something to distract yourself from the bad thoughts.",

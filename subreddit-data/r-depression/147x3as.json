    "postText": "Has anyone used one of those online websites to get an ESA note for housing so you can bring your animal with you for housing that doesn\u2019t accept pets? We\u2019re getting evicted, and having to research on where to live on top of 99% of places not accepting pets has me so beyond depressed past my normal depression and anxiety it is insane. Every website claims it\u2019s the true legit one and I want to pull my hair out. I\u2019m already fucking depressed enough let alone going through all of this and having 3 weeks before we\u2019re homeless on top of it. Please help with recommendations, if you can.",

    "postText": "I've been kinda struggling with this for awhile now. As you've read by the title, I have no energy or motivation to clean my room. It always bothers me how messy it is. Even if I finally have the energy for it it just ends up messy in less than a week and if it isn't messy there's something really unsatisfying about it. Maybe I'm just lazy, but I would hope not.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading.",

And you may not feel energetic because of it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have a theory - it's called \"mind clutter manifestation theory\"...\n\nSince your thoughts are all cluttered, it manifests in the environment. This way, you'll react with your feelings - and your feelings will tell you that something is not right...\n\nBut you don't listen to your feelings, you're just thinking, and more clutter appear.\n\nCan't do anything about your thoughts, but you can clean your room. \n\nIt's not actually that you don't have the energy to clean your room, you don't have the energy to confront your thoughts or feelings because you feel bad about yourself (I'm lazy...)\n\nBut that is counter-intuitive - you feel bad about yourself already, not because you're lazy if you don't do this or that... That is a choice, not a feeling ;)\n\nWhen you have cleaned your room, you'll feel better about yourself, and your environment will feel spacey so that you can process better what other problems you are facing in life which lead to you feeling bad about yourself - by comparison to others - in what you want.",

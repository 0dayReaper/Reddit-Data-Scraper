            "comment": "How to end the fact that you hate your life? That's a tough question. \n\nFirst step, in my experience, is let go of those unwanted thoughts. We didn't choose to be here, correct. But here we are anyways. Might as well try to make the best of it. And yes, we fail. We fail so hard, over and over and over. But then, we got to get back up and try again. Because the alternatives are dumb.\n\nPain can be a useful teacher, if we let it. But do we really DESERVE to be hurt, to be in pain? I used to think so. Not so much any more. Nor do I think do you deserve to be in pain. Perhaps it will help you to think of this pain as something that you have to feel sometimes, but it isn't going to be the only thing you feel. With some time and effort, it can be something you feel less and less.\n\nI know you're scared. So am I. Its okay to be afraid: self-murder is shitty option.",

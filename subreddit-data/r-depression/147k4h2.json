    "postText": "I look at myself now, and wonder where it all went wrong. From having friends and a normal social life, to having no one. Each day is harder than the last, and the inner thoughts are getting more and more tempting. Every time I\u2019m driving I always think about driving full speed until I hit something hard enough that it kills me. I wish I could go back to how it used to be, even if I didn\u2019t have great friends, at least I could play games with them to distract myself from this never ending pain. I\u2019m 22, and I can\u2019t see myself even making it to 30.",

There are small victories in between it that keep me going, even if it is just living long enough to see a movie that you wanted to see that\u2019s years out. I think society has taken a very drastic, shitty turn lately, so don\u2019t blame yourself.",

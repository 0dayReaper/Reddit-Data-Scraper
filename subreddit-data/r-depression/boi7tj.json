The first thing I did was make my bed, and that\u2019s a victory in my book. \n\nI love you all.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the Silver, and for the heartwarming comments. It means a lot!\n\nEdit 2: This has me all kinds of emotional. I\u2019ve never had so much faith in the kindness of strangers.",

The dark cloud, weight on your shoulders, prison cell inside your mind, whatever you want to call it, just... wasn't there anymore. Immediately experiencing a rush of contentment and peacefulness, that for most people, comes naturally. \n\nIm so incredibly fascinated with that idea, because it just seems so foreign, so unreal to me. \n\nI can in a sense understand why to the average person, \"today I woke up, and I didn't feel like dying!\" Does not seem like a huge accomplishment. But I'm sure the people here understand.\n\nGives me some hope that maybe some day will be my day. :) so so happy for you!",

It may seem insignificant, but each little \"win\" like this is actually incredibly important and REALLY will help with your mood, exhaustedness, and outlook on life/yourself a little more every time you achieve another little \"win\". \n\nPositivity my friend, is mostly (not all) in the mind. If you can get yourself in a positive mindset, things will only improve from there. Trust me, I know, I know just how each day can be. Hell, even just sitting up and forcing yourself out of your bed can seem like a battle of life or death (I've been there man...). But I promise you, from experience, it helps so much with everything and you feel so much better if you just FORCE yourself to do it. And after you get outta bed, FORCE yourself to get a shower, FORCE getting dressed and cleaned up, FORCE yourself to down breakfast etc. With each task that you make your body progress with, you will feel better and better as you move forward I swear to you.\n\nHang in there OP, remember that you DO matter. You ARE loved, you ARE important, and (very important) you WILL be missed if you were gone. It's not worth it man, life's hard (even without something like Depression), but there's so much beauty and good in life that makes the challenging times all the worthwhile. The easy way out is never the answer, EVER. You're better than that man, you don't need to quit...don't you remember? You're a MFing BEAST bro! You'll make life's obstacles your God Damn BITCH! All you gotta do is press onward and TRY and you will grab life by it's tiny (compared to your huge ones BEAST) nuts, rip those miniscule  lil nuggets off life's crotch, and crush those bitch balls beneath the fuckin IRON PLATED heel of your boots! Get the fuck up and go make life, your schoolwork, your job, your wellbeing etc. your MFing BITCH LIKE A BEAST CAN AND SHOULD! DEPRESSION HAS NO CONTROL OVER A BEAST LIKE YOU! ITS PLAYING BS MENTAL GAMES BRAH! YOUR THE ONE IN CONTROL NOT THAT LIL BITCH ASS POLESMOKER THAT IS DEPRESSION! IT'S YOUR BITCH, TREAT IT LIKE ONE YOU FUCKING LEGENDARY BADASS BEASTMODE SUPER SAIYAN WARRIOR OF UNPARALLELED MIGHT AND POWER!!! YEAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!",

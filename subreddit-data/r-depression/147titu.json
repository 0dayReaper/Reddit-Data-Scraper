She told me that she would rather spend 48 hours giving birth again than deal with more tooth pain. There were times nerves got exposed and I would go into a cold sweat for 2-3 days at a time waiting for the antibiotics to kick in. the pain is so bad that even vicodin would barely alleviate any pain. Tooth pain the worst, I wouldn't wish it on anyone really, not even my worst enemy. I lost all sorts of time at work just to sit in hot showers trying to numb the pain. also now I can hardly eat anything hard at all. I can't even bite into an apple with how sensitive my teeth are. Strongly suggest taking care of your teeth or saving up to just get dentures without the losing all your teeth part. I've had all sorts of injuries in life, tooth pain the worst.",

Surprisingly, this actually worked for me. I rarely brushed my teeth as a kid until about the age of 14/15. \n\nA decade later and I'm not perfect at brushing but my mouth starts to feel uncomfortable after 3 days of not brushing. Last time I saw the dentist they complimented my teeth (for the first time ever lol) after missing my prior appointments.",

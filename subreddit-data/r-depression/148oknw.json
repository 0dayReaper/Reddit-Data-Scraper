You really need to find someone to help you, because like you said, it's way too hard to help yourself when you've sunken that far. Please try to talk to someone you trust like a family member, close friend, pastor (etc.) and tell them what's going on.  I know it can be hard to open up about this subject even to people you're close to, but you have to try. ..Or if you have the means and willpower to make an appointment with a therapist or a doctor who can prescribe medication (and actually get yourself to the appointment when it's time), then go ahead and do that. Don't put it off because it sounds like you're only going to sink further if you do nothing.\n\nAt one point in my life I had lost all hope and was feeling pretty desperate, but thankfully my mother helped me find a doctor and I eventually got on a medication that helped me turn my life around. I don't think I could have done it without her, though. \n\n\"Look for the helpers,\" as Mr. Rogers would say. :) ..There is someone out there who cares about you and can help.

Sertraline (\"Zoloft\") is the one that worked for me, but I tried several before it that did absolutely nothing. With most antidepressants, you have to stay on them for a few weeks before you know if they're working, so it can be frustrating. ..But if she doesn't respond to her current meds after that waiting period, then I would go ahead and try a different one.\n\nEven though the numerous therapists I saw weren't able to help that much, I think it was still reassuring to see that we were trying to do something to remedy the situation, and to know that my mom would keep helping me try different treatments until we found something that worked. So please just make sure your daughter knows that you will never give up on her and that you will continue helping her try different therapies, meds, etc., until she finally finds one that helps. Reassure her that there _is_ a solution and if she hangs in there a little longer, she'll surely find it. Depression is one of the most common ailments today and we now have dozens of good ways to treat it. It's only a matter of finding the right one for her. With your help and little persistence she will surely get through this!",

Something that doesn\u2019t require much effort to begin but will force a reaction once started. After this, focus on NO rumination. (If you are unfamiliar with the meaning, look it up, it\u2019s the single most important word for people with depression to understand.) Keep your mind as blank as possible and go through the motions of health living. You will need to FORCE yourself out of your comfort zone for a prescribed amount of time. (Usually one to two weeks for me.) If it feels wrong, run towards it. Eg: If your natural tendency is isolation, meet a friend for coffee. If you want to sleep, make an appointment that requires to be up by 0600. \n\nOf course\u2026 Therapy. Possibly medication. Longterm coping strategies. Etc. Ect.

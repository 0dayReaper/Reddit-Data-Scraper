    "postText": "Ive been feeling like theres no things in this world that would interest me . Nothing at all.\nNothing entertains me or makes me feel happy.\nIm always sad and ive been like this for more than 6 months.Feeling like the life is meaningless and there's no point of me spending any more time in this world. I think the world would be better off without me.\n\nSometimes i cry for no reason .\n\nEverytime when i go to a place thats may be overcrowded with people such as a mall ,i watch happy people talk ,laugh ,discussing things they like and being  happy.And thats when i realize how miserable i am.It makes me feel sick.\n\nI lost the ability to talk to people.I dont know how to be a part of society.I dont how to be myself. I dont know what i realy look like and how i would act like. I dont know if theres \" the real me \" somewhere . I dont know if i still exist as an independent person with independent personality.\n\nAll is left from the person that i used to be is just memory.\n\nIm tired of being sad.",

I\u2019m so alone right now I can\u2019t think of anything else. I have no one to spend time with. The only comfort I have is escapism I no longer fully enjoy eating away my life and time. Goddamn I really wanna relapse into SH right now. I spend time with no one IRL anymore, I could at least pretend like I had people via Reddit interactions but this is the blackout week. I can\u2019t take it anymore I feel like I\u2019m going insane like I have no one to talk to except some words on a screen I feel like crying this has been going on for so long things don\u2019t change I can\u2019t fucking do it I can\u2019t fucking do it",

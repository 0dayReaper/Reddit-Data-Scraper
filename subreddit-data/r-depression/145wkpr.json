But it is still hard.\n\nI need a kind stranger who would send me hugs *hugs* . \n\nI don't want to talk with my family and friends about my problems. I want a contract with someone who cares just enough to send a one line answer.\n\nPlease notice me.",

Literally. \n\nShe told me to put each arm around my body, crosing them around my body. She made me do there in front of her, she repeated on herself, saying that she knows it sounds and looks silly, but with day by day, every time I needed a hug,if I do that, It wouldn't be silly anymore. \n\nSo I hope you do that to yourself. Don't wait for someone else to hug you. Give yourself that hug and human comfort you need.",

    "postText": "F20 my whole life my mom was a very active alcoholic from when I was 5 to 19 I have a little brother that I took care of when our mom would black out I made him food ,bathed him cleaned the house ,played with him but still he is my moms favorite until this day,cause \u201cshe almost aborted him\u201d due to her finding out my dad cheated a dozen times on her during her pregnancy so he always got extra good treatment and because of me he never rly noticed how much of an alcoholic my mom was which I am happy for but it just changes the both of us so much he\u2019s a completely different person with completely different values than me,he\u2019s what I maybe could\u2019ve been if I wasn\u2019t born the oldest but oh well \nI\u2019ve \u201cstruggled\u201d(aka willingly took them because it was fun)with substances since I was 15 from drinking to weed to E to codeine to \u2026\u2026.. a few more thinks I\u2019ve tried out I\u2019ve skipped school cause we were homeless twice and those times rly changed me as a human my brother went to his friends house who\u2019s dad conveniently was my moms new boyfriend but I moved in to my grandparents place with my mom and my grandparents never had a clean house because my grandma is mentally ill due to my grandpa beating her and just my family is fucked..and the house always smelled and it was dirty and she peed everywhere and I started skipping school cause my clothes smelled and I didn\u2019t feel clean enough to go and then my grades dropped and skipping became an active problem in my life I started cutting myself while I was there too but just before our house got evicted I got a little cat that rly helped me through everything long story short he\u2019s now gone too cause he died after leaving the house (he was a house cat never leaving the house ) and he ran on the street and got hit by a car and my mom was the one who left the door open\u2026 well yeah so basically I live in Germany I don\u2019t have a proper degree because of all the skipping and the most frustrating part about it is that my grades have never been an issue it was just always the skipping that made me fail I\u2019ve transferred to many different schools 5 in total and now I got kicked out again for skipping the reason behind it is a whole story in it\u2019s self but now I\u2019m left with nothing again wasting year after year of my life and I can\u2019t seem to get better I\u2019ve tried therapy with 17 but they just wanted to put me in a hospital during a time where I couldn\u2019t leave my house then again with 18 but my therapist was shit now I\u2019m 20 I am insecure to the max I hate every single part of my body and face I never leave the house I haven\u2019t had a single real friend in over 4 years and the loneliness is rly getting to me I\u2019m at a low again where it feels like there is no out it\u2019s always a repeating cycle my therapist wanted me to go to an asylum so they could determine whether or not I have BPD and there\u2019s just so much going on in my head and i can\u2019t get up and get myself to do anything and it\u2019s causing issues at home I smoke weed everyday and I\u2019m starting to think it has rly done some damage to my conscience I just don\u2019t feel the same I wish I had a time like other humans that I\u2019d like to go back to but frankly my life has always been horrible lmao there is no past i can reminiscent\nAnd wanna go back to i just rly desperately want to feel genuine happiness and a life without is rly getting to me now idk what to do I\u2019m out of options out of will out of want and just out of power to do anything anymore \nHope you enjoyed a very quick lil run through of my life theres a lot more detail that has made it even more of a shit hole but maybe I\u2019ll keep those for another time if there is one my friends :) see ya \nXoxo stranger from Berlin",

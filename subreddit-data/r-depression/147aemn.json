I am constantly made to feel wrong.. and everyone I live with knows I suffer from depression among other things. But still get made to feel not enough. They know of (old) SH, and my attempt, yet it\u2019s brushed off\u2026 I go to therapy, but so far I\u2019ve only been once (second round soon) but I feel like I\u2019m fighting alone, and that it\u2019s pointless to try to stay above the water when nothing is ever enough. I saw more worry from my mother when my brother was going through the same stuff, and I\u2019ve told her I\u2019m at that point but I\u2019m blown off\u2026 what do I do? What\u2019s the point if no one cares (I have a fianc\u00e9e but he\u2019s normally too busy and has he\u2019s own depression I have to help him with)",

    "postText": "Everytime i go to a public place such as a beach ,a park or a mall i just start feeling hopeless. I sit on a bench and watch them(people) ,they talk and laugh ,theyre having a good time unlike me.Many people are always rushing ,cause they got people they care about and people that care about them.They got things that make them happy .\n\nIt just makes me feel hopeless .Im never gonna be like them.\n\nSometimes when i see couples ,i compare myself to them and the only idea that comes to my mind is that im not good enough.I hate myself.\n\nAnd everytime someone tries to talk to me i just ignore them for no reason. Seems like the only person that i talk to is me. Seems like i dont even know how to talk to people,how to be a part of society.\n\nAt school ,during the break i would sit on a bench in the yard and stare in to the sky thinking about killing myself.I dont do anything useful. The world would be better off without me.\n\nI dont get any enjoyment out of life.",

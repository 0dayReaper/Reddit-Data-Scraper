    "postText": "In the rare moments when I am actually feeling good, I often realize just how blank this feeling is. It feels like there is no real depth to it. Each time you are happy, it feels very similar. It feels like it is no going to impact you. But when you are truly sad or devastetad, it feels meaningful. You can literally feel how it slowly changes you and I am not saying that it is a good change, but it is a change. It also feels like it is going to stay with you forever when happiness is transitory.  \n\n\nEdit: I have no idea why I wrote \"happyness\" in the title. ",

As in, to be content with the life you have now.\n\nAnd if you're not content, it's up to you to decide whether you're ready to withstand the spikes of depression plunging ever deeper into your soul upon enduring a nightmarish crucible of change.",

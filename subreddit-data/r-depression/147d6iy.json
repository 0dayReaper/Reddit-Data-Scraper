    "postText": "That\u2019s pretty much how I always feel. Sometimes it\u2019s a little less or more each day but those two adjectives always feel like they suit me. I\u2019ve tried so many different skills and hobbies, and I start to get good enough to the point where I see how bad I am. I did this with drawing, chess, video games, piano, you name it. I feel like I genuinely just have less talent than many of my peers, and just not enough drive for any one thing to be great. I\u2019m a complete loser with little to no friends and the inability to connect with anyone without them seemingly immediately sensing I\u2019m a loser. I don\u2019t get it. I try so hard. I finally found something I loved a year ago (piano) and put my all into it. I thought I was pretty good all things considered. But how fucking naive I am to think I\u2019m not garbage because I posted a video of me playing and I immediately got comments shitting on how bad I am. Someone even said in the first note they \u201cmentally checked out\u201d. I really thought this was the one thing I had a knack for, but no. After a year of hard work and effort, I get told I\u2019m shit. This has just made me want to stop trying, because whenever I do it just ends in failure. I try to make meaningful connections, I get ghosted. I try to learn the piano, I\u2019m shit. I try to do well in school, I burn out halfway through and get a measly grade. Sometimes I wish I met someone who just saw me in the light I couldn\u2019t see myself in, but I\u2019m starting to think the reason I haven\u2019t met that person is because there isn\u2019t that in me to appreciate in the first place. It hurts",

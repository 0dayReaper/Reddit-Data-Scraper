It really helped to numb the pain and sent me to a different, though empty, headspace. As one might expect, it only made things worse in the long run, nevertheless when trying to quit it feels like you're trying to leave behind the only thing that makes life bearable, as you say. I started to drink somewhat heavily in the past six months and the hangovers just got worse and worse. I started to have this horrible suicidal thoughts the days after I got hammered, which started to be almost everyday. It became an awful cycle of evasion and confrontation of the things I was feeling. And like every cycle at one point just stopped, but I don't know how for long. A few days ago I drank again for the first time in like 3-4 weeks and I just kept thinking to myself \"If I could just feel like this all the time without consequences I'd definitely do it\". I'm not going to try to give you any advice or telling you that you should quit because I think depression and substance abuse go hand in hand, and you can't solve one without solving the other, and because I'm not completely sober myself neither and I understand you. But I think that there's a very significant difference between saying \"Scotch doesn't make life worth living\" instead of \"Scotch is the only thing that makes life worth living\" and that difference is hope I think, hope for something better, and I truly hope you get better. Don't know if this was of any help, but anyway I know how you're feeling and I hope you find worth in living soon.",

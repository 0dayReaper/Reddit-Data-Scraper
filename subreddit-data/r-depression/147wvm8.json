    "postText": "I hate my life. I hate my family for being controlling and treating me like shit even though I never needed to live with them. They called me, they asked me to move in with them. I didn\u2019t need their help.\n\nI hate hate I moved to another state and they can brag about high income bs but there\u2019s like no resources out here. The libraries and parks are a joke. There\u2019s no where to go and meet people . the suburbs are so lonely and isolated like everyone here is that friend that ditched you because they have a boyfriend. \n\nI hate people telling me I\u2019ll figure it out. I hate people telling me I\u2019m resilient. Everyone just doesn\u2019t even want to talk to me. Everybody just fucks off. They\u2019d hang out with me if I had nothing but money to just shop and go to red restaurants and never mentioned any problem I had and I can\u2019t do that.   \n\n\nI wish I could just finally die. I hate my life. I think what really set me off was yet another job I applied to I got denied because I don\u2019t have a masters. Wtf kind of admin job needs a masters? Then Their going on about how everything is filled and they post jobs once a year and it freaked me out. How am I supposed to get my life back like this?\n\nIm just going to be treated like shit, poor, and probably homeless forever. I wish that bmw ran me over",

            "comment": "An admin job that needs a masters? That's so frustratingly ridiculous. Ugh. I get that it freaked you out though when you just want to get your life back. Of course you do. What would the world be like if people, even sometimes just stopped to think about how ridiculous and controlling and shallow the things they did were?",

            "comment": "That's the catch 22. Parents usually act in the best interest of their kids, but it's only what **THEY** think is best. So they try to direct you towards that, by trying to convince you and talk to you about it as much as possible. What they don't realize is they are only thinking from their perspective. You have got to do what is best for you, it might take some time, but you won't spend most of your life living like this. Don't compare yourself to what others have or where they are at because they started from a different starting line. And sometimes they get cheered on, and sometimes they don't, and of course there will be the commentators, pointing out every flaw and trying to predict their future. There will be the judges, but what the judges fail to realize is the runners are running trying to break their own records, not what the highest score possible is. You're still running in your lane, you might have some people in the crowd booing you, there might be some commentators, and there are definitely judges, but you need to realize that you're not running alone.",

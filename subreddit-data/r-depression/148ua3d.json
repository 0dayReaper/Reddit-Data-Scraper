I\u2019ve  learned and made photography, art, editing, animation, music and now I\u2019m about to submerge myself into boxing. I\u2019m so far removed from myself, and I think to myself why do I do this? Is it because I\u2019m so depressed that I need this amount of activity to keep myself distracted? Do I just keep going hoping I\u2019ll be myself again? I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. My brain is in pieces, my soul is lost, my spirit still burns but for what? And my body is slowly going. All that remains true is my heart, not knowing where it\u2019s going but just believing. I feel like I\u2019m on drugs 24/7 without taking any. It begs the question, who am I? What am I doing? Why am I still going? Will I ever get back to normal?",

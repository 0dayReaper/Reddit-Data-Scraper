    "postText": "In my experience I have found that the expression \u201creach out if you ever need to talk about something\u201d is not a genuinely heartfelt statement. Those who express their support for people that they know to have depression or other such mental health difficulties tend to fall into one of three camps:\n\n1.) They mean it when they say it however when reached out to they are made uncomfortable by the topic matter discussed and consequently react adversely. This can be expressed by distancing from the person experiencing the issue, making light of the situation, or otherwise finding ways to avoid the gravity of the issue. \n\n2.) There are also those who say the aforementioned statement and believe that they care however in practice don\u2019t. Saying a comforting phrase and being a shoulder to cry on are two different things and these people simply grow tired of the burden of caring. \n\n3.) There are also on occasion people who are willing to be a shoulder to cry on however cannot properly relate to the long timescale of depressive disorders. At a certain point they begin to be bothered by what they see as a lack of progress and their empathy will run dry. \n\nAdmittedly these are generalizations and outliers do exist, however on the whole it seems that people either don\u2019t care, cannot empathize in a useful capacity, or are not mentally equipped to help a friend in need; these altogether make me feel that to reach out is to invite onto myself more problems than I already had. \n\nNow I prefer not to hold beliefs without hearing contrary points of view, hence why I am posting here. The big question I would like to pose is in effect: to what effect is it useful to reach out, if at all? \n\nPlease do not make unfounded generalizations common to the mental health dialogue when answering the above question. We have all heard the stock phrases of \u201cthere are people that care\u201d or the occasional \u201ca real friend would hear you out\u201d, I am skeptical of such generalizations and would prefer concise reasoning. \n\nThank you all for reading and peace be upon you, please comment below if there are any answers to the above question of utility of reaching out.",

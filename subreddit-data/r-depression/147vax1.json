    "postText": "After a yearlong stint of my body and my mind at war, I had a couple days where I felt happy and light. I felt like things were getting better and I was so close. So close. \n\nThen, I got a call in the middle of the night, my mother was on cardiac arrest and no one knows what happened. \n\nStrike 1 for grief, loss of a person I only ever gave love to and of the person who never paid attention to me. The loss of the person I was constantly scraping up off the ground after my sister hurt her time and time again, I was the one who kept her going. Made sure she was safe. I lost her because of my sister, I never got to have the mom I needed. \n\nAfter I orchestrated her funeral, after I did all the paperwork, after I was out of the way and was the best daughter for my entire life. What did my mother leave for us? A life insurance policy with only my sister\u2019s name on it. \n\nMy sister, who only ever took and took, she bled my mom dry and now is selling her for parts, galavanting around town in a new car and still putting herself first every time. My sister who abused my mom, physically and emotionally, her entire life. My sister who has said the nastiest things to her; refused my mother help at her lowest; the one who introduced her to the drug that eventually killed her. Why does she get to win this too? Didn\u2019t she already take enough from me? I wish it was about the money, but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s about the way the world should work. \n\nMy sister continues as is, no one has stopped her, but we\u2019ve tried. She\u2019s my villain, my foe, she took things from me I didn\u2019t know could be taken. She\u2019s a leech. 27 years old, 5th baby on the way, (4-5 baby daddies, 1 dead, 1 deported, others abusers) didn\u2019t even have a bank account until last week. Why the fuck is she on this policy? I wish I had a better answer. She\u2019s supposed to give my bother and I our cuts, but I really can\u2019t imagine she will. Waiting to see. Being nice so not to set her off. \n\nWhy does she get reprieve? When I\u2019ve been grieving and still going, still graduating fucking college without my mom to see. Strike 2, no more school. \n\nI had one thing keeping me going: I got my dream job. Everything felt good and bright. They announced layoffs last week. Strike 3. Suddenly, it was a Thursday afternoon and I had nothing left. \n\nI haven\u2019t stopped crying for days. I\u2019ve only ever worked hard, only ever took care of everyone, and the world just likes to keep reminding me that I\u2019m not worth it. \n\nMy friends are trying to be optimistic; their optimism is met with hypocrisy. They talk about how bad the job market is, but then they say they\u2019re sure I\u2019ll find something. But I might not. I know I won\u2019t find a team like that again. No one understands me and no one wants me around. Anything new I start, the people will learn to hate me. That\u2019s always happened except at the dream job. I\u2019m never getting that again. I\u2019m too weird, too much. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do with myself. I feel so hollow. I feel like I\u2019ve been robbed and left for dead. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s left of me.",

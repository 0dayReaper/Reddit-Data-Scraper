    "postText": "This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more;\n\n- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people\n\n- severely reduced attention span\n\n- short term memory loss\n\n- severely reduced motivation\n\nI think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. \n\nGetting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months. I can barely even talk to people in my classes now, they seem so competent and on top of things while I'm just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence.",

I used to be able to watch a TV show or movie and care about it, now I have to pause ever 15 or 30 minutes and wait, watching a show or film can take me all day, I just can't bring myself to give a shit about pretend. I loved to read, I read a book a week or more from 8 until 32 years old. For the next 4 years of depression I read 5 books. \n\nAnd in the last 2 years of recovery and therapy things have improved, but more in other ways, now its still only a book every 2 months, wildly different than most of my life. I never did social media at all before I got on Reddit less than 2 years ago, not of any kind. Reddit is different, I still don't do anything else, and I do like it here and the people I have met, but I do notice I am on here 3 to 6 hours every day. I feel like I am coasting intellectually on things I already learned, ideas I already formed, philosophy I already believed, and more than anything thoughts I have already thought. \n\nThis is the thing that is most for me, I am articulate and well read enough, with enough evidence based and fully formed opinions, that I can appear intelligent in all likelihood forever. But that is not the point. Intellect is nothing if one does not grow, does not learn and change, does not reach. It is improving with therapy and such, but in truth it is quite slow. The memory, concentration and motivation issues are incredibly frustrating, it bothers me because I want it and am trying hard, yet redeveloping it is proving so difficult. I wish I had answers besides continuing to move forward and to keep trying things, keeping those that prove effective over time. But its really irritating in truth, I can empathize a great deal.",

But mainly it is all about fighting to regain sovereignity over your own mind. It is trying to play tricks on you and drag you down, but you have to keep fighting even if it feels a lot like boxing with shadows sometimes and can be so insanely frustrating.\n\nMost important for me was understanding and admitting that it was things I did that led to the poor situation. It is not about assigning blame (this is important - more about this in a second) , but rather taking responsibility. Because if it was your own weakness that got you to this point it can be your own strengh that pulls you out. You cant change the past but you can change the future.\n\nVery important: while I say you have to take resposibility for getting into this situation it is not about beating yourself up for it. What happened happened and you had your reasons for acting like you did. It doesnt have to be something big, like getting abused or some big excuse. From an \"objective\" point of view I had everything one could wish for and my brain still tricked me into getting dragged into depression. It's not my fault. But it would be my fault now, after I understood that i have choices to make and not making the right ones.\n\nI have never actually tried to write this out. I hope it makes sense and I hope it helps, if only a littlebit.\n\nEdit: spelling\nContext btw: 26m and depressed since my oldest memories, slowly regaining my mind since almost 2 years",

So much in fact I did better then most, even though i have dyslexia. When my depression started at the end of primary school though. I started to read much less. Eventually books got harder, and I barely improved my reading. I eventually stopped reading all together. If I try to read a book now I'll lose what is going on and what I just read in just a page. I'll  have to read the entire book basically 5 or 6 times because I need to re read every sentence multiple times. I still have a very good vocabulary from all the rDing I did. I just dont have the attention span i need. It's also not at all enjoyable to read in this method so that's why I dont. The only way I'll read something now is with the help of an audiobooks. Just let that play while reading along. That works for me. I dont do that a lot either though.",

Example: I have a job interview next week for a full time position (that's another story in and of itself, I doubt my depression will permit me to work full time) and I know I need to prepare but my mind just gets flooded with panic and I \"numb out\" with food and online shopping.\n\nI'm not really living, just existing.",

This, in my opinion, is slowly resulting into me becoming a version that lacks depth and personality because even if there is a version that is remotely rich in details, it is the version that I am not willing to share with the world and even those close to me. In the end, I don't even know how to partake in conversations with people. Either I am not interested or I am anxious to provide any details because I am paranoid that any actual small truth will lead to the real me.

Here's how I did it. I set up some routines to make sure I always get the basics (food, sleep, hygiene, exercise) done. For example, once i wake up, i brush my teeth, and then i eat a breakfast of oats and banana and egg. Same deal every day. I kept pushing myself to do this, no matter what time i woke up, how shitty i felt, or if i had missed the day before. Just keep chugging along. As for sleep, once I got the breakfast routine down, I starting working on getting a regular sleep schedule. And once that was mostly done, I worked on going for a short walk every night. Just keep building yourself up, and slowly you'll find life is a lot easier to deal with :) and your cognitive capabilities do comr back, I oromise.

However I\u2019ve found that using it every other day (instead of daily) or going off if for a while resets my tolerance to a healthy, manageable dosing requirement.\n\nAGAIN\u2014THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE.\n\nThis is advice to CONSULT A MENTAL HEALTH MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL and discuss whether or not this might be worth a try for you specifically.\n\nWe\u2019re all fighting some version of this and this is simply one move that\u2019s helped me outmaneuver Depression enough to get control over a chunk of my day.\n\nGood luck to you all and keep sharing what you\u2019ve found helpful.\u270a\ud83c\udffc",

And based on your user name I\u2019m concerned you might get a dark journey. However, I\u2019m no expert in psychedelics so just a thought.\n\nLots of trials/studies have been done using LSD, Ecstasy, and Ketamine and it\u2019s possible you could track down clinical trial. But if you\u2019ve been hesitant to try an antidepressant or other meds, I\u2019d definitely encourage you to start there. Learning how your brain works under the influence of chemicals is probably best done in baby steps where you\u2019re dense of control isn\u2019t compromised as severely as something like LSD demands.\n\nGlad your inspired to talk to your doc about options. Taking the reigns and trying new things in a methodical, measured approach is a great way to start feeling like you have some control and options over something that otherwise just feels like a mountain on top of you. \n\nKeep us posted on how it goes. \u270a\ud83c\udffc",

And what if neither of those things is a result of your conscious mind?  Maybe our conscious thinking can't control everything in our lives, despite our ego wanting desperately to believe that.   Hmmmm ...\n\nModern medicine tells us that body chemistry is the root cause of depression, and medication is the immediate indicator for correcting that.  The latest science is now correlating many mental disorders to imbalances in intestinal microflora, including *dementia* and *Alzheimer's*.  There is now some correlation between the gut biome and *anxiety*.  Humans that have too little or too much of specific digestive bacteria are prone to many mental health disorders.\n\nWhat if your intestinal state is causing both your depression and decline (or the feeling of congnitive decline?",

There is signs that SOME depressions may be linked to it.  Not depression (in general and all of it) is linked to it.  There are many, many causes of depression which is one reason why it is so hard to research and treat.  For example, for a while people were touting \"The inflammation model is it! It's the solution and the chemical imbalance model is wrong and outdated! Eat your tumeric and throw out your anti-depressants!\"  When the data showed only like 1/3 of people with depression had elevated cytokines, and even then there was only correlation.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Data is far from showing causality and a mechanism of action.

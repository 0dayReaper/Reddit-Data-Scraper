I don\u2019t wanna quit but I\u2019m just so tired of struggling with life. \nThe house where you live is supposed to make you feel comfortable and you\u2019re supposed to look forward coming home but I don\u2019t. It\u2019s the place where the people I love (despite treating me poorly) hurt me the most",

It's horrible that you don't have a home and that the people inside aren't there for how you need them to be. I know it is exhausting and often seems endless or pointless but I hope you keep struggling. I hope you have a goal of getting out and away from that house. Getting somewhere you feel loved and comfortable and being able to be the best you that you can possibly be.\n\nI too have a shell I'm trying to turn to a home. It takes its toll and I feel overwhelmed often. For what's it's worth know you're accepted here Internet friend.",

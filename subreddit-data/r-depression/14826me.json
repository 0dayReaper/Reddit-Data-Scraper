    "postText": "I'm 27 and my life is so shit. I have no friends and I'm single, people say I'm pretty and it hurts. I can't make friends and I struggle to get a boyfriend because I have social anxiety and when I meet people they come and go. I don't know if it's me or I meet the wrong people, I'm so picky that I won't hang out with just anyone.\n\nI hate where I live but I have no choice being in a town of tourists which makes it harder to meet people and theres no point being friends with people that are going leave and that I'll not meet anyone in this town, I've tried dating apps but no luck with them. I'm stuck living at home because I have nowhere to go and I can't afford to move out. \n\nI feel like I've wasted my life away because I haven't had friends or boyfriend to enjoy life with while I'm young and make memories too and I literally have no memories, I've rarely done anything with my life as people my age or younger have traveled and settled down while I still need to sort my life out and still yet to travel.\n\nI didn't get a job until I was 26 and I couldn't get a job for years that I've spent my life being poor and now I can't keep a job I've been turned away from all of them as I was fired and then I see them jobs looking for people to hire again, I feel so replaceable and unwanted like I don't belong anywhere. All the bosses didn't want me and I was working hard and doing well at the jobs, I make a mistake and I'm out. I'm quitting the next job I get before they quit me. \n\nI have no education and I have no qualifications and my education got messed up when I moved to Spain when I was 15 and went to school where I didn't know the language. I'm so tired of Spain as I been in spain 12 years now I've outgrown the country but I'm trapped in spain and can't get out of this situation that I've been in this position for years, nothing ever works out for me and that I'm unlucky in life. I'm never satisfied with anything as I'm not doing what I really want than making the best of the bad circumstances. My family are so boring they never want to do anything and I feel like I'm stuck living their life since I can't get a life of my own.\n\nI'm looking into volunteering around the world as it will be opportunities to travel and get away as I feel suffocated being in the same fucking place for weeks and months on end that I need a break and be somewhere distant to the point I wouldn't come back.\n\nI'm going to take antidepressants to put me in a better mindset to sort myself out as I know its so hard to do anything when I'm depressed, I'm unmotivated most of the time that I don't feel like doing anything. I've tried to feel better exercising but whatever I do doesn't work and I tried therapy but she recommended I volunteer which she said would be good for me.",

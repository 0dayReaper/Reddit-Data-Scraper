    "postText": "about 2 weeks ago i had the worse anxiety-depression-panic episode of my life at work. i just felt despair and agony, and it was hard to breathe, my heart was so fast and I really thought about throwing myself through the window to make it stop. luckily enough i had a telemedicine appointment with a new psychiatrist who gave me an sos medication for when things get bad. it helped on that day and some others, but now i feel tense everyday, afraid that it will happen again. i wake up in the morning and i\u2019m feeling tense, thinking how can i get through one more day. i really think i lost the will to go on, i\u2019m always afraid it will happen again. \non top of that i\u2019m having a really bad existencial crises too. i just keep thinking what\u2019s the point of life, why bad things happen to good people. i\u2019m really tired of living like this and every time i have a crisis it seems i never got back to \u201cnormal\u201d, it seems every crisis take a little bit of my hope and will to live.",

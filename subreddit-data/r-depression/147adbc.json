As 3 seizures victim, from the moment I start convulsing till waking up from the seizure, there's nothing. No ego. No consciousness. You just like you feel it to the other people, but you don't feel shit when convulsing, it's like you are dead.\n\nAlso there's no happy life, just happy moments, so I agree with you, too much work for such a little reward. But most normies don't have to make such philosophical thoughts or dark thoughts or their good working brain doesn't let em feel depression.\n\nThat's why I believe earth is the actual hell the religions talk about. We committed sins in our past life forms, and karma punishes us. If not, what we did to get punished so bad ? My life is like living in an isolation cell, I see it is getting rapidly worse, so the addictions just to feel a bit normal.",

But there are about 1% (maybe less) who really LOVE life and live in a state of almost permanent happiness. I can confirm and bear witness to what I am saying because I personally know at least one of those lucky ones, he is a friend of mine, and like him there are other people I have met in my life, and I was not born yesterday... I am almost 50 years old. I wanna say that for me and you, \"normality\" is sadness and suffering, and exception is a few moments of happines, whereas for some rare people, enjoying life is normality with few moments of sadness and some moments of great happiness and satisfaction.",

Talking non stop, laughing, joking, wanting to do stuff all the time, but he passed away a couple months ago after a cardiac arrest. My depression worsened and keeps worsening since then, I developed heartburn or stomach ulcers from the anxiety. Never ever in my life had this. I wake up with heartburn or whatever it is and crippling anxiety that I'm scared sleeping in first place.\n\nAnd the brief moments of happiness I have are not even real, it's artificial happiness, or better to say emotionally numbed and very content with my very shitty life as long as the pill works. I can't eat, haven't showered in 3 weeks.",

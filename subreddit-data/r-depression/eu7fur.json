But for now, maybe you can gently tell your friends how you feel; that you're overlooked and you just want to be seen, truly seen, and appreciated. That's not much to ask from friends. There has to be give and take in any relationship. I do know it's hard to start a conversation like that though.

I hope you get better and hopefully never have to go through this routine depression takes us through. im dragging myself out of my bed to draw, eat, or study. I feel so shitty and feel like overdosing, but I want to drag myself out that shitty mindset because there are other **strong** people trying to kick this mental illness.",

Today I'm pretty much fine, probably because of it and those thoughts making me see everything reasonable. It might sound like bs to some of you but it also might help somebody else so I will share it here, even though I hate talking about stuff like this. \nThe thoughts are, you're at a point in life where you are in constant pain. Taking your life might change that, but you won't know. In anyway you will hurt people, even though you might think you're worth nothing to them, you're. You taking your life will destroy others, so is your life worth more then theirs? \nBut moreover there is one thought that helped me, you have to think life currently sucks, but it might change. If you take your life right now, you just wasted a possible opportunity. There is no chance to go back. Life is currently like a film starting of very bad, but if you keep watching it, it might be your favourite one. But how can you find out if you don't watch it? You have to suffer a bit (i know it's a lot!) now, but if you fight until it gets better, you might think one day that it was worth it. And if it doesn't change, you wasted a bit of your ethernal time, which isn't much of a sacrifice. In anyway, fighting will make you stronger (believe me I got all my self esteem and strength because of this). And life is not about being always happy and having everything as you want it to, it's about trying to become a better person with every day you spend on earth. \nAnd you're a currently at a point where you have nothing left to loose, why don't try working with that, you're not really afraid of death, so why should you be afraid about anything? Just live life, without fear. Make the best of it and think of every day as an opportunity. \nBut most importantly talk to your parents/ family/ friends/ professional help and tell them everything, I know it's the hardest thing to admit weakness. It takes the most strength to do so. But just think that you were about to commit suicide, what have you left to lose? Just try it.",

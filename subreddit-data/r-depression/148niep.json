I'm a college drop out and I don't have any skills so I'll probably continue to scrub toilets until I can retire. So how do you get any motivation to do anything? I can't even wash one dish or cup. I started taking Effexor last month which has helped with anxiety and a little with my depression but I still feel like meh :/",

What are your skillls, what are the jobs you would be willing to do (broaden your horizons) bc there are a ton of jobs rn. I do security, easy job, and knowing that I\u2019m building for something is enough. Knowing that one person usually more I will make smile during the day keeps me going.",

I'm not sure what kind of job I'd like to do but probably something with little to no human interaction. Also I'm in a rural area so it's not the easiest to find a job.",

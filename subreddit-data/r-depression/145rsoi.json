    "postText": "I am genuinely so paranoid of starting Zoloft\u2026 I definitely need it I definitely have depression and anxiety, I\u2019m just so scared of me losing my creativity \n\nIf I can\u2019t draw I can\u2019t be me. My art is my personality, it\u2019s the most important thing to me in my life, if I lose everything I\u2019ll at least have my art. \n\nI\u2019m just scared Zoloft might take that away from me, I\u2019m crying at the thought, but I know this is definitely anxiety and this med is made to help shit like this\n\nAre the side effects permanent!? I don\u2019t wanna lose my artistic skill forever if I lose it on the meds\u2026",

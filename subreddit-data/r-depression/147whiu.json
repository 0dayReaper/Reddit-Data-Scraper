    "postText": "Over the last couple years, ive started to lose the ability to anticipate my future. I used to be so excited to plan my life, sit and research careers, look up financial ideas. But now, as a 15 year old, Ive lost it. I dont care about anything anymore, some people think its some act to seem cool, but im genuinely unfazed by everything. My grades suck,  my body sucks, my life in general sucks. But the most I can muster out is \"so?\". I no longer fear death. I fear the act of dying, as that would be painful, but not waking up doesnt seem that bad. People say i never reach out for help, but when i do, they act as if theyve done me a huge favor by even tolerating my being. I dont think im making it past senior year",

            "comment": "For me, it became easier to tolerate reactions of other people when I realized that everyone is just super advanced animals- they have their own wants and needs, and are indifferent as to who they get them from, how they get it, and where. As such, their opinions are only relevant under a very specific context. Even my own parents and little brother are no exceptions to this rule.\n\nThis makes it easy for me to detach from the expectations of others and be okay with who I am and what I do, even when I inevitably make bad decisions. I am my own person, and I will ensure the world recognizes this. And only then can I step towards the future.",

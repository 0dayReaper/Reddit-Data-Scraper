    "postText": "Hi, im obviously depressed and have almost killed myself countless times. Ive been living in a hotel for 2 weeks planning to kill myself here, away from anyone i know. The thing that stops me is the thought of hurting my friends. I went to a hospital for help once but the environment/doctors just made me feel even more depressed and trapped. I have been really scared to go to the hospital since last time it just put me in a worse place. Now i know that i have to go because otherwise im certain ill just kill myself. Im writing this so that my decision can become relatively real and so i am more likely to hold myself to it. Thank you for reading and i sincerely hope that everyone in this subreddit overcomes their depression, no matter how impossible or pointless it may seem. Good luck to everyone",

I will reach out to one friend per day...\u201d Being measured allows you to see progress. If you admit yourself into a hospital like mine, in Ohio, you can\u2019t just check yourself out. You can\u2019t leave on a dime. Everything is safety proofed and locked. A doctor is the only person that can admit you. BE NICE, to everyone, to best of your ability. Stay out of drama on the unit. BE SELFISH if you have too, you\u2019re there to gain insights and to acquire useful coping skills. You will gain a routine. Do all the programming you can, it\u2019s why you\u2019re there. You will be uncomfortable. You will be tested, but that\u2019s why you\u2019re in a controlled environment. Avoid antipsychotic meds if you can (side effects). ASK THE STAFF FOR HELP. And realize that most of the staff that is there, has been through what you\u2019re going through (with the understanding of a general experience, not your experience itself). They also might be a bit apathetic, due to all the shit they see/hear everything. Don\u2019t pack a lot of stuff.

About an hour later, one of my friends who is in that same group chat called me and broke the news. We knew he had been struggling with depression for a long time but it never got to the point where it was visibly affecting his way of life. He was working full time at a Best Buy, got promoted to manager, was going to nursing school and making great process and even started clinicals. Everyone had reached out to him at least once in the past year asking him how he was doing. \"Hey man, just checking on ya. How are you holding up? I'm always here for you if you need someone to talk to.\" he was always in high spirits and always told us he was hanging in there and taking it one day at a time. His funeral was yesterday. I never knew he has touched so many people's hearts. So many people cared about him and came to pay respects and especially to support his wonderful mother.\n\nI don't know what you are going through in life or what the cause/root of your depression may be (if there is one), but I can tell you this... If the only thing keeping you alive is your friends, the please talk to them. Unashamedly and genuinely open up to them, share with them exactly how you are feeling and the thoughts in your head and tell them that suicide has been a serious consideration of yours for a while now. \n\nThe group that he sent the text to (which has been known as the Little Sausages for nearly 10 years now) has 15 of my nearest and dearest friends in life. He joke around, roast each other, talk sports, video games and basically anything that anyone feels like bringing up.  When the news of our friends death had spread and everyone knew... that was the first time I had ever seen every single one of my friends crushed to the soul. Grown ass men crying like babies. Once we came around to being able to talk rationally about it all, everyone was trying to figure out what went wrong, what could we have done differently. Everyone started blaming themselves for not seeing it coming or doing enough to help avoid it. I felt numb. I remember laying on my couch crying until I didn't even realize I had stopped but instead realized I has silently been staring at my ceiling for over an hour. \n\nLife is so precious. I can't imagine the pain you feel or struggles you go through on a day to day basis. But be brave! I'm so happy to know you are giving yourself a chance and putting energy towards another day. Have courage to talk to your friends too. Doctors don't always help, like you mentioned with your first experience with them. Hopefully this time is different! But at the end of the day, no doctor will love or care about you the way your friends do.",

Second, you've taken action to try to alter that in spite of how much it costs you in the moment. Third, you're holding yourself accountable by voicing it, which might seem obvious or unnecessary but is hugely important.  \n\nThis is not going to be a joy ride, I think you're already experiencing that and you know it too. It doesn't immediately get better once we want it to stop hurting. But it *can*, and that possibility is infinitely more possible than what the bloody body down the cliff can have. The hike is long and the body and soul are tired, but you *can* do it, and there's no amount of dirt and steep slopes you haven't already experienced if you were at the edge of life already.

The second one I went to after my suicidal cycle repeated was A LOT better, I met some good people and got some help. I\u2019m still struggling with my mental health a lot but I\u2019m doing better at coping with it and a big reason for that was my second hospital experience.

Then, when you have a free day, do as many things on that list as you want! But don\u2019t stress yourself, trying to do everything if the list is big (that would make everything worse) and you don\u2019t have to go on to a strict schedule, you can just do whatever you want. If you have extra you could do them on a different day. I hope this helps!",

He was still in a shit place mentally, this was a month or so after. his mom made him switch psychiatrists who then took him off of a med he has been on since a young child for seizures/ mood stabilization almost cold turkey which sent him into medically induced severe psychosis. This made his already abusive parents abuse him even more, he got back to his og psyc who fixed everything med wise, he got out of psychosis and made a year long recovery to being in a decent spot with his depression. \n\nHe says one of the biggest things that held him together was his job and being around his coworkers even though they later admitted to him that they were kinda scared of him and wernt fans of him at first because they had no clue about him having the psychosis when he first started. \n\nHe said his dog also helped a lot too he served as a wonderful ESA, he always was there to offer some comfort in his darkest hours. I was also his only friend (girlfriend at the time but we don\u2019t have a typical relationship, we are literary best friends) and he said I was the reason he didn\u2019t go through with anything because I actually showed that I cared. \n\nWork can bring you amazing friends along with the structure and distraction you need to pull yourself out of hard times. \nI do agree it shouldn\u2019t be any cost to receive this help but it is and we can\u2019t do anything about it so might as well find a way to turn it into somthing that\u2019s ok to deal with.",

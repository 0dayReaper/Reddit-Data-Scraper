    "postText": "I\u2019m sat here staring at the ceiling just thinking what\u2019s the point. Everything I do to make my life different or interesting or better just ends up in it being turned for the worse and every day is just the same it\u2019s just like what\u2019s the point. Nothing I used to do has any appeal to me anymore it doesn\u2019t bring me the same joy it used to and the friends I have usually bring more negativity than joy. My life\u2019s just a cycle of the same things over and over and it\u2019s always bad day after bad day I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m meant to do , I\u2019m still fairly young and nothing about waiting for life continue appeals to me anymore. There\u2019s jobs I\u2019d like to do and places I\u2019d like to go but the constant days of regret and sadness just leave me every night wishing that things were over and I didn\u2019t have to continuously repeat my life when it\u2019s never good. The worst part is I have nobody to vent about this to , my old best friend became toxic and so we stopped speaking and my trust in others isn\u2019t what it used to be so everything\u2019s just kept inside bottled away. I wish I could start my life over and just life in one peaceful place not moving all the time just actually able to enjoy life. I\u2019m not sure if anyone will see this let alone read it all but if you do thanks and just someone to talk to is good",

Just feels good after.\n\nAlso cook yourself a decent meal, pick a recipe you\u2019ve not tried before maybe but sounds super fuckin tasty - food goes straight to the soul, and you\u2019ll feel amazing for actually just getting off your ass and fuelling yourself. Bonus dopamine - getting the dishes done too, now that\u2019s a top teir feeling of achievement",

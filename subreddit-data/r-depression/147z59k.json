    "postText": "\ni have very bad introception, especially with feelings. i\u2019ll feel anxious or any other feeling, usually negative feelings are difficult, but not know why. i won\u2019t know where it came from and sometimes i just don\u2019t know what i\u2019m feeling at all. whenever i answer those mental health questionnaires, i check off a lot of the d\u2019espion symptoms, but i don\u2019t know if i am and i don\u2019t know if my emotions are just \u201cflat.\u201d i have a hard time feeling really anything, but that could just be because i\u2019m autistic? maybe? i\u2019m already on 2 medications and considering anxiety medication that helps ocd too. i\u2019m not diagnosed with that, but looking at the symptoms i really think i have it. \n\nit\u2019s not like a \u201coh i\u2019m so organized and clean, i must have ocd!!\u201d it\u2019s \u201cthese irrational constant fears and my compulsions to try and make them go away are seriously affecting my life and stressing me out.\u201d i don\u2019t want to say i need anxiety medication for ocd which i\u2019m not diagnosed for and gad which i am actually diagnosed and then think maybe i need depression medication. i\u2019m very worried about what the doctor will think and might think\u2026 i don\u2019t even know, but just refuse them and think i\u2019m being being paranoid or trying to get medications i know i don\u2019t need or something like that. any advice?",

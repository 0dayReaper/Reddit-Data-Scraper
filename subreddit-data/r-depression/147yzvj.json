    "postText": "Honestly nothing more than the title. I'm Just sitting here crying because the situation hit me basically out of nowwhere. I've finally been diagnosed with adhd in my mid twenties and am now medicated, i'm also on several antidepressants so you'd think i'd be okay, but no. I've gone through a tough breakup that i cannot really process yet since it's basically ongoing as Well as a friendship breakup with my main support Network. My ex treated me so horrible that it reminded me of my abusive ex at Times and my friends literally went from simply disliking my Partner to accusing me of being a facist and sending me literal hatemail. I have to move Appartments because i feel so unsafe with These people having my Adresse that i constantly have Panic attacks and Well noone wants me as a roommate because i Lack the ability to read social cues possibly due to my neurodivergancy. \n\nIt's Just been a lot honestly. I Wish i Had a therapist but waiting times are insane in my country so i'll have to wait until the end of the year probably. I could really just use some Kind wird's. I haven't been this down in years and it's bringing Back alot of Trauma from years of bullying... \n\nI feel isolated and misunderstood. I hope someone Here relates a little, i don't want to feel Like a Freak anymore",

    "postText": "23m- I'm so damn used to thinking negatively and breaking myself down but in a weird way its kind of a \"comfort\" thing where caring about myself is so foreign that I don't understand it and the idea of having self love or self respect (for myself) repulses me. I just feel like a whoopsie daisy fuckup and this is just kinda how things are. Ive felt this way from a young age.\n\nI don't know how not to beat myself up but when I do it's me being able to feel something familiar and tho people misunderstand me, at least I'll know and understand. Idk, random thought,I usually don't display it and definitely don't seek out professional help because 1. I don't dedicate myself enough to see progress and 2. Feel stuck this way and don't want to change because this is all I'm comfortable with. I HATE talking about my sob story little crybaby feelings to other people. I guess today its just a litte different becase im doing it online on a public subreddit and have my online identity to hide behind, and dont have to be face-to-face with anyone, but I rarely do this either. Also the feeling of being loved and cared for by myself or in a relationship repulses me also because i tell myself I don't deserve any of that and deserve to be in pain\n\n\"oh don't beat yourself up\" - yeah that's sure fkn easy for them to say",

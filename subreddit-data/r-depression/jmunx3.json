Why would an omniscient and omnipresent person/people overseer a very specific tiny ball of dust with little bipedal creatures in it out of a system in a galaxy, out of a hundred thousands of it there, and the galaxies that would probably amount to millions to trillions of it in a universe? After all, we might not be alone, or we're so far away we wouldn't be even making contact with each other. \n\nI'm half-torned in either being an atheist or a deist. There may or may not be a god, if he/she/it does, he/she/it wouldn't be intervening or touching one's life or even humanity as a whole - just observing the whole universe as such as a whole and the like. \n\nBut the concept of afterlife is just some mere concept created by the founders of the religion(s) (particularly Abrhamic ones, which would sound cult-like for the outsider religion standards) for people to be pressured by it one way or another significantly. \n\nAfter all, these all came from a book written by a random guy thousands of years ago, does it? It just doesn't feel right for me to believe with that and such.",

This higher force is in no way, shape or form a human or a humanoid, probably it's not even really a physical being like you and me, but I do believe it has a conscience. I do not believe that it looks after us or anything like that.\n\nDo I believe in afterlife? I don't know. It's just so much more logical to me that once we die, it ends. We stop existing. There's no more pain or joy. There's no more sorrow. There's no more memories or love.\n\nBut deep down, I'm afraid. What if I'm wrong? What if there is an afterlife? I don't believe in a biblical afterlife where we'll be judged and sent to wherever, but I'm afraid that we \"go\" wherever we feel we deserve to go. I put in quotes because I believe we create our own \"hell\", and we are stuck there for however long we feel like we should be. And if you guys are anything like me, that can very well be forever. Especially with the guilt of ending my own life.",

I don\u2019t like playing into the asshole I\u2019m-right-and-you\u2019re-wrong atheist stereotype. If people want to live their life by a pre-determined moral code, who am I to judge? It\u2019s not my job to police other people\u2019s beliefs. \n\nBut I did want to take some time to examine your argument a bit. If god does exist, like you said, its omniscient and omnipotent, which means that it\u2019s watching everything in the universe, INCLUDING this little speck of dust and water. It oversees all things, regardless of how small. If it\u2019s really all-powerful, it should have plenty of watching power to go around. \n\nThe concept of the afterlife isn\u2019t solely from the Abrahamic faiths. It transcends religion. We\u2019re just most familiar with the models presented by Judaism/Christianity/Islam. And every religion has their own ways of recruiting new members- it\u2019s how they stay alive. If the people with the beliefs die, their faith does as well. \n\nAnd like I said earlier, it\u2019s fine that you don\u2019t adhere to a religion. If it doesn\u2019t feel right to you, it doesn\u2019t feel right to you. But that\u2019s no reason to act so harshly towards (the good) people that are religious. It gives them comfort and purpose. And if it\u2019s real to them, and they\u2019re not personally hurting anybody with their beliefs, who cares? Extremists excluded, of course. Usually religion is about being a good person and whatever they\u2019re doing is not it.",

I didn't mean to go for a pro-atheist or pro-deist argument. It's up to you how you judge it. \n\nIt's just... that there's too much bad that I can't really see the good of religion, of how much people abuse and play with its rules for their own interests and such. Especially if the religion's relying too much into indoctrination, and the us vs them logic. \n\nThe more I get exposed to the history, people (both past and present), the more I see how religion can really affect people. Sure, it may unite and help comfort people, but as it goes larger, I feel like it's becoming contradictory and hypocritical to the point it wants people to see and examine. \n\nThe crimes, the scandals, the wars caused by these very religions. It's quite the same for those who want to purge it too, be it those who are purging it, or those who are of the other religions. Disagreements over rules, over words, over books. And what did the deity or deities do about it? Nothing we can say or argue.\n\nBut I'm just saying is that I try to think outside of the box especially when it comes to religion. It's all in the end, how humans interpret the environment and culture around them, from messages and such centuries and millenia ago rather much of something used to \"save\" them. I used to be a Christian, or at least that's what it says on my paper/legally speaking.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a tool of unity and harmony, be it for the good or bad and it's dependent on how would people judge or see it. It seems especially as it gets larger though, it's going for the latter. Best to just interpret and just use it for the best of oneself and the others near them.",

If your consciousness ceases at death, then the fact that you were worried about death whilst you were still alive is no longer a problem for you. It cannot 'suck' if you aren't conscious to experience the 'suckiness'. \n\nI could think that it sucks for my office chair that it isn't experience conscious sensation. But that doesn't make it so; the only suckiness there is in my mind and I am irrationally imputing that to the chair, which feels nothing. And if, when you die, all that is left is inanimate matter, then you will be equally as unperturbed or disappointed as the chair.\n\nIf you aren't conscious, things aren't sucking for you. If you go to sleep, the suck is suspended and then you wake up tomorrow and things still suck, then that's one matter. But if you are eternally free from the suck because you are inanimate matter and not a conscious entity, then it doesn't suck.",

I struggled with such thoughts for many years as a young child and all I can really say is that the minute you think the tunnel gets longer is when you hit a fake wall and break into the light. For me, it wasn't a matter of 'there is a light at the end of the tunnel' or 'just ride the wave'. it just hit me in the face like a cream pie on a clown. I had to claw my way out of some horrible thoughts, it feels so never-ending, but its not. You can never see that while its happening though, I wouldn't have believed anyone if they had said that to me a few months back. I had to seek help, and the best thing that anyone ever told me was to isolate the feelings I had so I could really understand them. often we don't understand the reason why we feel low, but I have found that usually its just trauma that is masked by our consciousness to protect us from its abstractions. Find a squint of joy, and exaggerate its as much as humanly possible. i'm talking a sprout to a tree kind of exaggeration. I tricked myself into feeling happy for a long time by applying this small pint of joy to every area of my existence but after a while, you won't be pretending anymore. Don't focus on it, it's just a very aggressive, hurt part of yourself. The less you give it, the less it feeds off of. The further you look into its reasoning, the faster it begins to heal :)",

I think, after decades of struggling, you get to a point where you are beyond pain.  I believe it is something like... resignation.  Basically you die before your body realizes it.  Feelings don't, exactly, exist anymore.  You become a kind of automaton, where you smile when needed, say the appropriately empathetic things, but inside all there is is a current of sadness.  It's not intense, it's just...there...all the time until the one day you are finally able to pass on and your wasted, unfulfilled life comes to an end.",

It\u2019s been a fucking long 2 decades of constantly suppressing the urge to die. 4 times I\u2019ve attempted it and someone always ended up interfering somehow and forcing life back upon me. Because of this, I\u2019ve never wanted to have children. I doubt children ever recover from the suicide of a parent. Though, my ex partner was abusive, I was so frightened of him. He wanted a child and eventually he got one. My daughter is 6 now, she is truly the one light in my life. The problem is that no matter how much I love her, I still feel no joy at all.  I never get excited the way I\u2019m supposed to when something great happens for her, I have to force myself to smile or laugh. My \u201chappy\u201d reactions are never genuine. I feel so much guilt I feel sick. When she goes to school in the morning - I plan my death every single day. I have written a plan for my funeral, letters for her, letters for the notable people in my life, tested the method I\u2019ll do it a million times... (at least I know it will work this time). I couldn\u2019t be more prepared this time. The only thing stopping me from finally being rid of this earth and myself is the thought she won\u2019t recover. That she might end up like me. So I continue breathing purely for the sake of someone else like you do. My biggest fear is having to be stuck here for another 20 years until she is old enough to take care of herself. \nSorry for not having anything constructive to tell you, I just wanted you to know that someone else understands the way you feel entirely. \nI really hope you find some peace somewhere along the way.",

The software can be saved and passed on through DNA and I see our human bodies as nothing more than a \"host\" to experience our code. Having kids I personally believe is a way of living on and continuing the experience. I feel this way because I have temporal lobe epilepsy and I've relived my life \"backwards\" until a point in college, this only was five minutes actually, but, felt very long like a whole other life. I remember instantly looking at a screen and not understanding English, then I did. Just imagine UNICODE for computers, we can program anything to recognize only what we allow it to understand, most likely to keep us in check.",

I thank god (or whatever is out there) that I found something that works for me every day, since psych meds are ineffective for so many people, and the difference is night and day; it's crazy when life starts to seem like it just might be worth living.\n\nSorry for the snarky reply to your initial comment, but I just thought it was a very obvious thing to say that doesn't really contribute or help",

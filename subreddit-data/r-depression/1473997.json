I had different people, but most of the time we just talked and I was told frequently I'm too sick for real things, like trauma therapy. I did DBT and didn't understand it cuz of autism and they just assumed everyone understood their emotions but was not able to control them (most of the group had BPD but I'm just autistic and bipolar).... I never could name my emotions. To this day I just know emotions based on symptoms or \"strength\". They have to be extreme to be nameable. I am pretty much depressed every day of my life though. But what's the \"point\" of therapy? what's it for? I never understood it. I did CBT and got a trauma response from it, and DBT I failed too. I haven't done anything else, but every therapist I've had has told me I'm too sick after a while...I was never treated in hospital because I was refused entry. (I went post attempt and they sent me to apply for some autism program instead because I have trouble talking when I'm distressed, but like... 1) I am high functioning and that's for low functioning, and 2) I was there for mental illness instead...)... So I'm rambling, but basically I have no idea what therapy is supposed to do or be. I don't understand it...",

It can be helpful to some people who just want someone to listen and pay attention to them. Supposedly, therapy is also a safe place that you can open up and speak your mind. In this world, you have to pretend to be happy all the time or you will be at disadvantage. It is fuck up world that discourages people from showing any sign of weakness, even around the people they trust.",

            "comment": "Therapy is supposed to do a few different things. On the topmost level, a therapist is a type of doctor, and you, as a patient, will tell your doctor \"Doctor, it hurts when I ____\" \n\nAnd your doctor goes \"Okay, lets figure out ways to make it stop hurting so much so you can ____ again.\"\n\nThat's it. They're not going to make your past pain go away. They are not going to magically make you less depressed right away. They're not going to take your \"side\" about conflicts you're in, they're not going to coddle you and tell you you're special. Their goal is to make you able to function like a human. Maybe it will be mental tricks, maybe just a revelation on why you're unhappy/suffering can help with this, or maybe it will take months or years of exercises. Their goal is to get to know a little about you and set up a plan to start giving your brain the tools it needs to make changes to itself. The majority of this is work you will have to do yourself, and your therapist is just your coach in this work. It still comes back to YOU being responsible for your own condition.\n\nI've had a few and honestly, I did not get a *lot* from the experiences. Everyone is different and we can't underestimate how ignorant the majority of people really are about their own minds. Many people really need help figuring out why they feel the way they do, how to identify emotional triggers and how to assign (or un-assign) blame as necessary for our issues.\n\nFor me it felt kind of like returning to the recess playground of mental knowledge, it all seemed pretty repetitive to the things I've already read and educated myself about my own problems, but then... not everyone reads up on their problems and self-examines critically so it's not like there is any failure in the institution as a whole.\n\nHere are some things that you may get from a good therapist:\n\n* An outside perspective. Your problems are unique, and maybe you have no idea that some of the trauma you've experienced is not only unusual, maybe it's *highly* unusual and you need more specialized care. We live in bubbles and it's important that we have someone we can trust and be honest with so they can tell us how fucked we really are.\n\n* Just someone to talk to. It doesn't really matter if they can help, sometimes we just need to talk to someone who isn't a friend or family member or significant-other. Trauma dumping on the same people every day is bad for you and them. If nothing else at all, having someone who will listen and provide feedback and you don't have to worry about how it will effect them, that alone is worth the price of admission.\n\n* Some new tips and tricks. Everyone perceives the world differently, so some mental health tips you read online may work for 80% of people but maybe you're the unlucky 20% that need a different approach. A good therapist will suggest ways to manage your thoughts and feelings that maybe you haven't tried before.",

I've waited a dozen years for psychiatry.... Even went to the ER while I was psychotic post-attempt and was refused. But therapy just felt like.... I dunno, like I was doing something wrong. I never could pinpoint it.\n\n&gt; maybe you have no idea that some of the trauma you've experienced is not only unusual, maybe it's highly unusual and you need more specialized care. \n\nMost people were abused as kids... I know I'm not special.

I don't need thought management. I just need a justifiable reason to exist...\n\nI think everything you've said is good and helpful to understand. I don't really have anyone to talk to ever, on any basis. There is no friends, family or SO, just as it has been that way for more than half my life....but it seems super silly for me to pay someone to \"care\" about things....am I reading that wrong? I'm convinced there is 2 things wrong: 1) I don't have enough brain chemicals (I'm bipolar). and 2) I legitimately have reasons to be depressed. I don't think it's all just some failing of my own. I am not depressed all because of \"triggers\" or something. Sure that can hurt, but depression is caused for me by fundamental unresolvable problems. I've been depressed since I was maybe 5 years old, and all along people always said \"it get's better\" without an explanation as to \"how\" things get better, so it didn't. None of it is my fault, but knowing that doesn't just suddenly make survival worth it. Am I making sense? So if I got this right, you're basically saying there's no point in therapy for someone like me?",

                            "comment": "\n&gt; I don't need thought management. I just need a justifiable reason to exist...\n\nThis line should be your own signpost that you *do* need thought management. The entire point of learning how to manage and guide your own thoughts is so that you generally feel better over longer-term periods, and thus diminish those feelings of not having a reason to exist. A person with healthier thoughts doesn't feel this way most of the time.\n\nYes, you have a \"good\" reason to be depressed and you have some serious challenges in front of you that even someone without bipolar disorder would be challenged to undertake, which is the slow and gradual process of re-paving new pathways in your brain. Little measures of progress daily to get your brain to a happier, healthier place.\n\nKeeping in mind of course I am not a professional nor do I know exactly what bipolar disorder and your own unique situation entails, but you ARE the controller of your brain, you do have will and intent, even if your thoughts aren't going where you want them to be.\n\nAnd this is really the hardest part, at least in my experience, which is the innate resistance to making these changes because the way you think is your identity, your identity is something your brain desperately needs to maintain, and this is why many people with mental health problems, depression and other disorders seem \"stuck\" even with a lot of help and medications. Not all of them are just so severely broken that they can never be happy and healthy, it's that they cannot allow their identity to die and don't see the \"other side\" and rather feel \"authentic\" than try to do fake exercises to pretend to be happy, etc.\n\nNot saying this is what you're experiencing but it is a danger, a pitfall of the therapy journey, that many people go to therapy with specific expectations and if they are not met, then the problem must be incurable so why bother. But in my own experience, therapy is supposed to incrementally increase your quality of thinking - and thus your quality of daily life. Just a little, here and there. This will avoid that pullback that your brain will do to fight change, it will give you a slower avenue to improvements.\n\nIt doesn't get better. Not on its own at least, it actually tends to get worse. People say it will get better because over time most people learn survival tools for getting through the hardships of life that even healthy people suffer through. We all have to cope with things that are very, very hard. And most people figure out ways to stay happy even as their lives burn around them as lives tend to do from time to time.\n\nNow with a mental health disorder this process is much, much harder or maybe needs entirely different approaches for you to get to a better place in your thoughts and feelings.\n\nI think if I could pass on ANYTHING that would help anyone the most, it would be to remember that no matter what your condition, your past, your plans or ideals, your brain works the same way whoever you are: *you experience feelings and your brain assembles a story to explain and justify those feelings.*\n\nCombine that with the knowledge that the more you do or think a thing, the more your brain defaults to that thing more and more. \n\nThose two points together are some of the strongest ideas in all of psychology (IMO) and have been instrumental in helping me get out of a mode of abject, spiraling self-destruction to just a mellow, daily depression, and then gradual improvements since. This wasn't entirely therapy that helped me make this improvement, but it was very helpful to have people trained to listen and analyze my own efforts and reinforce the good things I was doing.\n\n&gt; So if I got this right, you're basically saying there's no point in therapy for someone like me?\n\nI don't think you or I will ever be \"cured\" in any meaningful way, but I don't think that everyone with very set-in and difficult mental health conditions are necessarily incapable of improving their daily life. I do think that we have a very challenging opponent to beat though, which is our own brain and its selfish desire to never change, and the stories it makes up to convince you it's right.\n\nTherapy not working? try something different. Get a different therapist. Take a whole new approach. That's what I would do, and I wouldn't stop trying to find little ways to enjoy existing more, because we don't get a do-over, we have no idea if there's anything at all other than this experience, and I think we need to figure out whatever we can to make it as meaningful as we can and find ways to feel the feelings that we really want.",

I think the majority of my problems are mental illness related rather than autism related (even if autism makes us more susceptible). I kind of have always felt like, when I'm better that might be a more effective time to go to something like that.\n2. I've worried I wouldn't fit in properly there either. I have a tendancy to be rather annoying to people accidentally. Maybe it's an autism thing and we all just end up doing that to each other.\n3. I was ... kind of embarrassed.\n4. I do talk and contribute on the autism subreddit which is close I think?\n5. the biggest one of all: almost every single autism \"support group\" is designed for \"caregivers\" (whom I am not, nor do I have one whether I need that or not) to complain all \"woe is me\" about their kids. Those support groups are literally about \"poor parents\" who are \"heros\" for enduring children with special needs. It's fucking disgusting. I hate those people. I wouldn't be surprised if they abuse their kids too, just like my ex-parents did. Noone actually cares about us...Especially adults who never \"overcame\" (aka, did mental damage to themselves attempting to conform and mask rather than have their needs met) the societal expectations we aren't able to do...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I guess the main things are I never felt comfortable, the ones I did find weren't for people who were struggling, and the main problems I suffer are depression and other mental health problems. Autism feels like something I could actually deal with if I wasn't so sick, and I would add, I can only say that because once I was diagnosed I finally gave myself the room and acceptance to allow myself to address those needs, even if noone else would let me. I wear noise cancelling earmuffs now, so the rare \\*rare\\* time I can scavenge and sell enough of my junk to afford to go to the movies, I actually can go and the sound isn't hurting me anymore.

The combination is a perfect storm.\n\nBasically my biggest problem is my days are too inconsistent to work, and it's really hard to get hired when you are so depressed that you actually *look* miserable. Who wants to hire and keep the employee that stops midshift to break down and cry for a few mins?\n\nThere's also the fact that even the government wrote me off as permanently disabled and I am banned from ever applying to college or anything ever again. (I had my first bipolar episode in college over a decade ago) The money for that (student loans) cannot be approved either, even with never defaulting cuz they wrote them off as permanently disabled. So I can't even better myself. Plus I'm poor as fuck so I can't save because I practically starve just from paying for medications. So I settled on just working something. But it has to essentially be a perfect fit and somewhere that wouldn't mind me not being at work half the time. (I mean, I used to be very punctual and I missed less than half a dozen days in multiple years combined in most of my jobs).... So I don't have a lot of faith in my ability to ever be a functioning useful human.\n\nYes, it's my depression talking, but there's definitely reasons for it:\n\n1) I know I'll be alone till I die so it all feels worthless and pointless to me. This applies to ex-family, friends, and partners.\n\n2) There never ever was anything I wanted to be in my entire life, and I don't have confidence in anything anymore. I used to be smart but my ability to remember things is gone. So it wouldn't matter if I did go for education, nothing would stay in my brain anyway. My cognitive functions died on the little medication I have.\n\n3) there is no actual goals to have really. I know I'll be just as miserable in any job out there, because the only reason to work is to not starve and starvation isn't even a motivation anymore.\n\n4) there's nothing I even want anymore.\n\n5) with all my court cases going on (I'm fighting the government over transcare) I have to dedicate what little I have to that.\n\n6) even if I managed to get that far, I still wouldn't be happy and it would all be for noone or nothing.\n\n7) I feel too far from things that goals actually feel impossible, as I need to feel better before anything is even functionally actionable.\n\nAm I at least making sense? I do however like your idea of a smart goal, but noone ever tried that thing with me. I was always just demanded to provide them my goals and when I couldn't be specific that was the end of it. My last one fired me specifically because I couldn't name a specific goal for her, not exaggerating.",

The problem is I usually have to focus intently on physical signs to determine emotions. Heart rate is up and I'm shaking I know I have anxiety for example. I wouldn't know till there was a physical sensation though. So it's kind of hard to do the thing they want, which is like \"intercepting\" emotions that are just starting. For me until it's serious enough to have physical feedback, I won't know what is going on. In my teens it was so bad that I couldn't tell the difference between anxiety and depression even. Now later on I know depression because it's the \"more potent\" emotion and I tend to be crying day in day out....So basically, if I legit can't tell most of the time, is there any point of trying those types of therapies? Cuz the therapies I did, they never bothered to help me figure them out. They just expected everyone to be able to name them and then sort them out. (DBT was a group thing)",

I had everything and felt nothing. They talked to me about what aspects I enjoyed of what I was doing, work wise beyond my autonomy there wasn\u2019t much. I needed more of it, less corporate nonsense and more time to do things that used to make me happy like when I was a student I volunteered at the soup kitchen, the soup kitchen lost its funding in the 7yrs since I did it so I volunteered at the food bank instead and take great joy in telling people who say I\u2019m a good person that actually I do it for completely selfish reasons and seeing how puzzled they are because it\u2019s a kind of honesty most people don\u2019t expect but secretly suspect of do gooders.

I can't get past the depression+OCD combo. It's just too much for me.\n\n&gt; I also retrained to be a chattered accountant and work self employed so on the bad days I set my own workload and only appease myself.\n\nThe irony is, I went to college for accounting and went depressed then manic and dropped out.

I am so very lonely, and most places won't let me even volunteer (yeah, can you believe it?). I was refused at the library last year and noone is answering me to become a volunteer for pride this year (which is in a few weeks where I live). I have such a hard time, because what job or volunteering even exists that allows you to not physically interact with anything, and yet... somehow heals all the loneliness? I can't do call center stuff anymore (it made me mentally unwell before I ever was unwell), so work from home isn't an option either... I don't think there's any reasonable way for me to contribute. And then there's the other half of things, I can't be happy without the financial ability to afford the basics. So even volunteering, how does one manage that? I straight up don't have the financial means to survive without working (this year I just didn't pay my gas from January to May because I couldn't, so... it's that bad... and before you think I had priorities wrong, consider for half of the year I had no internet at home either).",

As an accountant I\u2019m self employed, so can pick and choose clients many of who carried over from connections I\u2019d made whilst underwriting between maintaining the two professional qualifications I\u2019m lucky with the kind of work I\u2019m doing means once a client is set up it\u2019s a lot of oversight because as long as the system is used properly it works out as only a couple of hours a day on average, I could do more and earn more but 9-5 makes me miserable, which is why accounting despite being incredibly dull compared to my original degree in politics and international relations was the one I chose because it had easy cross over. whilst I was working as an underwriter I was informed enough to take out a good insurance policy with a lifetime employee discount which I only have to pay a top up on for my therapy despite it not being too expensive a policy-worth noting though UK medical insurance is much cheaper has much lower excesses than the uk. \nBut even in the US where I imagine you are there are likely additional services available for those on disability free or discounted. \n\nThe NHS don\u2019t have enough therapy places for patients that need them the plus side of this travesty is when they tell you they can\u2019t get you the help you need in a timely manner unless you can pay for it they hand out antidepressants like sweets at Halloween in the US. Even if you\u2019re about to end it. We have crisis teams but they aren\u2019t great unless you fit very precise criteria which few people do. 15 yrs ago when I started this journey they were also happy to perscribe me daily fluoxetine and diazepam on an as and when needed basis for GAD which I also have but I\u2019m aware that has been maintained because I\u2019m a historic patient. I wouldn\u2019t get the diazepam now only the antidepressants. \n\nMy duties at the food bank involve smiles, hugs and taking people around so they can pick out x amount of items, chat and see what other services they need, maybe give them some leaflets. I only do this one afternoon a week mainly to keep me in contact with society because hermiting feels nice but is bad for my depression. Some days I go in apathetic but because we\u2019re all volunteers we support each other and will swap if someone can\u2019t handle front of house and would rather process forms or stack shelves. There are non people people who volunteer in these kind of roles specifically. I\u2019m only a few years ahead of you, I started working for myself in Jan 2020-not my best timing. \n\nI\u2019ve had to design life to live up to my expectations not those of other people and most of the getting here was torturous can you imagine the discipline it takes to turn up to a job, go home and study and volunteer on weekends whilst depressed because you know it\u2019s the only way to build what you want-if I wasn\u2019t at the point of ending it before there were several stops where it became more of an option, but I have come out the other side. I had the advantage that I wasn\u2019t lonely, but if you can get yourself medicated even if you have to skim over a few things with the gp- I assume you\u2019re not in the UK then once you find the right combo of medication you\u2019ll be amazed what you can do-I came off during the pandemic and was a bit ashamed when I went back on but understanding I need those pills like a diabetic needs insulin because they literally make me function helps. \n\nWhen you were rejected for those volunteer positions what feedback did they give you? I\u2019d also suggest places like food banks without paid employees might be more willing to take you on than places like museums who essentially need/want people with private means to do everything a fte would for free. \nDo you also have physical disabilities? Working out what your hurdles are might help you work out where you can start and I\u2019m willing to help with that if you want that advice but I\u2019m not qualified in any way apart from personal experience and not from the same system. \n\nThe only thing I can see that I had over your current situation was a supportive partner and family but at my worst despite them being the reason I was still here I doing my best to drive them away without knowing it. They wanted to help once I was willing to help myself and that help took many forms.",

It didn't cover prescriptions or dental, so it became redundant.... I am in Canada. Any pre-existing conditions get excluded from all insurance policies. And since the policies guarantee profit even if you claimed 100% of the limits (with a select few exceptions), it makes it highly irrelevant. It's literally cheaper to not have insurance than to have it. Nowadays I think it would be like $1600-$2000/year (admitedly cheaper than most US plans) but only give about $600 dental and $0 for prescriptions (since all my conditions are ongoing... once you are diagnosed bipolar, mental health meds will not be covered basically)...\n\nAs for additional benefits, only some people can get them. I am lucky my federal disability pension (basically I'm \"retired\" because of mental illness, I had to pay in to get this though) is low enough to still qualify frm the provincial disability program (essentially \"disability welfare\")... but my pension will soon eclipse the provincial one, in about 2 years. At which point I won't have partial medication/dental coverage anymore. Right now, I had to go without 1 of my medications because it's not covered....against doctors orders I cut a different dose in half... of a slow release cap, that they did happen to cover....but I legit couldn't afford the $160/mo it was gonna cost me. I already pay for estradiol out of pocket ($65/mo, they won't cover, but they cover testosterone injections so I'm intending to raise a gender discrimination case when I'm through my other cases)... they would cover glasses but they required a reassessment but wouldn't pay for the assessment, so it was basically a loophole, people too poor for the assessment can't even get glasses. It's really really shit coverage, but it's all I got, and it's better than nothing, because in 2 years I won't have that either unless they raise the limits (the way it works here, is they deduct dollar for dollar any other \"earnings\" such as my pension, so if your pension is $1 over, you lose all benefits, which is like $300/mo worth to me of the things they DO cover). There is zero absolutely *zero* coverage for therapy at any level. Psychiatry is already paid for by the province separately, but there are no psychiatrists and they won't even *let* you pay for one, because if you \"needed it\" you are supposed to just get one, but like 5-10% of the population just never has access (it's not just me). The catch 22 of the system designed to be inclusive is when it fails then there's just no service at all...\n\nThere are zero, absolutely ZERO discounts for people with disabilities for the private insurances. In fact, admitting you have a disability *automatically* raises your rate along with your chances of refusal. And it's entirely legal to do so, even if your coverage is for things entirely unrelated to your condition.",

I am aware of the costs, hence why I self-represented in the first case for the first part. It caused too much mental stress though, so I decided not to do the rest myself. The thing is, a lot of people appear to have some means to save, but I've never in my life had that, even when I was working. Money just ended up being dumped into my house when it was available, but I only really had any disposable income for a year and a half of my life, wherein it only existed because I had no car. There is no way even if I magically was healthy that I'll ever be able to outrun the system... I learned in my teens that just because you need something, doesn't mean you get it. So I just go without a lot of stuff, whether it's medical care or heat or internet half the time.... Also, I think you are missing the fact that most of the court cases are just simply debt. If I lose the collections cannot touch my income to collect, but if I win everything, then it get's repaid through that. And lastly, I have never had a good mental state, so if I have suffered for 15+ years, genuinely what makes you think I'll ever be well enough?

Maybe not a good life, but a tolerable one. It took me a very long time to get to that realization. The problem is, my needs aren't met, and I am incapable of resolving those dilemmas on my own.... I would compare it to the mazlo's hierarchy thing. I have not solved the bottom of the pillar (both literally and figuratively), but a lot of people (and it appears you as well) believe I should somehow be able to imagine a world where I am half way up it (I'm not going to say at the top because I don't think anyone ever get's there, except the ghandi types)...",

However it's a problem particular bad in my region. The bigger ones elsewhere are definitely better (I know because there is some overlap between teams in my city and the neighbouring city, and when you talk to theirs, they're all for helping until it comes to services you require locally and then they refer me back to the useless idiots who refuse at all to help).\n\n&gt; at the food bank involve smiles, hugs and taking people around so they can pick out x amount of items\n\nyeah...all of which I could never do... I feel so useless, and envious tbh....\n\n&gt;  I assume you\u2019re not in the UK then once you find the right combo of medication you\u2019ll be amazed what you can do\n\nI've been waiting for treatment for 12 years... it'll never end at this rate. that's why I feel so hopeless... And no, I'm in Canada.\n\n&gt; but understanding I need those pills like a diabetic needs insulin because they literally make me function helps.\n\nI understand your feelings on this exactly. I was recently offered Vyvanse for my inability to concentrate and organize and stuff, and it helped and all I could think of was how embarrassed I was that it actually *helps* me, cuz I feel like a child that I needed that... But I did. I only started it 2 weeks ago, and it's been kind of the best mental health med I ever took, but like, the depression doesn't end with it either (although it supposedly can do that). FYI it only takes 1 week to see a result with stimulant meds, it's not like real antidepressants.\n\n&gt; When you were rejected for those volunteer positions what feedback did they give you?\n\nSome just ignored me, but the library I was pretty persistent with and they told me they weren't allowed to because they were unionized. They said there was some legal conflict that obligated them to pay me if I did the same work as anyone in the building even if it was off the books, and that if they had the bookstore section open again I could volunteer there, but since it was closed and likely will never reopen again, I was told to not hold my breath. or did you mean something else entirely?\n\n&gt; I\u2019d also suggest places like food banks\n\nI can't do that, my OCD won't permit me, and I can't manage anything related to food (it's complicated). I can do like data entry things perhaps, but I'm in no shape for that right now either... I have only been getting worse, which is ironic cuz a year ago I was crazy as fuck but had a lot more \"neutral days\" mixed in with the depressed days. Now I rarely hear any voices or other auditory/visual hallucinations (except when I'm very stressed), but I just happen to be depressed nearly every single day ever instead. I'd rather be crazy again, cuz at least I wasn't crying relentlessly....\n\n&gt; museums who essentially need/want people with private means to do everything a fte would for free.\n\nthat's what I did last year. I was converting/digitizing archives for my local museum. I applied to a lot of places till I got in there... it was the lonely \"dungeon\" I intended to resume this year, but my depression got even worse to the point it is no longer possible to maintain my health, house, or even basics of life, so I have no mental resources left to manage to overcome the OCD problems...and it wasn't very fulfilling being alone in the basement like that.\n\n&gt; Do you also have physical disabilities? \n\nOnly I can't lift heavy things cuz of a tear in my chest, and a bone in my right foot broke at some point without medical care a few weeks ago, so I can't walk consistently since then. I am pretty capable, I'm just weak. My real disabilities are mental health related and Autism related. I can't handle loud noise busy places or weird sensory textural issues (often related to keyboards/mouses, but most places use the good old school ones that don't click wrong which works for me), which is why the library felt like a good fit. I would say OCD is the biggest barrier, even bigger than the bipolar, but like... the bipolar steals my ability to cope with the OCD.\n\n&gt; I\u2019m willing to help with that if you want that advice but I\u2019m not qualified in any way apart from personal experience and not from the same system.\n\nit's okay, I appreciate the time you've already invested, don't worry...\n\n&gt; They wanted to help once I was willing to help myself and that help took many forms.\n\nOIC.... yeah, not like my ex-family. I was told all kinds of awful things. My grandmother tried to get me to finish things off because I'm trans.... yes, my own grandmother. Most of my ex-family has no mercy for mental health and told me they don't want to know me when I'm depressed, because they don't have time for that shit and that I'm supposed to just suck it up, blah blah, and that they have their own problems so mine are irrelevant.... That's part of why they are ex-family now... Frankly one person subtly implied they hope I die so they can inherit my stuff...",

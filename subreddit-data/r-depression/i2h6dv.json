    "postText": "Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to \"be good for your mental health\"... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.\n\nI went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.\n\nIf people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.\n\nIt's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.\n\nMore than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the comments. I didn\u2019t expect to get any response. It\u2019s hard to describe, but I feel very moved that there are people out there that I reached in a small way for a short moment of time.",

Now I don't have the willpower to force myself anymore. I just lie in bed, listen to music, watch youtube, etc just like you. I'm scared of trying other things that 'might help' because what if in the end nothing helps? Like the other things I tried before? What if there's nothing left. I'd rather run away from reality. \n\nI really hope we can find something that helps us take hold of our lives. It's the only hope I cling to, that one day I may find something I can actually do and not feel miserable and useless. But I'm not actively looking for it or anything.

A few years ago I used to have a more healthy lifestyle than now, but it seemed more of a chore or distraction than a solution. Sometimes I wonder if I just didn\u2019t give it enough time for it to make a positive difference. It marginally helped the depression, but being more active and less passive in life escalated my anxiety a lot, so I similarly stopped making the effort if the result ultimately had no net benefit. At this point resigning to passivity feels like both self-sabotage and the \u2018safest\u2019 thing to do because at least I won\u2019t be let down anymore by failed efforts.",

You also have to understand that depression has a side effect profile just like medication, and has black box warning of suicide tendencies. How is that not worse than medication? We can't help you if youre dead. Secondly you are like a node in a network and your depression does affect those nearby they just hide it well just like you hide depression well to not drag you/them down.\n\nYou think most patients that go in for help arent sceptical of therapy and medication? Most people do. \nWhen i my anxiety was increasingly worse because of neglect and not getting help, after the few years it turned to panic attacks and agoraphobia. At that point the thought of my panic attacks getting EVEN worse was more scary than the panic attack of going outside after calling the psychiatrist.\n\nI was afraid of side effects so i cut the pill into small quarters and took increasingly bigger bits and by day 5 i realized i had no side effects. None at all. \n\nAt week 3-4 i noticed i could go to grocery store without getting nauseous from anxiety. I didnt overthink anymore and the feeling of being watched was gone. Even if i bumped into a friend, such interaction would scare and put me off but now there was ... No anxiety at all.\n\nIt took some time to get used to feeling..normal. anxiety was the normal for me all my life so for the first time have none of the constant white loud noise in my head was so weird. I started wanting social interaction which i never did before in my life. Without the anxiety i could actually enjoy the interactions.\n\nAs for addiction, only very few drugs are addictive, like Adderall and ritalin because they produce euphoria. Who wouldn't enjoy the feeling good? But these are not antidepressants, most such drugs are illegal. So antidepressants are not euphoric at all and are not recreational. No one takes antidepressants the way you take recreational drugs to get high. Theres no high or euphoria at all. Im saying this as recovering addict.\n The only drug that is easily accessible and produce dependence are benzodiazepines. You could say you will refuse benzos because of dependence potential thats it. Benzos are not really enjoyable but are great anxiety killers. They're not antidepressants.\n\nAs for dependence of antidepressants, they unlike drugs of abuse, last a very long time before they're metabolised. This makes it easy to avoid any issues of dependence. By reducing the dose very gradually you will not have any discomfort at all. Thats literally their advantage of safety and lack of discomfort.\n\nIf you're suffering a lot you have no luxury to choose. You can at least give it a try for a month and if it doesn't work you will stop. A month is exactly when i had obvious positive effect",

I think I was a bit prideful, like 'I can do this by myself, I don't need help or medicine, nothing will help anyways.' I don't like the idea of taking medicine every day, but as you said that is a luxury. \n\nI guess I'm also scared of changing. I've always been the way I am; shy, anxious, gloomy, silent and withdrawn. I'm scared of becoming someone else. Even if that is a major improvement. Weird huh. \n\nBut truth is, I've just been sinking deeper and deeper, and I'm a huge burden on those around me. I've been dealing with my depression in the most unhealthy of ways, because I thought I had tried everything. I just was never willing to try medication. I've already got an addiction (not drugs related) so don't want to add more. \n\nAll I've ever heard from people around me (and here on reddit) is how medication either didn't do anything, or was very addictive, or had nasty side effects (it gave this girl I know terrible tics, permanent). I'm known to be very sensitive to even the lightest doses of medicine, and have had some pretty nasty side effects in the past, which is why I'm so apprehensive. \n\nBut that's why I'm thankful to read about someone's positive experience for once. And you're right, if I'm already suffering, why not try the medication? I'm done with feeling this way and I think this was the wake up call I needed. It's the last and only thing I haven't tried yet. I'll start looking into it to see what's available for me in my country. Honestly, thank you.",

I dragged myself anyway, regardless of my mental temper tantrums and beliefs, some part of me just knew this is what I HAVE to do, not think, just DO.\n\n Next &gt;*nothing will help anyways* \n\nYou dont know that. especially since you havent tried not a single of the bunch of different antidepressants and not a single psychotherapist trained to help people exactly like you and me.\n\n If for example theoretically, the second or even first antidepressant you will try will be perfect fit for you and reduced 90% of your depression - its sitting right there for grabs, available, but you dont know it even existss and suffer needlesly.. \n\nYou have to look at depression as a evil conspiracy, a downward spiral where it tries to drag you down by pushing your buttons. With depression it pushes thoughts in your head like notorious \"its not bad enough yet to warrant asking help\" which is bullshit, because once it festers inside you for long enough it has roots deep down in your psyche and is extremely hard to get rid of. \n\nTreating it as soon as possible prevents it from manifesting from mild depression to moderate depression to severe depression and then suicidal tendencies and selfdestrucction. You would wait until the last stage to get help? I dont think standard methods will work anymore at that stage.. which is very unfortunate.\n\nRemember it takes a month at least for AD to kick in, so if youre very skeptical, give it a try for a month and quit if you dont like it. Since the concentration of the AD rises gradually each day, you dont actually feel it kicking in, and even after a month where its working, you may feel absolutely the same. However thats when you are supposed to really analyze past 7 days vs before starting the AD. Thats when you will notice big differences here and there simply because of how very gradually the AD is kicking in, so theres no sudden change in wellbeing. \n\nIt doesnt make you happy, it just makes you less depressed, especialy less anxious since most ADs are mildly sedating. There are completely different ones if the first one doesnt work. For example bupropion is absolutely different, and not sedating, its pure stimulant that  may increase anxiety in people with anxiety disorders, but very helpful for melancholic lethargic depression as it gives you energy and motivation. \n\n*&gt; I guess I'm also scared of changing. I've always been the way I am;*  \n\nI was too, but i became even more scared of getting worse, wasting life opportunities and my youth and never experience true life and the pleasures of the best years of my life. After 20 years you will be even more shy and anxious, but much more miserable because of what i just mentioned. Its very depressing state to be in. Imagine if you got help and it worked, your depression is almost all gone, now as your future self, look back to your current self, and think of what would your future self (not as shy and more outgoing) think and say to your current self? Do you think your future self wasnt scared of change? :D he was. but did it anyway.\n\nWhen my AD was working fully at 2 months in, i remember being upset that i didnt get help sooner, because i spent my childhood and teenage years absolutely isolated, introverted with panic attacks and agoraphobia. It was very sad life, that was..avoidable:(\n\n  ***&gt;I'm scared of becoming someone else*** \n\nNow think back of that future version of yourself, he's better and not as shy, most of the time not depressed anymore and outgoing. This IS someone else, this version of you is different, but in a very positive way. If i gave you a cure for depression, would you be scared of becoming someone else? someone else being YOU without depression and anxiety. You should be scared of not becoming someone else, but of staying the same for years to come. \n\nADs dont change your personality. You are still yourself, man. And you FEEL yourself. Its usually antipsychotics that numb emotions so much people become a shell of themselves.  But when you dont have anxiety anymore and feel more upbeat and less depressed, you do act differently, right? but in a positive way. You shouldnt be afraid of becoming someone else, because 9times/10 that someone else would be in a better position than your current self even if picked randomly. You are scared of making things worse, not scared of change. But most people that come in to psychiatrist have exact same fears and take a while to talk them into finally trying antidepressants, and then them being sour that they waited so fucking long, so much needless suffering...\n\n***&gt; I'm a huge burden on those around me*** \n\nEven more of a reason to get psychiatrist. If not for you, for them. You will feel better when you know you arent a burden anymore to them and they arent hiding their bitterness for you.\n\n***&gt; 've been dealing with my depression in the most unhealthy of ways,***  \n\nProof that you have to hand over the care of you to someone else, who is trained to help people exactly like you. You wouldnt believe how common your state is in other depressed people that come in. Let someone trained to take care, as you are choosing wrong ways of treating yourself and make it all worse. There are people that WANT to help you, really.\n\n\\&gt;  ***I've already got an addiction (not drugs related) so don't want to add more.*** \n\nYour addiction (to sugar?) is very very likely just a coping mechanism of selfmedicating your depression and anxiety. Antidepressants as i said are not addictive in the same sense and you can quit tapering without having any discomfort. Secondly, since AD will treat you depression and especially anxiety, you will have less of the desperation to cope and selfmedicate the depression away. SSRI antidepressants definitely help with anxiety, but not always with depression, atleast not as much as anxiety. However if depression is worsened by anxiety, the relief of anxiety will relieve depression. I assure you, you will be much calmer mentally with ADs and not need caffeine and sugar to reduce sufffering",

But I won't give up before trying everything I can. \n\nAlso, I'm not addicted to sugar lol I'm addicted to porn it's really fucked me up. (might also be addicted to sugar but who isn't right?) Maybe porn isn't classified as a 'real' addiction? I don't know but it is my go to coping mechanism and I can't stop. That and starving myself are the only things that make me feel something. I feel pathetic to rely on something else (like porn or antidepressants) to be able to live my life. But if I think of antidepressants like medication for an illness (which it is right?) there's nothing to be ashamed about. I just had these stupid misconceptions all this time. Coping in these unhealthy ways only makes things worse in the long run because it makes me hate myself even more. But it was all I could do to not lose my mind.",

I cannot motivate myself, I've tried and what little motivation I can muster dissipates in little to no time at all. \n\nThe only way I can do things is out of unhealthy obligation. For example, if I don't go to work every day I'll be homeless and hungry. Instead of doing something positive I try to avoid the biggest negative which feels like such a backwards way of thinking. It only exacerbates my problems.\n\nI've been on anti-depressants for half a year now and I find myself not feeling as miserable or numb but I'm still nowhere near feeling normal. It feels like it's too far away to grasp that feeling.\n\nEdit - rephrased first sentence",

First med-absolute shit side effects after a day. Second med combo-changed my fucking life.\n\nYou're just screaming in your head IS THIS HOW NORMAL PEOPLE FEEL OMG, legitimately had coworkers remarking that i was smiling again (I didn't even realize), and while meds are not always the answer, for me they were the catalyst to be able to begin to do the things i had - no, wanted - to do, and sometimes that nudge helps get the creaking wheels back into motion.\n\nStill have days where I'm depressed as fuck but that's also more likely to happen if the day before i decided to sleep 6h later than usual, eat junk, skip exercising, procrastinate on work, etc etc etc. And on the days where there is no cause, my antidepressants almost always kick in 2h after i take them and i just... Almost magically and eerily, get out of bed, and sometimes, doing that alone is a small step in the right direction. Of course that doesn't always happen. Like today. Have a huge list of things and things that will happen if i do them and yet I can't be bothered to do any of it.\n\nLong hard road ahead there. And a lot of the time it doesn't feel worth it. Anhedonia doesn't help. As my therapist told me the other day: i want you to give yourself credit, instead of me telling you to give yourself credit. And we very often prefer to hyperfocus on all the things we could be doing, that we aren't doing, that others seem to have no trouble doing, then ruminating on that. They say do the gratitude thing but I hate it lol.",

Ive tried 5 antidepressants, 2 antipsychotics, 1 benzo, and the rest just random drugs being used off label (gabapentin, hydroxizine, a beta blocker) in the past two years. I got prescribed most of these by a psychiatrist and the rest in a psych ward. Now im on 300 mg wellbutrin because SSRIs and SNRIs were not working long term and i was gaining excessive weight (i was 115 lbs when i was 18, before meds. I am now 21 and nearly 150) along with having no sex drive, night sweats, worsening depression. I am not taking any other meds besides trazodone to sleep.\n\nI got on the wellbutrin 2 and a half weeks ago and am not noticing any difference but im also withdrawing from kratom so that doesnt help my case any since kratom messes with your dopamine levels massively. If this doesnt work, i feel like my only option for meds left is tricyclics or MAOI or whatever theyre called inhibitors, and those have an abundance of side effects that im certain are worse than SSRI and SNRI meds. Otherwise ive looked into medical marijuana and ketamine infusions, but cannot afford them.",

And honestly, while I personally didn't feel much of a difference, the fact that roommates, coworkers, and friends all commented on it means that they were definitely working.\n\nEveryone is different but I'm also on Wellbutrin and that helped a lot with the \"just kill me now\" feeling when you first wake up. Lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer and to decrease seizure risk, then since my anxiety is mostly physical and not mental, propranolol was the difference between dreading meetings to actively participating in them.\n\nI also found medication timing to be pretty important, and on days i sleep in or forget to take something +-3h i feel like absolute shit.\n\nFeel free to dm for more specific details!",

You may never be free of it, but you keep building up ways to combat it so you can take action or get the semblance of something better than this. We're all in this together.",

I couldn\u2019t focus on anything, very suicidal, was starting to do poorly in all of my classes, and was no longer being effective at helping others at my internship. I\u2019ll spare you all the fluffy details, but long story short I reluctantly decided to give medication another try. After about a month I was feeling a little better, after two I was feeling the best I had in over a year. It was like something clicked in my brain, and the things my therapist was telling me to do finally made sense. It was like the medication helped reconnect whatever was off in my brain so that I had the energy and motivation to fight my own sick mind and start getting better. Things aren\u2019t perfect now, and I still have bad days, but my life has veeeery slowly gotten better. \n\nOP I\u2019m in no way trying to invalidate your experience. I\u2019m really sorry that your school\u2019s counselor failed you. I know medication definitely isn\u2019t for everyone, and finding a doctor is hard. I just wanted to share a bit of my story in the hopes of giving you even the tiniest glimmer of hope and motivation.",

Your stomach is growling, but your laying there safe and warm and you keep putting it off for just another few minutes of that lovely 'sinking into the mattress' 'just the right temperature' comfortable safe space. Then you fall back asleep and wake up 3 hours later feeling like crap with that strange furry mouth feeling and you feel even less like getting up. I call it a crash day. Your lucky if you make it to the sofa in your Pjs and find something to eat that you don't  have to order in. God forbid picking up the phone to your mother when she calls, actually feeling enough self respect to shower, dress, prepare healthy food, drink water and engage with other people.

What a time to be depressed, frankly.\n\nI just hope I find a drug that helps me some day. I despair of any sort of lifestyle advice, I really do, because it effectively individualises the problem and solution, making me feel at fault if I can't follow it. But that's literally what I need help with in the first place. Doing something good can only ever result in a temporary experience or feeling. It is progress and meaning that a depressed person lacks a feeling for and that seems to be at the core both at the motivational and cognitive level of the disorder. A treatment isn't worthy of that name if it doesn't address the core experience of the problem.\n\nThanks for the post, OP. I feel less alone. Often I blame myself for every day spent frozen unable to move my body alongside my thoughts, for every smile painfully faked, for every Sisyphean action trying to lifestyle my way out of depression. I'm grateful that I did try all these things, because my world has expanded through them, but they're not going to fix me.",

It is the trauma that remains and keeps being reignited and relived. And it is trauma from childhood as well as from that period of illness. I myself learned in childhood that the only thing to do with a problem, dilemma, worry, mistake or emotion was to feel ashamed of it, put up with it and try to ignore it, and so that was what I did with all my problems. Needless to say it's turned out badly.\n\nI agree that being loving towards the self helps to support decisions that honour and care for one's future self, and thank you for writing about that because it's always useful to feel that reinforced from somebody else. If you aren't fighting your feelings, you can use that energy to address them constructively.\n\nHow is your ankle? I hope you managed to give it some care. If not, no need to be ashamed, you still can.\n\nI think I'll look up that YouTuber. Thank you again for your openness in discussing this. I hope that by giving yourself the love and parenting you need, life will open up to you.",

I started struggling with depression when I was in the third grade. I won't go back there. \n\nMy biggest \"aha!\" Moment was when I had gone through so much  therapy (some good some just okay) and was just done.  I talked to my primary doctor and he said \"do you apologize for wearing glasses?\" Of course I don't. And he went on to explain that I had a chemical imbalance. \n\nHe helped me with meds. I had talked and talked to to so many people about my issues. \n\nMy depression has been an old friend, a warm blanket. It is familiar. It is also an unbelievable struggle. It draws you back. \n\nI want to speak to those of you who are so much younger than my 48 years- life is good. It does get better. Talk about how you feel. Now is better that it was 20 years ago. I can say to my friends \"I was in a bad place\" and they care.  Your friends will too. \n\nLet me tell you - I didn't think I would live to see my being married with an amazing son. My life that I didn't think had meaning does now. You will find your way. Promise. \n\nThe darkness will come. And sometimes we welcome it. Just for a bit.  Then we gain our strength and we fight it.

The feeling of fatigue and struggle to do basic things, in my case, needs medicine to overcome. Caffeine only goes so far. A lot of depression gets worse if untreated, so be proactive while you can.\n\nSince things do take a lot of effort, don't be hard on yourself. Surrender to the fact that you have this thing, it's not your fault you have it, and even if you did manage to do all of the \"outer\" things, it's an \"inner\" issue. Walks, meditation, petting animals, watching comedies, eating well, working out, etc are all great advice, but they don't make a dent in a chemical imbalance. That's why it's important to reach out. All it takes is a couple of phone calls with nice people who want to help. Start there. You can even do that in bed. \n\n\nAnother thing you can do in bed, which I just started doing, is the Cognitive Behavioral Workbook for Depression. It's on amazon, and it's pretty awesome so far. Aside from that, Journaling helps too. Just write all of these feelings and thoughts out as they show up. You don't have to do it everyday, or show anyone, but it's good to get it out of the head and onto a page. Don't expect them to feel easy, make you feel better, or give you any pleasure. Just think of them as beneficial steps to take while you're stuck in a rough place.\n\n\nA pen, a book, a blank notebook, and a phone call. Those great first steps, don't take much effort, you can do them all with music playing, and they may lead you to a more manageable place. Best of luck! I'm on the same journey.",

When i was at college i only slept 45 minutes a night because i couldnt focus on my work, all i did was work 23 hours a day and sleep an hour just to not fail. Since getting my stimulant prescription, i now regularly sleep 8+ hours a night because i can actually function, this helped me a lot. No anti-depressant or therapist could have helped me like this.\n\nAlso, magic mushrooms reminded me what it felt like to be happy for the first time in years. I tripped once and since then i exercise, got a job, drink water, stopped using any drugs at all, i have hobbies like art  and writing, etc. \n\nThose two might not work for everyone, nor would i reccomend everyone try psychedelics or stimulants, but for me personally, they helped a lot.\n\nI used to be a blubbery alcoholic, now im fit and healthy looking, i care about my clothes and hygiene, im able to socialize, etc.\n\nIm still very depressed, but im able to do much more than i was before and im very grateful for both of those substances.",

My eventual ticket out if this hell was driving a wedge in the cycle either at the motivation part or at the depression part. I found it much more helpful to target the source itself (mine was a dark childhood leading to cyclical thinking of hopeless self-hatred, so cognitive therapy was perfectly suited to my case). Exercise and eating right may hell to boost motivation as you rightly say, but that should be a starting point to attacking the depressive root.

Idk where you live and whether it's affordable but getting better isn't (as you're saying) about knowing what to do and neither is therapy. I mean to some degree it is but I've been in group therapy for years and most people there were very smart and reflective; they did understand their behaviour quite well. Therapy isn't about what you do but about why you do it. I know you might feel like their advice was useless because you barelyanaged to go there but for me it helped a lot. Personally I only went to counselling when I had to redo an exam and I realized on my own I wouldn't get myself to study and then drop out of uni. I needed to get close to failing completely before I could ask for help. Ultimately the only one who can change and heal you is yourself but others can help you a lot on that journey. I think the biggest support from my group therapy to me was having regular appointments and also having other people there that fail just as much as you do. It took at least 2 years but I got to the point where I actually want to make myself better and not just deal with whatever shit is hitting me right now. I've been in therapy for 4 years now and I've gotten a lot better but I still fail regularly and it can be really hard to do anything. I'm not saying this to discourage anyone - I've definitely made a lot of progress overall - I'm just trying to say that the goal shouldn't be to \"just do all those things\" but doing it once. You shouldn't say \"I'm going to go outside for 30mins every day\" but rather \"today I'm going outside for 30 mins\" and do the same thing tomorrow. Longtime goals and plans are very important but you have to start small. Don't expect too much of yourself but also know that in time, you can make it!",

            "comment": "Thanks for sharing and I\u2019ve experienced similar challenges. At one point I was in a trance like state in bed about 20 hours a day. Figured either sleep or semi sleep was the best way to avoid reality and in a way time travel. \nAnd I\u2019ve had multiple therapist, some strict and logical while others were semi spiritual but I\u2019ve found it\u2019s really tough to find someone who will stop and really listen. Therapist usually are trained in one or two methods and see things that way. Recall a cognitive therapist tell me to replace negative thoughts with neutral or positive ones... I agree that actually does work and I grew up learning a similar concept in tennis; avoid negative talk like after making a mistake thinking \u201cI suck!\u201d And replace it with, \u201csometimes I miss and I can get better...\u201d or something. And I do agree this can work and a lot better than one might assume. Then I told the therapist when I \u201cthink\u201d it\u2019s like watching a movie, it\u2019s not always in sentences... There seems to me things that can work for different people so I did really give this cognitive thing a good try for a few weeks. Even though I don\u2019t follow this particular path; I did learn a few things and hey being mindful is a good thing.\n\nI\u2019ll share something that is helping me some and hope it might be some help for someone reading this... also I\u2019ve borrowed from various areas and this is not coming from me; I\u2019m no expert etc.\n\nI try to remember to have gratitude for the day. I can find something positive in my environment and if not; I can cheat and think of my cat (or dog in heaven) and it opens my heart at least for a moment. So then I\u2019m temporarily at least in a neutral state (not negativity). \n\nRecently I heard or read someone smart who explained that emotions come from the body and we can use our mind to override and force ourselves to do things. And yes I experience what I call the black hole that pulls me to bed and I want to lay down, feeling so tired like I ran two marathons and just be there waiting for time to pass. Time will pass and the guilty will kick in or I\u2019ll find a way to temporarily distract myself with cleaning the house or music or a documentary (avoid news omg). \n\nAnother phrase that seemed to help me is action comes before motivation. I always assumed you had to be feeling it before you do something. Whatever it is you choose to do; just show up and do it even if you feel like crap and feel like you suck. I\u2019ve discovered I can draw and draw for hours; hey at least it passes the time but then again there are times I think, drawing and cleaning the house every day is not a living hell but I still feel stuck but at least less stuck than laying in bed.\n\nI struggle with all of this because of my personal history and over the years I have become isolated and after being alone for years and not having anyone that actually wants to hear your opinions or ideas; I start to question if I exist; I mean sure I can wear a social mask and small talk but I don\u2019t know how to explain it. It\u2019s something like, if I have an interesting (to me) thought and no one hears it, does it really exist or matter? \nLots of challenges; depression and anxiety are invisible and most regular people assume your lazy etc. personally I really struggle with motivation. \n\nMaybe not the best way to end but I do try and figure out what is going on deep inside? Am I like this from dysfunctional patterns from childhood, genetic, bad choices in life? Maybe after I lost my job? In a way I wish I could be like the collective and eat sleep work and watch tv and feel fulfilled... \n\nI\u2019m glad I found your post! It\u2019s really tough to talk about this stuff and I\u2019ve noticed my family kind of would rather not hear my darkest thoughts. \n\nJust remembered; I had a friend back in college and he was severely depressed and would refuse to hang out sometimes and I didn\u2019t get it. I would really try to encourage him but not make him feel guilty. Years later when I experienced depression, I understood where he was coming from...",

It is like telling a men with broken legs and arms to just force using them and it will magically get better with time. Guess what? No it wont, it needs a proper treatment, a surgery, bone setting, bandage, drugs, rehabilitation etc. Help of doctors and other people.\n\nWe are meant to live as hunter gatherers in social groups of many people, having friends and lovers always with us, getting physical activity everyday, being part of community and providing for it.  Our current society and way of living is killing us and giving us this \"civilization diseases\". Yet everything the people do is blame the sick and tell them to fix themselves.",

My health is suffering because of it, both physical and mental, not to mention feeling chained in place. I recently self-harmed for the first time in my 9 years of struggling with this stuff (physically, aside from binge eating). A doctors referral was literally a phone number on an easily located webpage. A doctor tells you to take pill(s) every single day to maintain some baseline of miserable operation/function. Then using weed or psilocybin recreationally or as self-medication is frowned upon even though its no different and arguably better than pill-popping daily, and less frequently at that. So... Take drugs to operate at some baseline level for the rest of your life. Maybe talk to a therapist because apparently talking is gonna fix it..\n\nPleaSE Mr EmPloYeR cAn I HaVe TiMe Off TO dO sOMeThInG I EnJoY I KnOw I'M JuST A LoWLy AsSET.\n\nGenuinely, PIP/Disability support have never looked more appealling.... How can I even begin to take a step out of the door when I'm being beat down by 9 hours of work at the same time as my mental disorder(s).",

Well i couldn't even do those and now i feel even worse. Whats even worse is when i rarely do succeed in those things, i still feel like shit at the end of the day. It never goes away. I feel like ther's just no place for me here, it's all pointless. I can't find a single hobby that would be even slighly interesting. Going to sleep is the best part of the day, thank god i can fall asleep most of the time, if i had insomnia too, i couldn't take this anymore.",

I honestly think a lot of my depression is habitual at this point and if I had support breaking the habit I might be able to keep an upward movement on my own.

    "postText": "Is it my voice? My appearance? I've dated a couple girls I thought were decent looking, but man, I feel like people think I'm a fucking weirdo.\n\nI either feel like they're laughing at me, annoyed by me, or just completely disinterested, even when they're the ones to initiate a conversation.\n\nI'll never kill myself, but I wish I could. No one would really care too much, but my family would be heartbroken. I'm afraid killing myself would infect them with the very depression I'm struggling with.",

Maybe my standard for interacting with people is a lot higher than average.\n\nStaring into a phone or the distance, giving one word replies or smiling when I'm not saying something funny. \n\nLike, fuck off and don't talk to me, then?",

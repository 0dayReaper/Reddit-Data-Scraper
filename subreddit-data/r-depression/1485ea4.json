    "postText": "I had a major depressive episode when I was 17-19. It felt like I could not see the light of day. I got some intensive therapy and it took ages for me to dig out, even after dealing with traumatic events. But I kept trying because I'm stubborn.\n\nAs I kept going through, my early 20s, mid 20s, late 20s, still going through therapy, building up a better resistance to it, I thought that was just a dark storm in my past. My life got better. Not amazing, it still was hard but no matter what life threw at me, I knew what to do to cope even with PTSD and ADHD with depression and anxiety sprinkles on top of that fucked up mental health sundae. I assumed my depression was just chronic. Bad months then good months, those better months would turn into better years in general.\n\nThought I didn't need therapy anymore. My therapist in 2019 thought I showed remarkable progress. No more panic attacks, no binge eating, amazing progress in school, with my relationships with people. If you told teenage me this, she would say you must be fucking joking you are not talking about the same person.\n\n2020 proved me wrong. But that was okay. Didn't know my 30th birthday would be earmarked with a global pandemic. And the horrific loneliness but I focused on not letting that old darkness creep in.\n\nAnd cue in later in the year of 2022. \n\nI get news of my grandmother dying in October. She was there in my late teen years when no one else wanted to deal with me, she wanted me. She encouraged me to go to school. She thought I was brilliant even though I didn't even feel that way. I felt like she saw through my depression and nurtured the human being inside. What a treasure. She would have been so proud of me getting in grad school. She was the one that kept me motivated, can't disappoint grandma, right?\n\nNovember, a shooting at a local gay club I frequent. I usually went there almost every Saturday and have Sunday off but that Saturday I had to work the following Sunday. God it was terrifying to think even now. The people there, those were my friends, it could have been me there. People were texting me if I was okay, were you there? This safe space that gave me solace was gone.\n\nWell, surely 2023 will be a better year. I have grad school to look forward to... \n\nCue in sudden phobia to planes and travel (I have to do for grad school), stress, moving into a former drug house (we found out later), beloved friend's cat passing away, family friend with the diagnosis of cancer, horrific impostor syndrome, and now i got the news of my family cat having cancer... \n\nI just can't anymore. It's like I'm not suicidal but I just want to sleep. I slept for like 18 hours yesterday. I barely do anything fun now. I am fortunate to be surrounded by people who love me but they don't understand what depression looks like. They think I'm fine. Oh I'm in graduate school, have a significant other, I'm not actively crying, hanging out with people, so I'm like successful and not suffering from depression which could be further from the case.\n\nDepression is horrible. It sneaks behind you when you are feeling fine.\n\nI did get a therapy appointment for Wednesday.  I've accepted that I need help again. I'm overwhelmed but I can get through this. After all I'm stubborn. And I got to dedicate my thesis to my grandmother so I need to do it.\n\nAlso fuck 2023. \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\udd95",

    "postText": "Hello so basically I was going through a very rough patch the past like 2 weeks and my mind started doing what it does. Telling me I'm annoying, my friends hate me etc. Was crying everyday. I didnt decide to isolate myself something just triggered me at 4am one day. I went to sleep woke up and had no energy to do anything not even text my friend. I ended up ghosting most of my friends, would reply to like one of them when I had energy but then after I stopped replying to everyone. I have these friends on multiple social media and my mind did it's thing again saying they hate me so I ended up deleting them from discord because I didn't like seeing them having fun while I'm basically in this slump. Anyways it's been 2 weeks and I want to message them but it feels like it's been too long and they might've grown to hate me. I also think I'm ready to stop being like this and start telling my friends what I'm going through but what if they don't care",

My life is in shambles, and as much as i liked the isolation at the time, cause i guess i needed it, i seriously fuxked up and wish i could get them all back.\n\nSo, my advice to you, and idk how, but try your best to make them understand what youre going through, atleast one of them, so you have them.",

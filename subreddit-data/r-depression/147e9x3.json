    "postText": "I\u2019m going to keep fighting for my mental health/life to improve for one more year before I call it quits. If in one year I\u2019m in the same state as I am now, I\u2019m done. I have put so much time and money into therapy, psychiatry, outpatient intensive care programs for mental health, ketamine treatment, preventative surgeries, chronic pain treatment, you name it. I\u2019ve fought so hard for a better life despite the circumstances I cannot control. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m lonely. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m keeping up this effort for one more year and then I\u2019m throwing in the towel. I can\u2019t keep fighting to be happy and healthy anymore.",

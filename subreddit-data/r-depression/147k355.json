    "postText": "I have had a severe mental breakdown recently. \n\nI am what one would consider a \"gifted kid\", straight As, high leadership position, passionate about learning and teaching and overall pretty organised. I was pretty much always this way until my parents divorced, and I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. My parents were always supportive whether i'd fail or not, until my mums love life went down the drain, and suddenly a life full of smiles and support turned into stress-mania. I constantly felt like I was walking on eggshells around her, and I think this is what catalysed my doubts in myself. I started caring so much about my appearance like my mum did, I started putting monumental pressure onto myself to do the very best for her so that she could maybe return to normal. That pressure destroyed me and I thought exisistential/deadly thoughts all day long. I think I snapped out of it when i got top of my class for that year, because despite everything I had done I didn't feel worth it enough, I felt this sense of emptiness that I promised myself I would've never felt if only I worked a little harder. So i stopped for a while, I cared less and it worked. I found the balance. But then my final year came around, and the pressing pressure came from a different source. This time it was my dad, a workoholic manager at a big corporation (who despite this, actually did really shit in high school) him and his family relished over my big \"scholarship\" (it was more like a high achievers program for high school students at a semi-prestigious university in our state) and now from every direction I was getting praise upon praise, \"Wow! Your gonna take on the world someday, you'll get into a big university and blablabla...\". I wish my dad didn't brag about me, but he was conditioned to believe that good school= good life despite the fact he knows it isn't true, plus I have a sneaking suspicion he likes putting me as the \"trophy kid\" to cover up all his shitty mistakes. This sounds stupid but I hate it when people give me compliments, praise, anything. For me it's just extra pressure, to live up to this persons expectations. \n\nSo now im in my final year of school. I thought I could handle it, I really did. I am getting the same grades that I got a year ago, the only difference being that I have so much pressure on me. I though I could handle that. But i cant. Now im stuck here, cant work because im on the verge of tears all day, in a constant state of anger rage and jealousy at anyone who gets near my level, and incredibly overwhelmed by everything, despite the fact im still doing well. I still have a perfect GPA, but im fucking destroying myself over every little criticism, and at this point it isnt something I can laugh off with my friends, now im thinking about ending it all again, dropping out or otherwise. I need help. I am destroying my life from the inside because of this artificially inflated pressure.  \nI apologise if this rant belittles any elses sense of self of self, or their family/school situation. This is just my feelings, and I needed to get it out somewhere.",

At the end of the day most employers don\u2019t give a hoot about your GPA. \n\nIt was a hard adjustment for me to accept failure, but once I did it made life a bit easier. I was able to take some pressure off myself when I learned that it\u2019s ok to not be successful at everything.\n\nI would suggest talking with your dad about his expectations and express how him bragging on you etc puts a lot of pressure on you. If you can take advantage of your schools mental health services, or seek out some sort of professional help. \n\nBased on how I read this you are a college senior?? Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong",

I used the terminology GPA as i thought it would be easier for everyone to understand. Its still a thing here (or at least at my school) but doesn't matter nearly as much as it does in the USA (as far as I am aware) Over here what matters the most is your ATAR, which allows more university opportunities and such, but as soon as your 21 no one even bats an eye to it anymore, which I guess is pretty similar to the USA in the end! I am trying my best to accept my failures, but I think what I really need is to see a therapist. I haven't seen one regularly since last year.   \nEither way, thank you for your reply. It means the world to me.",

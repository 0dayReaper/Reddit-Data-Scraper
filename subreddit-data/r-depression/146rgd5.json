    "postText": "I am not sure if this is the right subreddit for this. I feel uncomfortable with my family. My brother (M28) and I (M18) are not the closest but not distant either. The thing about him is that he could be very supportive of me one day and then the next day he could try to control every aspect of my life. Because of this, its hard to trust him. My parents also try to control every aspect of my life somedays and other days they are chill. I have a somewhat complicated relationship with my parents because I feel extremely awkward with my dad (M60) for some reason and I have avoided him (I know it sounds bad but I feel very uncomfortable around him for some reason). I do try to confide with my mom (F53) but she does have a temper and tells everything to my dad if I don't tell her not to.  (She calls this \"tough love\") My brother and my mom always get weirdly annoyed when I spend time on my laptop and phone. My dad pressured me into staying home for the first two years in college because he \"didn't want to risk my academics\" if I went to college and partied with my friends (which is crazy considering I get extreme anxiety when I have to attend any social gathering and I was never popular in high school so I don't have many friends). I know you might think they are concerned about me but I really feel like I don't have any control over my future. I originally selected my major to be Accounting for College but apparently my parents didn't like it because it didn't \"pay well\" and wasn't \"prestigious enough\". Then, I chose Cybersecurity because I knew my cousin chose that but I don't really know anything about Cybersecurity. Add the pressure I faced in high school when taking advanced courses and I was almost stressed out all the time. As a result, I would have my door shut sometimes to process my emotions by myself but my Dad thinks that it leads to mental illness for some reason (couldn't provide me any evidence about it) and says that I can keep it closed when I am changing or sleeping. Keep in mind I have done nothing wrong and just want to process my emotions. Also, I have noticed my parents treat my brother so much better because he is \"older and more experienced\" and sometimes I feel very excluded in family matters. I know I am very privileged to live a life without poverty but I am still not happy. There is nobody my age or any friends that live close to me. I don't know how I am going to make it to next year without going crazy. ",

    "postText": "I got ECT treatment (Electro Convulsive Therapy) which lasted from the end of October 2022 till the end of December 2022. It was extremely intense. I was hoping it would offer me at least some relief. I can honestly say it seemed to have an affect for a little bit, but I am almost right back where I started. I can't stand being alive and this miserable. It erased a lot of happy memories, but kept the evil ones.\n\nI have recently started a (part time) stressful non profit job that treats it's employees like absolute garbage, but then preaches how important mental health is, but refuses to give us more than TWELVE DAYS UNPAID off per YEAR. I make less than $15 an hour. I feel powerless, voiceless, and easily replaceable. It is not sustainable and I can feel myself slipping. On my days off, I just stay in bed and sleep. I have no energy. I have no money. I have no happiness. The only thing that is getting me out of bed are my precious animals. I can't bare the thought of leaving them, but I also can't bare the thought of continuing to live so miserably day in and day out. I don't want to continue living anymore. I am just so miserable and sad all of the time. \n\nMy other part time job is terrible. It is retail and I have a horrible boss who doesn't like me. They have been subtly cutting my hours, thinking that I wouldn't notice because of my memory problems from ECT. My meds don't seem like they are working and I am maxed out on all the dosages. I don't know what to do right now. I can't afford therapy, I am in debt. Why should I even try to continue? I think about suicide every day, several times a day. Sometimes for hours at a time. \n\nMy ED is out of control. I binge and purge all day long. What kind of life is this? How can I continue on living...",

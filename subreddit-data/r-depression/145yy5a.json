    "postText": "I'm sick and tired of feeling this way. I have battled with depression since the age 8 years old and I don't deserve to be tormented. I didn't ask to have depression and it makes my life a living hell. I am 23 years old now and I have survived one suicide attempt when I was 18. I feel like I'm on the path to another attempt and I would like to at least give myself a chance to prevent another attempt if I can help it. I'm so sick of feeling this way. \n\nDepression. Fuck you. I FUCKING hate you.     ",

            "comment": "I am also sucidal. I made a weak ass attempt to put myself in a coma once, yeah that didn't work. Anyways for me, medicine helps. I also try to note the things that do make me happy. For me, it's the animals I have around the house- cat, dog and now, an axoltol. They bring me great joy. If you can afford it and take care of one properly, I highly recommend an animal companion. Maybe a dog? You could take it for walks, the exercise might help.i also try to get out of the house despite the anxiety it gives me. I feel like shit if I lay in bed too long. Even going to a different room helps. Also a classic is diet. Eating healthy sucks but it helps literally anyone to feel better. Change has to be long term, they have to be lifestyle changes. Not 'I'll eat healthy for a week or a month then stop.' I do that too often, I'm still trying to get it right. Anyways, you get the point. Start small, take the little successes where/when they happen and keep putting one foot in front of the other. You're right, you don't deserve to suffer but it's up to you to do whatever you can to help yourself. You are your own best friend.",

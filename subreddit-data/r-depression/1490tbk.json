    "postText": "I was deep in depression for \\~10 years starting around 5th grade, but have been what feels like out of it for about a year now. I've been on that self improvement grind and have been forcing myself to focus on my life one day at a time to make sure I don't fall back to old self destructive habits.\n\nIts been about a year since I've done any sort of self harm and over 2 years from my last suicide attempt.\n\nThis is the best I've been in so long, but I cant tell if I'm actually back to baseline or lying to myself.\n\nI swore I was out of depression, but the more I think about it, I don't know if I really am.\n\nNot a day goes by where I don't have intrusive thoughts about self harm or suicide in general.\n\nMy emotional state seems to have gone from just pure sadness and hatred to nothingness. All my emotions just seem, idk, fake I guess.\n\nStill nothing brings me any feelings as strong as when I was a kid. Its like a distant memory of a state of mind.\n\nI remember laughing until I cried, feeling extreme love for people, enjoying food and disliking others, feeling scared, feeling smart...\n\nIts just so dull now. Laughter nearly seems forced now. Everyone is just kind of the same to me, even close friends and family. I can tell that the connection I have is special, I just don't FEEL it. All food is the same to me now, no likes or dislikes, just stuff to eat. This theme seems to carry over into every single portion of my life.\n\nI don't really have any long term goals, and the ones I do have will probably get shut down during the upcoming climate wars.\n\nI will keep living to experience life, I just wish it would be the same as before depression.\n\nAm I just overthinking this?\n\nIf anyone has advise or experience with this please tell me if it ever goes away or if its just something that's now stuck with me until death. I really hope not, this world has so much potential but I'm just stuck in mental limbo it feels like.",

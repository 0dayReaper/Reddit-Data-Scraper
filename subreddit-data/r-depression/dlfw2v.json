I just experienced this with a project I was working on, although it might be down to my other mental disorders. But the second I found it unsatisfactory, I dropped it. My drive was gone. My enjoyment and excitement from working on it was no longer there, or rather it'd been wavering for a while.\n\nAnd now, I just don't know. I have too many things to count that I've been into, and would love to start working on again. But it all seems unapproachable and insurmountable. Oh well, just another thing to add to the pile.",

But then I have one awful morning where I feel more tired than death (e.g. today) and I just give up and stay home. I've fought past it before, but it's becoming rarer and rarer to succeed these days. It's just too exhausting, especially when there is no reward other than not feeling like a useless shit.

I have wasted almost a decade of my life doing absolutely nothing of worth after high school. I started a 2 year programme this year and hopefully it will lead somewhere. Still, I very often think about how the fuck I could have just let almost 10 years go to waste, 10 fucking years! It's eating me inside. If I was given the option to go back 10 years in time there would be absolutely no hesitation. I am 28 years old.\n\nAlso, I have been lying to my family for 10 years about going to college. They think I have a degree and a stable job. I never should have lied but I have always felt like such a big disappointment that I couldn't tell the truth. It's been going on for too long for me to come clean. It would be an extreme embarassment for my family. My parents are from a south asian country where status and shit like that is a huge part of the culture. I have two sibblings, an older brother and a younger sister. Older brother is the complete opposite of me, has a masters degree and is CFO for pretty big company. My younger sister is 9 years younger than me and in her last year of high school and is doing excellent in school, straight A student and is definitely heading for a very bright future. I am the ONLY fuck up in my family which makes me feel worse.\n\nI live a double life basically. My family knows nothing of my situation but my friends do. My friends don't know that I've been lying to my family for so long. My friends all lead very stable lives. Most of them are highly educated. I feel like I can't tell them, they have no big secrets like this of their own and would think I am absolutely pathetic. I mean hell, I think I am pathetic! I live in a nordic country where I have had all the oppurtunities but still managed to do nothing! People in other countries would risk their life to get to the country I live in, to have the oppurtunities I wasted..\n\nI have stage 4 chronic kidney disease. I've had problem with my kidneys since I was a child. I don't need dialysis yet, but I expect I will need it in 10 years. I don't know how my kidneys are affecting me physically. The doctors asks me every checkup if I am feeling alright. I feel like I always have been feeling, which is alright. I don't know how I would feel If I had healthy kidneys as I have never had it... I often think about \"When am I gonna wake up and my kidneys are not stable enough?\" I hate it.\n\nI have played with the thought of suicide, but I will never do it, I can't stand the thought of doing that to my family...",

If anything it was my selfishness of not being able to be honest about my failures due to the disappoinment I would cause my parents. Their reputation wouldn't be that badly affected tbfh. They have two other children who are excellent at life.  \n\nMy actions were mostly about me not feeling shame and bad about myself because of how my parents would react. I care too much about what they think.   If I were honest I would have to listen to their negative shit all the time though, which is the main reason for my lies. I don't know how I would have handled that. Like I said, I've been pretty much a disappointment my whole life, they don't say it straight to my face, but I hear in how they speak about me to our relatives and stuff, even my older brother.\n\nTheir disappointment would be 100x worse if they found out now than had I been honest from the beginning. Think about it, they have been lying because I told them lies.  They probably would have have told lies to other people if they knew the truth, but at least it would be their choice to do so....",

I can't kill myself-I'm too needed to do that to my wife, which is, so far, \\*barely\\* enough motivation-but I \\*feel\\* like death-oblivion-that total annihilation of the need to do anything or be anything-would be such a relief. There are people who care about me that I know I'm important to, but I still feel cripplingly lonely. Knowing that is almost a burden-I'd rather they didn't, that way I wouldn't feel obligated to stick around and act like everything is ok. I don't feel seen or heard or wanted or needed. I don't think there's anyone who \\*misses\\* me-like really, really wishes I was around, or would miss me if I was gone. There'd be hurt and disappointment, but they'd be fine, and they'd get over it, and in the meantime they barely notice whether they see me or not. I fantasize every day about getting hit by a car or killed in a freak accident. I was recently in the most beautiful place I've ever seen and all I really felt like doing was casting myself off the cliff.\n\nYeah. I get it. Every minute is a struggle. The burden of performance is so heavy. I barely remember what happiness-somewhat consistent happiness, beyond an orgasm or a sugar cookie or an alcohol buzz-feels like.\n\nYou're not alone. I wish knowing I'm not helped, but I even feel, oddly, a little more pathetic. Like I've lost one of the few things that qualifies as unique or special because so many people feel the same way. Sigh.\n\nI feel...like a ghost whose body forgot to die. Trapped and hopeless in this meaningless existence. Doomed to keep marching until death finally takes me.",

I didn't take my life when I was really depressed for not hurting my parents, and in the end I'll probably end up doing it anyway. I think I've given myself a lot of time and if things haven't improved already, they never will. At least I can say I tried.\n\nThanks to a person, I smiled for a few weeks, I was not cured but it made me see life with other eyes. At least it was a relief and allowed me to see that sometimes even someone like me can have affection for their existence. It's a pity it was so ephemeral. It's the closest thing to a consolation I have. I know that life could be beautiful if I wasn't sick and if several factors came together, but it's very complicated.

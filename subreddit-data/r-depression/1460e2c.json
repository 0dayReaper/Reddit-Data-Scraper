    "postText": "Okay. A really really pretty girl rejected me for going to the cinema (not my first time) but that was not the problem... She told me like 4 times in the same day, in my face that I was not for her and.. that's okay I said \"we can be friends\" palming her back (sorry for my eng) and she said \"TOO MUCH PHYSICAL CONTACT\" and.. okay... She told me in that way 2 times that I was like shit... And I felt like she in the past suffered from a kind of abuse and me... I was raped at my 8 yo... So I didn't say anything. My mom and her family (I have a really great relationship with them!) Was really drunk so I didn't say anything. Later we come home with my mom... She went to sleep and the girl started to send me stuff like I'm not for her.. I'm ugly... Stuff like that... (Me M24 and she F20). The next day I cried in work... The next day I could sleep nice by my thoughts... And 3 days ago I took 11 Clonazepam pills of 2 mg like candies. I was FUCKED UP at the next day, I fall off to the ground and we went to my psychiatric and... They offered me stay some days there but I said no, that was not a suicidal attempt. So now I'm fine. I bloqued her from any social media. It's a really pitty because we started a really really nice friendship but.. shit happens. Stay happy ppl. Wish me look in my career (I study the Pharmacy Technician career, I'm on my 2nd year)",

    "postText": "I feel so alone in my depression. I\u2019m 20 and neurodivergent so I can\u2019t really keep a job. I stopped going to college (community college) because I couldn\u2019t get any of the work done. I can\u2019t drive so I\u2019m stuck at home all day. It\u2019s not like I\u2019d have any money to fill up the gas tank anyways. I see everyone around me have at least some sort of a life no matter how depressed they are. All I do is sit in my bed all day in my unkempt room and look at my phone. I used to love to listen to music, but now I\u2019m not even interested in that. I feel no motivation to do my laundry. I sometimes feel like a horrible person, like the life I live right now is all my fault. It doesn\u2019t help that my depression is also tied to Real Event OCD which makes me feel like I\u2019m not going to lead a happy or successful life in fear that my mistakes will come back to haunt me. I feel stuck. There\u2019s nothing to do other than wallow in my sadness all day and occasionally hopefully distract myself by scrolling through dumb videos. Has anyone else felt this way before? Any success stories?",

Having no real friends to count on holds me back the most because why would I want to drive anywhere if there\u2019s no where to go. Sigh. I have zero interest in anything but my crocheting. It took me a whole week to finish my laundry and by the time i did it already piled up and it\u2019s like why am I such a failure bro..my psychiatrist is setting me up into an intensive care program which is therapy about a few times a week. She says in the state I\u2019m in its what I really need right now, support and care. Perhaps if you have access to mental health support you could look into that but I understand not all of us have that ability sadly",

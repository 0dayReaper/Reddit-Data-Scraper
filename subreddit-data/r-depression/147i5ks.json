    "postText": "I have been jobless from like 8 months now and am really srruggling to get jobs. I had a good paying job before, but now am just highly depressed. I am underconfident in skills, abilities, everything. And procrastinating a lot too. Am wasting my prime youth. I have a lot of shame facing people even, don't feel worth.\n\nI am still stuck at home and a burden to my old and ageing parents.",

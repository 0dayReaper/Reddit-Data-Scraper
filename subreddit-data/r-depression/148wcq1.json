    "postText": "Being a firstborn, in campus with no financial assistance is hell. You bend the whole day and in the evening you sleep hungry. The little I get I have to take care of my siblings (14F and 12M). I struggle to buy food, pay rent, pay school fees for them etc. \nI've tried reaching out to friends but I  feel like I have bothered them enough. \n\nI've cried enough and I'm tired. I'm always there for everyone but no one is ever there for me. Funny thing these kids I'm tired of taking care of are the same reason I cannot commit suicide. There's no one to look after them.",

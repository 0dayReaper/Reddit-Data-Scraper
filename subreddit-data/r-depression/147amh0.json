    "postText": "I'm going through a really tough time with my friends, and it's been weighing me down from being happy. I am 14 years old, and up until recently, we were all happy and friends. We always enjoyed each other's company and had a lot of fun together.\n\nAt first I just played a simple harmless prank on them in our Minecraft realm. I cheated as a joke. We decided to stop the realm till 1.20. When the new Minecraft version came out my friends created a new realm without telling me.\n\nFeeling left out, I reached out to friend1 and asked if we could play together. His response hit me hard. He said, \"No, we're all playing without you.\" I was sad and confused. I couldn't understand why they didn't want me to join them anymore.\n\nLooking for answers, I turned to friend2 and asked why I wasn't allowed on the realm. They said, \"You'll ruin it.\" Next I asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d. Then friend2 responded with, \"Hacker man.\" I immediately tried to explain that the cheating incident was just a joke, nothing more. However, their response crushed me even more. They said, \"Sorry to say, but nobody really likes you.\"\n\nI felt rejected and hurt by my some of my closest friends. It's hard to understand why they suddenly feel this way about me. I know I made a mistake, but I genuinely apologized and never intended to harm our friendship. I just wish they could see that.\n\nRight now, I'm left feeling lost and unsure of what to do. I wiish I could have an open and honest conversation with my friends, expressing how their words have affected me and I am looking to understand their perspective. Maybe there's a chance for us to work things out and rebuild our friendship. If anyone has any ideas of what I should do lmk.",

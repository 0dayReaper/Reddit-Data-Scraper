    "postText": "Hi. I (f26) have had depression for over 10 years. At times it\u2019s under control and others it\u2019s not. Last week depression was beyond bad and I was really not good. It has gotten better (maybe) but I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s still there just presenting different. I have zero motivation, low energy and anxiety in a physical sense. \nCould this still be depression?",

And with that in mind, I\u2019ve tried to ID coping strategies, as well as things that make it worse. It\u2019s a total pain in the ass.\n\nI\u2019ve started to do this thing where if I know I\u2019m feeling low, I\u2019ll just try to move. Walk, run, yoga etc. I used to use drugs/alcohol/porn to distract myself, and while not perfect, I ultimately realized those things led to more harm than good in the long run. Still struggling sometimes, but there\u2019s a path forward at least.",

    "postText": "I've been going through a lot of shit recently and I just am so emotionless and can't even cry anymore. I just feel like no one cares so why should I bother. I feel like I'm not enough, I just wanna lay in bed all day, it's not like I'm gonna accomplish anything. My parents probably think I'm a failure. Everything I put so much time into I can never be good at, I won't ever have a purpose.",

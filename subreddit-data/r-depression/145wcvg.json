    "postText": "For the last couple of weeks I've been having this feeling that I'm living the last years of my life. I'm 28 now and I don't really see any point in living past 35. I don't see myself being 40, or 50 years old. People around my age tends to consolidate a career, have families. I fantasize pretty often about parenthood and family life, working my dream job and stuff like that but when I look the reality around me the possibilities of achieving those things feel more distant and unreachable every day. I've been single for 11 years now, and I've only had sex with prostitutes throughout my whole life, which filled me with guilt and hypochondria for a long time, and has definitely determined my sexuality for the worse. I have a masters degree but I have been only able to find a job as a clerk at a bookstore, from which I was fired in February and been unemployed ever since, moochin' off my parents like a loser, like a complete and absolute and pathetic failure. Meanwhile I look at everyone around me and everybody seems to be thriving, going places, loving and being loved, but I'm just rotting away alone in my apartment. I can't concentrate on anything, I can't get myself of the brain fog I've been stuck in for this whole year. We're at the half of the year and I haven't been able to do anything. I applied to a postgraduate program and was rejected so the remaining months of the year will be probably wasted in minor projects. I went to therapy for the most part of my twenties and I took antidepressants for some time as well, and at one point those seemed the right things to do being in the state I was, but now I'm not even considering it. I can't afford it and even though the therapy and the meds did help I don't really know if they were worth after all. Currently I don't even feel like I could hold a job, being steady and function like a normal person, plus I don't even hope to find a job that pays well. The only thing I feel, the only impulse that grows in me is to get away, get lost, become a drifter, go homeless until death eventually finds me. I just wanna disappear, fade away, going to some place where nobody knows me, I just wanna go and not tell anyone. I just wanna hurt myself and I just want to feel pain and disappear. I remember that when I first started having suicidal thoughts I remembered my family and how awful they'd feel if one day I just killed myself. But right now I'm past that, I don't have to endure this suffering out of consideration for anyone else, specially since no one really cares, no one ever talks to me, no one ever acknowledges my existence most of the time. And this whole situation will stay same for a long while I reckon. But anyway, sorry for such a long post, just venting a little bit, I hope you're all right, I don't know if you've been through this or felt like this before, I'd really like to your replies on this, because I hadn't felt this urge to hurt myself in a long time, every day I just feel like I'm a hanging from a very thin thread and as the days go by I care less and less if that thread just breaks.",

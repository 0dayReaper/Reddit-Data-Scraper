At 35 I am completely alone no friends nothing no social life and I have back pain and skin problems which makes everything worse. I feel like I was born by mistake.

I also have no friends or social life right now. \n\nThe fact that you feel this way is not evidence that you were born by mistake. Humans feel like absolute dog shit, it's part of being human and it's not evidence that there is something horribly wrong or different or broken about you, even though it might feel that way. \n\nI find it helps sometimes to be around people, even if I'm not really interacting with anyone in the crowd, sometimes just being in the environment with a lot of people can help me feel less isolated. My go-to's are climbing gyms because I really like the vibe, and it's nice to be around people with similar interests. But rec-centers are also good, basically anything that you can join in. What do you like doing?\n\nAnd what do you think is causing your back pain? Some strength training starting at the appropriate effort level could probably help, same with light cardio and stretching. \n\nI think the ability to be happy and enjoy life can really come in waves a lot of the time. And if you're feeling down and stressed out about a bunch of things, it makes sense that enjoying life isn't coming easy right now, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible.\n\nIt's also possible that your antidepressants aren't working for you and could be making things worse and it might be a good idea to taper off and see if you start feeling any better by doing that.",

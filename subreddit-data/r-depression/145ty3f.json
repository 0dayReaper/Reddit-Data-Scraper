    "postText": "Normally this wouldn't really bother me. I'm kinda desensitized to this kinda stuff after being online for so many years. But probably 2 weeks prior I opened up to him about how I had serious thoughts of ending it. He seemed reasonably sympathetic and understanding as the time. Didn't think much of it.\n\nFlash forward to about 2 hours ago; we're playing a game of league of legends online together. I'm not good at the game at all, I just play because he does and I want someone to socialize with essentially. Long story short we lost the game and he instantly disconnected from the voice call we were in and typed out that I should kms, saying I have no ambitions in life and I should just make it easy on myself among other things. Just went on a complete rant. He's literally never said anything like this in the few years I've known him, I'm convinced he only said it because of me opening up to him earlier.\n\nI know that I should just leave him alone and never talk to him again, but I still consider him my best friend and he's really the only person I talk to right now. I don't really have anyone else.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.",

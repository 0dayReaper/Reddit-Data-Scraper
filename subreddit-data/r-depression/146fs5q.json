I think its just because I have made the decision to kill myself soon and I don\u2019t really care about myself anymore in the in between period. I haven\u2019t been eating as much. I ate a muffin today and that was it. I truly am just wasting away.",

It's getting bad haven't shaved in 4 months. Nobody understands. Nobody gives a shit. I learned that they all end up going away. Even my ex gf after I helped her so much with $ so much $. She's nowhere to be found when I need help lol.. doesn't really matter anyway",

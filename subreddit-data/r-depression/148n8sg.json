If you go back in my life, I\u2019ve had those feelings of hopelessness worsen. And there\u2019s a certain point that I specifically remember which started those feelings.\n\nI think it started for me when I had a teacher when I was 7 who singled me out and made me feel dumb and yelled at me and nobody else. She was so nice to everyone but me, and I specifically remember a lot about that year.\n\nDoes there always have to be some event to trigger it? In other words, does it need to be traced back to a source?",

    "postText": "Being suicidal is like being on a really terrible night out. I'm having a terrible time but my friends and family are all enjoying it so I stick around. They're the ones that invited me and said I'd have a good time. But as time goes on, the desire to leave just gets stronger and stronger so I try to distract myself by getting some more drinks to make it a bit more bearable but I still really just want to leave. But everyone is telling me that this is a great night out to be on and that I should just stay and try to enjoy myself. But I'm not enjoying myself. I'm just numbing my annoyance at not being allowed to leave with drugs and alcohol. I've got to the exit door a couple of times but I couldn't get any further than that. What's more annoying is that while I can get help to make the night out more manageable, I'm not allowed to just leave. I'm stuck here. It feels like this night out has just turned into a prison sentence.",

Like, cool, thanks dude or dudet I might feel slightly less socially awkward but the next day there is nothing but the hollowness inside of me due to your hollow-ass interaction with me. Thanks bruh. \n\nThen begins party part 2, where you're invited but if you don't accept it everyone 'hooks' you in on it and brings it up, even if you give the generic I have work/school/kids/illness..etc... Becuase either you simply have obligations that cant be scheduled with another party, or you just dont want to fucking go.  But if you fail to go....congrats you've been promoted to \"OUTCAST\". Fucking shit--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso this is mainly for the American culture, as we are super fucking social to the point where is makes our neighboring countries uncomforable.

            "comment": "I definitely feel this some times.  I often got stuck at parties IRL too back in the day and couldn't leave as I had no phone and couldn't drive.  Now that you mention this as an analogy for being suicidal it hits so close to home.  I feel like I'm waiting around for things to just get better and even trying to make things better but am met with fear and anxiety which leads to depression and anger.  There was a time I got stuck at a party because the guy who gave me a ride to the party ended up hooking up with this girl and they ditched me and went back to his place to smash leaving me stranded at the party.  I didn't end up leaving until the next morning.  I was literally one of the last people to leave even though I wanted to be the first and I was too anxious to just ask someone if they were leaving and if I could get a ride.  Finally one of the last people offered me a ride and took me home.  They went like half an hour out of their way to take me home.    \n\n\nThe reason I mention this is because I feel like in terms of suicidal thoughts I am the last one left at the party now.  My mom passed away from cancer when I was 12 then I lost my sister to a sudden heart attack when I was 22 and then at age 28 I lost my dad to Cancer as well.  Everyone has left the party and I'm just stranded and alone only this time there's no one left to drive me home.",

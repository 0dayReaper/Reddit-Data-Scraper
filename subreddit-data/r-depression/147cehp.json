    "postText": "I know I just posted here, but it's all too much. I've always been the therapist and the parent of my friend group because I'm so happy and caring. Because of this, now I'm suicidal and I have no one to turn to. I should be happy, I should be better, but I'm not enough.\nI want to die.\nThere are several ways I've thought of to do it.\nBut I'm too pathetic to go through with it. I want to be dead.  Every time I cross a street with someone and a car is going to go right through the crosswalk, I contemplate jumping in front. Then I think about a joke I can make about getting hit by a car, but I realize it's not really funny because it's true. \nI have such a great life that I don't deserve.\nI'm ungrateful if I stay and I'm ungrateful if I kill myself.\nI'm too fucking young for this. \nI thought I had a full life left.\nBut maybe I can just die now.",

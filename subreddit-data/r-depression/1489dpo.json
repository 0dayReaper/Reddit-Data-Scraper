    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nHere to vent. I am diagnosed with GAD and  clinical depression. I'm on medication and in therapy. \n\nFor the past 3-4 weeks, I've been in a hole. Honestly, not even close to the lowest. I've been mostly disinterested, irritable...not getting things done like I usually do. \n\nMy husband unleashed on me tonight. I do nothing to help. I'm not doing enough with our daughter. I don't provide for my family. A rage filled rant and character assassination, really. He genuinely thinks this is a choice and I'm just lazy. I've been on my medicine almost a year and I'd say the last 9 months have been very stable and positive. Not perfect, but much more predictable and less low lows\n \n Admittedly, I have been pretty crap at keeping up with chores. I normally do most cleaning/laundry/childcare duties. I do also work and provide for the family. Last year I made half of his income...still a respectable amount after taxes..\n\n4 years ago I gave up my career to follow him abroad for his dreams. We got back last year and I restarted my business..but had a solid year. This year is going even better...probably will make 2/3 of his salary if not more. I am struggling with finding a balance, but until the last few weeks, I have been holding down the fort. \n\nThe way he spoke to and about me was devastating. I know I have plenty of flaws. Im already my own biggest critic. I have noticed how much he's stepped up and I have mentioned and thanked him over and over.. usually also self deprecating and apologizing for where I'm at emotionally. \n\nTonight, we fought in front of our daughter...which we try not to do. All the jabs...I'm too lazy to finish laundry or chores. I can't even provide for our family. I'm crazy and ruin everyone's life because I can't be happy. I'm a bad mom and my daughter doesn't like me. Even though logically I know most of this isn't factual, he knows what will hurt me the most. \n\nI think I'm especially frustrated because in the past there have been times I could barely get out of bed.\n.I'm not there. Slacking, sure. In front of my kiddo, he belittled me as a human and my mental health. \n\nI had a panic attack after it was all over and am now thinking more clearly...just had to get it out. \n\nSorry for ranting..but thank you if you read this far.",

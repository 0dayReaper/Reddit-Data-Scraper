    "postText": "Hey! So basically I\u2019ve been dealing with these symptoms for about 9 months now. It all started when I was kinda getting ready to head off to college for freshmen year and for a couple days felt those symptoms. Fast forward to move in day, the first week I felt great. Super excited, going out, having fun, meeting people etc\u2026 then somewhere after those two weeks I smoked some weed and had a full on panic attack. Freaked out and didn\u2019t wake up till 1pm the next day. All the symptoms kicked back in after I woke up that morning and has never left since. I have smoked weed in the past and never felt like that before so it was pretty weird I reacted that way. During that time I did have poison ivy all over my legs\u2026 not sure if that has any thing to do with it. Fast forward I come home for summer still feeling weird. Emotionless, not happy, anxious, brain fogged, dizzy. I\u2019ve been to the doctors for blood tests, an mri, thyroid tests and everything came back normal. I\u2019ve also been to a therapist and he wasn\u2019t very sure what was going on with me lol. I am a very healthy guy, I woke out 5 days a week, eat a well diet most of the time and have a lot going for me right now tbh. I\u2019m very frustrated and want some sort of answer. Plz help me figure this out!!! Thanks so much.",

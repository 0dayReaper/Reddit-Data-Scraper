    "postText": "I was Catholic and constantly in fear of hell and the near impossible goal of getting to heaven. I haven\u2019t believed in any religion or god for the last 10-15 years. I have grown to hate religion over the years, but having that certainty and big picture structure was comforting.\n\nI miss knowing what I am supposed to do and having a framework of bigger meaning and life goal posts. To have a context to fit the random pains and sufferings of life.\n\nNo one will give me answers to life it's up to my shit tier brain to try to figure out my life.\n\nIt feels hopeless and meaningless. I don\u2019t know and won\u2019t ever know.",

    "postText": "Life isn't going how I imagined it would by the time I reached this age (29). I lost two women I considered to be the loves of my life (dated seperately of course). I started dating my current girlfriend last summer and while I love her a lot, our relationship is far from being what I want. I don't blame her, she's hurting and so am I. Difference is, she's hurting worse. This month we were both supposed to be parents but hey life is a cruel joke and made her miscarriage despite her doing everything correctly. We both were so happy when we discovered she was pregnant but as I mentioned, a miscarriage occurred. The memory of her screaming and me rushing to the bathroom to retrieve what was supposed to be our child out of the toilet, I can't get it out of my head. It's like a burned in image to my brain. Why, why did it have to happen? I wanted to be a dad so much. Now we're too scared to try again, we're afraid to risk the same thing happening. I love children, they are one of the few pure things in the world. Life ripped it away from us after giving us happiness, how the fuck is that fair. I hate life ever since the miscarriage happened. As I said before, this month marks the month we'd both be parents. Instead, we're left with NOTHING. The day my girlfriend lost the baby, we went to the hospital and I just stared blankly at the wall. My mind was numb and basically dead to the world. I held the highly underdeveloped fetus in my hands, it was supposed to be our baby. I didn't want to let go, I wanted to just die I guess, die holding what was going to be our child. I know consciously it was far too under developed but goddammit I felt so much love for what was in my hands that day. I cry at least twice a week about it and it's been months since the baby was lost. There's a song called winter bear by Coby Grant that pretty much sums up what it felt like. It went from a dream to a horrible fucking nightmare. I get drunk every now and then these days in secret and just cry alone. As for my girlfriend, she's too busy flirting with a random man she met on my computer to notice. She plays on a role play server for red dead redemption 2 and is \"married\" to a random guy on the game and even says to him that she loves him and apparently her character was pregnant even (I don't even fucking know if that's a thing on roleplay servers). I do everything around the apartment. I clean the place, I take care of the cats food and water, I take garbage out and do the dishes. Roughly twice a week she'll cook a meal for us and clean the litter boxes but that's pretty much it. Otherwise, she can be found 99% of the time playing that game on my computer. She quit her job about a year ago and has barely tried to look for another job since. Consciously, I don't mind. After all, most jobs suck and even though we live paycheck to paycheck I know she's suffering and even now I don't blame her for not having a job. I mean, how can you possibly focus on a job when you have a miscarriage, even if it happened several months ago. I'm not mad about that at all. What I am mad about is that I've asked, I've begged and I've pleaded several times to just try spending a little more time with me and everytime she says she will but then she just brushes me aside and says \"Oh, well this is happening tonight so tomorrow works better.\" What happens when tomorrow comes around? She does it again. So, I'm left alone feeling like shit and wondering why I'm even fucking here. I'm sobbing currently, I want our fucking child to be alive, I want what was promised to me when we started this relationship, I want things to be different but I'm so weak and I'm so angry and sad. I'm sorry this post ended up being so long but I bottled so much up inside and now that I'm drunk it all had to spill out I guess.",

This can be hard when it feels more like something you \"have\" to do, when it is a relative.   Lots of volunteer organizations you could pitch in with.\n\nIf you are still in love with your husband, may I make a suggestion?  I don't know what he is allowed to have, or if it could reach him, but can you send him a recording?\n\nThink of all the best times you have shared with him.  Funny moments, lucky accidents, adversity you overcame together.  List the traits you appreciate about him.  Memorize a joke that he would laugh at, and record it.",

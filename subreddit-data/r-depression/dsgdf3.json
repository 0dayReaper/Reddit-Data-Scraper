All I can say is that you hold your own happiness in your hands. You can wake up and say I\u2019m going to just try to be happy today. \n\nAlso if your going to sleep at 3am your going to wake up a zombie. Happiness requires sleep. Easier said than done. And it requires less screen time, more water etc etc... \n\nTry to do some small changes in your day to day and see if it helps. \n\nYou seem very smart despite what you think of yourself, I think the effort is just being put in the wrong places. \n\nGood luck!",

To clarify the problem isn't that I can't articulate myself it's that it takes me ludicrous amounts of time and effort to do so. This can be a... Slight impediment in day to day conversations.  Frankly most people simply lack the patience to deal with that so here I am today haha.  With that being said thank you so much for the compliment! It made me really happy.  At the very least I guess I can explain my emotions with 6 hours of writing XD\n\nThanks so much for the advice. That's all easier said than done but I'll continue working on that. \n\nThanks so much again! Your comment is very encouraging to me!",

I would eat my lunch as quick as possible then walk around or hide until lunch was over. The one bright break came in my sophomore year when I found out that I like to read books so I would go hide in the library and read books. It took a lot of work and life is bearable now, sometimes it's even fun and interesting. I hope you find your bright break my friend.  In the mean time, there's reddit and we are here.",

Slow, thinking first before acting, etc... apparently that's killing a lot of jobs choices for me\n\nAnd the worst thing? I can't even do the best solution for me: Simply do not work. In Germany you get put into preventive measures and here I am now, needing to apply to lots of jobs in this preventive measure or else they put a rasp in my hand which I absolutely despite.\n\nThe worst or best thing is that they did an interview on a paper and I basically wrote all this (or rather you can come to the conclusion what I hate and what I can, I didn't spell it out), so they maybe realize their \"error\".",

The pdocs who were unempathetic and unhelpful,in my opinion,they moved on to other patients,hospitals and departments. I could be stuck and keep taking leave of absences and stuff but they would lead their happy lives etc. It's sad but true.

I currently am kind of disliking my job but it\u2019s better than school, and it\u2019s nice to have a choice of what to do. Right now though I dislike the feeling of having to start the cycle over each day and I want change. Luckily as an adult that finished high school if I really desire change I can make it happen. For example I could quit my job and start a new one, I could move out, I could do whatever interesting hobby that comes to my mind and I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about any school schedule.\n\nPeople say you\u2019ll miss high school, but no, I definitely don\u2019t. :P",

I certainly didn't *always* get as much done as I wanted to.\n\nSomething clicked for me last night. Maybe it was just relaxing with buddies for a bit, maybe it was some little things someone had said, my chemicals have balanced themselves out, or some combination. But I got a rush of energy last night, felt happier, and had more of a sense of *purpose* than I've had in m o n t h s.\n\nI'm going to cling desperately to this feeling. I've gotten it before and I've lost it before. But, last night, I stayed up until 3 AM not because I was down but because I knew if I went to sleep I might lose that feeling. That I **have** to cling to this feeling, keep doing things that give me it, hang with people who give me it, because if I don't I might lose it again. And, if I lose it again, I have no clue when it will come back. And, frankly, I don't know how many times I can lose it before I just give up. I was *so close* to just giving up, these last few weeks...\n\nDude. I'm sorry. I know how you feel and it fucking sucks ass. My best advice is to keep throwing yourself into new situations until something changes. Tear everything apart, really think about what it is that is going on, and then put it back together again. Hang with friends, talk philosophy or just chit-chat, or do *whatever* you think might provide that light bulb moment.\n\nI'll leave you with Des Roc's [Living Proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu6T-HPkV2k) and Dylan Thomas's poem [Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night](https://www.cgcs.org/cms/lib/DC00001581/Centricity/Domain/25/Coleman_Poem_Do_not_go_gentle_into_that_good_night.pdf). I find strength in these two works and I hope you gain strength from them as well.\n\nSalaam.",

    "postText": "I don't know what else to do, the meds don't seem to help anymore and visits to a therapist only help for a day max. All I do is try to escape reality by watching YouTube or sleeping. My moods have been constantly going drastically up and down for the last 4 years and it's just exhausting at this point. No matter how hard I try to stay in the positive mood, I always slip back down to wasting my life away. I'm failing classes, I've lost interest in the one hobby i had, photography, and I'm just creating more problems for everyone around me. I don't know how much longer I can keep going man. I know my relatives love me and would miss me if I died, but at the same time I think if I died a lot of problems would be lifted off their shoulders once they got over the initial sadness. I don't wanna die, i just wanna feel normal, but that seems like a dream at this point. My mind is constantly filled with intrusive thoughts of suicide lately and that is not helping either.\n\nSorry for venting, i just thought sharing it with someone might help a little.",

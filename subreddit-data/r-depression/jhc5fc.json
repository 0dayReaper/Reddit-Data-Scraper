But you've somehow inspired me to do something about that, so for the first step I'm going to just force myself to sit at my desk. Not too hard I guess. And then I'm going to play my favorite playlist on YouTube to make my hellish tasks a little bit fun at least. And finally I'm going to start studying for my Chemistry test -- even if I can only manage to do it for five minutes, that's better than lying in bed like I'm doing right now. And it's happened to me in the past where I started crying because of all the stuff that I procrastinated doing (love cramming before end of year exams), but I forgave myself, because I wasn't going to finish anything otherwise. It's incredibly difficult, but you have to stop thinking about what you could have done, and just focus on what you can do right now -- you have all the power to change that.\n\nMy dad always says that motivation only comes after your first action -- maybe that applies to you too right now. I feel like if I can do a little bit, it might inspire me to do more.\n\nAnyway, all the best to you OP, I know you can tackle whatever it is you want to accomplish &lt;3",

This creates a cycle of not doing anything because I'm not doing anything. I've found it best to allow my self to \"forget\" the past mistakes and look towards the things I **can** control. You can't fix past mistakes but you can plan goals and succeed in the future. So forgive your past self and work towards those goals. This is much easier said then done.",

For example instead of deciding that you're gonna clean your entire appartment that day, make sure you at least clean your desk and have that as your only priority for the day. That way you will at least not be dissapointed with yourself, and maybe you'll end up doing even more than just that tiny thing. Baby steps...",

I've been telling myself to clean my apartment for the last 3 months, \"ok THIS weekend I'll actually do it\" and of course I never can find the time or effort to actually do it.\n\nBut in terms of wasting time, I want to share my perspective because it might help. Coming out of college I just happened to be friends with a bunch of people in high school who happened to be brilliant intellectually. I kid you not that they were ALL hired right out of college to amazing companies - Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon, one became a software engineer at a coding company, another went to graduate school at Stanford. Of course I was a music major and spent the better part of a decade in the shittiest of jobs, mostly in food service. I was so depressed that this period is just one long haze in my memories, because everything felt the same to me. I would be up all night thinking the very thing you posted about - why am I wasting my life, why am I not smart enough to do what my friends are doing, etc.\n\nEventually I found a not miserable career. It's not something that I'm SUPER passionate about, but its comfortable, makes enough money, and I can see myself doing it for 5 years. Some of my friends who went to those companies are still happy, but others arent. Going to a good job didnt mean they were happy for life. What I realized is life isnt a competition for who can make the most money or be happiest. The happiest people arent competing, they're just consciously making choices to improve the chances they'll be happy. That's why depression is so hard, because it forces you to make choices that will make you less happy. So by focusing on getting a good job and fighting my depression, I've gotten to a place where I'm not happy atm, but I can at least have hope that I'll be at that place someday, and I dont waste as much time thinking about \"what if...\" I guess if I had to boil down my too long answer, it's just to say try to focus on your future as much as you can, which I get is hard with depression, but it's what helped change my mindset and keeps me from thinking about things out of my control. Anyways sorry for the long answer but this post really spoke to me because it's something I struggled with for a long long time.",

On a night time you can think \"what did I do today?\" And even if it's just one or two small things, that's something. Hopefully it will help to start forming better habits, but even if it doesn't, you can always fall back on writing a list as a starting point to getting things done.\n\nAlso, I find that allowing myself to put something off, *but only once*, works well too. \"I'll do that tomorrow\" okay, I might not, but that means I'll *have* to do it the following day.",

            "comment": "yo, i find it helpful to separate my sense of self into two types when this thought cycle happens:\n\n(1) what/how I am currently (taking into account what burden i face with my mind, taking into account the uphill battle that is depression &amp; its symptoms and effects)\n\n(2) what/how I want to be (be it tomorrow, the near future, or future self. generally the \u2018longing\u2019 for me to be productive, a functioning person who gets their shit done)\n\nwith this in mind, i often find that when I am experiencing depressive moods, ill give a substantial amount of negative energy into comparing (1), the current version of myself (lazy, unproductive, worthless. you know the common depressive thoughts) to (2), what I want myself to be like (not depressed, productive, a normal person). \n\ni find that this might be a source of the problem (comparing myself to the perfect, ideal version I have in my head, and feeling despair because I\u2019m not like that, therefore inducing the negative thought cycle)\n\nwhen things get rough and I begin feeling this way, I remind myself that logically, all the issues that mental health causes, are not going to be fixed in a day. they certainly arent going to be fixed at the moment I\u2019m feeling depressed, which allows me to cut myself some slack, gain perspective, and rationalise things. \n\nthe advice i\u2019d give to you?\n\n- you cant fix all of your issues with a snap of a finger. it is unreasonable to hold yourself accountable to the expectations you have of yourself being ideal, so dont beat yourself up about it!\n\n- don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. while its true the big black dog has possibly hindered on your life and productivity, remind yourself that you are on the journey of healing. rome wasnt built in a day, and your crafting of (1) into (2) will not finish in a day. as long as you\u2019re taking forward steps, no matter the size of them, you should be proud of yourself. the fact that you have an awareness &amp; a dislike for the way you feel now and being potentially unproductive, means that you have a good understanding of your mental space right now. you can use this as means of motivating yourself. \n\nyou got this, we all have. it just takes time &lt;3",

It\u2019s much harder to develop new skills for me than it was ten years ago. But I lost the last ten years just laying in bed, on the internet, playing chess, or browsing reddit, or watching deviant porn. I was too afraid to interact with people, because I felt like I always embarrassed myself. And I was too depressed to motivate myself into doing anything productive. I used to be smart. School was easy for me. Now I\u2019m trying to do grad school, and I have to read each page four or five times just to understand any of it. And even then, I forget everything by the next day anyways. My brain feels fried from not using it for so many years. I haven\u2019t even finished a book since 2017. And before that it was since 2015. Not only has depression basically made me retarded, I was once fairly employable and bounced around a couple of decent jobs for some time after undergrad. But none of the jobs extended contracts with me, and one of them fired me because I never did any work. I was always just too depressed and tired to get myself to do anything. And now I have a giant gap in my resume and zero employable skills. I had to move back in with my parents, and I\u2019m 28. Figured I would give grad school a shot, but I\u2019m already fucking up. If I don\u2019t start studying this instant, I will fail, because midterms are this week, and I know next to nothing as of right now. This shit sucks so hard. Even if it gets better, I\u2019ll never get those years back. Ugh, I wish I had the courage to kill myself.",

I was too depressed and believed that I was not good for anything after graduating college. I accomplished nothing. That was until I finally decided to take the antidepressants that my doctor had prescribed for over a year. I had over a year's worth of pills by that time because I thought I would be a weak person for having to medicate. Anyway, I had had enough, took them as prescribed, and within two weeks I started waking up. I started working out, decided what I really wanted to pursue career-wise, actually pursued it, I started defending myself from bullies at work, and I slowly started becoming the strong person I know I am. It's difficult to describe except the way I mentioned. I felt like I was waking up and crawling out a hole. It's still a battle but after two straight years I finally got off them and I am still fine even during this pandemic. I know that if I start slipping again I will immediately start them back up because they are my pushers. I'm not telling you to medicate, that's up to you, but I want you to know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and what's on the other side can bring so much growth. I hope you find your light.",

Then one day I just decided I can't keep feeling like this because it doesn't fix the problems or regrets so I called a doctor made an appointment as soon as possible to get on some meds to at least get to a state were I can progress and started acupuncture for depression aswell wich apparently is not really effective but I found it helps me and then just started saying dumb shit and fucking up by telling girls I met in public they're cute asking them out/getting rejected and convincing myself that atleast i had a go because of all those times I didn't, all my youth wasted alone im not letting that happen again and I'm done being a pussy and hell yeah im scared but I'm sick of letting people walk over me too regardless of whether I win or lose the next guy that pushes me around I'm going stand up for myself and fight no matter how much I want to run away from it, its not fair to yourself to let others make you feel like that. Also trying to disagree with people alot instead of being a yes man gets respect because it means that you value your beliefs therefore your self. Also eating better/working out helps cooking meals for my sick father every night trying to bring him back to health helps keep me on track. This is what I've been working on recently anyway but it all started with a physchologist and some meds and that's what has helped me get on track anyway but it is POSSIBLE just sometimes you need help starting. This is what has worked for me so far and everyone is different just don't wait any longer it gets ugly/worse and you get to the point where you truly and I mean truly hate your self wich is tragic and you deserve better you know you do, you OWE yourself better please get help and don't give up ily.",

Im sorry your not as fortunate but please just do your best and try to take some actions to keep moving forward even just the smallest step each day no one should feel like this its just too sad. I just know how frustrating it was and for me I don't necessarily enjoy the meds but it just stopped the gut wrenching feeling I use to get when I thought about my value as a person, the self hate, the mistakes I made, all the decisions I never made, all the time wasted and worst of all having to wake up in the morning and then I would remember it all again and be literally seathing with with rage I would scream f@@ck this as I drove to work the meds atleast numb those feels and slow the thoughts then I could make progress. there's lots sad stuff that happened too but I'm sure you've got enough of your own problems to be worrying about mine. I'm just so sorry that you can't get the help that you deserve and idk if your thinking of trying meds really think about if you want to do it for a while atleast. It was a last resort for me I had already given up.  Goodluck I'm going to sleep and wake up tomorrow morning and I will think of you to get me through the day because it took alot of strength to openly write out what you have I don't know if I could do that myself back before I started getting help your stronger than I was",

I am usually such a positive person and can hold.my own, but once I have to get used to things going bad for a more than desired time, I literally switch from one extreme of strength to a total extreme of complacency and lack of care or concern about anything, and just want to stay in bed till I feel better. With a 3 year old, plans to build a mini home from a bus, and get my nursing license as a travel nurse and even things like Dr appointments - I have no time to relax. Ever since this pandemic thing I just feel I can't keep any order or routine which is so necessary to tackle your goals with a plan. I'm just feeling so foreign to myself.

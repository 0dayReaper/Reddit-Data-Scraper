    "postText": "I used to self sabotage and act rather callously. I still do somewhat, although I\u2019ve become more mindful. When I used to feel depressed I felt like I had a reason. Like my anxiety. Or the fact that I drank too much last night. Or that I was self deprecating all day. Or because I spoke/acted on impulse and suffered the consequences. While I still have very bad anxiety, my medication has started effectively dampening it. I\u2019ve also started having fewer ideations in general, and I\u2019ve been trying my hardest for the first time in my life to help myself get better. I stopped drinking almost completely (I sometimes have one/month), when my friends do illicit activities I opt out, I\u2019ve taken away specific triggers, I\u2019ve found a way to hold myself to a flexible eating schedule. But I\u2019m noticing that by doing all of these \u201cgood\u201d things I am starting to feel worse, because despite everything I am still depressed. I cannot stand in a single place doing nothing without feeling it. I can\u2019t go to work without feeling it. I can\u2019t have a day off without feeling it. And it\u2019s causing some of the worst thoughts to start coming back, except this time I don\u2019t have a crutch, and I still don\u2019t have any motivation or hope for the future. Is there anybody here who has gotten better after trying to reroute their life? Is it possible?",

The trick for me has been saying to myself, \"I'm experiencing a depressed thought/feeling\" and \"I'm expressing a content (or happy or joyful) moment.\"\n\nAdded: I'm 66, I have a lifetime of depression. Learning this reality of minute to minute change has helped me. While I wish I'd learned it sooner, I now have hope for the rest of my time here.\n\nIt takes a lot of practice, and it's not easy, (especially at first) but for me it has helped a huge amount.  \n\nI owe a therapist a huge amount of gratitude for teaching me this.",

Stopping with the escapism is very confronting, and it takes a lot of courage. \n\nI think that once you've had a depression, a part of it will always be there, you will never be the person you were before. That is a painful realization, I'm sure that's true, but it is not necessarily a bad thing. The trick is coming to terms with depression and your thoughts, and find other perspectives with the same thoughts. Depression will always be lurking in the shadows of your life once it's been there, and you should always be careful with it. \n\nDon't take anything from me as a fact, as I am struggling at the moment with my depression, I have not gotten rid of it. I also use a lot of ways to escape from my life for moments, I also became a heavy drinker. I personally think if you have the courage to face your depression and stop running away with self sabotage like you did, you have a great chance of changing your life.",

I knew I was going to die soon, if not by my own hand then by a situation I engendered. I turned to cbd workbooks. I had been in a hospital group for it before but couldn\u2019t mKe myself attend regularly. The workbooks I found were the same as used by the hospital. It didn\u2019t work the first time I tried but I kept going back to it and eventually it clicked. I no longer overthink or dwell on conversations. I know this will pass. I found emotion regulation helped too. It changed my life. I will always suffer from anxiety and depression but I do have tools that have helped so much and changed some things in my brain seemingly permanently. I\u2019m down now due to an unavoidable situation but my books are there and I have tools and exercises memorized to use anytime. I highly recommend for ANYONE as so many of these things aren\u2019t taught by our parents or the school and though I knew my negative thinking and over analyzing was bad I couldn\u2019t stop until those books.",

I liked having all three but it would be fine to start the basics with one. Some exercises won\u2019t work for you. You have to find the ones that do.

Things happen, you make the best decision you can, something else happens, and you just keep going. The only things that matter are the moving forward and the letting go. I've found there's nothing to heal \"from,\" there's things to heal of course because of what's happened, but the \"thing\" doesn't exist in the first place. You can't grasp it or hold it, even if it seems real. In my experience, it hasn't been \"depression\" becoming part of me, but losing parts of myself that used to sustain me but are no longer there, so I'm duct-taped together to keep on surviving. One day maybe I'll be able to make something new that'll fit those old holes. Fit, not fill.",

But  I think it also helps to keep doing something each day or week to try and self-improve (be it self-therapy or some other self-development). That way you're resisting the drugs etc. to take away the pain, but you have another non-drug activity as a reward (sense of achievement, progress). I'm also resisting alcohol when I can (except for when I'm happy in social occasions) and taking baby steps in both self-development and self-therapy. It's still hard as every 2nd day it seems I feel depressed. But at least if I look back, I can reflect on my positive character strengths and that I'm gathering evidence to show myself that I'm making progress.",

If you have an appropriate dose, you get a calm mind, and can do things without your body fighting you on it.\n\n* read a Google Scholar-findable article you can get off of Sci-Hub called Self-Determinaton Theory (by Deci &amp; Ryan, iir); also after that, read about Free Energy Principle.\n\nMight get you off your ass and feeling good. Get a sense of Self-Efficacy, then you can feel good.\n\nAlso, for social, you can read:\n\n* How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie\n\nand for a \"you can do anything\" realistic mindset (keeping in mind that it's pretty much impossible without sufficient medication for your ADHD physiology though):\n\n * Think and Grow Rich, by Napoleon Hill\n\nalso a couple few newer books:\n\n* Mindset (you can find it on libgen.rs) by Carol Dweck\n\n* The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane\n\n* So Good They Can't Ignore You\n\n* Deep Work\n\nhope this helps. like I said, I'm not an expert. I do hope this helps though",

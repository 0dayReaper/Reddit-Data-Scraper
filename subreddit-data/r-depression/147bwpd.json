    "postText": "Anyone else? I started off a great day, wondering how I can even complain. Journaled, hung out with friends, had a great time. Came home in the evening, made food, showered and cannot be bothered to do anything else on my to do list. I\u2019m just tired. Don\u2019t want to be here. Reflecting again on my day, I don\u2019t really have close friends. I do but I don\u2019t. At the end of the day, the only person we have is ourselves. And that\u2019s pretty lonely. Hate my job but can\u2019t quit ($). Now it\u2019s going to be Monday again.",

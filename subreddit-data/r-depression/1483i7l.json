Except they never directly told me. I had feelings that they were talking to someone else but they\u2019d never admit it. Then we got into a minor argument one time n she broke up with me cause she said she didn\u2019t like something I said. N that hurt me for a few months cause I thought of myself as a shitty person for doing that. But the thing is I stayed her friend and she eventually started entrusting me with stuff and I learned that people she was into recently was people she was flirting with 7-8 months ago(when said feelings of her cheating came about. She also doesn\u2019t think before she sends things so I think she forgot what was also going on at the time when she told me) what I learned from that at least is to not blame urself. It\u2019s just how people are now with how easy it is to connect socially over the internet. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a great woman.",

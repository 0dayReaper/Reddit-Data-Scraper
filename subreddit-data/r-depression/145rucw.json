    "postText": "I\u2019m 20, I\u2019m an immigrant in Canada, just graduated college. \n\nI\u2019m trying to get into the field I have a diploma for and that I\u2019m passionate about, but to get job opportunities in this field you most of the times have to be in a union\u2026 and to be in the union you have to have Canadian residency. I only have PGWP and to get said residency I have to work at least one year at a job that requires my diploma. \n\nI am not close with my family, so they don\u2019t really help me neither financially (though, my grandma gives me around $300 every month), nor mentally. My mental health is straight up shit; I\u2019m drowning in a depression quicksand that is full of su!c!dal thoughts. And I would go to therapy, but I cannot afford it. \n\nI\u2019ve been working 2 minimum wage jobs (part-time) that don\u2019t give me enough money and only make me even more miserable. Soon (in 2 weeks), I\u2019m moving to Toronto in hopes to find better opportunities, but I\u2019m scared that all I\u2019m going to find will be unbearable rent prises. And it\u2019s not like I already have a credit card debt that is currently my priority. \n\nI\u2019m not asking for help or anything, mostly compassion. I hate my life and I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing. I feel guilty for being depressed, I don\u2019t think I deserve success or love and  I hate myself more and more every f*cking day \u2026\n\nI\u2019m just crying writing this bs",

I'm sorry to hear that, it must be tough living on your own - especially with rent as it is.\n\nYou mentioned that you could afford a therapist. Would it be possible if you only see them once a month? I think you'll find that even that frequency could help.\n\nIn regards to moving to Toronto I think it might be a good experience for you if financially feasible.\n\nI know depression is no fun but at the end of the day we are who we are. All the best to you!",

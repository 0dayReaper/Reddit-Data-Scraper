    "postText": "I guess I\u2019m just wondering if anybody else on this sub ever felt the same, but I\u2019ve been feeling a bit better lately after probably a 4 or 5 year deep depression. I\u2019ve found myself uncomfortable with showing happiness to the people I\u2019m close to, it\u2019s almost like my subconscious is trying to uphold persona of being sad, because everything else feels so unnatural. I\u2019m also experiencing this sort of unkillable urge to feel better at all times, which sounds good on paper, but in reality it just feels like this weird mix of grief for all my lost time I spent depressed, and a constant want to make up for it. Overall, it just leaves me constantly feeling unfulfilled, feels like nothing I do will make up for wasting away my late teen years.",

    "postText": "Hello sub, I'm 20yrold\n\nIt all started in 2020 when covid struck the whole world . It was good at the beginning because we were having online exams and plenty of holidays. \nLater in months passed like this and I realized I have lost the habit of studying . I was good in studies before. I lost my concentration. Before it all began I was preparing for an enterance exam for college. And it became quite obvious that I wasn't able to get through because I didn't study much. \n\nAfter, I wasn't able to get through all the overthinking began. Now,I took up a course and I'm in a college not the course I was preparing for earlier. \nI constanly find myself degrading myself. I am afraid of everything g coming my way for eg simple college exams .I take lot of stress for it because I want to do good then I'm not able to do anything and find myseld in a pit.its ike my self talk to me has become so destructive. \n\nOn the top of it, my mind constantly pokes me with the thought that were gonna die one day - whats all this for? I have startes fearing death, losing my close ones , I struggle being open with anyone.  I have lost all my friends. I don't talk to my family. My studies it has gone miserable. I liked one guy but we have to get seprated for some reason . I dont find any fun in life now, it all seems so forced like I'm running on a   path and a path I don't want to follow. I always have this feeling of emptiness no matter what I've achieved or got- it's always there. \n\nI frequentlly think of giving up on life . It's strange but yes on one hand I ve fear of death and then on other hand I want to give up entirely. Even when it's steaming 40\u00b0C here I go days without bathing or combing my hair. Most of the time of the day I spend sleeping. in morning, I really don't feel like getting off the bed. \n\nThere's not a one aspect of my life from which  happy. Then the thought that because I wasn't able to clear enterance -ima faliure it goes around my head 24 x7 idk what do I really do to overcome this feeling\n\nI try distracting myseld but that is all shortlived and I find myself in this always. Its been 3 years I've been living like this, I really want this to get over because of tired of feeling upset,disappointed, unmotivated ll the time.\n\nI have thought of  to psychiatrist but I just dont have courage to. Please  help",

But i would say you should stay strong and work hard as much as you can and be confident i guess.And do regular staffs on time (Eating, Bath  etc).. And try to spend some times with your beloved persons.. Hope you don't mind taking advice from a failure",

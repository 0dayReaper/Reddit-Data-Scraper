The first thing the doctor offered was to write him a sick note, so X amount of time off work, but he's refused it.\n\nWhich made me wonder, is it actually worth having time off work to get some rest but possibly be left with those unwanted thoughts rattling around or is it better to just keep going into work because it gives that distraction/routine and structure?",

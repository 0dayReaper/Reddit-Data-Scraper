    "postText": "A friend took me on a free trip for my birthday (like first class island vacation, not my typical hostel/couch surfing affair). I know I should be happy and grateful. I wake up every morning hours before the alarm filled with dread and anxiety, my heart racing and struggling to breathe. I cry in the hotel room even tho I can see the ocean from the bed. I'm literally on a once in a lifetime trip and can only find glimpses of enjoyment here and there. I know it's not really feasible to just force it, and I'm doing an ok job of masking I guess...any suggestions on making the best of the next 36 hours?",

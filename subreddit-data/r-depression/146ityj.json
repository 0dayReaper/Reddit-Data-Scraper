    "postText": "I feel like my disinterest is kind of going above and beyond some others\u2019.  I don\u2019t mean that as a brag or to try and win the \u201cIm sicker than you\u201d game.. I say it because I\u2019m worried.\n\nIt seems like a lot of other depressed people I know in real life have their comforts.  TV shows they watch or music they listen to or books they reread.. places they go sometimes.\n\nBut I have nothing. I\u2019ve written lists of TV shows to try and watch but I can\u2019t make it through a single TV show.  I\u2019m not interested in video games or my art or seeing friends or listening to any music at all.  It all just feels like noise to me.. and before I know it, I finish my chores for the day and I\u2019m back in bed sleeping.\n\nNo motivation or interest.  Not even in relationships.. as I\u2019ve had people reach out and I just can\u2019t even picture myself being a good enough partner in any universe.  I can hardly convince myself to eat and shower (some days I dont\u2026)\n\nI\u2019ve never been like this before but this past year it\u2019s been becoming more and more apparent and it\u2019s starting to drive me crazy.\n\nDoes this go away?  Are you the same person after all of it?  Does interest actually come back?  Passion?\n\nI\u2019m on meds and they help with energy but the energy is useless because I have nothing to spend it on. \n\nDo you guys know how to get through this?  What is recovery like?  Can I even have a functioning life?  \n\nThanks for reading.. I appreciate you all.",

I don't feel good enough or just plain boring with my depression the way it is. I'm on here because I want to open up to those who are going through it like I am. I think talking about it helps but I don't like opening up to the \"normal\" people, if that makes sense.",

You do things that offer value and some things will make you feel good or bad and from there we adjust. \n\nGoing into a task expecting to feel something = instant loss",

If they don\u2019t then it\u2019s an off day and theyre better a few days later.  But it never ever just works for me and it probably never will.",

My psychiatrist suggested I start doing things I used to enjoy  anyway, like watching a show I loved, eating what used to be my favourite food, listening to music I enjoyed, etc. The interest comes back, and in the meantime, it is still something that occupies your time, time you spend not sleeping. Don't try to pressure yourself about really paying attention. Go through the motions at first. Interest will come back.",

It's good to be able to do something you couldn't do before..\nAlso going vegan or something if you're not already makes you \"feel\" like you're a better person \n\nI might be too optimistic but\nI hope I didn't say anything inappropriate",

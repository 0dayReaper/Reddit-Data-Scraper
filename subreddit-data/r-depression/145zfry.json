    "postText": "June is men\u2019s mental health month have you noticed that nobody else has posted about it? But if it was about women will be a whole different story. I bet half the men look at this i\u2019ve never heard June as men\u2019s mental health month because I guess it\u2019s not as important as pride month. 1 man every 60 seconds 1,440 men a day 77% of all suicides are men and sometimes I stay silent because nobody cares. I don\u2019t tell people my problems anymore because nobody can fix them. What are they going to do, tell me it ok when it\u2019s not,they tell me they understand when they don\u2019t and I don\u2019t like who I am there\u2019s nothing good about me anymore. I\u2019m sick of wasting my time. I\u2019m wore out I\u2019m really tired I don\u2019t know what happened to me and all I want is to be happy again like when I was a kid and had no worries. People ask \u201cwhy did you stop smiling, your smile used to lite up rooms you\u2019re joy was infectious it used to ripple through crowds, you where the embodiment of mirth and cheerfulness an oasis of happiness in a  world that often seems shrouded in gloom I remember you\u2019re eyes twinkling with the secret promise of a joke you\u2019re lips always curled upwards in anticipation of laughter, I remember your energy how it seeped into the air making the world seem a little brighter a little better\u201d. I tell them the world weight was to much the demands of life the pursuit of dreams the battle against the clock stole my joy. I wish I could tell them I was ok. That my happiness matters that my smile is missed. I wish I could they\u2019ll them to hold on to their laughter, not to let the world dull there spark. I tell them to take a pause and take time to breathe and relax it\u2019s ok to step back from the race, to find your joy again make a beacon for those lost in the chaos because the world needs your light, your laughter, your joy.",

You\u2019re either a troll or in serious need of some help. \n\nYou\u2019re not being honest with anyone or yourself. And we can\u2019t help until you do.",

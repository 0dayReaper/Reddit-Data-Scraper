    "postText": "I can't and don't want to continue living.  The world would be a much better place without me in it. \n\nIf Im gone, my parents don't have to waste their money on me and can spend all of  it on my brother. My close friends may be affected but I don't know. 2 of them I hardly talked to, in a long time. The other 2 would be fine without me. We are going our separate ways in life anyway. I have other friends but I have only known them for 2 years. A lot of my behaviour with them was a mask. So that wouldn't be a problem. \n\n\nThen there's my ex. She broke up with me but we are still friends.  Honestly it's kinda complicated.  She truly loves me but we can't be together.  I do think she may be affected a little but she can move on. \n\nI just want to disappear and the pain to stop. Haven't even reached proper adulthood and mentally destroyed.  Can't imagine it getting any better.",

Why waste the chance to try. You won\u2019t get to try again. Keep pushing harder and harder until you actually give out. It\u2019s like going for a run or working out. There is a wall you hit. But if your life was REALLY on the line you could push much more than on a regular work out.",

            "comment": "Hey, I'm sorry you're going through a rough a lot of pain. You're not alone because I have struggled with these same thoughts and feelings for a very long time. I too want to disappear where no one knows me. I have thoughts of not wanting to be around and feel worthless. I've also struggled with thoughts of unaliving myself.   \n\n\nBut I PROMISE you, your parents want you to be around and I'm sure your brother does too. You not being around will significantly impact them more than if you being around. Depression is horrible but it is manageable and you can find happiness. Therapy helps. I still struggle with these thoughts, especially recently, but I can manage them better now. Things can get better but you have to want it to. I wish you all the best OP!",

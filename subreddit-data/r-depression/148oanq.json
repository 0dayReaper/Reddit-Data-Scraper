I feel like I\u2019ve backed myself into a corner. committing suicide only sounds so appealing because I can just explain everything in my suicide note. I don\u2019t have to change, I don\u2019t have to get better, I don\u2019t have to explain any further past that. I can just die and hopefully whatever happens afterwards is better than this shit. well, not really sure why I\u2019m posting this since it\u2019s more just me admitting that I\u2019ll probably kill myself this week. oh well. don\u2019t have anyone to talk about it to. \n\nhope you\u2019re having a good day.",

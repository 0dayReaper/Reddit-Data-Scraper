    "postText": "I remember back in my early years, I'd have these abstract visions in my mind of what I believed reality was, and I'd associate intensely rich feelings with those visions. Predictably, reality always came up short, but even today I still have hope that I can enjoy an experience that matches a level of intensity that those visions accompanied.\n\nWatching anime in my teenage years gave me an illusion that I could feel the richness from those visions again, to which I generated assumptions in my head as to the nature of why those shows existed, which laid the foundation of my attempt to climb towards this summit in my mind. Of course, my introduction to the nature of marketing and demographics eroded that foundation, and I was back to square one.\n\nBy then, I asked myself \"Why did I feel so passionate about those visions? What was I chasing?\"\n\nI dug deep into the roots of my memory that night, trying to recall those feelings from the visions. Once I extracted a sample, I dug even deeper, attempting to unearth an actual memory that I experienced. A memory that brought me the same intensity and warmth from my visions.\n\nThen I remembered. It was 2006, I was eight years old at the time. Me and my mother just moved in to a 1 story house after traveling across the country. While I was accompanying her in the backyard during gardening, I hugged her tight around the waist, and I pleaded with her: \"Mom, I love you! Please let me hug you forever!\"\n\nThen she told me: \"I love you too, but remember, people need to move around so they can eat, work, go to the bathroom, or garden.\"\n\nI was disappointed, but I understood, and promptly let go. Ironically, I can count the amount of times I've hugged my mother on one hand, and she's been in my life every year I've been alive, even after I moved out. And we're not exactly on bad terms either. Even after all that's happened (I'll get to that in a second).\n\nIn any case, I believe, subconsciously, that ever since that hug in 2006, I've been chasing after anything and everything that could potentially give me that intense warmth I felt. That feeling of security and bliss. However, since I was somewhat hyper-sensitive to people, even when they weren't talking to me directly, I refrained from going out of my way to seek comfort through people, and let them come to me instead. There were many times where no one came to me. And although I was upset, I accepted it. The people that came to me came and went, and while there were fun times, our connections felt spiritually weak, and I remembered the bad times more than the good.\n\nThat said, I chased after security and bliss through paths of least resistance. TV, Anime, Internet, and (eventually), P*rn. My parents reaction to my discovery of porn triggered a cycle of self-hatred and inadequacy that still haunts me to this day, especially since they don't go out of their way to talk about what happened by any means. Even worse is that I bought it through pay-per-view, and got scolded about how their entire paycheck went towards paying for it. My desires and self-esteem were at a cross roads. And I believe they still are.\n\nThe older I got, the harder it became to recreate those visions in my head, even harder to feel the richness associated with them. Artificial entertainment was the new reality. So much so that my dreams started to revolve around it, with perceived reality being a secondary character at best. I feel something, but this is more akin to bitterness draped in artificial sweetener rather than true richness.\n\nGrowing up, I always felt envious of people that had more stuff than me, more opportunities than me. I wanted just as much stuff as they had, and I held that bitter, vile feeling close to my heart like a badge of honor for over a decade.\n\nOnce things got so bitter, I had the disturbing idea to use credit cards to buy a giant gaming pc from Amazon, as well as quite literally everything else I saw on Amazon that I felt like I wanted. Once I reached my limit, I called my Uncle that lives across the country and insisted that he send me money in order to support a \"future project\" of mine, in which I'd pay him back later. He was reluctant at first, but gave in after I talked him into it some more. I used that money to pay off my credit cards and buy more stuff. \n\nAll in all, I sunk over $30,000 in the pursuit of empty materialism, and am still paying it back to this day. I brought shame to both sides of my family, and the decisions I made in that timeframe are at the core of my self-hatred.\n\nI wanted to throw up every time I walked into my room and saw the PC I bought using that money. So much so, that when it broke down and needed to get repaired, after I turned it into a repair shop, I never came back to pick it up, to which the repair shop canceled my order and kept the PC for themselves (which I wanted them to).\n\nI've been working in warehouses ever since graduating highschool. And I used it as an opportunity to prove to the world \"I DESERVE TO EXIST! I AM NOT A FAILURE! VALIDATE ME!\", and would always say yes every time I was asked to stay past closing, even if I absolutely hated everyone I worked with. In one (very small and unorganized) warehouse, I navigated the workplace politics to become someone that was essential to the warehouse functioning properly, in the sense that the whole operation would collapse if I wasn't there to lead workplace functions and time orders correctly, since I convinced everyone there that I was the only one that was smart and practical enough to do very specific things (I didn't feel bad about tricking them since all of them were gaslighting hypocrites, to which I decidedly used their tactics against them). Of course, this took a burden over the course of 3 years I worked there, and I quit after getting COVID. The place I work at now is a bit more organized and treats me with respect (on top of better pay), but I still missed that messiah complex from the other job.\n\nReflecting on all this now, I wonder what my current workplace sees in me to trust me enough to promote me twice. When I look inward, I see a monster that craves validation and short term pleasure even at the cost of others well-being and the destruction of self. A daily practitioner of all seven sins that skirts by on account of everyone competing with him being slightly worse by comparison.\n\nAs much as I hate myself for what I've become, I've never backed down on my hedonistic tendencies, and have always charged ahead like a bullet train, running over everyone in my path. The chase is the only thing that matters.",

I\u2019ve tried so many meds, not sure if any of them worked but I have two that I mainly take, but most of the time not. I\u2019m not sure what it is about taking medication, but I can\u2019t seem to get myself to take them for long periods of time. Maybe I think they don\u2019t work, maybe I don\u2019t want to get better. I take them one day then don\u2019t for 2 weeks. They\u2019re obviously out of my system, and I want to feel better, I just can\u2019t routinely take my meds. Anyone else?",

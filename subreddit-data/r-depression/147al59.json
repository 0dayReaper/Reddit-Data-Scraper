I know so many in this group are going through far worse than I, but I\u2019m have a really rough day. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever cried this much or been this upset in my life, and I\u2019ve been through some crazy times for sure. Without going into extreme detail, I\u2019m having major family problems. For context, I\u2019m 30F and ever since I was a kid, I\u2019ve been carrying a lot of weight in terms of my parents and their personal issues. Depression and anxiety has been impacting me since I was about 7-8 years old. I\u2019m really not confrontational and hate conflict, but I\u2019ve been looped into their issues from little on and acted as a middle man for lack of a better word. When I was little, my light at the end of the tunnel and motivation to continue  was the thought of being an adult as I thought that would solve everything. I walked on eggshells for years and often had a sense of fear which I don\u2019t think should ever be put on a child. So much unfolded today and my father, who has been a best friend to me (sounds twisted, I know), stated he wants nothing to do with me moving forward. I don\u2019t have a lot of friends and, aside from my parents, most of my family has passed away or they are very distant. I\u2019m not really one to post on here, but I\u2019m really feeling alone and would love to chat with, not just those who may be able to relate, but anyone who is feeling hopeless, alone, or just needs a friend. Thanks for reading, it truly means so much.",

But when it was night time I could never manage to sleep... This is gonna be really hard but if you can't sleep even though you're supposed to GET UP AND GET AWAY FROM YOUR USUAL COSY SPOT, because your brain will associate this place with these feelings of despair and physical sluggishness.\n- I'm guessing that sometimes you get up (to go to the toilet or whatever). Go into any other room, for instance, want to get a snack? Take a few steps to your bathroom first, then head towards your kitchen. Feel extra adventurous? Look outside your window, maybe even open it. If you are comfortable with going out of your house, try to take a walk.\n- when you lie awake on your bed and your mind keeps spiraling out of control (aka you're telling yourself that life, especially yours, is not worth it) try to describe your surroundings. (Around you is a chair, a bookshelf, a pile of clothes...) maybe even try to do that out loud? I actually wrote a song and I sing it whenever I'm about to boverwhelmed/ feel the panic attack coming.\n- say whatever your telling yourself out loud. Because we don't realise how harsh those little voices are being when they're in our head. Try to say it out loud! Do it! Often I couldn't do it because I thought I was being ridiculous but that just proves my point: it made me realise how irrational those voices were.\n\n\nI know it's easier said that done. I realise everyone is different. But we can do it! I'm still definitely not okay with my existence but I'm much better... I hope you become too",

Sleeping Feels Like the only escape Where I don't Have to feel a thing as i don't experience any kind of dreams while sleeping It just feels the best way to pass the time. Day by Day My Interest In anything Is Just dying And I feel like Time just passes By. Slowly Slowly Each Little thing that i liked A while back seems Pointless or either Not so important.I used To listen To music Loved To Have debates On various issues But now all It seems like they are not worth while.\nPlus My sleeping schedule is totally Fucked up. Now i tend to sleep During the whole day but if i try to change it And Stay awake During day and try to sleep At night i'm just unable to Get myself Down to sleep at night. DAY by day It feels Like Different Parts of my body are failing me and I'm just feeling Irritated And Agitated at every little thing. PLUS i always have This lingering Feeling that like I'm Getting Worthless as each Hour passes sometimes i just want To end It But i just can't i don't wanna go as a Person Who gave in To suicide. I sometimes Think why don't i just get down mysteriously so that it all ends.",

She suffers from depression too.\n\nBut we and our amazing son and fantastic friends keep us good as can be.

If the act of suicide isn\u2019t considered brave then the act of not doing so can\u2019t be cowardly imo. That\u2019s called being a human being, it\u2019s in our instincts to avoid dying. Who would legitimately wanna kill themself without the assistance of depression or suicidal thoughts? Literally nobody. Anyone would be a \u201ccoward\u201d if you said here\u2019s a gun do it. \nI get suicidal thoughts too and I\u2019ve sobbed at the pain of living &amp; sobbed at the lasting pain that I would inflict on others, because dealing with a death is absolutely horrible &amp; nobody ever gets over a death even if you think the loss of your life is not worth caring about people will care for a long time. \nThe fact that you are alive is brave, you are putting other people\u2019s happiness above your pain and that isn\u2019t an easy think to do. You are hurting, you are struggling and this shit is hard for us. If you are alive even though you are suicidal or struggle with depression that\u2019s so difficult and so brave. You are not a coward, we are not cowards, &amp; we are capable of growth and someday we will not only be able to stay alive, but actually want to be alive. You are stronger and braver than you realize.",

After all being a teenager with no friends is pretty hard, no one I know can relate to me and it's hard to talk with others. If I do my feelings deteriorate and disappear because I see just how incomplete I am. Everyone is talking about jobs or what they want to do in life. I can't think of any other thing to tell them except happy. So I stay quiet, dang this actually got off topic sorry there.",

Depression can be a real bitch, and hard as hell to climb out of. So my advice would be to start small, give yourself one small obtainable goal each day, even something as simple as brush your teeth or take a shower, which can even be hard when you are depressed. Then add on another small goal. And do that each day.\nOr try doing something nice for someone else, sometimes it makes you feel better, like write a letter, or drop a dollar on the sidewalk for some unsuspecting person to find, make somebody cookies or some shit. \nAnd get some sun, even if you just sit there for a few mins. Close your eyes and breath in that awesome fucking sunshine. Check out some nature. That shit's amazing. \nAnd most importantly, remember, if you are still here on this earth you still have a purpose here, so don't give up. Not everything makes sense while you're living it, but some day it will.",

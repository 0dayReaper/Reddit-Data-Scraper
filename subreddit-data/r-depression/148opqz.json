I hate waking up everyday realizing that I\u2019m still alive. I just want a way out of this stupid cycle that I\u2019m in everyday. \n\nI don\u2019t even remember the last time I was happy for an ENTIRE day. I miss when I was younger I was always so happy even when I would get sad I would be happy again in less then a minute.\n\nI hate myself.",

And, I hear you on how it feels like a bad thing to not want to be here anymore but I also get how you'd want the cycle and the pain of hating yourself to be over. That is so draining. What would it be like if you could again feel like perhaps you used to about yourself, when you were younger and happier?",

            "comment": "I have chronic depression and have had depressive thoughts for as long as I can remember. I am 25 now with my earliest memory of suicidal thoughts being 10. I was very aggressive and angry growing up which make sense now. I have felt true happiness just this year as I was laughing and carrying on with some friends of mine. I was once at the place you are now , where nothing interested me and I just wanted to sleep and be left alone. Honestly the first steps were the meds on I\u2019m to bring me towards a lighter place. I am still on my journey of healing, but therapy has made tremendous impacts on my daily life. It helps to get coping ideas from someone that studied the psychology of the brain. You have to find a way to let go of the pain, trauma, etc. and fill the void with what makes you happy. If you\u2019re not ready therapy doesn\u2019t have to be an option it could be talking with a trusted friend or even as simple as journaling what your going through.",

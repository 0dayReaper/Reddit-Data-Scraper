    "postText": "I've been told that it seems I don't want to get help. That's not true though. I'm just terrified to talk about my feelings to my parents. My ex thinks that I just don't want to get better. It makes me feel like I've made zero progress since we broke up but that's not true. I've made good progress that I'm proud of. I'm just scared to let my parents know what I'm feeling and it's making me feel worthless. I started shaking when I was going to try to open up to my dad and I actually did open up slightly to my mom for the first time a few days ago, but I don't think it's enough for my ex to feel proud of me for. Do you think it's my fault I haven't gotten help or do you think that I don't want to get better. This has been eating away at me.",

Rape you? Blow up your car? Get you fired from your job?  Tie you up and torture you?\n\nOr, is the actual, sledgehammering FACTUAL REALITY that there is nothing they can do to you unless you CHOOSE to let them?\n\nWhat tangible BENEFIT would you gain from discussing your feelings with your parents? What is the EXACT GOAL HERE? What is the rational logical plan?",

                    "comment": "Sorry about that, \n\nFor the who and why- my ex gf that I'm still in communication with. During our relationship I've struggled with mental health issues such as extreme moods swings, self harm, and irrational anger. Stuff like that. I was pretty bad to her and I'm trying to get professional help to show her that I want to get better for both myself and for our relationship \n\nWhy im terrified of my parents- I'm not too sure. This is a topic that I've never brought up to them. Both my mom and dad have seen me self harm scars and my mom made fun if me and called me an idiot. My dad wad a but nicer though and just looked at me weird and asked me what it was. I've never rrslly felt close to any of them so it's not something I'm used to either. I'm scared of getting yelled at or in trouble. I feel like my mom might hit me or something or publicly embarrass me (like she did last time) and I'm afraid that I might tell my tad when he's having a bad day (which is basically every day) and he'll yell at me and I will cry.\n\nOne other reason I haven't asked for help from them is that when my sister started self harming. My mom dragged her out of the house by her hair while whipping her with a chord and she still has scars from my mom's nails and I don't wanna have to go through that. My dad also took my sister out of therapy after she attempted so I never saw the point since if SHE LITERALLY TRIED TO KILL HERSELF and they took her out of therapy. I doubt they'd even consider putting me in therapy. \n\nI only want to open up to them (even though I know there will be little to no benefit for me) to prove to my ex that I want help (which I do). However, the truth is I won't be able to get help until I'm an adult and can pay for my own therapy. I hope this helps and thank you for reading :).",

Don\u2019t feel shut down or rejected by negative responses, if you feel you\u2019ve made progress that\u2019s all that matters. The people in your life cannot physically see changes that are happening inside yourself. It sounds like nobody genuinely cares for your well being so never take their commentary to heart. You know yourself more than anybody",

And when you get away from them, NEVER contact them again.\n\nDo not be rash about it however, plan carefully and be genial to them, so they won't know what's going on. \n\nWhat your ex is right about, is that this is your responsibility. But you also need help and support from someone you can trust. \n\nYou can seek support from groups, at school, church, etc. If she doesn't know your background of why you're afraid of your parents, I would suggest opening up to her about it.\n\nYou can also check out Patrick Teahan on youtube, on how to heal. But you also need people in your life who loves you.",

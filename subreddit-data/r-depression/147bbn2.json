I see people younger than me in relationships and going out and having fun and it makes me feel so jealous, I feel pathetic for it. I just want to be a kid again so I could finally be happy again.",

As children, we never think about success because everyone is content to enjoy life, but adulthood ruins it with the pressure to succeed. It's as if we degrade from children into adults. I'm sorry you feel that way. Everyone secretly yearns for childhood, though some more than others.",

I feel for OPs post but in my case, it\u2019s just that I really do feel unprepared for adulthood. I\u2019ve already considered as of this moment, not to have kids or a family of my own (I\u2019m gay from a traditional religious family, I also have an older brother who will carry our family name). Long story short, before my thyroid diagnosis, I stopped school multiple times due to hypokalemia/sudden paralysis. I come from a 3rd world country, a little bit of strict Asian parenting (but I love my parents. I miss my dad and love my mom). When I got sick, the strict parenting was now out and expectations on me disappeared. I\u2019m no longer an overachiever (not the top of the class but used to be an honor student until HS). Life was so easy back then, I grew up upper middle class in the countryside (one of the few who can afford my own laptop a decade ago). Now look at me, thanks to the pandemic and my overall health, overweight (but not obese), only job exp was a freelance ESL teacher (I loved doing it since it was audio and it wasn\u2019t stressful at all until the company couldn\u2019t afford to pay the teachers anymore). I passed my licensure exam as a teacher (in my country\u2019s standards) recently  but still struggling with job hunting. I\u2019m at the point I don\u2019t really mind minimum wage, just let me find a place to belong and do my own profession or take the first step in an actual job. My batchmates already have a life and careers, I try not to compare myself but it\u2019s hard when the discussion is planning a reunion and traveling when I can\u2019t afford it",

Adulthood is definitely worse and much harder. I hate having so many responsibilities that I struggle to accomplish every day and I don't even have my own family and kids. I can't imagine how it would feel to have to take care of someone else when I can barely take care of myself. \nWhat I do to feel better is I think about things that I loved in my childhood that I could still find time to do now, like listening to music, or playing a fun game, or watching an old show / movie on a streaming website.

People talk about a mid life crisis. Whatever - the quarter life crisis is a real thing and looking back on it, it was the hardest time of my life. Seeing friends of mine in different stages than me (getting married while I wasn\u2019t, succeeding in their jobs when I hated mine). \n\nAnd now I\u2019m past that stage of life. It DOES get better. There is light at the end of this season for you. \n\nAnd I can say that even with the trials of life that have still come my way. And there have been plenty (my wife is a recovering alcoholic who has severe health issues because of it). But, I have 2-3 very close friends, two healthy children, a wife whom I love (I love her and I see her past her addiction). \n\nYou can \u201clook forward to looking back\u201d. I look back on my early twenties and am thankful that I made it thru it. You will too. Hang in there.",

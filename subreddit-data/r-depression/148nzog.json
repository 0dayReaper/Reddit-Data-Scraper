    "postText": "My younger self would be so disappointed if she ever saw me. She would be disgusted at how much of a failure I became. I was so happy back then. I was a straight A student and I loved life. I wasn't a burden. I brought people genuine happiness and I was innocent. Now all I am is a mistake. A pathetic loser. A depressed loser who spends all day overthinking and being an asshole. I'm useless and I'm so so pathetic. I used to have confidence and I was never ever insecure. I never thought I'd be depressed but look at me now. All I think is about suicide and how miserable I've become. I'm disappointed in myself. Everyone I used to care about left me. I know the friends I have now will leave me like everyone else. I know my partner will leave just like my ex. Nobody cares about my problems and how I'm feeling. Sure, just blame it all on me because I don't have any feelings right? Keep calling me a useless mistake because I am one aren't I? I'm done with life. Who cares if I were to jump in front of a truck or if I keep cutting myself more and more right? Because deep down, nobody ever cared how I've felt. Yeah, I smile a lot but that doesn't mean I'm fine. \"You deserve to be depressed because you haven't been through shit\" is the most common thing someone has said to me. I just want to give up. I really do. My life is worthless. I don't matter to anyone. Besides, everyone would be happy if I died right? Everyone would simply forget I even existed. I've been feeling suicidal and numb. I'm so pathetic. It's been 4 years and it hasn't gotten better, it's simply gotten worse. What's the point of even existing if my purpose is to be a failure",

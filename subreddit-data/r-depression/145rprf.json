    "postText": "I had a dream I died. All I could see were the people looking down at me in the ground. It was pitch black around me except for this window where they were looking at me. I felt this immense fear that I didn\u2019t want to die, that I wanted to go back. But it was too late. The ones looking at me were my family. Thats all I remember from that dream. It was scary more than anything. That fear has already left me. Somewhere inside of me I do want to die, that I do hope that happens so I can rest. Im reckless with my life. I don\u2019t have hope for my future. I can\u2019t envision it anymore. Tried to just live with life as it comes to me. I don\u2019t have much energy left in me anymore. I know im selfish. Ive always been alone and I\u2019ve always been okay with being alone. I know what people would give to be in my place and time. To have another life, another shot at things, but I\u2019ve given everything up. Im 21 and im just so tired. Getting high everyday is starting to take a toll on me, especially my memory but im okay with me it. Im slowly drowning and im okay with it.",

            "comment": "Stop getting high. It\u2019s hard but just don\u2019t. It\u2019s not necessary and it\u2019s not useful other than to mask pain. Why avoid pain? Like a runner or while working out. You need the pain to know where your limit is and then push further. That way next time you reach that wall you go through it easier and can get to the next wall. Getting high just makes you give up at the first wall. Just keep going and keep trying. You are doing a good job. Just love the little things and find out who you are. Keep progressing. There is no end goal in life. It\u2019s just about making the best of the weird little thing we call life. Love you \u2764\ufe0f",

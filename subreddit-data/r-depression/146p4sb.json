    "postText": "19F I'm not living life. \n\nTo summarize, it been 2 years now, high school is over. I failed certain class, I couldn't directly go to college. During that lonely process, I see everyone that I know progressing in life, while I remain stagnate. Due to depression and verbal abuse, I'm very slow to complete the class. I have no one I can talk to there since everyone is on their corner or way too old. I'm worried the next year I'll be isolated yet again. Last year I told myself I'll make it, but it ends up failing. The only thing that will change is the fact I'll enroll in a trade class and I may get my first minimum wage job after applying for almost 30 times.\n\n Even if I'm making small progress comparing to my peer, I feel completely behind in life. I was discouraged to get a job when i was 16-17 (by my parents,they were against it) . \n\nNow I'm completely broke, I have no saving yet.I assume all i be doing is working and working and nothing else. I'll be empty. I'm looking for guidance.My day consist when I'm outside to walk in the park, but the feeling of emptiness and loneliness is constantly present. I can go to the library and go outside to buy groceries, That's it.\n\nI have nowhere to go, each time it makes me feel more depressed, reminding myself how pathetic I am. I manage to quit social media for 1 year, when I went back barely no ''friends'' have reach out to me just to prove how unwanted I feel. I try to nurture my peace and be patient toward myself to avoid self harming myself.\n\nHere's my plan for the next 3 months.\n\nJUNE: HIATUS\n\n JULY: get my first minimum wage job + save money\n\nAUGUST: start my trade skill (1 year training) + get my high school diplomat (complete 1 exam) in adult education\n\nSEPTEMBER: join a social group, attend events for socialization, social hobbies ??\n\nOctober:\n\nI'm open for any recommendation, suggestion and tips. I'm looking for ways to do activities that don't take money away from you too much. After, my goals are to moved out of the house, so I can do everything I wanted to do. This is pretty much my hope.\n\nedit: forgot to mention my parents discourage me to get a job, i didn't know how to handle these things during that time my solution back then was to be a freelancer artist but i realize i couldn't make it.",

I don\u2019t grow up in a culture where living with family into adulthood is pressured onto children, but I know people who have and often it sets them back a few years (if they\u2019re living in the US, as the culture here doesn\u2019t really go alongside with the whole family oriented culture). If you do end up living with them, don\u2019t feel bad either! It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a leech or whatever. Teenager hood was boring for me too. I had friends but I knew in the back of my mind that I was not going to stay in my home town so I often distanced myself. You can always meet people, and at your age it\u2019s easier to make friends because everyone is in the same boat as you basically. You\u2019ve got this!",

To say the least I'm not rich and could afford the preview days or the freshman camp where your create friends and stuff. This really sucked. I was also came from a really abusive and traumatic time. in high school I was raped taken advantage of by the football team and bullied for it  which I  turn made me not be in a public school setting on top of COVID. I was working but due to harassment from those same people it has sucked because they have followed me. I was assualt freshman year and had issues after a forced abortion. Which nobody understood, because I could talk to my parents about it. My sister who I was living with partly was behind it. After being homeless struggling to keep a job because of PTSD and harassment I was homeless. While this happened I ended up in a shelter and some stole my phone locked, locked me out of my classes, and tried to steal 25000 not longer after I missed the date to get it fixed. I was working on a hypothesis I thought could cure cancer. I've already tried to kill myself five different time over the past year. I have no friends because they don't understand and I don't trust anyone. On top of find my rape videos on pornhub and having more video put out every day. I reported everything I could and the police didn't take me seriously. Im too broke to sue the person who made me fail out. I'm waking up after being raped and bruised everyday. Which caused me to to get credit card, but I was locked out .my credit is shit and failed out I can't get a job. I wont be able to qualify for any type of living accommodation now and my oldest brother was apart if this. As they were trying to force me into a trade school.i had plans and bifget and was financially good and safe until my brother thought he was in the right to bully and harass me. It cuased me to hang myself. After being kicked out of my father's house at 19. I got picked up by a pimp and was kidnapped and brutally raped. My memory isn't the best and i think I had kid in which I was forced to give up for adoption.",

There is no right or wrong path from here, just what works for you. As you age, you'll become more comfortable with the idea that there really isn't a correct path in life. Everyone may be getting married and having kids now, but maybe they're divorced and battling for custody in five years? Take it one day at a time. You have a pretty solid plan right now, just do your best to stick to it! You got this :)",

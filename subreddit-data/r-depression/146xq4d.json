    "postText": "43/M. Married with 2 kids. I should be happy. I have a great family and no major/serious stresses but I just don\u2019t care about anything anymore. \n\n2020 changed me. I don\u2019t know how or what did it. \n\nI use to love traveling. Weekend trips, day trips, week long trips. I was happy just going somewhere. That\u2019s gone. Zero desire to go anywhere. \n\nFor the first time in my career\u2026.I just don\u2019t care about anything. I just do the bare minimum and I\u2019m totally ok with it. \n\nBut my bigger issue is nights and weekends. I\u2019m bored out of my mind. But I don\u2019t want to do anything or go anywhere. I use to always be into something every weekend. Working around the house, learning something. Now, nothing sounds fun or worth getting up to do. \n\nDoc put me on a low dose of antidepressant but that hasn\u2019t really done much. Really just kept me from going deep into my depression.\n\nRight now it feels like I live for the weekend but I get to the weekend and I\u2019m bored and miserable. Endless loop.",

You could change something there , to make it more exciting .  \n\nYou could see what interests other people and try to go with them where they want to go , to make them happy .  \n\nYou could audition for the next season of Survivor on CBS Paramount TV and struggle to survive about a month , for a one million dollar prize for first place .  \n\nI think that any living on my own with limited money , no credit cards just cash let's say be homeless or etc for awhile is exciting .  \n\nDo you like wilderness / camping ?  \n\nAnything that threatens whether you stay alive or not can be exciting , and the safety net would be coming back to the way things currently are .",

Something pops out at you, something you know they would absolutely love.\n\nInstantly, you get so stoked about sharing it with them, right? Then reality sucker-punches you square in the gut. They're not around anymore, or they've moved on from your life, or worse - they've made it clear they don't want to hear a peep from you.\n\nMan, I'm lost trying to describe the feeling that hits me then. It's like a crap cocktail of loss, regret, and some straight-up sadness.\n\nJust had a run-in with it the other day. I was at the mall and saw this thing I knew my friend would flip over. My first instinct was to shoot them a pic. But, the kick is - they'd recently made a choice where they no longer want our friendship to be a part of their life anymore. The reason? Their new SO's got a tight leash on their social circle. It's absolutely a perfect case study on  toxic relationships 101, but hey, out of my hands, right?\n\nSo, do any of you guys go through this? How do you handle this gnawing feeling?",

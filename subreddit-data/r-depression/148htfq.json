    "postText": "You awake, and slowly become aware that you are freezing to death.\r\n\nYou are lying, motionless, in snow. Above you are snow-covered pines, clear air, and stars. You are very, very far from others. The cold is extreme.\r\n\nYou have a coat, but your hands and face have been exposed while you slept. You are aware of terrible pain, but it is some distance away, concealed by a pervasive numbness. Your breathing is terribly, terribly shallow. Fear of permanent damage to your body crosses your mind, but quite passively.\n\nIt seems, somehow, very much easier just to lie here in the snow, fingers slowly blackening, than it is to move any more. It is more than that: there is a deep feeling of indifference to anything you might gain by moving.\r\n\nIn some ways, you feel dead already - more like a piece of dead, rotted wood than a person.\n\nBut you *are alive*.\n\nJust over the hill, there is a small cabin. If you move, you will be able to reach it.\r\n\nSlowly, you make the decision to survive.\n\nYou stir, one muscle at a time. Everything is painful, everything difficult. You manage to turn yourself over, and, taking it very slowly, rise.\n\nYour walk is slow, hunched and shambling. You try to pull your hands inside your coat as you walk, but they hurt more and more. The night is dark, the air cruel. But everything, now, seems simpler. It was somehow in question before, but now you know you must survive. One foot in front of the other. You must survive.\n\nYou crest the hill, and the cabin comes into view, just a dark shape, barely illuminated by the moon.\n\nYou reach the door and prise it open. Inside, it is pitch black, cramped and drafty. One of the windows is broken and a slat is missing from the roof. But it does not matter; everything now has a clear necessity to it.\n\nFumbling in the dark, you find kindling, old newspaper, matches, and a few dry logs, always maintained here; in the corner, an old stove. Your hands are almost unresponsive, but you are able to open the hatch and set a fire.\n\nStriking a match is a problem. You cannot grip it, fumbling over and over between stiff, painful fingers. But you persist, over and over, because it is the only thing to do.\n\nAfter many attempts, you are able to trap the match against the edge of the doorframe with one hand and move the box against it with the other. Light springs out. You drop the precious match under a piece of newspaper, and it takes. Healthy flames rise, licking hungrily at the kindling above. You pull the door shut.\n\nA forgotten sensation flows over your body, and you are filled with relief. You huddle, gratefully, by the stove for many long minutes.\n\nA rough plastic sack hangs on a hook. Inside you find supplies - biscuits, bottled water, cans and dried foods. There are two jars of peanut butter. You don't feel hungry at all, just a hollow numbness, but you know you must eat. You must survive.\n\nYou manage to tear open a packet of biscuits. You are still shaking and clumsy; several fall out on the floor. But you take one in both hands, and lean down to take a tiny bite.\n\nSuddenly, you become aware how much you needed this, how grateful you are. You eat, slowly and carefully, nourishing yourself. The bottles of water are frozen, but you move one by the fire and it thaws. You sip a little.\n\nYour body is still in pain, but is slowly relaxing a little as its basic needs are met. There is a pile of blankets on a simple bed.\n\nYou must retain heat. You must survive. You reach up and push your coat into the hole in the ceiling, and hang a blanket, folded into two layers, over the window, pushing it into the gap in the broken pane. You put another log into the stove and tend it until you are sure that it has taken.\n\nYou gather the rest of the blankets around you and collapse on the bed. For a moment before you sleep, you notice just how wonderful it is simply to be warm and to have eaten, and that just this, for now, is truly enough.\n\n\\---\n\nThis is exactly what it's like for me. I don't know how it is for you, but for me, my freezing waste is my horrible room, when I haven't slept properly in weeks, and I'm off work, and there's old food going off on a plate on the floor that I don't have the will to move, and I'm worried about mould in my lungs, and I'm so hungry but I just can't face the simple task of getting up to get something to eat.\n\nYour going to get something healthy to eat, or stepping out of the door, or managing to work for a while, is just the same as struggling through the snow to that cabin. It's just as hard, and just as meaningful, and you deserve the warmth and nourishment you find just as much as any survivor pulling himself through a frozen waste. The metaphor is about having well-deserved compassion for your own position.\n\nMy own cabin, at the moment, is well kept and warm. I eat well and take care of my health and my appearance, and I go out to work. I like to imagine that this is taking a net and going out to catch some fish, when the supplies in the cabin get low - it is necessary: I must survive.\n\nWhen I face a reversal, like a screw up at work, or my bike breaks down, then I don't collapse, feeling totally inadequate, as I might have before. It's simple - there's a hole in my cabin letting cold air in; I am upstanding, a human, and I respond. I fix the problem as best I can, finding planks to hammer over the gap. If there are no planks or nails to hand, thick branches will do. I fix the problem and I survive.\n\nIf I face some embarrassment in front of friends or a painful rejection, it is less likely to tear through me. I note that the night is especially harsh, that my hands are stiffening; I return to my cabin, set the fire to warm myself, and make sure that I eat a meal and rest in shelter. I will survive.\n\nSometimes I have enough energy and I walk up a mountain to try to get a better view. I hope one day to see smoke rising from another cabin, and to meet a wife to keep me company. But if that never happens, being alone is OK; I can survive, and I must survive.\n\nI need know nothing about you, friend, to know that you deserve to be warm, fed, and safe inside your own cabin. I hope very much that you can find your way there.",

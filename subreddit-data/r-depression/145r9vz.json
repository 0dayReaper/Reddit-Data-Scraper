    "postText": "There's almost nothing to look forward to in my life right now. Just physical pain, mental pain, loneliness, vulnerability when it comes to competing in society and earning a living. I can't even date right now because I can't sit down due to pain. I've been cast aside, abandoned, given severe trauma to work through by the person I used to trust most. Normally I can look at the things I'm grateful for, but not today. \n\nAfter talking to the person who traumatized me I spent almost 24 hours having anxiety turning into a panic attack with no sleep and no one to see this weekend and my bladder hurts and I'm supposed to get a job but I can't even sit. How the fuck are you supposed to work with all this pain and I'm just rambling because it's so so fucking shitty and I have insomnia and I'm supposed to be sleeping and everything is a chore.  EVERYTHING is a chore. Everything is just to keep me moving through this stupid shit world and my parents are probably going to die soon and I'm so tired. \n\nI'll drag myself forward because I always do but fuck all of this so fucking much right now.\n\nAnd this isn't even as bad as it can get. I'm pretty fortunate in some ways. (Not in others) But I still feel like it's hell.\n\nI'm fucking angry about life and how so so many people come to this subreddit because life is being so fucking shitty to them and their brains are being shitty. None of us deserve this. What the actual fuck.\n\nAnd I'm not angry enough to get the energy to fix my problems. Just angry enough to suffer and not sleep. God fucking damn it fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck\n\n\nI have endured so much. I have been trying my absolute best for 5 years . And a decade before that I tried my goddamn best for years after the first trauma .I'm tired. Guess I'll have to get high to get through tomorrow.",

That's so true, and so hard.   \nI don't have answers for you, I came here seeking the same. I wish I had.  \nBut I really really hope it gets better for you, and can live the life that you deserve.",

Thanks for the hug and the well-wishing.\n\nUnfortunately when you have chronic illness, pain is a shitty reality of life and there's no taking it away entirely. When you're born with genetically shitty collagen, your body is literally not held together properly and so everything gets injured repeatedly. The only treatment is to exercise so that strong muscles hold your bones together. But you're also more likely to get injured when you exercise. It's a never-ending treadmill of exercise and recovery and pain. That's what I'm dealing with. I've had back spasms since I was 11. Currently my tailbone is just out of whack for no good reason and I can't sit. The PT told me it won't be a quick fix.\n\nYou also eventually develop central nervous system problems like migraine and bladder pain. \n\nIt's actually fairly well managed right now, ironically. Not being able to sit is really hampering my ability to work and socialize.",

I've gone through embracing and rejection of myself constantly, wondering why I can't be all the good things people said about me intelligent and creative without all the bad and just be normal but with the good things, or enough of the good things to come to wisdom before experiencing what would create the wisdom, knowing how to handle my emotions various ways aside from if I'm anxious excuse myself because I wouldn't always be allowed to do so, an example being how my parents despite me being afraid of causing children in a taikewando class harm, just forced me to keep going and dismissed my feelings as \"just control your strength\".",

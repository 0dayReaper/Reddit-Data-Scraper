I have an amazing husband who supports me with everything and anything, I didn\u2019t have a traumatic childhood or anything bad happen to me ever. I come from a warm and loving family. But I\u2019m depressed. I hate myself. Going through my day to day life is such a struggle. I have multiple friends who come from bad families and have had traumatic things done to them, they have a reason to be depressed. I don\u2019t. What\u2019s wrong with me that I can\u2019t be happy ?",

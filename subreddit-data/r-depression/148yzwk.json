    "postText": "some questions that kind of summarize my entire post:\n\n\\- if i'm not motivated to improve my mindset, does that mean nothing's actually wrong in my head? if something was wrong and i knew i was in control of at least some aspects, wouldn't i logically be wanting to take the right steps? if i genuinely do not want to improve myself, and coast through life for the next few decades until ive grown completely detached from everyone so i would be able to kill myself, is it just hopeless?\n\n\\- is it possible to have suicidal ideations without being depressed? i gravitate towards it because its self-indulgent and comforting, kind of utopian. i recognize my ideations (fantasies) are an idealized, fictional, and skewed view of suicide in actuality, and i would never consider even injuring myself in my current social environment.\n\n\\- is it possible to build an interest in something you do not have an interest in (i.e. forcing an interest)? and how do you power through the start, especially if you're doubting you'll ever gain interest? can the same be applied to building interest in other people?\n\n\\- how can i go about changing my beliefs? (about human psychology, origin of life and the universe, etc). i hold a lot of (irrational?) doubt and cynicism towards a lot of self-help advice i read. i know the brain is highly suggestible so i wish i was able to control myself by convincing myself of certain things, but i feel unconvinced. l\n\n\\- how do i talk about my problems and feelings (i.e. with a therapist, counsellor, psychiatrist, etc) if i don't know what they are? i do not trust words to describe what i feel so i am entirely lost in how i feel. most of the time i can't seem to distinguish \"happiness\" and \"sadness\"\n\n\\- (edit): is it normal to feel like you can not relate to anyone, even if they talk about similar things? i do not think i understand what anyone else is going through, either. but sometimes i search and can never find people who have a similar mentality as me. i know recognize saying \"no one understands me\" is clich\u00e9, ignorant, and perhaps self-absorbed, but i don't know what else to think. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni have never been diagnosed with depression or anxiety but i currently take prescribed antidepressants for my anxiety. i felt really good for the first six months after taking them, but the thrill of not having anxiety has passed and i regressed to a new kind of depressive state. i would not call myself depressed but i wouldn't be surprised with the diagnosis, and i also just don't know where else to post.\n\nthis new state entails a lot of general apathy. i am able to feel things in certain contexts, but for the most part i feel like a machine.\n\ni have nothing to think about except the same depressive thoughts and suicidal ideations ive been dwelling on for 5-6 years. i get annoyed by this, my thoughts are constantly focused on myself. it's extremely unproductive to think about myself so much. but for as long as i could remember, i never thought about my interests or other people without thinking about myself in relation to them. i am really tired of thinking about myself but i don't know how to think about anything else. or i am too bored to think about something else. i've grown so tired of myself but i am really all i have.\n\n* \\^could this be indicative of narcissistic personality disorder? regardless, how can this be counteracted?\n\ni don't really care about anyone except myself. as i type this i have a friend in the hospital who i am avoiding talking to and i wouldn't say i feel guilty, unless i don't know what guilt feels like for me on these meds.\n\ni really care about my family, though. if they did not exist i would really feel like i had no purpose in existing. sometimes it feels like everything i have ever done has been for them. but now i am at an age where moving out is setting in as a reality, and i am really not sure how disconnected i will feel after a decade of living by myself. right now i would never do anything to hurt them, which is why i am scared of potentially hurting them decades in the future.\n\ni am assuming i will live by myself because i have never felt a romantic attraction. this is the most alienating part for me. since i am constantly in my own head, i've never felt a genuine connection to anyone, including my closest friends. never having a romantic attraction makes me feel a lot less human and more disconnected from my peers. i know \"aromanticism\" exists as a sexuality but i am not strong enough to settle on that. i really hate thinking that i am just built like this and there is no hope for romance.\n\ni have had like five therapy sessions but nothing else. i feel like at least counselling would help me but right now i just couldn't be bothered. i might if it's this bad when university picks up again. the problem is it is extremely hard for me to articulate what's wrong, and i am always left feeling like i've got the wrong understanding of my feelings. i don't trust objective actions i take anymore either. every conversation i would have with a therapist would feel like wasted time. i would ramble for hours about something i genuinely do not believe or ever think about, giving the therapist the entirely wrong impression. and i know at the end of the day, no therapist or counsellor can fix my problems, they can only offer advice and suggestions that i know i would not follow.",

            "comment": "You ask too many questions and you make it more complicated you will never be able to do all of them at once, its way simpler than that just start simple step by step. First you gotta learn some stuff, read some books or listen to audiobooks about psychology and how to switch your habits around. They will teach you to control your mind the right way, then reprogram your mind and your whole mindset will change around and all things will fall in place trust me its possible, just trust your intuition and put some real effort otherwise it wont happen. \nTheres nothing wrong with you or your brain, just society nowadays makes it hard to live in a sane way, you gotta put extra work in to break those chains that has been put on you from birth.",

                    "comment": "also i have been told i ask too many questions and am overcomplicating things countless times, so i try to fix it, but always go back to making it more complicated. it doesn't really help me. all attempts to reprogram my mind have failed. i feel responsible for it, i feel like you're giving the best and only advice that exists but it just hasnt helped me at all. i genuinely do not know what intuition feels like. the fact i did have anxiety also means that something was wrong objectively wrong with my brain that has now been mended thanks to the medication, so it is not farfetched to believe something else could be wrong. but i do get paranoid that i brainwashed myself into believe theres something wrong with myself so i engage in self-destructive habits to comfort myself",

Whether its negative or positive. So it only makes sense why youve been feeling all of this. Im not tryna sound all spiritual or some sort of sage or some shit i was just at the same state as you were years back i felt the same exact way until i decided to switch it around years back. It all starts with the mind. Ive almost OD multiple times.\n\nIm just tryna help out and try to tel you exactly what i did to get you so i could atleast show you the right way to go, the rest is up to you!",

And the easiest and fastest way to understand.\n\nBut anyway you sound pretty smart, i would recommend a good book if you read any or maybe even listen to audiobooks, theres a book called reality transurfing its by vadim zeland a russain quantum physicist. The book is originally russian but it has been translated perfectly to english. \n\nGive it a try it could change your life. Its also a pretty fun read to get your mind away from all that negativity you know?",

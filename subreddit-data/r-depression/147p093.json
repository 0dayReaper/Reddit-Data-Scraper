Last year I messed around on tinder (I\u2019m female they are male, I gave oral sex and skin to skin only nothing penetrative) and after a few months I started reading online about herpes. I took the best test in the world and I was negative, yet every time I do something that makes me happy I start thinking, what if I actually do have it? And get depressed again. today I woke up with a panic attack because of nudes I sent last year which the guy swears he deleted but he blocked me now because of me removing him and some stuff between us went bad. I come from a conservative place and I don\u2019t know how to make myself feel better",

Write it down in a journal - which choices you make and for what reason.\n\nWhat you think makes you happy now, might not make you happy in the long run. It is like a choose-your-own-adventure game. It may be boring, but that's where you get lured off the path.\n\nTry to figure out what person is truly happy, beneath the facade and in the most adverse moments of life.",

                            "comment": "You don't - you learn from it and overcome it.\n\nIt's a death of the old you - the rebirth of the new.\n\nIn the case of the person who has got your nudes. You are now not the person who sends nudes. These pictures are not of you, they are pictures of flesh and a reflection of him and his actions. He should feel ashamed, and should he share it - that is illegal.\n\nYou're probably not feeling ashamed because of it, you're probably anxious because of the eventual consequence of it. Like the choose-your-own-adventure-game I talked about. Karma or whatever. But bad karma happens to good people for wrong actions as well...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou feel ashamed beneath it all, because you come from a conservative background, and left that path. But if that path was right for you, you would probably not have left it. Still there were probably things you learned there, to protect yourself from future hurt. \n\nShame is not an actual feeling. It is something that is placed upon us - a conditional love. So since we long for connection - we feel \"ashamed\" - but the true need or lack of feeling is connection - and in relation to that it is sorrow.\n\nTo remedy this, you can talk about this with your family, and if they forgive you - you'll feel connected, but then you're back where you started.\n\nYou can continue on your liberal path, and find connection there, but it won't really help with entangling your two sets of values.\n\nSo, you can choose your own experience, and learn from all this, and still feel connected. Because these are really individual feelings. You can still connect with certain aspects of conservative living, and certain of liberal.\n\nOf course conservatism or liberalism might not connect so much with you. But personally - I think it's better to connect to people regardless of tradition or ideologies. To me tradition speaks of values, and ideologies speaks of dreams or wishes, which reflects needs.\n\nYou want sex, so how should you go about it in a way that is safe for you in the long run?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only way to feel better about the self is to elevate the self. From \"sins\" to \"virtues\" - from being a slave to becoming a character. Where sin is in the mind, and with self-control you have self-respect. It doesn't take away desire. Lust is lustful thinking. Submitting to behavior and impressions which stimulate this way of thinking.\n\nThe moralistic aspect of conservatism creates a shadow, and you start feeling ashamed for natural feelings - because then you are not connected to the group in the back of your mind - but of course your parents probably had sex as well... \n\nWhereas the freedom aspect of liberalism mistakes lust for connection, but it ends in lust because that's where it started.\n\nIt is natural to feel hunger, but if you can't control it, you won't be truly gratified - and you won't be able to show appreciation. And you'll feel bad about yourself because you're a glutton, and you'll get feedback on it. You feel bad about yourself, so to escape that \"reality\" you eat more. \n\nBut it's all based on feeling connected and love, however you cannot really expect that from without - love is a feeling from within.\n\nWho loves you? Is it the stranger who shames you for overeating (father), or the friend that enables you (mother)?\n\nWhat would a kind father, and a kind mother do? Teach you, help you, accept you, love you, and remind you - probably...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have a bunch of feelings that are probably hindering you in experiencing it, that you should feel through. \n\nTo \"let go\" of feelings you need to feel them fully, and not do things to distract you from feeling them.\n\nAnd then of course not go back to old habits, that made you feel bad about yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are just my thoughts though based on my personal experience, and not a definitive answer, and I'm sure there are other aspects to take into account as well.",

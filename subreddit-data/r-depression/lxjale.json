    "postText": "Depression isn\u2019t just being depressed all the time. Anger and feeling numb is also a big part of it. Before I was diagnosed, I was a lot to handle. I would get angry for no reason and destroyed my things as an ineffective coping mechanism. I even went as far as assaulting my mom once but luckily, I have a mother who was nice enough to not press charges and encouraged me to go into therapy. I now know better ways to handle my anger. Of course most angry people arent depressed (some people are just miserable) but depressed people are often angry. Also I\u2019m not excusing my past actions I just did what I did and I can\u2019t take it back",

When i'm around people i know, i can sort of light up and put on that mask, and i make them all laugh and chat them up but really every day i go home i'm alone, depressed, or i get angry because i'm depressed, and it only makes things worse. It's a infinite loop of self destruction. That's why i smoke weed. I get home from work and hit a dab and it lifts me up. I still overthink though. Every little think can piss me off. My mind subconciously keeps track and adds each thing tha pisses me off together and it builds.  I can go from in a good mood, and then something small will happen, and i'll think about it more and more and it eventually just engulfs me in flames, and i feel livid. Lethal. I don't know why. The fact that i feel i have little control over it all only makes me more angry. Fortunately, my mood can also be lifted easily by the comfort of others or i let it go (within 15-30 mins usually).",

On the inside however, they would be experiencing the distressful symptoms of depression.\n\nDepression affects everyone differently and has a variety of symptoms, the most distinguished being deep, prolonged sadness. Other classic symptoms include:\n\nchanges in appetite, weight, and sleeping\nfatigue or lethargy\nfeelings of hopelessness, lack of self-esteem, and low self-worth\nloss of interest or pleasure in doing things that were once enjoyed\nSomeone with smiling depression may experience some or all of the above, but in public, these symptoms would be mostly \u2014 if not completely \u2014 absent. To someone looking from the outside, a person with smiling depression might look like:\n\nan active, high-functioning individual\nsomeone holding down a steady job, with a healthy family and social life\na person appearing to be cheerful, optimistic, and generally happy\nIf you\u2019re experiencing depression yet continue to smile and put on a fa\u00e7ade, you may feel:\n\nlike showing signs of depression would be a sign of weakness\nlike you would burden anyone by expressing your true feelings\nthat you don\u2019t have depression at all, because you\u2019re \u201cfine\u201d\nthat others have it worse, so what do you have to complain about?\nthat the world would be better off without you\nA typical depressive symptom is having incredibly low energy and finding it hard to even make it out of bed in the morning. In smiling depression, energy levels may not be affected (except when a person is alone).\n\nBecause of this, the risk of suicide may be higher. People with major depression sometimes feel suicidal but many don\u2019t have the energy to act on these thoughts. But someone with smiling depression might have the energy and motivation to follow through.",

It was a viscous cycle for  years. The only thing that helped me was meditating on the fact that most of the time anger is not anger its fear and sadness manifesting as anger...at least for me.\n\nA good way to look at it...is from the source below. \n\n\" Anger is often called a secondary emotion because we tend to resort to anger in order to protect ourselves from or cover up other vulnerable feelings. A primary feeling is what is what is felt immediately before we feel anger. We almost always feel something else first before we get angry.\n\nWe might first feel afraid, attacked, offended, disrespected, forced, trapped, or pressured. If any of these feelings are intense enough, we think of the emotion as anger.\n\nAs the drawing below illustrates, anger is like an iceberg in that only some of the emotions are visible. The other emotions exist \"below the water line\" where they are not immediately obvious to outside observers.\"\n\n  [https://creducation.net/resources/anger\\_management/anger\\_\\_a\\_secondary\\_emotion.html#:\\~:text=Anger%3A%20A%20Secondary%20Emotion&amp;text=Anger%20is%20often%20called%20a,immediately%20before%20we%20feel%20anger](https://creducation.net/resources/anger_management/anger__a_secondary_emotion.html#:~:text=Anger%3A%20A%20Secondary%20Emotion&amp;text=Anger%20is%20often%20called%20a,immediately%20before%20we%20feel%20anger).",

He said angry people get their frustrations out right away like those with road rage yelling at other cars or at a sports game yelling at other players. But they don't hold onto that anger because they just let it out and don't bottle it up. However some of us get angry at others and build resentment when we don't stick up for ourselves. Instead of setting boundaries and putting ourselves first, we worry about being polite and being liked.\n\nThe depression is anger turned inward because we take things out on ourselves instead of others. Instead of communicating our dissatisfaction with others, we keep it to ourselves and start to resent and put ourselves down.\n\nI think at some point though you reach a breaking point and snap so the anger goes from internal back to external expression. However I don't think all anger is anger that should be acted on obviously but I do think there is some truth to depression having some anger with ourselves.\n\nI'm just rambling at this point and I'm really tired, but I think that you brought up a great point about other symptoms of depression and anxiety not being addressed or acknowledged enough.",

            "comment": "Anger is definitely what exacerbates my depression the most.\n\nIt's been a slow burn over the last 10 years in getting to where I need to be...\n\n* I'm scornfully angry at several people who've abandoned me, stabbed me in the back, and slowed me down. People I thought I could trust, cause they were supposed to have my back in life.\n* I'm angry at myself for not avoiding these people &amp; situations when part of me could see those things coming.\n* I'm angry at myself for wasting so much time &amp; money for the path I'm on.\n* I'm jealous of the people closest to me in general. But I'm mostly jealous that they can't relate to any of this.\n* And now, with depression I get angry at myself for not being able to keep up with basic things. On top of all the rest.\n\nI know I shouldn't think about these things but they just weigh on me. The type of anger I feel just simmers and festers. It's not the explosive kind that people with anger issues typically have. I don't blow up and shout at the top of my lungs. To me that's just being upset. I've seen other people get upset, but I can never get myself to be upset like that. Anger for me just always seems to be in the background. It's like white noise. It just slowly erodes me. I have no healthy way of expressing it.",

I silently suffered with depression for years until something set me into a very deep depression to the point I was suicidal 24/7, attempted suicide and was hospitalized, and would cry for hours every day. At this point, I could no longer put my mask on and hide my major depression. After that deep depression, I felt anger like I've never felt before. I barely ever felt the emotion of anger in my life before that but it's like my depression shifted from feelings of sadness to feelings of anger. The two definitely go hand and hand.",

It takes away your ability to function like a normal human being, replacing every other feeling with either 'sad' or 'angry' or 'tired' to the point where simple existence becomes a challenge. It's why a lot of people who have depression also have anxiety and vice versa.",

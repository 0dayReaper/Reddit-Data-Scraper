    "postText": "I moved to a different country to study because back home is literally in shambles. Typical 3rd world problems (inflation, poor health care, the wages are shit etc). Now that I\u2019m here staying at my uncle\u2019s house cuz I\u2019m only allowed to get a part time job after 6 months entering the country. So to save some money I\u2019m staying at his home where he lives with his wife and 2 kids. \n\nAnd the wife treats me like a shit idk what did I do to deserve this. I was pretty depressed back home but it was getting better. Now I just feel like hanging myself from the ceiling. Like wtf am I doing with my life. Can anyone relate?",

Everybody shares the good stuff and ridicules the people who express their struggles for \u201cattention whoring.\u201d\n\nThe shitty thing is that people don\u2019t think twice about it being fake.  They have their own shit to worry about, so they just see the surface, take it as truth, and accept it.  Each person has their own image of you in their head, almost entirely based off very superficial shit.\n\nA lot of success in life is just looking like you have it together, even when you don\u2019t.  Dressing nicely, grooming yourself, staying fit by eating right and exercising\u2014if you\u2019re not a bumbling idiot, people will think you\u2019ve got the rest of it sorted out.

Also for what it is worth, I find it's best to cut out my social media browsing when I am having those thoughts.

Nothing makes me feel more worthless and depressed that getting told I suck 5 times a day. \n\nTo add to it, people I know, shitty ass people with a terrible work ethic, are out there getting new jobs left and right. It's all I see on my timeline. \n\nI'm trying so hard to keep it together. I have 2 kids and I hate not being able to just smile 24/7 and pretend it's all roses. Most days I struggle to get off the couch. Days that I manage to, I'm gone for maybe 3 hours, come home and lay right back down. \n\nI'm so tired if this bullshit. I want to enjoy my kids.

I keep myself up because of it, I wake up and the problems are still there. I distract myself with YouTube, videogames.. I gain 140 lbs. In a year and things just keep getting worse. I don't usually complain unless I've done everything I can, but... I haven't ended it yet because I don't want to hurt the people who still care.. But God do I want to, I'm just stuck.\n\nEdit (over two years later): Things are a lot better. Losing weight, single but not ready to mingle, paying bills, working, continuing to improve myself, etc. If I could do it, then so can you, don't give up hope. The bad times are only temporary, and overcoming your pain makes you stronger, and so does asking for help. Good luck guys \ud83d\ude0a",

You have to be persistent, and you'll gradually form good habits, and then the little things on your \"to do\" will become larger (e,,g apply for job, do an hour exercise every other day, etc). It's slow, and can be difficult but if you persist at small things, you'll be more consistent at taking control of your life, and feel better. You can lapse (I know I do!) but don't be discouraged.

    "postText": "I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. I lost my job almost a year ago now, and I've just been doing nothing. Staying at my dad's house, no desire to work again. It all feels like so much and I don't want it anymore.  I managed to do some things I thought would make me happy like making an album with my friend and now I'm in south America, hoping to find myself. I've been here a month and it feels no different than back home. Just pointless. No matter how much fun I manage to have or any feelings of happiness I get, its just a matter of time before I start hating myself again. I've tried talking to people but it always feels like nobody cares at all. I'm lost and tired and I don't know how much longer I can really keep this up. I just really don't know what to do anymore",

And how can you alleviate this self-hatred?\n\nWe care about you, for the little its worth. \n\nI would say stop trying to keep it up and take some time to really and truly rest and relax (outside of doing what the bare minimum to survive).",

I sometimes react to adversities poorly and I hate myself for that. I hate myself when I procrastinate. I hate that I feel like such a loser all the time and can never feel like im truly connecting with people. I even hate myself for coming on here and complaining because I know none of it should be a big deal. And I know I have plenty to be grateful for but hate it all. I hate where I am in life, even though I have a good career, family, and friends. And I try to take time to relax and rest but it just makes me hate myself for wasting time, doing nothing but trying not to feel sorry for myself. In the end I'm the only one who can make things better for myself, but I feel like I've been trying for so long that it's a lost cause. I've started to think that this is just the way I am, and I hate myself for that too.",

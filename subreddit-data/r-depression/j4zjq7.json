Everyone, take it from me, I am in the worst situation with my teeth because of this. \n\nI have over 20 cavities that will need to be taken care of like root canals, had two back molars pulled and have a half tooth waiting to be taken care of. I\u2019ve been told I will be in dentures if I don\u2019t get implants ASAP. I don\u2019t have the money. I\u2019m so scared I\u2019ll be toothless and I know that I\u2019ll never pull out of my depression that way. \n\nNow I have this added on top of my depression and it brings me panic attacks daily.

Even if it seems like nobody admits to it, I think it's pretty common in persons struggling a lot with their mental health, and it's not about laziness (heck I even enjoy taking long showers), I think it's about externalising how shitty and worthless you feel inside.\nNowadays since I don't have classes or a job, I shower/wash my hair once a week or before I have some kind of appointment. Barely brush my teeth and skincare only when my face feels \"crusty\"\ud83e\udd2e\nAnd let's not talk about the diet. That's another whole pile of shit.",

I\u2019ve been trying to eat better, sleep better, and get more exercise and while it has barely made a difference, It has sort of helped fight back the melt downs that I have sometimes. Just start with one thing and slowly implement it into your life. Start by trying to eat better. Save the junk food for a snack or after dinner. After you\u2019ve done that for a while, try walking. Diets, walks and exercise won\u2019t cure you, but it\u2019s a start. For me this stuff has only made a smidge of a difference, but if it increases the chances of not having a melt down, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m going to definitely have to go on medication later though. I still have my days where I don\u2019t feel like taking a shower and I really identify with the brushing thing. Sometimes you just have to force yourself up even if you have no motivation. Just try not to be too hard on yourself.",

    "postText": "So, it's happening again. I have been battling with depression on and off for about 6 years now and have been medicated for 3. Well, it's coming back again and ruining me. I am about to graduate university and I missed the photo shoot with everyone at campus because I kept telling myself nobody wants me there and everyone just tolerates me, not actually like me.\n\nI don't have close friends in university just people I know and talk to when I see them. I have social anxiety and couple that with the pandemic and depression you get one squirmy little awkward troll that nobody wants to be friends with. \n\nNow, the graduation party is coming up and I want to be able to celebrate so badly, I want to go dance and be happy. But if I go I will be alone, dancing and sitting alone, maybe some people will call me over but out of pity not because they like me. I would rather not go than to be pitied.\n\n I fucking hate myself, why can't I just be normal like everyone else? Why do I have to live with this part of myself that's always keeping me back and eating me from the outside? Why me?I am medicated so there is nothing else left for me to fix myself with. This pattern has followed me since my teenage years and I think it's staying, it's glued into me.\nDepression won again, I want to rip it out of me. I want to be free for once and let go. I literally feel like gollum.\nAnyway, I just needed to went. Thanks for reading.",

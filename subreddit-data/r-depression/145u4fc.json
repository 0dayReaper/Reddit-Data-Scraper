    "postText": "i've been struggling with MDD for years and was always high functioning until about 2 years ago i just stopped. i fluked college and this semester finally got myself onto their disability register so i could get my shit together. But i'm still failing and pretending to my friends and family and my boyfriend that i'm doing totally fine at school.\n\nI've been going to therapy secretly but it takes so much energy to even improve my mood and get out of bed. Even eating is a chore. It's so damn debilitating because i want to be what everyone thinks i am and i want to go and get internships like everyone else but i've done this all to myself and how long am i going to just give myself 'it's the depression' excuse. People are starting to graduate.\n\nI know i just have to get out of bed and just work and grind, that's the only way anything will get better. It just feels like i'm constantly  taking one step forward and one hundred back. I don't even know what to do with myself.",

I'm sure it has been tough for you to juggle.\n\nDon't beat yourself up, depression is not something we place upon ourselves but rather a battle we face daily. How is your support system?\n\nWhat is therapy going? If you find there to be too many tasks that you have to do, maybe braking them down to small chucks might help. As well maybe schedule tasks so that you are not doing everything at once.\n\nLife is a journey, sometimes we mover forward, Sometimes we stay where we are and sometimes we may backtrack.\n\nWishing you all the best, take care.",

Try to talk to online ones and they say they cannot talk to me. I really need someone to talk to. I\u2019m so fucking alone. I have nothing I\u2019m living in my car yet working 18 hour shifts.",

Now I\u2019m living in my car with my dog to use that money to build businesses. And leave. Idk what I did to deserve this. I\u2019m pretty sure I must have been an evil person in my past life and this is the hell I\u2019ve been given.",

I\u2019ve reached out to people who I\u2019d known for years and they don\u2019t care. They ignore me. Others just talk over me or dismiss me. So, I come to Reddit. And my situation is so complex that I quick chat doesn\u2019t really do anything. At this point I need a counselor. Probably actually a psychiatrist as I strongly suspect I have did. But, where I\u2019m at that\u2019s impossible. What you are offering is a start. And I am interested.",

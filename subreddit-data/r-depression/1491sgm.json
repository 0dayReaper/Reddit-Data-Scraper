    "postText": "I'm turning 24 in three days. I have no real friends. Whenever I try to make new friends they don't even bother with me. If I don't organise everything I could literally go missing and they wouldn't notice. I guess I have no personality but that's only because people forgot about me and I missed out on so many experiences.\n\nNo real career. I have dreams but time is going so fast I don't think I'll ever be anything and I was just kind of coasting through life because nobody ever gave me any real advice. I mean what the fuck. I have to figure this out on my own. I don't even have friends to turn to, to ask for help or advice. Literally what the fuck am I supposed to do. I hate this shit. The first like 16 years of life seem so great, even when they're actually shit and you're just in denial, then it just goes downhill from there.\n\nI don't really know how to approach people because I've struggled with social anxiety for the past 10 years, and talking to people doesn't really come to me naturally. I do try when the situation arises but it never feels quite right to me.\n\nMy mental health has been deteriorating since covid hit and I really just hate the fucking world now. I used to be so hard on myself and then I finally got out into the real world and I feel so bitter towards other people now. It feels like everybody just let me die. I don't know what was so heinous about me that I deserved to be left alone for years on end with nobody to talk to.\n\nThe older I get the more I realise that we all have the same problems, so why the fuck is everybody so superficial and quick to judge? These fucking people don't even know me, yet they know they want nothing to do with me off of one interaction or just by looking at me. First impressions are the absolute worst way to judge someone's character because they're either extremely awkward or people are presenting a false image of themselves to impress others when really everybody is just a fucking slug.\n\nMaybe I'm fuck ugly. I never thought I was very attractive and I'm certainly not tall but maybe I am just a fucking hideous beast of a man.\n\nI never had fun in my teens. My early 20s were a write-off because I was a shut-in and couldn't find work because I studied a useless degree.\n\nI'm only just starting to figure out who I am and what I want to do in life but I think it's over. The whole world is such a cold fucking place.\n\nI'm seriously considering suicide. I've had suicidal thoughts since I turned 18 but I thought it was just a passing phase and I'd grow out of it but it doesn't work like that.\n\nLife just keeps demanding more and more out of me and I never know what to do. I'm wasting my time and I don't even enjoy life. Why would I bother sticking around if I hate every second of it? It all seems so pointless. If only I had just a little bit of someone's time or a little bit of love. I don't even feel real anymore. I don't recognise this world. It's so hollow and insane.\n\nI used to be so optimistic and happy, but now I realise I was just delusional. The world has made me miserable just like everyone else. That's why I hate people so much. I had to put up with all their bullshit over the years and act as a fucking doormat for them, and now I'm just like them. They ripped away any enjoyment of life that I had left.\n\nI just want to be loved like everybody else but nobody can see that. They don't see me as a human being. They keep me around when I'm useful and then they toss me aside as though I never mattered to them at all.\n\nEvery good memory I have from my past is tarnished by the thought that I never really mattered to these people in the first place.\n\nI've always been different, but in an age where differences are supposedly celebrated and there's no stigma around mental health, it's just a fucking lie. Nobody cares about me and I cannot relate to anyone. Half the fucking time I'm not even present, I exist in my own head and I can't escape it.\n\nEveryone my age or even younger has so much more life experience than me, how can I possibly find where I belong if I can't even speak to these people because they might as well be speaking another language.\n\nOf course I'm not trying to absolve my own guilt. It feels like everything I did in the past 10 years was a mistake, and I regret it all. I had no idea the huge ripple effect it would have on my life, but how the fuck was I supposed to know when nobody tells you anything? Adults are fucking shitheads. Like maybe give us a heads up or something, but no, they annoy the fuck out of you when you don't want them around and then they never give you any actual useful advice that might save you in the future. Or they destroy your dreams by forcing you to work some lame 9-5 for the rest of your life. Fuck this shit.\n\nLife is shit. People are awful.\n\nI'm going to kill myself soon.\n\nBye.",

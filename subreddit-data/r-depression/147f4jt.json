    "postText": "I'm lying awake in bed and am feeling pretty fucking dark.\n\nI've jumped through almost all the hoops; I have a six-figure job, a master's degree in STEM, a wife, and a house, and I live in the city of my dreams... But I'm still struggling. I can barely make headway, I look at my retirement accounts, and they seem to be moving up slower than my loan's interest. With student debt pauments restarting, the situation will likely become even more dire. I don't know what the fuck im going to do, especially if I ever want to raise a kid.\n\nThen outside of my personal bubble, the world is utterly fucked. Climate crisis, war, growing wealth divide, crumbling infrastructure, massive legal corruption, the two-party system, religious fascism, white supremacy, a looming recession, I could keep going on, for the sake of this post - the world sucks right now.\n\nHow do you deciper if you are depressed and in need of medication or therapy vs. just aware of the world around you? I don't logically understand how someone can look at this shitty world and be able to go about life chipper and happy. Are people completely oblivious to the state of things or is there something wrong with me?",

Medication (Lexapro) helped put a band aid on the anxiety so I could wake up not panicking every day. Of course I can't afford it anymore so now I'm struggling again. I try to mitigate this by avoiding the news like the PLAGUE. Regrettably I'm in fucking Florida so that's next to impossible tbh. \n\nBetween getting fucked by rent and about student loan payments I swear to God it seems pointless. Anyway. I'm sorry you're going through this but you are far from alone. All the discord happening across the world seems to be inflicting a LOT of mental damage on especially young people. I just try to realize a lot of it is out of my control at this point and focus on my dog.",

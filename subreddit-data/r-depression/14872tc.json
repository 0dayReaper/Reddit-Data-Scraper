    "postText": "I don\u2019t know why but I feel as if there is something wrong with me. I\u2019m in college and in my final quarter I have decided to room with my friend and made some acquaintances and managed to form some small talk but that\u2019s just it i\u2019m bad at conversations and will never engage in one. I tell myself to try and sometimes I do but often times it feels as if I\u2019m the only one putting effort. The other thing too is that whenever I wanna hangout I stop myself because I remember how my other friends have people they always hangout with, meaning they have plans set up which isn\u2019t their fault but it just de incentivizes me to not try again because it\u2019s not worth it. And even when it comes to my friends they always have their own little groups of people to hangout with and sometimes I do get invited to group settings but I hate it because of how large and how my social anxiety gets the best of me. I\u2019m always creating these challenges in my head and just become a prisoner of my own mind. I hate that I can\u2019t change my thinking, I always try to minimize my fears of social anxiety but I\u2019m always brought back to the same position I was originally in. Sometimes I feel that if I didn\u2019t exist people would be able to continue on living as if my presence had no impact. What\u2019s worse is that I\u2019ve had these thoughts bottled up for a really long time and I\u2019ve continued to exacerbate this problem of mine. I keep thinking and hoping that maybe my life will improve but so far it feels like a distant goal.",

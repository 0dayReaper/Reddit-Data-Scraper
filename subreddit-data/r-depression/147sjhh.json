    "postText": "Monday through Friday, and a good portion of my weekends, I just lay here. I don\u2019t have the motivation to do anything else. It\u2019s pointless. I don\u2019t feel satisfaction from anything. I\u2019ve been doing ketamine therapy to try and help, and it does in spurts, but I\u2019m so exhausted all the time. I wish I could give my life to somebody who would appreciate it. I don\u2019t have friends, I don\u2019t have any family, and my fianc\u00e9 wants to die, too. We leave the house and do things sometimes, but usually it\u2019s just laying here. Watching TV, playing video games, but it\u2019s just passing time until we can sleep again. \n\nMy life has been on a steady decline for several years, and I thought it\u2019d get better once I left my abusive family but it doesn\u2019t. I love my fianc\u00e9 dearly, but what the fuck even is the point? I don\u2019t get happy from things we do really, or at least I have blinders on where I can\u2019t remember being happy. The only thing that keeps me alive is having six parrots to take care of, but I know I\u2019m failing them, too. I don\u2019t clean up like I used to, I don\u2019t cook for them like I used to, I can\u2019t bring myself to play with them as much. \n\nI use adderall three times a day to get the energy to work from my bed \u2014 propped up against pillows, listening to television, pretending I\u2019m somewhere else. I take benzos to put me to sleep when they\u2019ve worn off. I just don\u2019t understand the appeal. I have been fucked over by so many people, so many groups of friends, and now the world is even shittier since then. \n\nI like going to my ketamine infusions, but I\u2019m on boosters, so I don\u2019t go as often. The people are nice and care about me, but I know they\u2019re paid to. This last time I got intense panic and anxiety, so maybe that won\u2019t even help anymore. Plus, my psych is out of state and they lifted Covid exceptions, so now I have to find someone else. I\u2019ll probably be taken off of the crutches I have. \n\nJust wanted to rant. Thanks, guys.",

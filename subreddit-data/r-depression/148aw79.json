    "postText": "I\u2019m a medical student applying for residency in the US this year. I was sexually assaulted 2 years ago and I have been having a lot of trouble coping with triggers. Had my first appointment with a psychiatrist today and she prescribed me an SSRI and a benzodiazepine for a week. I have symptoms of both anxiety and depression, so benzo should help with possible increase in anxiety symptoms because of the SSRI. My parents are very against me taking medication, and they\u2019re pressuring me to take a break from my studies. I have worked very hard for years, and if I take a break now then all my hard work will go to waste. \n\nThis is my first time starting meds and I\u2019m scared of how they\u2019ll effect me. I have a very important exam coming up next month and I really don\u2019t want my performance to be affected. Anything I should know before I begin on this journey?",

            "comment": "It'd be wise to have a medication diary including when you start certain medications, at what dosages and any side effects. Take all medication as prescribed by your doctor.\nThe Benzo will work relatively quickly but the SSRI will take anywhere between 4-8 weeks for full effects. \nI did not experience it but some say that upon first starting these medication there can be increased of suicidal thoughts.\nMedication works differently for everyone but I wish you well on your journey. Take care.",

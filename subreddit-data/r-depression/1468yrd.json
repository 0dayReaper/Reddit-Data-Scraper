    "postText": "Hi everyone, I hope this post doesn't sound too dramatical but I really need to talk about all what's going on in my life to someone. First of all, allow me to introduce myself, my name is Luca, I am a 24 years old Italian guy, living in Austria.   \nBasically I have to say that I am already living a period of my life which would feel quite stressful by itself, indeed this is some background:   \n\\- I am having some health problems since more than one year (physical health, which oc has an important impact on mental health as well, trying to find a solution btw, but not easy)  \n\\- I am currently finishing writing my MSc thesis in order to graduate and at the same time working as an intern for a startup here, however, I know there is a very good chance that the company will not keep me after September and therefore I will need to look for a job elsewhere (and probably, not even in this country since I don't know german and this makes it more difficult to get a very good job as a foreigner)  \n\\- I am honestly quite alone here (in Vienna) since I lost few friends recently (we had some disagreements) while also I don't have many friends in general since I lived in 3 different countries in the last 2 years and therefore I always had this feeling of \"I don't want to invest much in new friendships or relationships since I know I will not be in country X in few months\". Moreover, in general I think for me it's difficult to keep friends long term, as I am constantly changing. The only people that I consider really really friends at the moment is two friends who I know from my Bachelor and I really consider my brothers, but unfortunately they live in different countries than me at the moment.  \nRecently, I got to know through Tinder (I know, it's a really fucked up place) a girl for whom I got addicted super easily. Indeed, we had two dates this week, we kissed and said a lot of sweet stuff to each other, like super sweet and she wanted already me to know her sister for example. However, I think I may have overseen some red flags with her, as she basically has a very bad past because of family traumas and also she has this habit of disappearing through messages for 24 hrs or more, because she says that she get so depressed to be unable to chat with me or do anything. Even more difficult, now it's more than 48 hours that she doesn't reply to my messages or calls, she just said yestersay \"ehi Luca, i am stressed, will write you later\" and then never came back.  \nThis whole experience of getting addicted to this / being treated badly made me understand that I would like to change in life, indeed, I have some goals (improving my knowledge of foreign languages, losing some weight and more important, start loving myself again). Any suggestion or advice for any of these things? Any other goal you would suggest me? I know I may be young to create so many problems but at the same time I am suffering a lot and feeling old inside.  \nThank you everybody in advice.",

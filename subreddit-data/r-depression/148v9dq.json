    "postText": "Starting at about age 5, I'd get this sensation that would start in my head, and move down to my toes over a ~10 second period. It was almost a tingling/sinking feeling, but that doesn't quite capture it. It's incredibly hard to explain the exact sensation. \n\nI could be laughing, joking, playing etc, and then I'd suddenly feel it. Once it reached my abdomen, a sudden and severe depression would overtake me. The physical sensation always preceded the sudden depression, so as a young kid I thought that it was the sensation making me sad. It happened throughout my childhood and into my late teens. It was incredibly random with no known triggers and it was such a sudden and massive mood shift it felt like I'd transformed into a different person. \n\nI'm 31 now, haven't experienced it in over 10 years, but still deal with severe depression/mood swings daily. But I've always been very curious about this sensation and if anyone else has ever experienced anything similar?",

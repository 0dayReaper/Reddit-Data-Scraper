I was at Oxford and then I spent many years in investment banking. This should demonstrate that I was somewhat hard-working and ambitious. But I was just following the path that was expected for me. If I'm told to do something, I can do it well.\n\nIt's when I'm left to my own devices that I struggle.\n\nI left my job about a year ago, with lots of savings, because I was fed up of it. I'm trying to work out what to do next. And I have no idea how to handle the freedom of being an adult.\n\nI was raised in a similar way to you. My parents were very loving and were trying their best, and they are in large part responsible for my success via academic hothousing, but they did do everything for me. I don't think I ever developed a real sense of personal discipline. I never did a chore in my life before I left for university, for example!\n\nIt would shock my friends and peers if they knew how much I still struggle with the basics of living, even in my thirties. I have never managed to pull together a basic budgeting, exercise or diet routine. I cannot bring myself to focus on literally any hobby. Only my best friend and partner can see how frighteningly infantile I am in these areas. \n\nIt's bizarre - because I was capable of feats of great complexity and endurance at work, and then on the weekends I'd fall apart - with less maturity than your average seven-year-old.\n\nI think the most important task of the parent is to make your child feel loved and secure, which my parents did very well. But the second most important task is to make them sufficiently independent. They tried but I think I was so weak I needed even more of a push!",

Being a helicopter parent was kind of expected of you in social circles and if you went watching over your kids 24/7 you were considered a bad parent. I think a lot of boomers grew up kind of independent. They had tons of chores to do, and spent their days outside with friends exploring the world figuring out who they were. Those boomers grew up, but maybe felt neglected by how they were raised and told themselves \"I'm not putting my kid through that\". What they didn't realize was that time spent independently exploring taught them valuable life lessons. Kids today don't get to do that. They're constantly on a digital leash. They don't get to learn from their mistakes and parents are more concerned with being their child friend then their mentor. I think being a good parent is like being a good manager. Your job isn't to jump in at every turn and do the work of those you lead. You show them the path and teach them how to walk it. That's the only way they grow",

My best friend is dealing with depression too, so we at least get to be miserable together. I couldn't be any more thankful for her. Anyway, we were talking not too long ago about how we never imagined life after high school turning out like this for us and if we knew what we knew now, we'd go back to high school. Even though we *hated* HS at the time, it was better than living life unmotivated, lost, depressed, fearful etc. \n\n&gt;One of my biggest things is that I feel overwhelmed by life, not knowing what career to take, how to organize my life in terms of paying bills, etc, it sucks,\n\nYup, this is one of my main problems as well. I've never felt more lost and overwhelmed in my entire life. I have no idea what path to go on career wise and I'm afraid I'll be stuck as a cashier forever. I long for a break from life (permanent one would be nice too honestly) but with me having to pay rent, it's just not an option. The world doesn't stop for anybody, it doesn't even slow down. I'm just so fucking tired, mentally and physically. \n\nI also grew up with my mom taking care of everything. I didn't have any chores as a kid, wasn't pushed to get really good grades etc. so I never really learned responsibility growing up. I've been sheltered my whole life and I don't feel like an adult, I don't even want to be one. I'm just not meant for the world. I'm too weak.",

Try to distract yourself by thinking about what you do have to appreciate in your life at this time and accept that we can't go back. We can control the future but need to reboot/re-learn what depression and anxiety took from us. Planning an activity that takes you out of your comfort zone can be quite rewarding, after the fact, and you never know...could lead to meeting new people. Seeking help and confiding in those you can trust are steps in the right direction. It takes time to repair many years of negative thoughts and behaviors. Stay strong man!

Another week of side effects but by the third week I started to feel some clarity and less noise in my head. Logical thoughts flowed better. Aside from insomnia and lack of motivation now, I'm feeling hopeful and know I made the right choice to get professional help. Way less dark thoughts...\nPlease don't let other's opinions or worrying about what people will say stop you from getting help. Know the you're not the only one struggling. Some of us have a hard time managing the beast in our heads and have forgotten how to cope or learned bad coping skills. Never surrender!\nThe meds are just the start for me but I feel they have put me in a position to move forward and to learn how to hopefully experience joy be happy again. Learning self awareness skills are essential to be able to live in the moment. Thats big. Work in progress...  Hope this helps.

I have a codependent relationship with my dad, so he lived to do everything for me and I was way too happy to let him. I still do, albeit much less so, since I live alone now. His dad was a hardass who didn't want him seeing his friends or going to college. He didn't have a relationship until he was almost 40 when he met my mom. So my dad was all about forcing me to make friends and find a girlfriend and do whatever else. Out of love. And desperation for me to not turn out like him and for him not to be his dad. \n\nAnd I know, everyone's saying, \"I'm not saying it's their fault... but it's their fault.\" As long as we're clear it was a team effort. Especially as we got older. My friends were independent. I didn't change.\n\nI couldn't even read all the comments, but every single one of them, as far as I got, was a \"second\" to the first comment blaming the parents. I will never have kids because I know I shouldn't be a parent. That's me both owning my part in my upbringing and my would be part in the raising of my child.\n\nBut most importantly, blame is not the point. Life sucks. Any number of things happened in my life and I reacted as I always did no matter how unbelievable the events in my life became. Okay, life sucks and I suck. That's who I'll blame. Perfect.",

I was saying to myself when I was out trying to socialize and to get my life together that I better be home, sweet home, in my sofa, watching endless tv shows episodes, switching back and forth between SFW and NSFW to philosophical existential to nihilism. \n\nNot doing anything at all will not solve anything in your  life it will make it worse, because when you're alone without any real matter keeping your mind busy, negative thoughts rule your reality.\n\nThe bottom line here, and it's the most important thing that took me out of my misery, is the survival mode. What I mean by that doing poorly is better than doing nothing. For instance, finding a not very good job is far better than staying home waiting for someone to pay your bills. \n\nOnce you pass the first phase of transition from worth shit to worth something not very big by focusing on one thing that really matters in your life, you can start making little improvements.\n\nI am not saying that it's that easy, and life isn't the same for everyone one, but we can try to do our best. Maybe our best is not the best ever made, but it's enough for us to make our life a little bit less painful and a little bit more peaceful.\n\nWish you the best. I send you my love and kisses. Stay strong.",

I could have followed my dreams, had the balls to go against the grain and express my passion. Instead I live inside a bubble. This is a bubble where caring about what others think of you compresses your decision making and molds it around societal norms. When I was younger I didn\u2019t receive the positive reassurance needed in order to grow. I\u2019m in a constant struggle between what I think others want me to do versus what I should do. My habit of comparison is an outcry for reassurance in whatever I\u2019m doing; so much so that it takes time and focus away from an objective that would be more lucrative.",

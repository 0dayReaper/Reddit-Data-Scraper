So I changed my major to something incredibly easy. Got my Bachelors and I absolutely couldn\u2019t give a shit about it. I will never use my degree for a job. I regret even going to college and wasting 5 years of my life on that. I\u2019m sure my parents can\u2019t stand that I\u2019m not making a name for myself and making them look better. I\u2019m sure they can\u2019t stand all the mental health issues I face on a daily basis which is somewhat attributed to them. They see me as perfect or that I need to be perfect. At least that\u2019s how I view myself in their eyes. My biggest regret is going to college and wasting their money. They\u2019ve never said anything about it but I feel like it\u2019s an issue. My biggest word of advice is to stop giving a shit about what they think and live for yourself. You can still love them, be a good son/daughter, and at the same time not give a shit about what they think of you. Remember it\u2019s your life, not theirs. Therapy also helps some people.",

Felt useless. \nI was open with my professors about it and they gave me some grace and allowed me to take a break and make up work the following semester, which I was immensely grateful for. I strongly believe going to art school made me lose my creativity, and I also strongly regret going to college to begin with. I think it stole years from me. But we are so drowned in the idea that we *have* to go to college, we don\u2019t even *know* there\u2019s another choice. I did what I thought I had to. And my traditional parents wouldn\u2019t let me have it any other way. Bad enough I didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer or doctor\u2014 I had to go to college for *something*.\n\nBut I also met a friend in college who brought out of me a piece of my soul that set me free and brought me some short-lived happiness for once in my life for a couple years before I developed a chronic illness. So I am grateful for that\u2014 and if I hadn\u2019t gone to college and met her, I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t have experienced many amazing things and had so many fun times for those couple years. Even when I was depressed, once my schoolwork was done and I could breathe, she was always there to prop me back up. I don\u2019t think she ever understood the brevity of the mental turmoil I was in, but maybe I needed that sort of cluelessness and aloofness and innocence in a friend to help me live a little and give me some happy times even in my sadness. \n\nI\u2019ve been so depressed all my life since I was 11. I wish I could catch a break but it\u2019s like I\u2019m doomed to be mentally fucked up. 2 years of happiness at 21-22 was all I got, and then I get hit with this illness that puts me back at square one and now mere functioning is just exhausting. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re suffering so much. College is portrayed as this fun-loving time of self-discovery\u2014 let\u2019s party and get a degree!! It\u2019s just not *like that* fit everyone\u2014 and it\u2019s not because we\u2019re lazy or ungrateful for an education. \n\nWas college something you were initially excited for?",

Fast forward 3 years and I graduated with barely a 2:1 and was already in the middle of a full onset depressive breakdown. It took me nearly 3 years to make any sort of productive recovery, and I spent probably the next 5 years piecing myself together to work out who I really was and what I really wanted from life.\n\nThe truth is alot of us to to study with a real lack of perspective or idea of why we are going there - society has burdened us with the notion that going to uni will put us on the right track, but I've come to realise that uni really should be a place for maturer people to go and realise a passion/interest that has been shaped by experience and a really concretised direction...I think most young adults are completely unready for the demands of a largely independent, research-led discipline.\n\nDon't be so hard on yourself, take stock of what you are good at and what you are interested in. If you're just starting at university and you think it's a waste of time, drop out and spend your time working out what it is you really want to do - get out of the academic bubble and do some work, meet more people who aren't just getting fucked up at student bars and club nights. If you're just finishing university, then consolidate the experiences you had and use it to teach yourself to be a better person. No experience should be in vain, instead learn from it. There are so many of us who have trodden a similar path, but there is so much scope for a better life away from that time. Yes alot of people recount their uni years as the greatest time of their life, but there is so much that is sooooo much better than 'the uni years'.\n\nStay strong, I hope this helps.",

I wasn't good enough at math to study computer science/engineering at tech and big name universities, which I dreamed of. I don't want to do accounting for a living and bureaucracy won't let me change it to finance at least\u2026 even if I barely pass it, I'd like to get a better and broader degree to put on my CV (resume) as I'll likely not work in either field, but I would tolerate some sort of analyst role if I actually manage to master Excel to do it.\n\nI'm actually thinking of dropping out, eventually transferring or switching to an easier uni if possible next year or something for finance/econ just to complete it and put it on my CV. In the meantime, I'm thinking of pursuing coding courses, courses in digital marketing and eventually Cisco academy courses with the hopes that at least one of them works out. I don't really want to be a paper pusher. I'd like to have a good job that is fulfilling and doesn't make me want to kill myself.\n\nI work as a translator and I enjoy it. I don't dread Mondays or the next day. The pay is not amazing, just about average, but it's a lot better than all the other boring and/or stressful menial jobs for the same or even higher pay, but it's a dying field due to AI and automation. I also pay for everything myself as education here is affordable for your first degree, so no debt here at least.\n\nI try to be positive and all that, but I screwed up again. I dropped a program once already 4 years ago when my parents were trying to support me but it was difficult financially. I haven't completed a degree yet but it seems like I already have a master's in depression... What makes it even worse is that I used to be a good student at school, I used to get decent and even excellent grades (even in maths, but with lots of effort, unfortunately), but had no idea what to do in life. Frankly, I still am kind of lost, but at least I know what I would prefer to do if I have the capacity for it. The school capsule was slowly but gradually cultivating depression for me and the great expectations lead to great nothing.",

But i gotta say if you dont like your current program then change to finance/econ and you can get the credits and continue from there, you wont lose that much because these degrees are very similar(check their syllabus and ask if they give you the credits), \nI relate so much to you tbh you are exactly like me as i also was best student in HS but struggled at math and now i wasted my life in college changing between majors\nI hope best luck to you",

At the uni I attend part-time after the second year I get to choose either accounting or finance and I screwed up by not choosing finance because I had plans to \"learn something practical and not so theoretical\" (and now I don't, I would just prefer to get a piece of paper in econ/finance to put on my CV to give me some options even outside this fields) and did not inform myself well enough to realize that finance has the better program and would give me better options. I don't know why but my reasoning was stupid. I know that I screwed up. I can only switch to finance at the end of the school year with excellent grades, which is near impossible, especially when depressed. The system is too bureaucratic, unfortunately. I contacted deans, etc. to ask whether I could try making a different choice next summer, to no avail. It's like I was sentenced to this program... \n\nI work full time and support myself fully so I might quit the university course at this point and pursue those courses that actually interest me outside of uni... and then come back or try to switch the university to another one just to complete a different program (econ/finance), if possible and if the syllabus is compatible, as they seem to differ from one university to another.

I haven't studied really due to depression, the course is getting more and more intense (there isn't much teaching, we're supposed to learn by ourselves, as they only have 1 weekend to \"teach\" us their technical subjects, and there's a lot to cram so I would barely pass, and only by cheating probably), so my option now is to drop it and try to focus on my actual interests through courses outside of university. This degree potentially would not be useful now anyway. I have no intention of working in accounting or audit. I don't even know about consulting or analysis. I have a job I like and even if I no longer do, I would likely have to take up an outsourced support/sales job and still be okay financially as the pay is acceptable for my country's standards. If a finance program could offer me a financial internship (analysis, consulting) of some sort, then it might be a little better, though I would still prefer a job in tech/SEO/IT. If I'm not cut out for IT, my creativity and attention to detail could at least be useful in marketing, if I manage to make a breakthrough there, I don't know. \n\nIf I was to do it over again, I would choose economics or even marketing, as it would be easier to pass or help me get a foot in the door in terms of the latter (along with a course in digital marketing which I would probably attend sooner or later), but the bureaucratic system won't let me choose one of those at this point as it probably has to do with filled quotas or something. Whenever I ask some person of authority, they either don't know and redirect me to someone who is supposed to, and when I make an enquiry to that said person, I get no reply. It's stupid how pointless in terms of time and money it would be to go through the same subjects just to change my program as accounting, finance, economics and marketing have pretty much the same program during the first 2 years (I even mentioned that in a way to the Rector of academic affairs in my query... as it's ridiculous...). \n\nI asked a relative who has connections in another even easier uni to see if it would be possible to transfer some or all of the credits next year to an easier school and be 3rd year again just to complete a program in finance/economics/marketing just as a formal credential (and not look too much into what I would learn as I used to), but I don't know.\n\nAnyway, I'll figure it out one way or another, but it's likely that at this point I'll not be going any further in this program, despite the fact that I really don't want to drop out yet again and just want it to be over, even if I barely pass (here a D is fine for you to go through, but changing your course is near impossible, as you can see). I made a choice back when I was depressed that if I couldn't get a degree in CompSci/engineering, I would at least study something practical and get a shitty job that pays okay until I die, I didn't listen to my gut feeling that it's not for me and it resulted in me getting depressed once again. Needless to say, I regret it. It seems like I got really lost and this might be a sign that I have to find myself.\n\nThanks for your concern and sorry for the wall of text, I'm just materializing my thoughts because I always live inside my head, and, right now, it's hurting like hell.",

Dropping out and adding another 1.5 years to complete econ or marketing is better choice, its not late. Im 22 too and as i said im thinking to do programming courses and MBA later so i need atleast more 5 year in college. What really matters is where do you see yourself in more 20 years? Do you see yourself successful in a job you like or depressed and cursing a job you hate? Sacrificing more 1.5 year to live your rest of your life happy is better IMO. I really was exactly in the same boat as you, believe me you will be happy in your new major. You already work a job you like so you are not wasting the years.",

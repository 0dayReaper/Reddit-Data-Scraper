    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI don't know what the point of this post will be, I'm just lost.\n\nOn paper I should be happy. tall, physically healthy, built, average-ish looks, white, male. middle class job with an attractive wife, multiple pets, bought a home a few years ago that has increased in value quite a bit. I'm safe, financially ok (not close to homeless but paycheck to paycheck, like most people) but I feel beaten. I feel like the weight of the demands of work, spouse, home maintenance, chores, etc. is crushing me.\n\nI have never been close to my family, (typical, poor, uneducated, abusive) so I don't talk to them except a couple times a year to say hey and get a life update on everyone.\n\nI don't have a single person I would call friend.\n\nI have co workers who only see the person I have to be at work, but its not me. \n\nMy wife see's the person I feel I'm supposed to be, but its not me. \n\nThe problem is, I don't know who I am either...\n\nI don't enjoy anything really. my wife truly tries to help by including me in her hobbies and activities, but something in me always get angry or annoyed because I can feel the requirement to be something I'm not, at all times. \n\nI used to play video games all the time, and sometimes I still do to pass time, but I wouldn't call it enjoyment or fun. just passing time. \n\nI try to not spend much money to attempt to save as much as possible, so that the stress of money doesn't crush me even harder.\n\nSo I'm lost, in a maze of my own creation, wrapped in walls made from others demands, expectations, and no matter how I try to \"grow\" or change or do more, I cant find the exit...\n\nI still don't know who I am.... or how to make myself happy again... like I used to be.\n\nI've never written out my feelings before, so maybe someone else will see this and know they aren't alone.\n\nThank you for reading.",

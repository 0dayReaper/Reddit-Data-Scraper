    "postText": "I\u2019ve been depressed before. but never like this. i found out that my suspensions of my dad taking his own life confirmed, years later. i logged into an old email account and found three emails from him, before the day he passed, on my 21st birthday. i lost it since. \n\nI attempted myself. and now i just live in a shell of a human. I took short term disability from my job, and all i do is sit at home, drink, cut myself beyond repair, and sleep. \n\nall i do is sit as a shell of a human, breathe, and breathe and breathe. I trashed my apartment, broke everything i could, anger was good, it was a feeling, but now i\u2019m just empty. i\u2019m nothing. i just breathe. I want to accept help, but i just can\u2019t. i just breathe.\n\ni feel stuck in a rut. for everything that\u2019s wrong. my cancer, the abusive family that i ran away from, and add last insult to injury, my father, that killed himself, on my 21st birthday. is there a way out? realistically, is there? i don\u2019t see it. \n\ni want to feel anything right now, to even cry would be a miracle, but i just breathe. i\u2019m even tempted to get my hands on hard drugs just to feel something, but i don\u2019t even have the stamina to coordinate that. how does one get out of a hole so deep? i barely mustered the stamina to type this.",

Today I didn't touch alcohol, that's a good day just for it. I can only set very small goals. Better than nothing. The only good thing is that I don't care anymore about anyone and what they think. I am a bit more free.",

If I can get some exercise it usually helps. \n\nIf you\u2019re self-harming maybe look into an PHO or IOP for some help. It\u2019s a difficult phone call to make but they usually take insurance. It was helpful for me.",

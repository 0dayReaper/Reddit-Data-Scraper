            "comment": "Is there any long term Reason I am bit older then you, so got bit more experience one can feel this way I felt this way too. one thing i Learn was Family cares if they are not completely Shit they do care. I'll tell what has worked for me during those time first give your self some space don't try to solve it all at once what one need in overwhelming condition a bit space take a break not in a way go out and spend money. for some time everyday disassociate yourself from the chaos it does help it will take some practice.  Once you get out of this state you in your life will be able to help people around you in such situation, we all want help and that's Ok but we owe to people around us that we also give a helping hand to someone in need.  may or may not be there any reason to live and keep going but what would be like to come out of darkness to the light. you would feel great, you family some of your friends and you with your light could bring someone out of darkness. go through it for yourself, people around you, it may change you change for good and we as society need good people those who came out of darkness and now spreading the light.\n\nTake care mate, always there for help.",

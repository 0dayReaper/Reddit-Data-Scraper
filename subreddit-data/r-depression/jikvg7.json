That maybe you've made the same mistakes enough times that you could point them out and stop repeating them.\n\nIt's the idea that, you know how not to be depressed, so if you still are, then that means you must want it this way.

Depression is an illness which comes on gradually over time. It can start slowly and before you know it, it\u2019s taken over your mindset and life.\nBeing lazy shouldn\u2019t be confused with a serious mental illness. Usually, if you\u2019re just feeling lazy, it\u2019s a passing mood that lasts a day or two. Soon enough, you get up, and gather the energy to go to classes and catch up on your tasks.\nPeople with depression don\u2019t have that ability. They\u2019ve lost all concept of meaning in their life, of time, and responsibilities. It just doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing matters.",

And what if your friends are sick and tired of your depressive episodes? In my case, it was exactly that. My friends were tired of me sharing what I was going through (well, they didn't tell me, I asked because when you are depressed you feel like a burden to everyone). My family stopped me from therapy because for them it was waste of money and time (even when I told them it was helpful). They told me they can be my therapist but they haven't heard me out ever, because they are too busy or too tired.\nSo my point is, sometimes it's better not to share it with anyone. Most depressed people don't even know why they are depressed so when they try to explain it to their friends/family, it sounds unconvincing and it makes more harm than good for the actual suffering person. At least my experience makes me feel that way.",

                                    "comment": "edit: tl;dr all-day meditation for a week lifted me out of depression. Felt happiness, peace, clarity. Life-long traumas no longer haunted me. Diminished chronic pains. Eliminated my anxiety. Was 100% in the present moment. But the lack of clarity made me give up: \"how long do I need to meditate all-day for? what's the end goal?\"\n\n--\n\nI distinctly remember what happened - it was a really long build-up. \n\nWhen I found out all my symptoms were classified as depression, I made the decision to take time off to invest in my mental health. This was late 2016. In other words, there were 2 years where I did absolutely nothing but lay in bed. There was 1 year where I tried to finish college but avoided work, socializing, etc. I gave up a really lucrative full-time job to pursue aggressive therapy. \n\nEver since COVID started and left us in quarantine in March, I slowly started to realize that nothing I was doing was helping me. All the solutions I have found weren't making a change (CBT, mindfulness, hypnosis, meditation, thought management/replacement, work out!, find passionate things!, record small progress!, keep a diary!, write!, etc). I did everything but nothing was getting better - specifically, I did everything but I wasn't feeling any better about myself. I knew I have two options: either I truly hurt myself in a devastating way to end life or I give it my all to live a different life. \n\nThe rationale is right, but my mind was fighting back for months. It didn't matter if every single day I knew I had to do things differently b/c my mind was set on being depressed. \n\nI hit 24-years-old in September. The desperation to change was real. I just knew that I could get to 30, 40, 50, then death if I don't finally find something that works.\n\nI was still unemployed. Graduation approved for college. Basically in bed all day again. Still getting therapy. I decided to take my meditation practice to the next level. I was doing it all DAY, every day. Even if my mind wandered back to its self-destructive thoughts, I still tried my best to focus. The week of 9/19 to 9/27, I experienced miracles. For one, I was so present in the moment that I didn't have obsessive, destructive thoughts. This is HUGE. My college, family, &amp; social traumas have haunted me for 6 years and for me to not get disturbed by those thoughts is a MIRACLE!!!!! Not one in 4 days but the remaining few days, things were returning back to normal (explained later). Two, those thoughts trigger my anxiety 24/7 and anxiety was GONE! I have PTSD and for me to say anxiety was gone for a good few days is a huge accomplishment. Three, all of that mental clarity led to physical changes for me -- my 20+ year migraine went away. Chronic pain diminished. Lots of other physical changes. I realized that \"your mind makes your body\" was accurate. My pains were always debilitating but inexplicable - it is, it's my depression and other mental illnesses. Four, I actually felt happy. I wasn't weighed down by my horrible past. I was genuinely living in the moment. I remember going to bed crying all 4 nights because I was so grateful that my life is going to change. I might be scared of the change but it really was going to happen! \n\nThe only reason I couldn't maintain this was because I didn't know what to do next and that lack of clarity/expectations made my mind go back to what it's comfortable doing: being depressed. I just kept thinking... was the goal to master meditation so I carry that peace everywhere? I just couldn't fully embrace the unknown even though I had nothing to lose - again, I can write, say, and think all of these logical things but my mind is another beast. Meanwhile, my life was rapidly getting out of control. I had one simple, full-time job coming up that I waited 8 months for. Pandemic really seemed to have no end and I knew I needed the money, making me further regret that I gave up 300k+ by giving up a full-time job for 2 years. I just had to get back to life like I used to: get a job, make money, solve problems. \n\nRight now, for the first time in 7 years, I'm actually feeling the burning burning burning desperation I had to find a job when I was 15. I've been avoiding working all along to not worsen the depression but whether I work or not, it's still there. For me to suddenly feel this urge is a good sign that I can handle life even if depressed, but I continually wonder whether those moments of peace, clarity, and happiness I felt for just 1 week could continue being my life as I do everything else. \n\nThis very moment, I'm trying to combine everything I know -- use the meditation to achieve a level of peace and happiness while potentially curing my chronic pains once and for all (well well, they returned the moment depression resurfaced for 4 weeks), capitalize this desperation to work &amp; succeed b/c I know the accomplishment will give me a mental boost that'll lead to the next opportunity, and just keep solving problems. Right now, I am finally able to read and focus for the first time in my whole life -- depression never allowed me to focus and made me daydream to escape reality, but desperation to move forward is allowing me to read. \n\nMy progress has been unpredictable but one thing I've learned is that when you feel a burning intuition to do xyz, you have to do it. You must succeed and see yourself as worthwhile, then keep doing that. That reverses my depression faster than anything else.",

I haven\u2019t really developed a meditation practice but your story has me thinking about doing so.\n\nSeems like you made a HUGE breakthrough (with getting some amount of burning desire to do things back) and that sustaining it will be a more gradual change but possible.\n\nOne thing I noticed about your story (sorry if I am wrong) is that you seem to be relatively socially isolated? I am wondering if that has an impact on your depression as well. Or does the quality of your social life has no impact on your depression? Johann Hari\u2019s \u201cLost Connections\u201d suggest that social causes and lack of community and sense of belonging are major factors in depression. \n\nCongratulations on your breakthrough! \nWishing you the best going forward! !",

The truth is no one would knowingly choose to suffer this hell if he knew any better. Looking at healthy happy people doesn't give you any knowledge as to how they are doing it. In fact even they have no idea how; they were just blessed with a healthy mind. So those people can preach until the sun is blue how you should do that and think that, but it's complete bs. If I could I surely would",

I've petulantly decided this is what I want. I'm mooching off my parents, barely paying the minimum amount of bills I have working one day a week. And I've havent been this stress free (outside of ya know...lifetime stressors like my parents are old and its 2020) since the last time I wasnt working. Between my last job and my \"current\" job (but also previous job to my last job) I've just realized I cant physically or mentally do it anymore. It's a slow burning chemical on my existence. And I just refuse. I cant stand it. I'm actually creating again, and being organized, and spending equal parts quality time and arguing with my family, and adoring my pets. I dont want to lose this. But I have to. Like this mix of existential dread and anger and petulance overwhelms me even thinking of working even part time again. \n\nAnd it's like you said, I feel like I'm chosing depression, chosing to stagnate rather than grow. I reject it, reject the world, reject people.\n\nAnd I know what I \"should\" do, but it just calcifies my anger, because nothing I actually want in the world is obtainable with the tools and resources I have.

For people like us it\u2019s not as simple as wanting something and going for it. We have to wrestle with how, why, when we will do something and go over the consequences of each action meticulously and endlessly until exhaustive research has been complete. Sometimes to no avail at all. Circular logic etc is the bane of our existence. So I just shut my brain up and go do what I want to do and after I\u2019m done I see what reactions I get from others. So far it\u2019s been fine. When I\u2019m alone I tell myself I embarrassed myself blah blah blah and I get into these fits of despair and turmoil.

I couldn't imagine the person I would be if I wasn't depressed. Would I like that person? Would people like me? Would things be any different than they are now?\n\nI made up a theory when I was in high school, and I called it the potted-plant theory. Depression was the plant, and your soul/self was the soil in the pot. The plant grows, spreading its roots into the soil. If you pull the plant out, it takes much if not all of the soil with it.

I hope that I\u2019m not too late, but I\u2019ll show you why this is not true. \n\nI blame the psychotherapy industry for creating this narrative. Psychotherapy is based on the ideas of \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d and \u201cindividualism\u201d that align heavily with American culture. Psychotherapy is unique to Western culture, and interestingly enough shares many similarities with Witch Doctors in other cultures. \n\nOften I hear the phrase \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, but it is your responsibility\u201d from the psychotherapy community. It\u2019s a nice thought, but assumes that an individual somehow has the power to influence *everything* around them, including their own thoughts and feelings. Psychotherapy unfairly shames the distressed individual into thinking that they simply want to be miserable. This works excellently for our capitalistic society that depends on maintaining power structures. People who think that their distress is their own fault are much less likely to complain. \n\nYou simply cannot help how you feel, choose what to think, or decide how to behave. There is no single \u201cagent\u201d in your brain that is making decisions. There is no \u201cCEO of self.\u201d You are the embodiment of your interactions with the world throughout your life and into the present. Despite free will and responsibility being necessary concepts for society, they are born out of illusion. \n\nWhat I would encourage others to consider is what it is in their environment, both past and present, that has contributed to these feelings. We exist and are created *within our environment*. We don\u2019t feel depressed for no reason. There\u2019s a reason that depression is highly correlated with past trauma, poverty, etc. Of course, your unique biology and lack of access to social support may make you more vulnerable to negative impact by external stressors. \n\nThe power that you have to change these things are likely extremely limited, otherwise you would\u2019ve done something about them already. Past events are suspended far in space-time beyond your current reach, and to blame yourself for being unable to change the effects of them is absolutely ridiculous. Nonetheless, I\u2019d encourage everyone to consider what sources of strength they have that they may have never considered. For many people this is their relationships, but it can be anything. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is *this is not your fault*. Nobody would ask to be miserable. That\u2019s the whole point of misery\u2014 that we don\u2019t want it. There\u2019s no easy answer to any of this, but at the very least you\u2014 and all of the people here, deserve to suffer with dignity.",

I struggled a lot making friends when I was younger, and spent a lot of time alone. I got dropped by a friend group who didn\u2019t care about me and my solution was to do nothing. Please learn from my mistakes. Meet new people however you can, you will find people that treat you how you deserve. Meet them through hobbies, like art? Or maybe a sport? Talk to new people and try to meet people however you can. It\u2019s so worth it to expand your circle in order to find the people you deserve. Also, could you talk to your friends now about how you are feeling? Is that possibl?",

I planned and tried to take my own life unfortunately I failed I took a handful of painkillers and just woke up the next day and instead of not being here I just threw up that whole day I want to try again and hopefully be successful this time but I don\u2019t want to let my little siblings down I just feel hopeless I just someone to talk will I be ok.",

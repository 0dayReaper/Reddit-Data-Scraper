    "postText": "In a few hours I should fly to see one of my friends in London and then see a Harry Styles concert. I am extremely thankful for having the opportunity to do this experience but a couple of hours ago my friend texted me saying she was sick and ghosted me. I am supposed to go sleep at her house so it\u2019s a big issue. I can\u2019t stop thinking that I\u2019m the problem, I am so tired of trying so hard to keep my friendship alive despite the monsters in my head, I can literally say that I didn\u2019t ended my life because I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of hurting them.  I try and try and try but i feel like I am the only one trying. They are going on with their lives and I\u2019m trying to climb out of a black hole desperately trying to be at their level. My black hole is getting deeper and I seriously don\u2019t know how I will manage to get out of here.",

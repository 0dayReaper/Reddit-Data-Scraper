    "postText": "I went from a high achieving athlete with a 3.9 gpa to a student who is barely passing and acting sick to avoid school. Is this what depression feels like? I\u2019ve gained 5 pounds. Been ordering takeout EVERY day. Stopped going to the gym. Haven\u2019t showered in a week. I\u2019ve went from prioritizing sleep from sleeping at 8pm-5am to sleeping at 4am-12pm. The only thing that I\u2019ve done is played video games, ate, and slept. \n\nAm I depressed? Is this what depression feels like? I am not really sad. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m unmotivated and uninterested in everything. \n\nI promised myself I\u2019d never become like this. I thought I could never be depressed. I didn\u2019t think I could ever stop playing the sports I used to love and stopped trying at school. What is wrong with me? \n\nThis all started because of school. I hate it there. I\u2019m forced to go there. I can transfer to the school with my friends. What should i do? I feel lost. I feel empty. I feel like I\u2019m ready to throw in the towel and call it. Ready to accept this shitty life.",

There are limited things to do in this world .  \n\nYou can go somewhere , you can do something .  \nYou don't feel like doing things .   \n\nMaybe you have to build back to doing things that are hard and succeed at at least little things.   \n\nJust do little things until you can do bigger things again , unless you think transferring schools will fix the problem .",

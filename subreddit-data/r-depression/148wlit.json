    "postText": "I\u2019ve always struggled with depression since I was in elementary/middle school. After I graduated high school my depression got better but my anxiety spiked up, learned to deal with anxiety and I got so happy thinking I fixed myself. \n\nEveryday I wake up not wanting to go to work, some days it\u2019s mentally so difficult to do so. I\u2019m barely sleeping, I\u2019m barely eating, and I smoke everyday to help cope. I feel like I\u2019m such a big ass disappointment, I\u2019m 22 with no degree (that I do want but I struggle with school), and I want to quit my FT job that I\u2019m hating.\n\nNo matter how hard I try to be genuinely happy it rarely ever lasts and I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019ll never be truly happy. I can\u2019t even talk to my friends about how I feel without feeling like they don\u2019t care, and I can\u2019t talk to my family about it without being secretly judged..\n\nI\u2019m FUCKING TIRED.",

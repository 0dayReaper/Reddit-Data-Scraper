    "postText": "I don\u2019t how to explain it properly, but basically for my whole life I\u2019ve always felt a sense that there was something wrong with my existence. Like I\u2019m not meant to be here, and I\u2019m being punished, but for what I don\u2019t know. If I had known my life was going to turn out this way, even with the few good things that have happened, I still wouldn\u2019t have chosen to be born. There are too many problems in my life and I feel like I\u2019m not equipped to deal with all of them. \n\nNo one told me that I was going to be an only child with parents who decided to put all their eggs into one basket and force me to take their desired career path. And while I have decided not to do that, I\u2019m just seen as a \u201cdisappointment.\u201d \n\nNo one told me how hard it was going to be to find friends in every school that I went to. That the only friends I would get would be ones who weren\u2019t actually interested in being friends or super shitty ones. And although I have better friends now, I still feel out of place because I can\u2019t relate to so many of the fun experiences that they\u2019ve had with their friends in the past. \n\nNo one told me that I wasn\u2019t going to be accepted to get my desired degree and instead had to do the one that my parents wanted instead. \n\nNo one told me that something extremely horrible would happen to me and that I wouldn\u2019t get any help from the people who were supposed to help me. That I would still have to deal with the repercussions of what happened today. \n\nNo one told me that I would be forced to do so many things that I didn\u2019t actually want to do. And doing these things did not improve my life that much or at all. \n\nNo one told me I would have to deal with so many mental health issues because of the things that happened to me. \n\nI never asked to be here. I never asked to be alive. If I were to receive some magic button that erases my existence, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to press it.",

            "comment": "I know this struggle all too well. I know what it feels like when what you want to do with your life isn\u2019t considered good enough for others. I think a lot of parents do this and I honestly think they have good intentions, but it\u2019s your life. Sometimes parents are set in their ways and there is really no way to please them. You need to do what is best for you regardless of what anyone says. You\u2019re not a disappointment, you just want to live your life which is completely valid. I wish I would have done what I wanted to do with my life because I feel like I\u2019d be way happier now and I wouldn\u2019t dread going to work every day. Finding true friends is definitely a challenge so you\u2019re not alone with that. A lot of people these days only provide one sided friendships which is really unfortunate. You\u2019re around for them but they never show up for you. I\u2019m really sorry that something horrible happened to you and you had to deal with it alone. No one should have to feel like that. Life is really hard and you\u2019re not alone. I hope things start to get better for you soon.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for your reply. I needed it. The few times that I did feel happy were when I actually did things for myself and not to please someone else. Finding real friends is challenging nowadays, but I also feel like it's been especially hard for me for my whole life. At every school or club I've entered, everyone else basically already had a friend or just didn't want any more friends. The only reason I found my current better friends was through literal luck, not through school or work. But at the same time, I don't know how long it's going to last considering how many things unexpectedly go wrong in my life. I've already gone through long periods in my life where I was basically alone and I can't stand it anymore. \n\nI feel like I will have to make big changes to my life soon and what scares me is the uncertainty. Because so many things have gone wrong in my life, I don't know for sure if I'll get to achieve my dreams. Life truly is hard and I wish it came with an instruction manual. And in the end, I still prefer to not exist.",

    "postText": "So I was diagnosed with depression a month ago, psychiatrist prescribed me vortioxetine and I\u2019ve been taking it for almost a month now. \n\nThe changes arent many, I get a solid an hour-two hours tops of joyous feeling, and the rest of the day I\u2019m just lazy, numb, easily distracted, exhausted, and irritated. \n\n\nDo I talk to my psychiatrist to increase my dosage? Do I tell him to change my medication??\n\n\nI\u2019m gonna try to workout tho it\u2019s not gonna be easy to push myself to workout, I can barely leave the bed in the morning let alone going to the gym",

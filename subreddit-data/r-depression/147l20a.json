    "postText": "In my whole life I believed I was worthless unattractive and stupid. I feel like I don't live, I'm just existing. I don't know what to do in my free time I get easily tired and not worthy to do it. I have a job which really fucks up my anxiety and my physical endurance but I can't quit that easily cause I need money. Also I broke up 5 months ago. I had a relationship with a gaslighter narcissistic person who is 25 and he likes 14 years old girls. I lost it when I found out but before this the issue between us was that he didn't respect me at all and spoke all the time about his ex. When he lost interest in me he didn't tell me that he wanted end this relationship so he gave me the silent treatment. I was so confused what to do my anxiety got to another level I didn't eat, I cried and panicking easily. He also didn't want to touch me so imagine that my self esteem got lower than a grave. Anyways I'm trying to silent this thoughts but today I feel like no one will ever fall in love with me and if I find someone I don't feel even the confidence anymore to make love. I was going to the therapist for 2 years but I stopped it last week for economic issues.",

It's like slowly drowning me. Also now I have more trust issues about people than I did before. I'm trying to change my mindset and I was in a good but today I don't know why It's like I never tried to change it.",

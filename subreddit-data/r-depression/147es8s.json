    "postText": "Hey guys, i have a history of being a workoholic for 12-13hrs a day until i finally broke and burned out. I went to a psychiatrist, tried some meds and finally fluoxetine worked. I was having minor OCD, racing mind, increased anxiety etc. Now all things have improved but suddenly for past few months I feel exhausted with life. It's like nothing interests me anymore, be it money, love, my goals nothing is exciting me. The idea of sucide is normalising with time, life seems worthless. It's like I'm just struggling/working but not getting satisfied or happy. Idk what to do",

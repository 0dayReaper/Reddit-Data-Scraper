I\u2019ve found it really helpful to remember what depression is and isn\u2019t (at least in my understanding - I have no medical or psychological training, just going off my own experiences). Feeling sad/down/some other negative emotions are a natural part of life and actually help us navigate the world. Sad/scary/other negative things happen in life and feeling negative emotions is a normal and helpful response. If my feelings correspond to the reality of what\u2019s going on, I\u2019m not too worried that my overall mental health has taken a downward spiral. It\u2019s when my feelings don\u2019t match whats going on that I take special note and maybe start to think about where I can find support if I need it. \n\nWhen my metal health was at its lowest point, I barely felt anything at all. Good things didn\u2019t make feel good, sad things didn\u2019t make me feel sad etc. Spent more of the time feeling numb - but negative feelings were easier to access so I would deliberately dwell on things of try and make myself feel awful, just so I could feel something. I now understand that pattern of thought as being something akin to emotional self harm, I had CBT (as well as being on meds) and it massively helped break the cycle. As I started feeling better, any kind of feeling was evidence that my mind was functioning better and my mental health was improving. Even negative feelings felt weirdly good, as I was able to see that they were appropriate responses to what was going on in my life.\n\nDon\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful for you OP, but mainly wanted to say that feeling down isn\u2019t necessarily a relapse and so isn\u2019t necessarily something to be scared of. If by relapse you mean that you\u2019ve felt worse in the past but are currently feeling better then it sounds like you will have learnt lots about yourself and your mood, so even if you do have something of a relapse you\u2019re in a much stronger position to manage it well, know how to help yourself and how to ask for help.\n\nHope you\u2019re doing okay :)",

    "postText": "(22m, black)\n\nHow does one \u201clove themselves\u201d?\n\nWhenever I ponder this question in my room at home, I always feel empty, cold, and lonely. I have never been comfortable talking about my feelings or mental state. So now at 22, I am truly paying the emotional price for never have having someone to talk to during childhood.\n\nMy question involving self-love heeds answers that go beyond the protocol to combatting body dysmorphia (which has already shook me to the core as I am only a 5\u20197, not even close to being well-endowed \u201cman\u201d). I want to know how to be comfortable and confident within and not be stuck in a mental loop of remembering malicious events that led to my current state.\n\nI have no car, no social circle, no job, and only a small bit of money from my college graduation. Often I wish I wasn\u2019t alive and it results in me hating myself even more for allowing myself to become entrapped in such a mindset. I hate that im so introverted and socially anxious I cant make new friends and can barely keep old ones. I dont even know of enough people to invite to my eventual wedding (yes, random, but has plagued my mind since I was 18)\n\nAll I ask for is some advice. How can I accept myself for who I am and forget the past? I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take this mental state. This is well and truly my last cry for help.\n\nThank you for reading, and I wish you best of luck facing your own life\u2019s problems. We will get through this.",

            "comment": "I definitely struggle with the concept as well, and it helps to think of it as self-grace or self-compassion instead of like positive mirror affirmations (though this helps some people). I can relate to not being good at talking about feelings because I was a pretty lonely kid. But that's a reason. It's not some ingrained flaw within yourself, it was circumstances. So by that reasoning, would you judge a person for things out of their control? I don't think you would, so you have to consciencely show yourself that same grace. I think for me personally, recognizing when people grow up with a big support system, or with a well-off family, life generally isn't as tough. But because I didn't have those things, do I not deserve happiness? Of course I deserve it as much as any other person. It makes me a little bitter but it's better to be bitter and alive than not around.  \n\n\nAnd I'm gonna sound old, but 22 is still quite young. I was around 26 or 27 before I started to feel like \"myself\" and not some scared child just trying to get through the day (she's still there, but I have self-grace there too to sooth her). I used to have the same worries about my wedding but at this point, I barely even care to have one, and if I did, I'd just elope to vegas or something.   \n\n\nLife is tough but you deserve to be here, I hope you can move forward with more kindness for yourself.",

            "comment": "I've asked myself the same question and have approached answering it in two ways\n\nThe first way is that  I think about how I view others in need of support. I could use you as an example. I see you as having inherent worth because you're a human being, and I feel empathy towards you because you're suffering. I then consider myself and realise I too am the same, having inherent worth because I'm a human being, and thus I try to extend the same compassion to myself\n\nThe second way is that I think about my baby brother (8 yrs old) who I adore and cherish. I consider the way that I treat him, and try to replicate that with myself, e.g. I always encourage him, I validate his feelings, I focus on his strengths and praise him for them, I feed him nutritious food, I comfort him when he is sad or scared, etc.",

    "postText": "So today got 3 calls from the doctors as 1st one I missed because was on bus to college, 2nd one I missed because I was getting yelled at by my teacher for reading slow even tho she knows I'm dyslexic. So the 3rd one I answer and after talking she said I definitely have sleep issues (4 hours max but usually 3) and then she diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. She said I scored \"very very high on both of the tests\" and that 3 on any shows signs of them. So she is dealing with anxiety and sleep when I can go in in 2 weeks but wrote a prescription for the depression. All the 3rd call happened whilst I was in sainsburys. I just find it a little bit funny I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety in sainsburys. Is just funny to me.",

You eat because otherwise you will suffer. The same goes with other needs. It is a chore, a service to your meat prison because without it you are nothing. Even our existence is not our choice.   \n\n\nBut whenewer I think about death, I understand that I actually have a choice. It is not great, but I can end it all if I feel so. ",

Now I'm old and my life still sucks.\n\nI also think that once you have this thought, you can never go back. Life becomes a choice. Most people never make this choice, it's automatic. Just like breathing. But for us, every day, we have to make the choice to live. This becomes a burden the same way that consciously breathing would be a burden. It requires focus and discipline. For others, life just happens. It's just what you do. For us, it's a constant struggle. I hope to one day move past this, but I'm in my 30s and so far no dice. Maybe our brains are just broken.",

Alan Watts talks about this at length in one of his talks and it really helped me to understand why we feel that way and the power behind it, because it really is a powerful thought and really doesn\u2019t *have* to be a morbid thought.\n\nHis explanation is something like; when you fundamentally realize that it\u2019s within your control to end this experience if you chose to, you realize also that you don\u2019t actually have to. The pressures of it all cease to be so overbearing when you consciously choose to continue in your experience rather than feeling trapped by it.",

Emotions are brief, shortlived. \n\nMoods are like seasons, emotions are like the weather on any particular day. Depression is like a long, cold and hard winter. Sure, there are days when the temperature is tollerable, you migh even get a couple of hours once every 2nd or 3rd week when the sun pops out and it's actually a little warm, but for the majority of the time, it's almost always below freezing.  \n\n\nSome people never experience low mood, they experience negative emotions, they are brief, lasting a couple of hours, couple of days. \n\nMajority of people have gone through rough patches in their life when their mood has hit something aproximating a chilly autumm, but an unfortunate few experience that cold, hard winter. So they tell you to put on some warm clothing and tell you platitudes about perseverence and toughening up and bla bla bla, because they've only been out on a chilly autumm day and dont know how it is to be cold to the bone.\n\nWe all want to return to baseline mood, sweater weather, a nice and warm spring day. Not to hot, not to cold, just right. For some, it takes alot of time before the temperature creeps up again and I wish that you all get to feel that warmth again.",

Even if you did, how can you guarantee that such a thing wouldn't be painful?\n\nSetbacks make us stronger.\n\nOh, I have a lifetime of setbacks, everything I set out to do just gets decimated at some point in life, in a very significant way. It hasn't made me strong; it only has made me rough around the edges. Pressure doesn't harden formed glass; it only cracks it, creating sharp edges at odd angles.\n\nI guess I'll just have to wear the mask of understanding on my part, but in reality, they don't really understand me, nor do I really expect them to.",

Unless they've gone through, or ARE going through significant Depression (MDD, or BPD as well - in my case combined with a long history of anxiety/panic/ocd) it's beyond difficult to explain.    I'm still trying to figure out a way to communicate everything to someone who has been fortunate enough to never have to endure this type of mental illness - but holy shit it's difficult.   \n\nAlso, especially Parents, because you're the most important thing in their lives - Good Parents would always, ALWAYS want to and be willing to do practically anything within reason to help you.   It's also hard to understand this unless you have your own children - but though it sometimes gets annoying being asked over and over \"what's wrong\" - \"how can we make this go away, or get better?\"    \n\nI'm sure I'm not alone here in that we've spent time explaining as best we can the symptoms, how it makes you feel (depleted of energy, unable to do mundane / everyday tasks, difficult to concentrate, difficult to find any real happiness or joy in things you used to love doing, and the list goes on.   Guilt is a big one for me as well.      \n\n\nLike I said - I'm still waiting to see if there's a better way to communicate to those closest to me (Family and the couple best friends I'm fortunate enough to have) what it feels like, how it isn't a light switch I can just turn off and on.   That the boatload of SSRI's and other meds over the years have just not done the job.     It's a vicious cycle - having people who truly want to help, which is EXTREMELY fortunate \\[lots of people going through all of this shit have NOBODY\\]    \n\nIt's a big problem.   There's still a stigma attached with mental health in general despite some attempts here and there to put it more \"out there\".    It's going to take something more - I don't know what.    \n\nI think obviously it's a huge reason why a lot of us flock to these forums...... We can understand one another - and as a lot of you know, it's not that \"What's the problem / Let's find the FIX for it, TONIGHT!\"    --- Often times, we're just looking for someone to listen..... Someone to talk to, sure - but understanding this runs deep in most of us, and it's not some overnight fix (IMO). \n\nKeep heads up everyone.....     Check in and let us all know who things are going.    These are really, really rough times for a lot of us.    For the WORLD actually.     I wish mental health was brought up MORE and MORE.     Enough with all this bullshit NEWS and bullshit POLITICS that does NOTHING....  \n\nYou want to talk about a \"Silent Killer\" , or a \"Silent Disease\" -   It's MENTAL HEALTH.    MDD/BPD/GAD/OCD and the list goes on and on as you guys know.",

My mom is always saying things like \"it's nice to see you've been feeling better,\" as if you can see feelings, when I laugh at a joke or manage to cook or exercise one day. Those are moments, not patterns, and even patterns don't necessarily mean depression is over either. I'm sorry your parents are saying that stuff to you. It can be exhausting to have to explain mental illness to people when you're already going through it.",

Being high functioning has been a complete shit curse for me, it spiralled and turned into the most debilitating thing I've ever had, lower than being low.\n\nIt's not trying to make this about me but the stereotype that if you' re not acting out your symptoms that fit in this category, then you're definitely not in the to the book by the book form of depression. Same for ocd, fucking rile what ocd has turned into. I have intense flashbacks and intrusive thoughts of my own mum masturbating infront of me by my face, obsessively thinking that what if this happens. I couldn't give a shit about washing my dishes, or making sure all the nucleus of bacteria is tended to so they don't harm my ocd cleaning. Obsessing about a rockstar is not obsession.\n\nYou don't have to fit into the category your parents are trying to put you in their heads in. You can go on a huge tour of the world, learning and loving with people, they each give you 1 million pounds on this tour. You could still be miserable and fake this exchange on this ride. You could have an insane time, but the few days in your hotel room you could be wishing so hard to overdose. You could be cry laughing and a few moments you finished your balance will adjust to painful depression.\n\nEmotions are as unique as finger prints. Just having certain behaviours can be categorised which helps us. What your thought pattern of depression is will be totally different to someone else's.",

I think it is more complex for both sides of life, but when you have a kid, I'm thinking parents don't want to believe their children can be depressed as they have had to endure, and in some form it can develop into your adulthood and become a lot more worse with behaviour problems/more psychiatric mental health issues. There are a lot more triggering components in life in adulthood. At the end of this, it still does not matter and is not excuse, we should invite the idea in and try and make adjustments.\n\nYou're right, I don't mind hearing a cold slice of humble pie or the truth. The only reason I won't act on this is because I'm aware of how shit things were when getting support, I was too busy from the therapist point of view as I work shifts, so after my second 12 week wait it was just crushing to be let off the hook again. I'm constantly in the obsession that I should call someone but then the cycle of i want to burst and just have someone wipe my damn ass or anything, to I don't want to see anyone. Obsession is so awful urgh. Gotta fight the cycle.\n\nThanks stranger for the advice, we all know what's right but we can be huge walking contradictions because of our meat sacks in our heads",

Talking to ourselves for once and saying things like my depression can be an inconvenience sometimes but not that it is stupid. It's not stupid that it was already implanted in us to have perfectly normal emotions to the side effects of stress or emotional things. I just haven't practiced it enough to let it stick because of the contradiction. Try watching some of sadghuru stuff on YT, he's very logical and far from snake oil theory.\n\nI hope you slowly wein into things and find them far from anxious, try and practice once in a while reminder. Also from all this isolation, get on them vitamin D and k2 tablets (has to be together not vit d on its own) this will help from the incredible crushing fatigue a lot of us are experiencing on top of the depression from pandemonium land",

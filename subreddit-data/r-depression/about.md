Description:

Peer support for anyone struggling with a depressive disorder.

Rules:

Posts must request personal support for depressive disorders in yourself, or someone close to you: We don't require a formal diagnosis, but even if you are diagnosed you need to stay strictly on topic. Depression is both hard and important to talk about, so we're tightly focused on the illness itself.

No general questions or observations (i.e. "Showerthoughts"). Nothing that's mainly a social issue. No pop culture. 

See r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression for detailed guidance and alternatives.   

If your main issue is suicidal thoughts or feelings, please visit /r/SuicideWatch instead.

All replies must be empathetic and responsive to OP. No tough love or debate.: No abuse or “tough love” of any kind. Do not confront or debate.

If your comment could apply to many of our OPs, don't post it. Don't fob people off on hotlines. 

No one-upping ("I have it worse") or piling on ("same"/"me too"). If you're looking for support, we hope you'll make your own thread or use the check-in thread, but please don't hijack someone else's post.

For evidence-based guidance on what TO say, see r/depression/wiki/giving_help for guidance.

Offer help ONLY via public comments.  No "I'm here to help"  posts or PM/chat requests: Here-to-help posts are hurtful to OPs awaiting quality, supportive responses. Making one shows that you don't know what you're doing. **Effective helpers must be self-aware enough to be selective about whom they engage with and offer individualised responses.**  

Never invite private or offsite contact until rapport is well established. OPs aren't forbidden from requesting PMs, but we advise against it.  See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact for a full explanation of this policy.

No low-content posts or responses: Posts must include enough information for the community to offer meaningful support.  Replies must demonstrate understanding or ask question to gain understanding. Do not just agree or disagree.

Don't role-model or put yourself above others.  No achievement/advice posts or AMAs: We know some people find "success stories" helpful but many others find them painful and demoralising, and experience them as empty virtue-signalling.  "Inspiration porn" is just as toxic and ableist in a mental-health context as any other. This kind of content is all too easy to find online if that's what you want, but this is a place to escape it.

For this reason, we specifically allow no AMAs of any kind.  

You may post personal achievements in the check-in threads.

No general uplifting content of any kind, including "it gets better" or other unkeepable promises: Nothing "uplifting", "encouraging", or "inspiring"; this usually backfires.  

Avoid promises or assurances about the OP and their situation that you can't guarantee, e.g. "it gets better", "you're a strong person".  It encourages [an unhealthy outcome-based mindset](http://www.ted.com/talks/srikumar_rao_plug_into_your_hard_wired_happiness).

Instead, [contribute good examples of empathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw), which will help everyone, not just the OP you're replying to.

Do not give or request clinical advice or advocate for or against treatments &amp; self-help strategies: Understanding is usually more helpful than solutions. 

Do not diagnose or prescribe treatments or self-help ***including religion***, even casually, even if OP requests it.  Don't give or request clinical advice.

It's fine to share your experience *upon request*, but **de**scribe, Don't **pre**scribe.

Medication-specific content belongs in /r/antidepressants, not here. 

Don't call out support tactics you dislike.  Chances are they're already against the rules.  If not, message the mods.

NO methods for any type of self-harm, or validating self-destructive intent: It's absolutely forbidden to in any way incite or validate self-harm, including suicide.

You may not provide information on suicide methods even if an OP specifically requests it.

We allow a little latitude in the case of OPs expressing their emotions through imagery, but none for anyone acting as a helper.  

/r/SuicideWatch has a [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement) with more information

Don't encourage rule-breaking or off-topic content: Please don't in any way encourage or validate rule-breaking content.  Common examples:

* Encouraging people who make "achievement" or "here to help" posts

* Making posts that require people to break the community rules, e.g. asking about self-harm methods or asking for clinical advice

* Normalising self-harming or suicidal behaviour or intent. Do not post methods information even if requested. 

* Engaging with posts that appear to be off-topic instead of clarifying or redirecting

No activism, debate or unapproved surveys including casual or general questions and polls: We know activism (fundraising, awareness-raising, etc.) and debate are essential, but they don't work in a support space. This kind of content can be distressing to our vulnerable population, and shifts focus away from personal support.  

We permit a few research-related survey requests after a vetting and identity verification process.  These have "Mod Approved" flair.  No other surveys are allowed.  DAE style questions may be asked ONLY in the regular check-in threads.

Absolutely no self-promotion of any kind, including creative writing or other arts: If you want to advertise, [pay for it](https://advertising.reddithelp.com/).  

We understand that creative pursuits are a useful form of self-help for many.  But please discuss them or share your output in one of the creative arts subs rather than here.

Do not request or offer money, goods, or services: This is a support space.  Almost anyone who ignores our stated purpose and asks for money here is almost certainly a scammer.  Please report and do not engage.

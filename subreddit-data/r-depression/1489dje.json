    "postText": "Hey. I have a deep draining feeling inside me since i had high functioning Depression 10 years ago. It was triggered by panic episodes i became through extreme hypochondria and i literally thought for atleast a year that i was going to die. After that a cycle started of depressive episodes and now i regret what happened because i havent been the same since. I was such a positive person before this event even tho i was not loved, manipulated and abused at home. Now i lost my Jobs, had a pension, am alone with my thoughts in my room. I dont see myself getting up it is to draining.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m still in survival mode despite trying my best to get out of this rut. I failed my math finals, have a 1.5 GPA as a junior, and have essentially burned all the bridges of any dreams I had when I was younger. All I do is sleep (chronically ill too) or play Animal Crossing to help with the perpetual misery and distract me from how pathetic my existence is. It\u2019s the end of the year and I hear about how all my friends are maintaining these wonderful grades and belittling everyone below a 2.0 when little do they know I\u2019m one of them. My dad doesn\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t just push through anymore. I don\u2019t either, and it frustrates me to an upmost extent. I\u2019d rather be dead than live a pointless life, I don\u2019t bring any worth into this world.",

    "postText": "Im 17 now and up to this year everything that happen before now has simply faded. I have no recognition or memory of the good or bad that happened all I rember is I was alone and I would subconsciously attempt to find someone to fill a hole inside me that only I could and it would end up hurting me more. My friends and family always ask.me if I remember this or that from back when but I can never seem to. I've lost so many good memories at the price of not having to remember the bad. I've read some articles over time and talked to some people and I've come to realize that it is not normal as I had previously thought and that it was a coping mechanism for my brian due to the trauma of the past. I don't believe I have fully processed anything that has happened really as I cannot remember any of it and even when I try my hardest to think back to it my brian subconscious changes the topic or just doesn't bring up any emotion from back then. I need to move on as this forgetting my memory thing really is affecting my school work but I dont know what to do.",

    "postText": "I'm asking because I've had diagnosed depression since around 10 years old. This means that (because meds haven't cured it) all I've ever known is almost crippling depression. Sooo as you can imagine I can't imagine feeling anything but depressed and hearing the word depression thrown around SO MUCH, and it kinda sucks when people don't have it but think they experienced it at one point because they were extra sad or something. Because of that discovery that not everyone that says they're depressed is always genuine (especially online), I was wondering, does anyone have an estimate of the % of people that are actually genuine and suffering?",

For those who joke about depression, it\u2019s normally a coping mechanism so that have anything on the planet to make them laugh even a little bit just because nothing else will. The laughter is often forced. Depression is a silent killer and people everyday are trying to escape it. Depression isn\u2019t curable, but it is cope-able (by force really) because if you don\u2019t find a way to cope with it, it can and will end you.  So yes, a lot of people suffer, but we never really know how much unless they\u2019re descriptively vocal about it, tbh.",

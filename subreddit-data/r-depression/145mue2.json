    "postText": "I'm sorry this is going to be long but I really need to say what I never got to say just because I was ashamed and I feel like I'm not legit. And sorry if there are grammar mistakes I used Google translate. I don't know if it's important but I'm a girl and I'm 16\n\nWhen I was 12 I tried to kill myself and I had no reason to want to die. everything was pretty much going well in my life today I still don't understand why I wanted to die and if I really wanted to die.\nThe only things wrong with my life was that I had no confidence in myself at all, I've always been fat and ugly and sometimes I was laughed at for it but it wasn't often, I 've always been lonely since I was little I didn't interact much with others, I was not very well integrated and put aside. But I had a few friends and I was hanging out with a group of girls in which I felt quite alone, they hardly spoke to me but it was also my fault because I had trouble imposing myself in discussions but above all I was weird there were days when I didn't speak and others when I spoke too much, they almost all knew that I was often deprimed and that I scarified myself I understand that people find that repulsive.\nI was terrified every day before going to college even though I often had pretty good days. (I know it's quite contradictory but it's true) (and for the scarifications, I don't know why I scarified myself either, and if everyone knew it it was because a friend had discovered it and she I had said to everyone)) that was about the only things that were wrong in my life and honestly I don't think that justified my desire to die.\n\nAfter trying to end my life I was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital I stayed there for 1 month, I lived it quite badly. I didn't see my family very much, I was often alone and always tired from the medication. But above all the psychologists thought that I was lying about the reasons for my suicide attempt, I had told them that I didn't know why I had done that and they had told my mother that I was hiding things from them. I think that's why I no longer dared confide in psychologists, I didn't want to be called a liar. And when they let me out of the hospital, the doctors told my mother that I would go back to the hospital and they were right.\n\nwhen I was 13 I tried to kill myself again (I still don't know why) (in the meantime I had to see psychologists several times a week and I was diagnosed with depression, social and school phobia)) I was hospitalized again even though I had begged my mother not to accept the hospitalization because she knew very well that it had not helped me at all and that it was hard for me but she ignored it.\nLike the first time, I was alone, the doctors don't let me see my family much, I spent Christmas in the hospital and I had to beg them crying to agree to let me spend New Year's with my family it was humiliating. They stuffed me with so many anxiolytics that I slept all day I was a zombie. after more than a month I left the hospital, I continued to see psychologists.\n\nBut little by little I stopped seeing them, I stopped going to college, I lost the only friends I had left, I stopped taking my medicine and I started to sink in my depression, I no longer did anything, I no longer saw anyone, I no longer went out, I've gained a lot of weight, I lost interest in everything. And here I am, 4 years later. Nothing got better, everything got worse and now at least I have reason to want to die but I don't want to die. \nDuring all this time I lived through my depression, it is no longer me who thinks but her. I have no life plans, my mother puts pressure on me to find a job because as I no longer go to school we have problems with the law so as for me it is impossible to return to school so I have to work but that too is impossible for me.\nNo one understands me I would never be able to find a job I'm so afraid of the outside world, afraid of others, afraid of life. I can't get out of my room, even to go shopping with my mother, I can't. I'm getting nowhere, I don't know what to do. How could I have wasted my life in such a short time, and damn how is it possible to be depressed and have tried to kill myself for no reason how is it possible. I think the worst thing is not knowing why I'm like this. I think I have mental problems I don't know what I have, why I'm like this. Holy shit I'm so scared, I want to disappear.",

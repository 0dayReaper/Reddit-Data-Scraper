    "postText": "I just need to get this off my chest. I (15M) did just barely stop me from cutting me for the first time. I\u2019ve never done it, always thought it was weird and attention seeking and why anyone would ever do it. But here I am. In the last couple of months It has gotten more and more attractive and idk how long I can resist, as stupid as it sounds. I literally already moved to the closet\u2026 \n\nIdk what to do anymore\n\nIdk if i can do anything anymore\n\nAnd please don\u2019t tell me to tell anyone or to get therapy\n\nI know that I should but I am just to terrified after my last therapist",

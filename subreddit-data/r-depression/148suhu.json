I\u2019m getting written up at work for calling in last week when I was too depressed to get out of bed. My employer is making my life a living hell over it, making things harder for me and ignoring me, talking about me to the other employees. Deciding to text me after I had left just to ruin my night. \n\nI lost it and yelled at my family, took it out physically on myself. I feel so guilty for yelling at them and I know I\u2019m a disgusting piece of trash but I\u2019m stuck here",

But I have this memory of hearing a voice saying over and over, \"you're not supposed to be here\" and it echoes in my head all the time.  How many of you absolutely hate where you are geographically?  Hate your country?  Know you're supposed to be somewhere else?  My physical location contributes SO much to my depression and I have to get out before this place kills me. ",

    "postText": "Spent weeks working on a project with someone and I was really looking forward to having it all come together in the end and be something we did together.  But instead the day before it would be finished I get shafted and on of their other friends will take my place.  I wasn't asking for much, I just wanted something to look forward to doing and being able to finally finish something i put a ton of work into.  But can't be surprised when I act like such a depressed piece of shit that they wouldn't want me to be involved anymore.  Can't blame them really, this shit has done nothing but sap everything out of me and made me a chore to be around.  I'm just so tired of trying things to get myself out and it always falls apart and I always end in the same place.  It's ruining every aspect of my life and all I can do is watch it happen and pretend everything is fine.  Why does this shit have to hurt so much?",

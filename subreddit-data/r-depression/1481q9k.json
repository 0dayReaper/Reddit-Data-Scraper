    "postText": "I am trying my damnedest to be a functioning human, but my roommate is really trying their best to make my life miserable.\n\nI am trying to move and only recently have reached the financial stability to go out on my own. Shortly after our lease was signed, it became clear that my roommate felt they deserved more pull in household decisions despite us splitting costs evenly. There were a few months where things worked and then they didn't, in a big way. So it's been a little over a year of me barely leaving my room and basically making myself as nonexistent as possible. Now I'm finally at the point of trying to find a new apartment, and I've hit a big snag. All communication with the landlord (basically nothing, just the monthly \"hey, rent's ready\") has went through my roommate and despite asking a few times in the past (when we actually spoke to each other), I was never given the phone number. And eventually I was at the point of just trying to survive and disappear from sight and really didn't think about it. Now I need rental references and my roommate is refusing to give me the phone number, even though they want me out and this inhibits my ability to do so. I don't know what to do and I'm really coming down on a time crunch. I'm trying not to go off the deep end, but having someone hate me so much for no apparent reason is really making me want to be done with it all. Ngl it's crossed my mind to do it here and hopefully haunt the place.",

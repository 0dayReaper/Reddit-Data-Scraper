    "postText": "I feel more comfortable when I'm so overwhelmed by emotions that I can't do anything. I feel at my best when I'm at my worst if that makes sense. I always want to suffer, when things start to go well theres always a nagging thought in the back of my head wondering when I'll break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't help being with other people. Being a downer all the time is annoying, especially if you're trying to help that person, so I've ended up pushing away a lot of people by opening up. Not being able to open up to people makes me feel hollow, like theres something just gone. It's probably bad to always want people to care about you and pay attention to you, but its something I can't shake.",

    "postText": "On a very unfortunate day in 1997, a child was born. Things were pretty much normal except for the fact that his family was struggling hard to survive and to have something to eat each day. They used to make paper bags every day and sell them for their survival. Now, during this tough time, he came into this world. People were hopeful that someday the new-born would grow up and save them from this misfortune.\n\nThey encouraged this kid to gather knowledge, as knowledge and a good education could be the way to salvation. The kid gradually fell in love with studying and did well in the board examinations. The kid was able to secure distinctions in various examinations and used to be a good artist as well.\n\nBut the journey was not easy, as his father used to be an idle, careless man who used to abuse him mentally nearly every day for 10 years. He received no help in any form from his father, and sometimes he used to get beaten for lame reasons, such as poor handwriting. His father was reluctant to pay for his studies and did not save a single penny for his future. When the kid grew up to become a teenager, he protested his desire to become a doctor and, as a result, was thrown out of his father's house as he did not want to spend money on him.\n\nWith help from some of his close relatives, this kid became a doctor. Luckily, this was not like his father. He could sense the disparity among poor strata and wanted to study a bit more to be a specialist and dedicate his life to the needy. But the old incidents haunt him each day. His father has remained the same. He is now literally begging everyone to help him.\n\nI don't know how much longer he would be able to stay alive, as he is already dead inside. He remains silent all the time; his head feels heavy and extremely painful; he does not have the courage to carry this human-shaped cage anymore; he cries daily at night; and he remains depressed all the time. He only has one question remaining to ask the world. Is this how humanity, the greatest pride of the greatest creature ever created, is supposed to work?",

            "comment": "i used to live my life trying to make my father pride, didnt manage to be great, just a \"meh\" person. my father used to say i was useless.. after talking to various phisicians, doctors, psichologists, psyquiatry, they all say the same thing. Does it really matter what your father thinks? can you change him? are you willing to waste your life just because other people say you are useless?  the answer is always the same, of course not, but deep inside i feel like this, like a computer programed to feel always this way.. why do we give so much tought to what other people says of us? why do we allow to be feeling this way. i see people around me happy, are those like a mask like the one i put on every day or are they just that confident? why people like to make others miserable? i dont wish to be rich, dont wish to be sucessfull, just trying to make my wife happy while she tries her best to make me happy.",

I can do the later one easily and do that every day, but to do the first one, in this materialistic world, you need money most of the time. I don't have much, nor does my family. I have tried to persuade many people to help me but have failed at every point.",

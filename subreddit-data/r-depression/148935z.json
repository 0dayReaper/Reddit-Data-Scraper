I\u2019m a young adult and that\u2019s not something I want to do, but I\u2019m so stuck in my depression it\u2019s hard to avoid. \n\nMy problem is I AM lonely and I DO feel like I\u2019m the only one who is going through this. I feel so cringe even thinking this, but it does feel like no one else gets me. Although I feel this way I know it\u2019s not true and that many people are going through a tough time just like me if not worse. \n\nI recently came off my antidepressants cold turkey and am finally starting to feel the downfall. The withdrawals were unpleasant, but manageable and didn\u2019t last long. There was an point where things were looking up then things went downhill, mostly out of nowhere. I just wanted to share my experience.",

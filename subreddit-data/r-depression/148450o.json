    "postText": "I've been okay for the past few months but today is not good.  I was dating this girl, whom also has depression, and I feel like I could sense when she was feeling down.  She broke up w me yesterday, said she doesn't have love feeling for me, although her actions showed otherwise.  Part of me wante to believe she is pushing me away cuz her depression is getting to her, she has done that before.  Either way, why am I never good enough.  I'm told I'm a handsome guy so is my personality that bad?  I miss the feeling of feeling okay....",

You are enough! Don't let one person dictate your worth when you have so much to give to other people and yourself in the future. Good luck my friend.",

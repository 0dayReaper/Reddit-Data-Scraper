    "postText": "Depression is like a cancer of the soul it eats everything you liked loved or cared about till it has just you Left. And a constant reminder of what it has taken. Im not young, I'm not particularly going through just a rough time. This has been a ongoing thing for 30 plus years. Sure I've fought it for a period of time through help with medication. But I stopped that. Can't stand the way I feel on it no dreams just middle ground. Not happy not really sad. Just one level. When I don't take anything it's mostly bad days and really bad days. I think at this point I rather feel like this.sure I'm probably getting fired from my job soon because I can't no longer perform. I don't Nessaarly Care. I don't want anything I have no desire for relationship... After this last one I'm officially DONE. I helped her so much with rides when she didn't have a car with $$$ and where is she lol.. I could die she hasn't reached out in 6 months. Oh well. That's for the best too. Can't stand the thought of getting older and getting another disease alone and dying. I honestly can't do it. I need to have a choice when I go. Not some thing doing it for me. I gave up all my hobbies and interests. I have absolutely nothing I desire or care about any More. I think it was all a sham anyway. I don't expect any comments on this Post. I constantly wonder what it would of been like to live without this. how happy dome people seem. Normal. That's all I ever wanted was to be normal. But it was not in the cards for me I guess. I just wish I had a mom or family to talk to",

I try weird(to the culture you're typically accustomed to) ethnic foods and sample new media that is outside my usual tastes. Try some video games. Get a dog if money and time permits.  Take pills a stranger gave you n the playground. Liberate a giraffe from the local zoo. Give the giraffe a cowboy hat. Ride said giraffe into the sunset while attempting to yodel. Wake up in a pool of your own sweat and realize you'll cowardly continue your routine into oblivion and the only change will be that you'll slower mentally and physically until you retire for a scant few years before you hit the wall of the average life expectancy.",

Sorry this isn't regular depression. I work 65 hrs a week the dog will not be good alone. I am older I've tried those things when I was younger. Like I said I tried not like I didn't. Your talking like I'll be around for retirement lol",

    "postText": "I lost my insurance about a month ago after being laid off 3 months ago and choosing not to go the COBRA route. Due to my depression about the layoff and a few other serious family emergencies including deaths, I just haven\u2019t bothered yet to sign up for marketplace insurance and weaned off all my meds approx 6-8 weeks ago knowing the end of my coverage was on the horizon. I have bipolar, anxiety, and ADHD for reference.\n\nAnd (despite grief about my family situations) I feel\u2026fine? Like, legitimately stable? I don\u2019t mean manic fine or between episodes fine, and nearing 30 dealing with this illness for a decade I think I can tell the difference by now. I was on 6 major meds (latuda, wellbutrin, klonopin, propranolol, adderall, and lamictal) and thought I\u2019d have support needs for the rest of my life. Now I only pop a klonopin for panic and take birth control. I\u2019ve gained a bunch of weight but honestly I couldn\u2019t give less of a fuck about my body and physical appearance next to the scope of how bad my mental health was. I feel clear headed. I\u2019ve been reading novels, for example\u2014something I haven\u2019t been able to do since before college for lack of attention and lack of interest in enjoyable things, even whilst medicated. I\u2019m able to enjoy things and feel just generally interested in life. I\u2019m developing dreams about places I want to travel and starting to think about if this is a good time to make a career pivot and what that\u2019d entail. I don\u2019t feel *too* energized though and can still sleep till noon sometimes and recognize when I feel \u201cnormal sad\u201d about my woes, but it\u2019s not the same feeling as suicidal depression sad. As I mentioned before, there\u2019s \u201cdepression\u201d I guess, and yeah it\u2019s led to some procrastination and blues, but it\u2019s not like capital D Depression.\n\nNow I\u2019m just sitting here wondering if I\u2019m even sick, if I\u2019m for the time being better, or if I just got lucky to be in a plateau of normalcy and things are going to come crashing down imminently. I almost feel imposter syndrome about being unwell. I always thought I was VERY unwell, and now I\u2019m taking a step back and wondering how much (if any) of that was self-fulfilling/psychosomatic. Or, if being involuntarily unemployed for 3 months has just remedied my burnout and healed a part of me that capitalism stole. Really at a loss for what to do.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m extremely self destructive. I know smoking weed kinda makes my meds stop working. But I can\u2019t stop and don\u2019t want to. I know retreating inward and being away from people always backfires but I just can\u2019t stand it. I have a new job that pays pretty great, but I feel trapped and I already wish I was doing something else. Which I hate because I feel like a lazy whiny person who takes everything that is good\u2026 and destroys it. Im overwhelmed and I\u2019ve been self harming again\u2026 and I know im the problem in my life. I make it worse. God sorry for the rant but this is just how I \nfeel",

    "postText": "(idk if this is the correct location to put this at so forgive me)  \nI'm currently a high school junior (16), and I've been suffering from symptoms of depression since around 11 years old. I've then been properly diagnosed with it at approx 14. Since then my school life had been absolute shit, prior before I experienced symptoms I had been on honors rolls, getting upset with myself over getting the bare minimum to pass school. But now I do focus on that because I legit can't fucking do enough about it. At least 5 times a day whether if its on the weekends or afterschool, I had found myself sitting in bed all day because that's where I find the most comfort at. Mental health has always been prevelant in my Mom's family who was diagnosed with depresison herself at 13 years old, and she really seems like the only one who understands. I have a therapist however I increasingly gotten embarrassed with myself, so a lot of my sessions are dragged every other week rather than every week (or sometimes twice a week) then how it used to be. I have regents coming up because I live in New York, and I've been beating my ass for the entire of the month since it started. I've lost weight from not eating enough, I don't shower all because of a fucking school. In my freshmen year I severely relapsed which prompted for me to self harm for the first time, and in May I had to be hospitalized because I made the big ass mistake of telling my school guidance counselor I was suicidal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fucking hate every teacher in my school, I envy the students there who have stable friends and grades while I sit in the back rotting to shit. Even as the summer comes up I'm not looking foward to that because of the fucked up events at my home. Sophomore year my Dad admitted to cheating on my Mom the entirety of their relationship. She cries everyday and I try to ask her to do counseling with me but she never wants to. I don't trust my Dad, I don't trust men. Every men I've had in my life were the scummiest pieces of shits from my own Dad to my older brother's Dad, who's just as bad. Everyday since June I've been on the verge of suicide because of all of this, and I wish I had the fucking cojones to come up and say how I feel. Even my next counseling session is two days from now, and I feel as though I wouldn't be able to say everything I feel, writing down is the only thing that works for me now.",

            "comment": "Writing things down is a good start. Besides venting on reddit, you can try keeping a journal for more private things you might not want to share publicly. Writing things down, even if others don't see them, can really help to provide some psychological relief.\n\nI'm sorry your home life is so damaging. It sounds like you need more supports, in addition to your therapist. I wonder if there are extended family members you can lean on, or school counselors you can continue to use, or if you can find peer support groups or hotlines for teens wherever it is you live in NY. This is probably the most important thing to help you get through this rough patch.\n\nIt's not a mistake to tell a counselor or therapist that you're suicidal, if you really are. Hospitalization is horrible but if it kept you safe in spite of all the negatives, it was worth it. \n\nYou've probably heard this and hate hearing it, but it's not hopeless. I grew up in an abusive household and things felt hopeless to me too, but they weren't. You're young and your world is going to get bigger after high school. Find ways to survive for now, and most importantly, surround yourself with human beings who can help in various ways.\n\nGood luck friend!",

            "comment": "Good news is school isn't everything. You've been in that system for pretty much your whole life up to this point, so it can feel bad when it seems like it's not motivating you or going well. The bad news is life after school is a big free-for-all. It becomes difficult to find systems where you have access to so many people so easily. But then you might get into a work system or church or whatever and it kind of operates the same. \n\nSchool isn't for everyone, and it's not a judgment of who you are and what you can be. It's a catalyst for the next stage in your life, and you get to figure out what that is at some point.",

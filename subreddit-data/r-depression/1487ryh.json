I normally cannot stop crying on my own and alcohol hekps with that. As I am typing to you right now. I am also drunk. Thank God for auto correct. But I really want to know how I can manage my emotions better with out drinking. I tried working out, I tried reading, I\u2019m stuck. I don\u2019t wanna be an alcoholic but I\u2019m afraid I am already one.",

    "postText": "I'm not depressed, but I've been cutting for some time now. It managed to go unnoticed until recently. My parents found out I've been cutting after I randomly decided to burst into tears but they're not saying a single word about it. Their initial reaction was disappointment and disbelief and that they were making me see a psychologist, but they were busy at that time so no actual conversation took place. I was mentally preparing for a confrontation, but they never did bring it up. I can't tell if they're angry at me or think I'm being over dramatic. I don't care about whether they're going to help me or not because I don't want it, but I'm afraid that they'll catch me off guard and suddenly talk about it and potentially disown me. Really afraid.",

            "comment": "My dad did the same thing. He caught me off guard years ago and he started crying. Didn\u2019t say anything when he found out and he didn\u2019t bring it up for a while. When he decided to talk about it, he was talking about how he failed me and he should\u2019ve been there for me. I think your parents might be going through the same thing. They love you and they are probably looking for things they could\u2019ve done better or how could they have not known you were doing it. No parent wants to see their child like that. You may not be depressed but you should still be open with your therapist with the reason for cutting yourself. Wishing you the best of luck with your parents and I hope you treat + love yourself better.",

    "postText": "I think I have a weakened immune system. I\u2019ve been sick 6 times this year and I\u2019ve missed weeks of work which I feel so guilty about. I also miss out on life and quality time with my boyfriend who has to put up with my frequent illnesses. \n\nI feel like a weakling, a failure and a total slug. I can\u2019t lose weight because I\u2019m constantly sick, and I can\u2019t diet either. I try to eat healthy and get good sleeps because I know if i have one bad sleep I\u2019ll get sick. If I drink, I\u2019ll get sick. If someone is sick around me, I\u2019ll get sick too. I live in fear, anticipating the next time I\u2019ll get sick. \n\nI just had bronchitis and missed a week of work. I finally got better enough to go for one bike ride (still a bit of a cough but otherwise better). That bike ride was on Wednesday, and on Friday I started feeling unwell again. Today, Saturday, I tested positive for Covid and I have a fever and I\u2019m delirious. \n\nI just wanted to go outside this weekend. For a walk even. I want to wear nice clothes and put on makeup and feel pretty. But instead I\u2019m dreading calling into work again, fearing for my job security, and I can\u2019t do anything but lay here and cough and whimper, wondering if I\u2019ll ever get to live my life. \n\nI had extensive bloodwork done recently and it all came back normal. There\u2019s no known cause for why I get sick constantly. But it makes me so depressed. I\u2019m missing out on my life. I worry my boyfriend will resent me for being a constant burden and not being able to do fun things together..",

If that's the case there could be another underlying health issues and I think you should seek professional help. Talk to your doctor or your local gp and they should be able to refer you to somewhere. Then you can get your life back on track and enjoy things without having to worry about getting sick",

    "postText": "i mean, i have a boyfriend who i love, but i feel like (due to me having borderline personality disorder) with my rapidly changing emotional state and constant bouts of suicidal ideation i\u2019m hurting him far more than i\u2019m helping him. he\u2019s hanging out with his friends tonight for the first time in maybe a year and a half (if not two years) and of course i go and fuck with his night by saying that i feel like shit and i feel like i\u2019m just purposefully ruining good things for him. my family is constantly disappointed with the direction i\u2019m going in life, i don\u2019t think i\u2019ll ever do right by them. i can\u2019t get through a single day without being high or drunk enough to the point that i can\u2019t think. i really really can\u2019t see a point anymore. i think i\u2019d limit pain for everyone else and myself if i just made a plan and stuck to it. and that terrifies me because i know i\u2019m not strong enough to do it myself, only strong enough to put myself in situations in which i could die. and that makes me want to kill myself even more because i\u2019m such a fucking coward. my thoughts are on a constant spiral and they never stop.",

Thus them knowing my sadness they tend to avoid me, i guess, because the world views that being sad is a bad thing (expect in movies, apparently). As human nature has it we try to avoid bad things or give more negative connotation to it. Understanding this I ask myself how can I ask someone to fill my own selfish desire to be hugged knowing they will get nothing in return. Thats a one sided deal. I hate myself for being this selfish/realist/sad/{negative thoughts about myself} person. It is truly hard for wanting someone to be there. Stay optimistic, little optimistic me says you will find someone.",

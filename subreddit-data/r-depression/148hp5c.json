But I also feel like I would\u2019ve been dead already if I wasn\u2019t such a coward. I just wish I had the willpower to just end it but I don\u2019t. \n\nEvery time I think about committing my brain always thinks what if this doesn\u2019t work? What if I end up surviving? I don\u2019t want that I wish there was a way to end all of this.",

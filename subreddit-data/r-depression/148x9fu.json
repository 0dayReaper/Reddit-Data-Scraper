    "postText": "Hi, it's my first post anywhere. I have noticed that when talking about having depression, suicidal thoughts, etc, a lot of people (myself included) use very poetic and artsy language. Do you guys see it as well? \nI saw a great video on that by oliSUNvia on YouTube and it really made me think about how I express and process my feelings, but I still do it like I'm writing a poem or something.\nPart of me feels like it's normal but maybe it really is fetishizing my mental health issues.\nAn example of that is seeing the difference between the way I vent to people online and irl, and how much more \"poetic\" it seems when I'm texting.\nAnd sometimes I even think this way. Like, I'll make up a sentence in my head that sounds cool or deep. I don't know why I do it, it just happens.\n Also most of the time, that sentence is in english, wich is weird bc I'm not a native speaker. Maybe it's bc most of the content I've consumed regarding these subjects was in english, idk.\nAnyways, sorry for my English if it's confusing at some point and I really wanna hear some opinions on this. Bye bye",

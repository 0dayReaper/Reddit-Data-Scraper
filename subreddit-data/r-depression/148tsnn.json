    "postText": "I find it very hard to cry, only doing it rarely when I dip too far, and NEED to let something out. Even then, I wait until I am completely alone and closeted, as to not let anyone know. This time though was different. This dip I feel broke the dam, because I\u2019ve cried at least once every day this week and I don\u2019t think it will stop. I almost cried at work more than once around all my coworkers and had to hold myself back to not look stupid. I don\u2019t even know what I crying about at this point anymore. I just want this pain in my heart to stop.",

I felt like maybe I could finally look for some help after all these years, but I was just too short, so I\u2019m sitting here on the floor crying. I know they aren\u2019t closed forever and I can just try again tomorrow, but this just added another crack to the dam for now.",

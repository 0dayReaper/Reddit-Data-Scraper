    "postText": "Like you've read on the title I got my feet back up, which I think is a good thing honestly but sometimes randomly throughout the day my mind kept telling me to jump off the building or slit my throat. Some context is need of course so way back at April there's some heartfelt thing happened between me and my friend so I was glad that someone cared for me and all of that afterwards it all became better and I got a job! \n\n\n           These things happened were good but there's still a chance that I might kill myself if ever I let these thoughts control me. Mind I say before these good events happened everyday was like a constant fucking battle of routinely wasting my time into oblivion and you can guess how my mind worked in that time. So, my main point in this post is, I don't think I can remove this thoughts but I think I can make appear less until maybe it won't appear again. What do you think?\n\n\nTldr; Good shit happened, Bad thoughts still there might off myself if I let it be. Don't think these thoughts are gonna be over soon.",

    "postText": "So to preface, I am a grow, married, and self sufficient almost 31 year old. (birthday next month) I feel like my mom (her whole family honestly) only cares about me if I\u2019m actually physically available, and even then still have picked on me for my entire life as well as don\u2019t even call me by my new legal name which I find incredibly disrespectful\u2026 but I digress. I\u2019m also adopted. I live almost an hour away with my partner and I have a full time job with overtime. \n\nI guess the gist is, I honestly don\u2019t want to have to go around and I\u2019m being volunteered to drive over 200 miles one way next weekend in my vehicle or my partner\u2019s vehicle. This will all be after a full week of working and training for a new position I litterally JUST found out that I got this morning. Small victories I guess\u2026 but they don\u2019t seem to care to even care that i bust my ass to survive let alone finally get the job I originally wanted. I get called \u201centitled millennial\u201d or \u201cheadcase cunt\u201d when I need time to decompress. Why would I want to be stuck on a road trip dealing with that?! Most importantly why do I still have to deal with this mess of being treated like an idiot or a useless child as an adult?! Does that ever stop or am I just expected to deal with the shit treatment because \u201cthey are family\u201d?!",

But not in a mean way, just let them go... \n\nShould they try to contact you, tell them all of your concerns, and if they do not submit to that, and then ghost them forever.\n\nYou should get a honest apology from each of them who have hurt you, and do not settle for less. I'm truly sorry for your experience!",

I\u2019m pretty close to doing so again,but instead I\u2019m deciding to go to a longer therapy session on Friday and be an adult an out the situation no matter how difficult that is at current. I\u2019m pretty much at the point of knowing I\u2019m going to always be the black sheep of the family, but I don\u2019t respect the treatment. I\u2019m an introvert and I\u2019m tbh fine going long times without their contact if it breed a better piece of mind for myself.",

I\u2019m especially now that they\u2019re showing their true colors even more because they realize I won\u2019t let them have control going on with prioritizing them over my adoptive family.",

Trying to be an adult about it, may even make it all worse - esp. in my experience.",

    "postText": "So around this time I've basically finished school in it's entirety and I've got about 4 days of exams left. I feel upset and alone because none of my friends are going to the same college I am which is made worse by the fact that I don't really know how to make friends anymore or to hold a conversation.\nFor about 6-7 years I've been severely depressed and the only thing that was keeping me going was my friends but now they've all stopped caring completely and I feel completely and utterly alone.",

    "postText": "Yep I\u2019m that stereotypical loner with 2 cats. My parents call them their \u201cgrand-kitties\u201d which is so degrading to me it honestly makes me feel ashamed for having cats. On top of that taking care of them is starting to be more and more exhausting. They\u2019re still kittens so they\u2019re always full of energy. The first one i picked out myself but the other was kind of forced on me. I was told if I didn\u2019t take him he would be euthanized. Taking care of them is becoming completely exhausting I cant even think of dealing with them for 10-12 years or however long they have left.   BUT , I know without a doubt if I give them away I will regret it. I know it. I try my hardest to care for them I really do, and sometimes they\u2019re just delightful. But a lot of times they make me break shit out of frustration . I can\u2019t get rid of them, there\u2019s no one in my life I trust enough to take care of them, but I dont have the energy anymore to commit to them so I dont know what to do. They\u2019re not the cause of my depression thats been goin on for most of my life. But if I dont get better and decide to end it, I\u2019ll probably take them with me. Im just cant imagine the possibility of them going to an abusive owner.",

            "comment": "Grand-kitties is kinda of cute, but I understand why you feel otherwise.\n\nAt least you have 2 cats and loving parents. I've got absolutely nothing! Not sure if I want to switch places though, no offence. But things are subjective. So if you had a loving partner and a dog, or a bunny, or some birds or something, I might reconsider.\n\nThat the kitten was \"forced\" on you, is a tell sign that you are not listening to or respecting your feelings. \n\nI know the world is completely f'ed up, but you also need to take care of yourself, all right? Otherwise, you can't take care of kittens, like you're beginning to experience right now. Don't worry though - cats become very individualistic over time. And how you're feeling atm will go over.\n\nSo if you feel that someone comes with a great idea, and that unless you follow it, everything will go to hell - then tell them politely to stfu.\n\nMaybe you could ask for some help in taking care of them? And when you have this free time, take care of yourself by doing something that would make you feel good about yourself, not in self-loathing like watching Netflix, but either by contributing in a way you feel comfortable with or developing a skill you enjoy, or experience something you feel is missing in your life. \n\nWin-win! People help you because they care about you, and you will also care for yourself. People are nice, and you are human. They are human, and you are nice. Just keep that in mind, and be diligent and patient. It will be a good experience for you!\n\nStart small, but plan it ahead in terms of what could go wrong and what you should do in case. Recognize your needs, and start building a routine around that. Can't get a partner right now? Get a friend. Can't get a friend? Get a buddy. Can't get a buddy? Talk to some homeless people... Feeling lonely is not only about filling it with people. Sometimes it's a lack of purpose. Sometimes it's about being comfortable by your self. Sometimes it's a lack of variation.\n\nIdeally there should be a place for people and animals who are left out of society, where they would not be euthanized or shamed into depression, but would work together on a farm with sunshine and flowers, and spend time helping each other and being happy together. \n\nWhile all the other people are busy \"contributing\" to society, by contributing to themselves and developing medicine to keep people from expressing their suffering - because that's no fun to listen to...\n\nBut I think that place only exist in my thoughts sadly...\n\nKeep your chin up, and do your best!",

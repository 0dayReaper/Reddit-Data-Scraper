    "postText": "Ive been depressed for most of my life (genetics apparently? My parents both have some sort of depressive disorder) so I always have been moderately affected by it (more or less, I really started to do bad after I got my puberty) been taking Zoloft for about 1 and a half years now and just now I cannot get myself to do art anymore, I used to do it constantly I own tons of supplies , an expensive screen tablet but nothing makes me want to draw and If i try it doesnt turn into anything I like looking at\nI dont want to turn to another hobby, I love creating and I love drawing but right now its dragging me down and I have no idea why, it happened so suddenly (beginning of 2023 to now) I have no Idea, I jzst want to complain",

    "postText": "Earlier today, I got annoyed that I had to sit in the middle seat, so I said to my mom (out of earshot of everyone else) \"this sucks\". Hours later, she bought it up, and even though she was right to criticize me, I was really upset. She was being harsh with her criticism, yes, but she wasn't being cruel. But it put me in a bad mood. I spent the next hour hating myself, wishing I could go back in time and change it. I couldn't smile much.",

It is fine if you don\u2019t like spending time with ours. We live in a world where everyone is a human, and all have their own wishes. Nobody lives in lone caves. We should try to accommodate. Pardon but it is what i think. \n\nWhen you say you are antisocial, do you mean that you hate others or you just don\u2019t want to have time with them ?",

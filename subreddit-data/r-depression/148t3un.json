    "postText": "For the past two years I've noticed that after struggling with depression for many years without getting proper help, I started to wonder what's wrong with me . I keep sabotaging my relationships and my life. I have recently broken up w my now ex boyfriend , because I started having these random thoughts again and I told myself that I dont really love him and I'm not myself and I'm lying to myself this whole time. Mind u it wasn't in the only relationship  I was in, it happens in every single one. I get these urgues to cheat and do drugs, drink alcohol etc. I'm starting to be mean and cruel to the person I'm with, idk if I get bored of them so quickly or something's just clicks in my brain and tells me to end it all or you're going to basically choke cuz I'm pretending I'm someone else and I start to change my appearance, likes and dislikes, I almost never feel empathy in these stages,I can't cry I'm just empty. But the point of this is that after I'm done with the relationship I seek for attention from many other males on dating apps or my guy friends. I'm engaging in not safe sex and drink a lot. When this phase is over I start to get depressed again and start thinking why I do what I do and what is the real feelings that I have is it that I want to go back to my ex because I treated him poorly and broke up of off an dumb reason, or I do really hate him and just want to go and hook up and party? My feelings are all over the place. Sometimes I don't even know what feelings really mean. I don't even know if I feel at all because simply I can't explain fully what I even mean. It's really tiring...do u have an idea or clue how to get a conclusion? (I'm aware that getting help would a better option but there's something that sits in me and I can't explain it fully that prevents me from doing it).",

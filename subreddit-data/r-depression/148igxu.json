    "postText": "I've been silently dealing with depression for a little over a decade now, some years are better than others. I feel like you can never truly get out of it in some way. But a question thats been on my mind lately is why do I always get a feeling of I don't belong? Anywhere I go it doesn't feel like a home to me no matter how many things tell me it is. I just can't escape this dread of going my whole life feeling aimless. Has anyone ever felt this way before, and if so, how have you dealt with it? I wish I could get over this.",

    "postText": "I'm not really sure what drove me to post this. Usually I'd just write in my journal but when I do that I secretly hope the people I'm writing to and about somehow hear it anyway. It's been a rough couple weeks. Keep thinking more and more about packing some books, food, and water and just seeing how far I can get out of here. I've never been happy living out here and things have gotten worse recently. Pushed most of the people I had away it seems. I want to cry but can't muster the tears really. I've had passive thoughts for a long time, thought it was normal to not really want to be around. I'm just starting to feel like I'm reaching a dead end short and long term. No real passions or goals in life, the ones I've set haven't really given me anything once completed. Every time I try to get advice on this stuff it's the same regurgitated \"Just workout. Just get off the internet\" like I haven't tried before. Deep down I think I just want to feel wanted by someone, but it's hard when no one seems to stick around, or when they do they eventually leave again just to return like nothing happened. Just not really sure where I'm headed anymore. I don't really think the future I've set up for myself is one I want to live. I guess I could say I'm looking for some guidance but chances are it'll be stuff I don't want to hear. Not necessarily because it's bad but just because I don't want to face the reality I'm in. Struggling to decide whether or not I'll even post this. Hard to feel like I'm not just whining and asking for attention.",

Does it ever get easier? nope, but there are little moments everyday where I am grateful to still be here. I hope those little happy moments and great memories are coming your way too.",

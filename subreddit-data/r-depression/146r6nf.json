    "postText": "I was domestically abused physically by the respondent, being beaten regularly with a range of weapons including wires, hangers used for clothing, the old plastic balloon holders McDonald used that I would bring home with me after getting McDonalds, a big thick stick that was never used in the house unless it was for punishment, clothing/sheets tied into a knot. Evidence of such incidents is evident with my computer still in my possession, which stand has broken due to her cornering me for a beating and I fell on it.\n\nAs I grew older I became severely depressed and self-harmed, the respondent would tell me to kill myself, threaten to kill me and cornered me with an iron saying that if I wanted to die, that it could be done quickly.\n\nI was threatened with religion, the threat usually being that if I lied that she would pray for God would strike me dead, she would make a mixture of water salt and anointing oil and scare me into doing as she said or I would be struck dead with my hand in the mixture.\n\nFrom the actions of the respondent I have had urine thrown at me, been spat at in my face, body shamed me for being underweight, called ugly, undesirable, a failure, crazy for self harming, I have been called a drug addict and I have been hung out like a freak show in-front of her friends.\n\nThe respondent has walked in on a personal intimate moment and has traumatised me, repeatedly bringing it up in-front of my older sister, I still do not know if she knows till this day and I pray she doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe respondent has rang the police on me because I bought a lock to keep her from sneaking into my room for no reason and staring at me. The respondent then broke the lock and attempted to peep into my room from the exposed hole in the door as I now no longer had a handle. To this day I still have tissue to cover the hole.\n\nThe respondent then closed my bedroom door handle-less whilst I wasn\u2019t home, meaning that I had to burst through the door to have access to my room. The respondent then walked in and out of my room with ease for no reason, pretending to look for items in an empty bag, which is how she walked in to my intimate moment, and watched me do it in the middle of the night until I realised my door was open and looked around and she was just there looking down at me on my bed watching me.\n\nShe never lets anyone know that people are viewing the house and opens my door even when I say that I am undressed she keeps the door open, the only person to even question whether I was decent before coming in was a woman with her child, she let an engineer look at me topless for over 10 seconds before she even considered closing my door not even knocking on the door or anything.\n\nI try every day to love her I\u2019ll buy her food, talk to her about my day etc. But when it comes down to it and I think of everything I break down and want to end it all there and then, which is why I\u2019m posting this memo I\u2019ve had saved since months ago.\n\nI FUCKING HATE HER",

I dont know how old you are and realize there may be things preventing you from getting away from this person but I would at least start planning to leave (saving money, gaining transportation, scoping possible places to stay). \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. You sound like a kind person and deserve better. Thank you for sharing your story, it has put things in perspective as far as my own life and situation.",

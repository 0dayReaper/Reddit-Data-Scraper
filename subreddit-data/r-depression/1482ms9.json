The phrase \u201cyou can\u2019t pour from an empty cup\u201d really resonates for me and I find that I am not able to be a good friend to anyone right now. I feel incredibly selfish wanting to take a break from my friendships but I keep disappointing them by not putting in enough effort. The pressure to be there for them when I can\u2019t even be there for myself has been crippling. The thought of having to socialize just makes the dark thoughts darker and anytime I push myself to do it anyways I can\u2019t wait to get back home. The thought of being alone is scary but the thought of having people rely on me when I can\u2019t come through for them is worse. I feel like such a horrible person and honestly they deserve much better than me. I\u2019ve hit rock bottom and they shouldn\u2019t have to deal with that.",

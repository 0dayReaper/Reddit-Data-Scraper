    "postText": "I just feel like such a complete loser all day, everyday. I\u2019m home for the summer after my freshman year of college and I don\u2019t talk to anybody outside of my house.  I\u2019m not really sure I even have friends, maybe acquaintances, but definitely not any friends who text me without me texting them, or ask to hang out, or I feel like I can talk to. I don\u2019t have a job. I stupidly turned down a summer job I was offered last semester in the area I\u2019m studying (theatre design/tech) because I felt like I wasn\u2019t good enough and just thinking about it gave me anxiety. Now I still haven\u2019t found a job back home despite filling out almost 30 applications. I\u2019m queer in one of the reddest states in the country and live with a family I cannot come out to. I think my Dad thinks I\u2019m just as much of a loser as I think I am. We\u2019ve never been very close, but the less of a stereotypical man I\u2019ve become, the less we talk, the less we do things together, the less I feel like anybody will ever love me for me. I\u2019m so sick of being sad and miserable all the time. I wish I liked myself, I wish I didn\u2019t feel like such a self-hating loser all the time.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this was all over the place, it was more of a rant than anything. I guess I just feel stuck and don\u2019t know what to do. I want to feel normal and I want to feel like I\u2019m doing good.",

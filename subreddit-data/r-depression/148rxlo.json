            "comment": "Having been there, even having to move back in with my parents after graduating because of issues getting a job after uni, I know how you feel. \n\nBut the disgust you're seeing is most likely sympathy that you've twisted because of how you feel about yourself. Before you do something final, find someone to talk to to vent, if you're comfortable doing so then family is the best bet so you can get these feelings into the open. If not then your school should have trained mental health professionals to talk to about your situation. \n\nOften talking things through can make major issues seem less difficult to overcome and the MH people at your school may be able to signpost you to academic hepp if its a single subject you're having issues with. Don't give up on yourself and I'm sure that people round about you will pleasantly surprise you.",

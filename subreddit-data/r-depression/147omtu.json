    "postText": "Depression, this disease is a parasite, sucking all the happiness out of me. I am always sad, devoid of any energy. I sleep all day and yet I'm always tired, I eat so much but I'm never satiated, I try so hard but I always fail. I thought of sharing it with my friends, they all walked away from me, making me feel worse. I always wonder where I went wrong. Maybe it's my entire pathetic existence. \nI had a breakdown in front of my sister once, I was basically paralyzed with fear and depression at that point, and my sister said she wants get away from me as soon as possible or I'll drive her mad. I don't disagree though, my friends got away from me for the same reason I guess. \nThe only ones for me right now are my parents, but I'm afraid they'll start hating me soon, I mean they're parents, very loving ones so they won't leave me ever but I know I'll always be a disappointment. \nI have decided to take matters into my own hands, since this depression doesn't seem to be going anywhere and I know I won't magically stop being a failure, there's only one way out.  Before I turn 23, I'll put an end to the pain and suffering. Soon.",

People don't really put together broken pieces together like that. They probably have things that are broken in their own lives that they're trying to fix. It might help to start pinpointing things that you feel people could help you with reasonably.",

I was there for my boyfriend when he needed help with depression and trauma but once I fell he abandoned me. I have no one else left. I have no job, living with my parents that are close to throwing me out on a street. They never cared anyway. I am a 30 year old failure... They say we are the only ones that can help ourselves but... What's the point of trying if I have no one. Even my cat went missing few days ago and I fear she might not return this time. I tried contacting a call center but no one answered... The only thing that stopping me right now is that I don't want to be even more of a burden to my family than I already am as my brother is going to have a wedding soon and as much as he hates me his plans would have to be changed if I were to die... I wish I could just vanish from reality so that no one were to think about me again...",

But its up to you. No one will start about it but you most of the time. And if you can, get therapy, find the one that you need because its not always the first that can actually help you.",

Remember how much you\u2019ve gone through. It\u2019s all going to be okay as long as you believe in yourself. Truly. Take time to feel your feelings and talk to anyone, online or not, who would get it. Sending virtual hugs!",

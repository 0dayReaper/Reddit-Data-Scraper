    "postText": "I have been Increaslingly more depressed with the past few years. It used to just be apathy, becoming indifferent to situations/feelings. Afew years down teh road and I am actively contemplating ending my life.\r  \n\r  \nI come from nothing, a completely dirt poor family, wherere raising the lessers of the family have become pretty much life's motivation. I was always told i was a smart kid, being able to repair/rebuild computeres when most of my people couldnt even figure out how to reboot a pc. I always thought that may have been my calling, but where i live, if you arent born to the right family, you dont advance in any way. I cannot remember teh last time i have been happy in any way, shape, or form. I've been pushed from one dead end unfulfilling job to another, never finding anything that even remotely resonated with me. I'm stuck in poverty, with no way to escape. I'm constantly weight'd down by bills which i have do pick and choose what gets paid for the month. My physical health is drpping so badly that i dont know how much longer ill be alive.\r  \n\r  \nI am in need of a Dental Opeartion to remove damaged teeth (all of my adult teeeth have become\r  \nbrillte and are breaking/rotting into my gums My family has terrible genetics) The last estimate to correct the dmages was $12,500 USD for the entire operation. Without this opeartion, my teeth will continue to rot into my jawbone, which will become septic, and soon will begin rotting my jawbone and becoming septic, poisoning my entire system and killing me. I have been beggging this world for help for years only to be insulted, made fun of, and treated like garbage.\r  \n\r  \nAs of now, i have no hope, am awaiting this death. And quite possibly considering taking a few lives with me. I used to be a Decent person, with hopes and dreams, I used to carea botu others. Now i feel hopeless, only wishing there were a way i could make this world suffer like i am. I really am hoping i die soon, because i am tired of thinking that this world cares about others.",

    "postText": "I had a therapy session yesterday and felt like a zombie, still do.  I feel like crying over and over again. Rehashing my past hurt more than expected as well as what I thought of myself.  I know it's the healthy route but I felt better not bringing it up again. I feel very low,  no bright happy energy. Food disinterests me but I need to eat.  I'm not sure I want to go back to my therapist.",

And always go with your gut feeling, if you don't feel 100% comfortable with a therapist, find another one. It's great that it's free for you, worrying about wasting money definitely ruined a lot of the therapy experience for me.",

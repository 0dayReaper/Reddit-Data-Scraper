    "postText": "I feel like I have a maximum of two hours a day where I can really focus, make plans, have a coherent conversation and the whole rest of the day is just static. It\u2019s hard as hell to wake up and start my day, I never feel rested. Then by the time I\u2019m driving home from work I feel like I\u2019m on auto-pilot and sometimes I wonder how I even make it home safely. Then in the evening my brain feels empty, genuinely like someone took out the important bits and shoved some cotton balls up there. I am thinking some of the time but I can\u2019t grasp at my thoughts or communicate them, my body feels tired and screams at me to lie down, and often I\u2019m just staring off into space. Can\u2019t prioritize or plan or make things happen, I\u2019m just a shell. \n\nAnd here I am, talking to people on dating apps who apparently work 9-5 then go to the gym then grab a drink with friends and I\u2019m too embarrassed to say that all I did today was go home, fall into bed and completely dissociate. \nFriends want me to come stay at their cabin this weekend? Yeah, that sounds like a fun activity for a 20-something, except for the fact that I\u2019m exhausted just thinking about it and I would honestly rather just lay in bed for three days straight. How depressing is that?\n\nI hate feeling like this.",

    "postText": "I don't want to order more. I hate collecting them from the pharmacy. \n\n50mgs of serteline. Not the highest dose but I've got 4 tablets left and I keep looking at them qnd I have such an urge to just take them all now. \n\nThe tiny slither of logic left in my brain is telling me it's an awful idea but I need people here to tell me the same. Knock some sense into me.\n\nNeedless to say I've had a drink or two. I just want to give up and be thrown into a looney bin and forgotten about by the outside world.",

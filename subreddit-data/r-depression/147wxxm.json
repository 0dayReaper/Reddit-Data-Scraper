    "postText": "I just need to vent for a moment.\n\nI have this one bad habit of how I think about certain situations or the outcome of these situations. And this way of thinking is only harmful for me and has no benefits. Let me explain this with a few examples:\n\nIn school every time we got our exams back i always fantasize me acing the exam even though I am not really good at this subject. And because I am not good at it I obviously do not ace the exam and for some reason I am disappointed in myself because I did not. I know that I am not going to perform well at these exams but nevertheless I say to myself that I could have done better. \n\nAnd if I ace an exam I think to myself that this was easy and I cannot be proud of myself.\n\nTo put it in a nutshell my way of thinking is:\n-If I do not perform well I am a disappointment and I could have done better\n-If I do perform well I tell myself that this is not an accomplishment\n\nAnother example is me fantasizing how different people or friends interact or might interact with me. Something that always depressed me is how I need to ask people to play something or do something in general and those people never asking me to. Almost every time I saw a friend online on discord or something I always wished them asking me if I want to play something or just talk. And most of the time it did not happen which just made me even more sad and depressed. \n\nThis way of thinking is partly the reason why my mental health got so fucked that I wanted to cease to exist. I am trying to \"battle\" these bad habits but it is really tough and right now it is hard for me to imagine that all of this is being worth at some point it because i have not seen an appealing outcome yet. But I am hoping that this appealing outcome will come at some point but it might take awhile.\n\nI am feeling quite uncomfortable writing this and especially posting this partly because I am writing this in a foreign language but mostly because I am afraid of the reaction of the people reading this. This might sound stupid but everything on this post might sound stupid so it does not really matter.\n\nSo yeah, I just wanted to write this because I felt like it.\n\nThank you for reading this!\n\nBye",

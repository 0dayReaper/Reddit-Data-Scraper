    "postText": "She was only 67. She told me every so often about how she always thought she'd end up with her ex husband again and how she thought they were meant to be together in the end, I don't know if she ever got the chance to tell him how she felt.\n\nI'm extremely shaken up, but I think she wouldn't want me to be sad for her.\n\nIn her memory I'm going to tell the people I love how I feel, give my dog a hug, and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when I feel like nobody else is.\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your kind words, I feel less alone about this now. In lieu of a funeral she wanted people to donate to her dog's vet clinic because she was a huge animal lover. Maybe toss a few donations toward your local clinic or shelter to help spread her love even further",

Death is something that everyone experiences, for example my Great Aunt was one of the best woman I\u2019ve known and recently I went to South Dakota to see her in the hospital and she was strong all the way through even after having multiple strokes and I remember her cussing at the nurses for sticking her with iv needles, telling everyone that she\u2019s fine and she can go home, then the day after I left South Dakota she passed. I couldn\u2019t move I was so depressed, but my grandmother reminded me of all the good mementoes and we laughed and cried and even got angry but that\u2019s all ok because she would want us to remember her for who she was not how she isn\u2019t anymore.",

We'll all be in your corner backing you up, I'm positive shes still here too. She sounds like a lovely women who you trusted deeply and she trusted you too considering what shes shared with you as well. I'll send my deepest condolences, its unfortunately all I have to offer. I'll do my best to see if my local shelters will take volunteers to fulfill a good women's dreams. I happen to love animals too and I'm more than happy to help out.\nAgain, my deepest condolences. I know how it feels to lose someone close to you, especially someone who helped you emotionally and socially.",

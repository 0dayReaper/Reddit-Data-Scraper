    "postText": "I've tried to reach out so much to people, no one seems to care. I just want someone to understand me. I'm not just a manic episode, I'm not a monster... I'm a person too, I'm a really good person that tries so hard everyday. I'm lonely, I wish I had a person that I could talk to in real life. None of the meds work, therapy doesn't work.... That's a few people around, but they just can't understand what's going on, what I'm going through, how badly I just want to be a real person.   I've been fighting this for 42 years. I'm tired.  I don't think I'm ever going to find the things that I want so bad.  It's hard to hold on anymore.....",

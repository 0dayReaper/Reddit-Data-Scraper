    "postText": "Before anything sorry if I sound off english is not my first language and im naturally not good with words, not a good combo\n My room has always been just a standing proof of my mental illness because there's no way a normal person would be an ambient like this (and im always questioning and doubting my diagnosis btw) it's the first sign that im getting in a bad place and i just can't talk about it with anyone, not even my close friends, because it's just disgusting\nMost examples of depression rooms i see are just very unorganized with a bunch of stuff in the floor and in bed, witch is very similar to mine but the thing is that my house is quite humid and favorable to insects(if yk south america yk) so when i let it it gets absolutely full of mosquitoes and cockroaches, like, ppl have asked me multiple times if i have allergies or even chickenpox from the amount of mosquitoes bites and other stuff in my skin i have, the cockroaches are the worse because they are just disgusting and i feel like crying every single time i look at one, ive awaken up to find a cockroach in my bed or my pillow multiple times, sometimes i feel them crawling into me randomly and when i do clean my room or at least try (usually every month which it's not a very bad frequency but it just gets the same way a week or two later) i can find up to 13 dead cockroaches and a couple that are alive during the cleaning. \nThe smell it's weird, you can see a lot of mosquito poop over clothes because there's a lot in my closet and a bunch of dead bugs in the walls, there some type of greenish fungus close to a window that is always closed besides of, of course, a BUNCH of clothes, sheets, food and random stuff in the floor and over the table, all this in like 15m\u00b2 so you can barely walk. I still spent the most amount of time i can here, if i don't have anything to do I'll just stay full days here.\nI just needed to rant and get this of my chest because I'm usually VERY functional besides being depressed and none of my friends now about this or would even expect this from me so ig it's a secret. I know that theres definitely way worse scenarios for depression rooms but it still is hard for me, the cleanings have been taking more and more hours, I'm hoping to clean here next Sunday so wish me luck ig\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udec2\ud83e\udec2",

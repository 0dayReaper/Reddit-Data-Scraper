    "postText": "I'm not a good human being. I'm diagnosed depressed for more 3 years but it began before. I did horrible things during my depression. I have a strong sexual desire. That's why i hate more and more myself. I no longer trust myself and no longer self-esteem.\nI try to change, i want to change but recently, i was scammed by a dating website and when i was on dating app, nothing happened. Moreover, i'm failing in others domains. My heart is broken, no more money. I want to cry but i can't. I don't know if i want to meet soulmate or sexual partner. \nI go in all directions but because i'm so confused, so lost. I don't know what to do, i don't know if i want to do something.\nWhen i'm with family or friends, i try to be neutral or feel like i have fun but i feel like i isolate myself. \nWhen i'm alone, i'm so tired, so lost, so confused, sometimes so horny, so sad, so mad. \nSome people deserve a better life and recovery than me. I told you that i'm a bad human being.\nWhy was I born ? Why do i live if i'm suffering a lot ? What am I ? I don't know, sometimes I want that nonsense fight stops...",

Maybe if you\u2019re guilty you can reach out and apologize. We\u2019re all learning and growing in character everyday. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to hold yourself hostage to your past.",

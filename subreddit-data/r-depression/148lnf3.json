    "postText": "I have a lot to say but I\u2019m going to make this post short.\n\nI\u2019m 18 years old and I\u2019m SEVERELY depressed. My problems started last year when I entered a tough period of my life. Before that, I used to be social, outgoing and i was pretty happy with my life. But everything changed after my problems started. I  Nowadays all I do is being isolated in my room, watching porn,skipping school on purpose( although I show up in class sometimes) and fearing that I\u2019m going to live a miserable life. I have tried talking to therapists and psychiatrists but all attempts have ended to no avail. \n\nI also live in a house with a dysfunctional family that I don\u2019t talk to so this adds to my problems even more. \n\nPlease anyone just read this, I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore.",

The more time you spend alone will make you more depressed.\n\nPlay some games or find any good hobby which will help you keep your mind calm.\n\nTake a vacation or something with friends, feel nature.\n\nYou have a long life ahead to think about complicated stuff. For now just try to live your life however you want..\n\nDon't be alone.. always be with someone who makes you happy.",

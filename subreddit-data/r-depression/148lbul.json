    "postText": "I want to float into space until my blood boils over and my face freezes solid. I want to lay in the grass until the earth swallows me whole. I want to be made into tiny little specs that float by in the wind. I want to feel the impact on my bones when the train hits. The splat on the ground after my jump. The blood pumping from my heart onto the floor as I pull the dagger out. I want to fall through the clouds. I want to feel my brain fall out of consciousness. The ultimate form of peace.",

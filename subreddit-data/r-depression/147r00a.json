    "postText": "I\u2019ve been wanting to go in for a psych evaluation for some time now but I have a lot of anxiety about some things.\nFor example:\n1. How did you know it was time to get yourself checked? I have a habit of trying to convince myself I\u2019m not depressed if i have a couple good days in a row, or just basically telling myself I\u2019m fine and am just being dramatic cause there\u2019s no reason for me to be depressed. So how do you *know* that you need help?\n2. If the doctor recommended therapy as the first line of treatment, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to do that because I don\u2019t know how effective that would be for me. I\u2019m obviously all for therapy where it\u2019s needed, but I\u2019ve had this conversation with my friends mother who\u2019s a psychologist and she agreed with me when I said I think I\u2019m too self aware for therapy to be effective for me. The issue isn\u2019t recognizing some deeply buried trauma or trying to come up with better lifestyle habits, because i don\u2019t have trauma and I\u2019ve tried the habit changing and that hasn\u2019t worked. Further, therapy is not very feasible as I live in a brown household and don\u2019t know how to do that without them knowing.\n3. So then the other option is medication right? But i don\u2019t know how comfortable I am with that because some doctors have a habit of handing out prescriptions like candy. I guess I\u2019m asking is if the doctor offered, should I jump straight to medication?\n\n\nI guess my main and biggest question is what do they ask in a psych eval? Just the premise of sitting there and trying to explain my brain which i don\u2019t even understand myself freaks me out. I don\u2019t want to feel invalidated by a cold doctor, and I don\u2019t know what to say to them. Sometimes I feel like I tell myself I\u2019m depressed for attention but then I have to remind myself that a healthy person doesn\u2019t wish to be sick, and also I don\u2019t talk about being depressed so I can\u2019t be looking for attention.",

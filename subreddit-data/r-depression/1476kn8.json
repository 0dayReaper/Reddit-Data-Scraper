    "postText": "I originally posted this in another sub for the SOs of depressed people.  But I didn't realize that dub is dead.  My post was the first in years.  SO I'm putting it here so it will be seen.  \n\nI met my BF in 2017. We are a unique couple for a few reasons. For one, I am a mostly gay woman. In otherwords, I am a lot more attracted to women than I am to men. And he is a mostly gay man. Another thing that makes us unique is we are polyamorous. He has a husband. Husband knows about me, we get along fine. Sometimes we all three even spend time together.But anyway, we met in 2017 when we were both in relationships with other people. We clicked right away and became good friends. Then in 2022 he confessed that he had feelings for me and was carrying a torch for me for a long time. At first I was really hesitant, but I decided to give him a shot. And the first few months we were together were amazing. I have never been with anyone so thoughtful and caring. I fell so hard for him. We are both artists, we used to paint together. I used to wake up to these sweet messages every day telling me how beautiful I am and how much he missed me, etc.And then, his mother in law moved in. This was only supposed to be a temporary situation, but she's been there since October. And he also lost a pet that he had for 10 years who he was really attached to. Those two things were what flipped the switch.Basically ever since January I've seen him go from being this happy, funny, creative, thoughtful, kind person to being indifferent about everything. He has depression and PTSD. He is in therapy, but it doesn't seem to be helping.And I feel like I've been reduced to someone who had a large role in his life to someone who is just in the background. I don't wake up to sweet messages anymore. In fact unless I initiate the conversation I rarely get any messages. I try to make plans for us and he just gives me a ho hum response, \"Oh, we'll see how I feel that day.\" etc. And then when that day comes it's usually, \"I just don't have the energy to be social today, sorry baby.\"I still get told I love you on the regular. But I feel like more of an annoyance in his life than his girlfriend. And I keep bracing myself for something bad... like him telling me he just can't handle having me in his life right now and ending it. He was in love with me for years before I even knew it. And I found someone who is everything I've always wanted, and now because of his mental health issues we might not make it. And I can't complain because then I'm the jerk who is expecting him to just ignore his Depression just to make me happy.And I also get frustrated with him because things that could help and don't take much effort are things he doesn't want to do. Like, he only sleeps a couple hours a night most of the time. He doesn't have insomnia. He just doesn't go to bed. Well, sleep deprivation can't be good for him. He also complains a lot about how messy his house is and says that's making him depressed. But he doesn't clean, either. I've offered to come over and help him clean. I've said, \"Hey, I'll come over, we'll clean your house and then we can go out and get dinner.\" He doesn't want to do that because he says it's not my responsibility. I've suggested he start small by just spending ten minutes a day cleaning. And then when that ten minutes is easy for him, do 15 minutes, etc. He says he just doesn't have the energy.I have OCD and Major Depression too. I've been clinically diagnosed with those things. And a month or so ago I was probably the happiest I've ever been in my life. My art career is going well. Financially I'm in a good place. And I have this amazing SO who adores me. But now I am starting to get Depressed now too because of this situation. I'm trying to be his rock, and be a positive presence in his life... but I don't have my own rock. The only person I can talk to is my therapist. And I know his husband feels this way too. Certain comments Hubby has made to me have made it really obvious. But I would never talk to his husband about this. That would be such a massive betrayal. Like, \"Oh yea, me and your husband got together just to complain about you and your issues.\" I know how I would feel in that situation and I refuse to make him feel that way.Anyway, I'm glad I found this sub. All comments are welcome. I just need support and people who understand what I'm going through.",

You obviously care about him a lot and based on everything you just wrote I know you mean everything to him as well. It\u2019s okay to feel upset by your boyfriends depression, what\u2019s important is that you are understanding and do not lash out. It\u2019s very sweet that you are trying to help him and I think you should continue to do so, but it\u2019s also important to focus on your own mental health. Having a rock is important. It\u2019s also okay for your rock to be your therapist. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I hope that your boyfriend gets better and that one day he can be your rock again. Keep trying to help him however you can, you seem very selfless, kind and understanding. God bless you I really hope you feel better.",

I do not want to force my beliefs on you at all so you can totally Ignore this. But when I had nobody and was so alone in my life, I turned to my religion (Christianity). I\u2019ve been Christian all my life but had never really developed a faith. I started praying more often when my life got hard and I felt really comfortable believing that I always had Jesus looking out for me. If Christianity isn\u2019t your thing I totally get it, but I think praying is a really great thing to try when you feel alone, it helps me a lot. I really like Buddhism too. I don\u2019t treat Buddhism like a religion with religious figures, but I really really find peace in the idea that I can be completely happy if I isolate myself from materialism. Again, I know religion isn\u2019t for everyone, but I just thought it maybe could help. I hope you feel better \u2764\ufe0f",

Where was Jesus when I was being SA'd for years as a kid and I prayed for help?\n\nI have my own set of beliefs.  But having faith in something beyond this doesn't give me any support or comfort right now.  I work the graveyard shit all alone every night.  Most of my friends live far away.  My bf, his husband and his son are the people I am closest to.  And now because of his mental state I feel like I'm losing my chosen family.  Praying isn't going to help with that. Asking some invisible man supposedly living in the sky isn't going to solve this issue.  I'm alone 98% of the time.  So I don't see how talking to an imaginary friend is going to help me feel less alone.",

He would send me these long messages about how much he loves me and how much we were meant to be, etc.  Now I text him in the morning and tell him I love him, he reads the message and 16 hours later still hasn't even replied.  I mean, I know that's stupid to get upset about.  But when we don't see each other every day and live an hour away from each other, it just feels like I'm not even important enough for the 2 seconds it takes to send a text.  You know?  It gets hard to not take stuff like that personally.  Especially when it happens so often anymore.  Like, I find myself assuming he doesn't even want to see me, be with me, etc.  But I know his husband also feels a lot of this, too.",

But I genuinely don\u2019t think it\u2019s a personal choice for him. I don\u2019t know your situation very well, but I really don\u2019t think your bf has changed how much he loves you at all. I\u2019m sure he loves you even more-so with everything you\u2019ve been doing for him. Still, I knwo that doesn\u2019t fix your problems, but it\u2019s okay to feel upset by his indifference. I just don\u2019t want you to blame yourself or think that he loves you any lesss. My assumption is that his depression is causing him anxiety and fear which Is making it harder for him to reach out. I think it\u2019s harder to express your emotions when you are lost in them, and sadly I think your bf is lost in his. Still, do not be afraid that he does not love you ot that he is losing feelings. He really does love you a lot, I can tell based on what you\u2019ve said about him. Just remember that he loves you so much, despite his issues with expressing it.",

    "postText": "Basically, I lived in the same area I grew up until a little over a year ago. Worked for a little bit as a contractor at a nice pharma company where they could not directly hire me. Got a job away (\\~3 hour drive) that was a significant boost pay and experience wise compared to being a contractor. \n\nI was never a social person always had crippling anxiety but did at least have a few friends back home and most of my immediate family. Never had an intimate relationship, never got matches on dating apps, confidence and body image in the dumps, but at least I did have people to do things with to distract me and I had a legitimate support system. I was invited out and included in almost everything, though I really only did like 20% of the things I was invited to. I also was able to make friends through that job as well. \n\nFast forward to being a year away and I have been so absolutely miserable since I moved out here. There is a huge age gap at my new job so its very hard to make friends there and everyone is overworked. I am waaay too socially anxious. I was hoping that I would potentially do better being in a more populated area. When I first moved out here even, I had a friend \\~1 hour away who I saw a few times with his fiance. They pretty much completely ghosted me when I asked out a family member of theirs and was politely declined. Outside of that I got a few matches on dating apps and even met a bunch of people, ghosted every time. \n\nI know theres a lot of meetup groups and things out in this area too but my social anxiety and body dysmorphia really prevent me from going out. There was a period of about 6 months where I didnt leave my apartment for anything besides work or food. \n\nI also can not always just go back on weekends. I have a senior cat who does not travel well, and both of us get bad separation anxiety from each other. \n\nDue to an opening at my former job back home I was encouraged to apply directly since I am no longer a contractor having left. I got the job. Many of my old colleagues and friends reached out to me and want me to come back. Its essentially a lateral pay move with cost of living (and actually a little bit of a raise with bonuses). The real estate market is also way more stable and affordable and I can own property. I am heavily leaning towards taking it to have a support system and friends just to be able to do something, knowing that Id be giving up having a little better luck on dating apps, a lot more social meetup groups (that Im too anxious to go to). \n\nSo TLDR, am I giving in to my mental health issues by moving back to where I'm more comfortable for a job and giving up potential to make a life for myself away from where Im from in a more populated area? \n\nThanks  ",

If you think you have a future in that company back home and it's what makes you more happy and comfortable, go for it. If it's only for reasons like insecurities, then I might not, but like you said you would have similar pay because of the cost of living and even a raise. I would consider that good. I'm no career professional, though.",

If you don't fee like you're growing where you are, then it's time to move on. Even if that means moving back. It doesn't sound like you're giving up, your moving to an equally beneficial career position, as well as putting yourself in a location that would be more beneficial for your mental health. \n\nI personally went to school about 4+ hours away from all my friends and hometown. I was miserable so after 2 years I went home for a gap year. Went back to (a different) school, got my degree and proceeded to move back to the city that was close to my hometown. Yea there's less opportunity for me here, but my friends and family mean the world to me and I don't feel like I'm compromising my goals by placing my self in a position where my career comes second to my personal happiness.\n\nEvery step is a step forward if you're learning and growing.",

I wouldn't have considered it if it was a paycut or a downgrade experience-wise. Positions are very similar and experience from each has been relevant to the other. \nI am nervous about how my current job will react when I put my notice in, but I am hopeful they'll be understanding based on my more personal reasons.",

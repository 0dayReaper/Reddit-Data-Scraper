Sometimes I wonder, if I get (arranged) married tomorrow (rhetorically), I would not be a good husband.  All I've ever done is just love &amp; give &amp; make her the Center of my world. (8 rejections, all different girls). I'm not sure how to behave &amp; how to accept being loved &amp; be someone's else's Center of attention. Not to scare but that's the truth. You only know things you've done or practiced &amp; being loved back isn't one of them. How will you or me deal with that?",

I had latched onto her and slipped in and out of depression. In this moment I am fighting every instinct to reach out to her. I know I need love and care right now though. But who and how do I ask that of other people without bringing up the affair and  dealing wit that crap. I can't let go long enough to see if she will show me un-solicited love. Instead I just reach back out and cling like a loser and the cycle continues. I am so tired of saying I need love, or to break down to receive it. Uuuhh.",

You'll feel like shit for a while but you'll start to find things outside of being in a relationship that'll make you whole.

Straight up (I'm sorry if this seems harsh) fuck that person.\n(Not literally)\n\nIf they aren't able to accept you for every piece of your individuality (no username pun intended) and personality then they weren't right for you. Or perhaps you believe they are, then perhaps try and connect with that person and explain why you feel uncomfortable with them not supporting you. Support in a relationship is super important in my view.\n\nNext, perhaps you just need to find someone who is right for you. And honestly it starts with a simple conversation. Bfore you know it, if the conversation went well, then you become quickly appointed acquaintances, which could lead in to a friendship. And if that friendship begins to feel conforting, it could lead to a relationship.\n\nHonestly I've found being in a relationship with someone you feel safe and (most importantly) understood emotionally around has turned my life around. \n\nYou'll find the right person.

Not a waste of space. You have needs like everyone else. This is about you. You DESERVE to be happy and loved - and you better get started. Start doing the things, that used to make you happy, in small amounts. Watch a movie, play for a while, paint, whatever it takes. Exercise, if only a little. Be with your family or friends for half an hour. I promise you, it will be so tough. You will be exhausted, burned out, downright wasted. But don't give up without a fight. I promised myself, that if I had to go, it would be with a fight. I deserve that. On my grave, it better say: \"never gave up\".

But she told me she loved me. But when things got difficult, when the relationship required work and communication she ran off with someone else. Moved in with him and his kids 2 weeks after leaving me. Ghosted me for 2 weeks before letting me know it was over. Kept telling me she was having depressive episodes but she was really cultivating her relationship with this new guy while I was trying to support her. Sent me into a worse depression than I was already feeling. I handled it poorly, she told me to \"be a man about it.\"\nWas not a good time in my life, embarrassed and ashamed for how I acted, the messages. Never had someone be so cruel to me.",

In my case I realized that I was depressed because I didn\u2019t receive love and affection form someone I loved. But I read a book called As A Men Thinketh by James Allen and my entire world change. Basically the book talks about how influential our thoughts can be. I began to think more positive thoughts and positive changes came knocking at my door. Eventually I came to realize that the only love I really needed at the moment was self love. Once I fully accepted myself and fell in love with myself my life changed. I now didn\u2019t depend on anyone else\u2019s acceptance and could truly value the beauty of being alive and in the moment. So keep your head up, fight the good fight, and realize the strength and value the lies deep inside of you.",

    "postText": "Mornings are horrible.\n\nThey're filled with anxiety. Every little noise, every little dog barking, every meaningless day starter work call is an abuse to my nervous system. Coffee makes It worse. I still drink It though...\n\nNoons are hopeful.\n\nCan I make It through without any significant mental wounds? Without being terrified whether I handled all my conversations with my peers in a way that was appropriate for \"normal functioning\" people?\n\nAfternoons are slow.\n\nI mean, can this day go by any slower? I'm constantly glancing at the bottom-right of my screen: will another call/message pop up, askings something stupid or completely overwhelming?\n\nEvenings are calm.\n\nThey're peaceful. I'm not tired or exhausted. I'm just... numb. Lying on my bed  like a mummy. Some intrusive thoughts here and there, some thinking about the unfairness of the World, but all in all I feel safe. I survived... Only another 35 years of this and I can retire... from work? Or life? \n\nTime will tell.",

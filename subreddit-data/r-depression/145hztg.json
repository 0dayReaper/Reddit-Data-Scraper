    "postText": "I think I need to take anti-depressants but I literally just came to the realization 10 minutes ago. And, I\u2019ve always been VERY weary of it. Not because I disagree, you gotta do what you gotta do for you. But because it feels like my depression\u2019s so intense because how human kind has made life so dull, controlled and colorless. I feel like, what\u2019s the point of trying if there are so many obstacles purposely set up to keep most people down? Running on a hamster wheel just to survive. \n\nLiterally, all I want is a world where humans, the most intellectually advanced creatures in this solar system, build towards good in mass. Where everyone can freely live their lives, for themselves, without intentionally impeding on others. Where we don\u2019t value vanity over community. Where we don\u2019t act on our negative presumptions of others before truly knowing their intent. Where empathy isn\u2019t something that has to be taught. \n\nI feel like if I take medication to manage my mood, im not sure how much it could actually help me if the world will still remain the same. Or is this all just an excuse? I feel like I\u2019m going crazy and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll stay in this state forever and completely ruin my life. For the last year, I\u2019ve been babysitting an alcohol and weed dependency/addiction. I can feel it eroding me from the inside every time I take a hit and shot. And even so I\u2019m struggling to stop because it\u2019s the only thing that passes the time without effort. I\u2019m only 28 and I\u2019m so lost, I\u2019m not even sure what to say to my therapist. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been avoiding our appointments for the past month. \n\nAny insight anyone?",

            "comment": "Meds, yes! I would definitely talk to your therapist about anti-depressants, and then take them if you're prescribed them!\n\nYes, our lives and the world as a whole currently has many issues which can seem depressing. However, meds can get us over the hump so we start engaging with the world again. And maybe (eventually and if we're so inspired) we can even do our part toward making it a little bit better. I like to remind myself of the quote:\n\n*\"Our job is not to toughen our children up to face a cruel and heartless world. Our job is to raise children who will make the world a little less cruel and heartless.\" - L.R. Knost*",

It's just a chemical boost to assist with re-wiring your brain on the road to recovery, but the actual therapy will be doing all the heavy lifting.\n\nIf you can afford them alongside professional help, the answer is a resounding yes!!",

            "comment": "Totally agree with your view on the world on how it should be. I too have been saying for years if humanity is to have any chance for survival even really, we need to become a very empathetic species, otherwise i think we die out or should die out.\n\nFor meds, it doesn't fix anything at all. Which fair warning, it can also be very addictive, something to be careful about as well if have addiction problems. Anti depressants basically freezes your mind in a way. Sometimes this can be useful and it can help people if someone basically want to simply survive cause things might feel too extreme etc, this is the only time and way anti depressants may help, but it does not fix or cure anything. It can freeze a problem until you are in a better spot to deal with it essentially.\n\nWhen it freezes off a part of your mind though, you can easily feel like a part of you is missing, for some this can truly be hell. It can in a way freeze what keeps you alive and breathing, also fair warning that way. Anti depressants can make you more suicidal as well cause of this. Nobody I know have any much positive to say about anti depressants, but i do think it can be handy for people who do rather not want to deal with whatever they are going through or deal later. In those cases i think it can be handy. But if you are a very self aware person, it can be kinda traumatizing to be honest, to be on anti depressants. Therapy can be more useful, often not in the way people think.\n\nThe best thing about therapy is venting, it gives your mind more space to cope and deal with the problems you currently have by letting some of that crap out. Therapy basically can help make it easier to help yourself.",

            "comment": "Meds can lessen your depression to a point where you can start to see things differently. You're totally right about the state of society: meds won't change how this shitty world works. But they may give you enough breathing room that you can see new possibilities for living in the world that you can't see right now, because your brain is stuck in its depressive slump.",

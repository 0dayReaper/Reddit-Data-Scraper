    "postText": "I would say that never in my life was I actually that happy person. Struggled with multiple mental illnesses growing up from OCD, attachment disorder, body dysmorphia to derealization to social anxiety to generalized anxiety and that all threw me in the depression blackhole. I haven\u2019t gotten a break from being unhappy, only now I am not OCD and unhappy and I am Kinda OCD free depressed. How are some brains just wired from birth to be unhappy? Why not have a single break? A medication that actually works? Some therapist who knows a solution? Some kind of above us nature meant to free out fried minds? I am absorbed, angry, devastated at me, at the universe that I got to be that child who was just born unhappy.",

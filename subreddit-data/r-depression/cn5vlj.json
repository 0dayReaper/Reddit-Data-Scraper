A couple of days later depression(undiagnosed at the time) was back in force and all my hope that graduation would finally make me happy was gone. Six months later I was single and I had to move back in with my parents.\n\nI can totally confirm too that all the days start to bleed together, even the really damn good ones, because if you still feel the hole inside you then it wasn't quite good enough.",

Only, even of what's left of the day you can muster at most about two hours of light 'productivity' before calling it a day and telling yourself you'll do better tomorrow, you just have to 'get back into the groove'. \"If I just go to bed at the right time so that I can't help *but* to get up early tomorrow, then it'll be all easier\" But you haven't been 'in the groove' now for longer than you can remember.\n\nWhen nothing within your grasp makes you feel good anymore, downtime just becomes desperately milking distractions for what little cheer up potential they hold all the while lying to yourself you'll just need another hour, or just this evening, or just till tomorrow, and then you'll get 'back to it again'. But, of course, you always end up too exhausted from all the rumination and never being at peace. Beyond that, sleep's sweet oblivion becomes such a comforting hiding-spot.\n\nI've been trying to turn shit around for years now and I gotta tell you, it's an excruciatingly slow process and I'll probably never get to where I think I ought to be.",

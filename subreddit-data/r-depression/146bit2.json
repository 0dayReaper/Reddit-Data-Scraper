    "postText": "\n\nEverything is dead to me. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I just want to crawl up in a ball and rot. I don\u2019t know who I am.  I hate this fucking place and all the fucking people on it.  I hate waking up.  I hate going to sleep.  I hate school.  I hate everything that this fucking shitshow of a planet throws in my fucking face. This is my last resort I don\u2019t know what to do I don\u2019t know where to run.  I want to hide away, get away, but it comes back stronger. I feel like two different people fighting to control my lifeless body. One wants to kill me and the other wants to kill me more. What the fuck is wrong with me. I can\u2019t do this anymore.  Nothing will ever change.  I am doomed to spend the rest of my life wondering what it would be like to not live at all. This is a last ditch effort to save what little sanity resides in my brain and soul. Please fucking save me from myself",

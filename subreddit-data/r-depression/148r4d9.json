    "postText": "Just for background, I'm 39 with mild PTSD from Iraq and severe depression and anxiety. I went through an awful break up in November with an S.O. that was cheating since late October and I had no idea. I thought everything was ok. We didn't really fight ever. I loved her (still do) and it felt like she was my best friend. I'd been through enough bad relationships to appreciate how safe and amazing it felt. But things fell apart. She cheated on me. It happened so fast. I stopped eating and i was drinking heavily. I lost 17lbs in 2 weeks. I was taking sleep meds (both prescriptions and over the counter) to try to rest but I'd never get more than a couple hours at a time. It lead to a severe panic attack. That left me hospitalized and ultimately involuntarily committed to an inpatient facility at the VA for 7 days. She stayed with me when I got home and I took care of her because she had been injured right before I went to the hospital. I took care of her voluntarily knowing that she was texting this other person and sneaking around. I begged her to stay and work on things with me and ultimately she left. I woke up every day for the next 6 months hoping I would die in my sleep. I had a bottle of painkillers I had gotten years before from an ex that I had counted specifically to end my life and make sure of it. I could never bring myself to do it for fear that she would find me in my home dead or hear about it from my friends and I just didn't want to pause her pain. I also have a cat that I really care for and I didn't want him to be sad I was gone. I honestly had no other reason to keep going. I've been medicated for the past almost 20 years and nothing has ever really worked. So 2 weeks ago I did ayahuasca. It changed my life. For the last two weeks I felt like a different person in such a good way. I had spoke with her before my retreat because I was afraid that the way I felt about her would change and I had heard from her sister that she was really missing me and wanted to come back. We hung out before my retreat and it felt really nice. After the retreat when I had my spiritual awakening, We tried again. It felt good for a few days but I was afraid. I had a lot of fear that it wasn't going to work and that she would hurt me again but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. She fixed things with the person that she was seeing after me to make space for me in her life So it was just the two of us. And only a few days in she was talking about how she missed this other person and she didn't know if she was in love with them or not. It's almost like the medicine was instantly washed away from me. Every good thing I felt just disappeared and I'm right back where I started in November. I feel like she's breaking up with me all over again, that She's cheating on me all over again. I waited 6 months for just to tell me she doesn't know still... And I'm right back where I started... I have so much to live for. I started this new job that pays really well I have a nice apartment, I have a nice car I'm not bad looking but I just don't want to live anymore. From 5 weeks into this new job and all I did today was cry when no one was around. I know she's bad for me so tonight I'm going to ask her to tell me again that she's not coming back. I just don't know how to keep going on like this. I know I'm probably just talking into the void and no one's really listening but I don't want to tell my friends that I'm back to where I started because I don't want to keep burdening people without sad I am and how much I want to die.",

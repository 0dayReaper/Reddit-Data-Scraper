    "postText": "I've been mentally ill for as long as I can remember, major depressive disorder and whatever else they can't diagnose me with. After years of trying to figure my shit out, why am I so depressed?? Why won't medicine work? What is causing this? It's not a chemical imbalance, I realized.  Genes have something to do with the other mental problems but the depression, suicidal ideation &amp; substance abuse are all worsened and caused by my lack of friendships, my inability to find purpose or even caring to find purpose, and living in America which was basically designed to keep us depressed, poor, lonely and miserable. So how do I cope with what I cannot change? My circumstances cause most of my misery, I can't change the capitalist hell we're in. I can't change the fact that I haven't had a community since I was 18. I can't magically make living easier when the cost of surviving is so astronomical that I feel debilitated. I don't want my life defined by what my job is or if I'm in school trying to get a job. I just want a community. I want friends.  How do I heal when I'm trapped in the environment that's doing the damage???",

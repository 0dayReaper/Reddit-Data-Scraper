    "postText": "I've been on antidepressants for the last 3 months and have recently had my medication doubled. Not sure if they're working but I'm going to assume they will be.  \n\n\nAnyway, I have very little motivation to do just about anything, I have been using my time to try to play through all the Zelda games just so I can focus on something and not waste away. What do you guys think I should be doing with my time?  \n\n\nSome important info, I'm 19, male, unemployed, since I live in Canada I'm taking a 5th year of high school, which I have barely been attending, and I don't have a college I'm planning on going to yet.",

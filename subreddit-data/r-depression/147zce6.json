    "postText": "I've been depressed for a few years now, there were a few times I was genuinely happy, and now these past few weeks I've felt fine, tonight tho..I just felt..really really down. I tried listening to some music to help with this feeling. When I do this, I listen to Joji, or some Linkin Park songs, and usually that makes me cry. This time I didn't..I was freaked out by the fact that these songs that make me cry everytime, wasn't doing anything......I even listened to a song that always makes me cry..it didn't do anything..what's wrong with me?",

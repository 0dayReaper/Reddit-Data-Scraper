I\u2019m 27 and I\u2019ve felt so messed up my entire life and just can\u2019t get myself to open up and try to fix this. I\u2019m tired of living like this but i can\u2019t go through with getting the help I need. I don\u2019t want to die but it all hurts so much",

            "comment": "Telling someone about depression is hard for most people. I haven't told my family either. For me it is a part of not wanting to make anyone else feel bad. I feel like there is nothing I can do to change it so why make someone else feel bad about it? But internally I also think I fear the change. While I know they will accept it there is a part of me that wonders what will change. Will they see me as \"helpless\"? Will they try to force me to do something like therapy? Will nothing change because I am an adult and that they don't want to interfere with me life? I don't know. Maybe it is just hard to take off the mask I am wearing. It just feels hard (and wrong) to say anything about it. So you are not alone in this.",

I want therapy but I\u2019ve had a hard time getting that going. \nI do also worry about how people with treat me. I\u2019ve talked to one friend about it and he started treating me differently right away. I know it\u2019s cause he cares but honest it\u2019s really fucking annoying",

Let alone how you feel and what might be be good or bad for you. Depression is for everyone different. For you it might have been better if they stayed the same. For me it might have been better to get a little more extra space. Every situation is different. But in your friend's head it might be something like \"I need to be careful otherwise I might make it worse\" or something like that. Maybe he/she didn't even really realize the change. But if he/she is a good friend you could try to talk about how you feel about the change. A talk could be good for the both of you. Maybe things will go back to how it once was.",

There's always the chance that it'd change the way they treat/react to you from that point onwards. My thinking is that if you come to your family not only with your concerns but also a 'solution/action plan\"' maybe they'd be more reassured. For example, you have depression but you'll be engaging with a therapist fortnightly.\nWishing you the best, take care.",

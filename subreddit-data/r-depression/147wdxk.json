    "postText": "I found my birthday to be a massive struggle. I felt sad pretty much all day which had a spiralling effect because I felt guilty for my partner because she could notice and sort of felt guilty to my self. I kept thinking \u201cone day of the year I wanted to to be happy\u201d. I think the expectations of others put a lot of pressure on me. These \u201cspecial days\u201d are the most defeating I think. I don\u2019t know what the fucking point is. I\u2019m just exhausted. I wish my partner would just leave me and get away from all of this. Always so much guilt.",

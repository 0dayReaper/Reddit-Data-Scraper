    "postText": "I don't know how I should continue living, I can already see that there is no brightness in my future, my life is falling apart and I don't know how I should prevent it. Everyday, I felt like I'm disconnected from the world, I felt like my breath has changed, and I don't felt like eating. Soon my death would be near, maybe by suicide. I don't know how I will continue living, no one would read this, I know that. I don't know how to open up my mouth to tell them about my problem, my throat is tight and my word are stuck. I will be forgotten, and soon, I will no longer appear in this world ever again, because my body will be below the dirt where it cover me up. I don't know what to do anymore, rather than isolating myself and escape, I don't know when my day will come where my body system will shut down.",

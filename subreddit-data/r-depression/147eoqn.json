    "postText": "I normally consider myself a responsible person, and try my best to be as communicative as possible.\n\nBut right now, I feel like I can\u2019t be bother to do that anymore and I feel like I am communicating less than before, and it\u2019s killing me on the inside.\n\nLike, today was the first day in my entire life where I couldn\u2019t be bother with calling out from work or even just forcing myself to go there, even when I was able to do either one or the other in the past. So, I just no call, no show for the first time ever basically. \n\nAnd now, I\u2019m both wracked with anxiety that I may risk losing my job right now because of this no call, no show (that I never had done beforehand) but also simultaneously feeling so indifferent about it because I just feel like I can\u2019t be bothered about it. \nIt\u2019s both making me feel better and worse, because now I feel a little better about not forcing myself to go back into a job where everything seems so overwhelming, but also terrible because I\u2019m worried about getting fired over this and risk not having a backup plan if I do get fired. \n\nI also haven\u2019t been responding to friends and co-workers as quickly or as much anymore, because I feel like that\u2019s too much effort on me now. It\u2019s gotten bad enough to the point that they had even pointed it out to me, because I normally respond in a timely manner; and them mentioning about how out-of-place I\u2019m acting now is making me feel worse about this whole thing.\n\nI\u2019m currently going to therapy and taking my medication now, and it normally works in the past, but now I just feel like nothing\u2019s really working and I recently also been not attending my therapy sessions because I can\u2019t be bother to get up to try anymore. \n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me now, and this is the first time that I\u2019ve ever reached a depressive state where I kind of feel extremely debilitated. \n\nAnyone know if this is just a phase or if something may be seriously wrong with me now?",

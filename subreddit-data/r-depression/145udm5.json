    "postText": "I feel like nobody cares about me. I feel no purpose in life. Idk what to look forward to. All I want is literally just settle down with a partner who has the same life style as me and have fun and live happily ever...but why do they always hurt me and act like nothings wrong. They say they love me but I'm just part of it I guess..this makes me really depressed and feel alone. I wish they can show me with their action but I guess I'm always asking too much...and they expect me to love them unconditionally with my sacrifice",

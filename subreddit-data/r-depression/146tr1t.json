    "postText": "Sorry in advance for the long probably chaotic post.  This is where my brain is at unfortunately.  \n\nThe highs and lows are destroying me anymore.  I can't keep up with everything.  Continously burying myself in work to keep myself from drowning, suffocating whatever you want to describe it as.  I leave home to get away from narcissists and head to work, my once safe space, but now I dread going there because of a coworker there who has been relentless in their bullshit.  He has tried to get me fired several times, has tried to \"set me up\" aka him destroying something and then saying it was all me that did it, he has gone as far as yelling at me and claiming he had to \"scold me\" to correct my wrong doings.  He has spred horrific rumors as far as me doing sexual things to him that are all unwanted by him.  The list goes on, hes doing the same thing to my best friend who also works there.  Everyone who knows me knows its loads of bullshit, the ones that know me well know who my heart belongs to, theres only one that occupies my heart space and head space and it sure as hell isn't him.  Ive ignored this guys bullshit in hopes he would stop but its gotten worse.  Its all been reported, and it will be handled this week when he returns to work.  But here i sit, my brain shutting down, wanting the love of my life with me to hold me tight, ready to break down because of the insane amount of frustration and anger pent up, and not being able to turn off my brain long enough to sleep.  2 hrs of sleep at a time throughout the night up and down...im exausted.  I just want it to end, I surrender to the demons, im not strong enough anymore.",

Give yourself some downtime to sort everything out. You're in a bad spot and a trip somewhere would be a good idea. Visit relatives in another state.",

    "postText": "I(18M) have been depressed for years now. When I was in elementary school I used to get into a lot of trouble because I thought it was a way to get attention (really pathetic) and I became pretty unpopular among my peers because of that. This transitioned into middle school where it got even worse as I was bullied by my teachers as well as my students. I was stupid enough to do whatever my peers told me to do without even thinking which got me in even more trouble. My family attended school meetings because my behavior grew worse and even though my parents supported me by writing letters to the school, I remember I dreaded going to school every day in 8th grade. When I entered high school, things did become better but not really because I was interacting with the same kids from elementary and middle school. The reason I'm writing about this after graduating high school is I feel so inferior and socially awkward. I told my parents about the trauma I experienced but they told me to \"forget about it\" and they don't seem to understand why I rarely socialize with people my age. I want to know how to become more confident in myself and ultimately get some friends. ",

It's not possible and healing is needed first\n\nYou can build your self esteem by reading self-help books on the topic, writing positive affirmations and reading them aloud daily to introduce new beliefs into your mind, journaling about your thoughts and feelings for catharsis, becoming physically fit through an exercise you enjoy, joining an interest group via a site called MeetUp so as to make friends with people with similar interests, having emotional boundaries with other people",

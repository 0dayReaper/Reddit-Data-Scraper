However, when I woke up, I found myself with tears in my eyes (like, literally the moment I woke up, it was like I was crying during my sleep), and was feeling fairly emotional/vulnerable.\n\nIs this a...I don't want to say normal, but maybe harmless is the better word...occurrence?  My mental health has been in the shitter for awhile now, FWIW.",

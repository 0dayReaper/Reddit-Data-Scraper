I realized my 'flare-ups' got bad whenever I'd get reminded I was depressed or a 'trigger' would happen (ie. carnival music). After truly accepting depression as a part of my life, I realized my psyche wouldn't see myself as a victim anymore. I'd taken a date to a carnival and the music itself did trigger something, but it wasn't as strong as it usually was. The sad memories from that turned into happy ones with my date.",

I'm glad you found a way to finally tell depression \"No\"\n\nI'm definitely going to try this!\n\nAlso, regarding Carnival music, I don't think anyone wants to hear that \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23",

I wanted to tell him about it or at least say I'm not doing so good but i couldn't do it.\n\nAnd for you, maybe you could start by saying I'm not doing so well. Like basically showing them that you are not just this happy person with no problems.",

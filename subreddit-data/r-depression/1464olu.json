    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI wanted to share that lately, I've been experiencing a loss of interest in various aspects of my life. I find myself constantly having lustful thoughts, and I've noticed a decline in my coordination and clumsiness. Specifically, I'm finding it challenging to maintain my motivation to learn new skills related to my job as a software engineer. Additionally, I'm struggling with focus, and this has resulted in me being let go from my jobs on multiple occasions. I'm reaching out for your assistance and guidance. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you.",

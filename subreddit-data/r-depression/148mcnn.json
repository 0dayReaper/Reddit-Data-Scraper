            "comment": "Possibly both! I have both and it sucks, I usually always feel down - and when I don\u2019t it\u2019s not really feeling happy, it\u2019s just kinda feeling ok. The bpd makes my mood switch really quick and for no particular reason so I could be feeling fine and then feeling the most depressed I\u2019ve ever felt with nothing having triggered it. I\u2019d talk to your doctor or psychiatrist again and just explain everything and ask their opinion",

            "comment": "Heey so i have bpd, well im diagnosed in Sweden there\u2019s no way of knowing really, the psychologist just put it on paper and the threw me out it\u2019s been 6 months since my diagnosis and I\u2019ve not heard one word. \n\nAnyhow here\u2019s how I know I have bpd, I tend to idealize something or someone for a period of time then with a minor changer or something negative my entire perspective changes so I might hate this thing or person. Over time I get used to it but it\u2019s cost me A LOT of friendships and relationships. \n\nI switch in mood all the time it\u2019s hard to keep up maybe I\u2019m like on clouds super happy for a couple of hours then BAM I feel gloomy all over again. During stress or what I describe as boredom and emptiness I get extremely suicidal and very weird thoughts that I can\u2019t control. I get guilty and then even more what to kill myself until I do something else and my mood switches once more. \n\nIn relationships or even friendships I\u2019ve always had an INTENSE fear of being left out abandoned ignored and vice verse it\u2019s been real damn hard and just because I have knowledge of this doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s easier. \n\nI\u2019ve had people tell me I\u2019m manic because all of a sudden I can handle 2 jobs school friends and activities, I decide to buy stupid shit and dye my hair maybe even get a piercing for maybe a day or two maybe even up to a week and then bam the switch flips and I\u2019m super depressed and can barely get out of bed. \n\nI\u2019m messed up I like to test my friend and so to try their loyalty due to my fear of being left or betrayed and well yeah that sums up the borderline for me. \n\nOoooh and a key thing, I always try to change things because I never seem to know. One minute I like something the next I hate it. Shit if someone asks me who are you I would say no fuckin clue who do I look like to you? I only know what I like and dislike food whose and similar things like materials, experiences and so on\n\nHope this helped a little",

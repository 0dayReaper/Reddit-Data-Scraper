I tried falling asleep and going back to that dream but it didn\u2019t work :( since then I\u2019ve had one other dream with him in it and it was when we were walking down a dark corridor and I was following him holding his hand, I couldn\u2019t seem to get a good look at his face like it was familiar but it kept changing the more I looked at it. I must\u2019ve started crying somewhere in my dream because I woke up with a stuffy nose and my eyes felt like I\u2019d been crying.

I finally felt the void I\u2019d been carrying for 8 months was gone and back in his arms. Everything was perfect for what felt like an hour. I woke up to my phone ringing. My mom wasn\u2019t coming to visit me as had been planned\u2014 her 2nd time canceling a trip. She proceeded to cry on the phone to me about her other problems which led to me comforting her though I felt betrayed by her nonexistent need to ever visit me and her selfishness. While it validated my feeling that I\u2019ve been raising her all these years, mothering her. Minutes later, a law firm called. The firm rejected to take on my case against a couple who\u2019s dog attacked me while I was walking it. They denied it because I was hired to walk the dog and there was some complications with the fact I was in charge of the time the dog attacked me which sent me to go to the hospital. It sounded like b.s. At that time I had already been diagnosed with depression, I couldn\u2019t find the motivation to call a lawyer for more than a year and never went for further treatment for my arm, which was against doctors advice. I finally gathered the motivation to make the call, spent a week waiting. And now i was denied. That was the phone call. \n\nI can\u2019t describe the mood I felt. Having felt those really serene, peaceful and perfect moments and then waking up to reality audibly reminding me of my issues. But I\u2019m not giving up fighting to get out of this deep, dark, warped mindset. I\u2019m cleaning right now, trying to stay active. I\u2019m still extremely dependent on marijuana to feel ok in my free time and I just spent an hour crying over a movie that triggered my feelings of loneliness but I\u2019m still trying.",

    "postText": "TW: family trauma, relationships, LGBTQ+, suicidal ideation (no intent to act on it)\n\nI feel like I have no control over my life.\n\nMy father almost died last year and we're doing our best to help him recover, but I know everyone is exhausted. It doesnt help my room is across from his, so I get to hear my parents argue in frustration\n\nMy partner is currently questioning their gender and when they talked about soon coming out, I just got quiet and sorta panicked. I want to support and help them, its just such a big change and I dont know whats going to happen. Tonight they told me they want a break from talking about that stuff because they're worried I'm gonna be upset.\n\nI'm fucking up everything in my life. I just want to be alone, because I only make things worse. Today I wrote down how everyone in my life would be better off without me. I won't be another stressor, I won't be a burden. I'll just curl up into this darkness and shield myself away from the world.\n\nI just want to be home, but I can't find that anywhere.",

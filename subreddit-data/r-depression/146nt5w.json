    "postText": "I feel so alone like so so alone it\u2019s crazy how this feeling is. It\u2019s literal torture for me. I don\u2019t have anyone to laugh with to talk with to say stuff I saw today to just speak of the things I like. It\u2019s torture keeping all my problems and my hobbies and the things I like in my head all by myself. I constantly just talk with myself in my head I\u2019m my only company and it\u2019s the loneliest shit ever. I\u2019m scared of suicide but I\u2019m just thinking of dying cause I just want to be at peace I can\u2019t live with myself if I\u2019m just alone and keep making sucky friends who don\u2019t even care about me. I sleep at 4 am everyday and wake up so late and tired. It messes up the things I like and it messes up how I feel and I just go in a shitty mood all day. I just want this to stop. And I wish the only \u201dfriend\u201d I have will talk to me more cause i honestly miss u a lot and feel like I could do better.",

You won't excell at anything unless you're interested in the area. For me it's writing and music. I tried Journalism in college, was deeply depressed, took a break and went back to study Music Production and haven't looked back. \n\nWhat are you interested in?",

Oh man, do I know that for a fact. That\u2019s life though. No hobbies or skills? Well, my friend. Go out there, find some hobbies, sharpen some skills. Nobody saves us but ourselves. What does saying \u201cI have no skills/hobbies\u201d do? All you\u2019re doing is putting a limitation on yourself that doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s ok to be scared or anxious in a new environment but it\u2019s not an excuse not to try. We\u2019re the authors of our own life. \n\nYou\u2019re only a disappointment if YOU say that. You barely graduated? So what, you still did it. If you did it with mental health issues, well shit\u2026Even more power to you cause that\u2019s hard, cut yourself some slack. Change your thought process, pull yourself out of the mud. You have air in your lungs and a thought in your head, so that means you\u2019re more than capable. \n\nShoot, if you feel like you need to address these mental health issues fully before you start, go ahead, you know best. Every lunatic who climbed a mountain started from the bottom, one foot in front of the other. Get after it, big dawg.\n\nEdit: Spelling.",

You have all the control but you\u2019re acting like you don\u2019t. I wish somebody told me what I am telling you when I was in my early 20\u2019s. Can you define these buzz words? What\u2019s a winner? What\u2019s a loser? It\u2019s naive. Life is not a one size fits all. You will only fail if you continue thinking like this. The world is yours. I\u2019ll give you an example, it\u2019s not Braggy cause I dunno any other way to say it. \n\nMe at 20: no therapy, still reeling from horrendous childhood abuse (it still haunts me) kicked off my college tennis team cause I slacked academically, kicked out of the university shortly after. All my bands had failed. I was in absolute denial that my then girlfriend had cheated on me (she had) an I had to move into a converted barn turned \u201cstudio apartment\u201d where I had no control over heat/air cause my landlord was a jerk. I spoke just like you are now, \u201cI\u2019m done. Not everyone wins.\u201d I ate like shit, I stopped working out, just drinking with shitty \u201cfriends\u201dand just over indulging in shit that doesn\u2019t help you. \n\nMe in my early 30\u2019s now: wife (she\u2019s a hottie AND a doctor. How the hell did I manage that?!?!) a house, I\u2019m writing this while my 2 year old son is on my lap and he\u2019s my best bud in the whole world. I have a career in a passion I found (writing/editing) and the record label my band is signed too, just shipped me the test pressing of our latest album on vinyl. Having an album on vinyl is a dream I\u2019ve had since I was 10. My life is still full of hardships, depression and anxiety but I addressed my mental health, I either train BJJ, lift weights or run 6 days a week, eat healthy and drink water. All things that have helped me immensely in the endless battle that is depression. Life is still a mental struggle but I found ways to win. All of this happened because one day I said, \u201cI have to change this.\u201d That\u2019s it. It all started there.\n\nWhat makes me a winner is not because of what I have now but because I never gave up when I didn\u2019t have shit. Even then, there are no winners or losers, I\u2019m just a person who tries. \n\nI hate to rant but this post just hit home for me. It ain\u2019t easy but it never will be. Start today. Find one little thing you can change. I don\u2019t even know you but I believe in ya, dude. I\u2019m not a professional, nor is this professional advice but never hesitate to reach out if you need to vent. Everyone deserves to be heard. \ud83e\udd1d",

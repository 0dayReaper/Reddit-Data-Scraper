    "postText": "One day I\u2019ll suddenly be feeling great and I\u2019ll be super productive, talkative, happy, exercise a lot and often the whole day, higher energy, higher self esteem. It feels a bit like I\u2019m walking on clouds and I also feel slightly agitated. This usually occurs after several weeks of being depressed and barely or not being able to get out of bed.\n\nHowever my feelings of euphoria never last, and they either crash back down again into depression or ebb away into somewhat normalcy, depression returning shortly after. It feels so cruel to have glimpses of happiness only for them to be quickly stolen from me. Whenever I find myself in a good mood or happy my first thought is to dread when it\u2019s going to plunge back down. I used to not have the euphoria and just the depression and I was significantly more functional although equally miserable. I did have some periods of euphoria, but after I went on antidepressants the euphoric periods became more frequent and intense. \n\nI know it sounds like I\u2019m spoiled because I\u2019m complaining about being happy, although I do enjoy my euphoric times a lot. But honestly it just makes my depression seem way worse in comparison, and dropping from euphoria into depression is an emotional whiplash-inducing experience and makes it more difficult for me to function. \n\nHave any of you guys experienced this? Is this common in depression?",

    "postText": "I'm almost 23, and when I graduated from high-school I completely failed to transition into adulthood because I'm unable to hold down a job for more than a month. I always have a severe mental breakdown and ghost my employers.\n\n\nI just got my first job in a couple years and there's nothing wrong with it... I like the people there, I'm paid decently, I haven't even been made to do anything particularly difficult or stressful. I'm still early into training. But even though I have no reason to complain, I can't do it. Tomorrow I have to work my first full shift and I just can't.\n\n\nI'm not lazy. I want to work, I want to have the money I need to start my own life. I can't quit because I would feel so ashamed and embarrassed, and everyone would be disappointed in me. Since last night I have considered hurting and majorly disfiguring myself so I can be sent to a psych ward and be given pity instead of judgment or dozens of different suicide methods. I was scared to drive to work because I thought I'd fatally crash on purpose. Today at work I considered leaving on my break and never coming back, or faking a family emergency, or just running out the door. \n\n\nI can't handle the shame of quitting, but I just can't do this. This isn't a suicide note or anything, but it really feels like the only way out. How am I supposed to live when I just can't work? How am I supposed to cope with the shame of being such a burden?\n\n\nedit: I quit and I feel like a piece of shit for doing so",

The next day I wrote notes for all my friends and family and took a packet of codeine I had been saving and put on some music and went to sleep. I woke up to my nan crying and dad shaking me while I\u2019m the phone to and ambulance, next minute I was at the hospital getting my stomach pumped. \n\nThe hospital admitted me to their physc ward where they started me on antidepressants and I began seeing a physiologist and physiatrist. I never got over my ex I dropped their stuff back and never got to hug them goodbye and that was the last time I ever spoke to them, I miss them \n\nI have been staying on my meds doing what my physchiatrist  and physiologist tell me, I\u2019ve gone back to school to study horticulture and follow my love of plants, I see my friends all the time I have family that support me but I still don\u2019t want to be here and it feels like I\u2019m an ungrateful little shit. I know there are so many who would kill to be where I am so why can\u2019t I just be happy, I don\u2019t remember the last time I was actually happy and not just faking it.\n\nI feel so shit because everything went right and I\u2019m still depressed \n\nI\u2019m sorry",

            "comment": "External circumstances won't fix depression, good or bad. I don't want to be here either, but here I am! I deal with it. Part of it is letting go of everything that you can. What's important? What keeps you healthy? Like it or not, part of it is taking care of yourself so those who are connected to you don't have to take on your suffering. Life seriously blows and it's no wonder people hate it even when they have \"everything.\" \n\nI've let go of the expectations my family, my friends, the micro/macro spheres of influence projected onto me and now I play games to see how little I need to feel content. What's really necessary? Honestly, only the fools are happy. I'd rather be stone sober depressed than drunk, high and oblivious. Not saying you should be one or the other. I think maybe trying getting off of the happy-depressed continuum and jump on over to a more content-focused world view. Help others alleviate their suffering, if possible. \n\nYou don't need people, circumstances, or things to be content. It's a cultivated state of mind. It isn't giving up, either, it's something else. \n\nNothing to feel sorry about. Life is a shit sandwich, the joke is people grin and smile while they're eating.",

I stopped drinking, drugs, and even smoking, and my ED is under control.\nTreatment centers multiple times, so many psych unit visits.\n\nI still wake up every morning wishing I had just died in my sleep and upset that I didn't.",

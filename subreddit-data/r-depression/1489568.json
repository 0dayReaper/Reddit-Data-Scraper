    "postText": "I must be dumb feeling frustrated receiving a message from HR for an interview. My mom kinda forced me to apply for a position that idk have any idea how to do. And i even had panic attack just thinking about that deliberation. thinking i would embarrass myself infront of the board not knowing what im talking about. i really dont wanna go. But my mom thinks im a failure as it is and by not going im kinda proving her right. It sucks. I just really wanna disappear rn. She told me im being negative and that triggered me a lot rn. You try to get better, but sometimes ur family is the one causing shits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do i do tho? It feels really heavy rn.",

Considering you're an adult (or almost an adult, either ways) you can't be told what to do. While I absolutely agree that parents hold a greater influence on you than any other, it mustn't have more influence than yourself. You're not gonna give a shit about someone describing you through derogatory words or something on the streets. You could disappear, but what's really the gain?  \n\n\nI'm here if you need someone to talk to bud. :)  \nAll the best.",

Something she cant do to my sibling tho. That's why i get triggered a lot. Makes me feel worthless af. makes me feel like a total failure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand covid graduates finds it hard to land a better job. and the pressure sometimes is just overwhelming i cant handle it. it thought i was okay but. crap im not.",

Promise to yourself you will recover, with confidence promise your mom you will find another job if need be. Broaden your horizons, career wise, attitude wise, do not blame everyone else. At the same time understand it\u2019s going to be hard anyway this goes, but believe in yourself coming out to see the light at the end of the tunnel.",

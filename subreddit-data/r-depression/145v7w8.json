    "postText": "I've been severely depressed for over a year now, and today I have come to the realisation that I don't know anybody who had depression and overcame it. I only know people who either have never been depressed or people who is still depressed.   \n\n\n**TLDR**; I do everything I've been recommended both by professionals and people I know or advice from the internet, and it's not really changing how I feel. The only difference is that now I am functional, I can't do things like work that before, depression wouldn't allow me to. And I don't know if this is normal, like just a step in the middle, or what to do now. I want this to stop.  \n\n\nI've been doing therapy, and to be honest it helped a little, but I think right now it's just being useless and a waste of time and money. I also have ADHD, which makes depression worse, it's just harder to get out of it, Or so that said my psychologist and psychiatrist. So, they want me to take ADHD meds, but this psychiatrist is in my home country and can't prescribe them here, I live in Berlin, where getting certain medical appointments is an impossible mission, and have been looking for one here for 3 months already, and nothing yet...  \n\n\nSo it feels like my psychologist is more like waiting for me to get the medication, and not really doing anything useful in the meanwhile. It feels more like just a conversation, and not therapy. This is the second psychiatrist I've been to, since my depression got worse some months ago. And I changed my previous one because of this, she literally said there was nothing else she could offer, before I take medication. And the current one disagreed at first, but now it feels just like that, I haven't told her this yet, I'll do it in the next session.  \n\n\nThis makes me wonder if it is really nothing else to be done now, other than waiting medication and/or more time passes. Is this true? I doing everything I can to come out of this shit, all the things my therapists have told me to do, and the obvious or more common stuff. Do more exercise, talk to people, be outdoors, socialise, have a routine, be grateful about the good things, etc.  \n\n\nAnd I feel almost the same, the only difference is that people can't tell. They see me so much better, That in a way I am, now I am functional. In the worst part of this, depression wouldn't allow me to work nor do simple things like keeping my home tidy or take showers often. Which is great and I am happy about that, life feels more normal, yes. But it doesn't feel not even near as things felt before.  \n\n\nI can't truly enjoy things, and I just force myself to do everything I do, including things I do \"for pleasure\". Also there is nothing I truly want to do. Maybe only sleeping, but most time can't even do that, I've always struggled with insomnia (which probably is bc of my ADHD).   \n\n\nSo I just hate my life, can't enjoy nice things, and I'm always tired. Sometimes my chest hurts, because of anguish. I really want this to stop, I've already lost more than a year feeling like this. Is really nothing I can do now? ",

    "postText": "Just recently got out of a three year relationship and it really sucks especially since the breakup was on my birthday. It\u2019s been a month now and I\u2019ve tried multiple times to ask my friends to just vent or hangout to get my mind off of it. I understand maybe they don\u2019t want that burden or something? But I just can\u2019t help but feel like maybe they don\u2019t like me or something. I\u2019ve got so much emotion bottled up and it\u2019s killing me. I just want someone to care. I hate being alone. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m specifically asking for right now but I just need some type of help",

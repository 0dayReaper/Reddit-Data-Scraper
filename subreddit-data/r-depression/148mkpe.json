    "postText": "I don\u2019t know if anyone will even see this or care but I need to get my emotions out. This might be a long one.\n\nI was born in China around 30 years ago and my parents worked really hard to take me and them out of the country to the western world. I know they did it to care for me but it resulted in them not being there for me as a child. My mom\u2019s mom and dad (grandma and grandpa) took care of me most days. While I loved them dearly, it couldn\u2019t replace my mom and dad who were too busy and messed up with their own mental health to provide me with warmth and unconditional love.\n\nFast forward we moved to the Western world and my parents struggled. Especially my mom. She had and has crippling ocd and couldn\u2019t get work. She gave me her negative outlook on life. My mom and dad pushed me to study when all I wanted was a friend. I was beyond lonely. I lost all my friends when I moved away from China and I no longer had my grandma and grandpa.\n\nFast forward again to junior high and I was socially awkward and I resorted to keeping my mouth shut and to blend into the wall so as to not get picked on by my peers who had their own mental health problems. I was known as a kid who laughed and smiled and was super inquisitive and willing to make friends. Junior high pushed me to be a wallflower.\n\nFast forward again to university where I completely sucked at my chosen profession because my mom was convinced if I chose accounting I\u2019d have a stable life and job. I believed her and pushed myself to only study and have no social life because if I didn\u2019t do that I would fail. In 4th year an instructor entered the university scene and he was charming and good looking and I was obsessed with impressing him because he made me feel good about myself because he was manipulative. I learned later on he slept with a lot of my classmates. I got into the terrible habit of trying to impress a disrespectful narcissist who could never love me.\n\nLater on after graduation I couldn\u2019t find the type of job all my professors told me to find. They told me to become a chartered accountant in Canada. I couldn\u2019t find a job who would help me get my designation because my gpa was too low. Finally after two years of self loathing my best friend found me a job at a big accounting firm. I thought my life was finally turning around.\n\nI spent the next 4 years hating my life but lying to myself, and telling myself that once I got my designation my life would turn around.\n\nI struggled to get my designation for years now, constantly failing, and now that my time that I have to get my designation is almost up, my company laid me off last week.\n\nNow I\u2019m sitting in my pjs crying all day not able to take on adult responsibilities.\n\nI'm too embarrassed to wear my engagement ring and I want to leave fianc\u00e9 and block my best friend. I don\u2019t deserve them and I want to drown in my depression and ocd and disappear off the face of the earth. I\u2019m a failure and it feels like that\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be.",

    "postText": "Ive reached another breaking point in my life today, I noticed that the girl i liked has a crush. At this point, all my stresses and trauma have been snowballing for my 19 years of life. My heart hurts so much I want to cry but I cant cry, I dont know why but lve lost the ability to cry. I want to tell people about my my stresses and past trauma but I cant find anybody to vent to, Im just tired. Im still waiting for the day where I can actually feel true happiness, but for now , It is what it is.",

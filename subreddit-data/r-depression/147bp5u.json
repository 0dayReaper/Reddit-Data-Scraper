He's encouraging but he thinks I can do everything... which just makes me feel like shit because I can't do everything.\n\nMy life is expanding in directions of opportunity, but I don't have what it takes to handle these new responsibilities. I'm just faking it all and making it up as I go along. I have no clue what I'm doing. Everything is going to come crashing down in my life like it always does. Idk if I know how to do the work to prevent that from happening.",

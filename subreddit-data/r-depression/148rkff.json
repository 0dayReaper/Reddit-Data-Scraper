    "postText": "There are so many reasons why high functioning depression is so challenging. Nobody reaches out because on the outside your achievements should be attributed to happiness. Although, I am doing well and are seen as successful, none of these achievements have given me much or any joy. I express gratitude every single day but do not feel fulfilled, no matter how high the marks are, no matter how much praise and recognition I get I still don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve accomplished anything significant. I feel overwhelming gratitude for the help I get from others and do cry from the touching generosity. Why the fuck doesn\u2019t any of this make me happy. I can\u2019t find it, I try everything, I am so burnt out. I feel so disconnected, work hard as a single parent to make a better life but I hate to see myself not experience much joy. I am simply existing for my son, working hard to be a good parent and put on a face for him. I will never let him know how much I struggled, never make him feel less than a beautiful blessing in my life. Post partum phase should have been over long ago. My counsellor told me I was doing so well and that I should be experiencing joy unless I believe I don\u2019t deserve it and I don\u2019t feel that way at all, I know I\u2019ve worked hard and am pushing myself and deserve happiness. She dropped me as from the outside again, I should be happy and have come a long way since I first saw her. But my main issue that I went to her with was lack of joy and that hasn\u2019t been resolved. I am exhausted, I am over being empty, I want to feel supported and I don\u2019t want to have to be a mess for people to be there for me. I\u2019ve reached out but am far away from friends and family. I suppose I just want to be heard and understood, by people who may feel the same. Thank you for reading/listening.",

    "postText": "I have no reason to be such an awkward person, I have a good family and many friends, or I did.\n\nAfter graduation I moved away and lived alone for 8 months. I was a party kid in highschool, since 15 Ive been regularly smoking pot and drinking. When I first lived alone I stopped smoking and started drinking more. Nowadays, and since maybe February, I drink all day.\n\nIf im unemployed I wake up, drink, and watch Youtube or listen to music all day. I rarely blackout, Im just content to get less and less present all day. If I have a job I drink the night or morning before and right after, I act pathetic and quiet around almost anyone in a public setting. I shake and twitch constantly, I have the darkest eyebags you have ever seen.\n\nI had a lot of insomnia when I lived alone, thats improved as has my diet since coming back to my hometown. My people skills have improved a bit as well and people think im funny at my new job but I\u2019m calling in more and more. My manager is my high school friend and he has been very supportive, I\u2019ve lied and said I have some sort of blood problem and hes bought it but I was supposed to work today and im not going to because im drinking.\n\nA few nights ago I heard voices all around me criticizing me and I could hear my friends cheering for me to be arrested and wanting to beat me up and calling me a pussy and all sorts of shit and I hid in my bed, drunk and terrified and delusional. I called my friend twice confused and slurring and asking where he was because I could hear him outside. (This is the friend whos also my boss.)\n\nHe was in bed both times and I have never heard a human sound as concerned about me as he sounded responding to my call. He asked if I was ok and seemed genuinely disturbed.\n\nI am doubting my reality, I am scared that whatever front I have to convince people im not a massive drunk is cracking.\n\nI used to like rum, now I exclusively drink high ABV vodka and I go to the liquor store almost everyday. I get sick if I manage to not drink for a day. I just nurse on vodka all fucking day. \n\nIm scared I have wetbrain, Im scared that im going to hear voices again, im scared that my friends will give up on me because I just get more cold, awkward, and rigid every single day.\n\nSo thats off my chest i guess lol idk what im asking for.",

I\u2019m not sure I can be of any help but.. since you shared you thoughts thought you wouldn\u2019t mind me sharing some too. Is there any way you can go to rehab? Insurance? Therapy? Most of the people who died in my family from alcoholism had some sort of mental illness. I don\u2019t think things would have gotten so bad if the root issue causing the alcoholism had been treated. Based on the voices you hear in your head it does seem like you have some inner turmoil that you\u2019re trying to numb.",

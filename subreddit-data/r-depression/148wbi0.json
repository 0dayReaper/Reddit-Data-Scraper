    "postText": "I was homeless 4 months ago, my mum kicked me out cause I drank to much in order to cope with my depression and then I had to quit school to find a job and get on my feets, was in this homeless shelter for 2 months and that's not a home, in 2 days I'm going to move out into my own place finally. Guys I'm so scared to screw this up. I have spent 6 months of 2022 locked up in psychiatry due to suicidal depression. It was such a long road but goddamnit I'm not even drinking anymore but knowing how deep this hole inside of me is, I'm just so scared to stumble and fall back into this hole. Make a mess of my rooms, make a mess of my soul again. Any tips? I'm so goddamn scared. Lost my therapist cause I turned 21 also which is why I've got no one to turn to. :/ Love y'all and please never ever allow yourself to do it. Yk what I mean.",

I obviously don\u2019t know what your exact troubles are but I think it\u2019s worth trying everything before making that massive decision. Two cats may sound like a small difference in the grand scheme of things but I think if you got another one and spent some time with the two of them, it may springboard into more life changes. \n\nAnyway, as someone who knows someone that tried to kill themselves and entirely regretted it, I would urge you to consider that it is not going to be the solution you expect it to be and actually might cause things to get significantly worse. Do you talk to anyone professionally? I know there are a million \u201csolutions\u201d out there that all seem pointless and overblown, but I really do believe that you might as well try every last one before considering suicide.",

It kills me to see posts like this because I remember being there myself and I wish there was a magic word that let people understand that there\u2019s actual life after these hopeless years. \n\nFor me, it became a matter of constantly evaluating my choices. I always said to myself, \u201cwell, I could try this one thing, and I think this thing sounds ridiculous and it definitely won\u2019t help, but the other option is killing myself. If I kill myself, I can\u2019t try that one thing, so I\u2019ll try the one thing first, just to know that I\u2019ve done it\u201d. Obviously, though, there was always another \u201cone thing\u201d to try. So it was like \u201cI\u2019ll try therapy before I kill myself\u201d, and then it was \u201cI\u2019ll try writing before I kill myself\u201d and so on. It was like I was crossing off things on a bucket list before actually deciding to kill myself. But after a while, I realized that it was going to take me forever to kill myself because there were so many things to get through. It sounds weird but it actually seriously helped me. Technically, \u201ckilling myself\u201d is still on my bucket list\u2014I just have to try every single thing in the world before I can get to it. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this is the way you need to look at it. I don\u2019t know your situation well enough to prescribe a solution, but I think if you\u2019re posting here then at least part of you knows that you don\u2019t have to be alone and that there is a chance for connection. There are so many people like you that just want to feel okay. We\u2019re all trying to find each other. If we all disappear, there\u2019s no hope for any of us. If we stick around, maybe we can all help each other to realize that there\u2019s no such thing as being \u201cworthless\u201d.",

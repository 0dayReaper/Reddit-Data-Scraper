    "postText": "i was recently hospitalized in a mental hospital for a failed suicide attempt, and just got my first bill\u2026 i\u2019m in a massive panic right now because i\u2019m insured but the hospital billed me the full price and it says the insurance covered none of it. this is way too much money for me to handle.. i have other upcoming bills from the same hospital totaling to over $20000 if my insurance doesn\u2019t cover any of it. does anyone know if the insurance will cover some of the costs after i\u2019ve been billed? fuck i\u2019m so scared i\u2019m already in massive debt i\u2019m a college student i can\u2019t afford to pay 20 grand for literally just two nights in the hospital\u2026. if i end up having to pay all of it i will seriously kill myself and make sure it succeeds this time",

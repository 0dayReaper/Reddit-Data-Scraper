My younger brother &amp; my niece ghosted me after it turned out Mom left me the bulk of what little money she had. This meant I also was not able to see my 3 month old Great Nephew. He turned 1 yesterday. I was not invited to the party. I basically lost everyone except my husband, son and older brother.  My heart is broken.",

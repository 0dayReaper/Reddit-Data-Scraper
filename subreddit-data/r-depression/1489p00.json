    "postText": "The beginning of last year I was a successful business owner. Made a lot of money but my work is highly stressful. Fast forward to this year - I put myself in a situation where I got kidnapped in Mexico and I'm depressed and sure I ruined my life.  \n\n\nIn March last year I find out my now ex-wife was cheating on me with a co-worker. For months I tried to make the relationship work but I found out later she is a narc. She tried to sleep with my friends and for months I was stressed out every day with my day-to-day work and trying to save my marriage. She tried to get her boyfriend to kick my ass at a Planet Fitness Parking lot.  \n\n\nShe kept seeing him over and over again after. I was able to finally get her out of the house and got divorced. It was a very, very painful experience and honestly I cried myself to sleep every night over it because I loved the woman. We got married young, I was 20. I'm 29 now. But I thought she was the one, but she emotionally, mentally, and financially abused me for years and I was a sucker.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, my parents of 30+ years got divorced the same month I did. It's been a heart breaking journey for them and my family since 2020. It's strange we got divorced the same month.  \n\n\nThen shit starting spirling. I spent all my money on dopamine pleasures. I took a tinder girl I barely knew on a world-wide trip. It was a nice distraction but I knew half way in that I was heading down into a financial abyss. Spending all my Credit and not giving a damn. Everything went on a card. It was totally irresponsible.  \n\n\nEarlier in the year I invested close to $150,000 on something that turned out to be a dud. Then I used my CCs and maxed out everything on this trip plus a Vegas trip right after. I got scammed for $7,000 at a strip club and got messed up.  \n\n\nThe girl and I broke up on bad terms. I then started a string of dating abusive women and got taken advantage of - mostly because I flaunted my past wealth (which was no longer the case). I attracted the wrong type of people and the common denominator in all of this is ME.  \n\n\nSince then, I've been spending all of my money on Alcohol, Drugs, Hookers, Strippers while barely having enough to make payroll and my mortgage. I'm behind on all of my credit cards, creditors, spousal support, and now I got negatives in my personal &amp; business checking and I got payroll this week.  \n\n\nI got kidnapped in Mexico a couple days ago, but it's basically my fault. I have a hernia and thought I could get it taken care of in Mexico. I went to Puerto Vallarta, but upon landing - I had the brilliant idea of partying hard. Went to a brothel and spent $100s of dollars which is a lot in Mexico on a prostitute plus overpriced drinks that were actually club sodas for the girls. I then gambled $500 at a casino. Afterwards, I went to a strip club and spent $3,000 on hookers, drugs, VIP bottled service, and got my ID and Bank information stolen. I was in that VIP room for hours with 4 strippers/hookers. I was living in fantasy land and honestly it was the funnest thing I probably every did in my life...in the moment at least as it was an escape from reality and the horrible shit that was to come. I then woke up in a sketchy motel outside the city and the gate was locked so I was trapped. They were trying to extort more money from me. I was able to escape using violence and ran 15-20 miles back to my actual Hotel with only 20 pesos to my name. 5 miles in I stopped at a gas station and got a big thing of water and downed it all as I hobbled my way back to the hotel.  \n\n\nI called my parents and they flew me home. I was suppose to get treatment in Mexico from a private hospital, but within one day I blew through everything and was being targeted by probably the cartel or something. I signed all the receipts they were charging me and there is video of me doing some things so no way I'm getting that money back.  \n\n\nSo here I am, back at home. Behind on all bills and a looming payroll ahead of me. I think I'll make payroll but barely.  \n\n\nI know I'm being 100% irresponsible and today was my first realization that I needed help help. Like medication, probably rehab. I'm very depressed, anxious, bipolar, etc. I think I finally snapped and hit rock bottom.   \n\n\nI have a long road ahead of me, but it's so daunting I don't even know where to begin. I'm broke, mentally ill, irresponsible, etc.  \n\n\nThe only thing I know that's going for me is I have a great support network of disappointed friends &amp; family who are helping me. I also know how to do sales and make good money but I feel so overwhelmed to tap into my past skillset and potential. I'm frightened by the future and the consequences that are soon to hit.   \n\n\nI'm worried I'm gonna have to start all over, but if I don't get the right care I'll just be right back to where I am. I'm very, very scared and disappointed in myself. I made a lot of mistakes and I feel like I've done enough that my downfall in near and nothing I do will help.  \n\n\nI'm not suicidal, but everything sucks. And I only have myself to blame.   \n\n\nTLDR; Made a shit load of bad choices starting last year and now I'm screwed &amp; depressed. What the hell am I going to do?",

    "postText": "I cant with life. Its too much. I am 17, I live alone. I have so many mental issues and I am starting to realize I am just to weak to fulfill my goals and the horrible life I am living probably means I am not meant to go where I thought I wanted to. I have always wanted to be a doctor, I made sure it was for me, but I am not good at science or anything for that matter. The more I try, the more disappointed I become. Instead of going through hell, and trying to become something I am not, if I am not going to go far in my education I would rather not do anything at all. I think I am just going to continue to work at Walmart and maybe become a manager eventually, and live off of that. I am just not good enough to compete with everyone else. I don\u2019t want to be in a spiral of constant disappointment. I have tried, I keep failing. I just want to give up.",

    "postText": "My cat passed on today after a long battle with kidney disease. He had reached the point where he was actually clearly in pain, so it was time. I had him for 16 years. I was 12 years old just entering middle school when he came into my life, now I\u2019m 28. I can\u2019t stop crying. I don\u2019t know what life is like without him. Coming home at the end of the day to see him was genuinely the only thing that made me feel good/excited/happy anymore. It hurts in ways I didn\u2019t think were possible.",

Losing a pet is a huge loss, an unconditional and loving companion.. a source of innocence and joy..  the positivity and love and energy they bring is immeasurable \u2026 it\u2019s unbelievable how our souls get entangled with theirs.. And so dear person, your sense of loss and pain is absolutely understandable. I\u2019m so sorry.. And I wish you lots of love and support. \n\nPlease understand and accept the grief. We tend to fight it.. because we don\u2019t want to feel this hurt and pain.. but understanding that this pain and sadness is reality .. you must also try to honour and recognising the love u two had and the years of happiness he brought to your life by trying to be grateful for what you had. \n\nI found out that spending time at a local shelter to help other animals helped (because when I lost my beloved cat 10 years ago, I was destroyed too.. but I don\u2019t have it in meto have another pet at home). So spending time with those beings of love without the overall commitment helped fill in the empty spaces\u2026",

It breaks my heart. I think it gets harder when you\u2019ve had your pet for a long time. They\u2019re truly apart of your family. I\u2019m sure you gave your kitty a great life and he loved you for that. I wish you healing and peace soon. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

It warms my heart to know your furball was so loved and appreciated, he had someone that cared so much and he even got his own post online. You're a good person. Very good, in fact. The world needs people like you. You're one of the good ones and this place is better with you in it. \n\nYou took his pain and made it yours. Your little friend didn't have to suffer, because you had his back. Maybe adopting a little homeless furball would help? Not right now, but eventually. You're not replacing your old mate, but honouring his memory offering all the riches he had in life to a kitty in need. \n\nBig hugs. I would like to see a picture of him, if that's something you feel like doing. Thinking of you.",

I didn't expect to able to feel the same kind of love towards this new one but I couldn't have been more wrong. The new boy made me feel like he was sent to me by my late dog, who couldn't stand watching me cry over him down here anymore. If my new dog had a superpower it would be love, because that's what he's drowning me into every day.",

Death doesn't take it away. Embrace the death of it as an even stronger drive to do things in live. That your pet didn't die for nothing. It didn't die to see you grieve. It lived beside you to see you become the human you want to be. And it died to see that. They are in a better place, watching you rn grieving, which they don't wanna see at all.",

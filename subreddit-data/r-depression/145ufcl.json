    "postText": "I keep going back and forth from wanting to try to improve things in my life and feeling hopeless and disgusted with everyone and everything including myself. I feel like a broken record, everything I say is something I've already said before. I have no new thoughts. Everyone feels so inaccessible they might as well be one another planet. I wish I could make peace with being alone but all I ever seem to feel is pain because of it as dumb as it may sound. It's like the desire for the loneliness to end is so great it consumes everything else. Nobody I've ever talked to believes there can be such a thing as not wanting anything or having no dreams or ambitions but that really is how I feel. I never knew what to do with my life before so I don't think I will now.",

            "comment": "Having the strength to keep going, to keep putting one foot in front of the other is a Herculean effort. No wonder there's no room to think anything new when all you're trying to do is survive. To have that basic human connection fulfilled that so many others take for granted. Most people will never understand since they've got the room to think for something greater, and for that I envy them. I understand you.\n\nIn your own way, you're trying to improve yourself. So what if there's nothing new to think? You don't want to be alone. If you recontextualize that thought it can be a goal/ambition. I don't want to speak for you, but it sounds like a goal to me, and a very understandable one at that. I am sorry that your peers don't get that, perhaps because they've never had to go without. To view your want to not be alone as an ambition seems just right. It might be consuming you, but that also means you've never lost sight of what you want. This internet stranger is proud of your drive.\n\nEven if you don't know what to do with your life, it sounds like you deep down know what you want for yourself. And for people like us balancing our whole psyche and existence to make it to the next day, it is enough.\n\nSorry if that stream-of-consciousness didn't make much sense. I'm rooting for you.",

You can't just connect with someone over nothing, just for the sake of it. Or at least I don't think you can.",

You can't connect with someone over nothing, and it's just a mess trying to find what exactly can be your inroad to make a friend. I am sure that down there somewhere there's a hobby or interest that you're passionate about that would be your ticket in, but it's hard to think about that when your mind is consumed by wanting a connection. You are valid, and I sympathize with you. I hope you're able to get to a state where you can express those interests once again to others.\n\nI guess I still have that naive hope that some extrovert will come adopt me and everything will be fixed. Naive as it is, I hope the same for you. It's okay to dream a little bit, right?",

    "postText": "I have a friend that I've known for some time and we talk everyday and we enjoy each other's company, but everyday day or so he tells me that he's practically given up on life and nothing interests him anymore while that no one can ever help him and hearing him say that hurts because I know he's felt this way for quite a while and because he everything that happened in his past led up to this and he didn't deserve it. I just wish there was something I could to soothe his pain once in a while or help him but I know that I alone can't do anything so I am just stuck listening to him in pain. This is mainly a vent post as he's been telling me this for some time",

They've told me that they would not go before because he thinks they don't help and no one will understand what he had to go through so I have been cautious at suggesting it",

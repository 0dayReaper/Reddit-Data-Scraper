On one side you have mania, on the other you have the depression and it's about finding that sweet-spot, the balance to keep walking the tightrope.\n\nI'd like to think maybe at some point in my life, whenever I am correctly medicated or have been taught the best tools for me to handle what is becoming a chronic depression, that I can walk that tightrope between my depressive episodes and my numbness and that I can live with some semblance of quality of life.\n\nI hope and dream for the same thing for all of us who suffer from mental illness, because fuck if we don't all deserve a break from it..",

I honestly wonder what it would feel like to not hope for some quick and easy natural death to occur each time I go to sleep. \n\nI take my few teaspoons of contentment as I manage my depression the best I can.

I'm not in any way qualified to give advice, so just take this as me writing out loud.\n\nCoping mechanisms are not about distracting yourself. The best coping mechanisms allow you to feel your emotions fully, accept your thoughts as they are, and move past them.\n\nIt sounds like you think too much. Do you know that you don't have to think at all? At least, not in any given moment. Chances are, 99% or more of your thoughts are useless, and most are probably damaging.\n\nIt might sound inconceivable to you now, but with practice you can learn to stop thinking almost on command, or at the very least to detach and observe your thoughts almost as if from an outside perspective.\n\nNot only does this bring incredible relief, but it can allow you to view the contents of your mind impartially, and often the simple act of doing so dissolves those deeply ingrained thought patterns. The synapses devoted to negative habitual thinking in your brain have probably been strengthened over years, but you can rewire them in time.\n\nLet me reiterate that I'm not giving you advice. I don't have any clue what is going on in your life, how you feel, or what you're up against. Maybe what I have to say doesn't apply to you at all.\n\nBut in the past I would have written a post exactly like that and I don't feel that way anymore. Meditation totally changed my life, and it doesn't need to be remotely spiritual to work. Once I learned to see my mind without being so emotionally tied up in my own thoughts, my very relationship with them changed.\n\nI still have those negative thoughts, but now they don't bother me anywhere near as much, and since I've learned to let them be and accept them instead of engaging with them, they don't persist, or spiral out of control. I still struggle with anxiety and depression sometimes, but I went from totally non-functional to living a relatively normal life.\n\nOnce you learn to let your thoughts go, you can rest in the space between thoughts. With practice these gaps get larger and larger until you can exist in a state of no-thought at length.\n\nIn the stillness of not thinking, genuine happiness naturally arises, and begins to bleed over into the rest of your life. Don't take my word for it. If you feel up to it, go find out for yourself.",

I'm not an expert so if any of this sounds familiar please go and see a professional and please be aware that depression can be episodic too. It's fairly normal to have ups and downs.\n\nType 1 is characterised by mania. Although a lot of people with Type 1 do swing between depression and mania not everyone gets the depression side. Mania can include a euphoric feeling, incontrollable excitement, a feeling of being indestructable, a feeling of being better at everything, racing thoughts, high confidence. Probably things I'm forgetting too. Ways this might manifest is extreme chattiness, high activity levels, a lack of responsibility with money, less sleep. It is very recognisable in other people if you know what to look for. \n\nType 2 never reaches full-blown mania but is characterised by both depression and hypomania. Hypomania tends to last for shorter time periods and be less extreme than mania. The symptoms are however similar. But it is different from feeling happy and can still come with a feeling that you're not in control of yourself.\n\nCyclothmia is where your symptoms are not extreme enough to receive a bipolar diagnosis. \n\nLast is rapid cycling which isn't a seperate diagnosis in itself, it just means that you've experienced at least four episodes within a year. In other words your mood can change fairly rapidly - sometimes hourly. I'm not sure how common it would be to be that extreme but it does happen.\n\nIt is common to have stable moods between these episodes. There's also a thing where you'll be both manic and depressive at the same time - this is called a mixed episode. \n\nMy advice is that if you think you may have more than depression to keep a mood diary. Hell, even if you think you might just have depression a mood diary can help you identify triggers (if any exist).",

I don't want to put a degree of severity on it, because I'm not a doctor I just suffer with my own mental issues. I can definitely recognise some of what you feel from my own daily life.\n\nDepression can definitely be considered a spectrum!",

Look at that kid; I will never have children and I will die alone.\"  Hyperventilated until I had tunnel vision, forgot half of my list and bought some random crap. Broke into a nervous sweat too.  Just a gross sweaty fat dude wandering around gasping for air.\n\nGot home just in time to wretch. Had to take meds and and an inhaler just to stop the panic attacks and be able to breath. Then slept for eight hours in the middle of the day and have now ruined my sleep schedule going forward. I did manage not to cry in public again though, and I consider that a win.  The trick is to turn you emotions into psychological pain, easier to deal with.  Short term anyway, it'll get you home without embarrassing yourself. Though you'll pay for it later, at least it will be in private.\n\nBut, yeah.  Life has been getting worse with time.  Smaller and shittier apartments.  More and more existential dread, Ever cheaper possessions that barely work.  Fear for my future, can't hold down a job, and my relatives are all getting older and closer to death.  When they go I will be entirely alone, and maybe homeless, because if I can't go to Wal-Mart without having a massive panic attack, how TF am I supposed to work, pay rent etc?   If you don't make money for someone, you might as well be dead as far as society gives a shit.\n\n**TL;DR** Things get shittier and shittier.  It seems that this is a correct assumption.\n\nSorry for the rant, I just feel like shit. Always remember that tomorrow is another day.",

Couldn\u2019t point to one thing but it generally was changing up a few things that helped. Better diet (cooking more). More exercise. Trying to get things done before they need to be instead of leaving it all to the last minute. Working a bit less and expecting less from work. Spending more time around family (and letting it go when they are annoying) last year or so has been really shitty for everyone I hope you will find what you need to make things better.",

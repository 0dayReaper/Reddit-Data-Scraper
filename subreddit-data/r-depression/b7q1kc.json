    "postText": "I was depressed, failing school, etc and I decided I should do my homework at a coffee shop one day. I went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if I wanted to join the rewards program and I was really craving community at this point and I was super excited. \nI kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. \nI found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses. \nA two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have",

Coffee shops are nice because you *can* be social, but you don\u2019t have to be. \n\nI\u2019ve been going to a local coffee shop sporadically over the past year, whether it\u2019s to work on art or homework. I haven\u2019t built any lasting connections, but it\u2019s often one of my only ways to get out of my apartment. ",

I wore sunglasses to keep the red eyes covered and even if the tears sprang, I wiped them and stayed. Smiles from others helped and I made it a goal to compliment others about something. Helping others smile or feel good really helped me feel better too.",

            "comment": "When I was in high school (and very much so depressed), I\u2019d walk the hallways and question my existence. One day I was put in an art class, i wanted to switch immediately, but they said all the other electives were full. I ended up really liking art, so much so that I\u2019d finish my projects so early that my teacher had to give me extra assignments to stay busy. \n\nEventually, he got sick of doing extra work and knew they needed more people on the yearbook crew as there was a new teacher for it, so he asked me to go talk to her. I was generally really depressed and didn\u2019t even realize it was helping, and I definitely didn\u2019t want to be on the yearbook team. It was too much pressure as I was slowly backing out of life (i didn\u2019t figure that part out until I finally got help for my depression and diagnosed it all).\n\nAnyway, he\u2019d send me every day and I\u2019d say she wasn\u2019t there or couldn\u2019t talk, when really I was just walking in a big circle with the hall pass. I figured if he hadn\u2019t given up already he never would so I went and talked to her so unenthusiastically that you could tell she also wanted nothing to do with me. But, she was a new teacher so brought me on with my glowing recommendation, as she was trying to be on people\u2019s good side. \n\nLong story shot, I ended up being the editor-in-chief of the yearbook as well as several section editors over the years and won an award. I was even a yearbook camp councilor the year after i graduated. \n\nThe point is, sometimes you don\u2019t know where you fit in the world and while it\u2019s really *hard* and i still suffer with depression, you sometimes have to step out of your norm and have enough time to look back and appreciate what each thing has done to help you.\n\nI\u2019m glad you found some of it, keep your blinders off as long as you can :)",

I like being a regular and being pleasantly greeted (even if it's their jobs) at several coffee shops in town, but just maintaining this routine of grabbing coffee alone or with a friend kind of kept me from wallowing away - if I stuck to something consistent I'd be okay. Or maybe it was my coffee addiction (or both!) but, it was a positive and has always remained one to keep me going lately. The little things matter. ",

I relate so much to this  especially when I was in college my second batch of friends ended up being a fake one again and took away my one genuine friend with them. Needless to say, I was super happy whenever I visit the coffee shop I'm a regular at and I could be friendly or be myself whenever I wanted without being judged. Sometimes I'd be shy and quiet and that's okay, other times I'm chatty and upbeat, and that's also okay (it's not better, nor less) and i just really love that. Even though I found a new, smaller set of genuine friends,  nothing replaces the comfort I get of being me. I don't force myself to talk and be upbeat at all. So I'm glad you got through your dark days and are getting better now! A cup of coffee (or any drink you prefer) can actually make a difference. Thank you for sharing your story~ It cheered me up again \u2661",

Im a huge people watcher lol but I never even thought about sliding into a conversation or answering a question I may overheard. It's such an interesting approach because I was always taught to mind your business and to never interrupt a conversation. It's also interesting that you got a positive response from being polite. I'm polite all the time but I always get 'is it a he or she mysterious person\". I really don't know how to get past that no matter how many conversations I have. I'll introduce myself many times yet still have my name pronounced wrong even if I've told that person my name many times. I guess my point and my question is how do I get past the conversation part? I'm a great conversation starter and I can talk to someone for hours and yet still be forgotten. Especially if I'm in an environment that I go to a lot like the gym or this little cafe that I do my homework. It's honestly very frustrating and I'm trying my best not to give up on people.",

My city is full of people who don't like to talk to strangers, everyone is so stressed out it's prob the reason why my depression may be sociological. I grew up in a town where life is seen as all about school to college then work all day till death with a family. You have to follow the norm to pursue a degree in a high demanding category like medical in order to feel successful. I was miserable at college as I found nothing after years of discovering. That struggle only pushed me to the edge of suicide. My willpower to just live life doing what I love while not giving a shit about anyone who sees me as a failure (my family and co workers). I only have an interest in musical arts and nature. All I do is work part time in a job I absolutely hate ( but so hard to get into another job) while playing my violin and taking nature walks listening to my favorite music tracks in my spare time. Once I reach to that point where I am kicked out of the house. Ill just use all my saved up money and go on my bucket list and just end it right there. I don't want to live in thks pursuit of the \"american dream\", which is nothing to me. ",

    "postText": "I feel like a fucking alchoholic and it's worrying me. I went almost 28 years of my life not drinking ANY alcohol.\r  \n\r  \nWell, I am 31 now and for the past year I have become in the habit of having 1-2 beers about 5ish days of the week, usually 7-9% IPAs as well.\r  \n\r  \nI've never been drunk before and will randomly take a day or 2 break. But I do enjoy the buzz and feeling it gives me.\r  \n\r  \nIt concerns me because even the 2 beers isn't feeling as intense. Before I would drink 1 Blue Moon and REALLY feel a strong buzz. Now I need 2, and today...I drank 3 7% IPAs for the first time. I AM STOPPING NOW!\r  \n\r  \nHow fucked I am?",

You do build tolerances, but just monitor that. A lot of people who come into my stores usually will buy a single beer or three so they won't drink anything else that night. \n\nTake care OP.

    "postText": "So this is kind of hard to write but I can\u2019t be the only feeling as if everything is shit one moment and the 10 minutes later it\u2019s awesome and then the next it\u2019s shit again? \n\nEveryone leaves me and I\u2019ve gotten so scared of other people that I\u2019ll just ghost some simply out of fear or disinterest because something was bad and then everything is bad? \n\nI also started a job I had last year but quit because of bad pay, then I just a week ago started the same one again and now I want to quit again and hate it even more? I\u2019m also studying and working another job so I feel extremely stressed but I also desperately need the money. \n\nMultiple times a day I fantasize and long for de***h but when I want to do it I\u2019m too scared? Like I\u2019ll sit there and be all like i can take these \ud83d\udc8a or just jump or sum and then I\u2019m like but if I survive and the consequences? So I just live in my own suffering of thinking everyone hates me which they do! Because I don\u2019t get social cues and I don\u2019t know how to social but I do have a personality just not like the standard? \n\nIt\u2019s getting really tough and all I want is someone who actually likes me? But in this society no one wants that? And yea I\u2019m picky I don\u2019t wanna have to stick a bag over your head , attraction is important!\n\nHow come everyone wants casual like that\u2019s so degrading of a humans value euw. Having a bc the same as your age youre basically damaged goods. \n\nAnd if not through a dating app then how do you get new friends and so? Like I\u2019ll try and be social or strike a convo w someone and they look at you like you just insulted them and their entire family? \n\nIs all this because I\u2019m bigger? Am I ugly? I can\u2019t be tho, so is my presence bad? Is my voice bad? They say love yourself but all I can do is go between YAY and no\u2026. \n\nI swear it I can\u2019t go on like this nothing has meaning and I don\u2019t even look forward to things as often and much as I once did. Each year that passes I get more and more dull. I\u2019d like to blame it on things I\u2019ve lived through and myself and people and society but there is always someone who has it worse so i should just shut up right? \n\nPlease help I feel very very lost\u2026.",

And yeah dating is hard but I hope you haven\u2019t been tricked or used! I\u2019m not too ugly so if I want someone I can have em but only for casual when it comes to a relationships or actual dating well then it\u2019s a problem. Sucks so hard. As it feels nice I\u2019m not alone I\u2019m so sorry others feel like this as where I\u2019m in actual physical pain due to my mental issues.",

It really sucks so I guess it doesn\u2019t even matter if your pretty or not you get fucked over for being real anyway. I go in attraction as in smell and feeling and aura not necessarily looks but mental and physical stimulation of someone\u2019s presence sounds odd I know but it\u2019s been real tough finding someone that\u2019s okay recently since everyone just wants to fuck anything that has a hole.

But when you choose to have sex that seals the deal that\u2019s you person and you are theirs it\u2019s like a part of a pussle. Listen if you can have sex with anyone then no one becomes special shit you might as well fuck your friends too because there\u2019s no such thing as a private intimate special relationship or having a SO and SIGNIFICANT other jeez sorry im just so tired of what\u2019s come of the world m.

But it doesn\u2019t have to be the focal point of the relationship and that is where most relationships are tested because do you like this person because they sleep with you or do you like them for their personality, their time, their company, their empathy, the willingness to listen and respond to what you say not just to have a preconceived response in mind but someone that actually is actively listening to you. There is a difference between relationships that are fueled by physical attraction and relationships in which two souls have bonded with one another on an emotional and mental level and I feel like a lot of people don\u2019t readily understand that concept.",

Someone who knows what they want and isn\u2019t afraid to go after it whatever it may be. That is how you exude confidence which is pretty rare these days especially in women. I am picky with potential partners, I\u2019ve turned down a fair share of women because if they can\u2019t match my energy it\u2019s not going to work out. Like I said, there has to be that emotional and mental connection to be established, it\u2019s like an energy where you just feel it with the other person or you may feel the energy doesn\u2019t match up. \n\nCommitment is something I never had an issue with but it\u2019s my trust that I guard like a Doberman. I had 2 relationships the first lasted 2 years and the 2nd was 9 months, both were bad experiences however what I learned from those experiences was the qualities that I\u2019m looking for in someone. \n\nIt helped me learn more about myself as to what I want in a potential partner so I\u2019m not willing to just settle with anyone. It has to be done right and taken slow because I\u2019ll be damned if I give another person my heart just to crush it. I\u2019m not in the business of wasting time, my time and my efforts has been wasted on people that didn\u2019t deserve me, who didn\u2019t appreciate what I did for them, the things I gave them, the attention and love I gave them, etc. \n\nI know my worth and I know what I have to offer. I\u2019m intelligent, I have a decent job and while I may have some flaws who doesn\u2019t? No one is perfect and if someone is point me in their direction. We\u2019re all only human. We have feelings, we have needs, and what brings us together is empathy. The ability to relate to another individual and understand them intrinsically is a value that has no price. Something that we often take for granted in this age.",

I had a 4 year long relationship that comepleteky destroyed me. I mean I\u2019m quite a handful with my bpd and the issues that come with being kind of obsessive but he was also a narcissist and a manipulator so when I realized my own and his faults I gave up and left. That\u2019s also why I\u2019ve kicked so many people out of my life because they\u2019ve been time consuming or energy stealing and I can\u2019t deal with that at this age.

It was a behavior that I had not recognized in myself until giving thought to it but once I realized the pattern it became clear to me. I think I may be bipolar on top of everything else\n\nAlso I completely understand in regards to the dating scene as it has devolved with the internet. I\u2019m the kind of person where I need to get to know someone, I need to have a connection with them to make sure we both understand one another. I don\u2019t necessarily want to do the dating app thing because those apps are infested with degenerates who just want sex and for me a 27M I\u2019m looking for something more than a casual fling, my biological clock is ticking and I want to find someone who I can have a genuine relationship with who understands me and who is willing to work towards building that relationship from the foundation but all I seem to come across are people that are not willing to build something together, people that are highly inpatient and want everything here and now without having the means, the funds, or resources to go about obtaining those things. \n\nMy ex wanted kids and an apartment and she was 21 when I was 23!!! I tell her that it\u2019s not the smart move and we should wait and save our money but she was just so impatient and ended up leaving me for someone else ! People are Insane !! I\u2019ve been alone now for nearly 5 years come November \ud83d\ude1e I\u2019m starved for affection and the crazy part is that I\u2019m not interested in the sex ! Sex is just a bonus but what I really really crave is just someone to look me in the eye and understand me, I crave holding hands, I crave cuddles, soft kisses, hugs. I just want to be loved by someone and I feel that\u2019s way too much to ask for in this fucked up world today of casual one night stands and hook up culture. \n\nWhere is the love? Where is the bonding? No emotions, no connection, no meaning. Are we even alive? Or just fulfilling bodily autonomous needs as if we\u2019re on auto pilot?",

It\u2019s exactly as you describe and personally sex is nice I don\u2019t care when it happens but it\u2019s to be part of a relationship nothing else, as a girl at 19 I feel so alone. I just want the intimacy and privacy of calling someone mine and know that I am theirs in the same way. I don\u2019t just want the sex but I want the feeling of being needed and in belonging, I want to know I\u2019m loved and not just some girl. I know how you feel it\u2019s hard I also want the special things that matter as in the holding hands, physical touch, hugs kisses and just laying or being near someone in a genuine true feeling not just a bodily need. But today everything is just about use or be used. And that fucking hurts I don\u2019t want a future if it\u2019s this cold and deranged , I might as well u u hinge and do as I feel and please no one does care? So why should I and why should you?

Like if stress is bad the sads gotta be BAD bad. Literally she\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m even eating today (cereal/ramen but ig better than nothing) cuz I just wanna dissolve into a puddle of my own tears all alone so I can\u2019t be a burden to anyone else by involving them",

But take one thing at a time and plan and sort things out. But first and foremost accept. Feel angry? Shout kick scream, feel sad? Well cry a damn river! And if you feel happy laugh and indulge in the feeling. Don\u2019t forget to accept you feelings and direct them outwards you have a husband so don\u2019t forget to talk about all the matters no matter the size of them. I know that\u2019s a lot and difficult but it really can help. And as for the baby. Make sure the future for your child is bright. And don\u2019t forget to care for yourself as well. You ate something awesome! Eat again! Not now? Then tomorrow just don\u2019t stop trying even if it feels useless and even if you feel shitty. See you ate because you have a child so you have care so know that you are capable!",

I also no longer have any friends nobody texts me anymore and in the constant thought of \u201cam I ugly?\u201d,\u201dwill I ever get a partner\u201d and I just can\u2019t love myself. I\u2019ve also tried eating every single pill I can find but yeah it didn\u2019t work lol. Also tried strangling myself and my head hurts after a bit so I chickened out and apparently I could get brain damage. I want to jump but too scared so yeah I\u2019m still here. I also don\u2019t really understand social cues, so what I do is just stay silent and wait for someone to talk to me, rather than start an awkward conversation. Some become friends,some don\u2019t but I just can\u2019t retain them because it\u2019s too overwhelming. I\u2019ve gotten used to the loneliness by now but it still gets me sometimes. I also feel lost, I just can\u2019t find the answers\u2026\n\nBut hey OP just wanna let you know that you\u2019re definitely not alone in this and your pain is very much valid and real. I\u2019m very sorry that you have to go through this.",

The customer shit sucks but at least your not in home care having to wipe old peoples asses god damn do I regret going back, I\u2019m gonna quit this job I just can\u2019t take the stress and repulsiveness. But then again if I don\u2019t work how the hell am I gonna sustain myself and my cat? I want to die so fucking bad I even had to dig my nails into my own flesh to keep myself from crying in the register today (I have two jobs, store worker and home care assistant and I study to be an understudy nurse at the same time) but I feel so broken I only have two friends and I swear theyre tired of my shit so I won\u2019t reach out anymore, my parents have no empathy they just say \u201cyou\u2019re your own problem\u201d and that I am complex and make things hard for myself. Sure but I\u2019ve known nothing else no person wants to help and the health care system in Sweden says if you\u2019re not dying I can\u2019t help. I had this girl who was a friend and kind of s situationship and then one day she just never talked to me again it\u2019s like I don\u2019t exist to her and I got scared and thought she killed herself so I send messages every where and tried to call her, then a couple of days later I saw she liked a post on an account we both follow so she totally ghosted me without ghosting me. When u was younger a close friend ditched me for a popular girl so she could get to her crush. My ex lied to me all the time and he also ditched me for his friends ever time was able to. My latest crush was seriously my hope in life we had almost e trying in common and such good chemistry and now he won\u2019t talk to me ever so I\u2019ll have to remove him too. Other guys have just tricked me into having sex or similar and then left me. I feel so broken and I can\u2019t ever trust anything or anyone ever again. Is life supposed to be like this if so? Then fuck it I\u2019ll kill every single person everyone is a fucking asshole fraud selfish and rude just die already. Okay that\u2019s dramatic but if someone told me the world was gonna end I\u2019d only care about my mom and the cats. Everything else can burn. You know what the worst part is? I was the nicest happiest sweetest girl who loved everything and everyone when I grew up and now I\u2019m a quiet person filled with pain and rage. It hurts so fucking bad. I want to suicide but I feel guilty my parents did spend so many years to make a child as good as they probably could, my mom would be heartbroken I am the only kid so. And my cat where would my cat go? I feel selfish wanting to die. But I can\u2019t go on feeling like my soul is on fire trying to kill me inside out. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m in a ball of grease and my vision ability to speak and hear and everything just dims out. I can\u2019t work in that state and it happens to often. I\u2019ve tried pills too one made me gain 20 kgs and the rest just didn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s just placebo. I want to jump but what if I survive what if it hurts, I want to take pills but what if I survive and am in severe pain what if my organs get damaged but I still live? There\u2019s so much I could do but I\u2019m a fucking pussy okay? But I\u2019m also useless and should be dead. If you feel all this too I\u2019m so so so sorry I don\u2019t want anyone to feel like this!",

Everything in life feels like it's against me, and I feel like I have all this pent up rage waiting for it to burst. It just hurts too much to live at this point.

I have two rules to get me through the bad times: 1) Make no decisions when tired that cannot be unmade when rested. 2) Do not kill yourself when you're miserable; you deserve for your last day to be a happy one. This is the miserable time. This is where you get whatever you consider comfort. Curl up in a blanket burrito, drink hot chocolate, eat ice cream, watch your favorite movie for the eighteenth time, find a puppy to snuggle. Whatever it takes to keep going, one day at a time, until you're not as miserable anymore. Even with depression there are better and worse times, and this is definitely a worse one. I hope it gets better soon.",

This period from extreme low to getting better is the most dangerous part, if something negative happens at this point it can be fatal.",

For some, the feeling of getting better and then slipping is too difficult to deal with; to the point of suicide. But part of getting better is understanding that life is not linear.\n\nI wish I had an app that could draw this, but bear with me for a second.\n\nImagine a graph. On one the horizontal axis is \"Time\" on the vertical axis is \"Happiness\". The title of this graph is \"Life\"\n\nWhether they want to believe it or not, when asked to draw a line that represents how they *perceive* life *should* look like on this graph....most people draw linear lines. Maybe they accept that there are plateaus at the beginning and ends but in the middle most people believe that as time goes on, you should get happier.\n\n\nThis is why depression commonly pops up for people in their 20s. Life moves really fast and when you get to that age, it all becomes real. No more hand holding. No more linear lines of things getting gradually better as you become more independent. The *hope* of linear advancement through life disappears and is replaced with Depression.\n\nYou know what life *really looks like*, on this graph, for every single person on this earth? A damn clusterfuck. You have ups, you have downs, you have sideways, you have upside downs, right side ups. It's a mess...for everyone. Some more than others; some are more fortunate and more wealthy in terms of health and finances...some have access to better opportunities than others; better luck. \n\n\nBut all in all, even those people have their shitty moments. Nobody goes through life where they dont come across a struggle or challenge, or a low point. Part of coming to grips with Depression and beginning the process of improving your life is realizing that your graph and the graph of the person sitting next to you are not all that different...they are both jagged. They both look like a damn EKG reading.\n\n\nSo if you'd dont want to peruse therapy, that's fine. But it shouldnt be because you're afraid of hitting a new low on your way to hitting a new high. Because thats going to happen in life regardless of what you do.",

It's more to signify that people experience ups and downs and many of them are not contemplating suicide, which was the original concern a few comments above. I'm living proof that you can come out of the darkest moments of your life and turn things around without ever desiring to kill yourself even though you may experience new lows...which I have. Fear of getting better and then worse again shouldnt stop you from getting help, if you need it.\n\nWhy? Because the graph isnt fixable. It cant be fixed by you, or by me, or by any therapist. If you're going to a therapist with the goal of getting \"fixed\" then I think you may have the wrong idea of what a therapist does and I'm not surprised they told you they couldn't help you. I hope you dont find that as rude, I mean it in the most helpful way possible. The therapist cant make you happy. But what they can do, is put you on the right track.\n\nYou can \"fix\" what you are doing in life but you cant \"fix\" the graph. You are always going to have highs and lows. In never becomes linear for anyone. Making that realization is super difficult and for some...too much. But for others, it can actually be quite liberating.\n\nMy suggestion is try therapy one last time but have a goal that is *realistic.*\n\n\"I want to be satisfied and happy forever from this day forward\" is something nobody can promise and therefore, nobody can help you achieve.\n\nIf you are currently out of work \"help me plan and get through being motivated to get a job\"\n\nIf you are lonely, \"i need help  confident and motivated to put myself out there\"\n\nThese are things in your life that a therapist CAN help you achieve and will also make you feel better about yourself when you achieve them. But only you can do that yourself...which brings me to my last point (yes I know, I talk a lot lol)\n\n&gt; I mean I can't really do anything to fix myself alone really\n\nWhy not? I mean sure... having a therapist help you come up with positive routines is the part that maybe you cant do on your own...but they cant be in the job interview for you. They cant go out to the bar with you and meet someone new. You've gotta do that by yourself and eventually, when you're ready, you **will** be able to tackle challenges and obstacles on your own if you set the right routines and best practices in place.\n\nI hope this helps",

I just have a hard time grasping onto reality, so pain and destruction upon myself tend to help me truly understand how different the world is, compared to the way society and our big blue ball in space are currently turning.",

Not that either of those things are high right now in my case, but it's still a lot better than it was. \n\nWhat I did was be in a non-energy state for 5 years. Then around 3 months ago I felt somewhat better, then I felt really bad, then I felt better, then I felt really bad, and now I'm feeling better again. I was in each phase for maybe a week or two. Now, when I say 'really bad', I don't mean like I was before - depressed and inactive. I mean  just as depressed but mobile and clear minded, and much closer mentally to actively doing something. I'm guessing those are the dangerous times.\n\nI'm still not out of it yet. I find that my moods are really volatile. Depression is still a problem and now anger is starting to be a problem too. IMO anger is a different side of depression; just active instead of passive. At least I can channel anger into exercise.\n\nSo I am OK right now as I write this, but I feel like I'm not more than a really bad week away from killing myself or harming someone else. Because of that I am really trying to keep my activities low-key and positive right now. Avoiding stress, and other people, as much as possible. Not recommending you stay away from other people ofc. I'm just really introverted and that approach works for me.\n\nI think only you can answer your question for sure though. How do you feel now compared to 4-5 months ago? More motivated? Has this been going on for more than a week or so? And are you getting those same kind of mood swings?",

The bad days don\u2019t seem to go by quicker now though so that\u2019s a good thing. \n\nWhenever I get angry I just walk away from whatever it is that\u2019s upset me and do something that will take my mind off things for 10-20 mins, that really seems to help a lot",

I hit the gym 6x a week and the running track 3x a week. I don't even eat fast food more than once a month. My life is BORING AS FUCK just so I could have as few disturbances as possible to get this fucking degree.\n\nI don't have much motivation left. I don't remember coding commands. If I read something, I'll forget while I'm still reading. My family forbade me to handle glass objects (they bought me plastic cups and everything) cause I was dropping them every day. I can't have a 10-minute conversation without forgetting what I was saying mid-sentence. I can't write essays because I make 2 typos for every word. It's not a matter of lack of motivation: I'm just exhausted and frustrated. Anyone would feel that way, hence why this is not depression. \n\nThe doctor is adamant about diagnosing me as bipolar (despite never having a manic episode), though, which is why he doesn't want me on ADHD meds. For whatever reason, everything I have described him did not catch any of his attention. Even though I had a former ADHD diagnose, it was made by another doctor, so he didn't take into consideration. He even said I correlate strongly with classical ADHD cases, but he is \"confident\" I just need to \"control my thoughts\" and then it will all come naturally back again. All I need to do is wait and keep trying until the inevitable failure happens and it will all be done. I could do it today if only I found a way to convince myself I tried hard enough.",

However, it was worth it in the end as I found a medication that keeps me stable and a GP who has my back - even if I have to wait two months to see her, I won\u2019t see anyone else about my mental health (emergencies aside). I know the saying is meant to be for relationships, but I think it works here too - you have to kiss a few frogs before you find the Prince!

Man, those thoughts are far more intense than my actual down-feelings that could go up anytime.\n\nPersonally, I like to think of the whole situation as a surviving game. Each day I live is a day I won. Just the fact that I wake up and take a breath  is an opportunity given by god, nature or whatever; if you think of all the possibilities that could have you killed, getting hit by a car, choking when eating lunch, having a heart-attack...; The idea is that you're here and that's the important.\n\nThe next thing is what to do. You know, you don't have to save the world or try to change yourself to match your perfect ideal self. That's going from 0 to exponential(1000). That's really dangerous.\n\nWhat you're really need to do; by you I'm addressing myself as well because I am not the master mind here and I am using this post as self-talk note; is something really simple and easy. Make your bed, clean your room, maybe take a shower, doing dishes can be helpful, get yourself a good meal, make an easy one, and yeah, walking 5 min to the groceries store can make miracles.\n\nThe idea here is to stay simple, humble, and not to go full pro. Just do those little incremental success day by day and let the time do its job.\n\nThere also is this idea that I got from a book, 12 rules for life by Jordan B. Peterson, that says you should negotiate with yourself as were talking with someone that works with/for you. You should motivate that person and give him the right reasons to do the job for you.  Instead of saying : \" you should clean you're room you piece of shit ! \", try : \" What you want in exchange for you cleaning this room \". Listen to what he badly wants and make it as reward for the good work. Maybe it sounds a bit crazy, but if you think of it seriously your whole thinking process shifts to the positive side. It can eliminate some of the unnecessary internal fights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWherever you are, I wish you good health and strength.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: typing.",

Start doing shit and you\u2019ll see the difference. I spent hours and hours playing games when I was depressed and I was too afraid to change. In reality, seeking that dopamine in this way will make things worse. Plan out your schedule and complete it, you\u2019ll feel 100x better due to that little accomplishment. You must include:\n\n1. Exercise (serotonin will help you more than dopamine)\n\n2. Work/school (that is something that you have to do. Even if you work at a shitty job, keep at it while you strive for more. I will explain that on number 4)\n\n3. Socialising (talk to your friends, if you don\u2019t have any talk to your family, if you don\u2019t have any go out and meet new people. On the way back home, etc I don\u2019t care)\n\n4. Hobby/ passion. You know yours, now do it. This could become your source of income if you work hard\n\n5. Alone time (ideally to reflect on the day, look at your finance. After that you deserve your games, netflix and youtube)",

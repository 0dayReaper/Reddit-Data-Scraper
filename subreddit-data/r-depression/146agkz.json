    "postText": "I\u2019m extremely tired all of the time, I haven\u2019t showered in two weeks, my room is a mess for far longer and I can\u2019t keep it clean. Every thing that\u2019s supposed to make me happy, makes me even more depressed. I am constantly anxious, I have several anxiety attacks a day, seemingly out of nowhere. Several panic attacks a month. Constant fear of impending doom. I\u2019m also in physical pain, I\u2019ve been limping since I remember. I am extremely depersonalized, I have no fucking idea who I am, who is typing this, who is in the mirror. I\u2019ve been suicidal since forever. I just want all this to end. I hate my mother, but I don\u2019t know why. I have no connection with my family whatsoever, I\u2019m not satisfied with my relationship with my partner, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m capable of being in a relationship. I don\u2019t even have any energy to go buy razor blades, so I can hurt myself. I hate my body, I hate myself. I\u2019m so scared of the pain of suicide. I just want this to end. I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t want to be alive.",

It will sound weird but I get more anxious when the weather, air temperature and air flow is just right, it triggers something in me, some memories probably but I can\u2019t remember anything from my childhood. I am really troubled with nostalgia, but I don\u2019t know what to because I don\u2019t remember anything",

Too many clouds made me feel like the world was ending. Too much sun made it seem like the earth would explode. Therapy did help me learn more about why I felt that way.",

You're just supposed to feel, accept those feelings, try and understand them and be thankful to even be able to feel at all (would you rather be a psychopath?)   \n\nOtherwise the Demons will keep getting louder and louder but it sounds like they already occupy quite a bit of your head at this point",

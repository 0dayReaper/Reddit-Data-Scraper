Guys will fucking play me, act all into me at first, and then flip the script and be like \u201coh srry this ain\u2019t gonna work out, u don\u2019t rlly love me ur just miserable haha bye\u201d (they don\u2019t say that literally but im trying to summarize lol) LIKE WTF?! You knew about my trauma and mental illness from day one! Why even entertain the idea of wanting me if you were just gonna reject me for things outside of my control anyways! Do you know how devastating and invalidating that is? That\u2019s like saying someone with a disability can\u2019t love someone because they\u2019re not \u201cnormal\u201d. Tbh I think the only reason guys do this is because they see girls like me as easy targets. Since I\u2019m mental and I\u2019ve been abused my entire life they think they can just walk all over me, and are surprised when I stand up for myself and don\u2019t allow them to do that. Well, screw you and fuck off\ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffd",

It is hard because unless you have experienced it, you really do not understand what the other person is going through and even then, we all handle things differently. I imagine most of the guys just do not realize what they are unpacking and rush blindly into it. It sucks. \n\nWhats even worse is if you find someone who empathizes and genuinely connects with you, it can be self-destructive for both of you.\n\nStill trying to find the balance in this, but I think finding someone who went through something similar and trying to help each other is the best solution.\n\nCheers.",

The guys also had issues/similar experiences themselves so they would use that factor to comfort me even more in the beginning into believing they were genuine. Tbh only a healthy individual regardless of if they\u2019re mentally ill or not can handle being with someone with these types of issues, because you can definitely be mentally ill AND toxic. Just because you\u2019re mentally ill or have gone through trauma doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a saint or that you can understand it better, sadly a lot of these problems can be a motivating factor for someone to be destructive.",

That's adding generational, educational, maturity, and other issues into an already complicated relationship. Finding a partner at any age is difficult. Adding to it isn't helping you.",

(not you specifically specifically just in general) \n\nI had a group of friends that were very aware about my depression. Another person in the group also suffered heavily but the difference was that he sought help and medication and went to what we jokingly refer to as the loony bin. They saw him try and they saw that I wasn't. \n\nThey confronted me straight up by saying that they can't help me if I don't want to be helped and it kinda opened my eyes after I lost them. \n\nFew months went by and I saw the difference in the way people treated me when they saw that *at least* I was trying, I wasn't magically healed or less sad, but it made the world of a difference in my relationship with other people who don't understand mental illness or didn't have it themselves.\n\nSo I don't know if this applies to your situation or has any relevance, but this is what I had found out in terms of boys, friends and neurotypical people in my life. Saying it is completely and utterly out of your control isn't wrong but it isn't correct either. Change you environment, change your approach to coping, cut people who hurt you out of your life, seek counseling, try different medications until you find the one that works for you. Because trauma victims usually feel like they deserve these things but they don't. \n\nDon't let anyone walk over you, regardless of the state of your mental health\u2764\ufe0f",

I wanted to help but had to learn the hard way that they have to want to get better in the first place, I can't save them on my own. They cut all ties with me and now wanted to come back as if nothing happened, and they hurt me very much without a word of explanation and played the depression card afterward. Now I also got depression as a result of this trauma and some other personal issues, but I sought help and worked really hard to overcome the hardships. I suggested we meet up to talk about what happened and they saw it as an attack on them. It's sad that someone once very dear to me now sees me as a threat. And it's painful that although they hurt me, I am the one trying to fix this. And then get attacked for that. I know they are struggling, I am too. But it does not allow anyone to treat people like trash. I feel helpless.",

Sometimes I can work or study for 12 hrs with out a break.. sometimes I can't leave my bed because I want to end it all.. I don't let anyone close to me but then want to kill myself beacuse I feel lonely. And then the constant thought in my head that I don't need help, that there is nothing wrong with me.. some days I'm more than okay. How can I ever ask for help if I'm not always like this.. I know in few days I will wake up and do all my stuff ahead for weeks and prepear for the next time I can't stand even my own company.. \nSorry for the rant.. feels good to let it out in a way that doesn't include harming myself.",

I usually push them away because i know that i\u2019m not mentally \u201cgood\u201d enough for a relationship, but some are very persistent and just keep asking me over and over what i mean. Then when i begin to feel comfortable and secure around them, it then becomes harder for me to hide my emotions. Why bother using all that energy to put up a fake smile if she loves me right? Nope, it gets flipped back on me and i\u2019m told that she needs a man and \u201cdidn\u2019t sign up for this.\u201d Idk why i get so much unwanted attention but it\u2019s definitely kept me inside a lot more over the years and has developed into anxiety.

Hearing them is a privilege, and we should always ask ourselves this before we share: \"Who has earned the right to hear my story?\" If we have one or two people in our lives who can sit with us and hold space for our shame stories, and love us for our strengths and struggles, we are incredibly lucky. If we have a friend, or small group of friends, or family who embraces our imperfections, vulnerabilities, and power, and fills us with a sense of belonging, we are incredibly lucky.\u201d - Bren\u00e9 Brown. \n\nSo holding that belief is incredibly empowering. Don\u2019t share it until someone has earned the right to hear it! Also don\u2019t go into relationships thinking you\u2019re \u201cbroken\u201d or there\u2019s anything wrong with you. Because there isn\u2019t anything wrong with you. We all have our struggles and go through myriad of mental illnesses and suffer from childhood traumas. ALL \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffdOF \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffdUS! And that\u2019s the beautiful part of being human. Our stories. Our stories make us unique. Don\u2019t think of them as your weakness. So changing that narrative about yourself will help immensely. You won\u2019t go into dates wondering if you\u2019re good enough for them and whether they like you or not. You will go into it knowing you\u2019re amazing and have ALOT to offer and whether they\u2019re good enough for you. \n\nPlus, fuck those guys! They don\u2019t deserve you anyway. From what you\u2019ve described, these guys sound very emotionally immature. You don\u2019t want them. You want someone who can compassionately hold space for you with no judgement and respect your story and all the human flaws of the past and present. Someone who doesn\u2019t love you despite your flaws but they love you because of them. That\u2019s the kind of person you want in your life. And once you have that relationship, you both will help each other grow into the best versions of yourselves.",

But I\u2019m trying to push forward everyday and pick up the pieces. You\u2019re right about those guys being very, VERY immature. With a lot of those experiences I was being groomed, and also I think subconsciously I was trying to heal/soothe my own childhood trauma by trying to make someone that felt familiar to that abuse love and care for me.

We tend to associate ourselves with people who inflict similar kind of abuse because it feels \u201csafe\u201d (oddly enough) and \u201cfamiliar\u201d. I highly recommend checking out YouTube or Instagram of \u201cThe Holistic Psychologist\u201d Dr. Nicole LaPera. She gives a lot of insightful information on healing your inner child and common things that we all go through as humans. \n\n\u201cI have my moments where I feel everything you\u2019re saying and fundamentally at my core I know you\u2019re speaking truth, but doubt and insecurity often times overrides the spotlight. Sometimes the truth feels foreign to someone like me who\u2019s been fed lies their entire life.\u201d\nGirllllll, same! And the funny thing about \u201cknowing\u201d these things is that it isn\u2019t enough. You\u2019ve got to experience feeling worthy on subconscious level. And doubt and insecurity never leaves any of us, we just develop mechanisms to deal with them differently. My recommendation would be to focus on self-love and self-care. This doesn\u2019t always mean bubble baths, but take bubble baths if that\u2019s your thing ;) but also practice meditation, your choice of movement to keep your body in check, journaling and most importantly questioning your inner critique when doubt and insecurity creeps up. Ask that voice why it\u2019s saying those hurtful things. My favourite method of doing that is by journaling. Morning pages! You can do them anytime it doesn\u2019t have to be in the morning. But the idea is to write long form 2-3 pages stream of consciousness (look it up, there are so many resources online). Do it especially when you\u2019re feeling vulnerable and harsh on yourself. Write down the thoughts you\u2019re experiencing and question why you\u2019re thinking them. Be very honest. And keep asking yourself why until you get to the root cause and you will quickly realize that all those \u201cthoughts\u201d are things that your guardians or people throughout your life have said to you. Why? Not because they\u2019re true, but because those adults were going through their own traumas and it unfortunately got projected onto you. They\u2019re not your thoughts, they\u2019re not even true. Why entertain them? And honestly, it\u2019s a lifelong practice. I used to think that once I know these things, I\u2019ll do better. And I didn\u2019t. Because knowing isn\u2019t enough. You have to experience and embody feeling worthy every single day. You have to keep these practices going. Once you develop that deep meaningful bond with yourself by taking care of your mental and physical health. You won\u2019t tolerate bullshit from any of these guys or people in your life. The moment they start disrespecting you and your story, you\u2019d nope out so fast because you know you deserve someone SO much better! \n\nGoodluck! You got this \ud83d\ude04\u2764\ufe0f",

Sometimes people choose not to pursue a friendship ir romantic relationship with ppl who have emotional/mental disorders because it can honestly take a toll on their own emotional well being. That's just the way it is. Ppl need to make choices that are best for them and sometimes that feels like \"discrimination\" but ppl in forums like these often talk about how we need to \"cut off our toxic relationships\" but then say its discrimination when other ppl cut out toxic relationships them. \n\nFor instance: my 10 year old has a friend with attatchment disorders or somthing I think. She gets insabely jealous and angry if my daughter has any other friends or talks to anyone fkse. Its not her fault she has this disorder. But its causing my daughter who is very empathetic and emotiinsl and depressive prone to feel undeserved guilt and lose out on friendships and fun of childhood. We've chosen to distance from her because yes... the relationship is toxic. Its a shame! Its so hard. She deserves love and friendship and her disorders not her fault. But we made the decision to not let it be part of our lives in order to preserve my daughters mental health. Is that descrimination? I wouldn't say so...but its subjective. \ud83d\ude15",

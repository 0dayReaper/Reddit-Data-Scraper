There is constantly one single sentence that keeps playing on loop in my head which is \u201cend it\u201d. It keeps going on and on like a broken record, I can\u2019t eat cause I always feel full, I have to literally force myself to eat, I do not want to do anything heck I don\u2019t even want to get out of bed but I keep pushing, but how much? Until when do I keep forcing myself, when will it end? When will I finally die and not have a brain to process these thoughts anymore. I am sick and tired of living and I just don\u2019t want to anymore, every night I pick a knife put it to my neck and then think \u201clet\u2019s give it another day\u201d.  I just cannot continue anymore",

Everything I do goes wrong or just completely stops, I\u2019ve tried saving up and investing in gold, then I tried saving and investing in selling stuff online. I had to starve myself for days to be able to save, right now feeding stray cats is the only thing keeping me going",

That's a really beautiful thing to do with your time. Do you think you'd ever adopt a kitty? \n\nInvesting in gold as in stock piling or trading? Because trading is pretty dang challenging isn't it? Don't beat yourself up for that not working out. \n\nAre you working right now? Maybe there's something animal-related worth doing? Or even cat sitting? Just random ideas. But there might be something worth doing related to your love of animals",

    "postText": "I never thought in a million fucking years that it would get this bad. I think I'm giving up.  I have become a hollow shell of a human. Having both ADHD and Depression has fucking ruined my fucking life. I have hated myself so much for everything that has happened to me. The only desire I have is to drink myself to death, drink until it kills me, cuz alcohol is the only thing that makes me happy now. My brain is physically incapable of giving me basic amounts of serotonin and dopamine and whatever the fuck else is needed for feeling okay. My answer for everything now is \"I don't know,\" and \"I don't care.\" Something good better happen soon or else I'm afraid I have no choice but to leave this hell. Thank you. ",

    "postText": "It's kind of ironic, isn't it? I'm finally crawling my way back to doing things. I'm 27, taking an online course because I didnt graduate high school or have a job or go to college, hoping this stupid course might save me. I'm learning how to bike, I'm eating healthier, I'm cooking for people. \n\nAnd it all just makes me realize that i have no chance of proceeding forward. This is my peak and I dont have the cushion of being pathetic to cling to anymore.\n\n I'm trying, and that makes me responsible for my failures.\n\nI don't want to die, I dont want to fall back into doing nothing, and I dont want to keep trying. I dont know what else there is but to steal these 3am moments. Treasure them because this is the only time I can lie here, hidden and silent, and not make any choices at all.\n\nJust some thoughts I'm having. Please dont congratulate me on my progress if anyone comments at all; there's no sense of achievement to be found here.",

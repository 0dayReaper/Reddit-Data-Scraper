I\u2019ve completely given up Nobody likes me and nobody ever wants to be my friend \nThe only friend I have is kinda distancing herself from me and everytine i tell someone about it they say I\u2019m overreacting. I\u2019m terrified to loose her she\u2019s the only reason I still live and if she leaves I can\u2019t go on",

    "postText": "Can anyone please talk me down?\n\nWriting this all down is so painful. I feel so numb and I am at a loss of what to do. I met a guy 5 years ago this coming September. I love him, he likes me. He has been upfront about this. We have regularly had sex through out our entire \u201crelationship\u201d if you want to call it that. Idk. Last night, he came over and told me he started to see someone else. He felt a strong connection and that he felt it best that we stop being friends, because we couldn\u2019t just \u201cbe friends\u201d after what we have done over the past 5 years. I am absolutely heartbroken and I feel horrible. I love him with all my heart and I would do anything to be with him. Not only am I losing the guy I love, but also my best friend in the process. I feel so alone and I\u2019m scared to turn to drinking. I haven\u2019t told anyone this except here, I can\u2019t bare the pain of having to tell my other friends who have told me for years to leave this guy. They\u2019ve all been upfront about how they hate him and that he uses me for sex. I\u2019m really unsure of what to do. I just want to not feel this pain. I don\u2019t know how to go on.",

It will take time for you to heal, but you will surely find your happiness within yourself. Nothing is permanent not even the pain you are feeling now. And someday you may think this happened for your good. And you said your friends told you to leave this guy, then I have to think that he was toxic for you in someway. Don't turn in to drinking because of this person who doesn't deserve you, your love, or your precious life, so don't ruin yourself.",

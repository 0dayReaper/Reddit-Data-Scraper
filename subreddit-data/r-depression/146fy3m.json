I just feel heavy all the time I really wanna do good in life but it feels like there\u2019s this huge weight on me. I\u2019ve recently just been able to start going out and doing things \u201cnormally\u201d again to to severe anxiety and panic attacks. I felt like I was getting somewhere with getting a job a starting college again but now this. Any suggestions besides medications.",

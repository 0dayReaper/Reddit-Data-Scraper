I thought there was a girl from my church who might be into me, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just stupidly reading into shit like I normally do. She\u2019s way too pure and too good for someone like me. Super extroverted and kind and fun to be around, and is great at making friends. I\u2019m a shy loser, plus I\u2019m 23 and making janitor money. Idk how much longer I can go on like this",

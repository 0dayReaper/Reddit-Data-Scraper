    "postText": "so I have been with my boyfriend for about 7 months now. he has been very depressed since long before I knew him. sometimes it's a lot worse than other times, though. he has a lot of things stressing him out at the moment, mostly financial, I think. he will often talk about how he should just kill himself or about harming others. he is just in an incredibly dark place. I try to do what I can, I always remind him that I'm here for him with whatever he needs, but it just seems like nothing I do or say makes him feel any better. he just posted on a different subreddit a couple hours ago (he doesn't know I know about his account) about wanting to SH for the first time since he was 12 over a personal matter I was never told about. I'm sad that he feels this way and I especially don't want him to SH, any advice on how I can support him in these hard times would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "I need you to read very carefully. Just being supportive and assuring and there for him is all you can really do. Depression is not something you can just fix. Nor is it your responsibility to fix him, and you are not equipped to do so in the first place. It's very sweet that you want to help, and it's good that you are so supportive and that you can perhaps help them to seek therapy. But that's all you can really do. Be there, be supportive. Beyond thaymt you're responsibilities end.\n\nDepression is incredibly complex, both to diagnose and to treat, and it can take years or may be chronic.\n\nWhat's important! Is that you understand that whatever happens, even though it's your partner. Its not your responsibility to fix them. Nor is it something you can do much about. If something bad happens, it's not your fault. Be careful and mindful of your own mental well-being and needs as well. We want to help those that we care about and it feels horrible feeling helpeless and unable to do much. But taking on the responsibility to fix them can be so detrimental to your own well being and mental health. Dont make that mistake please. Be there for them, but dont loose yourself trying to fix them. You can't and its no one's fault. You can be there for them and be the best partner that you can be in your own capacity. That's it",

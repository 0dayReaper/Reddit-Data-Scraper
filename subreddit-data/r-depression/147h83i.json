    "postText": "Many times in the definition or explanation of depression it includes something along the lines of feeling worthless or hopeless. I know I have depression because I feel sad often and I have been diagnosedwith depression. I know I'm not worthless and I am hopefull it gets better or the best outcome happens. But I'm still sad. I'm curious if others are like me where they don't identify with the worthless and helpless portion?",

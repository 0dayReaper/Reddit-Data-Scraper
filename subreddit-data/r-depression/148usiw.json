    "postText": "Every single day I know that I'm going home to an empty house, a house I never wanted and that I'll never be able to afford to fix. Every year there are less and less people in my life, and at 32 I can't see a future that doesn't include being alone. Everyone I know or knew has their own family, wife children..and they've all left me behind one by one. I try so hard to be a good person, to help people in need, in hopes that the universe will somehow put things into place. Yet the years go by and I'm more and more alone. It's made me realize that there is no point or reason to our lives, the universe does not care what you do or who you are. I have no idea what to do at this point. I try dating but I just end up hurting people because I can't be what they need, or they don't want to be with someone with 1 friend at 32. I've never felt so alone in my life",

I've always been a loner though and I think I lean hard on the scale for staying solo.\n\nLike everyone though, I grew up watching media and witnessing relationships start and being told to one day get married and start a family. The typical indoctrination stuff. That was the normal course of life. When you're young, it sounds like the only one. The inevitable outcome.\n\nThen, you realize how untrue and unrealistic that all is. I firmly believe that maybe 1% of relationships are real love. The rest are people forcing star shapes through square holes failing in relationships over and over and over again. Because they had it hammered into their brains that you grow up, get married, work a career, buy a house, and so on. Its what everyone is suppose to do. You have to do it. This is compounded by society frowning on people that deviate from this path. Being single is bad. Being poor is bad. Having no friends is bad. etc.\n\nThat's why it hurts being alone. We've probably all seen a couple that belongs to that 1% of perfect loving relationships. These 2 people who seem made for each other. 500% compatibility. Been together for years and everyday is like the first. Then we see fantasy relationships in tv shows and movies. \n\nIts a reminding of what could be. What is possible. Something everyone wants. Its like this show that used to be on tv. Homes of the Rich and Famous. Normal people watching a show about mansions and luxurious castles they'll never have. Relationships are similar. You can go your whole life relationship to relationship and never find the right person. Its just dumb random luck. \n\nThere are only 2 things you can do:\n\n1. Stay alone.\n\n2. Get out there as much as you can. Do things. Go places. Attend events. Then hope you bump into the right person.\n\n...or you can do what many do and force a relationship with someone you have no feelings for because that's better than being alone. I wouldn't recommend this one. If something is meant to end, it usually will eventually no matter how much effort you put into staving off that day.",

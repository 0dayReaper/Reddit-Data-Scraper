    "postText": "Hey guys, I was a bit active on this sub a couple years back. Just wanted to let you all know that after 3 years of struggling with depression I have finally went one year without being depressed. It is possible. It might also be worth mentioning some of the ways I decided to improve my life. Just gonna give a list but if people would like me to expand please do reply.\n1. Quit smoking weed.\n2. Started going gym daily, even on the days I felt off.\n3. Changed my diet to reduce processed and high sugar foods.\n4. I practiced self-discipline for a while, this includes but is not limited to no-fap (effective but overhyped imo). \n5. I started a university degree and a new part time job, gonna start a side hustle soon too.\n6. Changed my mindset, have to oversimplify this one but I made the conscious effort to direct my thinking towards accountability and duty.\n7. Reduced my intake of social media and news outlets. It\u2019s honestly predatory and a feedback loop of negativity.\nSome of these overlap but so be it. I want everybody struggling right now to understand that they have the ability to change, and there is always hope.",

I want to cry when I think about it but again, I have no choice except drowning, it's the best way to make people don't think I commit suicide. The fight is over now. One last month for me. My family loves me so much, I want to say I'm sorry but I can't, they will know something is wrong",

Sometimes we're not rational in desperate moments and we only want that *feeling* to stop existing.\n\nI can tell that despite your current feeling, you have reached out here. So part of you has hope.\n\nThere are many people who have experienced feeling the same way. I have been there too. I thought at the moment I wanted to stop existing as well. In truth, I wanted to live, I just didn't want to live in this *feeling*.\n\nI hope you could at least reach out to a supportive therapist to process why you may feel this way.\n\nJust because you may feel this way now, doesn't mean you will always feel this way. There would be no happiness without having lows.\n\nLows are temporary if you wait and see the highs and reach out for help from a support system. It will be the first step to stopping that feeling without harming yourself. I hope this gives some perspective. *You are not alone.*",

I know why I feel this way and I don't think I can feel better when everything is getting worse and worse because of my fault. I'm just a failure. Everything will be better without my existence. Or not. I don't know and I don't care anymore. I will put an end to my life before the end of July, when thing will be the worst. Maybe I'm here because I'm scared of drowning and want to find another way to commit suicide. And thank you, again.",

Everyone has experienced low points in their lives, it's normal to have negative feelings and low points.\n\nNot wanting to live through an *emotion or* *feeling* is very different from not wanting to live.\n\nFrom seeing your responses, I can see you do care a lot. Or why else would it affect you as deeply as it has?\n\nAre you certain that you would still care about this moment 2 years from now? Or do you think this will fade with time as you care about other things? \n\nAre you truly scared of drowning? Or are you scared of not living?",

I haven't found my life worth living for idk, maybe 8-9 years. I didn't commit suicide because I didn't want my family feel sad or guilty or anything and because I know drowning is painful. Now those reasons can't prevent me anymore. Consequence of my fault will follow me for the rest of my life, that's a sure thing, sorry for not giving you detail. I'm so exhausted, I breathe and then I feel guilty because I still breathe. Thus I'm done, one last month, get some absolutely agony moments and then I can go into that good night. Sorry if I make you feel bad with my negative thought. And thank you again, I wish all the best will come to you",

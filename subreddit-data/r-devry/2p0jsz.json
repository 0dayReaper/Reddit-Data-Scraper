    "postText": "I'm interested in doing business at Devry and have a few questions; I'd love to chat with a current student if possible.\n\nA few: how demanding are classes? Do you pick your own schedule or have some kind of cohort? I've heard all textbooks are priced standard, how much do they cost, and are they good? What are the instructors like (in general)? Are there other costs besides tuition and books?\n\nI'd really appreciate any info.  Thanks.",

            "comment": "I am a former instructor and can answer some of these questions.\n\n1. Each class varies in how demanding it will be. As a business student some of your more demanding classes will be business related like Accounting, and Marketing, or perhaps an HR related course depending on your concentration (track).\n\n2. On most campuses you do pick your own schedule. Classes aren't always offered each session though, so speaking to your adviser is important. Most campuses no longer do official cohorts, but it is nice if you can find some friends and take as many classes as possible with that group. It can help, but you aren't forced to do so. I always told my students (and students in orientation) to take control of their own schedule. Use your Student Portal and look at what classes you need and take them as you see fit. Some students want to take all their technical classes first, some want to take English classes back-to-back. It is up to you.\n\n3. Yes typically books are a set price if they are e-books. The price is included in the course enrollment. If it is a printed book, then the price is set by the publisher. Go to the bookstore and see which are printed, then get the UPC and buy online whatever you can. Just be sure there isn't a CD included. Some books have an online portion that you need a code for. A used book will not have this code. Business books are notorious for this (as opposed to technical books).\n\n3. Hmm. I cannot think of any. Just tuition, books, perhaps a bus pass. Insurance will be \"given\" to you unless you refuse it (if you have other insurance). I am sure there is something else in there, but I cannot recall. Speaking to a financial adviser will get this answered correctly.\n\nDeVry is a great school and you get out what you put in to it. DeVry isn't perfect, but I have many, many success stories just from my 12 years of teaching there.",

            "comment": "If you still need someone, I'm a current student. I started while in high school in January 2014 and have been full time since July 2014. Some people complain about loans. It's not like they surprise you; you know the cost up front. If you can't afford it without loans, go somewhere else. I don't have any loans so I have no regrets going. Will keep it up til I graduate in December '16. \n\n1. Classes vary in demand, as /u/jasonhuber mentioned. Some in the beginning are easy, some require several papers, quizzes, tests, projects, etc. \n\n2. Your schedule is whatever you want, and you can go at your own pace. If you are fixed on 'on-campus' classes (as I am), then you might want to talk to your advisor as not everything is offered every session. Online is pretty free-reign. Of course, many classes have pre-requirements. Can't take calculus without algebra, etc.\n\n3. Textbooks all come with the classes, and they are e-books. You can have them printed (black and white, paper bound) for $10. Or you could purchase them online or in store somewhere, as they are real textbooks.\n\n4. I've loved every professor that I've had. They're always super knowledgeable and will get you what you need. They generally reply right away to e-mails (class is just once per week, and they are generally professionals in the field so they are too busy for in-person meetings besides that).\n\n5. As far as costs, here's my [breakdown](http://www.hgpot.com/home/Mar2015.png) for the March-April session:\n\nDescription | Amount\n---|---|----|----\nDeVry Scholarship | $1113 |\nDeVry Tuition | $4263 |\nStudent Services | $20 |\nCourse Material | $80 |\nCourse Mateiral | $80 |\n\n\nSo that's for 2x 4-credit classes, the most that you would take at once. It will be lower at first with the 2- and 3-credit classes. Course Material is the eBooks, Student Services is to pay advisors and whatnot. You can also test out of classes for $5/credit hour.",

If you were a DeVry student between January 1, 2008 and September 30, 2015, you don\u2019t need to do anything to apply for a refund. If you think you might be eligible, and your address has changed since you attended DeVry, you can call the FTC refund administrator at 844-578-2645 to update your address.  \n  \n",

Who would you recommend for help or advice in filling this out.  I dont have access to my email used back then so I cant pull anything up.  If anyone has any old flyers that were misleading from this time or any help at al let me know.  Thanks",

            "comment": "Hey there Kev! Just like Lavab1t, I only had what information I could find online to kind of guide me in the right direction with the application. I found the official FTC Case online and referenced the material they presented in the court documents. They had cited almost every instance of deception that they used in their advertising.\n\nI attached the FTC documents as well as my unofficial transcript to my application. It infuriates me that I graduated from this damn school as a Summa Cum Laude over three years ago and I still haven't found a job putting my education to use yet. \n\nIf anyone gets a response back about their application, please keep us updated so we know how things are looking. For all of our sakes I hope we can get some peace of mind and reprieve from this pit we were tossed in. The \"relief\" check I received in the mail doesn't even cover half of a single month payment on my student loans.",

I did it the best I could and referenced the FTC Case. I got a check from them as well so hopefully it will be obvious I went there during the timeframe they misled everyone. Did you get you transcripts and stuff from DeVry yet? They should be able to email you a PDF of your official transcripts. I think it cost a few bucks. ",

Im worried I will miss something and I guess you only get one shot at it.I email Pam Bondy our state attorney tonight to see if they can be of any help.  I was just seeing if you had any advice.",

I filled it out the best I could with all the info and documents I could find. Guess we will see. I called and they said it can take anywhere from 6 months to 2 years. I'll post back one day when I hear something. Good luck!",

There is an example or two for BDTR on Facebook groups dedicated the Corinthian colleges/other for profit schools that were fraudulent. I would caution against copying that format as it isn't tried and true and you should have some evidence unique to you. I'd join those groups to stay up to date on what's going on.",

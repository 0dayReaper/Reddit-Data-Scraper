    "postText": "Ok i am a student attending devry uni and I'm one month in, as of right now im taking core classes and I am pursuing \"information tech systems and programming\". So far my experience hasn't been all that bad. \nSo my question is, why do people talk so bad about the school ? Yes I know its a for profit and its mostly online but I mean the school can't do EVERYTHING for you. Any insight would help thanks.\n\nEdit - I have completed about 20% and i'm only in about 5,000$. I'm planning on pursuing a computer science degree as it will better my chances to learn more. Although devry is a great hands on college it is not for me. Thanks guys for whoever commented and helped :)",

Timing kept not working out or they were delaying.\n\nI was working, and I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m delivering a pizza right now can I call back or you cal me in a half hour?\u201d\n\nThe person on the phone said \u201coh your working? So you don\u2019t need placement anymore?\u201d\n\nI answered yes, but This isn\u2019t the job I was hoping to get.\n\nThe next time I got to talk to anyone they told me I\u2019d been placed and they couldn\u2019t help me.\n\nThey sent me a couple checks the last couple years.\n\nThat and only 1 out of every 5 of my professors weren\u2019t idiots.\n\nI started right after that other guy was saying around 2009. Really messed my life up. Lot of money and time for a degree people basically laugh at.\n\nThey also kept promising to pay for our CCNA carts, and didn\u2019t. It was delay delay delay about that.\n\nI picked DeVry over a couple similar seeming schools because of their job placement program.",

            "comment": "I started in '08 for Networking communications management which was basically at the turn of the tide from what I saw.\n\nThey started pushing from having on premise classes to more of an online focus. we were told that they would still have both, but even the on premis classes were changed to \"hybryd\" which was half and half, with 1 day of class per week (for each course) in a compressed format. \n\nIdk how it is now, but the online discussion platform was fucking garbage. i think i only ever had 1 Professor that effectively used it. others would post s single question and expect the whole class to give a unique answer and discuss each others answers, but it was pretty BS, and hurt my grades a bit. \n\nAlso it feel like with the compressed format, it was a constant rush to cram content, and harder to actually retain knowledge. and it really seemed to drop the quality compared to how the classes were before. I think stuff like this is why people call it a diploma factory. \n\nNow im not against online to hybrid classes, but when i was reviewing collages to go to, they sent a recruiter to the Votech school i was going to for CCNA, and they told us it would be basically like our votech school, with lots of hands on labs and working with equipment. By the time i got to my higher level networking classes, there were hardly any labs on premise, they were online, and lacked so much context. The labs were a fucking joke.\n\nThe only real reason i came out the other side prepared for my current career is because I went in with my CCNA, worked at the Student helpdesk, and got in good with my professors. But i saw so many people come to that school and struggle with the hybrid/compressed classes and not make it. \n\nProgramming is probably a good Major for the format. Just do your work, and put in the effort, and you'll make it. Just when you go to get your job, just stress your actual skills and languages you are proficient with, rather than your degree.",

            "comment": "My impression is that it goes back to when DeVry was a technical school.  They used to offer electronics certifications back in the 80's and 90's.  Personally, I think you can have a very good career and support a family off a technical skill, but let's face it: peers tend to look down on technical school graduates as if they couldn't make it at a 'real school.'\n\nAt some point, DeVry qualified to be a college.  I think this is when they started offering an Associates Degree in computer information services and another degree program.  This is when I started attending, in 2003.  Before my 2-year courses ended, they had become a University, and were offering 4-year Bachelors degrees.  To qualify as a University, I believe all professors had to have a Masters Degree.  There was a transition period where many of my former professors had to be let go, and some Vice Principals, who had Masters Degrees, were teaching classes.\n\nStill, I think the stereotype of DeVry is that folks still see it as a technical school, which it's not, and they still look down on technical certifications, which is unfair.\n\nEnjoy your classes!",

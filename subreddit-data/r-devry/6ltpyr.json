            "comment": "I see this sub is all-but dead, so I'll just give my input even though it's not what you were looking for. I'm very happy with my CIS degree (from 2002). I've worked through webdev positions to software engineering roles, and now I'm holding an architect role with senior engineer status.\n\nI believe that my CIS degree with equal focus on business and programming, has allowed me to surpass my peers. I often bring more practical solutions to the table. I'm sure it's mostly just how I think in general, but not putting full focus on the technical side as I was learning has had to have helped.\n\nI have a close friend that went through their EE program, and he's doing very well, working for an energy company. No complaints from his end either.\n\nHonestly, the only people I've heard complain are people that haven't gone there, and don't know anything about it other than it being a for-profit school, which seems to lump it in with ITT Tech and University of Phoenix, to most people.",

I stay up to date just in case I need to withdrawal due to legal issues / scamming. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for 1 1/2 more years.",

Since you\u2019ve been turned over to collections, you may want to reach out to the CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU to see if you are protected under the fair debt collection practice act. www.consumerfinance.gov \nBest of luck. Be persistent. Their deceptive practices are impacting your life. I know the debt from this school is affecting my health and credit. Sucks",

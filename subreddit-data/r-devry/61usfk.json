Washington Street Indianapolis, IN 46204 \nRe: \t Mr. Jeffrey Welter File # 17-CP-51506 \nDear Mr. Herrera, \nThis is DeVry Education Group\u2019s (\u201cDVG\u201d) response to your letter dated February 17, 2017, regarding DeVry University (\u201cDeVry\u201d) student, Mr. Jeffrey Welter. DVG takes student concerns very seriously.  The Office of Ombudsman is the highest level of \nescalation in the DVG organization, and thus, was engaged to investigate Mr. Welter\u2019s \nconcerns. \nDeVry understands Mr. Welter\u2019s complaint to be: \n. \tHe met DeVry\u2019s graduate attendance policy to remain enrolled but was \nwithdrawn from a class without his knowledge by DeVry. \n\n. \tDeVry reported the withdrawal to the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d), \nwhich created debt against him. \nDeVry understands Mr. Welter\u2019s requested resolution to be: \n. \tReimbursement of $3,500 or proper certifications of his grades to the VA. \nBelow are our findings based on our understanding of his concerns. \nI. \tAttendance Policy \nMr. Welter enrolled in the Master of Accounting and Financial Management program with DeVry\u2019s Keller Graduate School of Management. He was enrolled in FIN560 during the September 2016 session that began on August 29, 2016 and ended October 23, 2016. \nDeVry publishes information regarding graduate attendance in its academic catalog. Included for your reference are pages 145-147 of the 2016-2017 Keller Graduate School of Management academic catalog (Exhibit A). Page 146 states: \nThough attendance is not tracked after the first two weeks of the session, professors may choose to incorporate a participation element when calculating student grades. \nIn addition to the academic catalog, the attendance policy is available to students in each course.  Included for your reference is the course syllabus for Mr. Welter\u2019s FIN560 course (Exhibit B). Page 8 of the syllabus provides links to academic policies and resources. Also included for your reference is the information that is provided in each link (Exhibit C). Pages 2 and 3 contain information on the attendance policy. \nMr. Welter quoted page 146 of the academic catalog in his complaint as the basis for why he should not have been withdrawn from the class.  He also stated that he participated well beyond the first two weeks. Included for your reference is Mr. Welter\u2019s grade book for FIN560 (Exhibit D). According to the grade book, Mr. Welter did not submit assignments or post to the discussion threads after week 3. Additionally, he did not take his midterm exam, final exam or complete his course project. \nDeVry reviewed Mr. Welter\u2019s course logins and his last login to the course occurred on October 4, 2016, week six of the session.  Page 146 of the catalog also states (Exhibit A): \nStudents who do not formally withdraw from class and subsequently receive a grade of F or a designator of U due to lack of participation may be administratively withdrawn, resulting in a W for each affected course. \nAnd \nStudents not receiving veterans education benefits who receive F grades or U designators because of lack of participation are administratively withdrawn from the course, and the midpoint of the session is assigned as the withdrawal date. Students receiving veterans education benefits should see Additional Attendance Information for Students Receiving Veterans Education Benefits. \nPage 146-147 of the 2016-17 academic catalog explains additional attendance information for students utilizing veterans\u2019 educational benefits which states (Exhibit A): \nStudents who do not formally withdraw from class and subsequently receive a grade of F or a designator of U due to lack of participation are administratively \nwithdrawn, resulting in a W for each affected course. A student\u2019s last login date \nfor the course is considered the effective withdrawal date recorded in VA-ONCE. \nMr. Welter was utilizing the Post 9/11 BI Gill\u00ae1 Benefit (\u201cChapter 33\u201d) and he was subject to the provisions set forth above, thereby necessitating DeVry\u2019s review of the F grade that he received in FIN560.  As stated previously, Mr. Welter\u2019s last login date for in FIN560 was October 4, 2016, week six of the session.  Because Mr. Welter did not login during week seven and eight, his F grade was converted to a W due to a lack of participation. \n1 GI Bill is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at www.benefits.va.gov/gibill. \nThe VA provides guidance to schools on the processing of veterans\u2019 educational benefits via the School Certifying Official (\u201cSCO\u201d) handbook.  Page 79 of the SCO Handbook \nstates (Exhibit E): \nThe law requires that educational assistance benefits to Veterans and other eligible persons be discontinued when the student ceases to make satisfactory progress toward completion of his or her training objective. \nIn Mr. Welter\u2019s case, he ceased progress in FIN560 when he did not participate in week 7 and week 8.  VA-Once is the VA\u2019s online system that schools use to report enrollment and enrollment changes to the VA.  Page 73 of the VA\u2019s SCO handbook states, in part (Exhibit F): \nVA-ONCE asks for the \u201cLDA/EFF Date\u201d (Last Date of Attendance/Effective Date). \n*** \n\u2022 If a student is administratively withdrawn or stops attending without officially \nwithdrawing, the actual last date of attendance must be determined and reported. \nThe above point provides justification for DeVry\u2019s action in reporting a student\u2019s last date of attendance if an administrative withdrawal occurs.  In Mr. Welter\u2019s case, DeVry \nreported October 4, 2016 as his last date of attendance/effective date to the VA. \nAs the VA requires schools to track and monitor a student\u2019s academic progress, DeVry has a policy in place for graduate students to ensure this requirement is met. DeVry followed its policy and the VA\u2019s required reporting when Mr. Welter\u2019s last login date was reported to the VA. \nII. Certification to the VA \nOn November 16, 2016, DeVry terminated Mr. Welter\u2019s September 2016 session certification to the VA because he was administratively withdrawn. When a student does not complete a session, the VA may create debt against the student. Page 94 of the SCO Handbook (Exhibit G) provides scenarios in which debt is assigned to the student. One of the scenarios is: \nThe student withdraws after the first day of the term. \nAlthough Mr. Welter did not withdraw himself from FIN560, DeVry administratively withdrew him upon review of his F grade. DeVry contacted the VA and confirmed that a debt of $2,938.26 was assigned to Mr. Welter when his September 2016 session certification was terminated.  DeVry accurately reported his last date of attendance/effective date to the VA, as the VA requires. \nDeVry is offering to cover the cost associated with Mr. Welter\u2019s second attempt at FIN560. This will allow Mr. Welter to attempt the course again without utilizing any of his remaining months of entitlement of his veterans\u2019 benefits. He can contact me at my email address below if he wishes to accept the offer. \nSincerely, \n\nPaul Herbst Senior Associate, Office of Ombudsman \nP: 630-960-8019 pherbst@devrygroup.com \nExhibit\u00a0\n\nA\u00a0\n\nEnrollment Status \nEnrollment status is determined separately for each semester and is based on all courses in which the student was enrolled during the two sessions comprising the student\u2019s semester/student\u00adcentric period. Enrollment status is determined as of the first scheduled class in the student\u2019s earliest session (first day of the earliest session for online students). Enrollment status is not affected by the date of application or interview. Students taking six or more credit hours in a semester are full-time students. Those taking four to five credit hours in a semester are three\u00adquarter-time students. Those taking three credit hours in a semester are half-time students. Those taking three credit hours in a semester are half-time students. Those taking fewer than three credit hours in a semester are considered enrolled less than half time. Students enrolled in courses that do not carry credit hours are also considered enrolled less than half time. \nNote: F-1 students are required by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to maintain a full course of study in their program. Any exception to this requirement must be approved and updated in the student\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record prior to a change in enrollment (see the Student Handbook for more information). Graduate F-1 students must maintain at least six credit hours per semester and must enroll in at least one onsite course each eight-week session to maintain a full course of study. \n\nGoverning Rules \nStudents are generally governed by graduation requirements in effect at the time of initial enrollment, provided their enrollment has been continuous. Students who change programs are governed by graduation requirements of the new program in effect at the time of the program change. Curriculum changes may occur, as DeVry reserves the right to change graduation requirements and to revise, add or delete courses. Consequently, curriculum changes may affect current and returning students. Program or policy changes that affect students who are already enrolled are announced at least 90 days prior to the effective date of the change. \nContinuous enrollment requires no instance of more than six consecutive sessions out of school. For each interruption of continuous enrollment, students must apply for readmission and are governed by graduation requirements and academic rules and policies in effect at the time of readmission. \nThe University reserves the right to cancel a section of a course if enrollment is insufficient. \nStudents may transfer to another Keller location and retain credit for all coursework completed; however, program availability varies by location.  \n\nAttendance \nNote: The State of Nevada requires attendance to be taken for all students enrolled at a Nevada location. \nClass interaction is an integral part of graduate-level practitioner-based programs. DeVry \nUniversity\u2019s graduate student attendance policy is operational in nature and consists of tracking \nattendance during the first two weeks of the session only, for the purpose of identifying an official enrollment count.  \nStudents who never participate during the first two weeks of a course are dropped from that course for non-participation. Students dropped from all courses because of non-participation should note that they are also dropped from courses in which they are enrolled for future sessions. \nThough attendance is not tracked after the first two weeks of the session, professors may choose \nto incorporate a participation element when calculating student grades. Grading criteria include requirements for class participation in academic events and the extent to which work missed due to non-participation can be made up. \nSite-based classes require both classroom and online participation. Students who anticipate missing one or more onsite class meetings should contact their professor as soon as possible and should seek academic advising. \nStudents in an online course who anticipate missing more than a seven-consecutive-calendar-day period of class participation should contact the professor as soon as possible and should seek academic advising. Online class participation includes submitting class assignments, participating in threaded discussions, completing quizzes and exams, completing tutorials and participating in computer-assisted instruction. \nDuring the session, students may withdraw from a course, or from all courses, by requesting a course withdrawal from their student support advisor or academic advisor, or from an appropriate academic administrator verbally, by email or by submitting a request through the interactive student communication system. Students who inquire about a withdrawal are contacted to confirm their intention to withdraw. Students are withdrawn from their course(s) if they cannot be reached or do not respond regarding their inquiry. \nStudents who do not formally withdraw from class and subsequently receive a grade of F or a \ndesignator of U due to lack of participation may be administratively withdrawn, resulting in a W for each affected course. \nFinal grades of F and designators of U are evaluated at the end of the session for students who receive one of the following: \nx All grades of F x All designators of U x All grades of F and designators of W x All designators of U and designators of W x All grades of F and designators of U x All grades of F, designators of U and designators of W \nDeVry presumes students who receive a passing grade, or who earned a grade of F or a designator of U, in one or more courses taken during the session completed the course(s) and thus earned the grade(s)/designator(s).  \nStudents not receiving veterans education benefits who receive F grades or U designators \nbecause of lack of participation are administratively withdrawn from the course, and the midpoint of the session is assigned as the withdrawal date. Students receiving veterans education benefits should see Additional Attendance Information for Students Receiving Veterans Education Benefits. \n\nAdditional Attendance Information for Students Receiving Veterans Education Benefits \nStudents who do not formally withdraw from class and subsequently receive a grade of F or a \ndesignator of U due to lack of participation are administratively withdrawn, resulting in a W for each affected course. A student\u2019s last login date for the course is considered the effective withdrawal \ndate recorded in VA-ONCE. \n\nClassroom Visitors \nStudents are encouraged to bring prospective students to onsite classes as guests; however, they must first receive approval to do so from the chief location administrator. \nStudents may not bring minors to class, nor may minors be left unattended on University premises. DeVry University is not liable for the safety of children left unattended while on University premises. \n\nMissed Exams \nStudents are expected to take quizzes and exams at regularly scheduled times. When this is not possible because of circumstances beyond their control, such as documented illness or work-related travel, students may arrange to take a make-up quiz or exam by contacting their professor. \nFinal exams must be taken during week eight of the session. For all other types of exams and quizzes, the professor and student agree upon an appropriate day and time to make-up the missed exam or quiz. \n\nRetention and Review of Final Exams \nFinal exams are not returned to students; however, they are retained one session for student review. Onsite students who wish to review their final exams should contact their chief location administrator. Online students may contact their academic advisor to make arrangements to view their final exams at a local DeVry University location. Students unable to visit in person should contact their academic advisor to make alternate arrangements. \nCredit for Previous College Coursework, Transfers to Other Institutions and CourseSubstitutions \nDegree requirements may be satisfied by up to six courses (18 semester-credit hours) of transfer credit) in a particular degree program. Students seeking multiple degrees must satisfy the semester-credit-hour residency requirements outlined in Multiple Degree Programs. \nRequirements for earning a concentration (except requirements for a general studies concentration) or graduate certificate may be satisfied through a maximum of three semester-credit hours of transfer credit. \nAll 600-level courses, including capstone courses, must be taken through DeVry University. \nStudents enrolled in the MSAC program are subject to a 24-semester-credit-hour residency requirement that includes a maximum of six semester-credit hours that may be transferred. Transfer credit cannot be applied to ACCT525. \n\n\nExhibit\u00a0\n\nB\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit\u00a0\n\nC\u00a0\n\nAttendance Policy \n\nNote: The state of Nevada requires attendance to be taken for all students enrolled at a Nevada location. \nClass interaction is an integral part of graduate-level practitioner-based programs. \nDeVry University\u2019s graduate student attendance policy is operational in nature and \nconsists of tracking attendance during the first two weeks of the session only, for the purpose of identifying an official enrollment count. \nStudents who never participate during the first two weeks of a course are dropped from that course for non-participation. Students dropped from all courses because of non-participation should note that they are also dropped from courses in which they are enrolled for future sessions. \nThough attendance is not tracked after the first two weeks of the session, professors may choose to incorporate a participation element when calculating student grades. Grading criteria include requirements for class participation in academic events and the extent to which work missed due to non-participation can be made up. \nStudents in an online course who anticipate missing more than a seven-consecutive\u00adcalendar-day period of class participation should contact the professor as soon as possible and should seek academic advising. Online class participation includes submitting class assignments, participating in threaded discussions, completing quizzes and exams, completing tutorials and participating in computer-assisted instruction. \nStudents in a blended or onsite course who anticipate not being able to attend onsite class meetings or participate in online activities for more than a seven-consecutive\u00adcalendar-day period should contact their professor as soon as possible and should seek academic advising. \nFinal grades of F and designators of U are evaluated at the end of the session for students who receive one of the following: \n. All grades of F \n. All designators of U \n. All grades of F and designators of W \n. All designators of U and designators of W \n. All grades of F and designators of U \n. All grades of F, designators of U and designators of W DeVry presumes students who receive a passing grade, or who earned a grade of F or a designator of U, in one or more courses taken during the session completed the course(s) and thus earned the grade(s)/designator(s). \nStudents who receive F grades or U designators in all of their courses because of lack of participation are administratively withdrawn from the course, and the midpoint of the session is assigned as the withdrawal date. Additionally, students receiving Veterans Education Benefits who do not formally withdraw from class and subsequently receive a grade of F or a designator of U due to lack of participation are administratively \nwithdrawn, resulting in a W for each affected course. A student\u2019s last login date for the \ncourse is considered the effective withdrawal date recorded in VA-ONCE. \nWithdrawals \nDuring the session, students may withdraw from a course, or from all courses, by requesting a course withdrawal from their student support advisor or academic advisor, or from an appropriate academic administrator verbally, by email or by submitting a request through the interactive student communication system. Students who inquire about a withdrawal are contacted to confirm their intention to withdraw. Students are withdrawn from their course(s) if they cannot be reached or do not respond regarding their inquiry. \nStudents who do not formally withdraw from class and subsequently receive a grade of F or a designator of U due to lack of participation will be administratively withdrawn, resulting in a W on the transcript for each affected course. Additionally, the designator of W appears on the transcript of students who formally withdraw from an individual course or from all courses. \nThe withdrawal deadline is Friday of week seven at 11:59 pm MT. Withdrawal is not allowed after this time. \nDisability Accommodations in Academic Programs \nDeVry is committed to maintaining an academic environment free of discrimination and complies with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. DeVry will make reasonable accommodations to afford students \nwith disabilities full and equal enjoyment of DeVry\u2019s programs and services. DeVry makes no assumptions concerning any individual\u2019s abilities or disabilities and makes an individual assessment to determine whether each student\u2019s needs can be met at DeVry. \nAny student or applicant with a disability who requests academic adjustments, auxiliary aids or accommodations under Section 504 should contact the Office of Student Disability Services to begin the accommodation request process. The Office of Student Disability Services can be reached by email at adaofficer@devry.edu or adaofficer@keller.edu, or by phone at ( 877 ) 496-9050, option 3. The applicant/student \n\n\n\nExhibit\u00a0\n\nD\u00a0\n\n\n\nExhibit\u00a0\n\nE\u00a0\n\nServices include: \n\u2022 \t\nCounseling to facilitate career decision making for civilian or military occupations. \n\n\u2022 \t\nEducational and vocational counseling to choose an appropriate civilian \noccupation and develop a training program. \n\n\n\u2022 \t\nAcademic and adjustment counseling to resolve barriers that impede success in training or employment. \n\n\nDetailed information regarding counseling and the entire program can be found on the Vocational Rehabilitation &amp; Employment (VR&amp;E) Service website. \n\nUNSATISFACTORY PROGRESS, CONDUCT AND ATTENDANCE \n(38 CFR 21.4203(d), 38 CFR 21.4277, 38 CFR 21.7154, 38 CFR \n21.7653(c), 38 CFR 21.7654, and 38 CFR 21.9725) \n\nThe law requires that educational assistance benefits to Veterans and other eligible \npersons be discontinued when the student ceases to make satisfactory progress toward completion of his or her training objective. Benefits can be resumed if the student reenrolls in the same educational institution and in the same program. In other cases, benefits cannot be resumed unless VA finds that the cause of the unsatisfactory attendance, conduct or progress has been removed and the program of education or training to be pursued by the student is suitable to his or her aptitudes, interests, and abilities. \nBoth accredited and non-accredited schools are required by law to have and to enforce standards of progress and conduct in order for their programs to be approved for VA benefits. Only non-accredited schools are required by federal law to have attendance standards. These standards should be stated plainly in the school's catalog or bulletin. A school's policy and regulations for standards of progress, conduct and attendance must define: \n\u2022 \t\nThe school's grading system \n\n\u2022 \t\nThe minimum satisfactory grade level \n\n\u2022 \t\nConditions for interruption of training due to unsatisfactory grades or progress \n\n\u2022 \t\nA description of any probationary period \n\n\u2022 \t\nConditions for a student's reentrance or readmission following dismissal or suspension for unsatisfactory progress \n\n\u2022 \t\nConditions for dismissal due to unsatisfactory conduct \n\n\u2022 \t\nThe school's attendance policy \n\n\nAll schools are required to maintain an academic record for each student which includes, for a Veteran or eligible person, the credit allowed toward the student's current program due to previous training and experience. The record must also show the results of each enrollment period, to include the unit courses or subjects undertaken and the final result (e.g., grade, passed, failed, withdrawn, test results). The record must be cumulative and document the progress being made toward completion of the program. For those institutions that use a narrative grading system and/or unspecified academic terms, as opposed to the traditional grading system and specified terms, the academic record must contain sufficient information to permit the recipient of a transcript to make an informed evaluation of the student's \n79 \n\n\n\nExhibit\u00a0\n\nF\u00a0\n\nAMEND, ADJUST, AND TERMINATE (38 CFR 21.4203) \n\nA copy of the Notice of Change in Student Status should be printed and put in the student's school file. \nA Notice of Change in Student Status reports one of three distinct actions. \n\u2022 \t\nAmend is used to change begin date, end date, Tuition and Fees, Yellow Ribbon, add a remark, and advance pay and accelerated pay requests on a certification already submitted. \n\n\u2022 \t\nAdjust is used to report an increase or decrease in credit hours. If tuition, fees, or Yellow Ribbon were reported, they must also be changed to correspond to the adjusted number of credit hours. \n\n\u2022 \t\nTerminate is used to report a complete withdrawal from an enrollment period, or to report graduation or program completion. If a student certified for multiple enrollment periods completely withdraws from one enrollment period, then terminate the enrollment period from which he withdrew. VA\u00adONCE will give you the option to terminate any subsequent enrollment periods or to leave those periods as certified. \n\n\nLast Date of Attendance/Effective Date \nVA-ONCE asks for the \u201cLDA/EFF Date\u201d (Last Date of Attendance/Effective Date). \n\n\u2022 \t\nIf a student officially withdraws, the date the student withdrew is the effective date. \n\n\u2022 \tIf a student is administratively withdrawn or stops attending without officially \nwithdrawing, the actual last date of attendance must be determined and reported. \n\u2022 \t\nIf a student completes the term with all \u201cF\u201d and/or non-punitive grades, then determine and report the actual last date of attendance for each course and, if required, terminate the student for unsatisfactory progress. \n\n\nUse one of the following methods to determine the last actual date of attendance: (1) attendance records, (2) grading reports, (3) last date on which examination or other papers filed, or (4) last day of activity in the instructor's records. \nNote: A signed statement from the student as to the last day of his or her attendance may not be used as the sole means of verifying attendance. \n\n\nREDUCTIONS AND WITHDRAWALS (38 CFR 21.4203) \n\nReduction and Withdrawals (Chapter 33) \nAll changes in credit must be reported, generally within 30 days of the change in enrollment [38 CFR 21.4203]. Keep in mind that credit may be divided between resident credit (Res) and distance learning credit (Dist) for Chapter 33. Adjust resident credit and distance hours separately based on how the adjustment affects one, the other, or both. \n73 \n\n\n\n\nExhibit\u00a0\n\nG\u00a0\n\nCHAPTER 33 FISCAL ISSUES \n\nGenerally overpayments of VA benefits are the responsibility of the student. However, there are instances under the Post-9/11 GI BILL (Chapter 33) when an overpayment is created on a school and funds need to be refunded to VA. \nDebts and Overpayments \nA debt is established on a school when: \n\u2022 \t\nThe student never attended any classes for which he or she was certified regardless of the reason for non-attendance \n\n\u2022 \t\nThe student completely withdraws on or before the first day of the term (FDOT) \n\n\u2022 \t\nThe school received payment for the wrong student \n\n\u2022 \t\nThe school received a duplicate payment \n\n\u2022 \t\nThe school submitted an amended enrollment certification, or an Amendment in VA\u00adONCE, and reported reduced tuition and fee charges, reduced Yellow Ribbon amount, or reduced both. \n\n\u2022 \t\nThe student died during the term, or before start of the term \n\n\u2022 \t\nVA issued payment above the amount certified on the enrollment certification that was used to process the payment (VA data entry error) \n\n\n\nA debt is established on the student for Tuition/Fees/Yellow Ribbon when: \n\n\u2022 \tThe student withdraws after the first day of the term \n\n\u2022 \t\nThe student reduces hours whether the reduction occurred before or during the term \n\n\u2022 \t\nThe school submitted a change in enrollment (on VA Form 22-1999b, or an Adjustment through VA-ONCE) and reported a reduction in tuition, fees, and/or Yellow Ribbon due to student action reducing or terminating training. \n\n\u2022 \t\nIf a student drops a course and adds a course so that there is no net change in training time, any change to tuition, fees, and/or Yellow Ribbon is a student debt \n\n\nSchools must refund tuition and fee payments to students in accordance with their established refund policies so that the students can resolve any overpayments. \nIf a school debt has been established and your school believes that it is not appropriate, please notify VA through the Internet Inquiry System or by letter to the RPO (not the Agent Cashier). \n94 \n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "If you stop participating in a course, the school has the right to withdraw you (academic withdraw) per their written policy. If you are withdrawn, the school is required by federal law to report the last date of attendance to VA for student's using VA education benefits. Because this is a non-punitive grade, you need to submit mitigating circumstances to VA to explain why you stop participating in this class and to request you not be charged a debt. This is a very routine action. \n\nWhen you sign up for a class, you need to participate in the required discussions, and if you formally withdraw during the school's full refund policy, you would have received a refund of your tuition but if not you have to pay the VA back as they paid the school apparently.  Posting the above doesn't explain anything other that you didn't do what you were supposed to do for the class. Posting the attendance policy and pages out of the SCO handbook doesn't support your case/situation as 99% of those who read this won't know what that means.\n\nhttps://gibill.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1564/kw/Mitigating",

The FTC will eventually shut them down for good. \n\nFurthermore - clearly this all makes my blood boil - while explaining my situation my alleviate my indebtedness with the VA, Devry still makes out like the bandits they are.  \n\nSo why is it they changed my grade? So they could slither out of their whole, collect the money from the VA, and leave me to deal with the VA - explaining my case and having the debt removed.  Does this seem right?  ",

Part of being paid by VA is the student's obligation to attend the classes and complete the course. \n\nNot sure what you think the FTC will do. As long as they have a valid academic accreditation, the VA and Department of Education are going to continue to allow students to attend this school.",

Why would any reputable University report a W when they can simply report an F?  With a W the University gets paid while the Veteran is left with a $3k VA bill.  An F, the University gets paid and the Veteran has a bruised ego but walks away relatively unscathed. \n\nMore guessing, the W route saves the Veterans educational benefits and allows the school that much more booty at the end of the day. \n\nSounds like unscrupulous business practices to me.  \n\n\n\n",

So it's better for you and not the school to give you the W instead of an F - Also F grades must (by federal law) be reported to VA with the Last Date of Attendance so you would have the same Debt to VA whether this was reported as a W or F grade but now you GPA isn't as low because they gave the  W instead of the F. So nothing predatory going on with your situation. \n\nSo send in the mitigating circumstances to VA to try to get the debt waived if you can.",

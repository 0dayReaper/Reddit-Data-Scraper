    "postText": "Hello Dean Jeunet Davenport, Thank you for your congratulations on graduation in advance, however I chosen to take control of my education and have taken my student debit to a place more suitable for learning and personal growth. I have transferred from devry ft Washington to Pen College of Technology in Williamsport, PA. (I will be selling my house to relocate just for this school)  As a graduate of devry (ECT Program 2009) I found my own employment long after graduation and the wild goose chase \"Career services\" sent me on. I found it a struggle to compete in the labor force and that I lacked a fair amount of skills, which set me up to be layed-off, as I was not at a level to be competent in an electronics career. To help obtain these skills I re-enrolled back in to devry for the EET program at Ft Washington only to find the state and condition of devry to be \"Poor\" at best, as there are no full time professors (The school appears to be running on Tutors, adjunct faculty and there are little to no on-site Classes offered), no real resources (Working Electronics Lab, Bookstore, Library), no student comforts (Lounge, cafe, etc), the students are unprepared and the instructors cave to omit requirements due to this lack of structure. (i.e. electronics labs - 1 of 4 students bought the \"tools and electronic supplies\" so the teacher omitted the soldering lab, even those 3 of the 4 students couldn't solder.) I really thought that devry had there act together and that it was a good thing, now i have come to find out that devry is a lot less than good, its border line a SCAM, as devry just takes Pearson online courses polishes it with a devry logo then finds hack a of an instructor to oversee a web blog of copied and pasted comments and the use of template instructor responses (a lot of the interaction from the professor was signed \"Instructors name here\", all while burdening these young students with Financial debt to take classes disguised as critical thinking classes (Coll 148) to cover devry's responsibility to explain to students that the money they borrow has to be paid back. Coll 148 was straight up highway robbery as it is a required course, I am very sick and disgusted with the way devry has treated me, cheated me, insulted my intelligence, and at this point I'm embarrassed to put devry on my resume. \n\n[](http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/15/pf/college/devry-settlement/index.html)",

Well I did for the past 12 years.\n\nThere isn't anything special about the Mesa Campus versus the Phoenix or Glendale campus except that team there is very good.\n\nThe staff are fantastic. The teachers are as well, but they all travel from each campus. The staff (non-teacher) all work local.\n\nIs it a waste of money is something I am not allowed to respond to. \n\nSpecifically you get out of your education what you put into it. It takes a lot of work. \n\nWhich program are you working on?\n\n(I was a former Chair of the evening programs for the metro I know each well OR can get more information for you).",

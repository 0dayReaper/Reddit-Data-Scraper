It was expensive, the instructors didn't seem to care about the work or the students, and half of them didn't respond to questions/concerns, to the point where I was calling Student Services on a bi-weekly basis to get them to nudge my instructors to answer emails.  I would definitely take a closer look at your other options before signing with DeVry.",

My own student success coach called the Dean in order to help me avoid having to take an online class last session because even she knew I wouldn't learn nearly half of what I would in the actual class room setting.

I've gotten to know everyone very well and they are always pushing each other out of the way to help. I've never had one class on campus I wasn't happy with. If anything try to take as many campuses courses as possible. So far all the online classes I've taken at DeVry are a complete joke and waste of money. ",

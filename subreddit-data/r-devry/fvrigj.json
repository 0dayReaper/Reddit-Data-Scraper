    "postText": "I'm researching DeVry's Electronics Engineering Technology program, and I keep seeing mixed reviews on various sites about the quality of DeVry's courses and professors. So I am curious to see what current students and graduates from here think about the university. Do you think it was worth the cost? Did you like your program/the professors? What about anyone that's doing or has done this EET program?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank's for your insight.",

            "comment": "So I went through the network security track and it did a fairly good job for preparation. The biggest thing is you have to do tour own work on the side, which the same for any other program anywhere else. For me, I need certifications. For engineering, I\u2019m not sure. Possibly a state accredation for engineering (like a license?). The point being, a job will likely not look at where the degree is from (with the exception of OP Ivy League schools) and only care about the degree being from an accredited college. They care about if you\u2019re qualified.",

I had several instructors that were high importance individuals in their fields (a cloud security expert, several network admins with security concentrations, someone from the DoD, etc). I think that helps tremendously to not feel \u201cbuyers remorse\u201d.\n\nCoat is something you can\u2019t really attribute until you\u2019re in end game status, ie a job. If you look at it, from a full track perspective you\u2019re walking out in the end with 40k debt and a degree. Other people are doing the same but with double to triple the debt. I think it was worth it, but others may not.\n\nAs for anything to be done differently, I only wish I asked more questions. \u201cWhere can I learn more outside of class?\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s requires for this?\u201d, \u201cis there anywhere I can look for internship opportunities?\u201d And more. Keep in mind devry is more about getting you out the door into an employer and teaching you the skills to learn in your own. Sure they teach you, but not as much about the track as they do about working.\n\nHopefully this helps you feel a little more informed.",

            "comment": "I am an EET grad.  Got my Bachelor's in 2008.  The courses were different then, 15 weeks in class room more like a traditional college.   I have done well with my degree. My career has deviated from electronics quite a bit. I am a Quality Engineer for an aerospace company that makes engineered materials.  I definitely would not be where I am without the degree. \n\n It is expensive and extremely difficult once you get past associate's level courses.  If you are considering devry because the entrance bar is lower than other four year schools I would recommend other options, like starting at a community college and transferring to a four year school once you have the grades.  If you are considering it because of a scholarship opportunity it is definitely worthwhile to persue.",

I have had some courses with amazing instructors that make the coursework, no matter how mundane or exciting it may be, very enjoyable. I finish the course with a thorough understanding of what we did and am very comfortable knowing I could replicate that work today.\n\nThen there are instructors like one of the courses I am currently in who give very vague, almost nonsensical, directions. The only help they give when reaching out to them is that you have to watch the recorded lectures which are just as nonsensical as the directions. Very frustrating.",

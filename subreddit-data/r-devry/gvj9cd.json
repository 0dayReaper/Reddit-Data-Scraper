    "postText": "Hello all! I am curious on if anyone else filled a Borrower\u2019s defense claim against DeVry? Long story short I filed mine back in 2017 and have yet to receive a response. I check online a couple times a week and look up if there is any news regarding DeVry or Borrower\u2019s defense claims in general. \n\nAnd after graduating years ago I was only able to find a QA job with an insurance company in New Jersey. Not to blame 100% of my failed interviews on DeVry. But having that name on my resume isn\u2019t exactly doing me any justice. \nThanks!",

The worst part is that since DeVry is not WASC accredited, the credits don't transfer to any other schools, so if I wanted to get a bachelor's degree, it would only be from DeVry. $40k more and another useless piece of paper? No thanks. Graduating from DeVry is the dumbest thing I ever did.",

I have requested my transcripts from them so i will submit  that. Anything else you guys recommend to submit or that will help my  case to get these loans dismissed? I keep getting phone calls from an  automated system saying that my loans may qualify for a loan dismissal,  is this legit? Can anyone confirm? Thank you all! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S Do you guys still have to make payments to your loans while this is being reviewed?",

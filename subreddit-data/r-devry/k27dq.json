Users can't download their books unless logged on as local admins.  and no one bothered to tell local IT this.  Most students really hate it, but I think it is because of shitty performance in the first week, and people generally don't like change.  ",

All the pages look like they're information from some website rather than actually being a book.\n\nAs someone who has a visual learning style that helps me learn and remember based on structure and organization of pages this nearly doubles my study time.",

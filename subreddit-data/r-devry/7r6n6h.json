I\u2019m curious to know about your experience during interview process and what type of feedback you received. While I completely agree that DeVry did not prepare me for the real world, I was able to learn on the job which eventually lead to bigger and better opportunities. Hope everyone is doing well",

            "comment": "I graduated from DeVry Phoenix's CIS program in 2002. I was already working in web development as of 1999, but I thought the program did a pretty great job of preparing me for the real world and the jobs I landed after graduation. With our focus being on not only programming, but also business, I felt more confident in helping solve business problems with my own analysis and not just being a person on the implementation end. That's been crucial in realizing my career path to my current position of system architect.\n\nI know I'm not answering your question since I haven't had any problems finding work, but just figured I'd comment anyway since there's only a handful of subscribers to this sub.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the reply! I think the school gets a bad reputation because people expect to be taught everything needed to be successful once they graduate. I know a good amount of people who went to various well known universities who feel their school failed them in the same manner as DeVry and are unable to find work. What most don\u2019t realize is that college is really there to Point you in the right direction, but to be successful you have to continue learning on your own time as technology is always changing.\n\nIn regards to being defrauded, I do feel as though I was misled when it came to taking out loans. In some cases I was instructed to take out multiple loans for a single semester, which has resulted in most of my monthly payments being interest. At the time I did not know any better and unfortunately there is nothing I can do. The only thing I could do is come up with A plan to pay them off quickly. ",

I kicked payoff into high gear a few years ago with the goal of having both mine and my wife's gradschool loans completed before 2020. It's so expensive, considering I wasn't paying much attention for a decade and was paying mostly interest, and it was the same for my wife. It's going to be so nice when they are paid off because it's going to double our extra money beyond bills.\n\nI feel like I was told from the very start that my education would be a bedrock to build from, and as such, coursework used languages as a tool to learn constructs. We'll have to learn new languages outside of school, but not much within the language should be much of a surprise. You probably had COBOL/CICS/JCL classes that you would never take a job actually working with, but would you say they were pointless? I think a lot of concepts from CICS helped me to understand web programming in general.\n\nReally, I think DeVry gets a bad rep mostly because they're for-profit, and people assume that means they're a boogeyman out to take cash and dole out worthless degrees to kids that weren't accepted into \"real\" colleges.\n\nPersonally, I'm satisfied with my education. I was a 4.0 student in high-school and I was accepted to other colleges, but I chose DeVry because I wanted to get out in the work force as soon as possible, and I wanted be able to change my school schedule around a job should I get one before graduation. It played out perfectly for me.",

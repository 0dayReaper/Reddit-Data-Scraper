    "postText": "Hey everyone so I'm bit worried about my future. At the time I'm writing this I'm 77 percent done with my degree program. The reason I'm worried is because of how devry is structured being that most of the classes are only available online. With this being the case I don't really have any hands on experience. The material they do teach is outdated you could easily Google most of it and find answers. On top of that the incentives such as career services and counseling seems to have vanished. I recently saw a commercial for my computercareer and take a tour with them. I got a very good feeling with them compared with devry. The problem is with being so close to finishing with devry I stuck at crossroads of potential getting a useless degree or going some where that could give me the tools I need to succeed. So I guess what I'm asking is if there what do y'all think I should do. If there anyone who was been in a similar situation with devry I would love to hear from you thank you for your time ",

            "comment": "I think this is a pretty common situation. I had the same problems with not being able to take on-campus classes because they wouldn\u2019t have enough students to hold the class so I would either have to take a useless class that didn\u2019t count toward my major and hope that next semester they will have the class or just take it online which always sucked. The best advice I can give you is to look for internships. Once I found an internship in my field/major, that gave me way more experience then the classes did and I stopped worrying about the classes. I still finished my degree but what got me my job was the internship and the work I was doing there. Many times I considered transferring to another school but the way DeVry is setup, your credits may not transfer. So if you more thrn half complete already you are better off sticking it through. Good luck buddy! It always a shame to hear DeVry is still ripping people off like this. ",

Without that, I would recommend looking up local companies in your area and then go to their careers page. Even if they don\u2019t list a position as an intern, you could look for an entry level position and apply and mention that if they feel you are under qualified that you would be happy for the opportunity as an intern to gain experience. In many cases like mine, an internship can lead to a full time position and from there things get much easier. ",

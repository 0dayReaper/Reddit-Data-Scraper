    "postText": "I think Google Maps makes good use of user input. Obviously, the functionality of the site relies on some sort of input. It has the main search bar which allows users to search for specific addresses, OR search for something as broad as \"fast-food\".\nUsers can also click \"get directions\" and two input boxes appear, allowing them to enter their location and their destination.\nAnother great way of using input is the map itself. Users can click and drag the map to select their destination.",

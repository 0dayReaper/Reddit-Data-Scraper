You may belong to a company who has offices in different areas, but this seems...for lack of a better term lackadaisical. \n\nMaybe it's because of my military background, but there's really no direction. So it's difficult to figure out how this is supposed to work.\n\nAdditionally, its halfway through the week and only one other guy in my group has introduced themselves and we are supposed to have an idea of what we want to do by Sunday. If I'm the first to make a move on something, I get really nervous.",

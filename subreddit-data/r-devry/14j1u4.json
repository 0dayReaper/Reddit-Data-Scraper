I just replied to all student discussions last night via my iPad using chrome (which still uses the safari rendering engine).\n\nAn app would be nice so you could upload assignments, but I would probably just go with onlive or splashtop at that point since zipping and all that would have to be supported by iOS as well for many assignments.",

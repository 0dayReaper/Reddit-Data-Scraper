The common denominator for people likely to hold an anti Vax mindset is the religious and the affluent. The religious cause they dumb and have convinced themselves God wants them to remain \"pure\" and the rich because they are arrogant and don't want that peasant stuff in their rich blood. This went all the way back to the 19th century with rich folk openly saying their children's blood was better off staying pure. \n\nThey truly think they are a different breed than us peasants.",

There are unknowns, which can't be proven, but also can't be disproven. Religion requires belief. I am speaking as a chemist who focused in organic chem. When you are in the lab you don't \"believe\" that water will boil at 100 C, you know it will because it has been demonstrated. If you are working out a hypothesis you might have a hunch or believe a result will be the outcome of your experiment, for example setting a hot plate to 80 C. The water will never boil (STP), it will get hot, and eventually evaporate, but a roiling boil will not occur.",

It is becoming very public, and it is something that hasnt been that strongly denounced until recently. The fact that Kanye, Nick Cannon, and Kyrie Irving have all said this stuff means it has already been spread. It was festering for a while and these are just a few of the first signs.

Why not just create a new black character and allow him to exist in their universe. It's almost like a 'look how crazy this version is!' decision, which is actually pretty insulting.",

I am ashamed it took me this long to get into the show but every episode has me dying. Pigeon is an absolute beast, so vulgar I love it. Yung and Marquess always have great backing dialogue and Mike\u2019s cluelessness is so entertaining. The whole team works well together and I absolutely love the show. I genuinely only tune into Adult Swim now to watch which two MTM episodes are playing that night. Such a great show and I highly recommend it to anyone who\u2019s been on the fence about giving it a shot, it\u2019s absolutely worth your time and you\u2019ll be sucked into watching more.",

Venture Brothers is lightning in the bottle because a majority of the episodes are written by the same guys and they are very focused on continuity and story building. They use pop culture as part of the world instead of references for one-liners.\n\nThey respect and love the source material - they satire it instead of openly mocking it. None of their characters act like cringy meme generators. When a character says \"Hashtag X\" it is actually funny (usually cause its Doc saying it) because he does not actually know what it means. He is just quoting his sons. Hank and Dean dont break forth walls or go 'dont you hate X Y that is totally our situation because meta meta meta!'\n\nWhen Dean complains about the Adventurer life, he is not winking at the camera. He has actually life experience in this and hates it. Not the genre the show is abour \n\nThis show uses that talk to mock the generation. Its not witty but more ham fisted.",

Like look how much animation was straight up removed from HBO max, among many other shows and movies. My belief is that someone doesn\u2019t believe animation sells so they forced forced Scooby doo into things to attempt to appease to this person",

It\u2019s pretty clear then that their strategy was to just overload HBO max with content and then outclass Netflix because their catalogue of movies/shows is more well known. With the merger it\u2019s incredibly clear that they are making choices that are purely financially motivated, doing things like licensing their content to other streaming services. The thing that blows my mind is that this is really making their platform worse and I don\u2019t see how they are going to compete with Netflix/Disney+/Hulu if they\u2019re gutting their own service like that. Someone really out of touch is leading this and making choices like we\u2019re a decade in the past",

Velma isn't all JINKIES but she was still had the same type of flavor of being smart but not a bitch, like it seems the new Velma is. \n\nFred was all about his traps and super obsessed with them to the point he kinda forgets everything around him. Funny, cute and highly annoying at times. He isn't a douche frat boy like Velma makes him out to be. \n\nI don't even want to touch in how much they changed shaggy with the new dude...like...I hope to god they don't make him another stereotype instead of the fun loving dude who's a coward.",

When I saw Harrison Ford live in Kansas City when he visited for a baseball movie he was in, he was trying to give an interview and legit turned around and told the very loud fans to shut the hell up lol\n\nEdit: to be clear, I am not shitting on him - everyone cheered lol. It\u2019s just that it seems odd to think of him being so reflective",

Despite the lasting legacy of Casablanca and his large filmography, Curtiz didn't have enough hits or films in the pantheon of history to be remembered by name by casual people.",

Directors of today like Nolan, Scott, Scorsese, Tarantino, etc will definitely be remembered in decades.\n\nI think Taika's comment is a little short-sighted, even if it's somewhat humble, because audiences do pay attention.

People remember that film because it's a good story and the performance by Bogie is legendary, but CASABLANCA is at it's core just another product of the studio system of early Hollywood.\n\n\n\n\nPeople will remember Taika because he has a distinct style and personality. He doesn't like to compromise his vision and works on very unique projects. Michael Curtiz would have directed CASABLANCA 2: RICK'S BACK BABY if someone at Warner Brothers threw the script at him and said make it. Taika was forced to compromise with  Marvel over THOR 4's (I don't remember the subtitle right now because it was so bad) run time and he tanked it. You can tell he stopped giving a shit about it during the edit.\n\n\nEdit: I also want to say Curtiz, while being strictly a studio director for decades, made some incredible films within those confines. ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES, THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, CAPTAIN BLOOD, YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, and MILDRED PIERCE are all incredible films worth revisiting.",

That makes a huge difference. It also has a really good script with snappy dialogue. And the best scene involving music in a movie.\n\nIt's not just Bogart. Bogart, Rains, Greenstreet and Lorre drive this movie along together. Curtiz supposedly kept telling the actors to go faster, until Lorre pranked him by not running onto the set, but riding a bicycle.\n\nIt's a very well-made movie.

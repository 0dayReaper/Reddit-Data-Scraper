            "comment": "&gt; The boss of the US media company Paramount has said he does not want to remove historic programmes from his new subscription streaming service because they no longer meet current expectations.\n\n\n&gt; Bob Bakish, Paramount\u2019s CEO, said his company had thousands of shows in its back catalogue. **\u201cBy definition, you have some things that were made in a different time and reflect different sensibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in censoring art that was made historically, that\u2019s probably a mistake. It\u2019s all on demand \u2013 you don\u2019t have to watch anything you don\u2019t want to.**\u201d\n\n\n&gt; Streaming companies have struggled with how to adapt to modern cultural expectations when it comes to archive shows, **with BritBox and the BBC\u2019s iPlayer among those removing content that is no longer deemed appropriate for modern tastes**.",

I wanna say that this was around 2006 or so. \n\nI feel like you shouldn't censor media. It was made the way it was and to change it just because we have different or more progressive beliefs, is blasphemy. Leave films, TV shows and art in their original form and learn from them.\n\nThis kind of reminds me of when YouTube started removing historical documentaries for showing things like swastikas or having what they deemed, too violent content.",

Watching old TV shows and movies is a lesson in our history as a society, showing our gradual progression from blatant racism and misogyny to a more inclusive outlook. I don\u2019t watch reruns of The Dick Van Dyke Show and get upset by how Laura is portrayed as whiny and needy, or watch MASH and get upset that Hawkeye is a sexual predator who is constantly making sexist comments and trying to get his coworkers drunk to have sex with them. Instead I note how what were once considered \u201cnormal\u201d and unremarkable prejudices, stereotypes, and behaviors have become disgraced, note how far women and minorities have come in their representation in popular media. I don\u2019t watch these 60+ year old shows as a guide for how to live my life in 2022! \n\nThese shows accurately represented our culture at a certain period in time, and watching them should be done with that historical context in mind. Who in their right mind expects the Beaver to be be \u201cwoke\u201d?! If these shows were made today they would rightfully be condemned because their mores are no longer acceptable, but if we are to laud our progress as society then we should never forget how far we have come. These old shows remind us that significant cultural progress and change ARE possible, and also remind us how far we still have to go.",

I\u2019ve been watching a lot of movies from the 60s 70s and 80s lately and it is crazy how frequently and casually they throw around racial slurs, homophobia, and violence against woman\u2019s.  It can be hard to watch and listen to for modern ears but it\u2019s good reminder that these views were not rare or hidden beyond closed doors but were very much a part of our culture and out in the open at the time",

I feel like if a work is problematic but you don't want to ban it, the right thing to do is probably to slap a \"this is old and racist\" warning on it, **and then** either to make it available on free accounts or dump it into the public domain, so that you're not profiting off of it.",

Movies as well as books and other media are one of the most important means to take a look into the past, what people thought and how society worked back than.\n\nJust imagine what our worldview would look like if people in the 80s or 90s decided to \"clean up\" movies from the 50s to 70s, or from even earlier. We would know so much less about this era, and we would rightfully be very unhappy of the clean-ups that happened. I can't think of a case when revisionist history of any kind would be appropriate.\n\nIn rare cases of seriously questionable content (i.e. stuff on the level of \"The Birth of a Nation\"), it would still be a better option to add comments (in form of subtitles, maybe... just an idea) to scenes that need them. I think this would still upset a lot of people, but it would be a lot better than banning whole movies or editing out or \"modernizing\" some scenes.",

He was reading these around the year 1910, which is a world and a half away from even when the movie came out to begin with.\n\nBut those books are themselves a world and a half away from the times of 1910, as they take place during Reconstruction.\n\nSo ultimately you have a book about post 1860's America, published in 1881, read by a child in 1910, made into a move in 1945, then picked apart in the 2000's.\n\nShit's over 100 years old no god damn wonder it's not to our standards.",

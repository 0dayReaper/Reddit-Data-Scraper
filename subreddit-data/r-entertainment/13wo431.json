We tend to forget just how large of our population are inconsiderate and rude. Customer service is an eye opening job and one that really shows what our society is. I think it more likely that he's dealt with it all and has found a mask to shield himself from all that than him being an asshole. Although he could be. Movie Stars are people too and are subject to the same foilables as we all are. We just wont ever know. But I'd bet on the mask rather than outright jerk of a human.",

Which did you least expect to go over to the extent that it did?\n\n\n&gt; **Ford**: Of course, Star Wars. But I thought Star Wars was going to work. **I don\u2019t know much about science fiction, and I\u2019m not necessarily a huge fan \u2014 I\u2019ve got nothing against it, I just don\u2019t know it that well, and I never thought that much about it** \u2014 but I do know about fairy tales because I\u2019ve got kids, so I could smell the fairy tale thing. The callow youth, the wise old warrior, the beautiful princess. I sort of knew that I [as Han Solo] was the smartass that was necessary. It\u2019s pepper. So, I sort of identified the potential for success in it. At least it would put my children to sleep.\n\nEdit: He also appeared in 'Cowboys &amp; Aliens' &amp; 'Ender's Game'",

As such it cannot be right or wrong.\n\nThe reason people go to those films, thus creating the jobs you're so worried about, is to see those stars do their own stunts. I worked in the entertainment lighting industry for 20 years and we were always extremely grateful to them (and stunt teams) for working as hard as we did and ensuring the success of the production with their work ethic and passion for the project. That's my opinion from my perspective in the industry \ud83e\udd37",

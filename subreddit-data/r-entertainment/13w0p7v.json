Weeks later, you'll still be looking for those flashes of vivid feather from the edge of your vision. Maybe a local raptor or owl on the hunt.  The intensity of nature's beauty and brutality is real.  Or maybe she's inches from your face building a nest, but hasn't noticed you yet.  You'll be like: damn I guess I love birding now, and it will be the truth.",

We're trying to get her to see as many birds as she can before she passes. And it helps us have these awesome vacations. \n\nI, personally, have never gotten into birding, but I get it. It's like IRL Pokemon. It is fun to see the two of them argue about what kind of bird it is, and get so excited when they see a new one. In the FL keys, they saw a juvenile rare heron and a rare pigeon while on a boat trip and they were so happy. \n\nOnce Grandma is no longer able to take birding trips I don't know what we will do, but we will keep trying to get her to see birds. \n\nMy mom has seen over 700 different birds and my grandma has over 400. Mom has been overseas and grandma has not. Mom has a pin from the Audubon society that she got when she reached 700 birds but she won't wear it because she hasn't seen the bird on the pin (an albatross). She will wear the 400 pin cuz she's seen that bird, some kind of rare warbler. \n\nBut it means when we vacation, we are looking for maybe 10-20 birds they haven't seen before. We end up tucked away in some really neat spots to find these few birds.",

It does not give the man authority to accost them or even worse carry around dog treats in an attempt at vigilanty park enforcement -- threatening to lure people's dogs away, \"or else.\"\n\nConversely, If a large white man approached a small black woman walking her dog alone in a park without a leash and threatened to lure her dog away with prop treats he carries arround, I feel like this story would have a very different tone.",

After the incident when they both go their separate ways, Amy Cooper makes a second call to the cops claiming he assaulted her. That's the part that really gets her in trouble - first call you can say is emotionally charged, second comes with intent.\n\nAnd the part about the dog treats comes after asking her to leash the dog or directing her about the leashed-dogs-only rule in that area. \n\nThough tbf, the part about her being attacked or harassed in the past helps to explain how and why the situation escalates so fast.",

The sign is right there.*\n\n*\u201cHER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.*\n\n*\u201cME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.*\n\n*\u201cHER: It\u2019s too dangerous.*\n\n*\u201cME: Look, if you\u2019re going to do what you want, I\u2019m going to do what I want, but you\u2019re not going to like it.*\n\n*\u201cHER: What\u2019s that?*\n\n*\u201cME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!*\n\n*\u201cHER: He won\u2019t come to you.*\n\n*\u201cME: We\u2019ll see about that\u2026\u201d before adding,\u00a0\u201cI pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn\u2019t even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.*\n\n*\u201cHER: DON\u2019T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!*\n\n*\u201cThat\u2019s when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn..*\n\n*-then posted vid\u201d*\n\nIt's literally the best version of events that he thinks paints him in the most positive light. We don't know if what he is saying is 100% accurate, because it's a he said she said situation before the recording starts. Him admitting he said \"Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it\" is him escalating it to like 50% crazy levels. And that's his version. Change a couple words, inflection, stuff like that, it could be worse.\n\nHer freaking out, coming towards him, threatening to call the police and tell them there's an African American man threatening her is escalating it to like 90% crazy levels. Now it could have been warranted if he pulled out a weapon and started chasing her or something like that. This does not seem at all to be the case though. There does seem to be a pattern of behavior by him of being aggressive toward unleashed dog owners though.\n\nChristian Cooper was in a Zoom Community Board 7 meeting talking about issues in Central Park, and he was talking about how he was using different tactics to get people to leash their dogs while in the Ramble. He said in the Zoom meeting that it's getting super ugly between birders and dog walkers, and that he's been assaulted twice, he said that two people have put their hands on him. Now it could be true that people have assaulted him twice simply because he asked people nicely to leash their dogs. People were going crazy early in the pandemic. I think it's fairly unlikely though. If he has a pattern of doing this, acting vaguely threatening, it becomes more believable that people assaulted him for being aggressive with his \"tactics\". Doesn't mean it was ok for people to put hands on him. He doesn't really explain how he was assaulted, if he went up to the dogs and offered them treats, and people pushed him away from their dogs or something.\n\nA man named Jerome Lockett, a Black man in his 30's, claimed that he had an encounter with Christian Cooper in the park. According to Jerome, Cooper had yelled at him to leash his dog. Jerome then turned and walked away. Christian pursued him, and attempted to lure his dog away with dog treats. Jerome also claims he felt threatened by Christian, and asked him to stop. Christian didn't stop, and it led to a physical altercation. Jerome pushed Christian to the ground. Apparently Christian was holding his bike helmet in a \"threatening manner\", whatever that means. Amy Cooper claims Christian Cooper initiated by screaming at her.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm fairly confident that Christian Cooper was being somewhat more confrontational and threatening than what he originally claimed in his FB post. He was acting like an asshole, making vague threats. It still doesn't excuse Amy Cooper's behavior. I do not believe she was merely describing the ethnicity of the person for no reason when she made her threat to call the police. She claims that she would have made the same statement if it was a white man, and would have told the hypothetical white man that she is going to call the police and tell them that a white man is threatening her. I'm sorry that's bullshit.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the Gold kind stranger!",

And also you never ever offer food to someone's dog without asking. You don't know if they might have some kind of allergy, and he should have known she would interpret this as an attempt to harm her dog in some way when there was a hostile interaction going on. I honestly don't remember her smiling at all during the interaction though her behavior is odd, fear can make people act in some pretty strange ways. Her dog wasn't aggressive either.",

He didn\u2019t grab the dog, he didn\u2019t call the cops, and he didn\u2019t \u2018make\u2019 her do anything. Hell, he didn\u2019t even feed the dog the treat. \n\nIt\u2019s *totally normal and expected* for other people to either interact with (or be scared of) your dogs if you let the dog approach them. Many encourage it, and kids in particular will interact with a raging lion so long as it was fluffy. There\u2019s no laws or \u2018never evers\u2019 against it for a reason. If she previously cared about allergies or stranger danger - be it the risk to the dog or *other people at risk from the dog* - then the dog would have been leashed.\n\nDollars to doughnuts she had also never previously given a shit about people petting the dog after it run up to them or chucking it food. Hell, in a park or bushland it\u2019s almost a given that a dog *will* try to chew or eat something. If she does that all the time, she\u2019s probably lucky it never went for rat bait or treated grass. She was simply already enraged at Cooper and worked backwards to \u2018\u2019a good reason.\u2019^1\n\nAnd again - reasonable person test. Do reasonable people walk around assuming that birdwatchers are carrying around arsenic to poison dogs? Do reasonable people report \u2018vibes\u2019 to the cops as assaulting their persons? Twice. After establishing the dog was most definitively not poisoned.",

To me, everything she does in the video reads as panicky attempts to get him to back off which he doesn't do. She also stated when he initially approached her he had a very threatening, load, angry tone that startled her and she became even more concerned when his tone changed so drastically to soft and meek (when he started filming). Another dog owner said they'd felt intimidated by him before and that they'd have called the cops in that situation if they'd been a woman alone. She wasn't reporting vibes, she was reporting someone who threatened her and tried to lure her dog away. He wasn't actually dangerous but she had a clear reason to think he was.",

Which is why she told him to go away, this is when the video starts . Now , she does seem alittle off / (like 30% crazy ) . But she did act with good reason . This isn't  an instance of crazy racist Karen . It's a guy that threatened to take her dog .",

I don't think he said you start making bad movies after a certain point, just that the quality of a director's films start to diminish, and they often end their career on a low note. Tarantino just wants to end on a high note. His point was that after 10 movies, most filmmaker's work is not longer as prolific as it once was. You start running out of unique things to say.",

They remove the cliffhanger at the end of the first movie too, so the audience learns about BB when The Bride does.\n\nTarantino has been talking about releasing this for years, but he never has.",

Growing up in the 90s, the superhero genre wasn\u2019t treated seriously, but it was an amazing decade for film, especially for moderately budgeted, intelligent and impactful ones. Today, it\u2019s wonderful that superhero movies have reached such a level of quality and cultural import, but studios aren\u2019t taking the same level of risk on new ideas. The landscape is always changing and hopefully we\u2019ll arrive at one with a healthy balance of original work alongside Avengers 7.",

When a few westerns finally did get made again they were very, very different from what came before.\n\nWhile there are problematic elements to the superhero genre, there's nothing as glaring as the inherent racism or black-and-white morality of the old western formula that can be poked at like that. The super hero genre will fade eventually, but it'll be more like the decline of the modern vampire genre that was so popular around the early 2000s. It'll just get replaced by the next big thing.",

It had an excellent pedigree, being directed by the guy who did the Deer Hunter, and its utter failure scared anybody off from financing a big western for basically the entire rest of the 80s.\n\nAbout the only guys who could even get Westerns made anymore after that were absolute legends like Clint Eastwood making smaller, cheaper movies (Unforgiven) or guys who were on top of the world at the time like Kevin Costner (Dances with Wolves) and they still had to wait until the 90s before anybody would sign off.\n\nI've never seen Blazing Saddles connected to the decline before. Novel perspective, sure, but I think it had more to do with changing tastes, many classic Western stars aging out or dying, and high profile flops than a great comedy movie that just happened to be in a western setting..",

Themes are so well known that the genre itself can be mocked. Shawn of the Dead. Blazing Saddles. Deadpool. \n4. Deconstruction. Themes are subverted, re-examined, or dismantled. iZombie, no country for old men, the boys. \n\nIf the fourth phase is popular enough, it often spawns a new subgenre",

They have remarkable staying power because of the variety of settings, times, and genres they can intermix with.  Westerns had to take place in the west, between 1870 and 1920, superhero films can be any time any place.\n\nThey key to their burn out will be multiple studios pumping out decent content.  Right now Marvel sits on top of a throne of box office receipts with DC tying their damnedest to claw their way up with them.  Meanwhile Image is content with making TV shows of Robert Kirkman titles.\n\nWith Marvel firmly on top they control the spigot of content and can adjust the flow to slow burn out or overload at their will.  With James Gunn taking the (co) top seat at DC Films, Marvel may have to be reactive to another studio now which means more content, which means accelerated viewer burn out.\n\nI say all of the above as  die-hard Marvel fan and someone who is amped for James Gunn to finally make DC Films do something worth a god damn.",

Now he\u2019s sitting on the newest \u201clow art\u201d genre as if it has nothing to offer. \n\nI\u2019ll admit the marvel movies are not my favorite but there have been some really cool ideas that came out of them and a few exceptionally good movies I\u2019m excited to see future generations on film makers riff on and expand the way Tarantino used to with his childhood favorites.",

There is always a dominant genre of action movies that are churned out by studios. The only difference is one studio is beating the others at making that genre now. \n\nLike I said, I don\u2019t love the marvel movies but they aren\u2019t without merit and we\u2019ve already began to see the cool stuff that can happen when filmmakers start to expand the genre with stuff like Logan, the boys, and bright burn. I think it will be a while before we start getting great movies that truly redefine the genre but the seed is already there.",

            "comment": "***From The Telegraph's Robbie Collin in Cannes:***\n\nTwenty-seven years into his filmmaking career, Wes Anderson is having something of an unlikely social media moment. TikTok users are reenacting their daily routines with artsy insouciance to the score of The French Dispatch; AI mavens are generating Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter spoofs that ape his signature fastidious compositional style. Meanwhile, over on Instagram, \u201caccidental Wes Anderson\u201d shots (symmetry, quirk, pastel colours) have been racking up enough likes to justify a hardback compilation of the best. \n\nSo it\u2019s rather lovely \u2013 and exciting \u2013 that the Anderson film which should meet this moment is his oddest and most complex to date. For long-term fans who\u2019ve sometimes worried that the cerebral and emotional riches in Anderson\u2019s work can be overlooked it\u2019s pure catnip, but you can\u2019t help but wonder what on earth the Gen-Z whimsy-seekers will make of it. \n\n**Read Robbie's review in full:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/asteroid-city-cannes-2023-wes-anderson-review/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/asteroid-city-cannes-2023-wes-anderson-review/)",

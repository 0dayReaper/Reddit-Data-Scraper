You can\u2019t save a three dimensional artifact forever without incurring some costs,\u201d he says. \u201cPart of the ethos of everything that we\u2019re trying to do is to save this stuff and keep it from winding up in the dumpster.\u201d\n\nRead more: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/how-to-bid-on-iconic-props-from-films-like-star-wars-and-batman.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/how-to-bid-on-iconic-props-from-films-like-star-wars-and-batman.html)",

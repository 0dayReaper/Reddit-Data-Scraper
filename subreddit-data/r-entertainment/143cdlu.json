Licht looked to be trying to spin plates that were so contradictory that no amount of monitoring would make them keep working.\n\nIn one place, he wants facts not opinions crowding in.\n\nIn another, he wants to make sure to include all perspectives.\n\nThe problem here for me is he wants to attract GOP back to CNN\u2026..*and that is a lost cause currently*.  They keep thinking it\u2019s still the GOP of 40 years ago but it\u2019s been *running off the rails* since fucking Clinton\u2026hell since Reagan honestly in the fringes.\n\nConservative politics hasn\u2019t been according to the old policies for decades.  When have you heard of a solution that asks for economic reform by bettering the tax system from any GOP?  I\u2019m mean other than \u2018trickle down\u2019 which is proven to be utter bullshit?\n\nWhen has anyone with an R in their name said anything that even remotely sounds like something to help the country?  \n\nThe GOP is not only lame duck, it\u2019s now herds of them standing mute behind some very big, very stupid ducks marching them over a cliff and declaring they know best.  \n\nIt\u2019s a load of bought and paid for flunkies who would rather burn the world to cinders than say their guy is wrong and be quoted.\n\nIt\u2019s a goddamn party of spineless assholes who make up blatant lies to not have to answer for not actually doing anything.\n\nAnd CNN wants these bunch of dipshits to watch them.\n\nThe high whining sound we all hear is Edward R Murrow\u2019s corpse hitting Mach 3 spinning in his coffin.",

It was a terrible misguided approach to achieve those objectives.\n\nThere\u2019s a good 60% or more of the country that absolutely hates Trump and would rather have two normal functioning political parties again. Those people are not all MSNBC types or even Democrats.\n\nThere is most definitely a place between Fox News and MSNBC, for people who think that both of those networks can be a bit much.\n\nHowever you don\u2019t attract those viewers by dabbling into deplorable a little bit, then dabbling into far left, and going back. Literally nobody wants that. The Trump town hall was an ill-conceived disaster because literally nobody wanted to see that except for a bunch of people who hate CNN anyway.\n\nI hope somebody gets it right but whatever CNN was trying to do had no chance of succeeding.",

That's why he does rallies constantly, even outside of campaign season. When you watch the primary debates or the 2020 Presidential debates, you will see him stumble against strong criticism, especially when it's from the audience.\n\nInstead of that, CNN left an even-keeled host out to dry against a shit talking populist and a pack of hardcore MAGAs. They never would have voiced disagreement the way that a mixed crowd would, and Collins is too neutral to contest him in any context.",

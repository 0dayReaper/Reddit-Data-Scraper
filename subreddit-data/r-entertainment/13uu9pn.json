None of that made it into the official (as it were) version of the Bible, but it does seem to be in the Dead Sea Scrolls, IIRC.  Strictly speaking, he was a free-range rabbi/teacher, and traditionally rabbis *do* marry and have families.  At the very least, they were close friends and she was obviously very important to him, given that she was the first person he appeared to after the Resurrection.",

The overwhelming majority of the details of the story of Jesus are disputed, even by those scholars. \n\nBeyond that, saying \"all historians\" agree Jesus was real is factually inaccurate. So, like I literally said, do some believe he existed? Yes. But even those generally dispute the story of Jesus as it is known today.",

At least he thanked her even though he was supposed to have the power to make everyone's life better. What did Jesus actually do that was good? The Christian religion has been raping and killing people in his name since they invented him. Curious as to why Jesus didn't free those other being crucified that day. Guilty or not that was more than they deserved. A god that hung there and ignored the real suffering of others, humans not gods.To think people actually think Jesus cares about them anymore than he cared for the suffering of anyone but himself.",

Jesus, the son of god or god himself, sometimes one sometimes the other, didn\u2019t have a clue about hygiene. Funny that huh?\nBeing we are about halfway between Mothers\u2019 Day and Fathers\u2019 Day here in the US, I sure hope Scorsese includes how Jesus taught that his followers must hate their parents and siblings to follow him. \nAlso how anyone planning for the future is wrong, wonder why Jesus taught that?",

From Matthew 15:\n\n&gt;22 A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, \u201cLord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.\u201d\n\n&gt;23 Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, \u201cSend her away, for she keeps crying out after us.\u201d\n\n&gt;24 He answered, \u201cI was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\u201d\n\n&gt;25 The woman came and knelt before him. \u201cLord, help me!\u201d she said.\n\n&gt;26 He replied, \u201cIt is not right to take the children\u2019s bread and toss it to the dogs.\u201d\n\n&gt;27 \u201cYes it is, Lord,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master\u2019s table.\u201d\n\n&gt;28 Then Jesus said to her, \u201cWoman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.\u201d And her daughter was healed at that moment.\n\nI wonder if that exchange has made it into any movies about Jesus. There are some others like it.",

SPOILER &gt;! In this story, the Flash basically time travels to save his mom from being murdered. However, in doing so, he messes with the past so severely that it screws everything up. Aquaman and Wonder Woman are chaotic, Batman isn't the Batman we're used to, etc etc. The world is a mess and the only way for The Flash to fix it is to time travel again and basically let his mom die so that the world can be restored.!&lt; I may have confused some movie details (there was an animated movie) and comic details since its been a long time but that's essentially how the story works. If I'm correct, this movie takes inspiration from that story to some degree and that's how it will lead to a new DCEU.",

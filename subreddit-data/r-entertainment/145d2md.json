And while all her answers are pg, she sounds like she did not like how it all went. Especially how the director never even watched Wandavision and only got a summary of it. She always seemed to really care for Wanda and her story. And Wandavision gave her the story to really show it.",

I just know that halfway, or maybe three-quarters of the way into our writing process, I\u2019d first heard of this show they were doing and that we would have to follow it. Therefore, we had to really study what WandaVision was doing, so we could have a proper through line and character-growth dynamic.

I like the third acts of Thor 1, 3, 4, Civil War and Winter Soldier, Infinity War, GOTG1-3, Ant-Man 1 (ish - doesn\u2019t resolve the story well, but the action scenes are very creative and endearing), aaaand\u2026none of the shows I\u2019ve seen so far, those all dropped the ball, except for arguably She-Hulk, which dropped the ball on purpose and it was kinda the best episode? \n\nThey definitely have a problem with their third act, stemming from Iron Man perhaps, which definitely shined in the first two acts and kinda rode that success to a so-so third (thoigh it at least had a memorable final moment). But it\u2019s not all the films. Some genres, like fantasy and science-fantasy, benefit from a big third act confrontation, which can also represent the various character strife of the rest of the film and be satisfying to watch play out. But other genres\u2026not so much, and when the action is kind of generic and doesn\u2019t have the interesting fantasy elements to keep it fresh, it kinda just exists (Black Widow). \n\nI was hoping WandaVision was truly going to do something different for its finale, but nope, shoehorned a big bad in to fight and defeat at the last minute. I heard before reshoots it was quite different and it honestly sounded much better. Apparently Feige was making changes until the final hour.",

The Eternals, I think, is by far the worst Marvel movie. Not even close. But Chloe Zhao is an incredible filmmaker, so it just doesn't make any sense why we'd get something as sanitized, impersonal, and emotionless as Eternals from her. Contrast to GOTG3, their best showing since the end of Phase 3 AND a movie where Gunn clearly had more room to do what he wanted rather than being choked out by the mouse.",

Where they\u2019ve been marginalized for decades and had limited screen worthy content, most are more than enthused with consuming this stuff in droves.  I think the box office and myself are with them on that.  I\u2019m one of them.\n\nThe \u201cyes\u201d will have it at comedy.  The books have always struck a balance.  It\u2019s more brevity and intrigue with a dash of humor in between.  I think the consensus is pretty much the same on this take.  We\u2019re kind of sick of seeing prolonged SNL skits as movies.  It\u2019s better reserved for character pieces like Deadpool and Spider-Man where it\u2019s part of the tonal direction of the characters.",

You have to do it in a way that it doesn't unbalance  the  level of  rudness , seriousness , goofiness  each individual character has . This is a way of defining  the character and showcasing their relationship dynamic with others through comedy . This is what we had till endgame . \n\nHumor through dialouge and interaction  is much more creative and important for the overall cinemma experience than humor through dumb standalone actions ( which we have currently ) .

I\u2019m not against that type of villain in a comic book movie but to change the tone of the character so much and completely ignore Wanda\u2019s insane character growth throughout the decade of MCU stuff she\u2019s been in is disheartening. I feel like this is what happens when studios try to treat characters as their own \u201cbrand.\u201d\n\nComics are far worse at ignoring a character for their brand but, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want that to permeate in the films, too. I guess I\u2019m just used to it more in comics and it comes with the territory more. But the MCU has built up this giant narrative over the past 15ish years and these phase 5 (late phase 4? I don\u2019t remember what the phases are) films are tearing that whole narrative apart.",

Older actors who made their names and did a bunch of different projects and showed their range like Ruffalo, Rudd, or Cumberbatch I\u2019m sure have no problem coming back.

I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a dream come true at first. But then you pump them out year after year, sometimes to diminishing returns, all anyone wants to talk to you about is that no matter what else is going on in your life, and you don\u2019t even find it fulfilling work sometimes. How much can you get out of staring at a green screen and reciting some mumble jumbo that was just written for you five minutes ago because the story changed for the fifth time this week?\n\nI could kind of see her dealing with the same conflict Chris Evans seemed to have. You love the character and have a ton of fun playing in that universe but that can\u2019t be the only thing you do. Being an actor is not putting on a rubber suit every day and playing the same role for ten years. Being an actor is what\u2019s most important and sometimes that mean walking away from what\u2019s popular and safe.",

WandaVision was SO different, it\u2019s safe to say that Marvel knows how to handle Elizabeth from being bored.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe to say Marvel knows how to handle Elizabeth or her character, otherwise we\u2019d never gotten MoM, a movie that butchered Wanda\u2019s character so it can repeat the same arc we just saw only far worse and with less nuance. Even Elizabeth Olsen said she was baffled by the direction and her character being a villain, and how much of it was a repeat of WandaVision. \n\nMaybe post WandaVision you\u2019d be right, but MoM butchered the character hard to the point where half the fanbase probably doesn\u2019t even care if she returns, and it butchered all the set up and good will WandaVision garnered for being different and the work it did to make audiences care for Wanda. \n\nEven if Wanda comes back she\u2019s always going to be remembered as the nutter that murdered countless. \n\nWho gives a shit about WandaVision\u2019s exploration of grief, how it affects people and the damage it can cause, and how it treated Wanda as a tragic and nuanced character when MoM came along and reduced her to a 1-dimensional pyscho murdering people left and right because of her kids?\n\nIt\u2019s hilariously sad how much the WandaVision writers talked about wanting to avoid cliche tropes of the woman going mad only for MoM to make that Wanda\u2019s ENTIRE character. \n\nThat movie literally shat all over the themes of ideas of WandaVision and wiped its ass with them.",

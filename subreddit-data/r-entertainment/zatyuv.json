They had a few lead up episodes, one that took place during the movie the week after it's release, and then the rest of the season was basically clean up duty. \n\nI remember it legit felt like, \"Ok, sure the guys in tights do their thing, but there's a lot of stuff to clean up after they make their mess, and we're the ones who do it.\" When Coulson kills Bill Paxton is the end of the Winter Soldier story imo, not when the movie was done. Also one of my favorite MCU lines, \"HAIL HYDRA!\" \"Put your arms down Kominsky, you look like a West Texas cheerleader at a pep rally.\"\n\nThen Ike Perlmutter started, well, acting like himself, and the show had to start existing in another universe basically. But for a few shining weeks they had something truly special they could have grown from.\n\nRest of the show was great, but I'm with you. The fact Tony Stark never got to meet Coulson again is essentially a war crime.",

So often you contextualize their latest demagogue's crazy statement and you realize that it's worse. For me the biggest example was the media always showed 5-10 seconds of Donald Turnp being unhinged and weird and his supporters would be like \"oh but he's not like that all the time. That was a long rally where he was on topic the entire time\" so you line up some raw footage and... Yeah. He's on topic most of the time. It's just he's saying hateful and horrible things in a palatable way, basically. The 5-10 seconds were the TL;DR and the other 90 minutes were the in depth explanation of his horrible horrible thoughts.\n\nWith Kanye, \"I love Hitler\" is the TL;DR and \"Here's why\" is the context",

There is a separate word \"Ye\" (as in \"hear, ye\") which is pronounced \"Ye\", but it's a different word.",

The weeks leading up, he grew extremely religious, paranoid, conspiratorial, and had random aggressive outbursts. He ended up naked in the university library knocking over books.\n\nI'm no mental health expert, but when I look back on it, all of this behavior is really starting to align with what I witnessed. I think this isn't just manic depression or bipolar disorder. I think he's having a full schizophrenic breakdown and it's being aired on a global stage. If that's the case, this is really messed up, and there's no telling where this will head if it continues to worsen.\n\nNone of this is in defense of any of the content he's spewing, but if it is the case, it's a shame that a mental crisis of his will be what is broadcast as entertainment to everyone else and what becomes immortalized as his legacy.\n\nEdit: The more people share with me and the more I read into it, it may not be schizophrenia, it could just be him in an episode of psychosis from his bipolar disorder. I appreciate people trying to share more information on this topic because it's often not discussed enough until it's too late in some cases.",

I used alcohol for a long time to treat depression, and now I'm properly medicated (and sober). Actually getting treatment for mental health is such a great thing. I guess I feel frustrated when people dismissed Kanye's nazi take on bipolar because while I know bipolar can effect your perception and behaviour and even create hallucinations, it seems like it does a discredit to people  with mental illness. I don't know anyone who is bipolar who likes Hitler. I agree too about Pete Davidson, it's great he is open about his own treatment. And I think he's really funny!",

I've been in a place in my life where I've ruined friendships, been financially irresponsible, or ran the shower for three hours to hide the fact that I'm slamming my head into a bathroom wall and hitting myself in the face before, and I have many friends who have done worse, but we've all managed to never condone genocide during our mania or meltdowns.\n\nBut overall-- yeah. This is incredibly sad. Especially if he is heading into schizoeffective disorder as many speculate. At a certain point people stop seeking help, and if there's no one who can exert enough influence on him to push him into it, then... well... I guess this is what happens.\n\nSuch a talented person.

I actually smiled in disbelief. My kids were worked up tho but it\u2019s building their excitement for the next one. I think more movies should end like this. Well more good movies. Most movies shouldn\u2019t end on a hanger but there are some that would make more epic of a film and story.",

I\u2019m a little surprised that it received a PG rating, there are some pretty heavy themes and scenes that would be overwhelming for most kids up until early-mid elementary school, and even then they may not understand the concepts that the story is based upon. The animation is amazing but could also be a bit much and distressing during thrilling sequences (aka most of the movie). Just my opinion. I loved the film, but when my gf\u2019s friend said she\u2019s taking her 4 year old, just didn\u2019t seem like a good idea to me. Everyone do you, though!",

Music was so good. The plot was very emotional and heart felt. It felt genuine and i really was invested in the characters and the deep struggles and conflicts they were all going through. Im so happy the writers decided to take risks and characters have to face the consequences of their actions. Its so nice to watch a non generic super hero movie. \n\nTheres so much going on in the end. You think the movie is about to climax, but then it just gets more insane. Plus the easter egg surprises were really great. The first movie was incredible, but somehow this movie managed to exceed my hyped expectations. Probably the best spider man movie ive seen.",

Its diversity and inclusion done right.  It showed that most of the spidermen/women are brave goofballs, I loved the lines from sun-spider and the indian spider man with his bracelets represented the \"captain america\" side of spider man where they just do the right thing most of the time. This movie was amazing and well done they didnt belittle other spiderman of different groups to make one seem better or strong like the mary sue movies of recent do. Like Gwen Stacy story line was so good.  The emotion of the relationship she has with her dad and when he does what he does in the beginning you can feel the knife turn in your heart. \n\nI am a tuff critic , but this movie is what live action marvel/dc needs to learn from how to develop a diverse cast and not be cringey the way you do it.",

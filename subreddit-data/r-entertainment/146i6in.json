            "comment": "Cynthia Erivo\u00a0is opening up about her experience filming the\u00a0Wicked\u00a0film adaptation. The star who plays Elphaba in the musical took to social media to share a touching moment during the production of the film directed by Jon M. Chu.\n\n\u201cI realize I\u2019ve said very little about my experience on\u00a0Wicked and that\u2019s\u00a0mainly because I\u2019ve been keeping my head down and mining this beautifully complex being that is Elphaba, and it\u2019s really hard to put into words,\u201d Erivo wrote in an\u00a0Instagram\u00a0post.\n\nAlongside the emotional post, Erivo shared an image with her hand sporting long green nails on top of a script for\u00a0Wicked: Part Two.\n\nErivo recalled a special scene that got her emotional writing, \u201cIt is day 111 and yesterday we finished filming \u2018I\u2019m Not That Girl\u2019 when we had come to the end of that moment, my heart broke open and tears fell. (Please know this happens OFTEN).\u201d\n\nThis particular moment happens in the first act of the musical where Elphaba expressed her feelings for Fiyero, who happens to be Glinda\u2019s boyfriend.\n\nThe scene resonated with Erivo adding, \u201cI thought of us, the ones who often feel like they\u2019re on the outside. The ones who don\u2019t know that their differences, oddities, quirks are what make them beautiful and special. The ones who, for some reason, believe they can\u2019t be loved and I felt proud to sing a song that might speak to those feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am endlessly grateful to play a role that turns the notion of what beauty is on its head, I am endlessly grateful to be working with some of the most beautiful souls on the planet and I\u2019m already grieving for the day our little bubble must come to an end,\u201d she said.\n\nShe continued, \u201cI desperately hope that when you finally see this film, you\u2019ll see you, you\u2019ll see me, you\u2019ll see Jon and Ari and our hearts laid bare, you\u2019ll see pain and joy and maybe just maybe you\u2019ll see a little spark of light that says, you are who you are for a reason and you are deserving of happiness and even though sometimes it might be hard to find, it is there for the taking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope all the bumps and scrapes and scars that you\u2019ve picked up along the way, get a little healing when you finally relax in a theater with a snack a drink and hopefully, friends you bring or friends you find when you\u2019re there,\u201d she ended.\n\nAriana Grande co-stars alongside Erivo in the film set to release\u00a0Part One\u00a0on Christmas Day 2024 with the sequel scheduled to hit theaters exactly one year after that.\n\nThe film also stars Michelle Yeoh, Bowen Yang, Keala Settle, Marissa Bode, Brownwyn James, Ethan Slater and Jonathan Bailey.",

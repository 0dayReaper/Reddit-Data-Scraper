It likely exists in their catalogue from well before they bought fox. There are International, Airplane, TV Edit, etc. versions of lots of films, particularly classic films that are rated R. All studios have them.\n\nDisney+ Internationally apparently still has the unedited version, as well as other places (I heard the FX platform as well)... \n\nThis is likely a case of a poorly organized library of content, not active censorship.",

The point I am making though is these things happen and have happened for decades for various reasons, and the only reason we are seeing this now is more likely due to a lack of organization as opposed to active censoring something specific... mostly due to the fact that if Disney DID do the latter, why on earth is the unaltered version on Disney+ in the UK and Canada.\n\nI am just applying occurs razor here, the simplest explanation is most likely the right one.",

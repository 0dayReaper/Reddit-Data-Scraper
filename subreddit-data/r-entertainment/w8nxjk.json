Then, didn't they do a trial run where afterwards they gave the position to an exec on the show? So now, after all of that, they finally give the hosting spot to the guy everyone has been wanting, but he has to share the spot with someone who has no history with the show? I'm so confused, Ken seems like the perfect choice, is he just a massive douche and we dont know about it?",

The game shows content is naturally self-selecting for its audience.",

However, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the sole reason, as the initial hire was just that. There\u2019s a lot of politics in these things. As a straight white dude, I feel like we could get a lot less hate if we stopped whining about persecution all the time despite being in a world that\u2019s built for us",

That plan was scuttled after swift backlash against Richards, and the current Bialik/Jennings set-up was quickly enacted.\n\nMy guess is there's something in Bialik's original contract that makes getting rid of her more difficult or expensive, and after already having to upend their plans for Richards, they just don't want to deal with that again right now.",

If the producers were really against Jennings because of a few dumb tweets 100 years ago, they prob shouldn\u2019t have let him host the show so long.  Clearly he\u2019s who fans want and is just as capable a broadcaster as Bialik - I understand Bialik has been on TV since she was 11 and is easy to work with, it\u2019s just not happening.",

Looks like she tried desperately to backpedal as she got on Jeopardy, but it still comes off as not genuine. She claims she\u2019s not an anti-vax\u2019er while she at the same time affirms she didn\u2019t have her own children vaccinated, and that was due to an \u201cinformed decision\u201d. If your children are eligible for vaccines, and you don\u2019t vaccinate them, you\u2019re an anti-vaxxer. \n\nApparently she and her family have taken the Covid-vaccines though. So there\u2019s at least that.",

Totally not going to create a couple of future serial killers with some of the more controlling aspects of her parenting. She forbid them from playing video games, watching tv, using smartphones, and using the internet. She believes the internet has no educational value for them (she\u2019s wrong). She homeschools them, which on its own is fine, but coupled with her strict isolationist parenting is a recipe for social ineptitude. Her children don\u2019t have a bedroom and sleep in the same room as her in the same bed. The fact she has two teenage boys makes this point all the more disturbing. She doesn\u2019t let them have toys because she believes it only promotes consumerism.\n\nHere\u2019s the link to a video about it   https://youtu.be/-XJCVpDcnLg",

Yes that's correct.\" \n\nWe ALL know it was Frosty THE SNOWMAN. Why did it take so long to rule on that? Her answer was probably the full name and she didn't know if they could accept just Frosty, but damn, Ken would never do that. It really dumbs down the show when the host feels the need to explain it's \"The Snowman.\" It wastes a lot of time for needless information 98% of us know. It's like she doesn't know any of the answers and also doesn't read the clues beforehand to make sure she knows the answers.",

The way she does this \"adding on info\" thing also creates a vibe that she doesn't want anyone to feel they were totally right, or that she wants to make the impression she knows just a little more than they do. Not even right answers can go without the teeny corrections if she can possibly justify them. This combined with the kind-of-shocked way she acts when someone is right, or the incredulous \"how can you not know that\" tone when they're wrong, just makes it all seem like an ego stroke for her.\n\nShe also similarly slows down the show by adding comments about herself to everything; if the answer is a city, she'll say something like \"Where my family is from! Yes, that's correct.\" The show isn't about you, and people don't care! Keep it moving!",

The delay seems to trip up a lot of the contestants and throw a wrench in their game.\n\nAlex Trebek didn't know all of the answers, but at least he had a good flow while proctoring the game.",

Shes got a legitimate advanced science degree but was(is?) fairly anti vaxx(she claimed not to and there was evidence they tried scrubbing some of her past comments). She also said some stuff during Me Too about how she never got assaulted or harassed because she dressed modestly. She also uses her science degree to sell Alex Jones level super brain force pills that do nothing by claiming shes \u201can actual scientist\u201d\n\nShe also just isnt a great host. Admittedly she isnt terrible, but Ken is so much better its not even close",

            "comment": "Ubisoft\u2019s open-world Avatar game is almost here. At the company\u2019s Summer Game Fest preview event, we got a substantial look at the story and gameplay of\u00a0Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. James Cameron introduced the game in a prerecorded segment, teasing \u201cnew environments new flora and fauna and characters\u201d.\n\nA cinematic trailer lays out how this tale will fit in with the Avatar movies. In short, it\u2019ll cover the events of both games, with the protagonist being kidnapped during the events of the first film and schooled by the human invaders. After the events at the end of Avatar, you are cryogenically frozen\u2026 then unfrozen 15 years later in time to fight the RDA\u2019s continued invasion.\n\nThe game itself is an open-world first-person action-adventure game, where you'll be able to combine Na'vi skills and weapons with human assault weapons and a casual rocket launcher or two. (Massive, the studio behind the game, is most recently known for its work on\u00a0Tom Clancy's The Division 2.)\n\nYour Na'vi instincts will work like a scanner for detecting enemies and environment features. You'll be able to grow your character to fit your own playstyle, crafting weaponry and items from resources and upgrading your own skills as you see fit. The skill tree will include upgrades to agility and other attributes tied into your deepening understanding of your Na'vi heritage... by interacting with plants and other Na'vi.\n\nIt wouldn't be an Avatar affair without the ability to bond with sentient animals you can ride. The trailer teases the ability to ride direhorses as well as your very own ikran. You'll be able to feed and customize your partner when not flying down waterfalls. Frontiers of Pandora will include a new western expanse not seen in the movies, where you'll meet as-yet unseen Na'vi clans, including a secretive healer clan.\u00a0\n\nFrontiers of Pandora\u00a0launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, PC and, oddly, Luna. (Yes, Luna!) on December 7th 2023.",

That profligacy did not abate in the 2022 fiscal year, when the charity dropped more than $10.5 million on contractors, much of which went to companies linked to Cullors\u2019s friends and family.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cullors\u2019s brother, Paul Cullors, made out especially well. A graffiti artist with no prior experience as a bodyguard, Paul Cullors and his two companies raked in $1.6 million providing \"professional security services\" for Black Lives Matter in 2022. Paul Cullors was also one of BLM\u2019s only two paid employees during the year, collecting a $126,000 salary as \"head of security\" on top of his consulting fees.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Black Lives Matter disclosed last May it had paid Paul Cullors a comparatively meager $841,000 to [protect](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/04/black-lives-matter-6-million-dollar-house.html) the charity\u2019s swanky $6 million Los Angeles mansion in its 2021 tax year, which Patrisse Cullors used to film herself baking peach cobblers. The charity [told](https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-race-ethnicity-philanthropy-black-lives-matter-5bc4772e029da522036f8ad2a02990aa) the Associated Press it could not entrust its security to the former police officers that staff typical private protection firms.",

It was published in 2018 and does a really good job outlining the origins of the movement as well as demonstrating how the movement and the sentiments that underpin it are far more wide reaching than Cullors even if the hashing can be partially attributed to her.\n\nBLM was always a decentralized movement and M4BL is bigger than her.",

Unfortunately they have a lot of influence over people who might otherwise agree with BLM as a phrase and decentralized movement, but it taps into their fear when it\u2019s portrayed as a boogeyman which is supported by this organization and the many criticisms against it and accusations against the people involved in capitalizing on it. It legitimizes parts of the argument, makes BLM the decentralized movement and BLM the organization almost indistinguishable to most people, and it derails the important conversations surrounding BLM. BLM as a movement and as a phrase belongs to the community, and it shouldn\u2019t belong to any one individual or organization.",

MeToo's Ronan Farrow created a multimillion dollar bidding war over himself when he broke the Weinstein scandal in 2017. After a failed television show, Farrow literally proudly proclaimed he finally found his niche. And Farrow got so rich he bought a $6 million dollar town house in NYC. He made bank creating a cottage industry going after Weinstein and Woody Allen. Not saying any of these people are innocent or don't deserve a public lashing, but Ronan Farrow often misconstrued facts to further incite the MeToo movement to his own monetary benefit.\n\nSo I'd be suspect of any organization seeking donations. Even many non profit museums are really just tax shelters for rich mega corporations who don't want to pay taxes, and they cleverly get the public to pay for their administrative expenses via fundraisers, art galas, donations, etc.\n\nIt's ridiculous. Always be suspect. I argue not to donate to these organizations and just be a good person, which most people really are when they are not manipulated, poked, and prodded.\n\nJMHO",

No one's hiding it, it's just not a big deal (unless you want to use it in your continuing outrage against \"wokeism\" or whatever bullshit).  \n\nSecond, plenty of \"talent\" get signed to deals like this and also go nowhere. It's called \"development\" and plenty of projects don't see the light of day. In fact, the vast majority don't. Media companies have a significant amount of projects in development at all times and a small fraction ever actually make it to getting a greenlight. Even fewer actually make it to air. Phoebe Waller-Bridges made headlines a month or so back for her $60 mil deal with Amazon that so far has not resulted in anything. So again, this is not a big deal. \n\nThird, the Post is trash. Everyone should know this by now. \n\nAnd lastly, OP seems to post mostly right-wing outrage bait and never comments. So, they've got an angle. Actually, they're likely a bot as they are a 9-year-old account and have no comments more recent than 4 years ago, yet plenty of posts. \n\nEdit: Get as mad as you want. Nothing I've said is untrue. And note that nothing I've said is defending this person's qualities, only explaining the development process in tv/film (and throwing deserved shade at the Post and OP). But this is a non-story.",

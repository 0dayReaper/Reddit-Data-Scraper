When Return of the King briefly bumped The Godfather from the #1 spot on the Top 250, The Godfather boards had a ***massive*** meltdown about it, and started organizing review bombs to get Return of the King off the top 10. \n\nIt was a never-ending battle between Godfather fanboys and Shawshank Redemption fans knocking the other out of the top 10 so their favorite movie could be number one, somehow bringing a sense of fulfillment into their sad lives. And IMDb never did anything about *that* 20 years ago.",

It wasn't the worst movie ever made. It had LOLs. No other movie of equal quality across the board was ever subject to the absurd contempt it was. Hell, worse movies were treated better. \n\nPretending it wasn't spammed with bad reviews by misogynists is basically an admission that they're one of them or support it being done. A rant about how everyone doesn't have a like a movie when that's not what's being discussed is also a confession. A movie can be bad, and we agree its bad, and we acknowledge that there's lunatics attacking it for far different reasons than it's bad.",

I've seen some truly awful, politically motivated films that are quite literally just a bit of propaganda wrapped in jokes or stories, but even those aren't worthy of being called a 1/10 movie. I've seen plenty of truly awful films that I wouldn't say are worth my time, but very few are true 1/10 disasters. Shit like \"An American Carol\" which is just a lot of very dated, often bigoted, and wildly stupid jokes and talking points still managed to get a few chuckles out of me and probably lands somewhere like a 4/10 for me. Was it watchable? Yeah. Was it any good? At times. Would I sit down and watch it again? Probably not. But it has a plot that makes internal sense, the actors make a decent effort, it's shot in a professional way, and while there were some bits that were repulsive, it's still far from the worst thing I've ever seen. \n\nI understand not liking new Ghostbusters or new Star Wars, but people acting like this is the worst thing ever committed to film are not acting in good faith and they shouldn't be allowed to contribute to online movie review scores.",

Their typical deflection is \"we aren't just tired of lazy, unnecessary sequels/remakes\" or \"the movie is just bad, it's not because they're female.\"\n\nThe movie itself is quite respectful to its source. Nobody among the original cast died, retconned or got disrespected. Its an alternate universe and reimagining of the story with different characters - who just happen to be female. \n\nSure it may be boring and uninteresting, but it respects the franchise more than other sequels and reboot.",

Should  they detect patterns indicative of review bombing or illegitimate reviews and they have a fair and efficient way to account for that then I don't see why they shouldn't implement it where needed. That being said the optics are terrible. What I'm about to say is how I imagine its seen by those who are already freaking out about the casting. \"It looks like the MSM is not going to allow their woke propaganda piece to be reviewed as anything other than a triumph in cinema. It's just a bad movie, the reviews are in and they can't handle it so they are putting their fingers on the scale.\" It plays right into their conspiratorial nonsense that every institution in modern American life is out to get them and in on a plot to to turn America into a socialist gay night club. I think they should list both the review average reflective of their typical grading system and that of the modified version. I think they should list both in addition to explaining in detail how the modified ratings are tabulated. We all know that a large number of the negative reviews are based solely on who the lead actress is, no not even who she is but that she has more melanin in her skin than they can handle. Its ridiculous and we know it but I think the way it is being handled by IMDb could potentially make matters worse. All these wingnuts need is \"proof\" that their paranoia is justified. I'm sure a few are going to disagree with me - I may not have done the best job of getting my point across.",

He's kind of just along for the ride and isn't really that fleshed out (other than the first film), he's just a cool viewpoint character. But of course, people who haven't seen the old films have to critique the director who made the franchise on how he was wrong about his own film.",

And created a song that could be used as a torture device by the rapper named after a bottle of water. Not Zephyrhills ( the only water bottle brand I can think of and I have a headache and don't care to look it up.) I've heard that it was so dark on a regular theater screen that you couldn't see what was happening. I haven't seen it.\n\nEven the remakes I like were cash grabs just ones that remained more faithful to the source material (Cinderella) or told their own story in a way with an amazing cast (Alice and Wonderland).",

And efforts to scuttle the film\u2019s success has led one of the internet\u2019s largest film sites to adjust its rating system for the film.\n\nIMDb currently gives the movie a 7 out of 10 ranking, but of more than 33,000 user-submitted reviews, around 13,000 have it ranked as a one-star film in a clear review-bombing attempt\n\n\u201cOur rating mechanism has detected unusual voting activity on this title. To preserve the reliability of our rating system, an alternate weighting calculation has been applied,\u201d IMDb wrote in a note flagging \u201cunusual activity\u201d on the page. When that occurs, the site says, \u201can alternate weighting calculation may be applied in order to preserve the reliability of our system.",

Not amazing but okay.\nNow if you look at the demographics, you'll see blacks are overrepresented, more than double their % of the US population in this first weekend, also almost 70% female, with such skewed demographic numbers, mathematically, this isn't sustainable medium to long term and the numbers will drop dramatically. This does not bode well for future weekends, especially since other major releases are coming (spiderverse is one).

Some movies (ones with boys) are recognized as \u201cbad,\u201d but that\u2019s totally fine and cool. Other movies are recognized as bad, and that\u2019s totally unacceptable, and anyone with a different opinion is part of some wild conspiracy\n\nI think marvel movies are silly, simple sci-fi movies for kids with accessible themes. The reception to Captain Marvel was absolutely insane.",

It looks like shit, the CGI is crap, the original\u2019s brisk pacing is gone and vibrant visuals are largely drown out. Also I find photorealistic animals talking and emoting like humans to be unsettling. Disney, please stay away from live action remakes with talking animals. Maybe try Big Hero 6 if you must continue this unoriginality quest. Just no more talking \u201creal\u201d animals, they\u2019re nightmare fuel.",

I imagine he brought a first edition VHS version of the Lion King onset the first day of shooting, threw it at a cameraman, and said \u201cmake it exactly like this, but make the animals look terrifying.\u201d Then he drove away and wasn\u2019t seen again until the premiere.",

And you can clearly see it by just going to see a bunch of the reviews from the film which are just 1 star reviews from recently created accounts that haven't reviewed other stuff.\n\nAlso, the verified audience score and all the audience score on rotten tomatoes is also suspicious cause of the big difference between the two. And cause the Post track analisis for the film has been more in line with the verified audience score than with the all audience one.",

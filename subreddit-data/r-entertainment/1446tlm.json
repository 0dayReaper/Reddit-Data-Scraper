I'm not entitled, I just need to further understand how juicy the lambs leg, roasted in savory garlic upon a fie carefully brought to temp with the branches of a Godwood tree, seasoned slightly with salt made from the tears of the wall when it weaps. I need to know how that oil drips into the fire causing it to blaze, roasting the lamb to near perfect as the the fat mixes with the tender meats. While it's served on the breasts of a prostitute, a prostitute slathered in wine. Wine the drips between her thighs, soaking in the saltsand peppers and rosemary from a far off trading ship, a trading ship that also brought the finest silks. So when it eaten off her bronzed body and plump tits, she can be drapped in the finest purples. So the world may know that she is khaleese, mother of dragons, breaker of chains.\n\nAlso, knowing the end of the book would be pretty cool",

I think he\u2019s hoping to reward those who have been so faithfully returning to his worlds and experiences year after year with a final goodbye, trying to speak to a more concentrated audience than say a movie like Ponyo with its fairly easily marketable material. I mean,  Idont know the guy, but every interview I have seen him in he\u2019s just so passionate about animation and what it takes to make a film work that I think it\u2019s just a final send off for the people who were most dedicated to his work. Like if you wanna know about it, you\u2019d have to be interested enough to be looking already, so the audience, however small, self selects. Like Billy Joel giving out front row seats to his shows to people who bought nosebleed seats, sometimes you want that passion close to you.",

There was even a Miyazaki documentry a while ago where he said once he was gone, the studio would fall apart, it was inevitable. Miyazaki's son has been releasing these wacky films simply to sustain the studio for the last five or so years so his father could finish the film. Artists who retired from Ghibli came back to work on this. This movie needs to be a success.",

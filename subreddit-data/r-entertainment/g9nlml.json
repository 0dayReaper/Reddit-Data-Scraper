It's just incredible humor with some talented actors.\n\nThe snake scene almost killed me. As one of a few brothers myself, it was the most accurate depiction of siblings that I've ever seen. From the casual mention of sibling-induced trauma, to Loki's proud smile, that scene had me laughing hysterically, and I'm not usually a laugh-out-loud guy. I thought that maybe it was a result of being a bit tipsy when I first saw it, but nope- upon rewatches, it gets me every single time.",

Pitt convinced him to wait 2 weeks to cast the part and give him an audition before deciding. Pitt went out that day and hired an acting coach and spent the next two weeks prepping for the part. He came back and completely blew Gillliam away, and got the part.\n\nIt's the fact that Brad Pitt was humble enough to go hire an acting coach when he was THE wanted star actor that makes me respect him so much. The ego didn't go to his head, and he put in the work to get what he wanted instead of expecting it to be handed to him.",

God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables - slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war... Our great depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won't. We're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.\"",

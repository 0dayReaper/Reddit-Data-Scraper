They just don't though because it's almost never worth the risk. Even if they used their size and power to just kill it, there is little to no chance they aren't going to lose an eye or some other horrific injury. A favorite of the honey badger is too attack the groin...even if they win they lose",

The amount of juicing in Hollywood is something a lot of people aren't aware of and it's potentially a huge story if stars come out and admit it. \n\nOver the last decade or so there's a been a good amount of stories written about unrealistic body images for women, but how juicing in TV and movies has wrapped the body images for men hasn't gotten the same coverage.\n\nThe fact that many people can see these complete body transformations within a year for actors in their 40s and not immediately think of juicing shows how crazy it has gotten for what people think is an achievable for men not juicing.",

To expand on your point: The speed these movies are filmed and some of the timelines these actors have to get shredded under make it absolutely impossible to get that big/cut without some sort of \u201csupplement\u201d, even with a full-time team of trainers, nutritionalists, make up artists etc. \n\nAlso, in addition to the steroid debate, these guys are also 1000% wearing prosthetics and being photoshopped. It\u2019s funny how people won\u2019t debate a woman being photoshopped thinner (like \u201chuh yep, makes sense\u201d), but then a guy being bigger means it\u2019s HGH. Lighting, angles etc. can all make someone look bigger (cut to Chris Evans talking about him and Anthony Mackie working out right before a scene to look as swole as possible). \n\nThere are many factors at play that create this unachievable bod. I honestly think this should be a course in school explaining it so kids understand it\u2019s a costume. Because that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s not real life, or a real person, it\u2019s a super hero.",

That helps stretch out the potential consequences. \n\nOther actors have talked about regular doctor visits, like once a week on set, to help them manage the \"regime\" they're on.  They don't say it outright, they say they monitor their macros and hydration etc.  Which is probably true, in a way.\n\nWhen you're wealthy or a studio is paying, you can get tailored cocktails to manage your gains and minimize side effects. It's unrealistic for the vast majority of people, but for the upper echelons lots of stuff is possible",

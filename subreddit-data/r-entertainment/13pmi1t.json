Like it was only really Core Worlds and maybe some Mid-Rim planets that really liked them, whereas most of the others were either neutral or hated them already.\n\nEven outside of criminals you still had people who were pissed at the Jedi given the very limited help they gave people on the Outer Rim.",

It helps that these are contained experiences though, not reliant on DLC or any monetization of any kind. Almost a callback to a simpler time in gaming.\n\nGet it full price or get it on sale, either way I'd say it's worth it. Depending on how bad you want that singleplayer Jedi adventure experience. Survivor's PC version is going through some performance hiccups currently, but they are clearly working on it, and it seems to have improved from my perspective.\n\nWould highly recommend you start with Fallen Order however, if you intend to play the series.",

They\u2019re basically Dark Souls with light sabres with a sprinkle of Uncharted platforming. \n\nI beat Survivor last week and Cal has become my new favourite Jedi along with the crew of the Mantis.

There are some great stories in both and some great new characters, definitely worth playing for a Star Wars fan.

Merchandise isn't going to tell a story, and you have approximately 18 hours' worth of movies to expand on things. More now with the popularity and access to the Disney+ and the shows, but still.\n\nThe vast majority of fans are never going to pick up a book or comic or anything like that.

It has enough brand strength alone to ensure the majority of its projects are successful regardless of who is at the helm or the quality of the cinematic output.\n\nSo discussing which films were a commercial success or not is missing the point entirely. For Disney and Lucas film, it's not about projects failing to break even. It's about opportunity cost. \n\nThat a single Star Wars film at all failed to meet its financial expectations is a huge failure. This is an IP whose popularity and scale should be printing money for Disney. If it's not, there's something wrong and that needs to be addressed.",

Traditionally we saw a new movie every three years for the trilogies. Disney wanted two years instead and on top of that they wanted other Star Wars related movies released as well during this same time period.\n* Disney ignored the extended universe. Most likely because Disney tried to legally get out of royalty payments with extended universe authors. Disney arguing that the agreements these authors had did not transfer over with the purchase of Lucasfilms. Yeah, the courts didn't see it this way.\n\n\n\nThat isn't to say Kennedy isn't to blame but it does appear Disney Executives share more of the blame.",

I've never heard anyone say the tartakovsky cartoon or the dark forces games deserved to be cut. Lighthearted space fantasy with a barebones plot is the bread and butter of star wars.\n\nProblem was for every one of those you had a karen traviss whining about how everything you liked in the movies sucks and her chris kyle space marines are so much cooler (her fourth book literally starts with them in the war in iraq). Or michael stackpole writing in his homebrew warhammer 40k faction that got laughed out of his gaming group to drop an asteroid on chewie and completely destroy the state of the galaxy post rotj. Or the half dozen authors fighting tooth and nail to get luke skywalker in bed with their super cool ex imperial assassin smuggler oc-do-not-steals and shut down everyone else's attempts to do so.\n\nDisney wanted to keep most of the stuff that fit the tone of star wars, but if they only cut the dumb shit they'd have signaled to potential writers that anything they came up with was an inch away from the chopping block if they needed space for a The Force Awakens or a The Mandalorian down the line. Do that and the only people that'll write for you are people that never gave a shit about star wars in the first place. Shit like admiral thrawn and dark troopers and whatnot were never supposed to be removed permanantly. They just had to be cut out temporarily as a business decision. That's why people keep asking for things to be brought back.",

Revan\u2019s Holocron taught Bane to break away from the brothhood and take up the Darth title that was very offensive to the Brotherhood. This lead to him developing the Rule of Two from those Revan teachings. There by turning one definition of Sith (the race) into the new definition (rule of two master/apprentice) there are no other Sith. \n\nIf they bring the Sith back (in any fashion), what was the point in the Prophecy if the \u201cbalance\u201d would only last less than 30 years? Less if you account for Sidious never actually dying till Ray cleaned up the Chosen One\u2019s mess. \n\nPersonally, i wish they would just make a \u201cNew Jedi Order\u201d standalone movie that props up a new Prophecy at the end that will take place X time in the distant future, then cut the fucking cord and move the fuck on from the Skywalker name. It\u2019s been run into the ground and is being propped up by a pretender now. Not even blood related. A Palpatine.",

Luke works to rebuild the Jedi Order, Jedi Order gets twisted into another army for the Republic to abuse, he leaves and starts a journey of self discovery, finds a new path, teaches Rey when she arrives.\n\nNope, we get a whiny bitch Luke who tried to kill Han Solo's son because he was \"afraid\" of him.....\n\nLike a Grey Jedi group that doesn't get involved in any of the Jedi/Sith crap and just protects people.",

Iron man and the Incredible hulk where both written and filmed as standalone movies. It was only when the movies turned out great that they decided to make them into the Avengers. Rushing in to make some post-credit scenes to hint at the fact.\n\nIt seems like what other studios have learned from this is that in order to make a extended universe you have to set up all sorts of threads that constantly reminds the audience that there is more to come.  Make sure the audience tune in to watch all the movies so that when the big one comes out they haven't missed some critical piece of information.\n\nThe Avengers didn't need any setup, it is just a glorified sequel to 4 other individual movies. As long as you like one of them you have a reason to tune in for the Avengers. That in turn encourages them to go back and watch what they missed. Congratulations, you now have a cinematic universe. The setup has nothing to do with the success.",

That same year they dropped the Incredible Hulk that had a post credit scene with RDJ showing up continuing to set up the Avengers. The next film just two years later was 60% just setting up the Avengers with introducing Black Widow and dropping a post credit scene setting up Thor. Then we got Thor which is practically a direct prequel to the Avengers. And then finally we had Captain America: First Avenger which not only had the word \u201cAvenger\u201d in its name but it\u2019s post credit scene is literally a trailer of the next movie\n\nDude I don\u2019t know what you were smoking because all of phase 1 was building a larger cinematic universe.

And isn\u2019t the audience score for the new Transformers pretty high?\n\nIdk what Paramount is doing with the Hasbro IP, but I bet Hasbro is pretty pissed about it. Dungeons and Dragons was great, but they released it a week before Mario. Transformers released a week after Spiderverse and during a packed summer. I bet they just want them to lose money so Paramount can take a tax write off. \n\nHasbro should just should just shift their focus on getting one franchise off the ground. No one\u2019s going to have faith in their good products if they\u2019re sandwiched in between terrible adaptations of Power Rangers, GI Joe, My Little Pony, Battleship, etc.\n\nEdit: While we\u2019re on the subject of the Hasbro cinematic universe, how pissed do you think they\u2018ve got to be that the Knives Out franchise is basically becoming what they probably wish they could\u2019ve done with Clue?",

That\u2019s how Fox\u2019s \u201c21 Jump Street\u201d wound up at Sony. \n\nAnother example of this is Warren Beatty sometimes appearing in interviews as \u201cDick Tracy\u201d to hold onto the film rights. \n\nhttps://consequence.net/2023/02/warren-beatty-dick-tracy-rights-tcm-special/amp/\n\nWhile I agree that not every I.P. needs to be an extended universe, studios often have to look at greenlighting a movie as a commitment to start a franchise if they want to keep the rights.",

Both use Star Wars as a setting for a great story. \n\nLucas, I think, has learned this lesson, and we will be seeing better content moving forwards. At least I hope so!",

Now, they\u2019re making animated Ninja Turtles, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see a ton of other IP movies popping up in the next couple of years trying to emulate the style of Spiderverse. \n\nIf you want to launch a new successful Cinematic Universe based on IP you\u2019re going to have to take a risk on creating a unique blueprint.

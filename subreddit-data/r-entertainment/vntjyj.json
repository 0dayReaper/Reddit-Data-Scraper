Not even once. \n\nAt one point, I actually went to  few of my pastors and asked why they never brought up that sin, but loved to harp on things like homosexuality and abortion. They saw nothing wrong with that. They\u2019d usually say some cop out like \u201cit\u2019s just a necessary evil\u201d or something and change the subject.\n\nThat was when I really started questioning how picky and choosey American evangelicals are with the Bible. It\u2019s the highest hypocrisy to ignore the purported word of god on a matter of justice for the poor and disenfranchised, while enforcing your personal beliefs on subjects like abortion, where the Bible doesn\u2019t even say a word against it, despite it being a known practice in ancient times. \n\nI have lost all respect for this group of people.

They decided it was okay to charge interest, so long as the person borrowing the money was a Jew. This started well before the pre-reformation period you\u2019re talking about. \n\nEurope has been anti-Semitic for a *loooooooooooongg* time. They hated the Jews with a passion. The term \u201cghetto\u201d was created to describe the, typically poor, neighborhoods that Jews were forcibly confined to in some European areas. \n\nBut, Christians discovered the Jews had created a usable loophole! Now Christians could borrow money without needing to make other Christians sin! Great times were had by all! \n\nUntil somebody realized all the banks were run by Jews who had gotten rich by charging interest on loans. This is the origin of the \u201cJews are cheap\u201d, \u201cJews steal money\u201d, \u201cJews run the banks\u201d, and \u201cJews are secretly in charge of everything because they\u2019re all mega rich\u201d stereotypes. All of which had some basis in reality as many European banks were run by Jews who had gotten rich by charging interest on loans. \n\nThus, Christianity created their own loophole, but in typical Christian fashion: they just ignored the multiple, multiple explicit orders from their god to never charge interest. \n\nModern anti-Semitism is rooted in medieval European Christianity.",

You may charge a foreigner interest, but you may not charge your brother interest, that the Lord your God may bless you in all that you undertake in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s superseded by Jesus himself in Luke 6:34-35: \u201cAnd if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to get back the same amount. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil.\u201d\n\nThe *Bible* teaches that you will lend out money without interest to anyone who asks, regardless of the reason. The *Torah* teaches that you may lend money with interest to all non-Jews. \n\nIn fact, you cannot find a single time that \u201cbrother\u201d is used by **Jesus** to specifically refer to believers. That is a strictly Old Testament, and therefore strictly Jewish, usage. But even the Jewish usage is backed by references to \u201cforeigners\u201d and Gentiles. \n\nIt is 100% Biblical and Christian to say that usury is a sin in all circumstances. You are telling lies, though perhaps not intentionally so. \n\nYou\u2019re on the fucking internet. The Bible has been cross referenced and indexed in every possible way you can imagine. Stop assuming you know any-goddamn-thing and start looking shit up before spreading lies.",

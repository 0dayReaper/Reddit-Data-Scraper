There are no major hot wars going on (sorry but Ukraine is a scuffle in historical terms), no wave of assassinations or empires changing hands; technologically we're post-internet and pre-whatever's next; artistically we're largely captured by corporations and making safe/boring stuff; our grandchildren will know as much about covid as we knew about the 1918 flu growing up; most of what's going on that seems so epic and historical is really just gossip. We had a crimey president... but we've had crimey presidents before and no one remembers them. History cares about war, art, ideology, and technology, and those aren't terribly interesting right now.",

Have we ever been good at administration? Have we ever had a timespan longer than a decade or two where the people in power weren\u2019t falling victim to basic human selfishness and clan bias? I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re necessarily wrong, but I don\u2019t see any way that this is much shittier of a time for aliens to get here than the past would\u2019ve been, and we have enough understanding of the world around us to probably not immediately assume that they\u2019re gods. This timeline has been stupid for millennia, and every era of culture is just as stupid for thinking they got it figured out, but I think circumstances would have been waaaay worse for first contact even one century ago.",

Some white girl is standing with her church group in front of the white house during some protest. She shouts the slogan from her sign \u201cIt\u2019s GOD. Not ALLAH\u201d. My youth pastor was doing his casual coaching of trying to teach us that other religions were bad (because Church shouldn\u2019t be about self-reflecting and helping your neighbor, it should be about creating potential mass shooters who think education is for the birds). He was saying the girl protesting was \u201ca true warrior for God.\u201d\n\nI wish I would have spoken up, but on the way home I was talking with my Mom and said I didn\u2019t like today\u2019s lesson in the youth group. When she asked why I said \u201cbecause my pastor is an idiot and doesnt know that God and Allah are the same. If these religions and their spawn point is Abraham, then this infighting is REALLY stupid and means we aren\u2019t welcoming everyone.\u201d My mom said \u201cYour youth pastor is an idiot, just tune it out when he gets like that.\u201d I didn\u2019t like that answer either.\n\nThe very next week my youth pastor made some huge negative generalizations about single mothers, of which my mom is one due to my dad dying when I was really little. I stopped going to church after that. We weren\u2019t the only church acting that way at the time and a lot of denominations were going the hellfire and brimstone routes again. I figured if Jesus were real and ever did return, I\u2019m pretty sure there would be a mass church arson event because flipping the tables over in his dad\u2019s house wouldn\u2019t cut it this time.",

All this stuff with banning books and having their followers redirect their attention to drag queens is a way to keep them distracted and keep them in the dark. Religious leaders use this power to bend their followers to their will. To do their bidding.\n\nPriests and preachers are basically robbing their followers from under their noses. I remember the priest at my church having a more expensive car than over half of the congregants.\n\nWhen I think of a model Christian, I think of people like Mr. Rogers. I grew up on him. Sadly, today's Christian just promotes hate on anyone who isn't like them and doesn't believe the exact same thing as them. They don't worship god. They worship wolves in sheep's clothing.",

He is the closest embodiment to Christian tenants that I\u2019ve ever known. He took \u201cLove thy neighbor\u201d and RAN with it.\n\nHe also disliked people praising him like this because to him this was easy and we should all be helping each other and giving our best for ourselves and our community. Its one of those situations where he earned the prestige he had then and holds now posthumously both by his actions and because he didn\u2019t want a title.",

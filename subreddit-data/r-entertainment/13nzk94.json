Also, I went into EEAAO with low expectations after my father said he left the theaters after a half an hour when he went. It wasn\u2019t *that* bad, though. I could see giving up on it if you are watching at home. \n\nIt\u2019s a concept film, and I just didn\u2019t like pretty much everything the filmmakers were doing. I didn\u2019t even think Ke Huy Quan accomplished any sort of acting feat by any means, either. I truly believe his hype came from the classic American \u201ccomeback hero\u201d angle.\n\nIt\u2019s just that I prefer stereotypical Oscar-worthy dramas.

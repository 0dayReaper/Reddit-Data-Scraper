It was set to be their flagship show with spin offs already planned, contracts already signed and what not. This renewal isn't new and doesn't reflect the show's so called success. Joe Russo is now the sole director. That's the only change. The show is still an expensive dud. And this is just PR to make people think the renewal is based on the show's success and hours watched.",

            "comment": "Citadel\u00a0will be back for another go-round.\u00a0Prime Video\u00a0has renewed the hit global spy thriller, starring\u00a0Richard Madden\u00a0and\u00a0Priyanka Chopra Jonas, for a second season. Joe Russo is set to direct every episode of Season 2 and David Weil will be returning as showrunner on the series, which also features Lesley Manville and Stanley Tucci.\n\nThe renewal, which had been expected, follows strong viewership for Season 1. According to Prime Video,\u00a0Citadel, which hails from\u00a0Amazon\u00a0Studios and the Russo Brothers\u2019 AGBO, is the streamer\u2019s most-watched new original series outside the U.S., and fourth most-watched worldwide. All episodes of the series\u2019 first season will be available to Prime Video customers beginning May 26.\n\nAs we\u00a0previously reported, according to a source close to the production,\u00a0Citadel\u00a0followed only Prime Video\u2019s\u00a0LOTR: Rings Of Power\u00a0in launch numbers since its April 28 debut.\n\n\u201cCitadel\u00a0is a truly global phenomenon,\u201d said Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon and MGM Studios. \u201cOur goal was always to create a new franchise rooted in original IP that would grow Prime Video\u2019s international audience. This show has drawn an outsize number of new international customers to Prime Video. Its massive worldwide debut audience is a testament to Joe and Anthony Russo\u2019s remarkable vision, the incredible talents of Richard Madden, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Lesley Manville and Stanley Tucci, and the tireless work of the creative teams, cast, and crew. Given the overwhelming number of our customers who have embraced this show, we are not only thrilled to share the premiere episode of\u00a0Citadel\u00a0globally without membership, but also confirm that the series will return for a second season.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe first episode of Season 1 will be free to stream without membership on both Prime Video and ad-supported Amazon Freevee for a limited time. Domestically, the premiere episode will stream for one month on Amazon Freevee beginning Friday, May 26. Outside of the U.S., the first episode\u00a0will be available to stream without a Prime membership on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories from Friday-Sunday, May 26-28.\n\n\u201cAGBO is thrilled to embark on this next phase of the spyverse with Jen, Vernon, and the entire team at Amazon,\u201d said executive producers Anthony and Joe Russo. \u201cThe innovative storytelling of\u00a0Citadel\u00a0has paved the way for an incredible, worldwide collaboration with creatives in front of and behind the camera.\u201d",

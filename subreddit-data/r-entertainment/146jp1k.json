The whole \u201cvaccines cause aurism\u201d movement started and was primarily happening with the left and the groups of liberal mommies who would have chicken pox parties in blue states/cities. \n\nSame with a lot of the culture wars. Back in the 80\u2019s-90\u2019s it was the liberals like Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton and Joe Lieberman who were freaking out and going flat out with the culture wars and codes bigotry and \u201csave the children\u201d bullshit with the satanic panic pedophile bullshit and hearings on gangsta rap music and war on video games. \n\n[It was our favorite liberal environmentalist Al Gore\u2019s wife Tipper who started the war on music and is responsible for the parental advisory stickers on CDs/Casettes/Music.](https://daily.jstor.org/parental-advisory-the-story-of-a-warning-label/) \n\nHer victory over the recording industry and the creation of the parental advisory sticker for music was the blueprint for Joe Lieberman\u2019s war on video games and the creation of the ESRB and ratings/stickers for video games. \n\nAll these crazy people still exist, they still have the same beliefs, and they\u2019re still Democrats who would never vote for Trump. \n\nAnd now the Republicans are giving them another option so they can siphon their votes away from Biden. \n\nThat\u2019s the entire purpose of the RFK Jr. presidential candidacy. \n\nThe elections have been so close in swing states that even a few thousand people voting for RFK in a purple state rather than Biden can swing the entire election for Trump. \n\nAnd then you also have a lot of antivaxxers in some isolated orthodox and Hasidic Jewish communities that haven\u2019t fully crossed to the right wing and the GQP and who see the *actual Nazis* supporting the far-right and Trump and RFK seems tailor-made to appeal to them. The Kennedy name has always been very strong in pretty much all the Jewish communities. \n\nAnd the orthodox/hasids and more extremist members of my Jewish community are very closed off and uneducated. \n\nMost American Jews are Reform Jews or Conservative Jews that put a huge importance on doing well in school and learning and attending institutes of higher education and obtaining advanced degrees and becoming lawyers and doctors and academics, who usually have smaller families often limited to two children.\n\nWhereas the more extremist groups of orthodox, and moreso the Hasidics often live in isolated communities and put their kids in schools that prioritize learning about Judaism over a normal education and often either don\u2019t work at all and subsist off government benefits or have small businesses with low incomes mostly providing goods and services nearly exclusively to only their isolated communities. \n\nThey shun modern technology and the internet and there is an entire economy built around buying and selling gimped custom cell phones that have extremely limited or nonexistent online capabilities. They consume very little information from the outside world, like the Amish and others, and focus almost exclusively on their isolated communities and/or Israel. \n\nThey\u2019re another group that might me more ideologically in-line with conservatives and the far right, but who would probably be apprehensive to vote for Trump when he\u2019s being propped up by, again, *literal Nazis* waving Nazi flags next to Trump flags. They\u2019re another perfect group to siphon votes from Biden using RFK. They might even sit out the vote if not for RFK being a perfect candidate to appeal to them. \n\nThis all is what RFK running is really about.",

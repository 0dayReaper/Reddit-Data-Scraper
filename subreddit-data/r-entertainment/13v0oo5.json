Depp made over $55 mil from one of the Pirates films *alone*. His usual paycheck is $20 mil per project and a percentage of the gross, and given that his films since the first Pirates have grossed billions and his percentage includes continuing income from all of them, safe to say he\u2019s far from destitute. \n\nYeah, he\u2019s blown through hundreds of millions because of his spending habits, but a cursory google search shows from reputable sources that his net worth in 2023 is estimated at approx. $150 million. \n\nBut hey, if it makes you smile to think he\u2019s penniless, you\u2019re the master of your own imagination, king.

Despite that, he *still* has over $150 million left. He is not \u2018broke\u2019.\n\nEdit: Since you like articles\n\nhttps://caknowledge.com/johnny-depp-net-worth/",

The first real turning point was the unsealed documents from the trial, which his fans bought hoping to dig up dirt about Amber, only it was filled with dirt about him instead. Awful texts with Marilyn Manson about their fantasies of a Salo inspired cave, racial slurs, Manson's abuse against his wife etc. Him wanting to falsely accuse Amber of vehicular homocide, trying to accuse her of being a stripper and wanting to put nude photos of her in the evidence. Also a lot of his support was astroturfing to begin with.",

DARVO is when an abuser tries to use any self-defense or retaliation to paint the victim as the ''real'' abuser. Like even 300 DV experts have signed an open letter about how bad the whole thing is in support of Amber. Depp already lost a case in the UK when he sued the Sun for defamation and lost on 12 accounts of proven abuse against her by their civil standard which makes calling him a wifebeater in the UK not defamation on account of it being the truth. There was evidence of him headbutting her, texts from his assistant about Depp kicking her, texts about all the damage he did, he also constantly lied about the judge about his sobriety. They did a lot of nasty tactics in the US trial, getting a best friend of his lawyer to do an incredible unethical and wrong BPD diagnosis, hiding the assistant from subpoena (UK citizen) making evidence surrounding him unusable. His lawyer was removed from the US case for leaking edited clips and private info to social media personalities and in the UK case he intimidated a witness. He also has very interesting ties to the Russian misinformation campaign since he is also a lobbyist for Oleg Deripaska.",

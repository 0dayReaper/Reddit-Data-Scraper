Things like abortion, feminism, homosexuality, Hinduism, and Islam. And he built up a cultish idea with many in the American Religious right that a component of salvation and their spiritual standing was ties towards fighting back these evils.\n\nSo some, but not all, of the religious tension in this country can be attributed to him.\n\nHe also, in this line, said some absolutely horrible things about the victims of 9/11 (i.e. they deserved it for not being good Christians and because America was not Christian enough) and Hurricane Katrina. And he also allegedly had business dealings with some African war criminals.\n\nAll in all, the first modern televangelist who made quite a fortune off convincing people that hatred was the path to spiritual salvation. A truly, genuinely horrible person.",

I am 100% convinced he did this to anger me, any other time he watched our daughter, he would be out the door as soon as we got home. \n\nMe and him had already had a long history of fights over my differing religious and general beliefs at that point, so he knew I did not want him sitting in my living room watching this asshole on my TV. He also lives 3 minutes down the road, so he would not miss much on the drive home. I used to just take my baby and retreat elsewhere until he left, he was doing us a favor so I did not even acknowledge it but found alternative child care quick. \n\nAnyway, glad this asshole is no longer around. Fuck him and his contribution to religious conservatism and it\u2019s effects on the downward spiral the US in quickly headed. \n\nAs an aside\u2014my FIL never watched any of our kids again. Mostly because of his severe drinking problem, but also we want to keep our children away from his fucked up beliefs. We are very low contact now.",

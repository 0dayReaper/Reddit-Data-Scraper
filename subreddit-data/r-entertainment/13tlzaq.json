Especially because than you could be pressuring gay/bi actors to come out in real life (this has happened in the literary world, where writers of unknown sexuality write about gay characters and then get yelled at on Twitter about it until they're forced to come out), and sorry to say that still has consequences in Hollywood. You will get typecast and not offered as many roles. \n\nCan a straight actor convincingly portray being in love or lust with a straight actress, even when both are not attracted to each other in real life? Yes [sometimes]. So why would it be different if it was two straight actors or two straight actresses playing gay couple? If they have chemistry, are well acted, that's all I care about. Let ScarJo play a lesbian if she wants, or Henry Cavill a gay dude. Please. No really please I would enjoy that very much please and thank you.",

In fighting for equality they get so caught up in the fight that they don't think about what things should look like at the end nor when they need to change how they fight/stop fighting.\n\n In the beginning you have to force it down people's throats because otherwise they throw it in the gutter. But eventually you have to pull back and allow for nuance. Like here where there's no proprietary method of drag themed makeup. It's freely admitted, done well, and even done by a professional. Equality here is the representation not the explicit inclusion of an lgtb+ person just because.\n\nAcceptance is happening here without exclusion. And people fighting for equality forget that at some point you go from punching up to just straight up punching. At some point you aren't creating a safe space, or forcing inclusion (necessary steps along the way) but forcing *exclusion*.",

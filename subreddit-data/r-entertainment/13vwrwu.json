It has been chopped up and paraphrased for clickbait. \n\nFor example the full quote is more of a criticism of Hollywood not having enough young male American actors. The character in his new film died in his late 30s, but he doesn't know who to cast. \n\nThe interviewer asks if he'd cast a British person instead and he says no because while they are great actors, he doesn't want an actor who the first thing he has to do is change his voice unnaturally. \n\nThe full context of the quote makes a lot of sense. Its a very American story about a very American man, some weirdo who wrote porn reviews! \n\nIt was the same with Ryan Reynolds quote. Tarrantino said his movies dont exist in the zeitgeist, they are filler for streamers. The headline is \"ryan reynolds movies dont exist\"",

People of colour have to deal with (structural) racism and generally speaking have less roles within a film than white people, and that amount becomes smaller due to white washing (as you take a character of colour and make them white).\n\nMeanwhile, an American or British accent won't make you the target of oppression and/or bigotry.\n\nFurthermore, Tarantino is talking about British actors playing American characters (with American accents). He is not talking about British actors taking American roles and making those characters British. So if you have to draw a race analogy (which you shouldn't because the two aren't comparable) , you should compare it to blackface.",

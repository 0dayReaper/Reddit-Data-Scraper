The writing and directing is always lacking since the studio is so stringent about what they allow their creatives to do, but the actors put in performances that elevate the source material. \n\nYou really see it in the Disney+ content. Oscar Isaac, Hailee Steinfeld, and Tatiana Maslany keep otherwise bad project afloat. Anthony Mackie is a good example of what happens when a mediocre actor is cast in the lead role.",

Whether it's past, present or future Thanos, that's still *Thanos* in front of them.  This is the badass motherfucker who took away everything from the Avengers and mostly genocide'd the universe. They had *already lost* to him. Up to that point, the Avengers had never actually lost, until this guy came in and stomped them with ease. And now, Thanos is alive again and right in front of them? It's literally their worst nightmare. And on top of that, it's an even more merciless Thanos. In IW, he tells the Avengers that half of all life will be spared. This time? He says he's wiping out everything. \n\nAnd on the opposite end, this Thanos knows the Avengers are dangerous. That's why he doesn't fuck around and comes at them full force. And he almost won *again* if not for a last minute Hail Mary by Stark. \n\nThe connection is there. It's built in. You'd have to have a fundamental misunderstanding to think otherwise.\n\nSaying there's no emotional connection between the Avengers and Thanos in Endgame is like saying there's none between the Guardians/Quill and displaced Gamora in GotG 3 which is completely inaccurate (not to mention it's probably the strongest story aspect in 3). The history is still there even if the characters themselves aren't the same.",

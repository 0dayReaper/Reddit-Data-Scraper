            "comment": "&gt; In a new interview, director Taika Waititi told all about the struggles he has felt when developing his upcoming Star Wars story. \n\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019ve got a really good idea for it.. It\u2019s just as with all films, it\u2019s this middle part. You\u2019re like, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen?\u2019 And then you look at all of those films that are so great, you\u2019re like, \u2018Well, I guess they can\u2019t meet some smuggler with an alien sidekick.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to THR, **Waititi has been working on a Star Wars script for *three* years.**",

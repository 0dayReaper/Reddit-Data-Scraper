The free market is like the animal kingdom; survival of the fittest.  anti-trust regulations are analogous to logic and reason which is missing in nature.  It just forces a balance that is more sustainable in the long run for society as a whole.  Of course, that may not be in the best interest of the very few biggest animals/corporations but it is for *everyone else*.  So we have to violate that animal instinct to protect society as a whole.  That is it, really.\n\nDean Norris has a point, albeit his statement is pretty vague so who knows exactly what he is trying to say.  Yeah, if you don't like regulation then 'stfu about gas prices'.  That makes sense.",

Every supporting piece likewise mutates to support the status quo.\n\nCapitalism as an ideology and as an economic system is cancerous.  Not in a meme sense even (though it is that too);\n\nInfinite growth and continuous, growing wealth extraction on a planet with finite resources is no different than a cell in your body mutating and growing unabated.  Even if you had \u201cregulations\u201d for the cancer in your body, only a lunatic would claim it\u2019s a \u201chealthy cancer\u201d.\n\nBy the way, capitalism hates free markets.  What do shareholders (ie. capitalists) want?  They want higher share amounts.  They want more wealth.  What limits or cuts into profit/wealth?  Competition.  Free markets.\n\nLike how is this not obvious?",

A family of 4 isn't going to use a bus when they can pay \u00a33, get everything done, instead of over \u00a310 including kid's tickets.\n\n\nHigher parking fees / congestion charges / integrated public transport (I can't use the same day ticket on all buses in my city as there are three competing companies, so it often works out cheaper to take a cab, which is UGH).",

If you leave things in public ownership and nobody is making a huge profit.... it's a missed opportunity for them!\n\n\n\nAfter WWII the US loaned a bunch of countries money, including Italy, with the intention of bringing them into capitalism and away from communism. Luring Olivetti, Fiat etc into their markets offered a short term good feeling of success, ooh look, if we're productive we can earn LOADS! Our national economy is exporting all these typewriters and cars, and individual people get to keep the profits! Thank goodness the socialists aren't in charge.\n\n\nWhen you allow public ownership/municipalisation, things like bus routes can be run according to need - smaller, less profitable routes that could transport people to work, shops etc, cutting carbon output, have been stopped because only a handful of passengers need them and... Well, fiat aren't the only car company. And of course, politicians are allowed to own stocks and shares!

They had video footage of this warehouse of workers that were working in horrible conditions, making essentially nothing at all, and damn near starved. They showed the footage to a person who was leaving the store and asked if they knew things they were buying were supporting this and they were totally shocked and upset...for 2 seconds. Then she said \"I feel for those people but I got kids and they need pants and I can't afford to buy from someone else\". \n\nAnd what do you do? The machine has set it up so poor people have to exploit foreign labor to clothe their kids. It's horrible",

Its a tough pill to swallow realizing that I was a brick/cog in something as harmful as the republican party is, and I would have expected myself to have more integrity then I did back then, and to realize what I really was a part of. I think a lot of people here don\u2019t realize how easy it is to fall into a complacent mindset when everyone around you treats it as if there nothing wrong with the (R) actions and shuns anyone who thinks different. Especially folks who are trying to fit in, at a young age it becomes part of your identity. Anyways the only amends I can do now is is vote and volunteer for dems, but there is also a lot still wrong with the democratic party. That being said at least dems try to do better and while it is slow I feel a desperate hope that maybe we can see some real changes to campaign finance laws, civil rights, etc so its not even a real choice in my eyes. Maybe one day after the republican party gets deprogramed it can be but until then there is only one moral and intelligent choice.",

Technically I probably transitioned out of the Republican party sometime during my time in the Army, but I joined in 01 and left in 05 so there was only one election I was able to participate in, and good Ol' Bush Jr decided to make sure I couldn't vote.\n\nVoted Democrat ever since. The more I learn, the more firmly that conviction holds.\n\nI want a group of parties so I can vote my more individual interests but that's not how our system works, and I'll be damned If I'm going to vote for literal insurrectionists and traitors.\n\nNo hyperole, there, 1/6 was an act of war on this nation to keep a deranged president in power, that thankfully failed. It was still fucking rebellion and the people involved are traitors in my eyes, every bit as much as those Confederate fucks from the 1860s.",

Yes, thank you, I get that not EVERY SINGLE PERSON has access to alternate transport methods. The broad comparison between the two countries was just that: broad. Americans have rural citizens too.

Free market or laissez faire capitalism is a kind of capitalism, but capitalism does not automatically mean free market. Government regulation is also not incompatible with capitalism, only free market capitalism specifically.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of nuance that is lost on people who get all upset about the free market.\n\n(Also people probably don\u2019t realize that pure free market capitalism would mean not establishing tariffs, not blocking foreign companies, and not protecting US ones. That\u2019s protectionist government interference and not free market! That probably also doesn\u2019t align with what some Redditors think free markets mean.)",

It's just fuckin' fabulous when CeCe is cheating on her man because some wannabe DJ ogre lookin' fuck introduced her to mdma and she loses her job because she's partying on the weekend and can't recover in time for work. And WOW it's so fun when your friends are shitting themselves because their supply dried up and all of a sudden they're graduating from pills to needles. Oh yeah and Dale isn't around anymore because his tolerance was too fucking high and benzos started sounding like a grand idea to keep the party going right up until he choked on his own vomit.",

Those two are the absolute peak of the show (and really the only great episodes), it\u2019s mind boggling to me that he didn\u2019t fully hand the reins to those writers after that. He can stay in charge of the visuals but get someone else on that keyboard sam!",

It creates a lot of drama that feels much less contrived than a typical teen drama show. The teens poor decisions come from self loathing and traumatic childhoods. There is an entire episode that is a conversation between an adict and their sponsor. But it is also absurd because the situations are so amplified and ridiculous, as well. If these characters made better choices it would be a fairly boring show. I watch it because I love the filmmaking but I quickly realized how much it influenced my college aged students. This show is much like how teens read Romeo and juliet as romantic and adults view it as stupid teens making poor choices because they feel trapped by the toxicity of their family. As an adult watching it I feel incredibly uncomfortable how sexual these teen characters are behaving but my students idolize them as an awesome fantasy. I still find it entertaining but not for the same reasons the target audience does.",

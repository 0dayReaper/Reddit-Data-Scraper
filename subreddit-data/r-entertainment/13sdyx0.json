But the company only sought FDA approval in early 2022 and the agency rejected the application, seven current and former employees told Reuters in March.\n\n&gt;The FDA had pointed out several concerns to Neuralink that needed to be addressed before sanctioning human trials, according to the employees. Major issues involved the lithium battery of the device, the possibility of the implant's wires migrating within the brain, and the challenge of safely extracting the device without damaging brain tissue.\n\nThe article this is from is saying they literally only recently got FDA approval to begin human trials. \n\nThat is a long, long way off from saying this could possibly cure her rare, niche disorder. It's too late for her specifically with this tech, it's too new.",

[Producer] Amy Pascal is like my mom. I was supposed to go with her [to the premiere] as her date, I couldn\u2019t go because I\u2019m here working. But I\u2019m incredibly proud of them, I\u2019m excited for the second one. I\u2019m sure it will live up to every expectation, and I can\u2019t wait to see it.\u201d",

I think there could have been a good movie in there somewhere but as you say, the way it was edited together just ended up being a long slog with no real story.

King Pin alone is a stunning piece of design. The acting is tremendous. And it's hilarious every time it wants to be.\n\nJust the reveal of Doc Ock is absolutely tone perfect, familiar yet surprising and Peter (B.) gets off some sublime quips which relate that he led himself into the same corner the audience did.\n\nIt shows a new Spider-Man who represents the bridge and tunnel crowd of the 2000s and does it without tossing Peter Parker aside.\n\nAnd it's Stan Lee's last appearance, explaining what always made Spider-Man so popular.\n\nAs others said here, it's possibly the perfect Spider-Man movie. It's hard to imagine topping it.\n\n- signed, Gwanda.",

Seeing him take on the mentor role or a elder, married, more seasoned Peter would be hard for him to pull off in terms of looks, but I would like to see him try nonetheless.

            "comment": "&gt; The upcoming Apple TV+ miniseries features Rossum as Candy, the mother of suspected criminal Danny Sullivan, played by Tom Holland. Rossum, 36, is only 10 years older than Holland, but she isn't irked by that, reasoning that Candy is meant to be a young mother.\n\n\n&gt; \"It makes sense when I read the script,\" the Shameless and Angelyne alum told Entertainment Tonight. \"Candy's a super young mom, she's almost a child in her own right when she becomes pregnant at age 16. You watch as I age from 25 to 35, which is actually younger than I am now.\"\n\n\n&gt; Premiering June 9 and inspired by a true story, 'The Crowded Room' is a psychological thriller set in New York City in the summer of 1979. It follows Holland's antisocial teen as he's arrested after a shooting at the Rockefeller Center. Through a series of discussions with investigator Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried), Danny comes to better understand his own mental health, the people in his life, and the tragic events that led up to the incident.",

You can't hold musicians accountable for shitty fanbases when they actively try to chase them away.  Waters did the same.  in the Flesh, the mentioned song, is about a person's descent into insanity and subsequently fascism.  It is literally making fun of the absurdities of fascism and it can't be much more clear.",

His use of the regalia in old shows was a part of this performance and show the ease at which we can all fall into comfortable evils.  I'm not sure what he's up to now, as I don't particularly like how he feels the need to antagonize and haven't followed him, but I do think it's important to separate between having Nazi memorabilia for fun as opposed to as a part of his performance of the Wall.\n\nTLDR, if people are referring to his usage of Nazi memorabilia in his depictions of the Wall, and angry because of it, people are silly.",

The message is timeless and it was always a good way of selling his point that isolation and loneliness breed hate.  Taking the fascist aspects out of the Wall completely kills any message it had.  I get why people would look at it with a weary eye, but anyone who actually is a Floyd fan would understand it's pertinent to the message of the album, and very specifically that song.\n\nHell, that song in of itself is relatively problematic at face value, the entire introduction uses slurs and demands people be shot.  Is that, even when showing the absurdity of Fascist ideology, not okay?  I get being uncomfortable, but this is silly sensationalist anger.\n\nAs a side note, I'd also say the new rise of Fascism and Nationalism from that place of loneliness and self isolation shows that the album is not a 40 year old relic.  It's more pertinent at this moment than it was at it's release.",

It's an uncomfortable comparison, but it's hardly anti-Semitic.  Additionally, the song In the Flesh actively mocks the absurdities of Fascism while simultaneously showing how easy it is to slip into when you isolate yourself.  It's telling people to grow up and break the artificial walls they put up around themselves.\n\nWaters' take on the Ukrainian war is utter trash and should be attacked, but not his consistent stance of the evils of Fascism.",

Which is why all the films made by streamers look so flat and same-y and don\u2019t resonate with people.",

It is much easier to sell viewers in an actor than in production values, especially whenever the only exposure you get is seeing a title card mixed in among hundreds of others on Netflix\u2019s home page.\n\nTik Tok should become the new standard for discovery, and link us out to go watch the long form we actually are interested in. Think of all the movie/tv show clips that have taken hold in the age of Tik Tok or YT shorts, now all they have to do is convert those \u201cloops\u201d into views for the actual, profit-producing, long form content",

Being able to watch something whenever can be nice but it also makes it totally disposable. If it\u2019s in theaters? There\u2019s a shine to that. Even if you miss it in theaters, when it gets around to streaming it\u2019s still shinier and becomes a higher priority viewing. If it\u2019s straight to streaming? Who cares. Idk *why* this perception of streaming movies vs theater movies is a thing, but it just\u2026is.",

I can also pause and rewind so I can get a full experience of the film. \n\nThere are times I want the communal experience, with other people watching with me. But other times, if it is a serious film, I want to watch it alone. So, from a consumer perspective, the current system works better for me. I can hardly tell which movies had a theatrical release or if they went straight to streaming. \n\nThe studios need to figure out the financial side, but I'm spending more than $100 a month for streaming services, which is more than I was spending 20 years ago for movies. The money should be there, so that's their problem.",

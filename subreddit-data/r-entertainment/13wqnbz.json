This lady doesn\u2019t match that for me. Anyway back to your question, I have come across two schools of thought. 1 - they are using their children to make themselves more relevant and you can prove that with how much media attention trans or non binary children get regardless if it is negative or positive. 2 - Non binary or trans children are more common than we think. It sure seems like there are a lot more that people think. \n\nIdk what to think, I\u2019m from LA and I know a couple people who have told me that their kid or a relative is non binary. One of those people told me how funny she thinks it is that her daughter (now son? Idk their gender identity anymore because she told me it has changed a couple times) was very proud of the fact that no one could placer her gender correctly and enjoyed that people were uncomfortable when trying to figure it out. To me it sounds like this kid is trying to be edgy and using gender identity to make people uncomfortable. I\u2019m sure people who actually struggle with this wouldn\u2019t find it funny. \n\nThe other kid I know about simply wants to be identified as he/him now and changed his name. I met him not that long ago, he\u2019s probably 15 and seems to be a quiet kid just trying to figure things out and doesn\u2019t like wearing traditional girls clothes. Someone we might call \u201ctomboy\u201d when I was in high school 2008-2012. My wife was a tomboy her whole life and has always struggled with her identity as a whole and fitting into what a woman/girl \u201cshould\u201d look like. I\u2019m pretty confident if she was a teenager now it would be even more confusing with how gender identity is now. From my personal experience one kid appears to like making people feel uncomfortable using their gender and the other kid is figuring things out. Celebrities have a lot of attention to gain when they claim their child is non binary or trans, would you give this lady a second thought if her kid wasn\u2019t non binary?",

I don't get how someone can 'not align' with either male or female when I personally feel like we've moved past placing restrictions on what either can do. \n\nBut maybe I've got this all wrong, admittedly I don't understand much about it.",

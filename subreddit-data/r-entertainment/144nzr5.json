The content is barely educational, over dramatic, whiny, loud, flashy.\n\nIt's entertainment for kids growing up with TikTok. Constant change to keep the viewer engaged.\n\nI am sure the stuff I watched as a kid may have annoyed my parents, but I still maintain that it was more simple in it's presentation and execution.",

I don't understand why people make such a big deal out of it- 'scrubbing it' from the internet makes it where a kid doesn't accidentally come across it. But certain people are determined to keep bringing it up as if it defines him as a person.\n\n\nHis blippi videos are an example of kindness and curiosity to kids.",

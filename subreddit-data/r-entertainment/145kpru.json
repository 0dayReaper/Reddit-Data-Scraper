It was hard to follow at first but I followed trough and now understand it fully.\n\nIf you dont like movies that you need to rewatch to understand then you are not the audience for this film.\nI like these type of movies very much so that is not a problem for me.\n\nI would even argue rewatching it so you can understand it next time is kinda a theme in the movie. The first time you expierence the movie as the protagonist. Once you know what is about to happen you have become the Neil of the viewing experience. \n\nNow the scene that makes this movie for me is pretty easy to miss because you probably or perharps dont know what is going yet on the first viewing. The scene in question contains a beatiful layered storypoint.\n\nThe scene is the scene where they are on the big open field up on that plateau and saying goodbye to each other. \n\nThe uniquess of its concept allow for an interesting scenario that is also quite touching.\n\nIn the scene Neil goes on the helicopter to go back in time to sacrifise himself for the protagonist. He is walking to his own death and he knows it. Yet even though he knows he gives the most warm goodbye because in the life he lived he was great friends with the protagonist. The protagonist hadnt spend too much time with this guy that seemed nice yet. Because this Neil is from the future. The protagonist is yet to have this life.\n\nThe protagonist gets hits with 2 emotions at once:\n1. He finds out Neil and himself will become bestest of friends in the future. And he realises that Neil already knew him very well all along\n\n2. He also finds out that this Neil guy sacrifices himself to save him. \n\nThe situation now is that the protagonist will meet a younger version of Neil later in his life. This version of Neil doesnt known the protagonist yet. The protagonist knows they will become best friends and knows that Neil will ultimatly sacrifice himself for the protagonist. Yet he cant stop it.\n\nHe cant stop it. :(  \n\nThe tears the protagonist has are very meaningfull. \n\nA lot of people mis this storypoint on first viewing because no one knows what going on yet. A lot of people completely mis that Neil dies because they think that because we see him after the battle he survived. \n\nKnowing what is happening suddenly makes this scene extremely emotional. \n\nPeople who say this movie lack emotion honeslty just didnt get what was happening. Its an extrmely emotional movie at its core.\n\nOnce you scrutinize the movie you find that it makes sense with the rules it sets up for itself. \n\nAlso fun fact. The movie, just like its name is a palindrome. If you put all the events in a timeline youll find that the 2 halfs line up in time and the red room blue room scene (the one where they flip the timeline by inverting) is in the middle of the movie/palindrome.\n\nThe start and the end take place around the same time in this film.\n\nAgain this movie is full of suprises, you just have to be commited and take your time to find them.\n\nI respect a film that doesnt treat its audience as idiots.\n\nHopefully you can understand my view now :)\nLet me know what your thought are :)",

For smaller scale experiment with palindrome film you should check out Michel Gondry's music video for Sugar Water. It's a split screen with the same footage playing in opposite directions and it's all one shot! Also Dr Who during the 00's explored the emotions of time travel and love in a cool way.",

I don't believe anybody's missing some deeper layer or theme, or some unusual perspective that makes everything fit into place. It's not deconstructing a genre or satirizing itself.\n\nIt's a high concept action film. It's exactly what you expected when you sat down to watch it.",

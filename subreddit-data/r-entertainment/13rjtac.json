I would love to see a movie about sky net where sky net ai sucks and a bunch of tech bros try and tell that 10 fingers on one had is normal.",

One of the most basic rules of the franchise depends on John Conner living. And James Cameron signed off on it. !&lt; \n\nThe story could be about any other survivor group anywhere on the planet. Go back to a lower budget and away from the central characters.",

John conner wouldn't exist if skynet didn't send a T800 into the past. Skynet wouldn't have been born if the T800 didn't go into the past.\n\nKilling John conner killed skynet as well because one couldn't exist without another.",

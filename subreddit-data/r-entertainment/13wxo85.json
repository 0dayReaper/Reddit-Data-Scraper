            "comment": "&gt; In a post-COVID plot twist, Howard gets news from head office that her branch will be shutting down and that staff will have to work from home. She goes into survival mode, making promises she can\u2019t keep and launches outlandish plots in order to keep her \u201cwork family\u201d together.\n\nTwo thoughts. \n\n1) I hope this is a critique on anti remote working bosses. That would be good.\n\n2) I hope its not just gender swapping. The jokes won\u2019t land if you just rehash David Brent because him being an insecure man is integral to the plot. Hopefully they go the Leslie Knope route and actually create a woman character.",

            "comment": "Melissa McCarthy\u00a0was definitely on edge when she knew she\u2019d be working with the actor behind Anton Chigurh, Bond villain Raoul Silva and many other intimidating characters, but\u00a0Javier Bardem\u00a0quickly disarmed her during their one day of shooting together on\u00a0The Little Mermaid. McCarthy and Bardem play rival siblings Ursula and King Triton in\u00a0Rob Marshall and John DeLuca\u2019s live-action reimagining of the 1989 animated classic, and once her anxiety quickly dissipated, McCarthy made a point to enjoy every second that she shared with Bardem.\n\n\u201cI was really nervous to meet him, but the nerves went away within two seconds. The second you meet Javier, he\u2019s like a walking warm hug,\u201d McCarthy tells\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI always find it fascinating how people throw their energy so differently per their characters. When his energy is on, it\u2019s what you would expect from being in a room with Javier [in character]. You feel it.\u201d\n\nBardem\u2019s body of work consists of mostly grown-up fare, including some of the most terrifying baddies that have ever been brought to the screen, so he definitely wanted to make something that his two young kids could enjoy. The film has also helped prepare him for the inevitable day when he has to let his children leave the nest, something King Triton struggles to do with Ariel (Halle Bailey).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the fear and the insecurity that one feels as a father in order to understand and accept the fact that your kids are going to fly free sooner or later,\u201d Bardem says. \u201cAnd, as a father, I related to that. In Rob [Marshall] and John\u2019s [DeLuca] version, they have strengthened that side of the story.\u2026 It\u2019s more reliable and more emotional than the original\u2026with all the respect and love for the original, of course.\u201d\n\nBelow, during a recent conversation with\u00a0THR, McCarthy and Bardem also discuss how Marshall and DeLuca\u2019s backgrounds in dance and choreography made their filming experiences even more unique. Bardem then makes the case for an Ursula and Triton spinoff.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s brought everything that you can ask for and imagine. So I need an Ursula spinoff, and since our characters are siblings, I want to have one scene with her while having dinner.\u201d",

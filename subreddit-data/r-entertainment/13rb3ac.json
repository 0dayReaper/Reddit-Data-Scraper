Was being revived in Toronto, Bjorn and his family (I believe another member of ABBA?) stayed at my hotel. \n\nI had NO idea who ABBA was other than Dancing Queen. \n\nHe came to the desk needing a room key. \n\nI asked for ID. \n\nHe laughed, they laughed\u2026. I started to chuckle looking back and forth at them. \u201cHa, Ha,\u2026. ?\u201d\n\nHe pulled out a packet of press clippings and shuffled them on the counter, all of them about him. \n\nI picked up one put it down and said \u201cThis is all really cool stuff, congratulations! I still need a valid form of ID\u201d. \n\nHe produced his passport. \n\nIt was an interesting experience circa 1999.",

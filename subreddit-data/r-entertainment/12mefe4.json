Read [the whole thing](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a43518988/pedro-pascal-the-last-of-us-interview-2023/), including:\n\n&gt;\tWe are talking during a particularly grim week for trans people, a population that includes Lux, and you are probably reading this during another one. I ask what this moment in time is like for her, and his immediate reply is: \u201cYou mean in terms of the pandemic?\u201d *His eyes tell me he knows that\u2019s not what I mean, and I\u2019m immediately sorry I asked. Can\u2019t Lux just be Lux, have an exciting week, do her graduation show, see her family? Why does she have to dignify every Twitter and CPAC jackass with a response? Can\u2019t everyone who isn\u2019t straight or cisgender just exist, without having to make a statement?* It\u2019s possible I\u2019m projecting all of that onto his answer. But also, maybe not.

On Twitter, the most vile hatred you can imagine is spewed and applauded. I've seen the insult of calling them \"Frankenstein freaks\" go completely unpunished, liked, shared, etc. People say things like ALL trans people are pedophiles.\n\nI've been on Twitter a few months now. I'm still shocked at the amount of pure unbridled hatred that place is overflowing with now, and anyone who uses the platform for even a little bit can see what I'm talking about. For Elon Musk to pretend it doesn't exist is an absolute travesty in the fight against bigotry towards transitioned people. I applaud Pedro Pascal wholeheartedly for his public support of his sister. I applaud ANYONE who defends transitioned people right now when so much hatred is on the rise.\n\nPeople always have to have someone to hate. It's the stupidest aspect of our species.",

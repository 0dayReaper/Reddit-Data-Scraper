Jerry Seinfeld is hilarious and always has been. He\u2019s a decent guy according to everyone who knows him (as in people who know him in real life, not by way of Reddit). He dated a young girl once decades ago and it\u2019s a fun thing to pin on him if you\u2019ve already made up your mind you don\u2019t like him. \n\n\n&gt; The comedian defended his actions by saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize she was so young. This is the only girl I ever went out with who was that young. I wasn\u2019t dating her. We just went to a restaurant, and that was it.\u201d During a People magazine interview, the actor said that the pair clicked because Lonstein was funny and sharp. Seinfeld said, \u201cI am not an idiot. Shoshanna is a person, not an age. She is extremely bright. She\u2019s funny, sharp, very alert. We just get along. You can hear the click.\u201d \n\n&gt; Even Lonstein\u2019s family approved of the relationship. A source close to her family said, \u201cJerry is thoughtful, a good person. The family has nothing but positive feelings about both of them. Everyone respects their relationship.\u201d \n\n[Full Article from Fandom Wire](https://fandomwire.com/she-is-a-person-not-an-age-950m-jerry-seinfeld-had-the-most-insane-reason-for-dating-17-year-old-who-later-became-dazzling-fashion-designer/)",

Gaffigan, I saw in December of last year &amp; I think I paid about the same, but for good seats. I would be willing to bet these will hover around $150. The fact that they're doing an arena tour &amp; not a theater tour means these will probably be not as crazy expensive. I've seen a lot of comedians &amp; I've never had to pay an atrocious amount.\n\nI saw Chapelle on NYE 2021 in Seattle &amp; if I remember correctly, they were only like $140 - those were the most expensive I've ever paid. I saw Mulaney live last summer &amp; that was only $90ish. Bill Burr, Lewis Black, Tig Notaro, and Aziz were all like less than $60 when I saw them.\n\nI will be very surprised if these are a crazy amount of money. The tour will probably be very limited. I'd bet it's more of a handful of shows in like 5 cities (NYC, Chicago, LA, ???)",

He and Larry David literally changed the way the public thinks about everyday monotony. \n\nI agree with the general reddit consensus that he isn't particularly funny anymore in this age where there are a ton of great standups, but he was undoubtedly incredibly influential and one of the best to ever do it.",

It was great in its time, but he hasn't evolved at all as a comedian.",

                    "comment": "Agree to disagree. Seinfeld is one of the best stand up comedians to ever do it.  When he was coming up, his style and material was extremely groundbreaking. Observational, low stakes, social oddities, and clean. His style is the foundation of a ton of modern comedy - tho most modern comics are much darker. Here\u2019s an example: Louis ck has a new joke where he was walking down the street and saw a shop with a wheelchair in the display. And he asks \u201cis that really an impulse purchase?\u201d. Eventually connecting it to the Boston marathon bombing.\n\nThat joke is dark as hell - BUT, also extremely low stake observational stuff. The core of the funny there is still a twist on a social ritual you maybe haven\u2019t considered or put any thought into.\n\nIt\u2019s more that 50 year old comedy routines that nearly everyone has heard, copied, or expanded on get stale. Jerry still scoops you the original flavor, but you\u2019ve had so many kinds of ice cream now, it\u2019s feels unfulfilling. Which is okay.\n\nI will say this for the Jerry of today - he is still one of the funniest acts you can ever see that is nearly entirely clean, not even a cuss word. The best comedians today can go really dark and dirty and enhance their comedy - the bad ones basically rely on the shock of it to get any reaction. \n\nAll of them will admit it\u2019s extremely hard to do clean shows that are still hilarious. With Seinfeld you can count on it.",

He\u2019s also fucking hysterical in everyday life. He\u2019s so far from being an asshole. I get it if you think his material is played out or whatever, but the man is just as wholesome as he appears to be.",

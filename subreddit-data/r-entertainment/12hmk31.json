Loved the show and everything, but the medium of video games vs film really makes a difference and &gt;!killing a whole bunch of random people who are trying to make a cure because *you* are personally attached to the character being sacrificed!&lt; just hits way harder than observing it imo.\n\nPlaying Part 2 made me experience the closest thing to an ego death without the use of drugs. It will be great television, but there's something about being the one enacting the events you experience that I don't think film can quite match.\n\nRDR2 is probably in 3rd place after the two Last of Us games as far as emotional weight from a vidja game for me, but I can't imagine it being much more than an extremely well done western if it was a movie or show.",

Playing it out in the game does give you a sense of responsibility in a way, but there's something \"real\" about seeing it happen in live action. It adds weight to see \"real\" people make the decisions you saw an animated character make.\n\nTo me, it's like watching animated vs live action horror. You know the animation is just that, it isn't real. Live action makes it \"real.\"",

It's all in the story and characters. The show, because if it's visuals, actors and directing brings together the essence of TLOU with much more impact. I'd rather rewatch the show than replay the game.",

I just recently played TLOU on PS4 and I loved the story, but the gameplay itself was meh. I know the game came out about a decade ago but it felt so dated. If it wasn't for the story being so good there wouldn't really be much that sets it apart from your standard third person shooter. I enjoyed the game but idk if I'll ever play it again. excited to play tlou 2 when it goes on sale for $10 again though.",

This shows me that every aspect of the game has been designed carefully. \n\nBut the story is indeed the core and it is brilliant. I am a fan.",

I think it would be hard to stay true to the story/Arthur because so much of what we know about him comes from his journal. It\u2019s like adapting a Steven King book, with some exceptions. The Shining book vs. the movie are very different due to the internal monologues of the characters being presented in the book but not the movie. Without that piece of information, it\u2019s a very different story. That and there\u2019s the 4 different endings as well, depending on how you play the game. It\u2019s different when you have a linear story with only one ending.",

The characters and locations have enough depth and uniqueness that you don't have to adapt the game missions 1:1. You can use the same thematic and character material in episodic stories that are more suited to the screen. E.g. on the screen not everything has to be initiated by Arthur. And of course you don't need tutorial content: hunting with Hosea can be really about the relationship with each other and nature, insight into the gang's history and inner conflicts.\n\nThere are a thousand amazing screen-ready ways to introduce Micah and learn what a psycho he is, or to build the gang's familial relationship, or to piss off an oil tycoon, or to get chased out of town. Do those things in a Valentine and prairie cowboy visual style and you've got Chapter two.",

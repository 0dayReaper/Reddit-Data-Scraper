            "comment": "Searchlight\u00a0has today debuted the first full-length trailer for its new film\u00a0Poor Things, marking the second collaboration between Emma Stone and filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos on the heels of his 2018 Oscar winner\u00a0The Favourite.\n\nBased on Alasdair Gray\u2019s 1992 novel of the same name,\u00a0Poor Things\u00a0follows Bella Baxter (Stone), a young woman brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe). Under Baxter\u2019s protection, Bella is eager to learn.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an experiment. Her brain and her body are not quite synchronized,\u201d says a nearly unrecognizable Dafoe, with a face transformed by prosthetics, in the trailer. \u201cBut she is progressing at an accelerated pace.\u201d\n\nHungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, she grows steadfast in her purpose to stand for equality and liberation.\n\n\u201cTell me, where did she come from?\u201d wonders Ramy Youssef\u2019s Max McCandless \u2014 to which Dafoe\u2019s Dr. Baxter replies, \u201cI shall, for it is a happy tale.\u201d\n\nThe film hitting theaters on September 8th.",

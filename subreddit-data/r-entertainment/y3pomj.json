It must be very hard to be a man of a certain age, who\u2019s been allowed to say what he wants for years, and now suddenly there\u2019s some accountability. It\u2019s free speech, but it\u2019s not consequence-free.\u201d\n\n&gt;Norton didn\u2019t mention Rowling by name, but said that, rather than getting the opinion of celebrities, such as himself, on matters like transgender rights \u2014 something that \u201cadds nothing to the discussion\u201d \u2014 people should instead \u201ctalk to trans people, talk the parents of trans kids, talk to doctors, talk to psychiatrists, to someone who can illuminate this in some way. I\u2019m very aware that, as bloke of the telly, your voice can be artificially amplified, and once in a blue moon, that can be good, but most of the time, it\u2019s just a distraction. It\u2019s for clicks.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201dIf you want to talk about something, talk about the thing, you don\u2019t need to attach a Kardashian or whatever to a subject, the subject should be enough in itself.\u201d",

Too often people think that just because someone is listening, they have to speak. Unless you\u2019re directing their attention towards someone who is actually informed about and impacted by the topic at hand.. it\u2019s honestly sometimes just better to play the shut the fuck up game.",

I can't think of any scandal, and a quick Google search to cover my ass brings up nothing either. \n\nEvery celebrity I've seen on his show seems to genuinely enjoy him, his company, his format, and his other guests. And he has so many repeat guests, who all, again, seem to genuinely love him.",

Also I think having every guest there on the couch together really lends itself to everyone being looser and more likely to genuinely talk and share.  The interactions are often the best part.  And he's a great interviewer in that he gets people to share things they might not otherwise do.  It's a great format.  i'd read that James corden wanted that same format for his show and the studio was very concerned.  however the problem with that show is he's not Graham.  There's something about GN that's just delightful.",

I believe we do have good hosts here but they are held back by their format. I also love how GN has all the guests on at once. He does a fantastic job bouncing back and forth between them.",

Assumptions should not be made.\n\nHowever, sometimes I really do wonder if JK Rowling would identify as a trans man if she were born today. Some of her recounts of her experiences with womanhood as a child echo so closely with AFAB trans folks. Sometimes I wonder if because her experiences of trauma and suffering are so closely tied to womanhood, that she cannot separate them and that\u2019s why she cannot conceive why some people may cast off womanhood.\n\nObviously I\u2019m not claiming Rowling is a trans man. Whatever she chooses to identify as I will acknowledge and respect because that\u2019s just what decent folk ought to do. The only thing she doesn\u2019t get a choose is the label of TERF, which she 100% is. I just wonder sometimes\u2026 Especially since she really just has no dog in this fight but is so adamant about being in it and causing as much harm as possible.\n\nThe things she says and does just feel too personal to me.",

They took a short break, and came back with an album that contained their most successful single of their careers (#4 on Billboard, 6 spots higher than their highest single pre-Bush comments) and they won the Grammy for Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Country Performance by a Duo/Group.  This is all while Bush was still in office.  Since Bush left they've been selling out stadiums and achieved the titles of the best selling all-woman band *and* the best selling country group of all time.\n\nHere's the timeline for the Chicks:  \n\n1989-1997: minimal success pre-Maines\n\n1997-2003: sign Maines and achieve massive success\n\n2003-2006: hit in popularity, taken off a lot of radio stations but still selling records like crazy.  still quite successful/popular in Europe (the fans at the show where they made the comments about Bush cheered their asses off, one American news organization edited the clips to fade out the audience and make it sound like they didn't support Maines and that's the clip other American news organizations ran with)\n\n2007-2022: 5 Grammys in 5 nominations, more social commentary proven correct (supported the West Memphis Three), more critical acclaim than pre-comments, more records sold than pre-comments, 12 straight years of sold out touring since 2010\n\nThey're better off now than they ever were when Dixie was still in their name.  They had a brief hiccup that encompassed 10% of their time as a band, their careers didn't end.  \n\nI highly recommend the Cancel Culture episode of the You're Wrong About podcast.  The idea that people get permanently cancelled is pure fantasy, outside of a few (generally convicted) exceptions like your Weinsteins and Brock Turners.",

He did the right thing by resigning.\n\n[https://abcnews.go.com/US/sen-al-frankens-accusers-accusations-made/story?id=51406862](https://abcnews.go.com/US/sen-al-frankens-accusers-accusations-made/story?id=51406862)\n\nEDIT - Since OP blocked me I am unable to respond to the plethora of comments I've received so I will just say here that that NYer article only addresses the one claim and provides the context to the photo that everyone already knows, it doesn't even pretend to address the other claims.  And for everyone claiming they \"came to nothing\" or \"disappeared\" - what did you expect to happen?  None of these women were claiming anything that would result in criminal charges, just that he was gropey.  Do you have any idea how common that is?  That doesn't mean you get the cops involved, it just means someone is gropey.  The claims didn't \"go away\", they are still there, no one has rescinded anything.  Franken resigned, there was no reason to continue investigating.  Some things are not criminal and are still not okay.\n\nFinally, in politics, no one can \"force\" you to resign but the voters.  He is perfectly free to run again if he wants to as well.",

There's been lots of times I've considered quitting the online spaces altogether or the scene for these reasons, but in the end I love my genuine connections with the friends around too much to abandon them. Just have to treat your entire platform as a company CEO sadly, lock down and only post PR friendly content, say absolutely nothing in public. Many of my friends also have resorted to doing the same.",

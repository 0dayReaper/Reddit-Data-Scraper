I\u2019d choose days not to eat, or carefully count calories every day leading up to the weekend so I could have x number of alcoholic drinks, only y type so they\u2019d be lower calorie, then back on the scale as soon as I got home to make sure I\u2019d be able to fast (aka: starve) enough to make the next call. My manager would get in with my partner and roommate to try to make sure I was in line and doing what I \u201cneeded to\u201d in order to make call and make money. \n\nLong and the short - I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s right, because she is most certainly the poster child for \u201cwhat is wrong with celebs?\u201d, but it\u2019s entirely possible that she\u2019s been so ensconced with this bullshit that she thinks this is how normal people think.

Then the whole Mario thing is just baffling and legit seems he just is mad he wasn\u2019t casted.",

I basically said, \"That guy's an idiot, he's definitely not Mexican and doesn't know anything about Mexican history.  You'll get better history just picking up the phone and talking to your abuelita.\"",

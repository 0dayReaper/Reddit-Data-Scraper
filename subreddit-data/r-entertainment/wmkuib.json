Smallville did the same thing when they got Annette O'Toole to replace Cynthia Ettinger after the pilot had been shot.\n\nThe one problem I see with reshooting Flash is that there are probably a ton of heavily CG'd scenes with the Flash, and those would all need to be redone.  It could be a huge chunk of the original budget.",

Justice League bombing. Suicide Squad being a pile of crap. Ben Affleck leaving, then kind of coming back, then kind of leaving again. The whole Amber Heard mess (is she actually even in the movie anymore?). Ezra Miller just travelling the country assaulting random people. Entirely filmed movies being cancelled. All these announced projects having been in the pre-development phase for like 4-5 years now. \n\nAt this point just keep Gal and Margot (and Jason too I suppose), and New 52 the whole thing and start over.",

It felt like a really, really high-budget BBC production more so than a Disney movie. Not a negative, but not really what was expected.\n\nThen I saw Aladdin. The problem is that Aladdin's really only a memorable movie for Robin Williams; imagine Will Smith's live-action genie acting that way. You don't get Disney magic; you get The Mask with Jim Carrey. But having Genie-Smith be basically him, but blue, just kind of dulls the film into something unremarkable and easily forgotten.\n\nIt wasn't really the fables and faerie tales that drew people into Disney and cemented its place as one of the preeminent animation studios in the world. It was the magic they wove into those stories, and they seem to have forgotten that.",

Thats not seemingly an outlier from other Disney live action adaptations.\n\nDumbo opened at $45m and ended at $115m for a 2.55X multiplier.\n\nThe Lion King opened to $191m and hit $543m domestic for a 2.84x multiplier.\n\nBeauty and the Beast opened to $174m and ended up at $504m for a 2.89X multiplier.\n\nAlladin opened to $91m and ended up at $356m fror a massive 3.91x Multiplier. Alladin had incredible legs. Its fall weekend 2-3 was only 42%, from there it was incredibly low for the next several weeks not breaking 35% once, until weekend 12.\n\nIts possible this movie has Alladin type legs, but we really just don't know yet. The picture will clear up this weekend. If it manages a 35%-45% drop then its possible that something really remarkable could be in store for it, but if it takes a real hit then cresting just over $300m is a real possibility. \n\nNone of this speaks to the quality of the movie, which I'm sure is great, or the credibility of bounding into comics, which is garbage as are they. Just that we don't really know where this movie is going to end up yet and after its start $300m is not a bad number.",

It is currently very domestically heavy, about 57% Domestic, and if that stays steady it will hit about $600M. However, its legs are improving in Latin America and Europe relative to the US (likely due to a low european opening but decent word of mouth, it got a A cinemascore). Plus it hasnt opened in Japan, and while it isnt likely to do gangbusters it japan that could easily be another 10M-30M on top of that. In the end this will probably end up close to a 50/50 split and around $640M WW\n\nA disappointment in the international market since these historically did almost 70% internationally, but hardly the failure most people are saying",

The old Disney movies were always careful to get the \"I want\" songs right, and by not making Halle's \"I want song\" an emotional experience you just don't feel the same investment in her character as in the originals.",

My oldest daughter said it\u2019s because it\u2019s too \u201cflat and old looking\u201d.   \n\nIn the theater I was surprised there was no children beside mine. It was a lot of adult Black women. \n\nI\u2019m mixed, Black/Asian. I enjoyed it for the most part. I liked the slight expansion of the story line to make it all fit together. \n\nMy 5 year was engaged in the beginning, lost interest during the courting, but the Shuttle Butt song pulled her back in. \n\nShe came home and wanted to see the cartoon version or what she calls the \u201creal one\u201d because it\u2019s the original. She  lost interest pretty quick. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s dark and dreary no more than the original. Heck going back I was shocked Ursula calls her a \u201clittle tramp\u201d in the cartoon because my 5 year old picked it that real quick.\n\nThe live action for the most part stayed to the script of the original. \n\nI think Disney needed to modernize The Little Mermaid with better graphics. Was the live action necessary? No. However I am glad they did take the risk. \n\nComing from a time as a little girl where seeing Black characters much less toy dolls representation - this was a sense of \u201cfinally\u201d kind of feeling. My real life mermaid as a kid was Darryl Hannah. Omg I would have loved to see an Asian or Black woman as a \u201clive action\u201d.    At age 45 I finally got to see it. Which is pretty cool- esp when my daughter can say \u201cmommy there\u2019s a mermaid like Grandma when she was young\u201d (referring to Asian) and also seeing one like herself.  \n\nI hope people give it a chance and watch it rather than shut it down.",

They didn\u2019t slow down because of the live-action versions. These remakes are not being made instead of animated movies. Live-action and animation co-exist at Disney since basically forever.\n\nSo I don\u2019t see the point of saying \"go back to animation\" as if they gave it up so they could focus of live-action remakes, when they absolutely did not. It\u2019s just that there is a new trend of remakes among the live-action movies. But it doesn\u2019t have any impact on the animated movies.

It\u2019s spread like some \u201cgotcha\u201d comment by internet people and it\u2019s not based in any reality. \n\nHollywood today, right now, currently, is sitting on a treasure trove of great idea. On every desk and computer in every studio are brilliant scripts \u2014 ideas. Lower level people within the walls talk about these scripts. They\u2019re Black List winners, context winner, bold concepts from young writers and passion projects from big name directors. \n\nWe\u2019re talking about epic war dramas, period pieces, romantic comedies, buddy comedies, queer love stories, dark thrillers \u2014 practically every brilliant concept imagined under the sun. \n\nEnd of the day, Hollywood is a business. Their raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to make money and job security. And job security is tied to making money. If you produce a film that bombs, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re getting axed. Or you\u2019re going to have a helluva hard time making another one. \n\nPeople don\u2019t go to movies anymore. They\u2019re not the cultural phenomena that they used to be. At least not in scale, and definitely not for the \u201cgood ones.\u201d \n\nLook at the list of last year\u2019s academy nominees for best picture. Everything Everywhere, Banshees, T\u00e1r, etc. Few broke $100 million box office. Many didn\u2019t break $50 million. \n\nAnd despite being smaller productions, movies never cost more to make. So ROI is slim. \n\nHollywood isn\u2019t out of ideas. With increased free time and global artists and ubiquitous technology, there are more people writing \u201cgood ideas\u201d than ever. \n\nBut Hollywood sticks to remakes, sequels, and existing IP (video games and books and such) because it\u2019s guaranteed box office. Guaran-fucking-teed. \n\nIf Banshees of Inisherin made $300 million dollars, you\u2019d see a never ending deluge of facsimiles trying to capitalize on that good, original idea. But Banshees didn\u2019t make a lot of money. Avatar did. Disney live actions did. Marvel did. \n\nAnd Hollywood, despite being famous for movies, is still behind TV production. Television series have never been better. From Mad Men and Sopranos of yesteryear, to The Bear and Succession of today. That\u2019s Hollywood. Behind good ideas. \n\nThe difference is that they are going where people are: on their couch. \n\nWhy risk an indie crime thriller or bloated-budget war piece about something obscure about the Siege of Malta when you can just churn out remakes and existing IP to guarantee box office, and simultaneously create prestige television to capture audiences in their homes? \n\nThis is rant worthy. And I apologize. But the idea that Hollywood is out of ideas is false. They have access to unknown writers everywhere from Newark to Buenos Aires. They have thousands of brilliant scripts collecting dust in their offices. They have access to signed and established directors/writers/actors who have their own brilliant scripts that they\u2019ve been working on for years. There are more accessible ideas than ever. \n\nBut, to beat a dead horse, you don\u2019t go to theaters. Not YOU. Maybe YOU do. But people don\u2019t. At least not for the \u201cgood ideas.\u201d But they sure as shit will go when Thor or a video game character is on screen. \n\nThat\u2019s why there are fewer good movies made from good ideas. People don\u2019t go see them, thus they don\u2019t make money, thus they don\u2019t have a large ROI even when they do have moderate success, they they don\u2019t get made. \n\nHollywood is risk averse. Not because they\u2019re out of ideas. But because missing on a \u201cgood idea\u201d financially could sink a company or sink a career.",

                            "comment": "This is the correct answer. Hollywood isn't out of ideas. Hollywood can't reliably *sell* ideas. Not on the big screen, anyway. The reason why Hollywood sells big, loud and dumb as a bag of hammers is because there is a large component of the audience that does not care how dumb the script is so long as it's big and loud. Also, the foreign box office is more and more important, and \"smart\" is, quite literally, more difficult to translate. Also, the people who do want smart scripts don't go to movie theaters. They stay home and watch HBO.\n\nThis isn't hyperbole, or some kind of smart-aleck statement about moviemaking. No, HBO has deliberately cultivated an audience that likes its scripts engaging and complex. They've taken on loss leaders like *The Wire*, which was never watched particularly heavily, just to establish their brand. When shows like *Game of Thrones* start looking really loud and stupid, their showrunners get shitcanned. By contrast, *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen* was known in advance to have no script, was known in advance to be directed by a guy who did not know, nor care, what story he told, and was specifically advertised on the basis of how many hard drives they melted to render the CGI. Everyone knew that this would be two-and-a-half hours of your brain being reduced to tapioca as Michael Bay's unvarnished id splooged itself across the screen.\n\nAnd *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen* still made $400m domestic, and over $800m once you counted the overseas box office, rentals and video sales. Hollywood sells what people want to buy. And as much as people keep saying that they'd like to see big, bold, smartly written stuff on the big screen, our behavior says we are perfectly willing to watch robots appropriate cultures that don't even exist, so long as they also smash each other up in big and loud ways.",

I wasn\u2019t super overly impressed with everything, and it felt the tiniest bit long, and some of the cgi is wonky sometimes or merpeople just look kinda awkward as fuck while halfway out of the water, but those were small things and I ignored them and enjoyed the movie. I wish it wasn\u2019t this politicized because I\u2019d honestly consider seeing it a second time.\n\nI will say though that it\u2019s absolutely not a kids movie/kid friendly length. It\u2019s meant for millennials that wanted something a bit more tangible than the original animated film.",

Some movies start off strong on reputation or franchise alone, but, once enough people cycle through and share their opinion(s) movies either pick up in interest or they lag.",

While kids today will grow up loving them as a part of their childhood. Let\u2019s be honest, most kids that are the target audience don\u2019t use Reddit or Facebook. They won\u2019t realize the importance or lack of it of these movies until they grow up.",

The International opening was weak, but legs are looking decent in every market except China and Korea. \n\nThe movie is performing in a way that is, at worst, average domestically and a little disappointing internationally. it will end up somewhere around $600M World wide, which would have been an outright success had it not been for the added costs of reshooting with COVID restrictions",

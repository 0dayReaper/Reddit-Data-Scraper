At what point does personal responsibility become a factor in this equation? I see piss comin' I run. She saw piss comin' she stayed. And why should I miss out on the next R. Kelly album *just* fo' that?\"",

Hankerson introduced her to R. Kelly, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing but a Number. \n\n&gt; With the release of Age Ain't Nothing but a Number, rumors circulated of a relationship between Aaliyah and R. Kelly,[15][113] including the allegation that they had secretly married without her parents' knowledge.[114][115] Vibe magazine later revealed a marriage certificate that listed the couple married on August 31, 1994, in Sheraton Gateway Suites in Rosemont, Illinois.[115] Aaliyah, who was 15 at the time, was listed as 18 on the certificate; R. Kelly was 27. \n\n&gt; In his 2011 book The Man Behind the Man: Looking From the Inside Out, Demetrius Smith Sr., Kelly's former tour manager, revealed that Kelly married Aaliyah after she told him that she was pregnant.[119] In the 2019 documentary Surviving R. Kelly, Smith described how he helped Aaliyah forge the necessary documents to show she was 18 in order to marry Kelly.[120] Smith also stated that he is \"not proud\" of his role in facilitating their marriage.[121] Additionally, the documentary revealed that Jovante Cunningham, a former backup dancer, claimed to have witnessed Kelly having sex with Aaliyah on his tour bus.[122]\n\n&gt; Aaliyah admitted in court documents that she had lied about her age. In May 1997, she filed suit in Cook County seeking to have all records of the marriage expunged because she was not old enough under state law to get married without her parents' consent. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaliyah\n\nR. Kelly has been raping people for 30 years.",

He was the Oprah before Oprah . That's when we were finally allowed to talk about child sexual abuse. Before that, everyone had said just keep it as quiet as possible. It was really important for the children to be acknowledged as not being sexual objects and that's progressed so much now. It is completely different in today's world when it comes to sexual abuse of children and I think it's wonderful. The very fact that there are people commenting that 15-year-old girl should not be on sexual videos is amazing progress.",

The sentencing limits were extended in the early 2000s after Maxwell committed their last convicted crime so the judge sentenced them to the recommended amount at the time it took place. The judge even said if their is a conviction for an incident that occurred after the sentencing guidelines were increased they would follow the new ones. R Kelly was convicted of more recent crimes so he got more recent sentencing guidelines.\n\nEdit: spelling and grammar",

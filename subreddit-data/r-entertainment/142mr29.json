            "comment": "&gt; **Getting fired from \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d was a public humiliation for a filmmaker who had racked up hit after hit. But a series of personal scandals would dwarf that professional setback.** Over the ensuing five and a half years, Singer tried to reenter the fray with an $80 million remake of \u201980s action film \u201cRed Sonja\u201d for Millennium Films. **Then a 2019 Atlantic expos\u00e9 that detailed allegations that Singer sexually assaulted four men when they were underage derailed those plans. (Singer categorically denied ever having sex with, or a preference for, underage men.)**\n\n&gt; **Millennium CEO Avi Lerner initially stood by Singer, dubbing the report \u201cagenda-driven fake news,\u201d but dropped him when he couldn\u2019t find a domestic distributor.** Though the once in-demand helmer made studios billions thanks to four \u201cX-Men\u201d movies and \u201cSuperman Returns,\u201d **he had become persona non grata in the post-#MeToo landscape.**\n\n\n&gt; Now, Singer is quietly plotting a comeback and has been pitching industryites on a slate of films. \n\n&gt; **Sources say the director**, who catapulted to A-list status with his twisty 1995 crime film \u201cThe Usual Suspects,\u201d **is looking to return to his lower-budget auteur roots with three narrative features set in and around Israel, where he has been living in recent years.** Singer, who is working without an agent, has been meeting with would-be investors about backing the films, one of which is set in the 1970s. **They would be made for $10 million apiece. Jason Taylor, who previously served as president of production at Singer\u2019s Bad Hat Harry Prods., is producing the films.**",

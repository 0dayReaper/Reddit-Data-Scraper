Rupert Friend describes some production details of the adaptation:^1\n\n&gt;It could change, but when we made it, there were four stories drawn from a Roald Dahl [short story collection], which are his slightly darker, twisted ones that he wrote for adults. Wes took four of them and put together a smaller troupe of actors: myself, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dev Patel, and Richard Ayoade. We each play in around two of the stories and kind of change roles. I think Ralph might be in all of them. My two are \u201cThe Ratcatcher\u201d and \u201cThe Swan.\u201d\n\n^1 https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2023/5/yfchn6nt9yt53gt5s9sts9pgpsujfe",

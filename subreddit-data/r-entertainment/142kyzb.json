            "comment": "Filmmaker\u00a0Zack Snyder\u00a0has affirmed online speculation surrounding his forthcoming\u00a0Netflix\u00a0space opera\u00a0Rebel Moon, confirming that it will be split into two films, with multiple cuts to be released of each installment.\n\nSnyder\u2019s comments came as part of an\u00a0interview with Vanity Fair, also featuring his producing partner and wife, Deborah Snyder. In it, Deborah explains that the decision to expand\u00a0Rebel Moon\u00a0into a two-parter emerged from a dialogue with higher-ups at Netflix, including Film chairman Scott Stuber. \u201cOriginally, the script was one movie, but it was in \u2018Zack form,'\u201d she says. \u201cIt was 172 pages.\u201d\n\nIn coming to understand that the film would come in at around a three-hour runtime, she explains, \u201cStuber was like, \u2018On the service, under-two-hour movies really do better for some reason,\u2019 even though you\u2019ll binge-watch a series of eight episodes.\n\n\u201cZack said, \u2018If you ask me to make this less than two hours, I\u2019m going to lose all the character. You won\u2019t care about these people. It\u2019s a character story about how people can change, and redemption, and what are you willing to fight for\u2026'\u201d continued Deborah Snyder. \u201cSo [Stuber] said, \u2018What if I give you two movies?'\u201d\n\nWhile the first chapter of\u00a0Rebel Moon\u00a0will arrive on Netflix on December 22, a release date for the second hasn\u2019t been set. Still, said Zack Snyder, \u201cIt won\u2019t be long after. Netflix can do things that a traditional studio can\u2019t do as far as how close together the movies are released.\u201d\n\nAs to the multiple cuts of the\u00a0Rebel Moon\u00a0films, he explained that the first will be one \u201cthat anyone can enjoy and watch,\u201d with the second for each installment to be more adult-oriented. \u201cI think for fans of mine and people who are ready to take a deeper, harder dive, that\u2019ll be fun for them,\u201d he said.\n\nA sci-fi adventure film that Snyder has been mulling since college,\u00a0Rebel Moon\u00a0is set in a peaceful colony on the edge of the galaxy that finds itself threatened by the armies of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius, then dispatching a young woman (Sofia Boutella) with a mysterious past to seek out warriors from neighboring planets to help them make a stand.\n\nPic\u2019s the first to fall under Netflix\u2019s first-look partnership with\u00a0the Snyders and Wesley Coller\u2019s The Stone Quarry Productions. Also starring are Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou, Anthony Hopkins, Doona Bae, Ray Fisher, Stuart Martin,\u00a0Cary Elwes,\u00a0Corey Stoll,\u00a0Michiel Huisman, Alfonso Herrera, Ed Skrein, Cleopatra Coleman, Fra Fee, Rhian Rees, Jena Malone, E. Duffy, Charlotte Maggi, Sky Yang and Staz Nair.\n\nSnyder wrote the script, based on his and Kurt Johnstad\u2019s story, with Shay Hatten and Johnstad. Producers include the Snyders and Coller for The Stone Quarry, as well as Eric Newman for Grand Electric. Bergen Swanson is exec producing alongside Hatten, Johnstad, and Sarah Bowen for Grand Electric.",

I know some are AMAZING and some aren't great.  But I also know what to expect generally, and temper my expectations so I can mostly  enjoy almost anywhere.  \n\nI don't go to McDonalds expecting anything great, so I'm never going to walk out saying \"that wasn't a five star gourmet experience, I'm disappointed!\" I'm going to walk out thinking \"I expected a big mac, and enjoyed a big mac.\"",

It might very well be worse than the theatrical/extended cuts we have. We only know that the cast of the film have petitioned for its release.",

The conflicts over Legend, Blade Runner, and Kingdom of Heaven are well documented. But he's kind of his own worst enemy, as evidenced by the absurd production cycle of Robin Hood.\n\nStudio people aren't the devil. Their job is to try to produce a commercially successful film. The theatrical cut of Kingdom of Heaven was the \"commercial\" product, while the director's cut, approved by the studio remember, was the artistic triumph.\n\nThe studio executives who produced the theatrical cut of Blade Runner were not stupid people. They just saw major issues with the film (arguably valid issues) and sought to paper them over with narration and an altered ending.\n\nEnd of the day, there has never been a Zack Snyder film where the theatrical cut was more highly regarded than the director's cut. There's never been a Donnie Darko situation it felt like his director's cut ruined what made the theatrical cut so special.\n\nWhether his sensibilities are wise commercially is a whole other matter. Artistically, they seem spot-on. HOWEVER, because we haven't seen the director's cut of Sucker Punch, we really don't know whether the studio made the right call reworking the film. We can speculate based on his track record that it was better, but we don't know this for sure.\n\nReminds me of Kenneth Branagh and Artemis Fowl. He shot a movie, it tested terribly, so it was EXTENSIVELY reshoot into a terrible movie. But was the original cut good or bad? Were the test audiences wrong? Was Disney wrong? We'll probably never know.",

These people stormed the capitol thinking they were American Bolsheviks  poised to decapitate the bald eagle &amp; wrest control of the government in a coup d'etat, not realizing thats not how the government is structured. You can't just take a building hostage and be legitimated. \n\nBut what's more, they got in there and were immediately awed by the majesty of the classical architecture and history of the building so much so that they sort of calmed down LOL. They changed their minds. \n\nThey didnt think they'd get that far. If they *had* found Nancy Pelosi and bludgeoned her to death, they would've learned to usurp in an represenative democracy, you have to kill the voters not the politicians. And also, martyring someone in that context creates a lot of public sympathy and generally only strengthens their ideological positions.",

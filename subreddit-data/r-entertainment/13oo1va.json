I care a lot more than most people understand, but my actions do not reflect it. I\u2019ve found that art, which I\u2019ve been passionate about my whole life, does though. If I want to say thank you for something, or express that even though I haven\u2019t seen someone for a long time / reached out to them I still care, I give portraits away as gifts. Usually I try to also integrate something about that person into it as well, like what I see in them. I think the imperfections are what make them so valuable, as you can clearly see that it was handmade regardless of quality. You could easily buy someone something that comes out of a machine and is flawless, or you could give them something that was handmade from just materials with a little indicator to say so lol.",

They had virtually no relation to each other -- different departments, different executives, different creatives. It just so happened that HBO Max replaced the HBO Go/Now apps and was the streaming service that carried HBO shows, but everything behind the scenes was different. That there were \"HBO Max Originals\" completely separate from the traditional \"HBO Originals\" is also wild.\n\nMax is a pretty terrible name for a streamer, but it's probably better than continuing to devalue WB's single biggest name brand by slapping it on a half-baked streaming service with no actual connection to the legitimate HBO.",

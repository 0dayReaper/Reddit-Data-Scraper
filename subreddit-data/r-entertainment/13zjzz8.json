Comic books tend to have cliff hangers from one part to the next and the to be continued can really be drawn in there (pun intended).

I thought it was going to end about 15-20 min sooner and I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t because it allowed Gwen\u2019s character arc from the first couple scenes to play out and her to make that choice.

We want originals, we want more animation, we want visual appeal (which i mention only in regards to how they fucking massacred the animals from the OG), and we want creativity. The same story just realistic isn\u2019t half as entertaining as a movie with multiple art styles, packed with tons of easter eggs, and absolutely dripping in fanservice. I think the last point is a really big factor. Everyone has seen the Little Mermaid for the most part. They\u2019re pulling no one new in, only relying on existing fans. Across the Spiderverse and Into the Spiderverse pull from many different groups of fans. They are based in the idea of \u201cwhat if these characters that you like were to meet?\u201d and that\u2019s an interesting concept to people. They unabashedly (which is fair) are made by and for spider-man comic fanatics, especially niche ones. The niche comic fans who find out about this are drawn in because it\u2019s probably some of the only references to their faves in mass media, and they flock to see it. The more general fans probably just like seeing the comics animated or like being exposed to new stuff. The general masses are brought in with the sagas new interpretation of comic adaptation, as well as a generally entertaining concept, and of course desire to see what all the fanatics are hyped about. So yeah, very different demographics, at the least",

If every movie has the biggest box office does any? Does it truly matter in the long run that the buzzword headline gets pushed to us? Is there anyone on the fence that's going to see a movie based on how much money it's raked in the first day? I get it's supposed to show \"everyone is watching\" but in a time where everything costs 4 times what it did 5 years ago, I don't need to be reminded that Disney and Sony are getting billions of dollars while everyone I know is struggling.",

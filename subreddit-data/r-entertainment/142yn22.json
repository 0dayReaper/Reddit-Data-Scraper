The AI, just by staying coherent, will generate scenarios and interactions with immensely deep implications which the author's imagination would take months to develop, in mere hours.\n\nThat is the potential of this is.

However, Brooker soon realized that the output was not something that he could actually use.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve toyed around with ChatGPT a bit,\u201d Brooker told\u00a0Empire\u00a0in an interview. \u201cThe first thing I did was type \u2018generate\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0episode\u2019 and it comes up with something that, at first glance, reads plausibly, but on second glance, is sh*t.\u201d\n\nBrooker continued, \u201cBecause all it\u2019s done is look up all the synopses of\u00a0Black Mirror\u00a0episodes, and sort of mush them together. Then if you dig a bit more deeply you go, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s not actually any real original thought here.\u2019 It\u2019s [1970s impressionist] Mike Yarwood \u2014 there\u2019s a topical reference.\u201d\n\nChatGPT only pulls from what is already out there and doesn\u2019t create something new, which Brooker realized when playing with the software. The\u00a0new season of the series will be dropped on June 15\u00a0featuring a star-studded cast that includes Aaron Paul, Michael Cera, Salma Hayek Pinault, Myha\u2019la Herrold and Kate Mara.\n\nHayek is featured in the episode titled \u201cJoan Is Awful\u201d which follows an average woman that is stunned when she finds out that a streamer has made a show about her life and where she\u2019s portrayed by Hayek. The episode was written by Brooker and directed by Ally Pankiw. Other actors in the episode include Annie Murphy, Ben Barnes, Himesh Patel, Michael Cera and Rob Delaney.",

Eventually, these things are going to be able to write movies and television series just as well as a paid writer. AI will be replacing many, many positions in many different fields, entertainment is certainly going to be a part of that. I don't know how it will look in the long run, but more than likely it will be a combination of AI and less human writers.",

But no, its going to replace our artists, writers, and musicians first.  Apparently human creativity is the easiest thing to replace with programming tech - not working at McDonalds or coal mines.",

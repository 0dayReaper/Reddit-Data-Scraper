He was a huge bitch, came on way late, played a shitty set and everyone threw glow sticks at him.  He blamed Pearl Jam who came on before him which made no sense.  Fuck Kanye was spray painted prominently at the venue the following morning.  14 years later I continue to be amazed that people are surprised by his behavior.",

He was late for that set too and went on about how he was the greatest rapper that ever lived. I remember how thick the crowd leaving was, almost like I was being carried away in a river. That\u2019s how many people wanted to leave his set. Totally wild.",

He was supposed to come on right after them for the late set. He bitched, they moved his whole stupid moon set over there. At the end of his set (which was terrible) all the lights go out and then when they turn back on he's supposed to have disappeared. Well the sun was coming up, so the whole crowd saw him get on his hands and knees and crawl off the stage down a little ladder! It was so fitting.",

Just bc someone\u2019s mentally ill doesn\u2019t mean we should have to subject ourselves to them out of some form of pity. Kanye deserves what he\u2019s getting. If he cared about other people, he stop being a narcissist and get help for his condition, instead he continues hurting others and leaning on the \u201cI\u2019m not well\u201d card. Someone like him, especially, who has nearly limitless access to treatment has very little excuse.",

The only way you can describe Adidas as being founded shortly after WWII is by ignoring that the \u201cfounding\u201d of Adidas and Puma was a result of a falling out between the Dassler brothers, both of whom were Nazi party members who used their factories to supply Nazi military forces with shoes and anti-tank weapons. Adolf Dassler, who specifically founded Adidas, was in the Hitler Youth. The actual company that Adidas splintered off from was formed in 1924. There is nothing about the Nazi brothers falling out and splitting into separate companies that says anything about those companies not putting up with anti-semitism.",

Heck I don\u2019t even totally understand because of all the intricacies. But like you guys are saying, with rich people money the vast majority is generally tied up and not \u201creal money\u201d (money that can be made into cash or used to buy stuff). It\u2019s tied up in stocks and investments and shares and ownership stakes and assumed gains that aren\u2019t actually proven etc. it would be a process to convert those things to cash/useable money, and some parts can\u2019t be converted, and with some converting them to cash means selling off a stake or ownership in something meaning losing the ability to earn future profit on it. \n\nSo the truth is even Kanye probably doesn\u2019t even have any true ideas of how much actual cash he has to use for daily living, and probably doesn\u2019t want to be in the position of having to start selling off assets/shares/etc. to have more available cash at hand because once someone starts doing that, it\u2019s a signal your wealth is on the decline and you\u2019ll have less or no passive money making going on. \n\nOf course, Kanye is lucky that royalty earnings are free and permanent (unless he sells the rights), so he\u2019ll have more income coming in for the foreseeable future. It should last his entire lifetime, but even though people will still listen to his older music in the next few years or so, if he truly goes off the deep end irreversibly and turns off even too many fans, there probably won\u2019t be many people listening to him anymore in a decade or two.",

Some of these cost a lot of money to maintain which eats into their actual dollars in the bank. If you lose a large chunk of what brings you in real cash, you won\u2019t be able to maintain your costs for long. A lot of rich people borrow on their assets and investments or other things. If you substantially decrease your incoming cash flow, the borrowing power decreases. \n\nIdk if my thoughts are correct, I\u2019ve gathered that info from browsing the finance/money Reddits while browsing.

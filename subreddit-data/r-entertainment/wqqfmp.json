Scripts and storyboards and all that goes into fleshing out an idea.\n\nThen one day, Ellen\u2019s team drops my friends\u2026but she still runs with the idea.\n\nNo compensation. No nothing. What are a couple of small town comedians with limited funds gonna do?\n\nThis was maybe 5 or 6 years ago and I\u2019m sure Ellen and her cronies have burned plenty of other people since then that can\u2019t fight back either.",

He is pictured as a child wearing a shirt that says \"Dick the Birthday Boy\" alongside Billy Bob Bear, a mascot for the now defunct restaurant ShowBiz Pizza Place.\n\nNotably, it appeared on The Ellen Degeneres Show in 2018, where the guest Julia Roberts revealed that she worked for ShowBiz Pizza, joking that she was the one in the bear costume.\n\nThe photo also was used in some edits which gave the photo a paedophilic connotation. A September 3rd, 2016 edit added the bear saying \"yas I will\" to the shirt reading \"dick the birthday boy\" \n\nSource: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dick-the-birthday-boy",

They lost a ton because they didn't know what to do with it, and combined with all the other shitty moves, AT&amp;T had no way to get cash into WarnerMedia. WarnerMedia needed cash for content.\n\nDiscovery came it with the cash needed, and together they have second largest fund for pure content. It was the largest until Disney one-upped them a few months later.\n\nUltimately that will mean a ton of new content in the next few years. What kind is the question. If they are smart they will leave WB Films and HBO alone. If they are really smart they will lean into their gaming division which is peerless in Hollywood. No one in Hollywood had what they are sitting in when it comes to video games.",

Seems like everyone has a friend co-worker who Ellen was a over the top mean to but none have gone on the record or put stuff like that video out. \n\nAs of now no former co-workers have ever made a formal complaint or even gone on the record with the press with these stories. Everything has been unverified \"friend of a friend\" stories.\n\nEdit: 36 formal workplace complaints against three producers and zero against her. 40 year career with no paper trail, video, or sourced reporting her being \"mean\" to staff. I call bullshit.\n\nEdit2, my response to \"just Google around\" and \"I swear I've seen the video\".\n\nI've googled it a lot and it simply doesn't meet standards. It almost all comes from one Twitter thread where someone offered money for Ellen stories but only if they were mean stories. None of them were first hand and no users were verified. People like to complain and all those stories can easily be flipped on their head with context. \n\nIt's not even that I don't believe you've seen a video, it's your reaction to it I can't trust. The simplest explanation is that she's a little short with customer service and employees with a little of her monotone sense of humor being misinterpreted, and also people embellish when sharing celeb stories with their friends, and its all amplified by the usual bigot crowd ever present online. Not some damning pattern of monster behavior that's worth trashing a female and homosexual icons legacy over.

When I see a reboot or remake of a show that I have good memories of, I don't want to see a crap version with poor writing and bad casting.  And I will loudly call that shit out.  Especially when a show like Velma is clearly shitting on the originals for cheap political clout.\n\nWhy not just ignore it?  Because bad versions of beloved shows can destroy the brand and make it less likely to see a quality version in the future.",

Yes, you can call out crappy remakes, or any other piece of media that turns out to be crap.  It's just really stupid to ever use a phrase like \"It ruined my childhood.\"  Your childhood is still there, you can still watch the old stuff.\n\nNow if instead you say \"The crappy remake ruins the chances of future good installments\", that's better.  Though in the case of Velma inaccurate, as I'd bet good money that the Scooby Doo IP continues to get more titles.  Also didn't work for Last Airbender, that too got a sequel with Korra and is getting a live action show coming up.\n\nHell, in one instance a bad remake had the opposite effect.  Dragonball: Evolution was so horrible that it prompted Akira Toriyama to make Dragon Ball Super.  So yeah, by all means complain about crap sequels and remakes.  But don't act like these things tarnished your childhood.",

More of a throwaway hyperbole line.  Like saying the movie is so bad it makes me want to gouge out my eyes.  No one thinks anyone is gouging out thier eyes over a movie.  It is just an exaggerated expression of dislike.\n\nI do see people saying \"just ignore it if you don't like it\".  Which as I explained can have negative repercussions on seeing more content in that IP.  Yes there are franchises that have survived horrible sequels.  Star Wars would like a word.  But there are also plenty of cases where a really bad sequal/reboot/whatever killed momentum on a brand.",

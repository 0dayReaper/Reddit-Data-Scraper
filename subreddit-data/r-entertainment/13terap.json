The masterful, enveloping, and very long new film from Turkey\u2019s Nuri Bilge Ceylan unfolds in Anatolia\u2019s rural east, which up to that point has spent every minute on screen blanketed in winter, with the tough, scrubby plant life of the title hidden away in hibernation mode. \n\nIt\u2019s an approach that might have been described as novelistic if it wasn\u2019t also so intent on visual pleasures. Yes, the screenplay is as wordy as usual for this director, with dialogue scenes that ramble on for upwards of 10 minutes. But just as the characters use talk to build up their defences, the camera slyly unpicks them. In both Ceylan\u2019s writing and the mesmerisingly plausible four central performances, there\u2019s a deep and forgiving understanding of human psychology at work that keeps you sympathetic to Samet\u2019s plight, no matter how awfully he behaves.\n\n**Read the review in full: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/about-dry-grasses-cannes-festival-review/**",

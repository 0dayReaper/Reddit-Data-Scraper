And there\u2019s no easy way to mourn somebody who is gone but still sitting right in front of you and still needs you to take care of themselves. \n\nIt\u2019s a grief that confounds with guilt for a lot of people and it\u2019s devastating to watch somebody deteriorate into a fraction of what they were. \n\nYes, their body is still alive. And someone is in there looking out. But the person you know, whose memories are shared with you, who you could commiserate with, and have conversations with, that person is dead and they\u2019re not coming back.",

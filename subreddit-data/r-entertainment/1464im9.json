Like, if she happens to be smiling when the photo is taken, fine, but under no circumstances will she smile FOR a photo. If Paul Bettany wants a picture of her smiling he has to make a joke first then whip out the camera like a ninja.\n\nI guess in this case the joke was not funny because Agnes doesn't seem impressed, either.",

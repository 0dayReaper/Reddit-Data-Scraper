Reagan drew a line, with conservatives on one side, and everyone else on the other. But I don't blame Reagan alone... he was just one part of a shift in society away from equality and towards preserving the rich white boys club that had always run things to then. Only Reagan was coy about it, delivering that divisiveness with an 'awe shucks' snakey smile... unlike the Orange Dumpster Fire who comes right out and says \"Stand back and stand by.\" IOW, it's just gotten worse since then, but I do believe it's all on the way to being purged.

There's a growing awareness of inequality and injustice and a hunger to right those things. Toward the end of the 90's gay rights became something we all really became aware of and people drug their heels and wanted to incrementally give them little bits of rights. \n\nSame thing is happening with the trans panic right now but far, far more people are furious that these Republicans are pushing vicious laws to hurt them. There's more people more ready to just stop with all this BS and say \"give them all the rights, protect them with anti-hate crime laws, and force these bigots to play nice or else.\" \n\nI think there's a reorientation of the best way to live and people, according to polls anyways, moving away from the big house and the expensive cars and the 1980's greed is good kind of world that was built in the Reagan era of false promises and grift. Climate Change is motivating a lot of people to want to take steps to improve their world and the world of their neighbors. \n\nThe problem is the assholes of the world suck all the air out of the room and they always will.

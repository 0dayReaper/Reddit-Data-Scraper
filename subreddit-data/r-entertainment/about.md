Description:

For news and discussion of the entertainment industry.

Rules:

Off-topic posts will be removed.: Things that are entertaining (board games, "funny" videos, etc) do not count as Entertainment News.

Also, politicians and members of the world's various Royal Families are not entertainers, please don't post about them here. People who were once actors but became Royals or politicians (e.g. Grace Kelly, Ronald Reagan, Meghan Markle) are excepted if the post is about their career in the entertainment industry.

Don't spam.: Don't spam. No one wants to see your YouTube video about "Sexy Office Romance Stripping" or the "Best hair shaving prank 2018 ( gone wrong)". Don't even think about posting your blogspam, YouTube spam, or domain spam here, thank you. We are not here for self promotion.

No abusive comments.: Abusive comments. If there's a point you want to make please do so, but name-calling or verbal abuse may result in a ban. Use the report function to flag abusive comments rather than responding and escalating.

No trolls.: Trolls and brigaders will be banned summarily.

No racism or hate speech.: Racism and hate speech will not be allowed. Those making such comments will be banned.

Sexist language will not be tolerated.

No misinformation.: Deliberately spreading or repeating misinformation will result in a ban. This includes but is not limited to  unfounded allegations about celebrities and denial of COVIDâ€‘19 safety measures.

Editorialized titles: Posts with editorialized titles may be removed.

Continual repost: Check to see if the content had already been shared prior to blindly hitting submit. Continual reposts will result in action being taken.

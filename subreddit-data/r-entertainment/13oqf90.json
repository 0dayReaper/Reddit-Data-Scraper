There was then some controversy from Chinese netizens who pointed out that Chen has previously criticised the CCP for e.g. the treatment of the Uighurs, Tiananmen Square, etc., so Ng deleted the video and posted an apology, saying he hadn't been aware of Chen's \"incorrect comments about China\". There was then a backlash against Ng on the western internet for either bowing down to the CCP following the netizens' backlash, or self-censoring in anticipation of such a negative response on account of him deleting it exceptionally quickly.",

Taiwan's government is founded on the claim that its the rightful sovereign over the mainland... which is kinda the source of the conflict. The thing is, decades later the people of Taiwan no longer really care about that claim, but the government has yet to formally drop it. What's more interesting is that the pro-independence movement in Taiwan points out that the government in Taiwan [never even formally claimed authority *over the island of Taiwan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_China#Challenge_of_legitimacy)....\n\n&gt;Pro-independence advocates have argued that the Constitution was never legally applied to Taiwan because Taiwan was not formally incorporated into the ROC's territory through the National Assembly as per the specifications of Article 4. Though the constitution promulgated in 1946 did not define the territory of the Republic of China, while the draft of the constitution of 1925 individually listed the provinces of the Republic of China and Taiwan was not among them, since Taiwan was part of Japan as the result of the Treaty of Shimonoseki of 1895.\n\nEdit, to be clear, these pro-independence advocates point this out as a motivation to just establish a totally new government not founded on the history of the chinese civil war and therefore finally completely independent.\n\nAll I'm trying to say is international politics is often more complicated than you think.",

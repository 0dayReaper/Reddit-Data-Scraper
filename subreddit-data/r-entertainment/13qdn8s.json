I honestly don't get all the hate the last season got because to me that was like the exact quality I think could have been reasonably expected. There was a steep drop in quality right after season 4 when they caught up with the books, how anybody could have thought they were going to turn that around in the final episodes and give us an amazing finale is beyond me.",

Season 5 is a boring slog to get through, that whole Xena the warrior princess side-quest in Dorne, you can tell they intentionally slowed down the pace of the show in a futile hope Martin would actually manage to finish the books. Then after that season 6 was like a locomotive trying to rush us to the end, it's easily guilty of most of the same faults that get pointed out in seasons 7 and 8 just with a couple more episodes.\n\nLike I've heard all the arguments why seasons 7 and 8 are so bad, what's the argument that seasons 5 and 6 are actually good?",

All they did was make that entire debacle popular by spending money and time on it, launching those assholes into stardom. Granted, they didn\u2019t let it go, but that was a really hefty buildup for a bunch of garbage that not even the actors are proud of. Pretty sure they have every right to be pissed about that. \n\nI\u2019m glad the fans harped on it. Those dudes don\u2019t deserve to have jobs in writing for shows with large fandoms. If I fuck up at my job, and someone paid me a fuckload of money to do it, and I just fucked off to go focus on a more lucrative project, I would not expect to keep that career. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m missing here. \n\nThe fans didn\u2019t even have time to get as annoying as most others. I didn\u2019t get into the books, I didn\u2019t dress up like a weirdo at conventions, and was a late adopter, but all that seemed 1000% justified. Nobody should tolerate that. Grab a pitchfork, because that is utter nonsense. \n\nAnd, not gonna lie, it was really fun. Sometimes nerds have pretty good ideas when they aren\u2019t all mouthy and cocky about stuff. It was super cool that everybody was unified and got into this story together. My roommates and I made it a weekly thing where we got calzones for Game of Calzones night. (If you can\u2019t push \u2018em into lockers and give them swirlies, may as well join \u2018em.)",

She flies like an ace, is combat ready with a Saber from the go and is able to tap into Force abilities *so powerful* it drove Anakin Skywalker to fall to the Dark side if it meant learning them. Even compared to Luke, at the end of the OT Luke was at best a mid tier level Jedi in terms of his training. Rey seemingly starts off at peak power.\n\nIt\u2019s worth saying too; I think ***all*** the Sequel characters were poorly written, in fact I could make the argument Kylo\u2019s writing was easily ten times worse than Rey. But in short: I don\u2019t hate Rey but I wouldn\u2019t say I enjoyed her character enough to be interested in a series dedicated to her restarting the Jedi order.",

Not exactly how talent works between generations, but he's a character in a movie.\n\nAlso, it was basically a desperate suicide attack where lots - and lots - of the people flying with Luke died to make his attack run work.\n\nFinally, Luke destroyed the Death Star by trusting himself and using space torpedoes on a hunch (or as the force guided him to) because the targeting system that was supposed to guide them was shown to be inaccurate earlier in the film.",

You were looking forward to it all year like you did a new release of a movie. \n\nBut then when you get it? Well, five out of the ten stories are some idealized self-insert who is just the bestest at everything and so pretty and awesome, fucking the author's favorite character, making the other canon characters look incompetent, etc.\n\nAnd hey, we all have that fantasy. We all have this dream of joining our fave characters on their adventures, and not as our schlubby, grubby real selves, but as this awesomely competent superstar. Every fucking fan author has done this. It's like wanking. Problem is, unless it's your partner or you are some kind of big time porn actor, no one's gonna want to watch you wank.  \n\nAnd that was the intended message of the Mary Sue. Basically a frustrated fan author telling other fan writers to please move on to a story other than the One Everyone Writes and is boring as hell for anyone other than you to read.",

See: Game of Thrones fans, Harry Potter fans, Star Wars, LotR fans, and so on.\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue described by the author that pertains to so many things beyond just sex/purity:\n\n&gt;  Fans of the era adopted an eagerness to label absolutely everything even slightly complicated as \u201cproblematic,\u201d and that easily translated into harassment of others who still enjoyed those now-tainted stories and creators.\n\nIt\u2019s people who make a pastime out of finding \u201cproblematic\u201d issues with this or that ostensibly benign pop culture thing or public figure. For example, how, in some circles, you can\u2019t mention the Beatles without some jackass popping up to say \u201cWell *ackshually* John Lennon beat his first wife so it\u2019s pretty fucked up that you enjoy art produced by a domestic abuser\u201d. Another, more recent example that is driving me bonkers are the kids who insist that the movie *Idiocracy* is VERY PROBLEMATIC for \u201cpromoting eugenics\u201d and that anyone enjoys the movie is either an explicit supporter of eugenics or an idiot for not realizing that that is what the movie is \u201call about\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s the never-ending \u201cI can find something to be offended by\u201d Olympics with these people.",

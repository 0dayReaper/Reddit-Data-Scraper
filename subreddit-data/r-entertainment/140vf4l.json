            "comment": "&gt; Tyler James Williams shared a heartfelt message on social media during Pride Month addressing his sexuality. **'The Abbott Elementary' actor made it clear that he is not gay but speculating about people that are queer or questioning their sexuality might be contributing to negatively impacting their mental health.**\n\n&gt; \u201c**Usually I wouldn\u2019t address stuff like this, but I feel like it as a conversation is bigger than me. I\u2019m not gay, but I think the culture of trying to \u2018find\u2019 some kind of hidden trait or behavior that a closed person \u2018let slip\u2019 is very dangerous,**\u201d Williams stated in his Instagram Stories. \n\n&gt; He continued, \u201c**Overanalyzing someone\u2019s behavior in an attempt to \u2018catch\u2019 them directly contributes to the anxiety a lot of queer and queer-questioning people feel when they fear living in their truth.** It makes the most pedestrian of conversations and interactions in spaces feel less safe for our gay brothers and sisters and those who may be questioning.\u201d\n\n&gt; The Everybody Hates Chris alum added, \u201c**It also reinforces an archetype many straight men have to live under that is oftentimes unrealistic, less free, and limits individual expressing.**\u201d\n\n\n&gt; Williams said that he has be using his platform \u201cto push back against those archetypes,\u201d noting that \u201c**being straight doesn\u2019t look one way. Being gay doesn\u2019t look one way.**\u201d",

This was early 90's when I was around 11 or 12. \n\nI'm 43 now and I **still** get self conscious about making sure to keep my wrists rigged when doing things.\n\nEven after I realized it was stupid and there was nothing negative or wrong about being gay I still have it ingrained in me to avoid doing things that would make anyone think *I* was.

It feels like using the word truth in this context devalues its meaning as an objective statement of fact.  We deal with versions of the truth, but people are dropping the word \"versions\" to just say \"my truth\" vs \"your truth\".",

Some sort of thing you slip into if you have anything outside of perfect behavior?\n\nFor the sake of LGBT people AND straight people, I beg of you fuckers, stop this bullshit. Let people be who they are. A straight man can be as he is. A gay man can be as he is. And if they act in the exact same way and have the exact same hobbies, it doesn\u2019t fucking matter.\n\nEdit cuz I feel like it: obviously this also applies to women and NB people. Speculating about someone\u2019s sexuality in real life is rude as fuck.",

It\u2019s because it\u2019s super weird to be like \u201cOmg hee hee he\u2019s trans\u201d\n\nSpeaking about gay stuff again, as a kid I did go through a phase for a couple months where I was like \u201comg who is gay?\u201d But then I got a little more mature and realized I just wanted the idea of other gay actors, instead of appreciating who actuallly was gay. And when I looked into the actors who were gay and lesbian, it made me so much happier because I wasn\u2019t trying to push my weird ships into real life. \n\nIn my opinion, from what I\u2019ve heard, certain straight people do this behavior as well. In Korea and the Philippines, for example, I\u2019ve heard that actors will get paired up by fans with such intensity that their managers realize they have to play into it. The actors are cast together and put together in projects. To go against the imagined relationship risks upsetting the fans and losing popularity. It\u2019s literally just parasocial relationships.",

Cas literally referred to Sam and Dean as family a number of times and they all loved each other like brothers. \n\nTo me, it's just another instance of two men having a close, brotherly bond where they're not afraid to show emotion and care for each other, and the fans deciding \"THEY MUST BE GAY!\"",

I liken it to larping, because pretending that they're gay or ace or simply just being able to resonate with them in those ways might comfort quite a few people out there. They're not real, you know. \n\nMost people who write that ship dont actually believe Tolkien wrote them with the intentions of them being lovers. But the arts wouldnt be the arts if they were only allowed to be taken and applied in one specific way. \n\nThere are people who treat their fellow dudes exactly as Sam and Frodo treated each other and therefore see it as nothing but friendship. For others, that is not the case and so therefore it comes across as romantic. If I'm not mistaken, Sean Astin himself supports the idea of his portrayal of Sam having had some sort of level of romantic feelings for Frodo. \n\nEither way, everyone perceives the arts just a little bit differently.

Fans are still convinced he's gay and every relationship he's had is a cover. He could literally shout from the rooftops that he's marrying a woman and invite all his fans to the wedding, and people would still say that he's just hiding and conforming to peer pressure because he's afraid to be out. I mean, the guy is VERY comfortable in his own skin, doesn't give a shit about being stereotypically masculine, wears feather boas and dances around with rainbow flags on stage, do you really think he'd feel the need to hide if he was gay?",

Sexuality has been forced to become a forefront of ones personally. Conversations about both are met with vitriol and hostility on all sides of the political spectrum.  Meanwhile, for the average person, virtually none of these things are all that relevant on a daily basis.  \n\nI'm very much a supporter of normalizing all of these things, but that can't really be done when it's so aggressively highlighted in all forms of media.  \n\nIt's frustrating when there are  people passing legislation to directly attack specific groups of people,  and the ones supporting those agendas are spouting \"we don't want these things shoved down our throats,\" and then you see things like this article that are easily used to push forward a hateful narrative against certain marginalized groups. Even if it's just one example,  it's easy to take one example and stretch it as thin as possible. \n\nWe need to do better if we want these things to be taken more seriously and not have them seem like a trend to the point of trivializing people's lifestyles. It's really not hard to care, but also not care at the same time.",

That\u2019s a tremendous amount of money but you turned it down. James didn\u2019t deny the amount. He just explained why he was leaving. So if this article is accurate, which seems likely , then he could not have possibly been offered that much money to stay. His reported net worth is 70 million so he already made his money. It seems like his PR team was trying to spin it that he was turning down millions by leaving to make him look good.",

So that\u2019s definitely not nothing but when you\u2019re talking about like Jonah Hill or somebody that\u2019s chump change to them. They absolutely aren\u2019t showing up because of the pay. As somebody else said I\u2019m sure the studio for any given film is probably paying the actor decently to be there, whereas the talk show probably isn\u2019t paying an enticing amount",

They usually get what\u2019s called scale, which is, or was, one of the lower rates.

Clay had a bit part as a flying monkey way back in high school in a production of The Wiz. He absolutely stole the show in a 2 minute part by actually riding his moped around the stage during his flying scenes. We lost touch after he moved to New York, but I know he worked with Conan for at least 10 years. He was born for show business, but usually worked on sets and stage management.",

Dave\u2019s 11:30 deal with CBS back in 1993 gave him the rights to own the 12:30 show after his, and he chose Tom Snyder, which is easy to assume was very cheap to produce. \n\nAt the end of Snyder\u2019s contract, CBS asked for WP to pick a new host to better compete with Conan. WP chose Craig Kilborn and eventually Craig Ferguson, and I get the feeling WP tried to keep the show as cheap to produce as possible. Kilborn made a few references to this, and Ferguson joked about it almost nightly (I miss Ferguson\u2019s show so much). \n\nUntil the last year or so of Ferguson when CBS stepped in as a co-owner of the show and they put more money in and moved the show to a larger stage. The show felt like it changed a bit there. \n\nThen Ferguson decided to leave, CBS took full ownership, and seemed to spare no expense on competing with Fallon. They got someone who on the surface was Fallon-like: upbeat and laughy, and tried to make every segment a viral hit. \n\nThey got what they wanted. Fallon had a spin-off show for Lip Sync Battle and Corden had Carpool Karaoke. Clips of the show were constantly viral on YouTube. Until that all changed during the pandemic and most talk shows don\u2019t seem to get the same buzz. \n\nI never really cared for Corden, but I\u2019m very happy that this means 12:30 on CBS will bring back @midnight from Comedy Central, which was one of my favorite shows back in the day. I assume this will also be pretty cheap to produce if it could survive a few years as the third talk show on Comedy Central.",

Peter Lasally gave an interview to the Television Academy where he spoke about how limited, unread, and unlikeable he was. Lasally wanted Jon Stewart to replace Snyder. The Basic podcast about basic cable with Doug Herzog had on Daily Show creators Madeline Smithberg and Lizz Winstead, and Smithberg, a former producer for Late Night with Letterman, was asked to be the an executive for the show replacing Snyder. They couldn\u2019t say they had Kilborn, but she assumed and warned them she didn\u2019t believe he could fill an hour. Winstead and Smithberg both explained they never wanted Kilborn alone on press interviews with publications without a Daily Show writer to assist. The one time Kilborn had a solo interview, he made an inappropriate joke against Winstead, causing him to be suspended a week without pay and her to want to leave. It doesn\u2019t seem like Kilborn is very well liked. Aside from his comfort in front of a camera, Kilborn is insanely lucky he got where he did.\n\nEDIT: Clarification",

CBS never wanted Snyder. Letterman wanted Snyder because he wanted to watch that show and wants a show like that to be on the air (Letterman's Netflix show is more like Snyder's than what Letterman did before), and he probably still felt guilty about his Late Night replacing the Tomorrow show. CBS honored the ownership agreement but it was still a fact that ratings affected advertising rates and eventually Letterman had to face the business reality that owning the time slot wouldn't mean anything if he lost affiliate clearances.",

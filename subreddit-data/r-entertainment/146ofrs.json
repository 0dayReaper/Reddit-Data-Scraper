Nope, he's only famous for being one of Brittany Spears' dancers and the father of her children who now uses her as his meal ticket. A shameless piece of shit to the core.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[He is known for his two-year marriage to American singer Britney Spears, for whom he was previously a backup dancer, and the child custody battle that followed, which earned significant media coverage. His popularity led to him releasing his critically panned debut album Playing with Fire in 2006, which is commonly considered to be one of the worst albums ever released.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Federline)",

I remember people mocking him constantly for marrying a woman who was more successful than him - even calling him a lazy mooch.\n\nHe was a dancer. He had worked as a dancer for Michael Jackson and Justin Timberlake amongst many other acts. That\u2019s essentially the height of success for that career path - and it\u2019s a physically demanding career that requires a lot of real effort.\n\nWhen he appeared on WWE to promote his music, the organization and performers absolutely loved working with him. He was able to do the choreography well, obviously, and many wrestlers spoke at the time about how great his attitude was backstage. As a result WWE gave him a recurring role.\n\nHe currently works as a DJ, not exactly the big headline performer kind of DJ, but you know, the kind of DJ that people do hire for events and stuff.\n\nAny specific reasoning he would be unemployable? I\u2019m honestly asking because I was on the hate train hard for the guy and when I tried to be objective about it I couldn\u2019t really justify why I had such a low opinion of the guy.",

That in itself wouldn't at all be unusual/rare/unlikely etc. However I've heard so many people in my life refer to RX stimulants used to treat ADHD as \"legal meth\" or \"mine as well be meth\" or  literally just \"meth- iTs tHe sAmE tHiNg\". I think it screams obvious that they don't have her best interest at heart, and instead see her as a cash cow...be it family or kfed really..  so making accusations like that in an attempt to discredit her is aor for the course. Or would be par for the course. \n\n\nAbsolutely comes off like another attempt to jeopardize her freedom. Even if she is unstable for any reason...  Most of us are at this point. That in and of itself means nothing (to me), with the resources andoney she has access to she's still gonna be better taken care of than most of by us ever could imagine.....and that can be done without removing her ability to have action over herself. Sur where videos may seem eccentric but like .. look at her life. It reminds me in a way, of the \"weirdness\" around Michael Jackson's life (not the controversies just the weirdness) ....but there's a certain level of \"weird\" and social abnormalities that comes with fame at the levels they live it at. Like... I kinda expected super famous people like that to be a little weird or eccentric just because their entire life has been far different than a \"normal\" person's. Personally I've not seen anything in any of her public vids or posts that suggest anything other than just that, weirdness. But weirdness in itself doesn't mean she can't take care of herself you know? \n\n\nIdk the whole thing makes me feel sad for her regardless. Fuck her 'family' and the cultures that have preyed on her, literally her entire life.",

But she's trying. She wants to live a happy drama free life and they just keep spreading vicious lies about her and people will believe it!\n\nShe definitely should move out of LA and go somewhere less stressful if she wants but she's not doing anything bad by calling them out.",

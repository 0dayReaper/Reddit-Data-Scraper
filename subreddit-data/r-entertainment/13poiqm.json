Good Christ in heaven, with that much money, you couldn't afford to shoot a scene on an actual ski slope?\n\nHad the show not done that whole poorly conceived and hideously executed James Bond knockoff sequence, I could still argue for the show on merit as a darker espionage thriller, but that mess deserves all the hate and more. \n\nI'll might finish it out, but it's nowhere near a priority for me.",

The worldbuilding, even if logically inconsistent at times, makes narrative and thematic sense and effectively sets up interesting complications for the story. The sense of pacing and rhythm is *exceptionally* well-thought-out, to the point where they were able to stretch 4 to 3 fucking hours and it still pretty much works. The action scenes go *very far out of their way* to do new and exciting things that other movies aren't doing, and advance the craft of stunt work and fight choreography instead of simply playing the hits. There's an extremely well-thought-out and coherent visual identity to the movies beyond \"Keanu is in them.\" There's *actual effort* put into stuff that the vast majority of \"dumb\" entertainment just assumes you're not going to care about.\n\n\"Dumb\" entertainment should be so in the sense that it doesn't require the **viewer** to think about it too hard. If the **creators** aren't thinking about it too hard, shit just falls apart.",

What use is the fist there except to achieve an 'avengers style' pose? Every ad I see for it reeks of that pathetic posing.

I think it's fun and wonder why the internet is so interested in trashing things. \n\nIf you like 24, or Bourne Identity, or Bond or Mission Impossible.... you might like it. Fun things are fun.

We\u2019re talking dropping a couple of g\u2019s. I mean 1k alone on the sound system alone given a receiver is like $500 and even a 5.1 set would run you another $500. A powered subwoofer at minimum would be another $100 for a 10 inch mono price. \n\nI\u2019m huge on both being an audio and video phile. But frankly even with my setup I\u2019ve found myself just gravitating towards streaming more and more. I haven\u2019t even bought physical media outside of a few vinyls, which of course is a whole other can of worms.",

And in the context of this thread the original post is about Aubrey Plaza who certainly shouldn\u2019t have an issue affording a nice tv and sound system and Blu-ray player.\n\nI have a pretty good tv set up now and a year ago I never even thought about using 4k blurays but after getting some 4k blurays of my favorite movies it definitely converted me. It definitely is way better quality than streaming, it looked so good that it almost felt like I was watching the movie for the first time again. \n\nAnd I mean it makes sense why it would be a lot better, I\u2019m pretty sure 4k quality takes a crazy amount of data, most people\u2019s internet couldn\u2019t handle all of that just immediately streaming. And of course with the disk you never have a moment where something is a little off and buffering\n\nBut yeah practically speaking for a lot of reasons, of course streaming is more convenient and I do it plenty. But for specific stuff where it\u2019s a movie or something that you really love I do think the full glory of watching it on a 4k Blu-ray is a pretty awesome experience",

I bought physical copies of the Office when it left Netflix for like $50. A year of Peacock is $100. \n\nPeople balk at the cost of physical media but lots of Blu-Rays are now in the $10-15 range *new.* Lots of people who aren't rich have multiple streaming subscriptions. Netflix alone for the standard plan is almost $200 a year. If you don't watch a ton of movies physical media isn't really much more expensive, gives you lifetime, unlimited access to your collection with no perpetual fees, and gives you higher audio and visual quality. I have one streaming sub, but mostly buy physical media at a local store that sells new and used physical media of all types. I think I got my Sopranos box set for like $25. 86 hours of content, equivalent to 57 90-minute feature films. \n\nAlso also, buying a movie on iTunes or Prime isn't physical media.",

Basically the article says she can\u2019t figure out how to sign up for streaming.\n\nHowever I will say that the fact there isn\u2019t much of a market like DVDs where people pay on a per movie or per season basis probably is a bit of a setback in some ways for what kindof entertainment gets produced. Content people will pay for tends to be higher level of quality and profits made off that content were easier to calculate and share.\n\nWith streaming -  the value delivered by a given show or movie is opaque. Sure viewership is easier to figure out but whether people like the content so much they\u2019d pay for that movie or episode specifically is hard to figure out. And the value a given movie generates is harder to figure out to compensate those who worked on it properly.\n\nBut the cat is out of the bag in any case. I\u2019m never paying per season or per movie again barring some giant technological leap forward that changes the paradigm yet again.",

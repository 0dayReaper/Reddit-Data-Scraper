That just goes to prove there is no moral decency any more. I hope this moves bombs out in the theater and ends up cost them everything they put into it. I hope they get negative scores on Rotten Tomato.",

Or the other numerous movies that have had deaths on set. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, but there\u2019s a whole lot more that goes into film making and people\u2019s livelihoods that have been calendared to earn money for that period of time. \n\nFolks die at work and in offices due to accidents more that you\u2019d know, but work doesn\u2019t just halt.",

I guess maybe the family might feel like completely stopping or getting rid of the film would make her death more meaningless \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nNot sure how the family feels *now*. Supposedly they supported the charges against Baldwin.",

This incident involved someone who would make this politically charged, so all of the people who are suddenly weapons safety experts online rushed to chime in with their prepared soundbites in every thread about it. That's probably why this incident seems like some kind of industry cataclysm to you.",

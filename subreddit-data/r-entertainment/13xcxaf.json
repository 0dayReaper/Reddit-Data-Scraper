If anybody watched this \"documentary\" they would have observed that this was a clear case of racism and cultural appropriation.  It was not just Cleopatra that was presented as black.  It was the whole of her family and entourage, essentially all of Egypt.\n\nIn addition, visually the whole period was gutted.  The stages were all at least 1200 years out of date, with representations and architectural themes from the New Kingdom (the period of Thutmoses and Ramses II).  Essentially, the whole \"Greek\" element was wiped away.  Alexandria, where the events occurred, was a very Greek city, with typical Greek architecture as we know from detailed descriptions of the city and city iconography.  So, a large part of Egyptian history was wiped away.\n\nIn addition, this was done with \"malice\".  Both Jada Smith and the director made abundantly clear that they had a political/racial motive in their depiction of the period.  Therefore, considering that defamation requires motive, this was made clear by the creators of the \"documentary\".  So, I think that a court would have no choice than to conclude that this was \"cultural theft\" propagated by a bunch of US Afrocentrists and it should award damages",

I understand the anger.\n\nBut I do find it bizarre that Ancient Aliens has never been sued, yet we are suing Netflix for something many know is bunk. While people believe that my people were so fucking stupid we couldn't build beautiful and complex architecture. Ancient Aliens did it to Egypt too. Pop Culture Detective had an amazing episode on how detrimental things like Ancient Aliens are to indigenous cultures. And yes Black folks in America are displaced indigenous people from Africa.\n\nYes Afrocentric thinking can and has gone too far. I still think it's telling that Egypt is suing Netflix, but to my knowledge has not gone after Ancient Aliens. A show that is very popular and has over 10 fucking seasons.",

Where it applies, the fair report privilege can help you avoid what is known as republication liability. In general, in most jurisdictions, you can be held liable for repeating a false, defamatory statement made by someone else. Republication liability can make, for example, a newspaper liable for publishing a defamatory letter to the editor, or for quoting someone\u2019s defamatory statement in an article. In the documentary film context, republication liability could arise from the use of interview footage in which the interviewee says something defamatory, even if the film itself does not take a position on the matter. Documentarians should be aware of the risk of republication liability and always ask sources and interviewees to provide support for, and take steps to independently verify, factual assertions that, if repeated in a film, could subject the filmmaker to the risk of a defamation claim.",

A documentary film or documentary is a non-fictional motion-picture intended to \"document reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction, education or maintaining a historical record\".\n\nMy grandmother was the inspiration for me. I would come home and tell her what I was learning,\u201d says Shelley P Haley, professor of Africana studies at Hamilton College, New York. \u201cAnd I remember clear as day her saying to me, \u2018Shelley, I don\u2019t care what they tell you in school \u2013 Cleopatra was black.\u2019 And that\u2019s that.\u201d  If your gonna make a claim that will go against the consensus of most historians using your \"grandma\" as a legitimate source in a historical documentary is probably not a good idea. I do t know why they even decided to include this.\n\nAdele James addressed the backlash during a recent appearance on \u201cThe Wayne Ayers Podcast.\u201dBlackwashing isn\u2019t a thing, is it?\u201d she said. \u201cI find it sad that people are either so self-loathing or so threatened by Blackness that they feel the need to do that, to separate Egypt from the rest of the continent. This honestly come off condensing and makes it seem like eqyptians are not aware of their own history and are racists.\n\nBut for the sake of argument let's say Cleopatra was part sub-saharan, the documentary protray almost all of her family members as black. Removing all aspects of Macedonian and Greek aspects. The potemlys were the Targaryens of our reality, meaning they were incredibly inbred or married almost exclusively within the Greek elites. So even if Cleopatra was part sub-saharan because we do not know the identify of her mother, this does not extend to the rest of her family. The potemlys dynasty is one of the most well documented family lines. Meaning people did not make the family tree of Cleopatra 300 or 400 years later, but the eqyptians themselves documented in real time. Edit Netflix dies claim that Cleopatra is supposed to be mix decent which is most likely true but as I stated above their Cleopatra does not seem mixed when they made her whole family black. This makes it seem like Cleopatra is completely of sub-saharan history or as some are now claiming an American one.\n\nMost of Netflix's problem will go away if they just lose the documentary tag.",

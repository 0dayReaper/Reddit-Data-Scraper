But I\u2019m fairly sure The Pot-au-Feu, which premiered in competition at Cannes, is the first to make me reel at its butter budget.\n\nIn this mouth-watering banquet of full-fat foodie cinema from the Vietnamese-French director Tran Anh Hung, there are lashings of the stuff everywhere: melting, sizzling, drizzling, being whipped, folded and churned, and making every image it appears in glisten with deliciousness.\n\nTran\u2019s first film since 2016\u2019s Eternity is an adaptation of a 1926 comic novel by the Swiss author Marcel Rouff about a legendary gourmet called Dodin Bouffant, who here is nicknamed \u201cthe Napoleon of the culinary arts\u201d and is endearingly played by Beno\u00eet Magimel. The year is 1885; the location a picturesquely crumbling chateau in Pissarro-canvas rural France. For the last two decades here, Dodin has employed a brilliant cook called Eug\u00e9nie Chatagne, played with real wit and delicacy by Juliette Binoche: the two have also fallen in love, though Dodin\u2019s numerous offers of marriage have been thus far rebuffed.\n\nTran, a practised sensualist, is superb at depicting food as a vehicle for pleasure: a cut from a preserved pear lying languorously on a dessert plate to Binoche\u2019s naked form in bed is typical of his film\u2019s tactile approach. Crucially, though, it also recognises that cooking, not eating, is where that pleasure begins. In The Pot-au-Feu, it brings both nourishment and delight, which might make it the fundamental act of love.\n\n**Read this review in full:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/the-pot-au-feu-cannes-2023-review-tran-anh-hung/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/the-pot-au-feu-cannes-2023-review-tran-anh-hung/)",

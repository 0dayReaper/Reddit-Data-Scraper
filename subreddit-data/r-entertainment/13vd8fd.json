I don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy. The way the fan base reacts to the show now is not how it was when I first started. I mean, we were getting death threats.\u201d\n\n&gt;  She continued, \u201c**Some of the most horrible things I\u2019ve ever seen in print in my life, and it\u2019s a reality show! It\u2019s a stupid show! I thought: \u2018It\u2019s time to go.\u2019** I\u2019m not sure how much longer that can exist in the zeitgeist, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\n\"The Vision\":\n\n&gt; Rinna\u2019s departure came a year after her mom Lois had died. In the same interview, the Veronica Mars alum says she had a vision of her mother that helped her make her final decision.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so wild because half the world will believe this, half the world will say, \u2018That\u2019s so weird,'\u201d she said. \u201c**I was sleeping and I heard her say to me, \u2018It\u2019s time for you to go.'**\u201d\n\n&gt; She continued, \u201c**I told a psychic and she said, \u2018Oh yeah, she\u2019s come to me and told me that. She wants you to be happy and follow your dream, but she says it\u2019s time for you to go.\u2019** I\u2019ve never told anybody that, except for the psychic. **I\u2019m guided by my mom, for sure.**\u201d",

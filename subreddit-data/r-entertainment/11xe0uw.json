[Drag is not inherently sexual by and of itself.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/political-rhetoric-false-claims-obscure-the-history-of-drag-performance)  This is a lie that the extreme-right tells, in order to make people angry at their latest target for fake outrage. The real goal here is to create a manufactured societal outrage against gender and sexual nonconforming minorities, to normalise bigotry.  In reality, as with any performance art, the show is styled after the audience. Should you see drag in a strip club then it might be lewd. But, for the same reason that the dressed-up actors in Sesame Street perform age-appropriate theatre, so do drag queens during the \"[Drag Story Time](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/11/im-just-trying-to-make-the-world-a-little-brighter-how-the-culture-wars-hijacked-drag-queen-story-hour)\" events. \n\nOn this subreddit our rules prohibit racism, sexism, bigotry and other forms of hatespeech. \n\nPlease keep that in mind while commenting.\n\nThank you,\n\nThe r/entertainment mod team.",

I have a shit ton of Republicans in my family and just out of curiosity I asked an aunt what about trans men, she said \"they'll never be women\" and I say \"no, trans men were born as female and have a vagina but they dress and act like men (i am a trans man who is closeted to this side of my family, and this is as easy of an explanation could make it for her, i force my voice higher, shave and wear fem clothes when i absolutely have to interact with thesee people) she seemed to stop and think for a second and I thought she was going to at least ask me a question or SOMETHING. Then she just starts going on about how my generation is brainwashed because \"they weren't born with vaginas, ONLY REAL WOMEN WERE BORN WITH VAGINAS. MEN WILLL NEVER BE WOMEN\". \nThey are seriously impaired. They view everything as political. They view everything as wrong that is different than them. The pandemic really brought out the worst in these family members because they stopped interacting with actual people and started only talking with their shitty Facebook groups that ended up being right wing echo chambers.  \nI have ONE very far right uncle who is starting to see the light. He is 80, he has gout and during the pandemic I took care of him. He was very solitary and independent even before the pandemic. I Brought him groceries and cooked his meals, cleaned etc. I started taking testosterone during this time, he made an offhand venomous remark about trans people and I don't know why that got to me. I started crying. He got visibly terrified and said \"what's wrong?????\" And I just spilled my guts about how I was trans and that I loved him so much and i don't want him to hate me. Before the pandemic i lost my house and was sick so i couldnt work, i lived out of my car for 6 months. He was the only family member who cared about how i was doing. He would invite me over to do my laundry and he would give me gift cards to grocery stores (i didnt ask for any of this and wouldnt ask to stay over or impose) He is a very stereotypically masculine man. Never shows emotion. I had to beg him to let me help him when his gout was flaring up because he's one of those suffer in silence types. He's a gun collector, owns a Harley motorcycle, was a mechanic for 50 years. Never seen a tear from him. He threw his arms around me and literally started sobbing, saying \"I'm sorry\" over and over and over and petting my hair. He told me that he will always support me and that \"people must be wrong. You aren't a bad person. I know you. So they must be wrong\" I was expecting him to be disgusted with me like the rest of my family would have been. The next time I went over to his house to bring him groceries he told me that he saw a documentary on trans kids on HBO and that he taped it so we could watch it together. He surprised me. I wish I could make them all see like he did. He forgets my pronouns and my name all the time but he's 80 and the fact that he will correct himself and makes an effort to relate to me means everything.",

                            "comment": "It's important to remember that this attack from the right isn't about drag at all.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. haven't had even a hint of an actual political platform since at least the 2012 \"post-mortem\" republican leadership presented. Leadership at the time actually touched on some of the actual problems with conservative politics in the U.S. - it excludes too many people, it's too confrontational, etc. They didn't really make any attempt to address them or offer real solutions, but there was at least some tiny hint of self-awareness that they're broadly disliked at the national population level.\n\nThe response by the majority of the party was to basically throw all that away and lean completely into full-on fascist insanity. Trump in 2016 is the most obvious example of that, but they also eliminated a lot of what we'd now consider \"moderate\" conservatives by booting them during primaries where the most radical right-wing voters consistently showed up, making room in the general races for legislators like Tuberville, Boebert, Gaetz, and Taylor-Green who only exist in the party to maintain and drive constantly increasing levels of performative outrage over increasingly ridiculous made-up problems.\n\nAt the local and state levels, you get things like these legislative attacks on drag shows, as well as attacks on education (the *completely* manufactured outrage of Critical Race Theory, which isn't being taught in any high school in America), attacks on women's health (abortion, bans on medication, attempts to ban even talking about menstruation), etc.\n\nThis has nothing to do with art, or drag, or morality. These attacks on drag shows are purely about defining a vulnerable outside group that can be easily demonized and assaulted. They don't care about drag one way or the other. It's not a mistake or an oversight that so many of the pols pushing these bigoted laws and attacks on drag shows have themselves been photographed in drag. They didn't care about drag until it became a way for them to craft an enemy to distract from their total lack of productive governance. For every right-winger in \"real america\" who actually is mad about drag, there are ten more who will stand absolutely firm by their belief that powderpuff football games are a sacrosanct part of their local football traditions.\n\nThere's nothing deep about these insane attacks. The politicians pushing them are literally just trying to create outside groups they can paint as enemies so that their supporters target those groups with harassment and violence instead of recognizing that the real root of so many of their social and economic problems are the conservative politicians they keep following and voting for.\n\nIf this country actually functioned as a proper, healthy democracy, the politicians pushing this type of dangerously radical agenda wouldn't have a voice at all, and they know this, so they're pushing further and harder into pure fascism - including creating fake enemies for their supporters to focus on and attack - in the hopes that they can get total control before it's too late for the normal people to stop them.\n\nIt's good that part of what Bacon is doing here isn't just attacking the lunatics, though, he's praising examples of the art form and helping to make it clear that there's nothing with it, it's perfectly harmless, and the attacks coming from radical right-wing politicians are just completely nuts.",

This is a very scared small group of people attempting to hold onto a power they think they are losing. They think the more extreme they go with their beliefs the more people will step over the line of violence to protect those beliefs. They don't need armies of people, just enough to disrupt society. The last 'throws' of a belief system are always the most extreme and violent moments. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*the US is becoming far more progressive than it has ever been, with that you get far more extreme on the other end in the few places it can keep hold. They are hoping they can stop the shift in rules allowing a fair system because if things are fair they will have absolutely no power. Just look at the majority of states that have changed their election systems so that republicans don't have a majority in a state government when they have a minority in people, a lot of good comes out of that they hate.",

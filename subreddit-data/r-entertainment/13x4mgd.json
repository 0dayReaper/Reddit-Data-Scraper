Robert Rodriguez just chilling. Right there. I felt like a total jerk. Sin City was still in theaters. Would have loved to get them both to sign From Dusk Til Dawn.",

To me, Ledger seems great in all his roles, but in Hamill's case I never liked his acting in Star Wars. I've liked his acting in other roles since. Am I missing something about his Star Wars performance or did he just vastly improve in between? Or is it just that the dialogue made him seem less good an actor, the way George Lucas kind of screwed Hayden Christensen?",

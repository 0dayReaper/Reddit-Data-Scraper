I thought scuttle was awkwardly voiced, but the scuttle butt song got laughs from both the 4 year old and the ten year old.  My first reaction to King Titan was he didn\u2019t seem intimidating enough but he grew on me by the end.  I thought the cast for human Ursula was perfect.  My ten year old thought Ariel was beautiful.  Overall, while I\u2019m not a huge fan of remakes, I thought this was the best so far.  Only parts I really didn\u2019t like was Eric\u2019s song, and then when Ariel was watching from the rocks and about to do the well known rock/wave splash scene, the way her hands moved over it was very creepy.  Under the sea was awesome, and Sebastian\u2019s voice grew on me.  Oh an also Flounder\u2026.look how they massacred my boy\u2026but even then, I was ok with him by the end.",

There were multiple Star Wars posters, with one poster (the one that was spread on the internet) where he was minimized and some other characters removed. \n\nI\u2019m not saying people in china aren\u2019t racist, there\u2019s definitely a lot of anti black people there. But it\u2019s crazy how people keep bring up this kind of misinformation every time even though even if it was true that would be Disneys fault. Same with the black panther mask poster even though the language and release dates are different than chinas people still bring it up as chinas posters. And now same with tlm imax posters even though it\u2019s the same as the us one",

China is easily among the most explicitly racist governments I've encountered in all my travels.

I call that simping and for good reason\n\nEdit: dude, when you refer to \"China\", typically that means the State, as in the Government.

And recently it\u2019s the little mermaid imax poster that\u2019s been getting brought up, even though its the complete same as the ww imax poster.\n\nThese things are constantly getting brought up without context and sometimes just straight out false to put not the Chinese government but Chinese people into a single basket.\n\nOnce again fk the ccp.",

I liked that they fleshed out Eric. \n\nWhat I hated: the freaking ending with Ariel driving the boat while standing on her tail. Wtf. Eric was a sailor and it made sense for him to do it because they saved each other in the original and that was what convinced Triton that humans weren\u2019t all bad! The original was about character growth of everyone and a greater story that this one did not capture.",

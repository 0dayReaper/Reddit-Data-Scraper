I liked Chris Gaines quite a lot, and thought his couple singles actually carried more weight than a lot of the other sub-par stuff on VH1 and pop radio.  \n  \n  I think the \"tragic backstory\" thing where Chris was the survivor of a car accident was a little unnecessary.

Something that would get a country artist banned off the fucking face of the country music earth today, much faster than any artists shouting racial slurs. \n\nPeople should remember that country music and the country lifestyle used to be about equal rights, justice, stewardship of the earth and its national resources, and rebellion against authoritarianism. It largely stayed that way until after 9/11, when the United States collectively entered its stupidest era. \n\nAfter that, we had \u201cfreedom fries\u201d and country songs as hilariously stupid \u201c*Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue (The Angry American)*\u201d (which is its actual, real, unironic title), which is just an insult to both intelligence and musical artistry. \n\nBut country artists decided that if you didn\u2019t stand up and salute the American flag, that they\u2019d pee their pants and try to cancel you. Never forget what the country music world did to the Chicks when they indicated that they maybe didn\u2019t support the invasion of Iraq.",

On the day of the Super Bowl NBC network executives told Garth that the song was too controversial and they weren't going to play it. Garth refused to sing unless the video was played and left the stadium. NBC caved and agreed to play the video.",

I\u2019ve seen him perform live once and he cried on and off the whole time hearing the crowd sing his songs back to him. He also played Wild Horses for the first time in 20 years to a little girl who drove for hours hoping he\u2019d play it. I could go on and on about his genuine goodness. I think there\u2019s a documentary on Netflix too if you want more.",

I wasn't really a fan before then, but I was familiar with a couple hits. He totally and absolutely blew me away. Even AFTER my girlfriend had hyped it way up for months leading to the date. \n\nI've been to many concerts of many genres, but the \"buzz\" at that show was unlike anything I have ever experienced. It's like the entire crew goes the extra mile for every facet of the performance. True showmanship at the highest caliber. Everything about it was dialed in *perfectly*. It convinced me enough to become a fan and take the time to devour his entire catalogue, and that's not exactly an easy task when none of it is accessible through my streaming service.\n\nI'm also convinced he may have murdered my grandmother on a desolate stretch of highway in S. Dakota back in the 90's, but the cops couldn't do anything about it because Garth hid her body in a mineshaft :(.",

A few years back he went to his concert in Nashville. During the concert, Garth picked him out of the crowd and motioned for him to come to the front of the stage.  At the end of the show, Garth handed my brother in law his guitar and then invited him backstage for autographs and to meet his wife, Trisha Yearwood.  Dude is just an incredible person.",

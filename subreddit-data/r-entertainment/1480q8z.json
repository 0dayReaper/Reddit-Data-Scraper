            "comment": "Sunday, Disney opened Annecy Annual International Animation Festival with the premiere of its latest animated short\u00a0Once Upon A Studio.\n\nDirected by Dan Abraham and Trent Correy (Once Upon A Snowman), the nine-minute short reportedly brings more than four hundred characters from Disney\u2019s century-long history back to life.\n\nSome who saw the film firsthand at the festival described it as \u201cNight at the Museum\u00a0with Disney characters.\u201d\n\nAn ambitious combination of hand-drawn, CG and live-action characters, the short is said to be a \u201clove letter to the medium, to Disney animation, and really a thank you to anyone in the audience that\u2019s ever connected with a film over the last hundred years,\u201d according to Abraham.\n\nThose characters include Peter Pan, Moana, and even Zootopia\u2019s (or Zootropolis, depending on your location) Flash. But it will also include a voice contribution from the late Robin Williams.\n\nJosh Gad, who will unsurprisingly reprise his role as Disney\u2019s contemporary mascot Olaf, confirmed via his Instagram that Williams\u2019 voice will be heard in the short. The studio seemingly used older recordings to create new dialogue as the Genie from Aladdin.\n\nWhile not confirmed, the short is expected to debut later this year theatrically before\u00a0Wish.",

There is some uncanny valley stuff where the voice sounds similar to, but ultimately different from the source. \n\nKind of like almost any AI generated video will not be photorealistic.",

It's the same circle jerk over the olden times when Disney used to make good, original work that meant something. In these days where all they produce is garbage created by their marketing department that doesn't understand the concept of international sales, or else repurposed properties, it's a joke to call YET ANOTHER Disney feature(ette)full of recycled old characters \"ambitious\".  It's just more of the same crap coming from a studio that no longer values groundbreaking art.",

As a fan who also has so much respect for him, hearing a previously unheard performance of Genie being used here in a love letter to animation could be a very nice thing. Another money grabbing sequel to Aladdin using an AI voiced Genie would be distasteful, but I reserve judgment on this until I see it.",

            "comment": "Sylvester Stallone\u00a0and\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger\u00a0are best known for their action movies from the 80s. As part of the Netflix docuseries\u00a0Arnold, Stallone is recalling his former bitter rivalry with Schwarzenegger and giving him props.\n\n\u201cThe \u201980s was a very interesting time because the definitive \u2018action guy\u2019 had not really been formed yet,\u201d Stallone\u00a0says. \u201cUp until that time, action was a car chase like\u00a0Bullitt\u00a0or\u00a0The French Connection, and a film all about intellect and innuendo and verbal this and verbal that.\u201d\n\nStallone determines that it was with\u00a0First Blood, released in 1982, that action movies changed saying, \u201cYou actually relied upon your body to tell the story. Dialogue was not necessary. I saw that there was an opportunity, \u2019cause no one else was doing this\u2026 except some other guy from Austria, who doesn\u2019t need to say much.\u201d\n\nThe\u00a0Rocky\u00a0star was referring to Schwarzenegger who acknowledged that he was propelled to best himself adding, \u201cEvery time he came out with a movie like\u00a0Rambo II, I had to figure out a way of now outdoing that.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWith films like\u00a0The Terminator\u00a0and\u00a0Commando, Schwarzenegger became Stallone\u2019s rival and \u201cbecame incredibly competitive.\u201d Stallone said they were like Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier \u201cor great warriors that are traveling the same course: There was only room for one of us.\u201d\n\nAlthough they were both action stars, Stallone gives the edge to Schwarzenegger saying, \u201cHe was superior. He just had all the answers. He had the body. He had the strength. That was his character.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to get my ass kicked constantly, whereas Arnold, he never got hurt much,\u201d Stallone added. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going, \u2018Arnold, you could go out and fight a dragon and you\u2019d come back with a Band-Aid.'\u201d\u00a0\n\nSchwarzenegger pointed out that \u201cwithout Stallone, I maybe wouldn\u2019t have been as motivated in the \u201980s to do the kind of movies that I did and to work as hard as I did. I\u2019m a competitive person.\u201d",

He became an actor after being cast by chance in Hercules then told not to continue to which he promptly said \u201cfuck off losers,\u201d and politics probably was a powertrip lets be real. I think he approached these career opportunities as challenges to win and become the greatest by which ever metrics he deemed worthy.\n\nComparing that to Stallone, whose first credits were actually a softcore film, IIRC, is tricky. Yes they were both the quintessential action heroes of the 80s, but given Stallone\u2018s prowess as a writer/Director, this guy seemed more interested in storytelling than being the number one name in the game.",

He knows how to get crowds going, a talent he likely developed during his days in competitive bodybuilding.\n\nStallone doesn't drum up a crowd the way Schwarzenegger does, but I feel like the reason why is because he's a bit more contemplative and reflective.  Which is why I consider him to be a better artist since he can sit down and write a screenplay, or consider all the things a director needs to in order to direct a movie.",

Old days he was stacked that\u2019s no lie and the rest of the \u201cacting world\u201d had some catching up to do in the gym (that part you can\u2019t fake)\n\nLike how at one time it\u2019s really true Hulk Hogan was a serious body. Sure his wrestling was fake but those boa constrictor arms and that 6 foot 7 inch frame was way to real\u2026.\n\nFake wrestlers at the time had to step back because that dude will hurt you and can actually suplex unlike the earlier gen of wrestlers who were really like early days basketball.\n\nIt was still below the ropes and without crazy moves and that\u2019s the same was basketball was when it was the below the rim era (before dunks and 3 pointers when bounce passing was king)\n\nArnold, Hulk Hogan, and yeah the Dunk and 3 point shots came from the 70\u2019s/80\u2019s and changed the game forever.\n\nNo longer could you claim to be an action star without the body to live up to these amazing feats.\n\nNo longer could you be a wrestler if you can\u2019t carry 6\u20195\u201d person upside down on your shoulder (the suplex was king of the 80\u2019s) and if you aren\u2019t 6\u20195\u201d/285 and cut to back up the story\n\nNo longer could you just bounce pass and lay up your way to the title now you have to defend the far line for 3 pointers AND you have to block from dunks.\n\nSo the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s changed the whole board not just the game and yeah if you know how they fake reality TV of todays era that\u2019s basically how they faked the pumping iron film.\n\nStill like I said he had the body to back it up and the votes to win the competition hands down.\n\nAnd the joint he smoked was real too so just like watching some Kim K they sprinkle enough real in with the fake to make it palatable to the audience.\n\nProblem with the Kartrashions was they didn\u2019t get that money from earning it. She sex slaved her daughter after seeing the publicity from Paris Hilton which was an actual stolen and leaked video\u2026\n\nAt least in Arnold\u2019s defense\u2026 He wasn\u2019t the terminator or the governor or even an \u201canybody\u201d yet when they filmed the film. He was just an elite body builder doing his thing (early days reality Tv is how I look at the scene changes from the lens looking back)\n\nSo yep totally agree it\u2019s probably 60% fake drama and the only parts that are real are that he actually DID win and that he actually did smoke a joint.\n\nOh and he moves a small car with his bare hands so.. Dude was never weak or a chump lol\n\nThat\u2019s the essence of what I think Sylvester was really saying was\u2026 Dude was STRONG and you just had to give it to Arnold because he was cut and big and\u2026 yeah the real deal (even if it\u2019s all fake and acting anyway)",

He writes well and knows the genre of action needs things like drama, grief, and suspense to work. \n\nEven though we know that what we are watching is a pure testosterone action movie, Stallone still somehow has the ability to make us care and feel something for characters. \n\nFFS, the villain\u2019s name from Expendables 2 was Vilain\u2026literally villain with one less \u201cL\u201d. Yet, somehow, it still ended up being a totally fun movie and Van Damme made a solid bad guy.",

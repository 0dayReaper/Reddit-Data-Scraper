It\u2019s very much so a female story and they don\u2019t have any sort of sensitivity or decency. What really shocked me is the opening shot of the 1st episode could have been really impactful, but for some reason, I didn\u2019t feel bad for her, and as we continued I really really didn\u2019t feel bad for her. They completely failed to create moments of empathy (I only feel something for her assistant, if anyone)",

The focus was on telling a powerful story with Lily's character being the main focus. Then Weeknd made protests wanting his character to be the center of attention and the og director got fired and was replaced with Levinson,who is notorious for treating female characters as nothing but sexual objects. This turned from a potentially good show to an ego project.",

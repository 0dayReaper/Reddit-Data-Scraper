At once, I experienced this moment of clarity. An epiphany if you will. Sure, I'd been hearing the song all my life. It's not like I didn't know it was great. But for some reason I experienced it more profoundly than I ever had. I was dumbstruck by the idea that humans created something so perfect. And I felt honored and humbled that I got to experience it. I thought of all the countless souls who had lived and died before it was recorded. And I mourned for their loss. I wondered how Tina could still walk the earth like a regular person? As if she had not been living with the burden of having laid down the most blistering, soul stirring, angelic, vocal performance ever recorded.",

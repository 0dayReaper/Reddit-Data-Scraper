That\u2019s how we look at the Indy franchise. I mean, truthfully, right now, **if we were to do anything, it might be in series television down the road, but we\u2019re not doing anything to replace Indiana Jones. This is it.** There are five movies that Harrison Ford did. And Harrison is so specific and so unique to creating this role. We just, Steven [Spielberg] agrees, we just wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nThere won\u2019t be an Indiana Jones 6 or any more stories involving Indy anymore, they might do a Disney+ show set in the same universe. I would be down for an adult Short Round show with Ke Huy Quan back.",

Ezra\u2019s situation came out after filming was finished but before the movie was released. DC didn\u2019t want to scrap a $200 project, so they haven\u2019t publicly done anything about Ezra yet.\n\nMeanwhile Majors accusations came out after Ant-Man but before Loki, which will still feature Majors since it\u2019s finished shooting. Marvel will probably replace him going forward, but they haven\u2019t announced anything yet either.\n\nThe internet wants both of them removed from future projects and I agree. They shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away with any kind of abuse just because they\u2019re famous and the studios needs to do the right thing here.",

People are waaaaay more introverted than they've ever been and many are scared as coming across as a creep. \n\nThere is certainly less tolerance for fuck-ups, so it makes sense why people would be scared to engage.",

A lot of people still find the emotional investment or personal risk too high.",

I was surprised to see that masturbation rates were declining for adolescents too. Here\u2019s the TLDR:\n\n&gt;In addition to finding decreased PVI (penile-vaginal intercourse) frequency in 2018 as compared to 2009, we found significant decreases across all partnered sexual behaviors assessed and, for adolescents, decreases in the proportion of adolescents reporting solo masturbation in the prior year as well. Overall, our findings are consistent with studies from multiple countries that have documented declines in sexual frequency.\n\nI was skeptical that being scared of coming off as a creep was significant, but it was actually mentioned in the discussion as a possibility:\n\n&gt;A number of potentially convergent social and cultural changes may contribute to these substantial shifts in young people\u2019s sexual behaviors. Widespread internet connectivity and emerging new technologies have added a new medium for providing sexual experiences outside of physical sex with a partner (e.g., sexting, easy access to sexually explicit media) (Doring et al., 2017; Twenge et al., 2017; Wright, 2013; Wright et al., 2013). Alcohol use has decreased among adolescents (Miech et al., 2019), and many young people have been engaged in conversations about sexual consent (such as through the #MeToo movement led by Tarana Burke, the Obama/Biden administration\u2019s It\u2019s On Us campaign, and recent high profile rape cases) (e.g., Armstrong &amp; Mahone, 2017; PettyJohn et al., 2019). Also, more contemporary young people identify with non-heterosexual identities\u2014including asexual identities\u2014and more young people identify in gender expansive ways (Newport, 2018; Watson et al., 2020). It is also possible that secular trends reflect a tendency to have over-reported sexual behavior in earlier years, with more accurate reporting now as people become more comfortable with online presentations of themselves.\n\nThere is actually some data that playing video games is a factor too, which Reddit might not want to hear:\n\n&gt; In terms of young adults, some research suggests that increasing use of computer games and social media may be implicated in young adults\u2019 declining sexual activity (Lei &amp; South, 2021). A recent analysis of 18\u201323-year-olds in 2007\u20132017 waves of the Transition to Adulthood Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics found that increased use of computer games, decreased alcohol use, decreased earnings, and declines in romantic relationship formation explained 76% of the decline in sexually active young adults in their sample (Lei &amp; South, 2021).\n\nThis is all for 2018 and prior though, I imagine it has only declined further since the pandemic",

Some people are okay being touchy with you right away if they're attracted to your physical appearance, while another may not find you physically attractive but would be willing to hook up if they get to know you better. No one speaks to the complexity of this matter, we treat dating as if it's this clear game of \"yes\" or \"no\" when that couldn't be further from the truth.",

Our bodies only trauma as black and white; it occurred to us or it didn't. Older generations prefer to think of trauma in levels, \"oh that's only a little trauma,\" but we now know that's not how it works.",

It\u2019s behavior that I would call groping. There should be consequences. But if Im in an office setting and a coworker slaps my ass vs rapes me, Im not using the same term for them. And for one of them, the person\u2019s getting arrested. For the other, for the once incidence, Im not sure I would report it. Id talk to them first. Tell them to keep their fucking hands to themselves. \n\nAlso, one should be defined as a trauma, and Im sorry, but the 2nd should not.",

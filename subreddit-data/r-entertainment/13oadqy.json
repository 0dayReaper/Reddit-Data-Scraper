Of course, you can only see Alien for the first time once and there\u2019s something so unpredictable to the creature at the heart of it, and so disturbing about it, that after 6 movies you think \u201cwell, maybe there\u2019s no mystery left to it.\u201d What\u2019s interesting to me is to try to remystify the franchise. The creature, the story, for a modern audience in the way that my 15-year-old won\u2019t think is slow, is the requirement.\u201d",

Even Scott, in his sequels, seems to be at least partially convinced that his successors had been correct about the need for more noise and hubbub. \n\nNow, hopefully the new film maker can execute this vision.",

I adore Alien, but it is fundamentally a haunted house movie set in space. You aren\u2019t going to pull eight episodes out of that, so it will require an engaging series of plots to stretch it out while keeping some mystery to it. This might be heresy, but as much as I want this to be good I would much rather see an anthology show using the best of the original Dark Horse storylines. I particularly remember the ant one and the royal jelly storylines being good, but it\u2019s been 25 years.",

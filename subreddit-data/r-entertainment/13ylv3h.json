He seems to take out every opportunity to call out Jewish people.  \n\nThere is little separation between the politics of the nation and the ethnic group in his language, whether intentional or not- that's where my problem is.\n\nI mean, putting the star of David on a pig is not exactly kosher and the provocation is intentional. I don't think everyone should be canceled for their miss steps because there's always time to grow but homeboy is pretty long in the tooth and if he's anything like my grandfather, I don't think that's likely to happen.",

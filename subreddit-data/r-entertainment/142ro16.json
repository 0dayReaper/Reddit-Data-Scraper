My personal fave is still Winter Soldier or Infinity War.\n\n\nI came back from an early screening tonight.\n\nIt's not an Oscar masterpiece, but it genuinely *is* a good superhero movie. Ezra Miller is actually a good actor in it.\n\nIt's crazy to me but I had an amazing time watching it. I think it's DC's best film when compared to everything starting from 'Man of Steel' to the present.",

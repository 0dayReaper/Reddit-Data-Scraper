            "comment": "\u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\u201d star\u00a0Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova\u00a0is opening up about the cast and crew\u2019s mental health while shooting the Amazon Prime Video series.\n\nDuring an appearance on this week\u2019s\u00a0\u201cJust for\u00a0Variety\u201d\u00a0podcast, the actor tells me that an on-set therapist was on hand to offer help after the show received racist backlash against its inclusive and diverse casting. \u201cYou need support when this happens because the voices are so loud and they\u2019re coming at you from so many places,\u201d C\u00f3rdova says.\n\nC\u00f3rdova,\u00a0who was shooting Season 2 in the U.K.\u00a0when we spoke, says the therapist\u2019s presence alone was beneficial. \u201cI loved seeing her there, even if we didn\u2019t speak,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew there was someone there seeing me completely. It wasn\u2019t just as an actor.\u201d\n\nThe therapist was brought on board when production resumed shooting after pausing during the pandemic. C\u00f3rdova\u2019s character Arondir is the first person of color to play an elf onscreen in the \u201cLOTR\u201d universe. \u201cIt hurt,\u201d C\u00f3rdova says of the backlash. \u201cIt had a psychological and mental health impact. That\u2019s something that I\u2019m very, very open about so that people understand that what they do and say online really hurts people, really has an impact on us.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just attacks on social media. \u201cMy phone got hacked,\u201d C\u00f3rdova recalls. \u201cI had bank account attempts of being hacked. My PayPal got hacked. My friends got messages. I got death threats. I got things mailed to me. People found out my address. It was a lot of that.\u201d\n\nBut then he says with a big smile, \u201cWe\u2019re still here.\u201d\n\nC\u00f3rdova has also been open about how badly he wanted to be on the show \u2014 so much so that when he wasn\u2019t originally cast, he convinced producers to reconsider. \u201cI grew up with that rejection all around me. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s driven me,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was not going to take a \u2018no\u2019 for an answer because I knew what this role would entail. I knew what it would do in the scope of fantasy. I knew that I wanted to be part of something historic, especially with the elves. The elves have been historically portrayed as white and Aryan. I wanted to be an elf. I was a mountain boy [who grew up in Puerto Rico]. I was in love with nature, and I knew it would change things.\u201d",

This is horrible. \n\nI wonder if being part of Rings of Power is worth the dent to any of the cast\u2019s mental health. People *really* hate this adaptation. Morfydd Clark must cop a fair bit of harassment too.",

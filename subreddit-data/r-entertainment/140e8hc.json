Here's the wiki intro to what Blanket Training is:\n\n\n&gt;Blanket training, also known as 'blanket time,' is a method adapted from the methods encouraged in To Train Up a Child, published in 1994 and written by Christian fundamentalists Michael and Debi Pearl. To Train Up a Child promotes several harsh parenting techniques, with a focus on child obedience, which have been linked to multiple child deaths.\n\n&gt;Blanket training is an allocated amount of time during the day where an infant or toddler is required to remain on a blanket or play mat for a limited period of time, with a few selected toys. **When the child moves to leave the blanket, parents are instructed to hit the child with a flexible ruler, glue stick, or another similar object**. Many of those doing it have voiced online that they start by doing five minutes a day and build up the intervals over time, with some extending it to 30 minutes or more.\n\n&gt;**Proponents of the technique claim that blanket training helps very young children to learn self-control, however, no empirical evidence currently exists to back these claims.**\n\n&gt;[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanket_training)",

Oprah was really digging her fake nails into those girls' trauma and wanted to know exactly how it felt to live with their abuser after his prison sentence and how they felt about their mother taking him back.\n\nI think they had been coached by the mother though, because the most Oprah got out of them was that they didn't like being alone in the same room with him, but otherwise they said they were fine with everything. One word answers all through the interview\n\nThat's the Oprah I remember. I can't believe that person managed to rebrand herself into today's Oprah",

This all happened in 1988-1990. \n\nWhen I was in high school, we got a new pastor at our family church and he introduced IBLP bit by bit. I remember the curriculum with glossy images of the \u201cumbrellas of authority\u201d, and our youth group attended a big conference at the King Dome in Seattle with Gothard as the key note speaker. We had a legit book burning at a youth group barbecue, to get rid of \u201ctemptations\u201d. One kid burned his mother\u2019s JC Penney catalogs because the models caused him to \u201cstumble\u201d. She apologized to him for the transgression of bringing it into their home. \n\nMy parents didn\u2019t buy into it, but they didn\u2019t leave either. When I started dating a guy who went to a different church, the pastor\u2019s wife took me out to lunch - she told me that her son thought highly of me and wanted to court me. I clearly had been selected for breeding stock, but didn\u2019t see it at the time. \n\nI can\u2019t say many nice things about my first marriage, but it did get me out of crazytown.",

How JimBob lied to Jill about the contract (the day before her wedding knowing how busy she would be). Like, I can't even put into words how absolutely sickened i felt.

My heart breaks for the victims of that church and especially the females born into families that follow those teachings. This is all they know.

But the live-action pic adapts the Mojang sandbox video game, which is the highest-selling of all time. It\u2019s scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025.\n\nThe\u00a0Minecraft\u00a0film hails from Vertigo, co-financier Legendary, Mojang/Microsoft and Momoa\u2019s On the Roam. Producers on the project include Roy Lee, Jon Berg, Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Momoa, Torfi Frans Olafsson, Vu Bui and the late Jill Messick. The executive producers are Todd Hallowell, Kayleen Walters, Brian Mendoza and Jonathan Spaihts.\n\nBerry is best known for his BAFTA and Critics\u2019 Choice Award-nominated turn as vampire Laszlo Cravensworth in FX\u2019s hit comedy\u00a0What We Do in the Shadows, which returns for its fifth season on July 13th. Other notable credits for the British actor, comedian and writer include BBC\u2019s\u00a0Great Expectations, as well as Channel 4\u2019s\u00a0Year of the Rabbit\u00a0and\u00a0Toast of London, the latter of which he also co-created.\n\nBerry is repped by CAA, Mgmt Entertainment, and B-Side Management in the UK.",

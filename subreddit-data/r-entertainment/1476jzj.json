They are similar in that both are about pairs of belligerent drunks and feature Ralph Steadman art (though the characters are all very different personalities). Both movies are based on biographical novels from the early 70\u2019s. But in terms of chronology, Where the Buffalo Roam (the first Fear and Loathing movie w/ Bill Murray) was made in 1980 and a Fear and Loathing project was in development since the mid 70\u2019s. Withnail is 1987, and Fear and Loathing Directed by TG is 1998. It\u2019s a snake eating itself. Robinson inspired by WTBR, makes WAI, and then Terry G makes F&amp;L.\n\nHowever, the OP specifically said Fear and Loathing \u201cLifts\u201d all its good parts from Withnail and I, when most of the scenes and dialogue are taken directly from Fear and Loathing the book so I just don\u2019t get that argument at all. It lifts from the source material that predates WAI by almost two decades. \n\nJohnny Depp did want Bruce Robinson to direct it, so you can definitely say his performance is inspired by Withnail. But this thread isn\u2019t about him, it\u2019s about Terry Gilliam who ultimately made a visually stunning movie that looks and feels totally different from WAI.\n\nThat\u2019s my point. That\u2019s why I\u2019m correct. And it hopefully gets you to adjust your strange thinking on the topic.",

I can\u2019t give a pass for someone who made one of the best films I\u2019ve seen in Brazil. He let me down like many artists that inspired me in my youth let me down. \nTo be very specific for those making excuses for Terry, in 46 years of directing, he\u2019s cast one black actor in a supporting role. That\u2019s called a pattern. Don\u2019t at me b/c you saw a few extras named on the credits. He could have kept his contempt for Black Panther to himself but nope, couldn\u2019t help himself. \n\nSo not once I thought. Correction: one guy in the 80\u2019s in 3 films. I wouldn\u2019t have known b/c guys got a mask over his face in Brazil and Time Bandits. I never liked Barron and that\u2019s the one he got screen time on. Don\u2019t remember much of that one at all. Thanks to the person who passed that on or I\u2019d have never known that.",

It turns out that they are innocent, but there is no update news piece of their innocence, and they have a hard time finding jobs and all that. I really don't understand why we don't hold off on naming suspects until they are tried, convicted, and sentenced until their actual name is released. The reverse applies with Jane does. I wouldn't mind if the news says John Smith was accused of blah. Obviously, the actual trial would have the name as the person would be present, but innocent people are falsely accused, and they lose jobs and livelihoods.",

Typically, this figure comes from studies done on college students, an estimated 95 percent of whom do not report their assaults to police. Overall, an estimated 8 to 10 percent of women are thought to report their rapes to the police, which means that \u2014 at the very highest \u2014 we can infer that 90 percent of rapes go unreported, says Belknap. Obviously, only those rapes that are reported in the first place can be considered falsely reported, so that 5 percent figure only applies to 10 percent (at most) of rapes that occur. This puts the actual false allegation figure closer to 0.5 percent.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clearly an imperfect number but ultimately the conclusion is the same regardless: false accusations are extremely, extremely rare.",

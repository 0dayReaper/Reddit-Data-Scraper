The god butcher, Mighty Thor storyline where Jane has cancer, and Thor\u2019s ongoing MCU drama could have been a separate movie from the Guardians and olympians comedy team-up movie.\nI actually cheered when Korg died and thought the movie was finally going to get good.",

Though the Romans did not alter this terminology and also believed their versions of the gods lived on Mount Olympus, to say \u201cOlympians would be Roman gods\u201d is false because it\u2019s actually both, and refers to the Greek gods within the context of Thor: Love and Thunder\n\nSecondly: Thor does not kill Zeus in the film. Though it appears he does, it should\u2019ve seemed strange that Thor could take out the most powerful deity in mythology. In the post credits scene, it is revealed that not only is Zeus alive still, but has put Heracles (or Hercules, as the movie calls him - much to the dismay of every Greek mythology fan) on Thor\u2019s tail to kill him, citing that the mortals have become too careless and unworried by how their actions affect the gods, describing mortals\u2019 reactions to Thor when he falls from the sky.\n\nThirdly: They never visit Mount Olympus, or any place of mythological reverence, for that matter. They go to Omnipotence City, which is essentially a realm for all the gods to coexist in, from all cultures, including non-human.",

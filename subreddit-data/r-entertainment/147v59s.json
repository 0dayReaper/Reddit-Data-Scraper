            "comment": "Sophie Thatcher, one of the breakouts from Showtime sensation\u00a0Yellowjackets, has nabbed the titular role in\u00a0Companion, the sci-fi thriller\u00a0from the team behind last year\u2019s horror hit,\u00a0Barbarian.\n\nThe project has been casting up ahead of a hoped-for summer start of production and has\u00a0Jack Quaid, Lukas Gage, Megan Suri and Harvey Guill\u00e9n\u00a0on the call sheet.\n\nDrew Hancock wrote the original script and is making his directorial debut with the feature, the many plot points of which are being kept hush-hush. It is, however, being described as self-contained, and Thatcher is set to play a character who is more than meets the eye.\n\nThe feature is being produced by\u00a0Zach Cregger, the filmmaker who made the twist-filled, pulse-rushing\u00a0Barbarian, and his\u00a0Barbarian\u00a0companions Raphael Margules and J.D. Lifshitz of BoulderLight Pictures and Roy Lee of Vertigo.\n\nBoulderLight\u2019s Tracy Rosenblum and Vertigo\u2019s Andrew Childs will executive produce.\n\nCompanion\u00a0was won by New Line in a hot horror auction near the beginning of the year. It was initially going to act as BoulderLight and Cregger\u2019s follow-up to\u00a0Barbarian\u00a0before the filmmaker switched tracks to focus on his own script,\u00a0Weapons, also now casting and at New Line. But the team helped\u00a0Companion\u00a0land not just a home but a production greenlight, backing Hancock to make his directorial debut.\u00a0\n\nThatcher is best known for playing teenage Natalie, the younger version of the character portrayed by Juliette Lewis,\u00a0in\u00a0Yellowjackets, Showtime\u2019s acclaimed and popular survival drama. The show, which recently finished airing its second season, became Showtime\u2019s most watched series of the last six years and scored seven Emmy nominations for its first season.\n\nThatcher, who also had a small role in\u00a0The Book of Boba Fett, is currently on screens with 20th Century Studios\u2019 adaptation of\u00a0the Stephen King story,\u00a0The Boogeyman.\n\nShe is repped by CAA, Anonymous Content and Jackoway Austen.",

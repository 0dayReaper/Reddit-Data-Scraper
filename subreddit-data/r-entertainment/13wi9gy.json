I\u2019m of the opinion that most people would do like Kendall, or Roman, and continue to seek more. \n\nWherever you\u2019re at now, you\u2019d be content with more in life, right? Well, that feeling doesn\u2019t disappear. And neither does the feeling of needing to feel productive and/or relevant. People like Tom from MySpace have to make a conscious effort to suppress that greed and make the intelligent financial decision to fuck off and enjoy their stack. \n\nI think Succession is a perfect portrayal of that life. Common folk dream of wealth. The wealthy dream to outclass their peers. The ultra wealthy dream of staying relevant forever. No matter where we\u2019re at in life, what we\u2019ve obtained so far is in the past and looking to the future involves amassing *more*. Nobody has a number they\u2019ll hit and that drive will suddenly disappear. It just doesn\u2019t. Being content and happy takes effort and that effort just isn\u2019t put in by many people. \n\nOn a related note, that contentedness and happiness can be achieved by anyone, with effort. I truly believe that Buddha was right when he said that desire is the root cause of all evil. It\u2019s why I also believe that the dream of most people to grow old with people they love and die peacefully is, on a subconscious level, an acceptance of that fact - we\u2019re aware that with growing old commonly comes a loss of desire for most material things. That loss of desire leads directly to contentedness so long as basic needs are met.",

Plus she didn't want to be like Logan; it's not in her 'public morality' or image to do so, even with how shitty she can be to Tom and just like her dad in how bad she is with interpersonal relationships. She's afraid to open up, yet still seeks those who understand her. Not wanting to be like Logan and opposing his morals and ideals is the main reason she can't 'succeed' him and why no one chooses her, along with how she tried to play both sides and ultimately lost the trust of someone as proud as Lukas (who clearly wants to abuse his power as much as possible, Siobhan is someone he couldn't control like he can with a sycophant like Tom).\n\nKendall was closest to Logan but without any of the competency that Logan and Siobhan had/have. He has 'leadership' skills in that he can make others do his bidding but he lacks the domination of someone like Logan who 'made life happen'. He thought confidence was enough, but had none of the substance Logan could make others create for his goals. Confidence was enough to pull it off sometimes, but Logan always had something more substantial behind his decisions.\n\nRoman has some competency but not the ruthless demeanor, just pretending at it and making slimy friends, and has been spoiled into getting whatever he wants at the cost of a 'real' career and having a guilty conscience. This is why he withered at having to follow-up Ewan's perspective on Logan at the funeral, he might've been able to pull off the lies if Ewan didn't get to tell the terrible truths about Logan and their upbringing first. His inability to stand up to the 'truth' of the protesters was similarly fitting and sent him reeling for the finale.\n\nI think each season drove home the main points on each of the siblings, starting with Kendall then Siobhan then Roman, their failures leading to their respective downfalls, and S3's finale being kinda tossed so S4 could happen the way it did, in that GoJo was wrapped up and ready but suddenly the kids were able to waste time trying to blow up the deal. Season 4 then cemented the flaws in each of the kids, and how they've wilted being overshadowed by their father all their lives.",

I interpreted it as him being out of the fight that we saw nonstop since the first scene of the first season, which was of him. Instead of being inside the chaos and infighting, within the unstoppable force of Waystar (for which the river was a metaphor) he was outside of it and his *new* destiny is unwritten. The river (waystar) presses forward, full steam ahead, even without him\u2026 which also calls back to the \u201cwe are bullshit\u201d from the previous scene. \n\nThe calm was, in a way, him coming to grips with this reality. The end of something he was expecting and living for every day since he was seven, the realization that it goes on just fine without him, and not knowing what the future holds for the first time ever.\n\nWhether he accepts the calm or longs for the crazy would remain to be seen, and that\u2019s up to the viewer to decide for themselves.\n\nHim jumping into the river would have taken away the ability for the viewer to make this interpretation for themselves. Easy, yes\u2026 but I think a bit shallow and less thought-provoking.\n\nRivers are highly symbolic throughout literature, cinema, and music, especially as it relates to existentialism.\n\nI believe the scene was perfect. Simply written, leaning heavily on symbolism, and letting the viewers draw their own conclusions while still providing a feeling of finality.\n\nBecause, in the end\u2026 life goes on.",

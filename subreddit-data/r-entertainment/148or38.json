If they do these movies, they can show the judge when the copyright trial comes up \u201csee ? We made a Bambi just 5 years ago, no need to let it go public\u201d",

            "comment": "After\u00a0winning the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar\u00a0for\u00a0Women Talking,\u00a0Sarah Polley\u00a0is on to the most epic undertaking of her filmmaking career thus far, as Deadline understands that the filmmaker is in talks to helm a live-action take on\u00a0Bambi\u00a0in very early development at\u00a0Disney.\n\nMultiple sources tell Deadline that the project is a musical to feature music from six-time Grammy-winning country star\u00a0Kacey Musgraves.\u00a0Micah Fitzerman-Blue\u00a0and\u00a0Noah Harpster\u00a0(Transparent) wrote the most recent draft of the script, and Chris and Paul Weitz\u2019s Depth of Field will produce.\n\nThe studio first signaled its intention to adapt\u00a0Bambi\u00a0for live-action back in early 2020, bringing Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Lindsey Beer aboard as writers and Depth of Field to produce in January of that year. No word yet on when the project might be put in motion, given unpredictable strike conditions, for starters.\n\nThe film is of course the coming-of-age story of Bambi, the young deer struck by tragedy who counts amongst his woodland pals \u2014 the rabbit Thumper and a skunk named Flower. An adaptation of Felix Salten\u2019s 1923 novel\u00a0Bambi, a Life in the Woods, released by RKO Radio Pictures in 1942, the original\u00a0Bambi\u00a0was just the fifth animated feature ever to emerge from Disney. The film helmed by David Hand and assorted sequence directors grossed over $267M worldwide, landed Academy Award nominations for Best Sound, Song and Original Music Score, and has endured as a classic over the years, assuredly continuing to traumatize young viewers with its famous depiction of the death of Bambi\u2019s mother to this day.\n\nPic was entered into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, given its cultural, historic and aesthetic significance, in December 2011.\n\nPolley\u2019s take on\u00a0Bambi\u00a0will be the latest in a long line of live-action films to adapt Disney\u2019s classic animated features. The most recent installment in this series, which has done huge business fo the studio, is the Rob Marshall-helmed\u00a0The Little Mermaid, which has grossed over $414M since bowing in theaters on May 26th. Polley will certainly be in good company if and when her deal for the project closes, joining a list of directors tapped by Disney for these films that also includes Jon Favreau, Kenneth Branagh, Niki Caro, Guy Ritchie, Tim Burton and Robert Zemeckis, to name only a few.\n\nPolley\u2019s acclaimed ensemble drama\u00a0Women Talking, based on the novel by Miriam Toews, drew on the real 2010 story of a Bolivian Mennonite colony to examine the impossible choice grappled with by the women of an isolated religious community following numerous incidents of sexual assault by the men they thought they knew. Polley directed the film from her script, seeing it released by United Artists Releasing following its fall bow at Telluride. It also earned her Critics\u2019 Choice and WGA Awards, a Golden Globe nomination and other major accolades.\n\nOther directorial credits for Polley include the WGA Award and Cinema Eye Honors Award-winning documentary\u00a0Stories We Tell, examining the family of storytellers of which she\u2019s a part, and the acclaimed dramas\u00a0Take This Waltz\u00a0and\u00a0Away from Her. She began her career as an actor, starting out as a child on films like\u00a0The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\u00a0before going on to star in titles like\u00a0Dawn of the Dead, and is represented by WME, GGA in Canada, Circle of Confusion and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.",

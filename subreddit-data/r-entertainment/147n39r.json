But I think the problem is legitimate debates don't bring in viewers or high ratings. The real core of the problem is that journalism is now all about what attracts the most viewers/readers (and by extension, the most advertising dollars). That and your average viewer is only interested in the most simplistic/extreme of views.\n\nBasically sensationalism and extremism sell, level-headed discourse does not.",

Didn\u2019t the owner and originator of Fox basically respond to Nixon being forced to resign by saying, \u201cNever again,\u201d as in never should a conservative president be made to be accountable?  And wasn\u2019t that his motivation for creating a media empire to foster and entrench conservatism?\n\nETA:  Great username. Weren\u2019t those Eve\u2019s first words to Adam?\n\nEdit:  Roger Ailes, advisor to Richard Nixon, advised Nixon on the importance television plays in influencing people back in the late 1960\u2019s.  Nixon, Ailes, and others in the administration sought to create a television network that would publicly brutalize any who opposed their views.  They were initially unsuccessful, and their progress derailed by Watergate and Nixon\u2019s resignation. \n\nAiles hooked up with Rupert Murdoch in the mid-1980\u2019s as Murdoch expanded his growing media empire into the United States.  Together they launched Fox News in the mid-1990\u2019s, which has become exactly what Ailes and Nixon had dreamed of half a century ago.  It is more likely that Ailes rather than Murdoch said, \u201cNever again,\u201d in response to Nixon\u2019s ousting.  But I can\u2019t find confirmation via my Googling attempts.",

And as much as I am glad that the WGA, DGA, and SAG are gonna get their pay by closing up \"streaming\" as a loophole, that is going to lead to even more shows and movies getting vaulted. Because now you have the cost of storage and streaming coupled with needing to send off checks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd honestly? I wouldn't be bothered by that if there were more physical or even VOD releases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas it last year that Netflix jacked up prices? I was literally about to resubscribe to watch the final season of The Last Knigdom before checking amazon and realizing... it was cheaper to buy blu-rays for the entire series than to get a month of netflix to watch it. And then there is stuff like The Night Comes For Us or Extraction where I love to just put it on when I am in the mood for some mindless ultraviolence but... not 15 bucks a month love it if you catch my drift.\n\nBut if I could buy a blu-ray for that? In a hummingbird's heartbeat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead, I expect this to continue but the goal to be to disney vault everything. Announce that Knives Out is coming back for one month only and watch subscription counts go through the roof.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich all makes it funny that the only dedicated streaming service (so not amazon prime) I have at this point is funimation/crunchyroll but I also buy a LOT of anime blu-rays. Because I am grandfathered in like five years worth of rates ago to the point that my annual renewal rate is comparable to like two months at the current.",

But it could be that the actor liked the project and talked to their contacts to bring them a script and get the ball rolling, they may have been approached just to attach their name or find money, or to promote a project. Obviously a recognizable name is more likely to have been brought in for their name recognition or contacts, but you never really know.\n\nIf someone brought in for their name tries to overextend their involvement I'm sure other producers probably get annoyed - I mean, dealing with actors in general is probably often annoying. However, I think for the most part people in the business 'get it', everyone has a role to play.",

Especially given when you are a kid it heavily is dependent on the director. \n\nLike I hated Dakota Fanning in war of the worlds because she just kept screaming at everything. But the director was the one telling her to do all that. \n\nJennifer knocked it out of the park with her role in winter bones. She was merely 14 years old and took on a dark subject matter very well. And she had a really promising career after that. Winning both serious awards for like for stuff like silver lining playbook as well is silly awards like MTV movie awards for hunger games. \n\nBut as of late it\u2019s like her acting has gotten stale. Or it\u2019s just Hollywood knows women age out super early when compared to men. Maybe she is getting turned down for roles she\u2019s getting older. But I think it\u2019s more so because she has had some bad movies and her acting doesn\u2019t seem to be improving just staying where it was.",

If my boss tried to force me to do sexual stuff to get a promotion, that would be highly immoral and I would report them. If I took up their offer and used it to get ahead of my colleagues and get a promotion, I think that would also say something about my own moral compass.

She was found in New York and that movie was an indie film that do very well. \n\nShe was praised as being an amazing actress at just 14 for her role in that movie that touched on dark subject matter. \n\nSure I guess you could say maybe some later roles where because of Harvey. But her raise to fame might actually be one of the last \u201cpure rises to fame\u201d we see ever again. What I mean by that is acting is out the window. Now roles go to whichever person has the most followers. \n\nCase in point another Louisville native like Jennifer is Jack Harlow. People thought it meant he could act when headlines said he got the role for white man can\u2019t jump after only reading 1 sentence\u2026 \n\nNow actor is so good one sentence will get them the job. It\u2019s because he has 5 million followers. Films and TV has so many mediums they use to reach an audience that now a days having a person with a large social media followed guarantees millions will be aware of the film or show. \n\nHence why Hollywood will never have a Jennifer Lawrence. Some girl doing acting trying to make it and killing it at an audition. Even now we see well named actors talk about how they lost roles to Tiktok stars merely because they have followers (one of the fanning sisters talks of this.).",

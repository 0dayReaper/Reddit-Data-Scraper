            "comment": "John Romita Sr., the revered comic book artist who co-created Marvel characters including Wolverine, the Punisher and Mary Jane Watson, has died. He was 93.\n\nHis death was announced Tuesday night on Twitter by his son, John Romita Jr., a successful comic book artist in his own right.\n\n\u201cI say this with a heavy heart, my father passed away peacefully in his sleep,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe is a legend in the art world, and it would be my honor to follow in his footsteps. Please keep your thoughts and condolences here out of respect for my family. He was the greatest man I ever met.\u201d\n\nOne of five kids, Romita Sr. was born in Brooklyn, the son of a baker. He graduated from the Manhattan School of Industrial Art in 1947, served in the U.S. Army and was working in comics by age 19, getting published in Eastern Color\u2019s\u00a0Famous Funnies.\n\nFor a decade and a half, he split time between the companies that eventually would become Marvel and DC \u2014 Timely Comics and National Comics, respectively \u2014 working on a number of titles and gaining a reputation for his romance comics.\n\nIn 1966, Romita began a five-year run working Marvel editor-in-chief\u00a0Stan Lee\u00a0on\u00a0The Amazing Spider-Man. He took over for artist\u00a0Steve Ditko, who had created the famed webslinger with Lee in 1961 before leaving in a spat with the comic book legend.\n\nRomita\u2019s run on\u00a0Spider-Man\u00a0saw the introduction of a number of the property\u2019s most memorable characters, including Spidey love interest Mary Jane Watson and crime boss Kingpin; it was during Romita\u2019s time as artist that\u00a0Spider-Man\u00a0overtook\u00a0Fantastic Four\u00a0to become Marvel\u2019s top-seller, with the masked man becoming the face of the company.\n\nIn 1972, Romita became Marvel\u2019s unofficial art director, a role that was formalized a year later. He contributed to the design of characters including Luke Cage, the Punisher and Wolverine while training \u201cRomita\u2019s Raiders,\u201d the in-house artists that would correct or replace pages deemed to be unusable, often without credit.\n\nHe served as Marvel art director for more than two decades while also completing artwork for a number of titles, including the cover of 1987\u2019s\u00a0The Amazing Spider-Man Annual\u00a0No. 21, in which Spider-Man alter ego Peter Parker and Mary Jane finally tie the knot.\n\nRomita left Marvel in 1996, going into semi-retirement \u2014 a term that proved meaningless, given his output in the years following, with multiple Spider-Man-related projects for Marvel as well as\u00a0a Superman cover for DC, the first time he had worked for the competition in a half-century.\n\nIn interviews, Romita would often note that he regretted not being born earlier so that he could have been in the first generation of writers and comic book artists. Still, he took pride in building on what others had done.\n\n\u201cNo matter what success I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve always considered myself a guy who can improve on somebody else\u2019s concepts,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0in 2002. \u201cA writer and another artist can create something, and I can make it better.\u201d\n\nRomita also is survived by his wife, Virginia, and another son, Victor.\u00a0",

            "comment": "When I was a kid I would get random comic compilations bought for me by my old man. One of them was a goofy Spider-Man story where he became amnesiac and was convinced by Dr. Octopus that he was his henchman and to work for him. The actual story itself isn't important, just the art. That was the first time I saw Romita Sr.'s work.\n\nI loved Spider-Man as a kid (still do), and Romita was the formative artist for myself, and a lot of other people, mostly the older folk. Just an actual workhorse of a man that put out so much great work over the 50s, 60s and 70s. I don't think people outside of the art industry really appreciate how difficult it is to be a great draftsman that can meet the demanding schedules of something like comic books, and he was an absolute champion at it, and in the process managed to solidify the image of one of the most well-recognised characters and his supporting cast in Western pop culture. People talk about Ditko's legacy a lot, but Romita was the one who came in after and ran with those designs and made them truly pop. RIP.",

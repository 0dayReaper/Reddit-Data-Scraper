            "comment": "Vin Diesel\u00a0says spinoffs of the \u201cFast &amp; Furious\u201d franchise are already in the works, including a female-led installment. \u201cI started developing the female spinoff\u2026 in 2017 with other spinoffs, and the sooner I deliver the finale, the sooner I can launch all the spinoffs,\u201d he told me Saturday at the\u00a0Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP) Block Party.\n\n\u201cFast X\u201d is the first of a two-part ending, but \u201cit\u2019s bittersweet to think of a finale,\u201d Diesel said. In an interview on May 12 at the Rome premiere, he teased that the\u00a0ending might be spread out over three films.\u00a0\u201cLook how many characters and great talent there is in the movie,\u201d Diesel said of the possible 12th film. \u201cThere was no way I can pull that off unless I had everyone on for five seconds. These characters are appealing and we need to see more of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cFast X\u201d features the shocking returns from Gisele (Gal Gadot) and Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). Diesel admits it wasn\u2019t easy keeping the cameos a secret. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to have them back home and even more excited to see fan reactions and to see how happy it makes people.\u201d\n\nEarlier on the carpet, \u201cFast X\u201d co-star Michelle Rodriguez revealed that Gadot had shot cameos for earlier films, but they didn\u2019t make the final cut.\n\n\u201cWe have shot other things a long time ago that might not have fit that specific movie as a finale,\u201d Diesel confirmed. \u201cDoing tags is a very tricky thing because you want your great talent but at the same time you have to be very careful to maintain the emotional state of your audience at the end of the movie. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re juggling.\u201d\n\nRodriguez isn\u2019t sure she\u2019ll sign up for spinoffs. \u201cYou pass the baton on. You take the back seat,\u201d she said. \u201cYou go passenger side. When it comes the next generation, you have to. It\u2019s the only way to let them define the future.\u201d\n\nDiesel and Rodriguez were among the 350 guests at the CTAOP benefit who helped raise more than $900,000 for the organization\u2019s work supporting the health, education and safety of youth in Southern Africa. The evening included a performance by drag queens Luxx and Salina EsTitties. Unfortunately, Theron had to bail at the last minute after testing positive for COVID.",

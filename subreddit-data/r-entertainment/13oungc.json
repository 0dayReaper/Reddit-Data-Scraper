It is *not* an average.  It has never been an average.  All it means is that 77% of reviewers think that the film was at least decent.  Nothing more.  It does **not** equate to a 7.7 out of 10.\n\nIf 3 reviewers think that something is a 10 out of 10, and 1 reviewer thinks that it's a 6 out of 10, that's a 75% score on Rotten Tomatoes even though the average is 9.\n\nLikewise, if everyone agrees that something is merely a 7 out of 10, but that agreement is universal, the Rotten Tomato score would be 100%.",

Go back and read the contemporary reviews- much more positive.",

Being the 3rd-worst of one of the best trilogies ever made isn't necessarily a black mark.\n\nIt's flawed in a lot of ways,  but has a lot of great things as well.  Of the original trilogy it's maybe the most personally affecting story.  Early in the film he has his treasure, he *has it*, but the cries of children in the mines force him to turn back.\n\nThe other films deal largely with preventing some evil person or organization from acquiring an object of power.  Indy's acts save people in a more abstract way by preventing some future malice, but Temple of Doom is the only one of those first four movies where Indy addresses a current injustice by saving people in an immediate way.\n\nI think that makes it special, and endearing.",

Brendan Frasier in that movie, personality-wise, is probably the closest thing we've had to Indy since Crusade.  Yeah he's dumb gun guy and the lady is smart archaeologist, but it's the attitude that matters.  They just split Indy into 2 characters, action Indy and booksmart Indy.  \n\nYou're right, we definitely need more of these, they're too damn fun.  \n\nI think I'd rather see more movies made in the genre rather than recasting Indy, but hey, if they did a good job and made a good movie, no complaints here.",

I feel like Indiana Jones was the perfect mix of casting, directing, the 40s setting, etc, and I don\u2019t really see Indy as a character that needs to be constantly revamped/recast. He\u2019s not a comic book character or a book character with tons of source material to mine, I think it\u2019s fine for things to be finite sometimes. \n\nLike the older Indy sequels don\u2019t really work because you\u2019re missing the elements that made the OG series work, Nazi\u2019s, 40 year old Harrison Ford in his prime, and 80s style filmmaking. \n\nJust recasting and doing endless 40s era stories wouldn\u2019t work either IMO because then eventually you lose Spielberg and Harrison Ford in his prime. \n\nIt\u2019s like the triad of economics \u201ccheap, quality and speed\u201d in terms of a product. For a good indy movie you need \u201cSpielberg, Nazis and Young Harrison Ford\u201d, if you keep making movies you\u2019ll lose one or more of those.\n\nI do agree about adventure movies though. I was hoping the Uncharted movie would work out better than it did because those games/stories are really fun and scratch that itch for an Indiana Jones type story but it\u2019s still it\u2019s own character.",

Indy being erased from history and Phoebe going through all the adventures from the past films.!&lt;\n\nI grew up with Indiana Jones, I watched all the movies as a kid with my dad, so if this is true I would be pretty heart broken.",

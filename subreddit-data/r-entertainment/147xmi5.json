He strong-armed the NFL into playing his 'We Shall Be Free' music video when they wanted him to sing the national anthem at the 93 Superbowl. They told him they would, then said it was 'too controversial', he said \"Okay then, I'm gonna leave\" so they played it. When this 'boycott' came up, I watched it again and cried my eyes out. He's done a ton of benefit concerts. Always been a champion for love and acceptance.",

You know Willie Nelson the internationally famous pot smoking pretty much a hippy who happens to play country music, you know the one who supports LGBT people and did a cover of \u201cSometimes Cowboys Are Secretly Fond of Each Other\u201d that Willie Nelson, you know the one who has openly welcomed immigrants and despised Trump\u2019s family separation policy, he smoked weed with Jimmy Carter\u2019s son on top of The White House that guy. Yeah they were quite surprised that this guy was liberal. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t even listen to his music, there has never been an ounce of hatred to his work. He sings primarily about love, loving each other, his life, cowboys, and other classic country music archetypes like road life, depression, and excessive drinking.\n\nIt never occurred to them that a lot of the things that Willie likes to strum and sing about are antithetical to the Republican cause. And they never cared to think what Republican policies would even appeal to Willie. If he was another Joe Schmo he would\u2019ve been incarcerated long ago by them for smoking weed, if they had it their way a lot of his friends would be forcefully sent to camps for conversion therapy or worse, and everyone knows what a charmer breaking up illegal immigrant\u2019s families is to a guy who just wants everybody to love each other.",

He recorded \"Cowboys Are Secretly, Frequently Fond of Each Other\" right around the same time as a single and later released it on one of his albums. That song has been kicking around Austin since the early '80s. The writer said he lived next door to a gay country bar in Manhattan.\n\nThis was when the whole *Urban Cowboy* thing happened and country music was \"cool\" for a little while. What was particularly in was \"country comes to the big city\" aesthetic. Gay culture at the time used a lot of cowboy imagery, a la the cowboy in the Village People.\n\nWhile it's nowhere near as (pardon the pun) out as it is today, there is a history of LGBT in country music. There are rumors of different stars from different times but nothing worth repeating. In the '80s, there was a group called Doug Stevens &amp; The Outband. He grew up in Mississippi and wrote about, well, growing up in Mississippi and being gay. I'm from Mississippi - we were born in the same town - and he probably grew up in the '70s, and I can just imagine how bad it was.\n\nHe recorded 10 songs in the early '90s while living with HIV in Manhattan. The tracks were released as *Out In The Country* and it was a critical favorite if rather obscure beyond hardcore music freaks. And this was at a time when country music was still unhip and \"alt country\" was just coming together, so the circle was small. It got some national press for a while, too.\n\nI remember hearing some of it, but I couldn't tell you much beyond it reminded me of the band Exile. Country rock but with a softish edge but not quite as soft as, say, the Eagles. Or Exile, for that matter. The band released another album in 1995, *When Love Is Right*. It featured some songs from the band's lesbian bass player. Again, it turned critics on but no one else really got the chance.\n\nThe band's Facebook page said it lasted until 2004, so beyond that I don't know. Their records can be found on Amazon (or Discogs if you prefer that) but they look to be at least twenty bucks. Thanks to streaming services, buying actual CDs is a pricey venture.\n\nAnd I imagine k.d. lang is a no-brainer, but I want to bring her up because her first two records with the Reclines are kick-ass examples of how good country music was in the late '80s. They are, as the kids today say, banger.",

Topics covered in this social commentary include: world hunger, freedom of speech, homelessness, homophobia, racism, and freedom of religion.\u201d According to Billboard: \u201cThe rock star's half-sister was lesbian country singer Betsy Smittle, an outspoken LGBTQ+ advocate who passed away due to cancer in 2013. In 1992, Smittle collaborated with Brooks on his civil rights anthem \u201cWe Shall Be Free,\u201d a social commentary on ridding the earth of worldly despotism.\u201d \n\nIf you are pissed at Garth Brooks now, go pound sand. You are about 30 years too late, loser. Watch him continue to sell out stadiums.",

Yet they're attempting to cancel this guy, not for being trans, not for having an opinion on trans issues, not for supporting a trans person. He's getting boycotted because he performs... at a venue... That serves beer... And the beer formerly, once, paid for an ad... And that ad which has been paid for and the campaign is over, featured a trans person. And there's no forcing of patrons of his show to buy that specific beer. \n\n\nHow many degrees of separation is this man away from supporting a political cause at this point? Four? Five? If they extended that threshold for a boycott to other businesses, conservatives literally wouldn't be able to buy anything ever again",

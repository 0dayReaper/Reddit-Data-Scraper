At first I don\u2019t understand what she is doing, then I realise that she can sense anyone who tries to snap a photograph of her. \u2018Someone was taking a picture of me out of their car,\u2019 she explains. \u2018And look,\u2019 she says, pointing upwards, \u2018there\u2019s a drone.\u2019\n\nNot, she adds hastily, that it is stalking her. \u2018They don\u2019t care about me, thank God.\u2019 We are in the celebrity hotspot of Brentwood Country Mart (LA\u2019s hilarious take on a rural market, with\u00a0high-end shops such as Goop), which attracts the likes of Ben Affleck and Reese Witherspoon. The paparazzi are always hovering, waiting to catch somebody. \u2018If you park in the parking lot, you\u2019re trapped,\u2019 says Davis. \u2018So I parked on the street.\u2019\n\nEven dressed down in a grey sweater and faded jeans, Davis is instantly recognisable as her ditsy on-screen alter ego, Charlotte York Goldenblatt \u2013 one of the famed quartet from Sex and the City, the landmark show that metamorphosed into And Just Like That\u2026, which is about to return for a second series.\n\nA quarter of a century has passed since Sex and the City first aired in 1998. Based on the newspaper columns of Candace Bushnell, it ran for 94 episodes before wrapping in 2004. \u2018People forget how shocking it was,\u2019 says Davis. \u2018Four women over the age of 30 starring in a show where men are secondary and we\u2019re talking about relationships and sex openly.\u2019\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Read more:*** \n\n[***https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2023/06/09/kristin-davis-interview-and-just-like-that/***](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2023/06/09/kristin-davis-interview-and-just-like-that/)",

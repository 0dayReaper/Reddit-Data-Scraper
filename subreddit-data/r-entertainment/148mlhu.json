Pirating is as easy as it\u2019s ever been and you can even find a large number of sites which you can stream pirated content from.\n\nEven the stock going back to where it was shows it was a significant objective net loss.

There\u2019s a reason the stock price is increasing and it has nothing to do with what the company is currently doing; it\u2019s based on presumed increased subscriptions and likely implementation of ad tiers. Everything we have enjoyed about Netflix has been broken by the stock market and the drive to make investors money off of it. At some point, businesses should just be happy making buttloads of money while providing their goods and services rather than finding ways to drive the stock price higher while reducing value to their customers.",

Which would result in people who are the ones who would cancel haven\u2019t being affected yet.  Further there is obviously a manipulation of figures here to make investors believe that it\u2019s actually a very good thing. Will it hit? Sure, but they won\u2019t publicize that.

Because they can just stop accepting withdrawals without, ya know, charging broke people money they don't have.",

It will be interesting to see how this evolves, especially if other streamers start cracking down and we see which streaming services people actually want. It was fun for a while but it seems like streaming is well on its way to being cable tv attached to a tivo, aside from the cable tv packages you can buy through streaming services.",

The question is are people gonna keep they\u2019re expensive packages/pay for ad free or no? HBO gets away with it because of having premium content. Is Netflix gonna continue with premium content or are they gonna cut very good show after 2 seasons? \n\nOnce again Wall Street looking short term, not long term\u2026",

Told my family member I wasn\u2019t able to use it so don\u2019t keep the service because of me. He said he wasn\u2019t watching and only keeping it because of the family members who were able to use the account so he canceled. \n\nIn the meantime I\u2019ve been exploring other streaming services instead of just \u201cturning on netflix\u201d because I have access to it. I\u2019ve found some shows I never would have checked out if I still had access to my family members netflix account. I highly recommend \u201cThe After Party\u201d on Apple TV Plus. I imagine there are others with stories similar to mine, where even if the primary account holder is still paying for the service, you now have a large amount of people asking \u201cdo I actually need Netflix if I have to pay for it? Maybe I\u2019ll check out their competitor.\u201d\n\nSeriously get Apple TV Plus and watch The After Party.",

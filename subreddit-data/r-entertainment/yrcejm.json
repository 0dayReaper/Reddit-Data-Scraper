This bill would make it impossible for people to perform on-stage by using broad encompassing criteria and nothing about this is acceptable. The language of this bill would put trans people in trouble when participating in a  public event and that is absolutely on purpose.\n\nThere is nothing inherently \"sexual\" about drag and the push to classify it as such is a blatant move towards complete disallowment of and hatred towards this form of artistic expression, as well as contributing to the hateful and dangerous canard of \"visibly existing LGTBQ+ people is child abuse\".\n\nThis proposed bill is part and parcel of the \"transgender panic\" where a vulnerable minority is scapegoated and used as a political tool by the extreme-right to cause manufactured outrage and violence.  Hate doesn't ever stop once it has been normalised and made mainstream to hate a targeted minority. It just moves on to the next group of people.\n\nPlease help the mod team by reporting all comments that agree with this bigotry, all comments that justify this bigotry.  Reporting helps us locate rulebreakers faster and ensures a safer, more pleasant community for everyone since we will be able to remove bigots from it.",

The party of freedom.\n\nPeople just out there living their fucking lives and doing what makes them happy, of harm to NO ONE, and Republicans SCREEEEEEEE in with a bill to make it A FUCKING FELONY. \n\nFor a man to wear women's clothes and sing songs.  That's a felony to them.  They want to send you to serious jail for an extended period of time and take away your ability to vote in future elections *because a man put on a dress and sang show tunes*.  Just let the batfuck insanity of that set in.  That's the Republican party.\n\nFuck.  Those.  People.\n\nThey claim its to protect children, despite the fact they *literally sent child-fucker Matt Gaetz back to the federal government*.  We have receipts he paid a child to fuck him and they sent him to government. \n\nAnd they want to send men in drag to jail.\n\nDo you know what drag queens have never done?  Started a war with a nation of brown people.  Roved around in bands lynching black men or similar marginalized groups.  Strap AK-47s to their chests and storm a library to intimidate librarians who catalog books that mention that gay people exist.\n\nDo you know what drag queens do tend to do?  Vote Democrat.\n\nThe Republican party is entirely and completely fucking delusional and they thrash and flail and hurt everyone around them in their deleriousness.  \n\nJust remember if you feel like skipping elections in 2024, or 2026; these are the people who gain power through your apathy.  Don't let them.  They don't deserve a single fucking elected office.  It doesn't matter what office they hold.  They are irrational, fueled by the greatest weaponized propaganda network mankind ever created, and they will fuck up your life and the lives of anyone just out there living their life because they're bitter, hateful, delusional fascists and that's what they *do*. \n\nNever stop voting them into oblivion.  Ever.  I don't care how certain the vote looks, I don't care how confident or hopeless you are.  \n\nYou have a duty to everyone in this nation to make sure the miserable hateful fucks who pass this sort of legislation never hold a single public office.  That's a lifetime duty.  Take it seriously.  Enact it.  Because you can be assured they're taking it seriously.  \n\nAnd you can be assured that while this is just tennessee and likely won't pass, just look at what they do the *moment* they have power in restricting abortion, and coming after gay marriage and every other decent thing they can think of. \n\nThey will never stop.  So you better not either.",

Most perform in clubs where one needs to be 18+ or 21+ to enter.  Drag Queens who read children's books to children at libraries are not cracking the same jokes or performing the same show they would for adults in clubs.  They're simply entertaining kids.  Republicans are completely out of touch with reality.  This is why their so called Red Wave trickled into non-existence in the recent elections.  People are sick of their whackadoodle theories and conspiracies and tired of having their rights cancelled by people who would rather you lived by their rules instead.",

            "comment": "Holt McCallany\u00a0(Nightmare Alley) and\u00a0Julianne Nicholson\u00a0(Blonde) are the newest additions to the cast of\u00a0Amateur, the CIA thriller that\u00a0Rami Malek\u00a0is leading for\u00a020th Century Studios.\n\nThe actors join an ensemble that will also include Rachel Brosnahan, Caitr\u00edona Balfe, Laurence Fishburne and Adrian Martinez, as previously announced.\n\nBased on the 2014 Blacklist script\u00a0The Defection, which was itself based on the Robert Littell novel\u00a0The Defection of AJ Lewinter,\u00a0Amateur\u00a0tells the story of Charles Heller (Malek), a CIA cryptographer who, after his wife is tragically killed in a London terrorist attack, demands his bosses go after them. When it becomes clear they won\u2019t act due to conflicting internal priorities, he blackmails the agency into training him and letting him go after them himself.\n\nThe film to be directed by\u00a0Slow Horses\u2018 James Hawes had its screenplay adapted by Ken Nolan, with Scott Frank and Gary Spinelli handling revisions.\n\nWhile sources tell Deadline that McCallany will play CIA Deputy Director Moore, a \u201ckill whoever we want\u201d kind of guy who has spent his career behind a desk, details as to Nicholson\u2019s role haven\u2019t been disclosed. Hutch Parker and Dan Wilson are producing, with Malek serving as the film\u2019s executive producer.\n\nGenerating much acclaim with his turn as FBI agent Bill Tench on Netflix\u2019s\u00a0Mindhunter, McCallany more recently appeared on the TV side in\u00a061st Street, the legal drama that has moved from AMC to The CW for its second season. The actor recently appearing on the film side in Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Oscar-nominated\u00a0Nightmare Alley\u00a0will next be seen starring opposite Zac Efron, Harris Dickinson, Jeremy Allen White and Lily James in Sean Durkin\u2019s buzzy wrestling drama\u00a0Iron Claw\u00a0for A24, and will also appear in the forthcoming\u00a0Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\nA recent Emmy winner for her turn opposite Kate Winslet in the acclaimed HBO miniseries\u00a0Mare of Easttown, Nicholson has also been seen of late on such much-discussed series as\u00a0The Outsider\u00a0and\u00a0Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty. She played the mother of Ana de Armas\u2019 Marilyn Monroe in Netflix\u2019s\u00a0Blonde\u00a0and was also recently seen in Roku\u2019s\u00a0Weird: The Al Yankovic Story. The actress is next set to star opposite Nicolas Cage in A24\u2019s\u00a0Dream Scenario.",

Daneel Olivaw for novel readers).\n\nThe other half of the show that takes place on Terminus is terrible, like something out of Syfy show.",

Although the prose can feel dated the format of the books was really cool and to this day feels unique and grand. \n\nI think the show was great but the Terminus half quickly drifted away and stopped feeling like the books completely.",

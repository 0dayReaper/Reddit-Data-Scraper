He\u2019s tried to kickstart social media drama with like the last three or four DC heads including James Gunn who hasn\u2019t even made anything yet.\n\nIf they had an icon for him, 1000% chance that Ray Fisher would post how it was pathetic of WB to do and that they should be ashamed of using his face to market still.\n\nDude loves to shame WB for things done by chanting \u201caccountability over entertainment\u201d but hasn\u2019t had a fucking peep to say about Ezra Miller. Miss me with that shit.",

I'm not going to say the worst, but Snyder was certainly tone deaf to what makes these heroes and their stories important to audiences.",

The same is definitely true for Battinson's as well since I've seen people try to knock his Bruce, too. Guy barely had any scenes as Brucs, and when he did, he managed to understandably still be in Batman mode. \n\nThere's that too. It's probably easier to judge Irons's Alfred who had that really deep Alfred sarcasm that I know and love.",

Adam West being the king of it, and Joel Schumacher putting the nail in the camp coffin after Batman &amp; Robin.  \n  \n  Even Burton's Batman was incredibly camp, but because it sits in between West and Schumacher's versions, you ignore how ridiculous aspects of it can be.  \n  \n  I wonder what that says about the world, that we prefer our Batman stories to be less fun, and more tormented. More grit and grime, less color.  \n  \n  But yeah, in arguably, Nolan's franchise had the strongest understanding of how to tell compelling Batman stories and Bale was the best version of both Bruce and Bats.",

There's a lot to acting beyond saying your lines and he got the physical aspect nailed down. Keaton and Bale for example looked more scrappy than imposing. Pattinson is a twig. Batfleck looked the part. Batman should be bulky and overpower regular thugs. Of course, this is a matter of taste, but his take was very close to the Batman I saw as a kid in comics.\n\nSure, there could be better actors that can get bulky. Let's get them on screen. Pattinson was fine but his Bats was an emokid basically. If he bulks up he might be good, but I doubt he will, they are going for a different take on the character.",

To this day he hasn\u2019t said exactly what Joss did on the justice League set. \n\nHe said Toby emmerich was wanting to change his skin colour even tho he was just editing the colour grade of the movie. Toby later apologized but ray kept at it with him.\n\nHe got mad at Geoff johns for threatening his career. Geoff said if he went after joss he wouldn\u2019t have a career anymore. He went after Hamada for \u201c interfering in the investigation\u201d without actually saying what that means. Plus a bunch of other people.\n\nLike some of his issues actually make sense. But others like Toby, Sarnoff and Hamada he hardly actually explains what the issue is with them and what they did.\n\nHe also went after the investigator he hand picked for the investigation. He had full confidence in her before the investigation. Until it found no evidence of Hamada interfering. Then he was like she was paid off by Warner brothers. \n\nHe even asked Andy to make sure Hamada wasn\u2019t involved in the flash, if andy wanted ray to be in it. He literally asked a dc film director to choose him or the head of dc films. Then got mad when he chose the head of dc films\n\nBut he worked with amber heard who abused Johnny depp. Worked with Ezra Miller who literally assaulted multiple people and groomed a little girl. Still worked with Ben after he groped a woman on live television. And still worked with Leto even with all the rumours about him. \n\nHe also went after Ann Sarnoff even tho she and Toby are the main reasons the snyder cut was even released.",

That\u2019s like making Hawkeye the central character of The Avengers, so I can see why Whedon and WB execs wanted to make changes when they could. \n\nThe whole series was poorly conceived and implemented by not having origin films before the team-up and trying to skip to the biggest big bad in Darkseid and his cronies right away when you could have made a perfectly fine film with Brainiac or the Legion of Doom to start as the first outing for the team.",

I also despise Joss Whedon and what he became.\n\nI am sympathetic to what happened to Fisher, but how he reacted to it was mind-boggling. He was picked from obscurity to play Cyborg. He thought he was set to be a star. But he killed all chance of that by acting so erratic in social media. He was right to be angry, but he should have understood that burning all bridges towards the studio would make him close to unemployable to other studios unless a director such as Snyder goes to bat for him. No studio making a big blockbuster film wants him to blow up on Twitter if something bad happens on set. There are many actors who can do what Fisher does and still act professionally if something happens.\n\nHe's a story of \"when keeping it real goes wrong\".",

And then there\u2019s other studios who also employ great creatives that aren\u2019t abusive, but he\u2019s vocal to this day in trashing an entire studio, what makes you think they would want anything to do with someone so volatile?\n\nAnd while his behavior reflects abuse, it doesn\u2019t give him a free pass. He should be in therapy working this out and not on social media deteriorating his mental health and career with every work posted.\n\nI know it\u2019s also shit that the general consensus is Ezra Miller is suffering zero backlash and is still employed. I hate that.

I'm sure many stars refuse to work with people or studios they've had bad experiencs with. But he made it a point to make it as public as possible. He could have just put out a statement and take the high road.  He chose otherwise and now studios don't want anything to do with him. That's on him. It's understandable that he was not equipped to handle it professionally. It was after hall his first major role in a major film. But it's still on him how he chooses to go about getting justice and he chose poorly.\n\nIf you get fired, do you go on LinledIn and bash the company for weeks afterwards and pick fights with anyone who has anything to do with that company? How would that make your LinkedIn profile look? Quite bad, right? Same thing here, except for actors and other celebs Twitter, TikTok and Instagram are their LinkedIn. Studios want more than a guy acting. They want someone who will do marketing and make the film and the studio look good. They can't be sure whether Ray Fisher would blow up on Twitter or not, so they pass on him for any big roles. He's easily replaceable anyways.",

It wasn\u2019t his decision. Fisher was asked about what Whedon had done that was racist and he completely backtracked and said it was the producers who were racist. Read any of the Hollywood trades\u2019 coverage of the stories. Everything Fisher accused Whedon of he ended up backtracking or it was someone else\u2019s beef with Whedon that had appropriated for attention.\n\nAlso, what specifically about saying the characters\u2019 known catch-phrase is racist? Why sign up to play a character if you don\u2019t want to say their famous catch-phrase? Is it okay to play a Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtle and refuse to say, \u201ccowabunga, dude?\u201d Is that what a professional actor would do?",

I was tempted to say this was mad petty from WB, but I doubt he wants to be associated in any way with it at this point. \n\nPeople say they're annoyed that he keeps bringing this stuff up, but I think of it like a really bad wound that is taking a ton of  time to heal and because of how it was received, that anger is still really raw and fresh. It's going to take much longer than 6 years for it to go away. I hope he's got a good support system around him.",

Plus the fact that he just cannot let it go. Like dude. You got fired. You rightfully went after them. All the individuals from WB that impacted you are essentially gone or no longer holding significant power. Let it go at this point. \n\nPlus, his refusal or silence on Ezra Miller speaks a lot. For a man who constantly preaches Accountability &gt; Entertainment, he sure seems to stay silent on the Accountability for his former fellow Justice Leaguer. \n\nKhary Payton is best Cyborg.",

A man that loves his craft and is able to, with no ego, acknowledge how great some of his peers are. And I 100% agree with him. A few are the greatest actors of my generation and two of them are on pace to be the greatest actors of the next. \n\nDriver is just a fucking beast. I got stuck watching that shit show Girls with my wife, but Driver was magnetic. I knew he was going to go places. He carried that shit. Just hearing him in interviews is amazing. His passion really shows. Edgerton has the chops to go far, a great actor, singer, dancer, triple threat type of guy. I'm really interested in what he has in store. \n\nDiCaprio and Bale, I will watch anything they put out there. Period. Same with Phoenix. He's never not interesting to watch.",

He said as a kid he dove into acting in that film and didn't really realize at the time what a great opportunity he had to be in such a big production at a young age. They had huge sets built up, hundreds of extras on set, even flew to China to film , et.c. It was only when he grew older and worked on other smaller film's that he looked back and thought \"hey, that was a big one.\" He said he appreciates that he didn't know how huge the film was/gonna be when he was making it; less pressure and he really got to enjoy himself doing what he loved.",

Twists on twists on twists on twists and over the top acting and over the top dialog to ice an over the top story... love it.

And in that theatre, in the final scenes of the film, the entire audience gasped several times and I remember describing the moments as \"then I said What the fuck? and then What the fuck?! and then What the FUCK?! and then HOLY SHIT!\". The ending is an adrenaline shot.\n\nI saw the film in theatres again earlier this year or last for its 15th anniversary (damn). And it was so good, I don't want to watch it again for at least half a decade.",

Like he's a really good actor, and he has a great screen presence.. but I always have \"there's Leo acting\" in the back of my mind lol. \n\n\nUnlike Bale who can pretty much disappear in a role. Like 'The Fighter', etc. I don't get the same \"ah. It's Bale acting\" lol. I just see the character when he gets a great role.\n\nNormally I wouldn't like an actor that I can always see, and feel that they're acting, but like I said... something about Leo allows me to look past that. He picks amazing films and roles, and he has an awesome screen presence in those films.",

A movie star builds on their cache of previous roles, charisma, looks, energy, etc. They are dynamic on screen but they\u2019re always THEM, which is why you are drawn to them if you already like them. Clooney can be the narcissistic dolt in O Brother, or the suave Danny Ocean, and he gives great performances in both but he\u2019s still Clooney. Someone like Bale, conversely, can sometimes have that star quality, but can also disappear into roles to the point you forget it\u2019s him.",

                                    "comment": "All great actors, just with different focuses. Bale couldn't carry a movie with charisma like Leo, and Leo couldn't disappear as well as Bale into a role. This is very simplified, but as I see it, great actors fall into two categories. One type makes the character believable, the other focuses on making the story believable. \n\nBale, DDL, and Oldman would be the first type. They can blend into the role, you lose sight of the actor, and you see the character. They could be in a terrible movie and still shine. They may not look, sound, or act like themselves in any recognizable way, but they are entirely the character. They take on affectations with a focus on their own character, and their interaction with their environment. Other characters work with this easily because it's easier to act off someone else when it seems real. But if the other actors aren't up to par, it'll be another movie where our type 1 actor shines, but they're the only good thing about it.\n\nDiCaprio and Tom Hanks fall into the second category. They aren't typically going to be in a bad movie, because they focus on making the entire story and other characters shine. You see the actor, but you don't care because they're good at what they do. It's not like Samuel L Jackson or Pauly Shore, where they're always the same. They have true emotion, nuance, and they take on various affectations. You believe them. But they do it in a way that's based on interaction with the other characters.  Because of this, their movies are nearly always good, they elevate the actors around them, and people go see the movie *because* it's a Leo or Hanks movie. They know it's going to be solid, even though it's clearly Leo or Hanks playing a new role.\n\nThe best of the best is when the two types of actors work together. When great actors of type 1 and 2 combine, you get great works like Gangs of New York. Perfect example. DDL made himself unforgettable in that movie. He brought the drama and character that Leo then used to drive the plot. The type 1 builds the foundation, and the type 2 turns it into a story that connects with the other characters using their charisma.",

There\u2019s a mood and a time for every single one, and I do have a firm belief that every single kind of film can be done brilliantly.\n\nHe also added in the interview that he took his son to watch Thor: Ragnorak, and stayed to watch it until the credits because he ended up loving it so much despite his son wanting to leave already (as most kids that age do).",

He has an intense face with intense expressions. Whereas Leo has a softer face and can go into an easier going, tension reducing form much smoother. In Django Unchained he has a very casual easy draw to him and then flirts into being intense for a while. I think Bales version would be just a little more intense at the characters loosest parts, and with the tension already in that movie it may change the way the whole movie feels to a degree. Also a weird hypothetical and I have no idea what I am talking about. Cheers",

Leo can definitely play unhinged, hyper-driven, revenge-fuelled or suave. Personally, I believe he has all the tools to play a great Batman/Bruce Wayne.\n\nBale might be the better overall actor but Leo is an excellent actor too. You give a good actor a good script and character and it usually turns out pretty good. I think Rob Pattinson (The Batman), Heath Ledger (Joker) and Daniel Craig (James Bond) are very good examples of that.",

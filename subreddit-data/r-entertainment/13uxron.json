I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll do some bomb stuff with it later. But if I don\u2019t happen to see this movie in full 3D with a big big screen and the best audio I can find near me, I\u2019m probably not gonna see it at all.",

The \u201cClassic Pixar\u201d era (1995-2010) was perfect. There was not a single lackluster film during those 15 years. 2011 ceased the era with their first rotten film, \u201cCars 2.\u201d 2012\u2019s \u201cBrave\u201d was only okay. Throughout the decade, we had a mix of \u201ceh\u201d and good movies. Starting in 2020, they\u2019re playing a bit too safe and are getting harder and harder to distinguish from other animation studios. That\u2019s just my analysis on the matter. I\u2019ll still see \u201cElemental\u201d mainly because it looks charming and the score was composed by Thomas Newman (known for works like \u201cWall-E\u201d and \u201cSkyfall\u201d)",

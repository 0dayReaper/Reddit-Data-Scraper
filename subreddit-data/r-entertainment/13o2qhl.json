You personally may not have been invested in any of the many projects he cancelled, and that\u2019s perfectly fine, but a ton of passionate fanbases were hence the negative attitude toward him as a result.\n\nThe other significant factor in why people are really pissed at him is he has removed a lot of content from HBO Max, much of it being animation, that prevents those who worked on those projects from receiving anymore residuals from the shows and movies they worked so hard on which was income they very much depended on. Many of which are now no longer viewable without piracy at this point. \n\nThe final main reason, and admittedly a more politically divisive one, is that he is shifting CNN\u2019s news coverage to be more \u201cboth sides\u201d and lean more moderately conservative. This obviously does not sit well who those who believe much of mainstream news takes too much of a backseat when interviewing politicians and presenting factual information by blandly presenting politics as \u201ctwo sides of the same coin\u201d as opposed to really challenging someone\u2019s platform when they make broad and divisive statements and reporting pure facts and statistics even if they heavily favor one political party more than other.\n\nTLDR; he has made many choices to cut costs and have the company appear more neutral and generally appealing therefore cutting back both creative entertainment freedom and \u201cwatchdog\u201d journalism. Many current/former fans of the affected outlets strongly disagree with these decisions.",

Booing him in public is absolutely a very direct way of people having their opinions voiced (in particular about the WGA strike here) that not only forces him to listen but also is a very peaceful way of protesting too. They\u2019re not even harassing him at his house or anything like that. \n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s really not so much about his personal life as I\u2019m sure most people really don\u2019t care that. It\u2019s that he\u2019s the head and public face of a very big company that oversees many facets of entertainment and news with his decisions having very dramatic effect on the content put out by it. It\u2019s about the business itself, a very big business that has a very direct impact on a lot of people\u2019s livelihoods on top of also producing content people used to enjoy (not as important as the writer strike issue itself but entertainment is still very much a big part of our lives).",

            "comment": "Jack Quaid, one of the stars of Amazon\u2019s\u00a0The Boys, has signed on to topline\u00a0Companion, a sci-fi thriller\u00a0from the team behind last year\u2019s horror hit\u00a0Barbarian.\n\nDrew Hancock wrote the original script and is making his directorial debut with the feature, whose many plot points are being kept hush-hush.\n\nDespite the secretive nature of the project, the pedigree is notable.\u00a0Zach Cregger, who wrote and directed\u00a0Barbarian, is producing the feature along with Raphael Margules and J.D. Lifshitz of BoulderLight Pictures, right now some of the biggest hustlers in town, and horror kingpin Roy Lee of Vertigo.\n\nBoulderLight\u2019s Tracy Rosenblum and Vertigo\u2019s Andrew Childs will executive produce.\u00a0\n\nCompanion\u00a0was won by New Line in a hot horror auction near the beginning of the year. It was initially going to act as BoulderLight and Cregger\u2019s follow-up to\u00a0Barbarian\u00a0before the filmmaker switched tracks to focus on his own script,\u00a0Weapons, also now casting and at New Line. But the team helped\u00a0Companion\u00a0land not just a home but greenlit the start of production, backing Hancock to make his directorial debut.\n\nQuaid is having a geek moment this week. The actor is one of the voice stars of the popular Paramount+ animated series\u00a0Star Trek: Lower Decks\u00a0and starring in another hit\u00a0Star Trek\u00a0show,\u00a0Stranger New Worlds. In the\u00a0trailer\u00a0for the series, it was revealed that he would be crossing his character, Ensign Boimler, over to the live-action realm when the new season begins June 17. \u00a0\n\nQuaid also starred in Paramount\u2019s 2022 sequel of\u00a0Scream\u00a0alongside legacy cast members Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette, and next appears as part of the all-star cast of Christopher Nolan\u2019s\u00a0Oppenheimer,\u00a0which includes\u00a0Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt.\u00a0Oppenheimer\u00a0is due to hit theatres on July 21.\n\nThe actor is repped by UTA, Anonymous Content, and Sloane Offer.",

I actually gave the rest of my coke to someone bc I didn\u2019t even want to finish what I\u2019d bought.

Tobey is buddies with Leo, and had a substance abuse problem before he was famous, then 8 years into sobriety, lands the spider man role.  Afterwards, hes noted for scamming a bunch of people in a boozy poker game, so there was some type of falling off the wagon.  The silver lining to the story is, Tobey and Leo in The Great Gatsby movie, so the friends getting back together.\n\nEdit2: the \"scam\" factor might be debatable.  He was effectively playing as a shark among a bunch of rich hollywood people.\n\nEdit3: jesus, I know he was succesful, but we're talking Leo DeCaprio here.  Tobey was never anywhere near his levels of success.",

There are some norms and informal or house rules about how it should go down, but of course it's often word of honor and people's reputations keeping them honest so there is always going to be abuse. \n\nAlthough typically, when you stake someone, you only get a percentage of their winnings (otherwise, what's the point.. just so they can make you money?). So it's effectively a discount on anything you lose to them, not exactly free. Still a huge issue that can effect strategy in a big way. But all of that is still assuming your stake doesn't in turn lose they money they won from you to someone else on the table before you get paid out. So it's definitely an advantage that effects strategy, but isn't some foolproof hack. \n\nActive collusion (agreeing to work together beforehand, or even worse, communicating during the game somehow) is still way worse.",

It seems that because he didn\u2019t get Spider-Man, he was then able to move into call me by your name and started a different trajectory. \n\nNow that he\u2019s been on the awards circuit and is moving into blockbuster film territory, it seems like he is moving in an opposite direction from clamoring to do any type of movie. Not that Spider-Man was any less important, but would\u2019ve set him on a different path since he was unknown at the time. It can really hinder newer actors and pigeon hole them. Well established actors who enter superhero movies tend to have a better capability of getting out and back into various movie roles, at least that\u2019s how it seems to me. \n\nAll that said though, Leo is from a different time of acting. It all depends on what any given actor wants for their career. Leo found all of his fame before superhero movies gain mass popularity, and so he has a different viewpoint of Hollywood and the like. He also chased an Oscar almost all of his career, and you can\u2019t do that with super hero movies at all.",

They didn't pretty her up until the character wanted to look prettier.  \n\n\nI do love actors who don't mind not looking their best in roles. Zendaya is clearly beautiful but it isn't her identity.",

No acting would have beaten that.\n\nTimothy seems to have a good hand selecting projects and at this point going \"hyper\" mainstream would be a step back if not carefully selected. His \"Wonka\" role seems to be the walking the line perfectly.\n\nBut not everybody can be Leo who just asks for the next \"bigger then life\" biopic and two directors fall over each other to give him the 20mil role. He carved a place for himself, as Cruise or Damon. Being \"hot\" in the system has an expiration date and maybe you need to do *things* to stay relevant.",

Henry Cavill had talked about how hard it is to get into anything but action bc casting directors see him only as such.\n\nAdam Driver said his agent begged him to do marriage story to make sure his Star Wars role didn't make him only seen as an action guy.\n\nTobey Maguire never recovered from Spiderman. It ruined Andrew Garfield although No Way Home resurrected him and made his musical movie a bankshot. \n\nRyan Reynolds talked about how he hoped his early xmen role would break him out of rom com type cast, but Green Lantern hurt his casting in non action stuff not just bc it was a bomb bc it was a hero action bomb. \n\nScores of guys n gals have had a tough time. Gal Godot can't get \"normal\" casting. Natalie Portman scoffed at Thor 1, but other roles were drying up so took it to stay relevant and hated it but that's not the same thing\n\nOlder established actors taking roles in MCU is good buisness like Rob fn Redford. \n\nBut best case examples: Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer. Both had their rocketship careers derailed. And they were in the good super successful movies. \n\nGeorge Clooney was on the fast track from ER and Batman/Robin killed it dead. He had to self finance small flicks with friends like Jerry Weintraub,  that turned out to be diamonds in Out of Sight and Oceans 11 to get back in the game.",

He's not on Bale status yet but he's got a while to prove his worth and I am here for it.",

Both times it was so painful that someone could know him so intimately and hurt him so badly at the same time. The look on his face of anguish and confusion, that hurt. I knew that look all too well.",

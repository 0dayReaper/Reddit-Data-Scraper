The first movie, released during the pandemic in both theaters and on HBO Max, remains one of the streamer\u2019s biggest hits to date.\n\nRudolph will play Kitana, a character first introduced\u00a0in\u00a0Mortal Kombat II, the video game that thrust the franchise into the 1990s pop culture mainstream and made it what it is today. Kitana, known for her cutthroat steel fans, became one of the video game series\u2019 signature characters.\n\nKitana has a close bond with Jade, a popular\u00a0Kombat\u00a0character who will be\u00a0played by Gabrielle. The casting reunites the two actresses who were closely linked on\u00a0Sabrina, playing part of a trio of deadly mean girls known as the Weird Sisters.\n\nUrban, meanwhile, is playing fan-favorite character Johnny Cage, an action movie star who enters the Mortal Kombat tournament in order to prove to naysayers he is able to do his own stunts. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nProducing\u00a0Kombat 2\u00a0are Atomic Monster\u2019s James Wan and Michael Clear, and Broken Road Productions\u2019 Todd Garner. McQuoid and E. Bennett Walsh are also producing.\n\nMaking her screen debut with\u00a0Sabrina, Hong Kong-born model-turned-actress Rudolph also had a stint on CW\u2019s\u00a0Riverdale\u00a0and co-starred in Netflix\u2019s\u00a0Resident Evil\u00a0series, which debuted in 2022. She is currently filming the female lead in Millennium\u2019s\u00a0Hellboy: The Crooked Man, directed by Brian Taylor.\n\nRudolph is repped by APA, Luber Roklin Entertainment, and Goodman Genow.\u00a0",

You think they'd be the most primed for it to be honest. With Mckellan, I think it was less the green screen, but the fact that he was acting alone, to be dropped in in post.",

He wasn\u2019t really into the \u2018family\u2019 idea and took him some time to really embrace it.\n\nI love that in one of those prior movies when they\u2019re talking about what Rocket is, there\u2019s a derogatory response about a crazy scientist creating him in a lab LOL",

I'm not defending how empty Marvel movies are by the way I'm just trying to disagree with you on the fact that acting in front of a green screen is necessarily a bad thing.",

How do you know when there\u2019s acting required?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;HOPKINS: I try to apply it to everything I do: no acting required. On \u201cThor,\u201d you have Chris Hemsworth\u2014who looks like Thor\u2014and a director like Kenneth Branagh, who is so certain of what he wants. They put me in armor; they shoved a beard on me. Sit on the throne; shout a bit. If you\u2019re sitting in front of a green screen, it\u2019s pointless acting it. Gregory Peck was doing \u201cMoby Dick,\u201d and one of the props guys found his script on the set. He opened it up and Gregory Peck had written on a certain page, \u201cN.A.R.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Interviewer: Oh, you got it from Gregory Peck!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;HOPKINS: So he asked, \u201cWhat does this mean, Mr. Peck?\u201d He said \\[launching into a booming Peck impression\\], \u201cNo acting required. You just look at the sea, and that\u2019s it!\u201d And that\u2019s true.\n\nHopkin's point was that it's something he applies to all roles, and that acting was pointless as a testament to the production. That acting should be effortless and natural.",

But when I think of his Odin, and how much Kenneth Branagh cared about that film and that character, I can\u2019t see Hopkins as being openly dismissive of it.

Who\u2019s the next Leo? De Niro? Even guys like Will Smith or Jim Carrey who oozed charisma and could put butts in seats during their 90s-2000s run. It\u2019s like Hollywood will pick someone like Chalamet and try to make him the next Leo by putting him in every big project but it doesn\u2019t make him a star, at least by Tarantino\u2019s terminology and what I always envisioned a star was.",

He was a wonderful Odin and brought a lot of heart to a character many other actors would leave hollow and superficial. It\u2019s also, surprisingly, the only time he\u2019s ever worked with Kenneth Branagh. I thought they made good collaborators.\n\nI\u2019ve always said there\u2019s two kinds of actors I admire - but only one of those two that I love and respect beyond all measure. The first is the kind that can play King Lear or Emperor Garbunzonk of Planet Zarfobg, and the second is the kind that can do that, but respects the audiences equally for both roles, delights in both roles, and puts their all into it, no matter what. \n\nI am sad that Hopkins is the first. Kenneth Branagh, at least, is firmly the second, and has my love as well as my respect. Because he himself respects his audience and loves what he does, no matter if it\u2019s Hamlet or Wild Wild West.\n\nEdit: apparently this article mischaracterized his quote. He was in no way dissing Branagh\u2019s work on the film or his own. He was actually saying that he trusted Branagh and the production so much that he knew he didn\u2019t have to compensate for anything or \u201csell\u201d the role like he does for productions he\u2019s less confident in. Sad to see him taken out of context and made to look like a jerk when he wasn\u2019t. I expected better from the BBC.",

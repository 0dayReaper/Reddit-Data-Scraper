However, Adidas said in its statement that it was the \u201csole owner\u201d of all design rights to existing products that came out of the partnership, as well as previous and new colorways arising from the [collaboration](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/business/adidas-kanye-west.html).\n\nSo unless you just really liked Kanye, and not fashion, I imagine all of the clothes he helped design will still be in production and sale next year. Just with Adidas logos.\n\nEdit: Some of you are in a [cult](https://culteducation.com/warningsigns.html).",

Then Rudolf thought that Adi denounced Rudolf as more of a nazi and the 2 split. Btw, even though I say Rudolf was more into Nazism, need to mention that Adi was in the party, profiteered from the party and was a hitler youth counselor. Side note on that, he got a lot of the charges and statuses dropped in part due to the fact that he hid at least 1 Jewish man from the gestapo and warned others.",

The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.\u201d\n\n- Jean-Paul Sartre",

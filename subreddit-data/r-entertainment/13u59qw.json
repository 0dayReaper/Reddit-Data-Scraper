They butchered one of my favorite cartoons. \n\nI'm really wary about live action remakes, they feel very much like knock offs.

I can tell you about experiences of Asians in western countries, being spat at, having excrement put through your letter box, down to people threatening you physically. For you to say what black people experience in Asia is equivalent to these things is just dishonest, and disingenuous.\n\nI'm not being defensive, I'm saying the whole \"Asians the most racist\" nonsense is incorrect because you are regurgitating crap. How do you know for certain that the Little Mermaid did badly in Asia, because we all hate black people? How can something like Black Panther be so popular? Plus multiple movies with black leading actors, from Denzel, Will Smith and others. It's just low hanging fruit to say it's all down to one reason, without looking at the critical mauling the film has gotten.\n\nThat's all I have to say on the subject, I'm not prepared to engage further with a racist such as yourself.",

Many Asians are extremely image focused, so the wide eyes that have probably been amplified by memes, as well as the lack of bright red hair, and yes, there is an element of her ethnicity too for some of them., has kind of put them off.",

Personally think the \u201cattractiveness\u201d issue was the number 1 issue and then the skin color issue.",

I only saw one post about it. \n\nBut overall, from an outsiders view, it was stupid to switch the race from white to black. For me atleast , I don\u2019t wanna watch the movie cause it won\u2019t have the same magic as the original. I\u2019m used to seeing her since childhood and to suddenly do a switch, nah. Same thing with Bella. Hated beauty and the beast. \n\nAmericans were happy since it\u2019s celebrating and representation to African Americans, but the rest of the world doesn\u2019t care about the race issue in America. We don\u2019t. That\u2019s why it\u2019s doing well in America (domestically) and flopping internationally. So we simple aren\u2019t interested. \n\nWhereas people are pumped to see Barbie cause she\u2019s the same iconic doll and character we grew up and loved. The main character, Barbie from Malibu is the same blonde fair and blue eyes. And rather than changing the race of the original Barbie, they introduced more characters of difference races. So Mattel will win over this movie any day.",

Changing skin color also has some factor into it since including myself just wanted it more like original in casting. \n\nAlso I am not sure if you live in Asia or not but Chinese is definitely very racist to Blacks overall.

However, The Green Book was not just envisioned with a black lead from the very start, but him being black was literallty the foundation of the story's plot and themes. The same can not be said for The Little Mermaid, as she was originally white.\n\nFurthermore, The Black Panther is also a Disney owned movie, but it has effectively an entirely black cast and its entire story centers around a fictional black empire. If your assumptions were correct then this movie would absolutely bomb in countries like China, but it made over a million dollars in China.",

Other identities are much more forefront in your conception of yourself.\u201d",

(Same idea though.)\n\nIt's rarely spoken out loud that's what the focus is on, but the shots of Jodie Foster and the men around her in some scenes are kind of brilliant. \n\nShe's in a primarily male occupation so she's constantly surrounded by men, the camera is slightly lower so she's being towered over and is *constantly* receiving looks. Some obvious and some side-eyed. Many little comments are thrown out, again some obvious and some more subtle. \n\nMeanwhile the movie just keeps going, she soldiers on, trying to do her job and go on with her life while dealing with a lot of disheartening moments.\n\nI'm drawing a blank on a good example for race right now but I really liked how the topic was handled in that one.",

That she was actually scared by him.   \n\nI also watched Lipton ask Hopkins what the hardest part of playing Lecter was, and he said something to the effects of \"no fidgeting, being still\".  He's incredibly fidgety in that interview and it occurred to me that the stillness is what's so very unnerving about Lecter.  He also seemed to reduce the amount of blinking he did, which did increased his level of sinister.\n\nI don't blame Foster for being scared of that.  \n\nIt's really interesting to watch how well all of the cast played their characters, but the interesting part for me is how close the viewer wants to get to someone like Lecter.   His character became a friend, a mentor to her and became almost kind to her.  Everyone was so well written and the direction was genius, the view of her character and the sexism was definitely well played...wasn't in your face, wasn't a social statement, yet it was.  \n\nAbsolutely a brilliant film.   I think I need to watch it again soon.",

But neither is a sum total personality trait and so, many people are both good and evil to varying degrees.",

The [Internment Camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans) were where he landed after being talked down from doing worse.\n\nEDIT: So I spent the last few hours trying to verify this, as it is something I have heard about before, but have not found sufficient evidence. FDR certainly had the attitude that Asian and White races should not mix, and his racism likely played a significant part in his pursuit of internment camps, but no credible source can back the idea that the president wanted to do genocide by forced sterilization. It must have been a rumor I took for fact, so apologies all around. Here's [an article](https://fdrfoundation.org/5081-2/) that at least gives details of FDR's attitudes and paints a picture of his motivations behind the Japanese internment. \n\nAs for forced sterilization in general, [it did occur in the USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization#United_States), right up until the late 1970s.",

I'm from a part of the UK where people constantly shit on us for our accent, for being practically an underclass of our own in politics etc. I remember my parents telling me that this would happen and to get rid of my Liverpool accent or else! people would shit on me. As a result, I have an accent that gets recognised as Welsh, West Country, 'posh', 'Southern' and down south 'everyone thinks I'm from the next city over. \n\nThe second people find out I'm from here, I get the usual shitty comments, and I feel a lot in common with that 'yokel' type accent in the US. People just underestimate and dunk on it completely needlessly. It's even an accent that gets shit on by people from other countries who have never heard anything but stereotypes, it's terrible.",

People quickly learn they need to lose that working-class Worcester or South Boston accent if they want to move up out of their socioeconomic class.\n\nAnyway, your parents weren't wrong. The stronger your regional accent, the more likely you are to be from a more rural area, or lower socioeconomic class, at least that as been my experience in the US. All of the US, even places you might not think about it like Los Angeles, where a strong Hispanic (even among native English speakers) or Black vernacular accent marks you as from a poorer neighborhood.

If I do have a problem, I have to be over the top polight or again this will be perceived as violence towards the other person. In general I have to not make problems because if the cops are called (whether I do it or not) I will be perceived as the problem first. I actually go out of my way when I see a bad driver to just let them pass because I don't want to get into an accident and have to deal with cops or the general public anymore than is necessary to get from point A yo point B. \n\nWhile it's nice that some can live a life of not walking on eggshells black males don't get that luxury in America. I truly wish I sympathized with this guys view point but it's not close to reality for me.\n\nEdit: I read some of the comments here and I see a lot of \"I don't notice race\" and I'll ask those people this. Do you treat every race you come in contact with the same? Are you shorter with some than others? Do you avoid talking  to people of other races because you think they will \"cause a scene\"? OK that's you noticing race and not noticing it at the same time. Now ask yourself if the person on the other end feels it.....the answers yes every time.\n\nEdit: so this got me suspended from reddit.....smh this is exactly the shit I'm talking about.",

I remember a guy giving the description of a suspicious male as having a \"black build.\" WTF does that even mean?? Had a lady tell me, \"You know how black people get when they drink.\" Uh, no ma'am, I don't. It's shocked me so much that my brain couldn't process enough to tell her that I was black.

You don\u2019t see what other people go through, and you don\u2019t hear their stories.  You assume everyone is being treated the same way you are.\n\nAnd that also helps contribute to the belief in black criminality.  White people might have the experience of the police always treating them politely, and assume that they give everyone the same courtesy, and the same benefit of the doubt.  So then when a black man is pulled over and then arrested or shot, they jump to the conclusion that, \u201che must have done something to provoke the police.\u201d  They\u2019re thinking, \u201cwell I\u2019ve had some interactions with police, and they\u2019re always polite and professional!\u201d\n\nThen you make a black friend, you hear their stories, and you see how they\u2019re treated.  A lot of things fall into place, and you realize, \u201cOh\u2026 I\u2019ve been way too much on the side of racist assholes.\u201d",

Like people don\u2019t want a female version James Bond *or* whatever the hell that Red Sparrow film was, they want a unique character with her own strengths, weakness, and arcs that just so happens to be female. Characters are allowed to just *be* in the minority without having to make it their sole personality trait. Of course, movies being made about the minority experience are also important. But it\u2019s an issue when there\u2019s 1. Blatant misinformation and poor understanding and 2. When all the movies featuring minority characters end with the characters suffering. All. The. Time.",

Black, black, black.\u201d Some days, though, I look in the mirror like \u201cI have a job interview tomorrow. I should see if I can make an appointment to get my hair straightened.\u201d Because my hair is sometimes deemed \u201cunprofessional\u201d in it\u2019s natural state. When I\u2019m out and about with friends and I see a cute guy, I have to do all sorts of mental calculations to figure out if he\u2019s into black women. Most times I decide it\u2019s not worth it. Up until the last few years, I had trouble finding makeup that was my shade. And it\u2019s just a never ending stream of those little fucking things, that just grate at your nerves, in addition to the big things, that maybe don\u2019t affect me personally (not yet anyway), but still add to this constant awareness I still have to factor my blackness into everything. And it\u2019s not something I really want to do. I\u2019d rather go about my day, but when I get turned away from hair salons because they don\u2019t know how to do my hair type, or when someone says I\u2019m more articulate than they expected, or when I get followed around in a store, you can\u2019t help but think about it.",

It\u2019s because they\u2019re not actual good thought out plots, just generic repeated garbage that try to ride off of the identity or race of the main characters. Nobody cares the main character of The Hunger Games was ever a female, because she actually had motivations and was made to be an intriguing main character. They\u2019re not forcing you to stop and take a second to acknowledge badass female main lead doing badass things. (For example, the really forced all female fight scene in avengers endgame even though I kind of enjoyed it.) \n\nIt\u2019s moments in shows and movies where people, \u201cacknowledge their identity\u201d that takes people out of it. Just rock who you are and be proud of it, use that energy to actually act good instead of using cheap virtue signaling for a quick buck.",

Like Turning Red. Despite it simply being about the life of an Asian girl in an Asian household and race wasn't the topic of the story, you had critics complain that they can't \"relate\" to her for being a young, teenage, asian female character. Or the new LOTR series where they can't imagine elves of a different skin color. So the second that a movie isn't about these people it's always about race.",

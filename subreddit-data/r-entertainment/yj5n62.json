Think like top golf style, but bowling alley.  \n\nWaiters/resses, nice cocktails, food, etc in downtown Houston.  Also it\u2019s located in a really nice part of downtown with shops and restaurants and such, not the typical part of town you associate bowling alleys with lol.  The news is saying it was a private party so they probably had the place rented out.  Still, why start shooting over a dice game?  damn, it\u2019s gotta stop",

Just something a lot of peoples parents/grandparents used to say when they watched their tv shows - kids have memories of the \u201cstories\u201d being a dusty dry soap opera or procedural drama whereas younger generations like mine use it with a twinge of irony when referring to something like anime or watching something like an old SpongeBob episode\n\nEdit: I think everyone reading this should share a story about their parents/grandparents watchin their stories - for me it was general hospital or mattock, grandma was busy watchin her stories but after they were done I\u2019d get the best grilled cheese I\u2019ve ever eaten. Every time.",

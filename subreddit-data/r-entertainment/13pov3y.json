It\u2019s worth making the most of these, because it\u2019s six and a half more than you\u2019ll see her deploy over the next hour and three quarters.\u00a0\n\nFor the first two instalments of this colossally gormless series, Jocelyn\u2019s face is frozen in a glassy-eyed, brink-of-tears mou\u00e9, as she weathers the sheer relentless hell of being a rich, popular, conventionally attractive American woman in her early 20s who lives in an enormous mansion in Los Angeles.\n\nThis HBO drama about a [Britney Spears](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/britney-spears-documentary-shames-us/) or Miley Cyrus-like pop star on the edge is the brainchild of Euphoria creator Levinson, nightclub mogul Reza Fahim, and Abel Tesfaye, otherwise known as pop star [The Weeknd](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/sublime-new-album-dawn-fm-weeknd-proves-ghoulish-wizard-modern/). And when it was announced the opening two (of five) episodes would be screening at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival, critics\u2019 nostrils started twitching: the scent of a fiasco was already on the wind.\u00a0\n\nIn April last year it was announced that much of the show would be reshot at great expense, due to a fallout between its original director, Amy Seimetz, and Tesfaye, who was concerned her take on the material had foregrounded a \u201cfemale perspective\u201d.\n\nWell, the new take, directed by Levinson, certainly can't be accused of that. If there was ever any satirical or cautionary element in this story of a young woman being chewed up by the fame machine, it\u2019s now nowhere to be seen: overall you\u2019d have to say the show is extremely pro the chewing, and in fact thinks the chewing is desperately sexy and hot \u2013 and perhaps even hashtag-empowering, if you squint a bit.\u00a0\n\n**Read the review in full:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/the-idol-cannes-review-lily-rose-depp-the-weeknd/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/the-idol-cannes-review-lily-rose-depp-the-weeknd/)",

While I think Euphoria has truly superb episodes and moments, it primarily suffers because he lacks the ability to tell an over-arching story over the course of a season. Assassination Nation, in my mind, is his best if imperfect work.\n\nHis penchant for aesthetic, even exploitative stylism recalls one of my favorite directors, Brian De Palma, but De Palma rarely wrote his own scripts because he had the self-awareness to know he was a director not a writer.\n\nIf Levinson could pull his head out of his own ass, stuck to making films and not writing them himself, I believe he could become an exceptional filmmaker. Most directors have massive egos (as a working screenwriter I've seen it firsthand), which I think is often times necessary to oversee the chaos of making a film and make bold artistic choices, but if you surrender entirely to your ego, your stuff can become a bloated mess.\n\nYou see him as a hack, and while I disagree I don't fault anyone for that perspective, I just think he's a misguided artist with talent who could benefit by taking a step back and recognizing his own limitations, of which there are several.",

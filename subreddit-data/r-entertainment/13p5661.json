Unlike the rest of the series, it felt extremely theatrical, so it was super out of place for me.\n\nIts frustrating sometimes that people on the internet arent all from Poland, because I would just say \"it felt like a Teatr Telewizji\" and everyone would knew what I mean. For the last 66 years polish national television regularly broadcasts television plays - a very specific genre that basically declined in west in 80s - and these transmissions are known as Teatr Telewizji. Kang in Loki felt extremely like television play which completely ruined any immersion I had and made me disinterested in plot completely.\n\nHe actually was much better in Ant-man for me, because he at least didnt feel like teleported to this show from polish television plays :P",

They quickly fired his ass and he went over to DC where he made a great movie for that studio and delayed the Guardians 3 film from production - all costing Marvel .. what? at least a BILLION Dollars?  \n\n\nNow he's leading their top rival studio's production...  when DC should be dying on the vine.  That one, single bone head \"pussy\" decision cost them and also threw a huge lifeline to their prime competition.  \n\n\nSo they banked on this guy John Majors and he goes and gets into a fight with a \"girlfriend\" in the back of a cab (idiot).   Now it's a story that should have all been shut down before it started.  IF Majors had a problem they should have gotten him a 24 hour minder to keep him straight.   IF and when he screws up, then it's time to haul  Majors  off to some house in Hollywood or put under \"studio confinement\" on some island somewhere till things blew over.  \nThat's how the old school Hollywood players would have handled it.\n\nHell it would be cheaper to pay her some money, buy a home and put her in it in whatever state she came from.  The studio would own it and let her live there free as long as majors career was continuing to be doing well.    IF he doesn't get bad mouthed or what happened gets leaked in 50 years the place gets transferred into her name and that's the end of it. Chances are good that she'll be dead by that time or nobody will care.  \n\n\nThey could have kept the guy they placed all their bets and made a shit ton of money   \nBut they let it all get out of control and now it's all over the courts and the gossip media that he's a woman abuser.  \n\n\nMarvel needs to toughen up AND level up in their game.",

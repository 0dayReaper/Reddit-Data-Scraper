Or is it a narrative he has crafted and leaned into because it successfully sells to crazies? \n\nIs he smart enough to know he is full of shit but simply doesn\u2019t care because it works for him? Or is he like the My Pillow Guy who has swallowed so much bullshit that he now honestly believes he is a patriot spreading the truth?",

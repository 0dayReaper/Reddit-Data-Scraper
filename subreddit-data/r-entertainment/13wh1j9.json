Across a 64-year career, there is, admittedly, a lot to consider. It\u2019s to her credit that the Hollywood star of films and television shows including Barbarella, Klute, 9 to 5 and Grace and Frankie still has the good grace to reflect carefully on every answer.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d she says eventually, smiling. \u201cI feel my best now. Is that weird? I\u2019m... how old am I?\u201d she laughs. \u201cEighty-five? I feel fine right now, actually. And I have for quite some time.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSpeaking from the Cannes Film Festival, dressed in a white shirt and a blue jacket (\u201cboth Maxmara\u201d) with a pop of L\u2019Oreal\u2019s Color Riche in Audacious on her lips (\u201cthe best lipstick\u201d), Fonda looks more than fine: she looks bright-eyed and beautiful, despite having been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in September 2022.\u00a0\n\nAfter a successful course of chemotherapy, the cancer is now in remission, and Fonda says she feels good. It taught her, she has said, to live with \u201cno regrets\u201d and to \u201cget the things done that you want to get done\u201d. She is thoroughly enjoying herself in Cannes, hanging out with her \u201cpals\u201d Kate Winslet and Eva Longoria. If she has generally slowed down her work pace, it has been hard to notice in the last few months as she has continued her Greenpeace activism weekly on social media. She became an activist in the 1970s, protesting against the Vietnam war and earning the nickname \u201cHanoi Jane\u201d.\u00a0\n\n***Keep reading:*** \n\n[***https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/people/jane-fonda-you-have-to-stay-flexible-if-you-want-to-continu/***](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/people/jane-fonda-you-have-to-stay-flexible-if-you-want-to-continu/)",

If you don\u2019t work out when you\u2019re young, your body will forgive you. When you\u2019re older, if you don\u2019t keep moving, stay flexible and keep your muscles strong, it really makes a difference.\u201d \nSuch as? \u201cGetting in and out of cars. You don\u2019t want to take ten minutes to do it because you don\u2019t have strength in your thighs and back. Picking up a grandchild. You want to still be able to do it. When you\u2019re driving, you want to be able to steer and look over your shoulder where you\u2019re going.\u201d She looks deftly over her left shoulder, as flexible as a gymnast. I tell her I already struggle to look over my shoulder, and feel like everything is crumbling. \n\n&gt; If you want to look and feel your best in your 80s, Fonda advises that you put in the work throughout your 40s and 50s. \u201cI started really working out in my 40s, but before I started, I felt like I was falling apart. So it\u2019s not too late. Just start doing it.\u201d \nFonda was born in New York in 1937. Her father was the actor Henry Fonda and her mother was a Canadian-born socialite called Frances Seymour. When Fonda was 12, her mother killed herself in a psychiatric hospital, although Fonda only discovered this later. \n\nI knew this already knew that but I\u2019m pasting this bit because a lot of you might not. \n\n&gt; Her three-point plan for fitness? \u201cFirstly, you have to stay strong, which means you have to do resistance work, whether with elastic bands or weights to keep your muscles strong, and that protects your bones. The second thing is aerobic fitness \u2013 you have to keep your heart strong, so that you can walk upstairs without getting all out of breath.\u201d The third pillar is flexibility. \u201cYou have to stay flexible. Especially if you want to continue having sex when you\u2019re over 50. You\u2019ve got to be able to put your legs over your head, right? I can still do that.\u201d \n\n.. I think the takeaway from that particular line is just what kind of sex Jane was having in her 50s.",

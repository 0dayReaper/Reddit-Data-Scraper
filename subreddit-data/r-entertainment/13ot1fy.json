One little stage in the middle of a massive stadium didn\u2019t make sense, didn\u2019t involve the crowd. When the spectacle envelopes the entire arena, at least the people in the nosebleeds can actually see something happening. \n\nKnock it, fairly, for being cartoonish and un-punk, but the idea of making a big enough production for everyone to see (in the ages before Jumbotrons as well) started off as at least fairly pro-fan.",

Flamethrower backpacks. flamethrower instruments. flamethrower cannons and to round it out some 'regular' flamethrowers. It's everywhere. For fucks sake, the guitarist is wearing a fire retardant suit and gets sprayed with fire during the set. I know he had a cauldron to hide in, but the dude literally is like, wouldn't it be cool if you sprayed me with fire during the set?\n\nRammstein's show is wild.",

I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have a unique perspective with different takes, but IMO it totally depends on what you\u2019re interested in / willing to do\n\nMost people I worked with either started out as performers, sound engineers, stagehands, merch guys, and/or just networked their way into it. Some stayed in those roles, others moved into photography, PR, tour management, performing, etc.\n\nThere\u2019s no real linear way to do it but it\u2019s pretty easy to get stagehand gigs at local venues or if you want to run sound at smaller clubs. Depending on your skills, a band may pick you up for sound on a tour or take you on the road as a gear tech etc. Like anything in the entertainment industry, money usually sucks and QOL can be brutal if it requires travel/late nights/etc. which it usually does. But to each their own. I enjoyed it but ultimately decided to get out. It\u2019s a rewarding industry for *very* specific types of people",

We have to have a wide variety of skills, so just because you might not have done one job, you may have picked up skills to transition that to back of house (BOH) work. Depending on the number of venues in the area depends on how much work you get. It's mostly all independent contracting and tour world is very much who you know. Rarely find inexperienced people on a major tour, but you could look into working with regional small venue acts. Check out live nation &amp; aeg sites for hiring.",

Just seems like lunatics might have easier access to them there. \n\nBut then with a large show you are dealing with many thousands more people, so that has its own host of security problems.",

She\u2019s not an indie artist with a cult following, where she could expect to have a show in a second rate city at a generic venue with space for 800 and expect to sell 800 tickets at $40-60 each. Even the people selling tickets to stadium tours where each night can hold tens of thousands, there\u2019s still a huge issue with fans not being able to get tickets and prices being pushed to insane levels. Someone like Miley Cyrus who\u2019s got enough demand to attract 50,000 fans paying $100-300 a ticket from a large or mid sized metro area will see those tickets become beyond expensive. If only 800 fans can go to a show, the tickets are going to end up being in the thousands due to demand and seeing the concert becomes the exclusive privilege of the elite, not something middle class superfans can budget for. Miley Cyrus just doesn\u2019t strike me as the type of person who wants that to be her image as an artist, and frankly, as high energy as her shows were, it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the audience she\u2019s interested in catering for (some other celebrities might be interested in that image, but it\u2019s not something every popular celebrity wants).",

I will say though that for myself, I'll never ever remove fat from my face, I agree with you that it ages you and over time looks much worse. Miley's first upper bleph (removing fat from upper eyelid) aged her, as it did to Nina Dobrev, Britney Spears, and Pamela Anderson. Granted that's what they wanted and it's their body and they had full ability to consent. But I wouldn't do it to myself for the aging reason.\n\n\nImo this is a very western plastic surgery face: the Handsome Squidward. It's not very flattering on all face and eye shapes. Korean facial plastic surgery goals tend to be much more natural looking in comparison. \n\n\nAnd I haven't even started on how Americans do fillers and dissolve them etc and how bad that is for your skin and face. Again korea has been more cutting edge, has better mixes of filler, and does nano and microfiller with much more subtle results. A friend of mine was stung by a Sonoran bumblebee - their venom contains hyaluronidase, the enzyme we use to dissolve facial fillers. It left a permanent pit in their arm, much bigger than the tiny area that was puntunctured by the stinger. They say dissolving fillers only impacts the filler, not what's in your face - I think that's super incorrect. They are fucking up their faces from these techniques that they claim are \"fully reversible.\" And then telling them how to fix it is to go back and add new filler because the old filler just drifted (because they injected it in huge heavy lump). Maybe it's because the filler is done badly, is stretching skin, and the dissolver is creating pitting and aged akin.",

Although I still go to big venues, the phone goes away.  I'd rather sing along with songs from my favorite band considering how much money I'm dishing out.\n\nSmaller venues tend to have more energy as it is.  It's much more niche.  That's how numerous successful bands/artists got their start.\n\nOn the flip side, the music industry has changed A LOT.  We're living in times where lots of incredible bands never \"make it\" because of streaming services and the Internet.  They basically have no choice but to tour in order to pay the bills.",

That finally calmed her down and got her to put the sign away.\n\nSome people are so obnoxious.\n\nAnother funny story of attention seekers, I saw Ween play a festival once (I think it was Bonnaroo) and some guy kept yelling \"Blarney Stone! Blarney Stone!\" over and over (song he wanted them to play) and at one point Deaner looked directly at him, clearly annoyed.\n\nDeaner said \"This song is called: 'You got it.'\" and then they started playing Piss Up A Rope. Great diss, not sure the drunk guy understood it, but it was hilarious.",

It was great and some of my best photography was in that context. Even getting in the pit with a camera was at least novel to some degree, and people and bands often appreciated the photos after. I hardly see the point anymore from an artistic standpoint - it's not that I couldn't necessarily still get a better photo, it just is an unnecessary one, and being one of a handful (if not the only) photo/video person in the room mostly means you weren't in anyone's way for more than a few seconds. Now everyone is in everyone's way constantly with their phone.",

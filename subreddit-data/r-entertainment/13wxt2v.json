Whether or not she had a close  relationship with the cast off set during the heyday of the show  shouldn\u2019t really be the deciding factor of whether or not she reprises a role that pretty much handed her millions of dollars and won her thousands of loyal fans. People change over the years and from what I saw in the documentary all of the women in that cast seem like pretty decent people today so obviously she\u2019s the one with the issue. If she can\u2019t get over some petty bullshit that happened 20 years or so ago then she lives a sad life.",

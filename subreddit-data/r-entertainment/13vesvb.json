Andersen, himself, and the story may be a metaphorical depiction of his unrequited love for a male friend. The ending of Andersen's story is rather ambiguous.\n\nThe story of a supernatural / non-human loving a human is a literary theme that occurs also in the German story \"Undine\" by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9 and in the Swedish ballad \"Herr Mannelig\" where a troll woman is courting a human man, both of which Andersen was very probably aware of.",

He had a lot of friendships with both men and women, but, as far as we know, did not feel attracted to women, and the person he seems to have had the deepest feelings for happened to be a man. A lot of his stories have elements that have a meaning for adults but are not perceived by children.\n\nIt makes sense to read the story of the little mermaid like this. It's one interpretative layer, if you want. \n\nThe folk tradition of the supernatural being trying to achieve something by marrying a human is another layer. \n\nThe impossibility of being together with the person one loves also occurs in another Andersen story, \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\", where the toy soldier and the paper ballerina are only united in death.",

I mean, when it comes down to it, the only thing the prince did wrong was not falling in love with some mute stranger; heck he wasn't even aware that the little mermaid would die if he married anyone elsre. Basically, the mermaid was an idiot to risk her life for a man she knew nothing about, and it would have been really messed up to kill an innocent person to save herself from her own mistake\n\nAlso, she wasn't just marrying the prince for love, but because she wanted to become human and gain an immortal soul, which mermaids did not have... so their was more to it",

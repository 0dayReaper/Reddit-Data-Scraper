            "comment": "From what I understand, a lot of people have started labelling the lead singer as a rapist, despite him raping people not really being part of the accusation.\n\nThe first main accusation was a fan at a pre-show party, who did not seem to be making the claim against the band itself, but someone else at the party (She also took a drug test that showed no drugs in her system, but date rape drugs can fade quickly so hard to say what actually happened there). The second accusation seems to come from a girl who was drunk and sobered up whilst having sex with the singer, he asked if she wanted to stop, she said yes, so he left.\n\nNaturally there's a discussion there about consent after drinking. But the internet seems to have done its standard thing of seeing headlines, and just going \"Oh ok so the singer is a rapist then? Cool, I knew it, he always looked shady.\"\n\nNaturally I think accusations should be taken seriously. But I don't think online accusations and he said/she said should mean someone instantly loses everything and people going to their shows is suddenly a bad person. (If they're convicted of something like rape, then of course, screw them).",

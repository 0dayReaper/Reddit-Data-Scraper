Or, put another way, I once heard another defense attorney arguing for his client to go to treatment instead of jail. The prosecutor said \u201chow many chances are we going to give this guy?\u201d and his attorney said \u201cone more chance. And I\u2019ll say the same thing again if we\u2019re right back here in a few months. Always one more chance until it sticks. Because the alternative is to give up on him and let him die, and I\u2019m never going to do that.\u201d\n\nIf someone has tried seven rehabs and is still fighting their addiction, that means we need to find an eighth to try. The battle is never lost until that person loses hope. I\u2019ve seen people in Bam\u2019s position turn it around and rebuild their whole lives one brick at a time. I\u2019ve also seen them overdose and die. He\u2019s the only one who can decide his fate, ultimately\u2026 but for those around him, they can keep steering him toward recovery and providing as many opportunities to make the next right choice. I can only hope he gains that moment of clarity to see that publicly releasing a video where he threatens suicide by intentional overdose, while so many people around him beg him to get help, is rock bottom and it\u2019s time to go a different way.",

He and other people were given piles of cash and drugs and flown around the world to go and be jackasses to a traumatic level. Those other people (who remain alive, anyway) have more or less succeeded at later-stage maturity, but it's proving to be significantly more difficult for Bam (speculating: likely owing to an underlying personality and/or emotion/sensory processing disorder). He is physically addicted to drugs and alcohol, and mentally addicted to avoiding feelings by way of drugs and alcohol.\n\nI pity the fuck out of that dude and everyone around him. I speculate he always would have been some sort of narcissist, but the scope of his damage (to himself and others) could have been significantly more limited, and there are some \"good guy narcissists\" out there, who are only decent for their own social benefit- but nevertheless, they're decent (usually).",

Its not a matter of having people to help you after the 9th time, its a matter of having saints that can afford to have their things stolen 9 times and sold to buy drugs.  I absolutely dont know the solution but i do know that there are only so many times we can let dad back in the house before he does it again.  At some point its our fault we keep getting robbed by a drug addict.  At some point its our fault the cops are always at my house with the same \"hes suffering\" line as they offer no help or resources for that just add to the money we have to spend to make our lives normal.  No, its not on the people around him to continue to suffer so that he might have a fleeting chance at being normal, its on him to earn the time he steals over and over from these people.  He needs support but sadly at this point it needs to come from professionals because expecting his friends and family and \"those around him\" to keep picking up the pieces is unfair and honestly unhealthy for anyone involved.  I agree i dont think we should just let him die but \"those\" around him need to be paid proffesionals that dont get hurt when it goes bad, both emotionally and financially.",

What Steveo did is absolutely nothing short of a miracle, especially given as far gone as he was. Bam is somewhere along those lines, the lines that Steveo toed at his absolute worst. The difference is that Bam is leveraging a kid in all of this, and this kid is absolutely going to grow up seeing and knowing all of what we see and know and just *so much more*. At this point, I legitimately am waiting for the report that Bam has done something to either land him in jail or in a coffin. I hope that's not the case but man. There's the normal addict response and then there's what we've seen from Bam Margera, a man who has never been genuinely told no in his entire life.",

He doesn't need abstinence -only recovery, but rather probably should spend the rest of his life eating some THC gummies first thing every morning. He needs to be taught how to \"be here, now.\" He needs to face his demons (real or imagined) and stop running from himself.",

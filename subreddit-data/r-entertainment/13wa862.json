Their contract also expires on June 30, and the Writers Guild has been on strike for 29 days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you to join me in voting \u2018yes\u2019 on the strike authorization,\u201d Louis-Dreyfus says on the video.\n\nA \u201cyes\u201d vote, Smart says, \u201cJust means that we give the national board the power to strike if the AMPTP does not give our members the essential contract improvements they need.\u201d\n\nMajor issues referenced in the video include increased compensation, residuals, self-taping and curbs on the use of artificial intelligence to replace actors. The deadline to vote is June 5 at 5 p.m. PT.\n\nThe other 16 actors who appear in the video are: \u00a0\n\nPaul W. Downs\n\nAbbi Jacobson\n\nSophia Bush\n\nJean Smart\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus\n\nJohn DiMaggio\n\nAaron Jennings\n\nCoral Pe\u00f1a\n\nBob Balaban\n\nDaveed Diggs\n\nRafael Casal\n\nMatt Bush\n\nJodi Balfour\n\nLukas Gage\n\nTom Pelphrey\n\nSam Richardson\n\nKumail Nanjiani\n\nD\u2019Arcy Carden",

Actors, writers, and directors would have real negotiation power over their contracts if they knew how much their shows were watched in relation to other shows. Under these conditions, studios would have to prioritize quality over quantity, in turn audiences would benefit as well.",

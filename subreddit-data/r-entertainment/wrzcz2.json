And no one cares she acted older or she looked older or matured faster.  She was a child.  Why must predators be justified if the child developed physically more quickly or if they were being children who happened to wear any type of  clothing or attitude.  As adults we know better and we must be the ones to always see these are children.  Let them grow and be adults who can make their own choices.  Don't rob them of their choices to be or not to be.  Whatever they choose to be in life or who they sleep with.  But as adults.",

No shortage of famous men in history who took teen brides. \n\nThey wanted an obedient wife who was young and pretty, fertile, etc. they were reliant older men to provide financial and physical security. Fucked ip power dynamics, but that\u2019s how it was. \n\nAnd so sexualizing young teen girls was just *normal* in a lot of places for a long time. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that The Sun stopped publishing photos of topless 16 year old girls on page 3. \n\nWhen I was in high school in the US, in the 1990\u2019s, the version of Romeo and Juliet we watched was the 1968 version where the actress who played Juliet was only 15 when they filmed her naked sex scenes. \n\nAnd that\u2019s just two examples. Movies, modeling, etc. all featured young teen girls in sexually explicit context. \n\nSometime in the 1970s to early 1980s the conservative religious right teamed up with the liberal feminists to denounce pornography and the sexualization of children. \n\nEven then, they still *portrayed* teen sex. The movies may have used 18 year old actresses, but 80s movies are full of naked high school aged *characters*.\n\nIn 1988/1989 two adaptations of the same book we\u2019re made, Dangerous Liaiasons and Valmont. A prominent plot line an adult male ostensibly helping a teen girl write love letters to her crush, but he uses it to seduce / rape her.  One had a barely 18 Uma Thurman getting naked, and the other a 15 year old \u201ctechnically no nudity\u201d Fairuza Balk in the highly sexual role. \n\n And I have no idea if it happens still now, but in the 1990s, people would actively celebrate and countdown toward the 18th birthday of famous young women like the Olsen twins, Mandy Moore, Brittany Spears.  All of which is pretty explicitly admitting that these 15-17 year old girls were sex objects that the world was desperately waiting to be able to legally see naked. \n\nBut as we worked to confront issues of rape, the concept of consent was really fleshed out, and included deeper thoughts about everything from scientific knowledge of pre-frontal brain development, power dynamics (boss / underling, professor / student), intoxication, where even affirmative consent may not cut it if we think brain development, intoxication, power dynamics, etc. have eroded the belief that consent in such situations actually counts as *true* indisputable consent. \n\nThose concepts didn\u2019t start people fully fleshed out and engrained in mainstream thought until the 2000s. \n\nI think one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve witnessed over my lifetime is how much progress we\u2019ve made as a society on this front where now, age, maturity, brain development, intoxication, power dynamics, and how all these things interact with the concept of consent is pretty much common knowledge with pretty widespread acceptance. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing!\n\nBut it\u2019s also something that\u2019s only about a generation old.",

I'm saying that him raping girls was so known about by the music industry that he flaunted it through Aaliyah and not one person batted an eye, so the entire industry was complicit. \n\nThe actual rapes are the actual worst part of his actions but the fact that he was basically allowed to do it *and* tell everyone that he was gonna keep doing it with impunity... is pretty fuckin bad. \n\nI remember it came out that he liked to piss on the *girls* he'd rape (they said slept with at the time but it was rape) and it literally became a meme for the entertainment industry to parody.",

We want the justice system to be detached from emotion, almost disinterested.\n\nEDIT: Although, full disclosure, I've just been reading about the Brock Turner case and the lenient sentence he received. The judge in that case was eventually recalled by the voters because he was blamed for being too lenient on Turner for raping a young woman. Many attorneys, judges, and prosecutors publicly defended the judge and made the argument that the judge applied the law as it is written and that he cannot be swayed by the public's desire for more punishment. And, I find myself torn because I'm just as appalled at that sentence and I'm \u2026 happy that that judge was recalled - but that contradicts what I said initially. \n\nAnyway, my initial comment is easier said than done.",

It's not referred to as rape because having sex with someone and the circumstances around it are admissible as evidence.  Rape is a legal conclusion.  \n\nThe same way I couldn't put someone on the stand and say, you saw him shoot someone, do you agree he's a murderer?  Murder is a legal conclusion.

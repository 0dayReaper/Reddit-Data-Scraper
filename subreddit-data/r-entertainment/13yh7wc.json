The sound, visuals are so immersive. Ive seen avatar and star wars at the theatre and it does not even compare to the simpler theaters.",

I\u2019m a theater manager and we very regularly have IMAX techs come out to do overnight maintenance on the IMAX projectors. They are very picky about their image and want to make sure it\u2019s at the best quality it can be.\n\nThere\u2019s also laser and bulb projectors. The bulbs in the bulb projectors have a certain life span, but are removed before that to ensure the picture is as crisp as it can be. \n\nMy location has a LieMAX, but a friend of mine transferred to a location with actual IMAX projectors and from what I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s the same there as well.",

Based on how I assigned color positive prints were made and sent out for the DP and Nolan to view on site each day so they\u2019d know what they actually shot, and if they had to make any corrections to lighting or lenses, and if any footage wasn\u2019t up to par and had to be re-shot. \n\nAfter the finished film was edited I would have the entire movie together on reels (seven reels if I remember right), with the color assigned to the dailies. I would then sort of smooth out the color and then pass the work to the finishing color timer (fella named David Orr - best in the business. His IMDb is nuts) to fine tune in partnership with the DP. Nolan himself wasn\u2019t too involved except the very end (I never met him)\n\nI did this for TDK, TDKR, and Inception. The DP, Wally Pfister, was a master of his craft and joy to work with.  He made my job easy.",

It was mostly DPs and Directors that I worked with. Very occasional cast member but cannot think of more than like three times that happened.\n\nEdit I will say it wasn\u2019t all bad.

So sometimes I do think I would have done it another way, but the role of the timer is to make the filmmakers vision appear on screen.

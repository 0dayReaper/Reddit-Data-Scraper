After being asked by Belzer several times, Hogan put Belzer in a front chin-lock, which caused Belzer to pass out. When Hogan released him, Belzer hit his head on the floor, sustaining a laceration to the scalp that required a brief hospitalization. \n\nBelzer sued Hogan for $5 million and settled out of court for $400,000 in 1990.",

Not to mention that one guy that like r*ped Benson or whatever and she murdered him, he played multiple characters in like every iteration of L&amp;O. Same with the IA guy from SVU that became a much bigger deal in later seasons, he played a rapist murderer in LA. Just kind of weird.",

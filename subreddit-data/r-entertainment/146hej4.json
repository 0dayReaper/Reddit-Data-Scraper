There is a reason why public opinion when it comes to sexual assault is not innocent until proven guilty. The burden of proof is placed on survivors of sexual assault so much that most of them don't want to even go through the procedures of reporting. Besides, we have to acknowledge that verdicts in court are approximations of cases and not necessarily reflective of reality.",

We have laws in place as a society for a reason and while they are not full proof, we can\u2019t just go around touting our own in this righteous conviction and not a single person has agreed on what this dude did because in reality two parties were there the accuser and the accused, so yeah, it\u2019s ridiculous for us to debate this. In the comments we should just let this play out in the law, and if we feel like some injustice took place in that court of law, then we have outcry. But until then, this is all futile and just muddying the waters. Once again, I don\u2019t know who this dude is, but everyone has the right to not be judged until some kind of circumstantial evidence comes out to prove they did the crime they\u2019re accused of until then it\u2019s none of our business, lastly, until there\u2019s some kind of hard evidence no one should be making a legal decision on this man\u2019s guilt",

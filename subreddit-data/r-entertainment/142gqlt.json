It\u2019s been proven so many times that the animals they take in are adoptable but they choose euthanasia rather than adoption. Euthanizing is much easier than adopting and financial it\u2019s cheaper, saves a little cash in their pocket book. No other shelter has such a high kill rate like them, even specific hoarding situations have much higher adoption rates (70-80 adoption rate) while PETA kills like 98%. I work in this field and PETA is horrible.",

PETA takes these animals and euthanized them via injection, like what happens at veterinary hospitals. This method is virtually pain free. Those animals absolutely benefited from PETA euthanizing them. It's not ideal, but it's not as bad as those stats make it seem",

There's no way to verify it with actual evidence because PETA doesn't provide any sort of records. They once advocated that two weeks in a shelter leaves an animal too mentally unstable to be adopted as an excuse for euthanization, they took it down after people pointed out there was no actual research by any reputable source that proved that conclusion. \n\nIn reality multiple different sources have shown PETA kills perfectly healthy and adoptable animals, including people's pets. Many animal rescue and animal care orgs don't work with PETA because of this. \n\nYou can look at the kill rate of PETA and compare it to other public shelters in the same area that also have a low rejection rate for animals. Animal kill rates have consistently gone down for years across private and public shelters thanks to comprehensive spay and neuter policies. PETA is the only org with kill rates that has either stayed the same or gone up, even though they have much more resources to rehabilitate and adopt out than other shelters.",

It's a scientific fact that dogs can feel empathy and love with their owners. Cats are so smart they domesticated themselves for their own benefit.\n\nThe PETA narrative about not owning house pets only works if you believe dogs and cats are just dumb emotionless beasts, like they did in the 1800s. But then PETA also argues you can't eat animals like fish and chicken because they're actually sensitive and intelligent. \ud83d\ude44 None of it is logically consistent whatever. \n\nWe definitely need to fix the problems of overcrowded shelters and pet mills, but the idea that all house pets need to be eliminated is dumb and not based on anything other than weirdly psychopathic reasoning.",

They don\u2019t have anyone with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) on their board of directors or in any upper-level positions, though this may have changed in recent years as I\u2019ve stopped following them. They also have a history of exclusively funding a \u201csearch for the cure\u201d, which autistic people and their families find very offensive, rather than advocating for equal treatment, healthcare coverage, support for adults with ASD, etc. Again, I can\u2019t say if any of this has changed recently. Basically, they suck all the air out of any conversation about ASD, as they are the only large-scale ASD \u201cvoice\u201d anyone has heard of, and they funnel a lot of dollars that could be going towards the aforementioned causes (which are the ones people with ASD and their families REALLY NEED). In short, fuck Autism Speaks. \n\nSide note: I\u2019ve heard similar things about the Susan G. Komen Foundation, the folks behind every breast cancer benefit/march/whatever and the pink ribbons. \n\nSource: I have a child on the spectrum, who DOES NOT need to be cured, but could sure use some additional support structures.",

Then in recent years they revisited that story, only it was now revealed that ManBearPig is totally real but for awhile nobody believes Gore or takes the threat as seriously as they should even as he goes around killing people, and even after they accept his existence the town is unable to fully banish him as they're unwilling to make the small sacrifices he demands in order to end his rampage (in this case soy sauce and \"Red Dead Redemption 2\").\n\nI thought it was pretty well done, as retractions go. Although as others have pointed out, their initial storyline probably did an outsize amount of damage, considering it was dropped at something of an inflection point in the conversation around climate change. So it's up in the air as to whether the later episodes were really enough of an apology / retraction.",

Because even though it\u2019s the most important work that we do, it\u2019s not sexy enough for them. I also don\u2019t see them in any of our wildlife rehabilitation centers, yet they\u2019ll preach until they\u2019re blue in the face about how they expect others to treat wildlife. \n\nThey also swear that I only use lethal means of controlling wolf populations, even convincing their supporters to spam my management claiming that I\u2019m killing an endangered species. Best part of it all: I\u2019ve never even killed one. We\u2019re not allowed to, ALL that we do is non-lethal, hours, weeks, months of it. But according to PETA, I\u2019ve killed hundreds of them",

This is just flat dishonest, and they have to know it.   There's no such thing as a 100% hypoallergenic dog, in that there will always be someone \\*so\\* allergic that they can't be around  any animal.  But there are absolutely breeds which someone with a bad allergy can be around without symptoms.  They tend to be super expensive, and responsible breeders will make you come and sit with the animal for a long time to make sure your allergies don't react.  It is crazy, crazy hard to find such animals in shelters, and if you do find one, odds are that there are serious behavioral issues that made someone give up such an expensive pet.  Even if there are one or two in the city of New York, what is he going to do?  Travel to each shelter and rub his face in a bunch of dogs that might be that kind of doodle?\n\nGet out of here.  Davidson is exactly right.  They came after him because he's a public figure, and outrage journalism brings in donations.",

I always tell people it\u2019s a bit like adopting a child out of foster care- you\u2019ll still wind up with a beloved family member, but the amount of work/cost/emotional labor you may need to undertake to straighten out a kid or animal that has gone through  potentially serious trauma (and who may have had a lot of basic needs and care neglected early on) can be TREMENDOUS. Not everybody is going to be able to handle that commitment, and that\u2019s okay. \n\nDogs should be taken on because you want companionship and the breed/energy level fits your lifestyle. If you only want to adopt a dog from a shelter because someone guilted you into it or you want to stroke your own ego, you are not bringing an animal into your life for the right reasons.",

His dad died in 9/11 and he jokes about that more than anything- he uses humor to cope with loss and pain. The actual joke was not at the expense of the victims, it was a joke about how famous Ariana had become. It\u2019s still tasteless, but idk I think Pete gets an unfair amount of shit for something almost every popular comedian does. \n\n2.) can you provide a source for this? I have heard this rumor many times, but cannot find any reputable outlet or source for this rumor. It seems like it mostly gained traction after Kanye West accused him of sending the pics, publicly, on IG. I really don\u2019t think it happened, but if it did, that\u2019s completely indefensible and is several steps beyond douchey. \n\nhttps://www.tmz.com/2022/03/14/pete-davidsons-bed-photo-to-kanye-resurfaces-mac-miller-rumor/\n\n3.) SNL didn\u2019t take him seriously. There were entire episodes where he got no airtime. Prior to him dating Ariana Grande and becoming a household name, he was lucky if he made it into a single live sketch. He was basically only there for pre-tapes and occasional weekend updates. I remember being really active on the SNL sub during that time and people constantly pointed out how little Pete contributes and speculated on what kind of blackmail he has on Lorne to remain employed. \n\n4.) I haven\u2019t heard about this, but that\u2019s messed up. \n\nIdk, dude\u2019s not perfect by any stretch but the amount of hate he gets compared to other celebrities is so disproportionate. People will forgive and forget assault allegations, racism, shameless greed and environmental pollution, etc. but they will never forget about whatever offensive joke Pete made a few years ago. He honestly seems like an okay guy to me- he doesn\u2019t seem interested in crafting a bullshit PR image for the media. Consequently, he winds up putting his foot in his mouth sometimes, which is pretty relatable. I find that refreshing.",

It wasn't them 'not taking him seriously.' It's up to the cast members to prove their worth. Pete was shut out of live sketches because he's really not a good live sketch actor at all. He's a good standup and is fine in things like Bupkis.\n\nIf anything Pete didn't take SNL seriously. He took off whenever he wanted and was barely there his final season. I know a few of those absences were for rehab, before anyone points that out.",

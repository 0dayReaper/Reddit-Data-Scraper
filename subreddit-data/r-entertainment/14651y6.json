While production is slated to start later this year, we\u2019ve come across an exciting new rumor that hints that production might be even further along than we know.\n\nAccording to industry insider\u00a0Daniel RPK, Jodie Turner-Smith has been cast as the female lead of the film. He revealed the news early Friday.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. RPK says that her character will apparently be named Athena. With the film believed to be titled Tron: Ares, we\u2019re inclined to believe that Greek mythology will play a significant role in the story.\n\nTurner-Smith is no newcomer but, with an appearance in Lucasfilm\u2019s The Acolyte also in the pipeline, she appears poised for stardom.\n\nShe joins the previously announced Jared Leto and\u00a0Cillian Murphy.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\u00a0and\u00a0Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\u00a0director Joachim R\u00f8nning\u00a0is attached to direct\u00a0Tron: Ares, which is expected to begin filming in July and will shoot through October in Vancouver.\n\nThe script is written by Jesse Wigutow and is considered the sequel to\u00a0Tron: Legacy, directed by Top Gun: Maverick\u00a0director Joseph Kosinski. However, it is unclear if Jeff Bridges, Garett Hedlund, and/or Olivia Wilde, or any other characters from\u00a0Tron: Legacy\u00a0will return or appear in any capacity for\u00a0Tron: Ares.",

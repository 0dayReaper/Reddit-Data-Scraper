It's OK for a movie to be optimised for certain formats, but Nolan's approach seems to make the films far more difficult on anything *but* that intended format.\n\nLike, there are two IMAX screens in my entire *country* (neither of them 70mm) and from what I've heard from my American friends their sound systems don't really compare to those in the US. I guess I'm a 'cinephile', but I literally do not have the option of seeing these movies as they're \"intended to be seen\" which is fine because usually whatever approximation I can get is still good (I didn't see Dune in IMAX but it was still an incredible theatrical experience). On the other hand, the regular digital print of Tenet was almost unwatchable for me. There's designing movies to be optimised for a particular experience, and then there's being needlessly elitist and inaccessible and Nolan's pretty firmly crossed that line for me.",

I always thought it was closest to the stage.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nIn the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), the **nosebleed section** are the seats of a public area, usually an athletic [stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium) or [gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym), that are highest and, usually, farthest from the desired activity. Also known as the O\u2019Connell section\\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\\]. A common [tongue-in-cheek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-in-cheek) reference to having seats at the upper tiers of a stadium is \"sitting in the nosebleed section,\" or \"nosebleed seats.\" The reference alludes to the tendency for mountain climbers to suffer [nosebleeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleeds) at high altitudes.\n\nThe term appeared in print as early as 1953 when it was used to describe the last row in the end zone at Philadelphia's Municipal Stadium (later [John F. Kennedy Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_Stadium_(Philadelphia))) during that year's [Army-Navy American football game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army%E2%80%93Navy_Game).[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed_section#cite_note-1)",

Approximately 75% of my fossil fuel usage last year was due to an extremely inefficient heating setup in my home (which we just bought last year) and as we make improvements the usage will shrink significantly.\n\nThink about how much more he probably uses beyond the private jet. Multiple homes (probably often empty and climate controlled), yacht, commercial flights, food waste, automobiles\u2026.",

This will mean carbon usage will have a higher price  which means everyone is incentivized to use less carbon. Then at the end of the year each citizen gets an equal share from the pot.\n\nThere's no reason for us to not have this system in place in a democracy. Even if you don't care about climate change, it's a clear benefit for the majority. And even people who would pay more, if they care about climate change they will be for it too.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_carbonpricing",

I mean, I'm glad I got the experience, but it was basically just a reclining seat about the size of a BarcaLounger and I still had a guy sitting next to me who made me kinda uncomfortable. They gave us fancy food and trinkets but it was still just like a regular flight experience (even the little infotainment centers on our seats were outdated). I bet if it was something like Emirates first class where I had my own space I'd have a different opinion, but I feel like the vast majority of commercial first-class experiences are a little extra legroom and some cheap, semi-useful travel souvenirs.",

You drive directly to the hangar, get out, and get on the plane.\n- once you\u2019re on the plane, assuming planning and coordination with the airport was done right, you take off within a few minutes.\n- no safety talk, no waiting for other people who would fail the first level of Tetris to put their purse in the overhead bins, no babies, no gate check, no jetway, no unruly passengers who decided to try refusing to wear a mask even though they agreed to it when buying their ticket and are now making a few hundred people pay for their aggressive stupidity.\n\nFirst class is nowhere near the same level as flying private. It\u2019s like comparing a table in the middle of the dining room vs one with a view to having a chef and team come cook at your home.\n\nIf you want to experience 80% of the benefits of flying private for about the price of economy plus, check out JetSuiteX.

Holy shit is it totally different. Not only do you get top class immediate service and whatever food you want (they ask before you board, but still give you other options if you change your mind), but there is a level of freedom commercial flights legally can\u2019t give you. \n\nYou can move about the cabin whenever you want, switch seats with impunity, walk up front and chat with the pilots, or just sit and stare out any of the plane\u2019s giant windows, which are way bigger than anything any commercial flight has to offer.  \n\nAnd the aforementioned convenience just can\u2019t be beat. In most airports I can drive up right to the plane, and someone else would take care of parking my car, or returning it to the agency if it was a rental. When you reach your destination, a cab would then be waiting for you right outside the plane as soon as you got out with all your bags already loaded into the back. \n\nI can see how people get addicted to that lifestyle. I would like to think that if I won the lottery, I would continue to make the \u201csacrifice\u201d of only flying first class. But who knows, like many virtue signaling celebrities I may come up with a flimsy justification like buying carbon credits to offset my travel or something. I hope not.",

Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he\u2019ll empty his pockets for you.\n\nThis is what's happening here. We're being presented with scapegoats we can scoff at, and in the meantime we're using it to also accept that our lifestyles no matter how collectively damaging they are are perfect and are not part of the problem. So the corporations that *provide* that lifestyle are seen as a necessary evil rather than the guys egging us on to continuing to be as destructive and therefore as profitable as possible.\n\nThat's what they're doing. They're convincing you that what you do doesn't matter, so you'll keep doing what you're doing and keep paying money to do so. Because I guarantee you every \"normal\" person changing the way they live, even just a little bit, is going to greatly affect the profit margins of companies, and they don't want that. So instead they convince you that every small change you make is worthless, in the hopes that you'll believe that and just keep doing what you're doing while blaming them with nice, non-profit-harming words. Calling out a company for doing the wrong thing is less effective than even the smallest change. Reducing your plastic usage even just to the tune of five less straws per week is going to hurt big plastic *way* more than still using those straws while saying \"man big plastic sucks\"",

First flight was delayed and eventually canceled, with the airline booking me on another flight the next day. I had to get to the airport 2 hours ahead of my flight and deal with long airport security lines three times on this trip (2x going and one coming back), all while walking long distances carrying bags and taking air trains trying to negotiate a sprawling international airport. Boarding is a mess of people crowding the entrance and they overbook so often it\u2019s now common for them to ask passengers to voluntarily wait for a new flight (for a travel voucher) and gate-check carry ons because they\u2019ve run out of room. Checking bags adds an extra step of waiting at the conveyer belt. Because I don\u2019t get paid time off, and am therefore not paid if I\u2019m home sick, I also am still concerned about catching Covid and you\u2019re trapped in a tube full of people not wearing masks. I fly coach which is pretty uncomfortable on any flights lasting more than a couple hours. I\u2019ve actually elected to drive for hours to other cities rather than deal with the security/boarding/crowds of flying. \n\nI\u2019ve flown private exactly one time, put up by a company that wanted to impress the one I was working for. It was a short trip and was shocked at how much better it actually was; it was similar to calling an Uber in difficulty/hassle.\n\nSo if I had the means to not deal with the hassle all us mere mortals deal with when we travel, particularly when it\u2019s just for work, I\u2019m going to be honest and say I\u2019d likely opt to fly private over Jet Blue out of JFK, so it\u2019d be hypocritical of me to shit on these celebs skipping the bullshit. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t even have to deal with what Spielberg or Taylor Swift would have to being so famous and flying commercially",

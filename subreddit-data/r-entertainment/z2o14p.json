Stan arguably did more to teach people that racism was wrong than many others of his time.  He sent that message right to kids who needed to hear it the most and I think he had a positive impact on society.  And Bill of course makes fun of him when he died because he was some old comic book guy and why should anyone care?\n\nAnd Bill is like this about anyone or anything he disagrees with he just tries to make fun of them.  And worst of all,  he does it badly - he\u2019s not even funny at all.",

He was seemingly the only mainstream voice of reason at that time, on a TV channel that wouldn't hold him back or take him off the air. The problem now is that 9/11 was a generation ago, America's problems today are a direct result of an insane response to it, and the entire comedic and cultural landscape around politics has changed a ton but old Bill hasn't. HBO just needs to take him off the air. We can look at it like Bill changed and he's just an old asshole now, but we changed. The whole world is rightfully more respectful of others for the most part and the low blow jabs that Bill does aren't targeted at the right people anymore. \nTLDR Bill was a great response to George W Bush era politics and 9/11 pro America bullshit.

The great thing was he laughed only at the bits he'd written. He truly defeated the dementia there.\"\n\nThey were also the two who remained the most British, I suppose - John Cleese and Eric Idle lived in America, were very much embraced by American culture, and Terry Gilliam was always American. But both Michael and Terry lived in the UK and did lots of UK television.",

He also loves Zootopia but completely misses the racial inequality message. He loves Star Wars but can't comprehend that the corporations running the galaxy are doing exactly what the corporations in real life are doing.\n\nA lot of my current political beliefs came from a political philosophy class in college. I don't remember the philosophers anymore haha but basically the gist I got from one or two of them is this: what's the point of living in a society if we don't help each other out? The poorest and most disadvantaged people do not benefit from living in this society, so what is the point of it all? We should be striving to make sure everyone is treated equally/equitably and with respect and their needs provided for. I literally do not care that people get welfare or government assistance. I don't care if they \"take advantage.\" They are like that for a reason and I see no problem helping them. Helping people survive and be happier creates a better society for all of us.\n\nMy parents talked shit about my cousin who was on COVID unemployment for longer than was necessary and I honestly just don't get it. She was happy and spending a lot of time with her young kids that she has really struggled with in the past. What's wrong with that? I am happy my tax dollars are going to someone to make their lives better. Because I know all my other tax dollars are going directly in the pockets of evil corporate executives. Everytime the government gives money to the little people, it's a good thing imo. The government/society/taxes SHOULD take care of people. That's literally what it's there for.",

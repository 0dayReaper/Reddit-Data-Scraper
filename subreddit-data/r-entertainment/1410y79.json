Hard to top these characters. The subsequent storylines and their introduced characters haven\u2019t felt nearly as magical.",

Jack Sparrow wasn't a bumbling idiot all the time in the first 3 films, and definitely not in the original movie. He was funny, but he was also clever, smart and had his own motivations. The last few movies haven't had that depth to the characters.",

When the first pirates came out it felt like something entirely new and exciting. Now we get the same movie with a new coat of paint, with less effort and polish. Sometimes with a new name like lone ranger, but still the same. But even if  they released a new movie with excellent effort and polish it still wouldn't be as good as the first ones, because we already have them.",

But it's an amazing character that has gotten old now for me. Batman and Spiderman doesn't rely on that gimmick, but i have gotten quite tired of the superhero genre as well. Just not to the same degree as they don't rely on a gimmick like Jack",

Jack is a spice that makes the dish better. He shouldn\u2019t be the main entree.",

I think Angelica and Philip were compelling characters.\n\nIf I were making a new trilogy, I would include a daughter of Angelica and Jack, a half brother for that daughter, from Jack and someone else, and bring back Anamaria and Philip.\n\nI would structure it as a story where \n\nPart 1: Son of Jack, J. Sparrow (Russell Brand) finds out there is a way to bring his dead father back to life.  He thinks if he accomplishes this, he will be able to escape the shadow of his fathers clown legacy and be treated with respect and sincerity by the world.  (Kinda a reverse Kylo Ren.)  He sails to Barbary Coast to track down an Ifrit/Jinn (sort of a Dracula type villain, Winston Duke.)  Befriended by a helpful Anamaria (who seeks her own freedom from the Ifrit) they set off into Morocco.  In a pivotal final scene, when tempted with using the unlimited power to save his father, he instead falls to the dark side, defeats the Ifrit, and assumes his power and mantel as the leader/worshiped-god of his tribe.\n\nPart 2: Sort of a combination of Fury Road, Rat Race, and Count of Monte Cristo.  Daughter of Jack and Angelica (Diane Guerrero) race against other crews, one helmed by Anamaria (working now for J Sparrow) one helmed by Philip and Syrena, throw in a couple other racers like Ana de Armas and Sofia Barclay cuz they are hot right now.  They all know that J. Sparrow getting it first is the end of the world.  Daughter gets there first, big multi way battle as they chase after her, something something.  Her getting the artifact puts her directly in J Sparrow's crosshairs.\n\nPart 3: each with an artifact (ring, bracelet etc) brother and sister need to outsmart each other to combine the two powers to acomplish either (saving father from death, saving brother from the dark side, can only have one)",

Jack Sparrow was a supporting character, and even when he started to take up more screen time there was enough going on with the *real* story that it was tolerable, if not beneficial. His presence provided levity and enhanced scenes, but that\u2019s because the scenes and storyline didn\u2019t rely on him as a character, he was the sprinkles, not the ice cream. \n\nOnce it became all Jack Sparrow all the time and the original storyline was gone, the quality really dived. Jack Sparrow is not a full enough character to base a movie on. He\u2019s static- he doesn\u2019t change, he doesn\u2019t have an arc, he doesn\u2019t learn lessons, it\u2019s just Jack Sparrow wiggling his hands around and \u201cacting\u201d drunk.

Add a pinch of star crossed lovers in the form of romantic interest Kiera Knightley and you had the recipe for a fun summer blockbuster and the begining of a trilogy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever Johnny Depp stole the show once he came on screen as |Jack Sparrow. The movie wasnt about him but he was so much more interesting. He was funny, erratic, sarcastic and  morally ambiguous. He wasnt a hero or an anti hero he was the fool mocking both sides and taking the prize. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately Disney seeing Jack Sparrows growing popularity decided to focus more on his character. Eventuall he became the protagonist which ruined the original fun of the character.",

            "comment": "Sean Bailey, the president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, recently spoke with the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0to talk about Disney\u2019s live-action projects and one of those projects was\u00a0Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nBailey says restarting the Pirates franchise is a priority at Disney.\u00a0\u201cWe think we have a really good, exciting story that honors the films that have come before but also has something new to say.\u201d\n\nFor those unaware, Disney is actually developing multiple Pirates projects and we highlight each project and share everything we know so far. So let\u2019s set sail and get into the nitty-gritty.\n\nPirates Project #1\n\nBack in 2018, it was reported that\u00a0Deadpool\u00a0and\u00a0Zombieland 2: Double Tap\u00a0writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, were brought on to write\u00a0Pirates 6, but would drop out months later and were replaced by\u00a0Chernobyl\u00a0and\u00a0The Last of Us\u00a0creator Craig Mazin and\u00a0Pirates\u00a0alum Ted Elliot. While there have been no story details or massive updates on this project, it is still the main Pirates project Disney is actively working on. That said, in 2019, we exclusively reported that Guardians of the Galaxy star Karen Gillan was someone Disney was looking at to star. This project will exist in the previous Pirates of the Caribbean movies continuity, so a return from stars Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, Brenton Thwaites, and Kaya Scodelario is definitely on the table.\n\nPirates Project #2\n\nIn 2020, a report surfaced that Harley Quinn herself Margot Robbie would star in a female-led reboot from Bumblebee writer Christina Hodson. This project is not intended to be a spinoff, but a new story, with new characters set in the\u00a0Pirates\u00a0universe. Despite rumors last year that this project was axed, franchise producer Jerry Bruckheimer dispelled that, saying\u00a0\u201cI think that that script will come forward at a certain point. We developed two different stories for Pirates and the other one\u2019s going forward first, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on, to try to get that one made.\u201d The story Bruckheimer is referring to would be the first project we talked about. We had heard when this project was in active development Disney was looking at some pretty big-name actors to star alongside Robbie, names we heard included Jason Momoa, Richard Madden, and Sebastian Stan.\n\nPirates Project #3\n\nA fun piece of information we shared on\u00a0The DisInsider Show\u00a0during our\u00a0\u201cRumor of the Week\u201d\u00a0segment, is that Disney has put a\u00a0Pirates of the Caribbean\u00a0Disney+ on the drawing board and are in very early development stages. At this time, I don\u2019t have any further information on this project as it is still in the early stages.\n\nThe Elephant in the Room\n\nIt\u2019s what everyone wants to know, is Johnny Depp returning to the franchise as Captain Jack Sparrow? A role that garned him an Oscar nomination for his work in Curse of the Black Pearl. Despite\u00a0rumors\u00a0last year that the actor had actually\u00a0closed a deal to appear in a sixth movie\u00a0and that\u00a0he was also planning to help co-write the film, after his very public defamation trial against Amber Heard last year, the actor made it very clear that he would never forgive Disney for the way they publicly distanced themselves from him. Some insiders believe he will return. Bruckheimer told Deadline earlier this year that he would still reach out to Depp because Johnny was both his friend and \u201can amazing artist.\u201d\u00a0Acknowledging that enough time has passed between him, Disney, and Depp, he explained his reasoning by saying,\u00a0\u201cYou go through things in life that you wish you hadn\u2019t done right.\u201d\u00a0Bailey was asked about Depp once again and said \u201cNoncommittal at this point,\u201d\u00a0which is an inkling that a return is very possible.",

If they want to reboot/restart and end up recasting a new Davy Jones or Blackbeard, what's the point, all that will do is draw conclusions to the previous films. Instead they can have stories that predate the originals or occur adjacent to already existing stories, which allows for tiny cameos from previous cast, I can easily picture a young Governor Swan in a brief exchange with one of the new main characters, or even a young Pintel and Ragetti in the background of a bar scene",

They can totally have new stories with new characters in the world and have it feel fresh. They just need a great director and solid writing team. Perhaps the team that made the original (and let them make the movie with minimal studio interference). Bring back Verbinski. Or Gareth Edwards would also be a solid pick I think.

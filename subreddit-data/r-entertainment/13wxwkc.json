Refering to poor or irrelevant past examples to in someway invalidate or shade a current example.\nHe's saying who cares they got it right, they got different shit wrong. That's not how time works, we are allowed to change as a society.\n\nAnd judging one trial against another will always be whataboutism, because the whole point of the justice system is to treat every case as unique and on its own merits. As soon you start comparing cases and outcomes you have completely lost the plot. Even well documented legal precedent needs to be ruled on by judges on a case by case basis.",

At the time, one auditing session was like 1/3 the cost of one therapy session, and you could do it at home with another Scientologist. Now it's 2/3 more expensive, not including the now entirely unaffordable e-meter ($5-6k each), and has to be done at a mission by a trained auditor. Basic classes are like $19, but they get real expensive real quick.\n\nIf you want to advance up the Bridge of Total Freedom, you need serious money, but it's still far more expensive than it was under LRH. It's a major factor in getting people to join the Sea Org. If you do, it's all paid for. In truth, once you join the Sea Org, you won't have any time for any of that. When Clare and Marc Headly left, their \"freeloader bill\" (the cost of all the sessions they got for free while working there) was something like $160,000. They didn't pay it. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)",

I dated a guy in the 90s who\u2019s dad got involved with Scientology and his dad basically signed all the property like his house and business over to them and his mom wouldn\u2019t convert. His dad had a massive heart attack and passed away and since the dad signed over everything the church took everything and his mom and 7 brothers and sisters were all split up and he and 3 of his siblings ended up at the Milton Hershey school and the other kids and mom were all living with different relatives. So basically Scientology ruined his family and left them destitute and split up. He hated them with a passion.",

That allows Reader View. \n\nFrom the article:\n\nActor Danny Masterson was convicted of two counts of rape Wednesday after his second trial on charges that he sexually assaulted several women he met through the Church of Scientology in the early 2000s.\n\nJurors hung on a third count after deliberating for a little more than a week. They contacted Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Charlaine Olmedo around 11 a.m. Wednesday to say that they had reached a verdict on two of the three rape counts against Masterson but that were hopelessly deadlocked on a third.\n\nJurors previously hung on all counts against Masterson during a trial in late 2022.\n\nThe courtroom was packed with a mix of Masterson\u2019s relatives and supporters and other observers. The actor\u2019s wife, Bijou Phillips, let out a pained cry shortly after the verdict was read and began sobbing.\n\nMost of the allegations against Masterson aired in the roughly two-week trial first surfaced in 2017. The victims \u2014 identified in court as Chrissy B., Jen B. and N. Trout \u2014 were all practicing Scientologists when they met Masterson through the church.\n\nJurors convicted Masterson of sexually assulting Jen B. and N. Trout but were unable to reach a verdict on the allegations against Chrissy B.\n\nTwo of the women said they waited more than a decade to come forward because church officials discouraged them from contacting law enforcement, leaving them in the impossible situation of choosing between their faith and accountability for the man who allegedly raped them.\n\nAll of the women had relatives in Scientology and feared they would be excommunicated and labeled \u201csuppressive persons\u201d if they went against Masterson and the church.\n\nScientology officials have repeatedly denied prohibiting members from cooperating with police. But after a 2021 preliminary hearing, L.A. Superior Court Judge Charlaine Olmedo ruled that the church has \u201can expressly written doctrine\u201d that discourages members from reporting one another to law enforcement. The church has said Olmedo\u2019s interpretation is incorrect.\n\nAll of the women described falling prey to Masterson after he served them drinks that made them disoriented and nauseous. Phillip Cohen, one of Masterson\u2019s defense attorneys, has repeatedly noted that prosecutors have zero forensic evidence to prove the victims were drugged.\n\nChrissy B. said she endured a tumultuous and abusive relationship with Masterson where he repeatedly spit on her, called her \u201cwhite trash\u201d and initiated sex with her while she was asleep. She alleged that in November 2021, she awoke to Masterson forcing himself on her. When she said no, he struck her, pinned her down and raped her, she testified.\n\nShe also alleged that she lost consciousness after Masterson served her a drink at La Poubelle restaurant in Franklin Village in 2001, waking up the next morning in serious pain at the actor\u2019s Hollywood Hills home. Masterson told her they had sex, to her horror, according to a letter she wrote to a Scientology official that was presented at trial.\n\nJen B. described becoming weak and woozy after having a drink with Masterson, who she said brought her to his home and violently raped her, wielding a gun and suffocating her with a pillow. N. Trout described a similar experience, saying that Masterson isolated her at his house once she grew weak. She alleged he groped her and digitally penetrated her in a shower before raping her so violently that she vomited.\n\nMasterson has denied all wrongdoing. He did not testify at either trial, and his attorneys did not put forth a defense at the second trial. But across his cross-examinations and arguments, Cohen repeatedly noted that the prosecution had no way to corroborate any of the assaults and no evidence of drugging, while questioning if the victims were motivated by a bias against the church rather than anything Masterson had done.\n\nThe church has loomed large over the proceedings. In addition to the women\u2019s allegations that Scientology officials discouraged them from reporting the rapes to police, the revelation that a church attorney obtained discovery materials in the case has sparked an LAPD investigation and allegations of impropriety from prosecutors.\n\nThe materials obtained by attorney Vicki Podberesky included redacted text messages exchanged between Masterson\u2019s accusers and LAPD investigators, according to Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Reinhold Mueller.\n\nA hearing to determine how Podberesky got the materials was set to take place Wednesday morning but was rescheduled by Olmedo because deliberations were ongoing. Podberesky said last month that she got the documents legally and did nothing wrong but declined to explain how they came into her possession.",

How can someone be convicted of a crime when there is no physical or forensic evidence proving that 1. a crime was even committed and 2. who actually committed the crime? I am not saying Danny was innocent but I am just confused on how people can be convicted only based on someone else accusing them of something without any proof or actual physical evidence. I just worry that this could set a scary precedence where truly innocent people could be convicted only based on something someone said. There was a lot of inconsistency in their testimonies as well and they are saying he did something 20 years ago with no proof or evidence. A court of law supposed to find someone guilty without a reasonable doubt but shouldn't the fact that there is no physical/forensic evidence be reasonable doubt?",

Courts in real life don't functional at all like on TV; most convictions aren't made on physical evidence but by examining eye witness testimony, how well each witness's testimony corroborates other witness testimony, and if opposing counsel can find inconsistencies etc. Masterson's lawyers didn't even try to put up a defense on the second trial, and Masterson himself did not testify for either- those were all decisions they made of their own volition, probably because Masterson would have inevitably incriminated himself (typically why someone does not testify in their own defense).",

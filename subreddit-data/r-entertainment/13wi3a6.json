Jam Master Jay didn\u2019t get killed for making music, he was killed over a missing shipment of cocaine supplied by the largest domestic drug organization in the country at the time. And they didn\u2019t even explicitly put a hit on him, the other guys with him who were involved in the same deal killed him in order to make it right so they could receive more drug shipments in the future. Jam Master Jay was a music producer from Queens, that\u2019s all he knew. Why at almost 40 y/o are you going to get involved with a drug gang thats so large it stretches from Detroit to Atlanta?",

They were founded in Detroit but they recruited members from damn near every city. With their major hubs and more prominent members being in Atlanta and Los Angeles. They were probably the largest and most successful domestic drug trafficking operation ever. And an interesting case as well, they weren\u2019t known for the crazy violence that you usually see in that world. They united Bloods and Crips in LA, stopped drug turf wars in Atlanta and even invested in a good bit of the hip hop labels that were growing at that time. Their whole thing was uniting different guys from different gangs and crews for the purposes of making as much money as possible together",

But yeah they didn\u2019t kill him but from what I\u2019ve read it seems like they kinda told those guys they needed to handle it if they wanted to do any future deals with them. And I guess they took \u201chandle it\u201d to mean killing JMJ. I could see it playing out like that, BMF was so big they didn\u2019t need to actually kill people themselves. They knew that other folks would take care of problems for them just to get in good with them. I was in between Detroit and Atlanta back when they were around and that\u2019s basically how they moved. Very much a soft power approach",

Although a couple of his first documentary work was on Australian free to air TV, once he got some exposure, the majority of episodes only on pay TV for most of its run (before the days of p2p piracy). Most Australian's only exposure was [bombastic comedy bits](https://youtu.be/wtjWpTUipOM) on free to air talk shows.\n\nYears along from his death, being able to see more YouTube clips than I ever saw his show, my perspective has shifted, I can separate out the cringe showmanship and see the genuine warmth he had for all creatures. When I see a lizard sunning itself, have Steve's voice in my head, \"oi, look at this beauty!\"\n\nI would much rather his face on a note... but *not* with a croc, but holding a creature on our present day endanger species list that he'd want to draw attention to, say a [corroboree frog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corroboree_frog)... \n\nthen we can also say Charles is on the note, he's the frog",

Anyone who's not familiar should check out some of the episodes, there's a lot of myth around him now.\n\nI remember him getting attacked by animals a lot, like one episode particularly he was talking about how this cobra is dangerous so you shouldn't get near it, so he picked it up and it bit him in the face. My Dad is involved with animals in a very similar way but particularly focused on marine studies. His opinion as a professional is that Steve definitely fucked with that Ray. My dad's been around them a LOT and it's getting attacked by a prey animal.\n\nHe became far more popular after his passing, than he was while alive. And it became straight up taboo to even talk about him in anything other than a purely positive way for years. Only in the last 1-2 years have I seen people genuinely expressing how they saw him.\n\nEither way, he did a hell of a lot for Aussie wildlife and awareness. His Zoo is fantastic, and his family all seem like really genuine people. But the truth is, he was a bit of an idiot who fucked around with dangerous animals and found out.",

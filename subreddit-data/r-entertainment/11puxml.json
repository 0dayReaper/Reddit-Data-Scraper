And then when you add creative directors who aren't afraid to delve into absolutely insane tangents for the sake of the multiverse storyline, you get stuff like Ratacoonie, a whole reality where Ratatouille is real, but with a raccoon.  Of the people I've talked to about it, some love the off-the-rails plotline and absurd alternate realities and for others, those exact things are why they thought it was just okay.\n\nI'd say the closest comparison is probably Kung Fu Hustle, but KFH doesn't have the same emotional impact in its story, IMO.",

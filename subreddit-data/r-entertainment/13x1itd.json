            "comment": "&gt; CNN \u2014 Actor Armie Hammer will not face charges following an investigation by Los Angeles police into an allegation of sexual assault against the actor, the LA District Attorney\u2019s Office told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n&gt;\u201cSexual assault cases are often difficult to prove, which is why we assign our most experienced prosecutors to review them. In this case, those prosecutors conducted an extremely thorough review, but determined that at this time, there is insufficient evidence to charge Mr. Hammer with a crime,\u201d Tiffiny Blacknell, Director of the Bureau of Communications told CNN.\n\n&gt;\u201cAs prosecutors, we have an ethical responsibility to only charge cases that we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt. We know that it is hard for women to report sexual assault. Even when we cannot move forward with a prosecution, our victim service representatives will be available to those who seek our victim support services. Due to the complexity of the relationship and inability to prove a non-consensual, forcible sexual encounter we are unable to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\n&gt;Hammer posted a statement to Instagram following the news:\n\n&gt;\u201cI am very grateful to the District Attorney for conducting a thorough investigation and coming to the conclusion that I have stood by this entire time, that no crime was committed. I look forward to beginning what will be a long, difficult process of putting my life back together now that my name is cleared.\u201d\n\n&gt;The LAPD opened an investigation into the matter in February 2021, after a woman, identified by her attorney at the time as Effie, accused him of raping her in 2017.\n\n&gt;Hammer was not charged in the case and has denied any wrongdoing, at the time saying through his attorney that the allegation was \u201coutrageous\u201d and that his interactions with the woman and other partners have been \u201ccompletely consensual, discussed and agreed upon in advance, and mutually participatory.\u201d\n\n&gt;CNN reported last month that the Los Angeles District Attorney\u2019s Office was reviewing claims of sexual assault made against the actor. They did not specify the identity of the complainant or complainants.\n\n&gt;In a statement made on Wednesday to CNN following the DA\u2019s decision, Effie said in part, \u201cI am disappointed with the LA County District Attorney\u2019s decision not to prosecute Armie Hammer. I felt a duty to speak out and file a report in order to try to hold Armie accountable for all the harm and trauma he has caused me and in order to protect other women from experiencing similar abuse.\u201d",

But the media made a huge deal out of this story so he didn't get a chance to work here even if he wanted. As for disappearing - he didn't, he was pretty much in LA and was papped a couple of times here during last year.",

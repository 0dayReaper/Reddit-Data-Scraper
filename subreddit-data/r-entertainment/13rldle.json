I kept those DVDs for a while. \n\nThere has not been another show with the attention to detail to Roman culture as that show. Beyond the absolutely killing performances and the incredible writing, the production and realism was amazing.  The dimension of the cities was accurate for the time. The framing of the scenes allowed you to enjoy the context, as opposed to just focus on the over-sensationalized bodies or fighting scenes, like in Spartacus. \n\nAnd yes, while it was sad that it ended in Season 2; after seeing what happened with GOT, I think they did the right thing. \n\nOne of my all time favorite shows.",

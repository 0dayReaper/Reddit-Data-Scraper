If anything, your story is anecdotal. 5150 wasn\u2019t something legislated to function in the capacity it did for you.\n\nIt was designed to detain and get help immediately for people who are about to or are thinking about doing something that could hurt, injure or kill. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve been in one of those places. There is nothing stigmatizing about what I said. If I had said \u201cyeah only crazy fucks get 5150d\u201d then I\u2019d totally agree.\n\nMentally well people can catch it too, addicts catch it. You don\u2019t have to have a mental illness to be 5150\u2019d technically. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like bam hasn\u2019t had plenty of his homies from jackass offer to help get him in. If I was serious about getting clean I\u2019d take the offer from Steve o and go into a nice kush rehab. Not a ward basically where they will heavily medicate you, is state funded (and underfunded) and usually your sharing space with other people who are unpredictable. \n\nFew weeks ago he was having a public meltdown in a bathrobe yelling at his wife in front of his child. He is not well. \n\nI think with all this in mind, this wasn\u2019t bam going \u201coh jeeze I gotta get help, there\u2019s no one available, ill 5150 myself\u201d. And more like he melted down or threatened people or himself.",

I understand the reasoning behind having an \"all or nothing\" approach to treatment, especially for the organisations doing the rehabilitation work, but that statistic getting thrown around as often as it doesn't probably hurts more than it helps and may discourage those who are in/need treatment from ever trying to improve themselves because \"why bother, rehab only has a 10% success rate.\"",

Every time someone tries to get sober, they get better at it. So statistically speaking, every time someone tries, they get more likely to achieve sobriety. And I think that\u2019s encouraging! The other stats say about 1 out of 13 people will maintain sobriety. But, again, it improves over time, with treatment, and continued attempts. \n\nGetting sober is really really hard! But, it is possible! Statistics for people becoming professional athletes are much smaller, yet many people work for and desire that outcome for their lives. Being a rock star or actor is similar- yet people aren\u2019t dissuaded by those odds. Or the lottery. People know it\u2019s very unlikely they\u2019ll become a millionaire, yet tons and tons of people try. So it\u2019s all in how you look at it.",

My roommate's beers are in the fridge and I don't ever think about them.  The word \"alcoholic\" has a meaning, and alcoholics can't do the things I do.  I am a recovered alcoholic who will stay that way as long as I maintain a certain level of spiritual health, and it's not hard to do that.

The fact he came back from how deep in addiction he was is nothing short of a straight miracle. It\u2019s so crazy hearing that old radio bam episode where Bam kicked him out for heroin and calling him a lousy junky is just so surreal after how everything ended up. The pendulum swings both ways indeed.",

No joke I think when the Jackass Team were in their prime everybody pretty much expected Steve-O to be an early death with how wild he was. \n\nThe fact he of all people was able to buckle down and put in the work to get serious meant he not only grew as a person himself but is in a unique position where he can actually offer 1st hand experience about it.\n\nAnd him saying that about Bam after everything he did to try and help him to me shows that Steve-O has just accepted that Bam at this stage is most likely a lost cause (I genuinely hope I\u2019m wrong) and doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility for someone who clearly hasn\u2019t been interested in helping himself.",

The people he\u2019s surrounding himself with including his family to some degree are simply coddling him. Like maybe it\u2019s just me, but if one of my closest friends was acting like that and I did everything I could to genuinely help them and they are still refusing, they are either completely lost or need a reality check. \n\nAnd the thing is, as much as I WANT to feel sorry and have sympathy for Bam I just can\u2019t anymore, not when what he\u2019s doing is actively going to hurt his son\u2019s childhood and relationship with him. Speaking as someone who comes from a life where I never knew who my biological father was, being a kid and wandering why your own dad chose to do drugs or party or whatever instead of being there for you is one of the most painful things a person can go through. More than any drug cause that shit STICKS with you for life.\n\nI will continue to hold out hope for the guy cause I used to watch him when I was growing up, but the dude has lost all respect. Threatening to smoke crack until he\u2019s dead unless his ex-wife gives up her son to him\u2026.like seriously Bam\u2026",

Then mix Dunns death with an already unhealthy/dangerous drug abuse problem and you get the train wreck that is his existence now.. CTE is a possibility, but not required to be explain his downfall. Not to mention, drug abuse changes brain chemistry and alters neuro-pathways, and it\u2019s an area that isn\u2019t really understood yet. Also, the drug cocktail he\u2019s been exposing himself too sounds broad and extensive. Who knows what he\u2019s done to himself neurologically. I only bring this up because people see dangerous behavior and personality changes, and immediately think CTE. It severely undermines the very real dangers of heavy, heavy drug use. Physical trauma isn\u2019t the only way brain damage can happen.",

I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic so I can definitely sympathize with Bam\u2019s addiction problems. I mean Steve O was acting like a complete loony tune, but he cleaned up and got his head on straight. \n\nI remember reading something a while back about how Bam has had some severe head trauma, a few times as a teenager, while skateboarding and obviously a few concussions during his Jackass days. It just seems like even when he\u2019s sober for lengths of time he just has that thousand yard stare like he\u2019s not fully coherent and understanding what\u2019s happening around him. I was just theorizing maybe his head trauma might have something to do with his behavior, as he exhibits some symptoms of it (doesn\u2019t mean he has it of course). \n\nI didn\u2019t mean to downplay his addiction though, and I agree CTE isn\u2019t required to explain his downfall; his problems are self inflicted by his alcohol and drug abuse. Also exacerbated by Dunn\u2019s death and other external factors like you mentioned.",

I'll never judge someone for how long it takes them to process the death of someone that close to them. \n\nI think if a therapist really dived into why he wants to drink himself into an early grave it'd be unprocessed trauma from that event.\n\nThe dude was rich as hell, relatively young, lived an adrenaline junkie lifestyle, and had every drug connection you could imagine. It's a recepie for disaster. \n\nHe's killing himself, and I don't believe people kill themselves for no reason at all. There's gotta be a root cause to his addictions and addressing that might be the only way for him to kick it for good",

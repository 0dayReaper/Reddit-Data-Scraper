The last regime thought we as an audience were to stupid to have two different interpretation at once but Gunn seems to have a little more faith in the audience.",

I am happy to get another season rather than a flat out cancellation.\n\nThis is my favorite live action version of Clark/Superman. He is so wholesome and Midwestern. You look at him and think, \"I bet he gives the best hugs.\" That's how Superman should be. James Gunn wants his Superman to be all about hope and kindness. Well, he has a great example in this show.",

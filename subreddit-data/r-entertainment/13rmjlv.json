            "comment": "No one could have blamed Universal studio mogul Donna Langley and her team for wanting to take a joy ride when\u00a0Fast X\u00a0opened to $251.5 million overseas, the biggest international launch of 2023 to date, besting\u00a0The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u00a0and\u00a0Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It set franchise records in key markets including Japan, India, Brazil and Indonesia. And it\u2019s one of the few recent Hollywood movies to resonate in China, where it started off with $77.1 million.\n\nThe\u00a0box office\u00a0in North America is a different matter, where the car-racing franchise has been slowing down since the record-breaking start of 2017\u2019s\u00a0The Fate of the Furious. While the series has done most of its business overseas, domestic still matters.\n\nThere\u2019s only one more movie planned \u2014\u00a0Fast X Part II\u00a0\u2014 before Universal pulls over and bids goodbye to the core franchise, although insiders say there\u2019s plenty of gas left in the tank for potential spinoffs.\n\nThe studio has been consistent when it comes to this point, although star Vin Diesel may have confused some when suggesting at the latest movie\u2019s Rome premiere that there could be a\u00a0Fast &amp; Furious 12\u00a0that would serve as the final title in a trilogy.\n\nThe franchise hit its pinnacle when 2015\u2019s\u00a0Furious 7\u00a0took in $1.51 billion at the global box office, fueled by $1.16 billion earned internationally and $353 million domestically.\n\nTwo years later, the\u00a0Fate of the Furious\u00a0topped out at $1.23 billion, including $1 billion internationally and $226 million domestically.\u00a0F9: The Fast Saga\u00a0\u2014 which came out in 2021 during the difficult days of the pandemic \u2014 grossed $726 million globally after earning $173 million domestically and $553 million\u202foverseas.\u00a0\n\nDomestically, the 10th installment received a B+ CinemaScore, the same as\u00a0Fast 9. Like its predecessors, the pic is notable for playing to an ethnically diverse audience. Caucasians and Hispanics each made up 29\u202fpercent of U.S. ticket buyers, followed by African Americans (21 percent), Asians (12 percent) and Native American/Other (8 percent), per PostTrak.\n\nFast X\u00a0cost at least $300 million to make \u2014 due in part to pandemic delays \u2014 and hopes to get to $800 million worldwide. Like previous installments, it is on course to see international grosses dominate.\n\nThe film is one of the few recent Hollywood releases to resonate in China, where it opened to an impressive $78.3 million after drawing storn audience scores. Other territory highlights: it took a sizable $16.7 million in Mexico, followed by France ($9.7 million), Brazil ($9.6 million), India ($8.6 million), Indonesia ($8.4 million), Germany ($8 million), the U.K. ($7.6 million) and South Korea ($6.7 million). And it scored a franchise-best $7 million in Japan, where 93.6 percent of moviegoers said they would recommend the pic to others.\n\nSays Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian, \u201cFast X, by generating around 80\u202fpercent of its opening weekend outside of North America, demonstrates the smart business decision and enduring box office legacy of taking the characters and storyline into the international arena.\u201d",

So if it's decriminalized at the federal level it *should* nullify the issue.\n\nThe employer in question was Dish, which had to deal with federal law in the course of normal business (FCC). I would expect that any employer with strong federal ties (money, oversight) would need to adhere to federal law. It's not great, but it is what it is.\n\nIf pot gets decriminalized then a lot of this goes away.",

Granted he was only 19 or so at the time so even though weed was legal in Cali and Colorado you still have to be 21. But still, he forgot a bowl in his car and it completely fucked his life plans.

Politicians would ideally vote with their party, assuming that vote aligns with their voters\u2019 interests. \n\nFor example, the GOP supported overturning Roe v Wade. A republican politician (especially a personally pro-life one) could vote along party lines and also oppose it. However, even republican voters generally opposed repealing Roe (based on polling), so in this case the politician would be voting *against* their constituents\u2019 interests.\n\nBasically I vote for a politician to represent me and my values. Even if that conflicts with their personal beliefs, I would argue they should still vote in line with the voters\u2019 views because that\u2019s what they were elected for.",

Was secret until it\u2019s discovery during  Obama\u2019s 1st  term. \n\n[Shocking new details of US STD experiments in Guatemala Fresh revelations about 1940s medical tests come to light, including deliberately exposing people to sexually transmitted diseases](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/30/guatemala-experiments) \n\n\nFrom Article \n\nThey revealed that some of the experiments were more shocking than was previously known.\n\nFor example, seven women with epilepsy, who were housed at Guatemala's Asilo de Alienados (Home for the Insane), were injected with syphilis below the back of the skull, a risky procedure. The researchers thought the new infection might somehow help cure epilepsy. The women each got bacterial meningitis, probably as a result of the unsterile injections, but were treated.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing details involved a female syphilis patient with an undisclosed terminal illness. The researchers, curious to see the impact of an additional infection, infected her with gonorrhea in her eyes and elsewhere. Six months later she died.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the torture program that\u2019s a completely different story and rabbit hole to go down.",

Sure, but this idea she's some hardliner that needs to atone for some gross conduct doesn't hold up.

She went on to co-sponsor a 2019 version of the bill. \n\nIn 2019, Harris co-sponsored a bill aimed at protecting past drug offenders from losing access to public housing.

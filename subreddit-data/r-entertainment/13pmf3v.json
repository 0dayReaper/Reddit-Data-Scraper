I grew up watching him and he was always seen as this wholesome guy like Bob Ross or Bill Cosby.\n\nAnd then like Bill Cosby we found out that he was not wholesome at all, He ended up being charged with child sex offences - it wasnt until 2013 that he was brought if for questioning, guy was already 83 at the time so it was a shock to find out so late.",

I was sooo bummed that I had to miss the legend himself. Then like 5 minutes later we all learned what kind of scum bag he was. Probably one of the few times in my life I got to retroactively cleanse regret like that.",

Hospitals used to invite Saville, literally give him a set of keys and let him fuck young sick vulnerable kids. Hundreds of them over many years. All this while he enjoyed the fame of a top BBC celebrity. There is a documentary too. \n\nEnjoy!",

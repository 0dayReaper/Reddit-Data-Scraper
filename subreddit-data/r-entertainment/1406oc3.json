            "comment": "For those interested, this was fully expected, as the DGA historically cuts lesser deals with the AMPTP to the detriment of other unions.\n\nThe WGA has said repeatedly that unlike 07-08, they plan to take the fight further than the DGA, pushing on issues that the latter relented on. The DGA made some movement, but much like in past years, the \"groundbreaking\" wage gains don't even keep up with inflation, nor have they made much headway with streaming residuals or transparency, essentially tying wages gained to subscribers rather than viewership - and a far lower level. The timing of this was also very purposeful, with the studios hoping to offset the strike authorization for SAG-AFTRA. Their biggest \"win\" outside of foreign is probably establishing a precedent for AI, along with payment for the months leading up to production. SAG is after what the WGA is for the most part, so it's more interesting to see if they strike in solidarity. \n\nEither way, if you see folks claiming that this hurts the strike or should end it prematurely, that's misinformation. It's really the other way around, with the strike having created leverage for them.",

If the unions stood together, the AMPTP would lose a lot of leverage. \n\nDGA taking this deal \u2014 with pay raises barely equal to inflation \u2014 hardly has any translatable \u201cwins\u201d for other unions. The timing of this announced deal seems meant to put pressure on SAG-AFTRA, whose members will be doing a strike authorization vote this week. That SAV needs to be high (like 90%) to demonstrate they\u2019re united. Otherwise, the AMPTP will sense weakness and SAG-AFTRA may also have to deal with lesser terms while WGA is still waiting and ignored. \n\nBut if SAG-AFTRA strike, then pressure is back on the AMPTP to actually come up with meaningful negotiation points. If that happens, both of those unions\u2019 strikes would likely end relatively close to each other.",

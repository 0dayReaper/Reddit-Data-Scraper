There's a weird hair sex thing, but they also do the weird hair sex thing with animals.\n2. The plot is basically Fern Gully or Pocahontas.\n\nI don't think anyone goes to see Avatar for the plot or the characters. They go for the spectacle.",

Sci-fi/fantasy is easy to just go kinda nuts with, ending up with a big inconsistent soup of disparate ideas. I thought the Avatar movies were fine, visually fucking mind blowing (especially the sequel in IMAX 3D good god) but overall just\u2026 fine. But the world always felt extremely well resolved, like ok, this place FEELS like it exists, it\u2019s all cohesive, it all has this crazy wild shit feeling somehow reasonable and grounded. That\u2019s the real advantage of lore. I\u2019ve worked on some projects that had literal tomes of lore with probably 5% of it making it into the final product in any clearly visible way. But it all helps inform the choices made behind and in front of the camera.",

Granted I \u201clearned\u201d these things when I was young, now that I\u2019m older and know a little more I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s actually just two different responses to traumatic situations and adrenaline just happens to be present in those instances and is not the driving factor. The first being that you are in high stress and your brain just edits the worst of it out and represses it. The second being that the trauma sears the events into your brain. IDK I\u2019m not a doctor. \n\nAlternatively I\u2019ll submit, there have been times in my life where I was so caught up in \u201cwaiting\u201d for the best part of an event that I never actually experienced the event. The best way to stop it for me is to try and take a \u201csnapshot\u201d of a moment when I realize that and it give me an anchor point to recall/remember the event later. An example I could give is I hardly remember either of my graduations because I was waiting for them to \u201cget good\u201d or be something or feel something, but I remember quite clearly a agonizingly boring award ceremony from when I was in the 7th grade that was basically the same thing as a graduation and I remember all of my cousins and friends graduations. It\u2019s kind of like waiting to record on a vhs tape a show and trying to skip the commercials in the recording, you\u2019re holding the stop button and trying to time it so you get as little commercial as possible but sometimes you forget to press start and miss chunks of the show with it. Seems like maybe waiting for \u201cthe best\u201d moment they don\u2019t record/remember huge chunks of the show.",

Obviously putting your phone in peoples view for minutes on end is rude, but that\u2019s a self awareness issue not a phone one.

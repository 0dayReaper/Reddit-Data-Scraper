He enjoyed one of my friends meals so much that he asked for it for the 3 nights he was there and asked to meet my friend so he could thank him for a unique meal. So the only personal story I know of Jonny Depp is that he treats hotel staff well and shows gratitude and appreciation. That sounds pretty decent to me.",

He sat at his table for hours meeting fans. When it was my friend's turn, she froze and started crying. Johnny consoled her, signed her stuff, took a picture with her, gave her a hug and complimented her Cry Baby shirt. He spent around 2 minutes with her, which was more than everyone else got cuz his security had to keep the line moving. I too think he's a decent person. He genuinely cares about his fans.",

But from what I\u2019ve seen of her, her interactions with Weinstein, her backtracking once it all came out about him. It\u2019s just very questionable as to why she\u2019s so popular. There\u2019s no doubt she can act, but if you think Harvey didn\u2019t help her career somewhat you\u2019re insane. \n\nThen there\u2019s alleged story he\u2019s told about having sex with her, you can take that for what it is from him, a guy with an ego and a track record like that doesn\u2019t need to lie about who he had sex with to forward a career. He\u2019s that ego drunk he\u2019ll tell the truth in that regard I think.\n\nThen she\u2019s repeatedly defend David Orussel for his antics and how he approaches filmmaking with actors, he apparently reduced Amy Adams to tears until Bale came to her defence. The also groped his niece and has a slew of other scandals. It was always hinted JL and Orussel were more than friends. Same again when she starred in Mother! Except this time it was common knowledge she was in a relationship with the director. \n\nAgain if there was concrete evidence of anything with her, it would definitely be a different story. I remember there being a story alleging that the nude photos that leaked of her were sent to hollywood exec (could\u2019ve been Harvey). I have no doubt that scumbag raped a lot of women, but to say no person ever traded their body willingly knowing they\u2019d get something out of it is insane. \n\nAnd given how close she seems with him in their television appearances, how he\u2019s spoken of her and others, I think she gladly did him that favour. Like many other people around him who blew smoke up his ass one minute and then acted like they knew all along the next. \n\nI got too much time on my hands atm lol",

The key is documentation.\n\nDepp was smart to record evidence of her actions and behaviour. \n\nSomething I've seen in the years I worked in addictions and mental health and being on the receiving end of abuse is this:\n\nAbusers never take responsibility for their actions. It's always the other person's fault. You'll hear them make comments like \"It's not my fault, you know that makes me angry.\" Or \"you shouldn't have done that.\" You get the drill. Abusers will often lay blame on others or on past traumas.\n\nDocument everything. Dates and times of when incidents occur. Collect eye witness statements if there any.\n\nAlso know that emotional abuse is very real. Amber sounds like a real piece of work.",

Note that Depp seemed \"pleased\" with the outcome.  \n  \nAccording to a [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/johnny-depp-earpiece) interview, the earpiece was for \"disturbing noises\" to help him \"emote better\". Possibly a weak defense, sure, but actors have been known to take in odd affectations to help prepare for or maintain roles.  \n  \nAnd old [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/johnny-depp-a-star-crisis-insane-story-his-missing-millions-1001513) found people talking about Depp being on the set of PotC 5, which started filming in February 2015. \"Still, sources close to the production report tales of excessive drinking, physical fights with Heard and constant lateness on set, which often left hundreds of extras waiting for hours at a time.\" That seems (as best I can tell) when the rumours of Depp always being drunk or dickish in set really started.\n  \nNow, the only reason I'm really pointing this all out would be because this all came out in 2017. Which was the year Depp and Heard *divorced*.  \n  \nThey got married *February 3rd, 2015* (after living together since 2011) and divorced in January of 2017.  When Heard filed for divorce, she accused Depp of being [abusive](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/16/entertainment/amber-heard-johnny-depp-timeline/) and asked for a restraining order.\n  \nSo... Here's how it could be framed: after Depp and Heard got married, she became abusive towards him. He may have already had a problem with addiction, sure, but that would have made him *more vulnerable and manipulatable* to an abuser. This carried over to his work, terribly. After the divorce was finalized *and alimony settled*, stories came out painting Depp as an addicted abuser.\n  \nI think he may have a damned good case for defamation. People have casually (not consciously) seemed to view his actions in a darker light directly because of her claims and accusations.",

I'm from Kentucky and have a really slight accent - but whenever these wannabes find out where I am from they go full on the offensive about how bad my accent is and basically imply that I must be stupid, while they sound like they came straight from the cornfield on Hee Haw. The whole thing is baffling.\n\nAlso I grew up in a middle of nowhere, rural community where basically everyone farmed. Pretty much nobody I knew did it because it was fun or cool. Usually it was a hard, dead end life and most of them got out at the first opportunity. It is not a glamorous profession by any means and it's always so bizarre to hear people with no clue, putting it on some pedestal as the best thing ever to drive a tractor or party in a cornfield.",

The guy dressed in drag and showed his ass on MTV was a character that he has slowly dialed down over the years because he realized being a guy in your 60s perving on women in their 20s is gross and not really funny. \n\nHe also had George Takei as the announcer of the show and always had on Richard Simmons who went to Gary's wedding and cried like a baby at how happy he was for him. Howard is a real one IMO and would make fun of anyone and did what we all claim to want and that is \"to be treated equally\". Plus the guy constantly talks about how small his dick is and how ugly he is.",

That\u2019s not a coincidence.\n  \nThe GOP playbook always needs a boogeyman, and the criteria for that boogeyman is very specific. It has to be a very small minority that doesn\u2019t have enough power to fight back and is very different than the average GOP\u2019er. In such a way that the classic \u201cthey will change our way of life\u201d fear tactic can be used. Homosexuals, Latino immigrants, Muslims, sharia law, communists, socialists, satanists, BLM, Antifa, hippies, gangs, were all boogeymen, and now it\u2019s trans people.\n  \nBut why trans people now? Because the boogeyman can only be a boogeyman for so long until they either find a way to fight back, or the general population doesn\u2019t care anymore. Remember the sharia law panic? That one was good for them because it was a boogeyman that was far away in Michigan. Easy to instill fear in people when you don\u2019t see evidence to the contrary in your own town. These scary people can one day be in your town with their archaic religious laws! But, over time, when that doesn\u2019t actually happen or even start to happen, people will realize that you\u2019re full of shit if you don\u2019t distract them with a new boogeyman. The only boogeyman to stand the test of time is Latino immigrants, but immigrants in general are the low hanging fruit of boogeymen.\n  \nBut why do it at all? Why do they even need boogeymen? Because the GOP doesn\u2019t actually represent conservatives, it represents corporations. They use fear mongering and boogeymen to not only distract from real issues, but get conservatives to vote against their own best interest and in the best interests of the private sector. By using identity politics they frame issues as us vs them. Socialized healthcare all of a sudden becomes a bad thing only because THEY want it, and you don\u2019t want to be like them. \n  \nAbortion was a major factor in this because what are you gonna do, vote for a democrat who\u2019s okay with people killing babies? But you can\u2019t make that argument for decades and have it still be a problem, otherwise people lose faith that anything could be done and the topic no longer holds any sway. So, if I had to put money on it, the GOP focused on putting in justices to overturn Roe because they though it would charge up their base. Like \u201csee, it was a problem but we fixed it, now let\u2019s go fix other problems\u201d but they didn\u2019t expect the backlash they got. \n  \nSo in short the GOP and their media wing always needs a new boogeyman to instill fear in their followers, and trans people were just next on the list.",

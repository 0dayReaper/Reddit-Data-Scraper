Can't turn a blind eye to it anymore when they're advertising their own shittiness all over their own social media, thinking it makes them down to earth or interesting, when really it just grosses people out and exposes how out of touch they are.\n\nI don't really hate celebs for what they are, I think it's wrong to punish people who've worked hard for their success. It's true that many had it handed to them, but it's still hard work despite the insane rewards. Regardless many of them seem like genuinely disgusting, awful people that I would not want to know in real life. Others seem fine, but we never really know if that's just a skilfully managed persona.",

She was still an heiress to the Hilton fortune.\n\nNow - if memory and time line serves, it was this sort of shenanigan and fuckery that led to grandfather BARRON disowning her and the family and announcing that he was giving 97% of his fortune to Charity.\n\nThat may be when she turned around and said I'll stop fighting if you cut me in for a piece'\n\nThe timing of the 'leak' (2 weeks before her show dropped) was certainly suspect but that was probably due to Solomon to help him sell his deal.\n\nAs I recall, that video did a lot of business. LOTS.  my guess is it made upwards of $20 million. Some source say more.\n\n\"One Night in Paris\" received AVN Awards in 2005 for \"Best Selling Title of the Year,\" \"Best Renting Title of the Year\" and \"Best Overall Marketing Campaign \u2014 Individual Project.\"\n\nhttps://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/paris-hilton-isnt-really-much-heiress/",

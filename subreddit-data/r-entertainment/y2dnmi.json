With all the liquidated cash every party will receive a % of the liquidated cash but higher priority debts will receive a higher %. \n\nIt is highly unlikely that he would be able to just transfer his current assets to hide them as this is highly illegal and easily detectable by the bankruptcy authorities. \n\nThe liquidated cash is split among the parties he owes(chapter 7 bankruptcy). A judge can also order garnishment of wages/ repayment plan (chapter 5/13 bankruptcy) if he has a large income and believes he can pay back his debts over 5 years. The garnished amount will depend on his income and living expenses.\n\nHowever, there may be statutory damage caps (depending on the state) which would see the ordered amount to be paid to be significantly reduced.   If he can afford the reduced amount, he just pays and goes on his way.",

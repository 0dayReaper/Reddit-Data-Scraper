He skips school to have a fun day tooling around Chicago with his two best friends. They go to a fucking art museum! If it were a typical teenage comedy he'd have been smoking weed and getting drunk like 30 minutes into it. He's like \"what if we go chill at the stock exchange\".\n\nMatthew Broderick seems like the kind of low key personality that would do that shit too, it works very well for performance.",

I think Ferris acts better as a way to tie the movie together and give a specific, carefree vibe to the movie than actually be an interesting character. And all of that seems to have more to do with how the movie was written, not how Broderick portrayed it. I think he was perfectly charismatic and fun for what he was made to do.",

That\u2019s why his theme is getting Cameron to \u201clive his life\u201d.\n\nHowever the character arc that takes place over the story belongs to Cameron. His transformation from death (literally pretending to die at the beginning of the movie) to life by way of pushing back against his father by killing what he wrongly loved most (his car), which happens through Ferris. \n\nI realize this has nothing to do with the post, lmao",

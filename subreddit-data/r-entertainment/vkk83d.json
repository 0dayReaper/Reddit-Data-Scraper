I've been looking forward to this since I bought tickets almost 2.5 years ago.\n\nRun the Jewels is most definitely a spiritual successor to rage on the hip hop side of things. As groovy as rage can be, RTJ beats hit so persistently hard. It's fresher music but honestly I think they're going to be hard to follow for rage and I say that as someone who skipped a chance to see Rage in 2008 and have made seeing them a bucket list item ever since. Check out RTJ when you get a chance if you're not familiar.",

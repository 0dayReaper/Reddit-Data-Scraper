According to the visiting neighbor, as told to the Daily Beast, Miller was wearing a bulletproof vest and began acting erratically. The actor allegedly claimed that the board game Parcheesi has Rastafarian roots and, when questioned on the specifics of this claim, opened their jacket to reveal a gun and said, \"Talking like that could get you into a really serious situation.\"\u201d\n\nhttps://ew.com/celebrity/ezra-miller-allegedly-harassed-minor-gun/",

The restraining order claimed Miller burst into the couple\u2019s bedroom and threatened them, and Miller allegedly stole some of the couple\u2019s belongings, including a passport and wallet.",

The director and producers of The Flash have stood by Miller throughout the ordeal.\n\n\n&gt; Though Miller has kept a very low profile since making that announcement, Variety reports that **the actor will be in attendance at the Los Angeles premiere of The Flash on June 12. But while they'll be on the red carpet to pose for photos, Miller won't be participating in any interviews with press at the event.** \n\n&gt; **Michael Keaton, who co-stars in the film alongside Miller, won't be attending as he is currently working on a project in London.** Director Andy Muschietti will be present alongside The Flash stars Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon, and Ben Affleck.",

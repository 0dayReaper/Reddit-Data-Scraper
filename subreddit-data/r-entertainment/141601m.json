I\u2019m not one to spam bad reviews of films I don\u2019t enjoy, but I got nothing out of it: Felt bland, flat, and lazy. \n\nI\u2019d throw it in the same camp as other long-in-gestation sequels such as Zoolander 2 or Dumb &amp; Dumber To: They\u2026.exist, barely. But they hold zero presence in the overall zeitgeist beyond their opening weekend.",

Overall, the film landed at No. 5 on the most-streamed movies of 2022 with a total of 5.7 billion minutes viewed.\n\nWhile the first film was not a box office hit, it became a cult hit over the years thanks to airings on basic cable.\n\nThe third film would follow Kenny Ortega\u2019s 1993 original and last year\u2019s Anne Fletcher-directed sequel, both of which starred\u00a0Bette Midler,\u00a0Sarah Jessica Parker\u00a0and\u00a0Kathy Najimy\u00a0as the Sanderson sisters \u2014\u00a0Winifred, Sarah and Mary, respectively \u2014\u00a0a trio of witches who suck the life force out of children in an effort to stay young.\n\nAt the\u00a0Hocus Pocus 2\u00a0premiere last year, executive producer Adam Shankman hinted to\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0that there were more stories to be told. That film introduced teen Becca (Whitney Peak), who turns out to be a witch herself.\n\nFletcher \u201chandled that [storyline] really, really beautifully,\u201d\u00a0Shankman said\u00a0of Becca\u2019s discovery. \u201cWe went back and forth on how that was going to work, if it was going to work, forever, and Anne was just like, \u2018This is what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019 And I think it\u2019s great. And it creates a lot of excitement about potential spinoffs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if there have been any discussions with Midler, Parker and Najimy. For her part, Midler\u00a0told\u00a0Entertainment Weekly\u00a0last year that she\u2019d be game to revisit her role.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to have a franchise \u2014 especially a character I love playing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there was a third one, of course I\u2019d sign on, but I don\u2019t know how. I can\u2019t imagine what the story would be, but I love Winifred, Sarah, Mary and our relationship. It\u2019s good for women. We stick together through hell and high water, but we do cause mayhem, and not many women cause that much mayhem.\u201d",

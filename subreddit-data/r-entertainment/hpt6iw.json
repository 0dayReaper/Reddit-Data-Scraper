Your objection is noted and you can have a discussion about that in court and you might get the answer stricken and thus unusable as evidence, but an objection does not mean you don't have to answer. And even when you do object on grounds of privileged information, well you at the very least have a very solid good faith argument for why it is privileged and not just \"I don't want to answer that\".\n\nIt does not work at all like a subpoena where you get to have objections resolved before answering. There's a whole bunch of reasons for why, but they all generally boil down to time. A deposition can have several hundred questions and if you object to say 100 of them on the same grounds. Well then you can after the fact resolve that objection in one go. If you have to resolve them every time, well now you suddenly have to resolve it 100 times and stop the deposition while it's resolved, turning a 4 hour deposition, into a 6 month long full time process...",

                    "comment": "Yeah, not the case at all. He's been caught lying about the drugs about a million times already, and he's made some statements that are...interesting, at the very least. Among others, he's said it's not possible to get addicted to cocaine because it's not an opiate, and he said that if he ingests MDMA or mushrooms, he somehow doesn't get high, because they don't affect him. You can find the full transcripst of his cross examinations at www.nickwallis.com. Strongly recommend, they're pretty amusing. \n\nThere's one point where they're asking him about a photo of him passed out on the floor, and he's saying he merely fell asleep, as he sometimes does that. The barrister is asking him \"fully clothed? Right next to the bed?\" and he's just saying yup, I do sleep on the floor, but he tries to say that there's something soft underneath his head, like a pillow. His head is literally inside a cabinet. The photo is making rounds in tabloids, have a look for yourselves. There's another part where he's trying to claim that texting his assistant asking for cocaine and 'happy pills' is just him asking for some doctor-prescribed medication to go along with his cocaine. Probably could have asked the medical professional who travelled with him for the purpose of supplying him with his medication. He's never even heard of anyone referring to ecstasy as happy pills! \n\nThere's one part where they're describing an incident on a plane. Heard says Depp was drunk and on drugs, got verbally and physically abusive, passed out in the toilet. Depp says he wasn't intoxicated but had maybe had a couple of drinks, he remembers every minute, he was calmly drawing in his sketchbook when Heard went nuts and he had to escape to sleep in the toilet with a pillow to get away from her rage. \n\nAt first he's saying she's fabricated all these lies about the incident and she has \"quite an imagination!\" and just vehemently denies every point, then the barrister hits him with the evidence. He ends up saying that he made a mistake and forgot that he had been drinking the whole night before, had not eaten for days, took pills, took cocaine before and during the flight, had vodka red bulls, and drank two bottles of champagne on the plane. He also had to be helped off, because he was too loaded to get off the plane by himself. There's texts to Heard from him saying he's sorry and ashamed, and text to his friend saying how he was 'drunk and shitty' to Heard on the plane. There's texts from his assistant to Heard saying he's sobered up a bit, and \"when I told him he kicked you, he cried.\" My favourite part was when they played an audio recording of him on the plane, and he says he doesn't think it was him, then he admits there was no one else on the plane making those noises. He says \"that sounds like an animal!\", the barrister says \"I would suggest that animal was you, because you had too many drinks and did too many drugs. \" Then he had to admit he actually misrepresented the whole situation and he had a blackout and was hammered and high. Oops! \n\nAnother funny instance was when he's said Heard withheld his medication, and it was one of the cruellest things she has done to him. This claim I've actually seen pop up on Reddit frequently. Well, it turns out that when she took him to his house in the Bahamas to detox from drugs under medical supervision, sometimes if he'd get withdrawal symptoms at 3.15pm and he'd ask her for medication, but she said he can only have them at 4pm as per the instructions of the doctor. Heavens forbid, how dare she not give pills to an addict whenever he asks! The barrister asks whether she went against medical advice, he said she did not. \n\nRead the court transcripts, what you've said is complete bullshit. They're greatly entertaining, at least for a procrastinating law student. The barrister for The Sun is doing pretty great, him not so much.\n\nAlso, why would he settle? He brought forth the legal proceedings against The Sun, it makes absolutely zero sense to say he would settle the case because Amber Heard thought he'd settle a case that he initiated against a magazine because of drugs.",

You're making it seem he was asking for illegal drugs. Strange enough the exact same strategy The Sun's lawyer is doing. Curious indeed. \n\nAlso, you've yet to reply to this audio of Heard that was \"released years ago\" because from the numerous timelines publications have made, this doesn't exist. The audios only became public this year.",

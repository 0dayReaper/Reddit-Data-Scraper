            "comment": "&gt;In the coming weeks, the enormous casita will reopen with new owners: Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone, both native Coloradans, who have spent upward of $40 million to tear it down, rebuild it and, they joke, to keep everything the same, except now sanitary.\n\n\n&gt;\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stink like chlorine anymore,\u201d Mr. Stone said in an interview in late May, during the final, frantic stretch to reopen. \u201cWe could have rebuilt this twice as big, for half as much money, but we spent so much restoring it, like a piece of art.\u201d\n\n&gt;Mr. Parker added: \u201cAnd the food is excellent.\u201d\n\n&gt;Indeed, Casa Bonita returns as one of the biggest Mexican restaurants in the world, and the new executive chef, Dana Rodriguez, is a six-time James Beard Award nominee. Local fans of Casa Bonita speak of the reopening as if the beloved \u201cOrange Crush\u201d Denver Broncos of 1977 had been revived from a cryogenic state. More than 100,000 potential customers have signed up on the restaurant\u2019s website to make a reservation, Mr. Stone said.\n\n&gt;The original cost of renovations was projected at $10 million. When the figure reached $20 million, business advisers encouraged Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker to pack it in. These days, Mr. Stone said, the investment was closer to \u201cinfinity dollars.\u201d\n\n&gt;As Mr. Parker put it, \u201cIt would be way cheaper if we just went hang gliding over volcanoes.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cWhat we\u2019ve come to realize over the last couple of months is, now we have a lot of work to do to make it a sustainable business,\u201d Mr. Parker said.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s such a visceral place,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I hope makes it so cool.\u201d\n\n&gt;Mr. Stone said: \u201cThat\u2019s worth infinity dollars.\u201d",

No politics, no real honest plan to make 40 mil back any time soon. Just something to make people happy that cost them a shit ton of money. Males me want to believe there is still hope for us.",

Even before South Park did the episode.\n\n It even shines through through as a central topic of satire of r/denvercirclejerk, and as serious discussion in /r/Denver.\n\nAlso, legend has it, that to become a true Colorado native, you need three things - a visit to Cosa Bonita, a Suburu Outback, and your undying devotion to Blucifer. The anatomically correct horse statue that guards the entrance of Denver International Airport. Only then are you granted your \"Native\" bumper sticker and full Native status.\n\nNamaste \ud83d\ude4f",

Heck, even I was taken away by the amount, butt it\u2019s because nobody outside of Colorado has fully appreciate what those two did.  Every state out there has that one place that \u201cused to be huge but has run into disrepair.\u201d So when a non Colorado citizen reads they spent $40 million on a Mexican food place, it boggles their mind. But if they could equate it to something more local to them then they would get it.and then it\u2019s compounded by the fact that Parker &amp; Stone aren\u2019t the local guys you would think as stepping up save anything really.  Be as if Tom Green came back out of obscurity and said he\u2019d personally finance the rebuilding of any part of Canada that\u2019s currently on fire. Or Howard Stern doing the same for any smaller business wiped out around the World Trade Center.  Anybody who takes five minutes to see what that place used to be and will be again would be thrilled about it.",

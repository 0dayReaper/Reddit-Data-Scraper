She originally had cancer in the late 00\u2019s, went into remission, got told in September 2014 that it was back, she was gone as of December 6, 2015.\n\nIncredibly rough to go through, my mom ended up stopping treatments shortly around the area where Shannon Doherty is at.",

In my grandfather's case, we knew he was terminal simply due to his age and poor condition of his lungs, but for my grandmother she had been improving. We were talking to the doctors around noon one day about her getting discharged in the morning and coming home. She suddenly took a turn in the evening and passed very early in the morning.",

He came out on the last day and gave us all hugs and said goodbye to all of us.  Talked with us all for 20 minutes and then gone again.  We were all crying because he was lucid.  Dead within 5 hours.  \n\nGuy was a brilliant physicist and went down a long path.  He used to work on a high voltage metal separator and doc told us it was so unsafe, given EMFs.   \n\nWe, as kids, were sent over to babysit and pretend we didn\u2019t see him sneak out to see him pee/poo and raid the refrigerator. \n\nIt was because of him I majored in physics.  Just broke my heart to see him go that way.  \n\nHis son went to MIT.  I went to WPI and then UCONN for grad studies all because of him.  Most awesome as he went to WPI and I wanted to follow him.  \n\nWe would play Chess without a board as you had to remember every piece and location in your head and he always won.  He trained me for that.  He and I used to do it every Sunday at my grandmother\u2019s.  Dad thought both he and I were freaks. \n\nSmartest person I ever met.  His son is testimony as he was 8 mo old when he died and still achieved MIT.  My heart is broken now as I haven\u2019t thought of Joe in decades.",

My wife for example was HER2 protein and estrogen positive. That means the cancer feeds off them to grow, which means it can spread rapidly, but also be treated well by blocking HER2 and estrogen, in combination with radiation, chemo and full mastectomy. On that treatment path, HER2+ and estrogen+ breast cancer, which has one of the higher reoccurrence rates at around 30% goes down to 6% within 5 years (reoccurrence usually comes within 5 years, so reoccurrence and survival rates are usually counted in 5 and 10 years).  It\u2019s critical though that she sticks to HER2 blockers for 6 months after being cleared, and hormone blockers for 10 years, which many women don\u2019t because of the side effects or because they want to have children. Every time I hear about breast cancer reoccurrence I have to comfort myself with statistics. Even in those with metastatic breast cancer, there are many (although a small minority) who live beyond 10 years. It\u2019s absolutely survivable and research is making it better all the time. To anyone else who freaks out about this news, it\u2019s not blind hope, it\u2019s science.",

It's called \"metastasis.\" After a certain point in its growth, the tumor begins shedding cells that get swept up into the body's circulatory systems. Think of it like the life cycle of a dandelion, and metastasis is the seed head stage. The tumor sheds \"seed\" cells into the circulatory systems, where they seek out and find whatever healthy fast-growth cells it is they feed on, and those shoots set up new tumors.\n\nBasically once a cancer goes metastatic the diagnosis is terminal, because once it's in the circulatory systems it becomes impossible to eradicate the body of cancer cells completely with the rather crude and barbaric treatment options scientific research has thusfar afforded us. (\"Kill every possible fast-growing cell and hope the patient lives long enough to recover\" is how chemo was explained to me.) I'm not being ungrateful, chemo bought my family an extra year or so with my Ma, just being honest about the realities of its mechanism. Hopefully in my lifetime, the world will see more advances in treatment options - maybe the gene therapies that have been showing promise in certain cases - and fewer people will have to suffer, from neither the disease nor the treatment. \n\nI hope this helps!",

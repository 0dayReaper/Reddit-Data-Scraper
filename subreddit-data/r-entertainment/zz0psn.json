I was on a cruise like fifteen years ago and was reading this book about this guy who escaped scientilogy but his wife and 2 children didnt. There\u2019s a part in it where he explains that there\u2019s this cruise for Scientologists. Lo and behold my ship was docked right next to theirs one morning. It was surreal. Everything looked odd on it from afar. I cant imagine the shady stuff happening on board.\n\nEdit : In 2011, former Sea Org member Valeska Paris reported that she had been imprisoned onboard Freewinds to prevent her from leaving Scientology, after joining at age 14.[20][21] Once she was taken to the ship, expecting to be onboard two weeks, Paris said her passport was taken from her, after which she was held against her will, forced into manual labor for 12 years,[22] and unable to leave the ship without an escort for six years.[23][24]\n\nHer story was corroborated by a former Sea Org member who said \"[Valeska] made it very clear she did not want to be there. She had been sent to the ship so as not to be in contact with one of her parents and that's not what she wanted, she was very, very distressed.\"[20] The Church of Scientology has denied the claims.\n\nThis is fucking insane.",

The ship they're talking about is probably the Freewinds, which they use for courses for \"advanced\" level Scientologists. \n\nSea Org is a bit like if you combine the Boy Scouts, the Catholic Inquisition, the Salvation Army and the secret police of a banana republic, make it Navy themed, and infuse it with bureaucratic, vaguely spacey-techy gobbledygook. They're basically the free labor, administrative and police force of Scientology.\n\nThe Sea Org got its start as the crew of the ships L. Ron Hubbard was using to hide from the law some time in the 60s, but the average Sea Org member now probably couldn't sail a ship to save their life.",

No, it's not the name of the contract, but if you're in the Sea Org, you signed a billion year contract, and while in the Sea Org, you may never go on the Freewinds. You may go on the ship for services as a regular old Scientologist that has not signed the contract and joined Sea Org. Freewinds is essentially a higher level mobile Org that functions like other Orgs while letting you scuba dive and ride horses in tropical places in between services.\n\nThe Sea Org operates everywhere Scientology is, to some degree, though the majority will be in Clearwater, FL or Los Angeles, followed by Saint Hill and a few other locations. Clearwater is by far the biggest hub. They also operate on the ship, though it's a small ship (especially as far as cruise ships go these days). \n\nHubbard had a nautical fetish, that's for sure.",

Bla bla you get the idea. \n\nA lot of hurdles for law enforcement to overcome with this.\nThe two main Scientology locations in America are quite extensive. It'd be easy to get lost in those buildings. It'd take hundreds of people to execute a search warrant properly IMO. Hell look at how many buildings they own in Clearwater. They could keep anyone hidden in Clearwater alone. \n\nHave a search warrant for one building? Then they could move him to the next and start the process over again.\n\n At his level he could stay hidden in those two areas (LA &amp; Clearwater) for who knows how long. I suspect that he can go unseen (by law enforcement) within their premises as long as he wants. He has dozens of people around him at any given moment. What's another person to him if their sole job is to prevent unwanted eyes from seeing his movements. \n\nHe could also be on their big boat the Freewinds in the Caribbean which means he could go to a country with no extradition to the US. Maybe hide out in the UK at Saint Hill or at a dozen other facilities around the world and live in comfort.\n\nThe entire cult should have collapsed years ago. Even with all the money they've hoarded and I know little about that too. When I left the IAS (International Association of Scientologists) had about $650mil. That's just one account. They have around a dozen that I recall. Billions in assets.\n\n \nThe \"Chairman of the Board\" as they call him could disappear for the rest of his life and no non Scientologist would ever know.\n\n**Edit**: Someone commented then deleted about plants in Law Enforcement to tip off the Scientologist. \n\n It's certainly possible. It's been many years since I was active but I don't imagine they've changed their modus operandi much. The old timers that did those \"Operations\" you read about aren't that involved anymore if they're alive that is. They'd be old by now. Their positions taken over by literal teens in some cases.\n\nAny LEO personnel that are active in Scientology would not be in any position of real power or authority though. There are policies regarding such people and the limits of their potential progress in Scientology as a \"Staff/ Sea Org\" member or as a \"Public\" member. Whereabouts of the highest ranked person in Scientology would be highly concealed info that they would probably not know till after the fact. They'd be pawns. \n\nThe strategic counter to *any* plants in whatever law enforcement would be to employ verified former Scientologists familiar with facilities and ideally with the Chairman himself. The more recent the better.

That was a rough time. You Flag guys also had to deal with \"Mecca\" and SuperPower stuff too at that time IIRC.\n\nI don't think I kept anything besides a couple of fiction books like Kingslayer.\n\nLol occasionally after threads like this I get DMs from who I assume are Scientologists try to bait me by throwing names (all wrong so far lads).\n\nEven so. If I get declared DIR I&amp;R can suck my turds haha. None of my closest friends care. None of my family care as they're all out or never had anything to do with it in the first place. \n\nIt'd be rough for only one person I know really and I'm not convinced they would care at this point either. The rest of the people? They can either pretend to not know and behave or leave me alone like they've done.\n\nThe trick with moving is to contact CENT-ADDO specifically beforehand and asked to be changed to \"DO NOT MAIL\". That updates all their mailing and contact listings, stops the default procedure of getting the forwarding address from the post office. So that way they don't know where you move to. And saves a few trees. Usually stops calls too. \n\nAs for in person harassment? Lol I hate that this comes off as iamverbadass but I am a scary person when I want to be. Having seen first hand what kind of people they sent to harass others I am way more threatening than the sexually repressed memeless teens they might send. Also I carry and am absolutely more trained in hand to hand. If they actually try violent shit then that's on them. None of the local people would dare try that shit.",

If that was the sole bond between you then it might be better for you in the long run to cut your losses and hope they leave on their own. Maybe meet after that. Some \"friends\" might see you as just a stat or recovery or reg prospect. \n\nI asked myself about every person I thought I cared about: Are they really my friend? Do we hang out outside of the Org? If I asked for help what form would that take? A course recommendation or would they actually care enough to help me emotionally and financially?\n\nThey say they're a friend? They can prove it. No Scientology stuff period when you are around them. If they can't do that then they're probably working some angle. Cynicism is an Ex-Scientologists best friend.",

Ron Hubbard\u2019s solution to this problem, when he encountered it in the late 60s, was to establish an ersatz Navy (which he called the Sea Org) and float around between the Caribbean and the coast of Africa.\n\nAfter that they eventually made landfall in Clearwater Florida and established a base of operations under false pretenses (claiming to be a vaguely Christian sounding religious group).\n\nUltimately Hubbard died in a motor home out in the California desert, where he had lived alone and mostly out of touch for the several years preceding his death.\n\nThings are getting interest for Miscavige.  There will be a hearing January 20th at which a judge will decide what to do about his obvious attempts at evasion; Plaintiff\u2019s counsel has asked that he be considered served, since they\u2019ve been trying so hard.  Miscavige has hired the former head of the Florida Bar to represent in him a limited capacity and try to argue the court has no jurisdiction to serve him.  This feels like a Hail Mary to me, since the court could (I imagine) now simply serve that attorney if they don\u2019t buy the jurisdictional argument.\n\nI wonder if the judge might be able to issue some kind of bench warrant or contempt of court action.  We can dream.\n\nIn any event, Miscavige is capable of hiding out at any one of a number of locations, to include Clearwater, Los Angeles, or aboard the Freewinds.\n\nThe Church of Scientology is allegedly into all sorts of terrible stuff, to include but not limited to:\n\n- The death (via neglect) of Lisa McPherson\n\n- The semi-covert operation of a fee-structured counseling business under the guise of a religion for tax evasion purposes, that charges people hundreds of thousands of dollars\n\n- Predatory financial practices to include encouraging parishioners to take out mortgages on their homes and max out credit cards to buy services and future services for themselves and loved ones\n\n- \u2018Disconnection\u2019, a policy whereby Scientologists are not permitted to talk to family who have left the church on bad terms \n\n- Religious practices that discourage disclosing sexual abuse to the police (as in the Danny Masterson case)\n\n- The imprisonment of numerous people at Gold Base near Hemet California and aboard the freewinds\n\n- Human rights abuses in which people have been placed on the \u2018rehabilitation project force\u2019 and in \u2018the hole\u2019 and forced to eat scraps, work long hours with little or no sleep, engage in manual labor with minimal training (including electrical work)\n\n- The likely captivity of Shelly Miscavige\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nFor more information, see xenu.net, Mike Rinder\u2019s blog, and aftermath.org.\n\nOr read\n\n\u2018Going Clear\u2019 by Lawrence Wright\n\n\u2018A Billion Years\u2019 by Mike Rinder\n\n\u2018Ruthless\u2019 by Ron Miscavige\n\n\u2018Bare Faced Messiah\u2019, an outstanding biography of L Ron Hubbard\n\nOr watch the documentary film \u2018Going Clear\u2019, the series \u2018Scientology and the Aftermath\u2019 by Leah Remini, or \u2018My Scientology Movie\u2019 by Louis Thoreaux\n\nThen contact your congressperson and ask them to review these materials, and contact the IRS and ask them to review Scientology\u2019s tax exempt status.",

That pristine video quality, coupled with Dolby Vision HDR, makes Dolby theaters definitely way better than IMAX in terms of picture quality, but not *that* much better if you already have a high-end large OLED at home.\n\nHonestly, to me, the sound is the biggest selling point \u2014 Dolby theaters feature Dolby Atmos sound systems, which means the walls and the ceilings are all literally covered with speakers to create the ultimate immersion of surround audio. AMC Dolby theaters also jolt your chair whenever there is a loud, boomy sound like explosions and stuff like that, which feels better than you might think, the effect is done really well. So the sound is the part that really cannot be replicated at home unless you own a mansion.",

Like I get you didn't care about the movie and just brought your kid, but that bright light is so distracting for everyone.\n\nThen I went to a Broadway Across Canada production for my birthday the other weekend and again someone was on their phone the whole time, but too many seats away for me to say anything.

It was very annoying. And I didn't even go opening weekend, I tend to avoid those for Marvel movies cause of how packed it is and higher chance of idiots like that appearing. \n\nIt probably doesn't happen as often as you would think from reddit.

Its still a pretty clear warning, but not as much of a hard line in the sand.\n\nWe want to see a showing of LoTR and the people next to us were incredibly loud. When we put up an order card, the servers never showed up to take it.\n\nI feel like in years past they would proactively have someone check in on the theaters every once in a while to tell people to be quiet, but they don't anymore. Probably just due to becoming more corporate and cutting staffing hours for profit.\n\nStill my favorite theater, but not as good as it used to be.",

Intermissions are a thing is *some* cinemas, which is the problem as it means it's not a thing in some (most) other cinemas so intermissions are more or less shoehorned in.\n\nFor example, Lawrence of Arabia has an intermission (even on the DVD) and I don't feel like it detracted from the film at all. Because it was originally edited with an intermission in mind (and at 227 minutes long it needs one).\n\nThat's not to say all movies should have them (all movies shouldn't be long enough to need one in the first place). There's definitely movies where it would screw things up... Like Memento or something would be totally ruined by an intermission, but it's only an hour and 53 minutes and would probably be ruined by adding another hour to the runtime to warrant an intermission anyway. So yeah, movies shouldn't be long unless they warrant it, but I feel like that's true regardless. Movies shouldn't be short unless they warrant it either. for example the theatrical cut for Kingdom of Heaven had so much cut out for a shorter runtime that the movie suffers significantly, one of the re-cuts (there's several) is far far better because it has those extra scenes that should have been there. They should really be as long as the film warrants.",

The gimmick they\u2019re most known for is that you can order a real dinner that they deliver to you during the movie. \n\nBut what I love is that they have a \u201cdon\u2019t text or talk or you\u2019ll be tossed out of the theater\u201d policy.\n\nThey also have some [wicked PSAs that emphasize that policy!](https://youtu.be/1L3eeC2lJZs)\n\nEDIT: I'm getting a lot of the same comments from people who've never been to an Alamo, so I'll clear up a few things: \n\n* You only speak with your server *before* the movie starts. Once the movie is going, any requests you have are written on slips of paper, so no one is shouting over the soundtrack. \n\n* They're not serving food on fine china with metal cutlery. There's zero excess noise from people eating.\n\n* The servers don't distract from the movie. They're not stepping on your toes to deliver stuff. You have a small table in front of you and a wide aisle in front of that. When they're delivering or taking away stuff, they're not really in your sight-line. They're crouching a few feet in front of you, and the angle of the theater plus the fact that you're looking up at the screen means they're mostly invisible. The presence of the servers isn't distracting.",

They deserve their success.\n\nI talked about the food before but the thing I most appreciate is that before every movie they don't just show random promos. They show stuff that explicitly ties in with the movie you're about to see. \n\nI saw the new Avatar movie there, and they first showed an interview with James Cameron. Then they showed the SNL [Ryan Gosling \"Papyrus\" skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhlJNJopOQ).\n\nThen they showed a hilarious racap of the first movie. The narrator sounded offended when he mentioned that some people claimed it ripped off Fern Gully, then in the following recap it summarized the entire Avatar movie with Fern Gully clips! I was dying.\n\nInstead of getting mad at all the commercials, I always look forward to getting to Alamo early to see the stuff they've dug up to show.",

Back in the 1980s, intermission was a short 15min break at the center of the movie. Lights came on and elevator music played.\n\nSome positives,\n\n* The majority of movie theatres make their money off of snacks. An intermission could drive up these sales.\n\n* It gives you the chance to go to the bathroom.\n\n* We all have phones. Those that don't want to snack or bathroom, can keep entertained as they check their messages.etc.\n\nWhy don't they bring intermission back?",

I think that it's a better experience if *everyone* understands what's going on, so if she's too lost, I'm perfectly fine with pausing the movie to explain (as that's what the pause button exists for).\n\nDo we get off track and distracted sometimes after pausing the movie? Sure. However I also contend that the ensuing 2 hour long conversation that we occasionally have is quite worth it to my relationship, and are quite memorable.\n\nIf it happens in the theatre, she is at least good enough to keep her voice low so as not to disturb other patrons. We also have common courtesy so the ensuing conversation we normally may have is held til the film is over.\n\nIt may be just \"thinking out loud\" for some, but for her it's because the neurodivergence genuinely interferes with the telling of the story of the film if it goes too fast for her. \n\nMore people (read: cinephiles) should chill about the pause button when at home\u2014 it doesn't \"ruin\" the movie and other movie watchers who don't consume film as they do may need it on occasion.",

But these guys clearly haven't been to a screening that was open to the public in a long time. If it was just me alone in the theater or with a select few people who I knew wanted to see the movie, it would be different, but most of the time there are people talking and people on their phones. And it's usually not worth trying to shut them up because, especially if you live in a big city, there's always a chance that they'll get aggressive or pissy about it. On top of that, it's ridiculously expensive. Tickets for a family of four BEFORE SNACKS cost upwards of $100, and you don't even get a premium experience for that price. The floors are often sticky, there's usually discarded trash around because people don't want to clean up after themselves - it's gross! I once saw someone bring an entire rotisserie chicken into a movie and then leave the carcass behind. A \"deal between yourself and a piece of art\" indeed. I challenge James Cameron to actually go to a Friday night 9pm showing of Avatar 2 in a crowded multiplex. Then we'll see how much he gushes about the magic of going to the movie theater. I don't avoid them because I dislike the experience of going to the movies there, I avoid them because other movie goers can be absolute shit heads sometimes.",

As long as people aren't yelling or being disrespectful, I enjoy hearing how people react",

They also don't release movies online at the same time, so you can't watch at home to try to force you to go to the theatre cause it makes them more money. Everything is more expensive.\n\nThe audience is hit or miss, I've had people that spend the entire movie kicking the back of my chair and they get sassy with me when I ask them to stop. Hearing the entire audience's reactions to the movie is awesome though, that's about the only thing you don't get watching at home.",

            "comment": "Captain America 4\u00a0has a new moniker.\n\nMarvel Studios\u00a0announced Tuesday morning via its Twitter account that the fourth\u00a0Captain America\u00a0installment \u2014 and the first to feature star\u00a0Anthony Mackie\u00a0as the lead \u2014 is now called\u00a0Brave New World.\n\nThe news came alongside a behind-the-scenes photo of stars Mackie and\u00a0Harrison Ford. Last July, the studio announced the film was originally subtitled\u00a0New World Order. The release date has been set for May 3, 2024.\n\nBrave New World\u00a0comes on the heels of the events of\u00a0Avengers: Endgame\u00a0and the Disney+ series\u00a0The\u00a0Falcon and the Winter Soldier. The former saw Chris Evans\u2019 Steve Rogers pass the Captain America shield on to Mackie\u2019s Sam Wilson, who had been serving as hero Falcon since\u00a0Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\u00a0which released in 2014.\n\nThe Disney+ series saw Wilson contemplating whether he was willing to take over the role passed to him while working alongside Bucky Barnes (Winter Soldier, portrayed by Sebastian Stan) as the U.S. government created their own \u201cCaptain America\u201d in Wyatt Russell\u2019s U.S. Agent. (Both of those actors are set to appear as their characters in the upcoming\u00a0Thunderbolts,\u00a0production on which has been delayed\u00a0due to the ongoing writers strike, alongside other existing and new characters from\u00a0Black Widow,\u00a0Ant-Man and the Wasp\u00a0and beyond.)\n\nCo-written by\u00a0Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u2018s Malcolm Spellman with Julius Onah, who is also set to direct,\u00a0Brave New World\u00a0will see Mackie continue on with Wilson\u2019s journey as Captain America, while Ford makes his MCU debut as Thaddeus \u201cThunderbolt\u201d Ross, in a role that he has taken over following the death of William Hurt.\n\nThe film will see the return of two\u00a0Incredible Hulk\u00a0characters, Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake) and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), with Ford\u2019s Thunderbolt serving as the U.S. president. Shira Haas and Danny Ramirez also star, with Carl Lumbly returning as his\u00a0Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u00a0character Isaiah Bradley.",

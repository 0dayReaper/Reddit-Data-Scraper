The value of a currency is only based on the value people see in trading it - if people no longer see value in that currency, then its trading value goes down, and since it only exists for trading, its actual value, including use-value, goes down as well. (Whereas the use-value for other types of good may not go down at the same rate as its trade value.) You're not saying crypto is a scam, you're saying currency is a scam - which, granted, is true, it's a worthless good whose only purpose is to hold the illusion of tradeable value, but I'm not sure how you run an economy without it.\n\nAs to NFT jpegs... well, in goods that aren't currency, this is called \"bigger fool theory.\" The value only exists so long as there is a bigger fool willing to pay more than you did. But so long as there *is* a bigger fool, the value *does* exist. And in the market for NFT images of monkeys, there are a whole lot of fools.",

Or rather, not even \"the\" link, but \"a\" link, since until actual litigation happens that sets precedent to say otherwise, it's likely legal to sell a different NFT of the same image, since again, you're buying the link, not the image rights usually. The reason it's not happened yet is that the grifters stay out of each others way.",

Instead of being a currency, crypto has turned into a baseless speculative financial investment, and the actually use case of them competing with USD as far as utility currency have been long forgotten. I remember a few years ago one of my cryptonut friends was telling me I'd be shopping at the grocery store with crypto within a year or two. I asked him how a grocery store would be expected to accept a \"currency\" that fluctuates up and down constantly, his answer was just some crypto word salad about the blockchain or whatever.\n\nCrypto will never go mainstream and replace paper currency unless people stop pump &amp; dumping it and it's value can hold still and increase sustainably over time. And even then I doubt it. 90% of crypto related anything is a complete fucking scam and it's all a scourge on the environment.",

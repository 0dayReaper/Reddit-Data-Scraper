                                    "comment": "The point is there is in-universe reasoning/logic for the visual depiction of the characters. What was LOTR inspired by? Why did the author, whose creation should be respected, chose to describe the races how he did? What about a series like say The Witcher, written by a Polish author, inspired heavily if not entirely by Slavic settings, lore, mythology, culture and people... it's not \"white\" because the author is racist or it's just lacking in color. It is \"white\" (white passing, slavic) because that is what the people in Poland look like. When you make a show set in Wakanda, a fictional fantastical country set on a planet that has aliens and such on it, it is completely logical that all Wakandans are black for the reasons I gave. When a show is set in a fictional fantastical world but is heavily inspired by say a European country, in which the people there are nearly entirely \"white\", and it takes place in the \"past\" (not some future sci-fi or cyberpunk era), the characters being \"white\" isn't some indication of a lack of diversity. \n\nThe same basically applies to Game of Thrones as well, with GRRM extremely inspired by European events (like the English War of Roses), settings, characters and so on. Now that doesn't stop him from having foreign lands like Dorne, inspired by countries like Spain and Portugal. There are POC who enter the story. But the show is centered on British, Irish, Scottish and the like historical settings, characters and events. When you go and make a decision like in HotD to bring have the Velaryons be black. That breaks the in-universe logic of the entire race of people in the books. They are identical to the Targaryens so they can breed with each other and maintain the purity of their Valyrian blood. Why it wasn't a problem was their children came out looking identical to Targaryens. \n\nNot to mention many of these shows have well written racism, colorism, xenophobia and so on, in them. So when people are hateful to another \"race\" because of their ears or eyes or whatever little difference there is, it breaks the story lore when now main characters are walking around black/asian/etc and it's never mentioned. Now all of a sudden these hateful, racist jerks are overlooking skin color completely but hating each other because of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. It makes no sense. \n\nSo, no, my argument doesn't fall apart. There are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many cases in which racebending is done to check boxes and get pats on the back when it is erasure of European cultured characters like just because they are white they are blank slates to be painted on, devoid of culture and color. There are also way too many examples of it being done at the harm of the in-universe logic. Just like I wouldn't want Wakanda to have some white people and Asian people and such in the country, as Wakandans, I also don't want other shows and movies to have lore breaking racebent characters in them. \n\nIt's fine to have say The Witcher be true to the source material and heavily steeped in Slavic culture and then make something new, like their 'Blood Origin' series and introduce a big diverse cast and such. As long as it doesn't break the in-universe lore.",

Speaking of projecting.\n\nThis post is in large part speaking about the Elf in the picture. Elves by Tolkien were inspired by Germanic and Celtic sources. They are also described as:\n\n&gt;The Elves were the **fairest creatures in Arda**, a far more beautiful race than Men, and generally tall (seldom less than six feet for elf women, no less than six and a half feet for elfmen).\n\nAssume nothing outside deviation normal for Northern (or Northwestern) Europe in regards to their skin color. I believe that while imagining all these stories, he imagined heroes looking like Migration Period (or Early Medieval) Europeans. This is clearly evident in the armour and level of development. And, of course, in his literary interests and influences, which were Anglo-Saxon, Norse and earlier Germanic, from Migration Period, and later. \n\nLike I said already, I'm not huge on Tolkien/LOTR and in ROP I didn't have a specific issue with the casting per-se. A black elf? I mean I'd rather them be a different race of elves (dark elves, wood elves, etc) to explain the massive change in skin color from Tolkien's literary and historical influences to all of a sudden dark skinned Elves walking around. But because I'm not a big fan I'm neither here nor there about it really.",

One part in particular that stands out to me is when he corrects one of the senators questioning him about why he attacked \u201cthe senator\u2019s wife\u201d and he is very clear to say he defended himself against accusations from a member of the PMRC whose name is Tipper Gore.  The senator can\u2019t understand that distinction (hilariously/sadly) because of the inherent sexism in the way they think.  Instead of seeing Tipper as an equal that Dee is addressing, he sees Dee\u2019s comments as an attack on the senator\u2019s wife as though she is someone\u2019s property.\n\nThis is the essence I feel of a lot of right wing social politics.

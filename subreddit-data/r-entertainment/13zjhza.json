In the last 13 years we\u2019ve gotten\n\nToy Story 3\n\nCars 2\n\nBrave\n\nMonsters University\n\nInside Out\n\nThe Good Dinosaur\n\nFinding Dory\n\nCars 3\n\nCoco\n\nThe Incredibles 2\n\nToy Story 4\n\nOnward\n\nSoul\n\nLuca\n\nTurning Red\n\nLightyear\n\nAnd of those movies, The Incredibles 2 is the latest big hit they had, with Toy Story 4 being pretty divisive.\n\nOnward, Soul, Luca, Turning Red and even Elemental coming out this month are all so similar to each other that it\u2019s the same basic plot but the catalyst is changed between them. They\u2019re Pixar movies through and through, but they don\u2019t do anything new, they don\u2019t do anything inventive, and they don\u2019t bring anything new to the table.\n\nPixar was known for being a studio that thought outside of the box, and they\u2019re now known for being a studio that is going to produce the same exact movie multiple times. They need fresh blood.",

                    "comment": "The story about how she singlehandedly saved Toy Story 2 is undercut by the fact that they re-rendered the movie instead of using what she saved.\n\nAt the least the \"singlehandedly\" part seems hard to justify given how many people worked on saving it. They together did a lot more work than she did by (fortunately) having an offline copy of the movie on a hard disk when she was on leave.\n\nAgreed that Elemental seems incredibly derivative (if nothing else it's a lot like Soul, Luck or Inside Out in concept). And Pixar has some kind of song and dance about how Turning Red is some short of \"second tier movie\" to deflect from it being rather unspectacular.\n\nA lot of people really did like Soul though, despite it being another \"personify concepts and set them in a world\" movie.\n\nThey've always been a bit hit or miss anyway. A Bugs Life was no gem, Monsters Inc. is needlessly confused (why have a personified villain when the potential blackout is the real antagonist?), etc.",

                    "comment": "While I agree with your opinion on the health of their studio, I gotta comment regarding your opinion on Onward, Soul, Luca, and Turning Red, because the films are so unique:\n\nOnward does touch on self-actualization like so many \"find yourself\" movies do, but it's not through the lense of typical teenage growing pains, instead it's through some one struggling to move forward (hence the name) because they're holding onto grief. \n\nSoul deals with death! The Pixar golden age attendees are older now, and this is a topic that matured with them. I felt less \"find yourself\" and more \"seize the moment, and hey, if you didn't, don't be too hard on yourself about it\"\n\nLuca's probably the most \"find yourself\" one in the pack, but the clear LGBTQ allegory is just so relevant.\n\nAnd Turning Red! Familial and cultural expectations, the film says \"yes, find yourself, we're Pixar, we've told you that before, but figure out how to create boundaries that allow you to balance your own desires with those cultural expectations or else you'll implode!\". \n\nHow you bunch them together, I don't understand. From my eyes, those 4 films could mean so much to specific groups of people at very different stages of their lives. I love getting a mega hit that everyone can go see, but nothing matches watching something deeply relatable, and I think these films illustrate that. As someone who had an unconventional family structure and big sister, Onward hit me like a ton of bricks. Incredibles 2, not so much.",

Most of the conflict comes from the characters aspiring to be something they aren\u2019t, often due to the expectations (or potential disappointment) of a loved one. There are no real antagonists, just challenging realities to accept.\n\nI think it\u2019s an important and timely message, but it is a bit stale at this point.",

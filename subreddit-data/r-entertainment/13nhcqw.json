He's well known for being extremely fit and active.\n\nI seriously doubt this man could degrade to such an extent that handlers would be in charge yet it wouldn't be very obvious.\n\nFor context: Bruce Willis having some form of health issue had been rumored for years before his family revealed his aphasia diagnosis.\n\nFord's reputation is for being legendarily stubborn. He forced Paramount to relocate shooting for his Yosemite spin-off to the area near his personal ranch for him to even consider taking the role.",

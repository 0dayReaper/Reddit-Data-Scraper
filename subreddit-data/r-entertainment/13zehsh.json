            "comment": "It all started earlier this week when Rammstein (specifically frontman Till Lindemann) was accused of misconduct after a show in Lithuania, which they denied ever happened.\n\nADVERTISEMENT. SCROLL TO CONTINUE READING.\n\nThen yesterday, Lindemann was dropped by his book publisher Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch over those allegations plus usage of his 2013 book In stillen N\u00e4chten in a porn video that allegedly \"celebrates sexual violence against women.\" The dropping of Lindemann also came alongside a separate report published by German news channel Tagesschau detailing more accusations by more women.\n\nRammstein has now issued a statement saying they're taking the accusations very seriously, and that they want fans to feel safe both at the show and backstage. Rammstein further states they \"condemn any kind of transgression\" and that they encourage fans not to be hostile toward those women who have come forward with allegations.\n\nThe following was translated using Google Translate: \"The publications of the last few days have caused irritation and questions among the public and especially among our fans. The allegations hit us all very hard and we take them extremely seriously. We say to our fans: It is important to us that you feel comfortable and safe at our shows \u2013 in front of and behind the stage.\n\n\"We condemn any kind of transgression and ask you: do not engage in public prejudice of any kind against those who have made allegations. You have a right to your point of view. But we, the band, also have a right \u2013 namely not to be prejudiced either.\"",

Don't get me wrong, Vince Neil has an extremely ''throw me out a window'' character, and Tommy is the Genghis Khan of Clamidia, as I'm reasonably certain all infections in the US and parts of Europe can be traced back to him.

It was only a matter of time then that after the camera fell on a few women, one would flash the audience until eventually, every woman featured was compelled to show their breasts to everyone.",

She said she wasn't interested. They said she was still invited backstage that she wanted to participate or not. She didn't go as she was to meet up with friends after the show.\n\nThey seem quite clear about the backstage antics. \nShe even have a picture with Till being disappointed.\n\nIt's not a crime to being a bit perverted, it's a crime if you force people into it. They ask politely and stay polite when turned down.\n\nI found the statement very balanced.",

Rammstein after parties were pretty famous for crazy sex but from all accounts over the years, the sex was consensual and people who didn't partake weren't guilted or shamed and still could enjoy the party.\n\nHowever, Till's personal side project has been getting a bit creepier and not always in the good way, plus there was the Joe Letz controversy a few years ago which also resulted in him being fired by Richard who served as an assistant on the road too.\n\nEvery accusation deserves an investigation though and I hope some actual answers come out.\n\nWhen it comes to the book, I can't really blame them for dropping him.  People get dropped over less and product placement can be kinda dangerous legally and professionally.",

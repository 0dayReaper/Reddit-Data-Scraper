Little mermaid, albeit a solid good movie, is overshadowed by the woke movement and people are speaking up about it.  Disney can try to force feed us their work agenda all they want but we have the right to watch something else.  There was no need to make Ariel black.  After all, there was plenty of blackness already in the movie.  They could have kept to the script but they did not.  This was their choice.  And the resulting box office flop is due to ours.",

However, I think being upset about the \"race\" of the mermaid is a very strange hill to die on. I don't remember \"race\" playing a role in Disney's animated version and I doubt it's significant in the live action version.

In the singing department, she was amazing. Watching interviews of her, she was adorable and seems like a very friendly person. \n\nHowever, her acting was just very flat in the movie. Although, it's not just her though. Everyone else (except Melissa) were also extremely flat. \n\nAnyways, I feel like I need to address some comments you made because I'm sick of people online criticising and practically implying people are racist because it doesn't suit their agenda. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The Little Mermaid backlash would make more sense if Disney's animated version had some type of Danish cultural significance or if her skin color was important to the movie but that was not the case.\n\nWho cares if the skin colour plays a major role or not. If an iconic character is shown a certain way, I want to see it portrayed similarly.\n\nBlack Panther is black, I never want to see him being whitewashed.\n\nMulan is Chinese, I don't want them to turn her black or caucasion.\n\nAriel is white. I don't want to see her portrayed as any other colour but the colour they debuted her with.\n\nUsing excuses like \"oh, their skin colour doesn't play a major role in the story\" doesn't make sense. It breaks the audience's familiarity with said character especially when the film was practically advertised as a fateful remake of the origin with an iconic character. \n\nAnd to use that excuse, does that mean we can start white washing iconic black characters in film because their race doesn't play a major role?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I wonder if people would give the same energy if they made her skin blue in the new movie.\n\nUh... Yeah, they would.\n\nLook, it's easy to chalk it up to people being racist, but maybe... Just maybe... People wanted the remake to be as close to the original as possible.",

Those characters\u2019 races and ethnicities play a significant role in their stories.\n\nDoes it? The name of the culture and everything plays a role, but the skin colour sure don't. The only reason the skin colour is black is because that's how the comic book portrayed the Wakandan at first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And in the animated version Ariel is a cartoon character, the new movie being live action with a different voice \u201calready breaks the audience's familiarity with said character\u201d.\n\nThere are expectations when it comes to remake. People expect to see familiarity because of the attachment to the original. This isn't a new movie where people are going in blind. This is a remake and Disney advertised it as such. So it's not unreasonable for viewers to have that pre-established attachment to said character especially when they're that iconic.\n\nViewers know that it will not be the same, and no one expects it to be exactly the same. However, people do expect to see the story beat being similar and the characters look and personality with some modernization to make the movie better for the modern viewers. You can add a few story elements here and there, but changing a look of a main character is never a good idea. Attachment is a real thing when it comes to film adaption of books or remake of movies. Subverting expectations aren't good when it comes to character portrayals. It's only ever good if they pull it off very well, but even then, it's risky.\n\n* Imagine reading Harry Potter and then having the film adaptation portray Harry Potter as a girl or a male jock.\n* Imagine watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and then having a new series of it but changing Buffy from a woman into a man.\n* Imagine watching Pokemon for all your life and then one day they decided to do a remake of Ash's story but then changing decided to change Pikachu into a Clefairy.\n* Imagine reading Miles Morales story from Spider Man Comic and then the live action movie decided to whitewash him.\n\nPeople will get annoyed. It doesn't even have to be race. When a story sets up that character as that race, look, personality, etc, you shouldn't change it. I know it happens from the history of whitewashing which is disgusting, but it really shouldn't. People have understandably gotten annoyed/upset when portrayal of characters aren't the same.\n\n* Iron Man 3. There was a controversy with how the Mandarin was portrayed because it strayed so far from the original incarnation.\n* The Japanese TV series for Lilo and Stitch infamously removed Lilo and replaced her with a Japanese girl. People were understandably annoyed.  Heck, I'm Japanese and I was annoyed by that change.\n* Avatar the Last Airbender had a horrible live action movie where besides characters (Aang, Katara and Sokka) being white washed and Zuko having his ethnicity changed altogether, none of the characters resemble the personality of their cartoon counterpart. Katara was a shell of her cartoon self and people hated the live action portrayal of her.\n* Digimon 2020 series which is a retell of the original digimon anime was met with criticism. One of the reason was due to the change in characterization, etc.\n* Mulan live action changes Mulan's characterization completely and that didn't sit well with many Mulan fans. (not to mention the removal of Shang).\n* Iago from the live action aladdin was disliked by many too. In the cartoon it was an actual character with a witty personality. The live action version was barely a character. Jaffar's portrayal didn't sit well with people either.\n\n&gt;And haven\u2019t you noticed with every live action remake the plot changes in some way so none of them are \u201cfateful\u201d remakes.\n\nOh, that's a stretch to say it changes the plot. The plot and story beat is the same. Little Mermaid 1997 and Little Mermaid 2023 is about a girl longing to go to the human world. She made a deal with a sea witch to become a human for 3 days. They added things here and there to modernize, enhance or add characterization to characters (subjective I know), but the plot is largely the same.\n\nAnd yes, people can and will still get upset by the changes even in story. People were annoyed that the song \"Daughter of Triton\" was removed. People were annoyed that Flounder was practically removed from the movie. People didn't like the new songs that were added. What? Are they racist for getting upset of those songs getting removed?\n\n&gt;I feel a break in familiarity anytime Disney makes a live action movie based on an animated one so don\u2019t know why race is where you draw the line for a movie where race doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nOh, please... Don't do that. Don't throw the racism card. It's a cop-out way to try to end a discussion by deliberately accusing the opposition as racist to make yourself look better or right.\n\nI'm not drawing the line on race. I'm drawing the line of character portrayal straying from their original interpretation. It can be from personality, feats, looks, plot involvement, etc.\n\nI have given numerous examples and I have explained in the depth of my issue with portrayals. Please don't deliberately miss the point just to make a non-existent point that was never an issue.\n\nI was merely pointing out things that you said that I disagreed with:\n\n1. You claimed that changing race for characters don't matter unless their race plays a role in the story. **I said no to that and listed examples**.\n2. You claimed that if Ariel was blue, people wouldn't get annoyed. **I disagree with that too**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Also I don\u2019t understand how you have given Halle a fair chance when you say you don\u2019t want to see Ariel \u201cportrayed as any other color\u201d besides white.\n\nI did give her a fair chance.\n\nYes, I was a bit shocked when I found out about the casting. As an autistic person who likes routine and familiarity and loved the original Little Mermaid, I was surprised when they changed how Ariel looked. To be honest, I even felt a bit betrayed. It's got nothing to do with her being black. They could cast a Japanese woman and I would be annoyed because it strayed from the original interpretation.\n\nHowever, I didn't let that stop me from watching the movie. I've seen trailers of Halley singing Part of Your World and was amazed by her singing and I thought it could work. I walked into the cinema with an open mind. I **didn't** go in thinking, \"I don't care how she well she acts! I'm gonna hate her acting and the movie no matter what!\"\n\nThe truth is her acting was very subpar. It's not just her, though. Everyone in that movie (except Melissa) was terrible, especially the actor who portrayed King Triton. It has nothing to do with her race. She's just not that good of an actor. She's a brilliant singer, though.\n\nSo yeah, I have given her a fair chance. I didn't let my bias stray from my opinion of her acting or portrayal of said character. In fact, I was really hoping that she would make the character her own, like what Will Smith did with the Genie, but she didn't.\n\n* Was I annoyed at the decision to change the look Ariel? **Yeah.**\n* Did I let that make me hate the movie? **No.**\n* Did that make me automatically dislike Halley's acting? **No.**\n* Did Halley's subpar acting make me hate the movie? **No.**\n* Did the collective subpar acting from everyone in the movie and also boring filler bits make me dislike the movie? **Yeah.**",

I don't care about what race the actor/actress is portraying her. I care about the look of the character. Take skin colour out of it. They can change her hair from red to pink or gold, and I would be annoyed.\n\nThat goes for ANY movies. Not just movie with white characters.

In terms of movies, I think Chinese moviegoers don\u2019t mind if Black people are in roles they think they should have. If Black people are in a role they think they shouldn\u2019t have they don\u2019t support it. In an article from THR, an op-ed published in the Chinese government-affiliated The Global Times wrote that:\n\u201cThe controversy surrounding Disney\u2019s forced inclusion of minorities in classic films is not about racism, but its lazy and irresponsible storytelling strategy,\u201d stated the op-ed. \u201cMany Chinese netizens said that like Snow White, the image of the mermaid princess in Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s fairy tales has long been rooted in their hearts and it takes a leap of imagination to accept the new cast.\u201d\n\nI think I\u2019ll just leave these links here:\n\nhttps://variety.com/2015/film/news/star-wars-china-poster-controversy-john-boyega-1201653494/amp/\n\nhttps://www.hrw.org/news/2021/02/18/covid-blackface-tv-chinas-racism-problem-runs-deep\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8914295/",

But she does have a very unique star face that makes her recognisable. \n\nAs for Halley Bailey, she's a beautiful girl. But she's also quite generic looking in my opinion. Regardless, I gave her a chance and watched the movie. To be honest, the movie was just honestly bad.",

She is pretty but not conventionally pretty, which means that there will be (and there is) more divisive opinions on wether she is pretty or not.\nThe hair choice as you can see is received as \"i love it, so original etc...\" to \"it looks messy\" \"the washed up orange color is ugly, looks like poop\". Personally i got used to it, but the eye gap kinda weirded me out at first, and the visible scar didn't get covered up, it's not just me those are features that some might find charming or cute, but it isn't conventionally liked. Again my or your personal opinion is irrelevant, as stastistically speaking, conventional doesn't care for personal opinion. \n\nAlso doesn't help that disney didn't give her a dress that would make people go \"wow\", the blue dress also has mixed reception, and don't get me started as her \"becoming a human walk out of the water scene\" being deleted and having her show up in her same blue dress but messy. With some effort they could have heavily skewed the overrall non conventional features positively. \n\nHalle, according to me is pretty. But not in a conventional pretty way. Not a fit for a disney princess cast. Look at the girl who plays Vanessa, she is conventionally pretty, and somehow despite being on screen for a total of 5 minutes, Disney put more effort into her wardrobe than the main girl. If i were to put on tinfoil hat on my head, i would think they Disney sabotaged Halle on purpose.\n\nHave you seen the average hollywood celibrity without makeup and nice outfits? They look like shit to most because we re so used to seeing them all glamed up! They're regular people, not gods or godesses but what most have in common is that they have many conventional beauty traits and then  add movie/red carpet magic. That's what i expect for a Disney Princess.",

That means flawless skin (no scars) or obvious stuff like an ugly nose or crooked teeth. Also, the hair wasn't the beautiful vibrant red we know Ariel for, they couldn't even do that even with the different styling of dread locks? Where did  that vomit  like orange come from and who had this stupid idea? Even better, it cost 150k to make.\n\nAlso, justifying the casting to the singing voice of the actress... it's true her voice is amazing, but not enough to get past the look for some. Also that's kinda hilarious since Ariel is the princess that is mute for almost half her movie, which is why they also shouldn't have overlooked good acting skills in their choice, because that is needed especially for Ariel when voice doesn't work anymore lol",

In East Asia, dark skin isn\u2019t seen as attractive, that has nothing to do with race - but I get it, unfortunately many people are euro- or us- or Africa centric and get this point wrong. \n\nIn Thailand for example, huge tv market! \nBrillant actresses with darker skin, don\u2019t play the pretty, cute heroine, maybe the smart friend or the villain. \n\nOh there\u2019s also a good chance that they\u2019ll think you stink. People in Thailand and other countries in East Asia are way more sensitive to body odore and it\u2019s a very important part of beauty standards - typical body odore from people from India going west to USA aren\u2019t seen as very attractive.\n\nWith Afro American actors they\u2019re already way more openminded than with their peers - as someone mentioned earlier, young Halle Berry in the role would have had success. Will smith is beloved etc. but dark skin, scar on the face (another no go for East Asian cultures) certain face shape\u2026 it simply doesn\u2019t fit. And that\u2019s not racist, it\u2019s a beauty standard that we (some of us) don\u2019t share and can\u2019t understand.

Not only do I not care to be represented, it would bother me to see white people in a samurai movie. It would be so ... weird.\n\nThe same goes for Chinese fantasy - I love the Sorcerer and the White Snake, for instance, the 2011 version is one of my favorite fantasy movies. I couldn't watch a remake with white people in it. And yes, it's a fantasy, but it would still seem fake. The same for the Monkey King - a very popular Chinese character: I think Netflix made a series about the Monkey King that also had some white people in it (and it was in English, of course), and I wasn't even curious - there are already good Chinese takes on it.",

I still went to the movies to watch it, and the casting was even worse than I expected because they cast Takeshi Kitano as the police chief and he spoke Japanese while the white cast spoke English. And then she meets her mother, a little old Japanese lady speaking fluent Japanese to her English speaking daughter she raised in Japan. I complained about it but that was it, and the world moved on and largely forgot about it. This was the same sort of choice except mermaids do not have a \u201creal\u201d ethnicity, while Monkey King and White Snake both took place in China and were denizens of China. Mermaids would, by virtue of living in the ocean, not be tied to any particular landmass. Also cultural appropriation is a proud tradition, it\u2019s what we do.\n\nFantasy characters are made up and the idea of ownership of intellectual properties is an inherently ridiculous idea. Let go of your addiction to control.\n\nI\u2019m not inconsistent, I say cultural appropriation is an American tradition, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inherently wrong to do. I think there are good and bad ways to go about it, like Sucker Punch making Ghosts of Tsushima based on Japanese history by US developers is a form of cultural appropriation, and the culture being appropriated said \u201cthis is an excellent representation of our culture you have brought to the world, thank you.\u201d When you appropriate a culture and make that culture more popular by your work, they tend to be okay with that level of cultural appropriation. In addition, the stories themselves are public domain, which by law means they are open to be changed, so this idea that someone should control how other people express these stories is absurd, my take is consistent with the law.",

You can believe what you want but no matter how many times you declare that race swaps are bad for such and such reasons, you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s only a problem for people that don\u2019t want to acknowledge people with different skin colors exist. There is no intellectual or principled merit to you position, you just refuse to accept what other people want to do because it doesn\u2019t emotionally feel good to you. \n\nJust accept it, you don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s fine! There is nothing wrong with admitting to yourself or others that you don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s on you to unravel your emotions and understand why you feel that way, I can\u2019t get you there any faster. And yeah I call that racism but it\u2019s fine, there is no such thing as a person incapable of racism, just people that are aware of it and those that aren\u2019t. All these scary labels are nothing but silly little words, just like the skin color of a character is a single attribute.\n\nSee, if we go back to the Cleopatra example, I can see a stronger case for your argument since it deals with actual historical details, but even then we have plays like Hamilton that use race swaps intentionally as part of the storytelling. \n\nThe thing about art is that it doesn\u2019t lack the understanding of how race swapping characters affects audience reaction, but it\u2019s not conducive to the practice and development of art to forbid practices. That emotional reaction from the audience can be an intentional affect, which may elicit discomfort from certain people, and its okay for art to make you uncomfortable.

He took the same basic story and turned it into a Samurai movie. He changed a bunch of other things, too, to make it work in that setting. The result is a stunning master piece that is both a testament of appreciation for the genius of the original, but also an original art work that is completely that is just another proof of the genius of Akira Kurosawa.\n\nThat's what creative people do, they take inspiration and make something their own. Only creatively bankrupt people do race swaps.",

First of all, it\u2019s Disney we\u2019re talking about, they wouldn\u2019t have done this if they didn\u2019t expect to make more money than doing what you expect. No big corporation thinks they are working for the consumer, they set trends and tell consumers what to buy.\n\nSecond, broad appeal just means bland and uncomplicated, let\u2019s not act like business is an art form; the general consumer has no taste and artists have to work around people\u2019s lack of taste to sell them shit. If it ever seems like a plot is holding your hand, it\u2019s because the writer thinks the audience needs its hand held.",

People aren't happy with it because the film was a remake of an iconic film with a white character with bright red hair. There were people who were annoyed that live action Ariel's hair wasn't red enough. Is that also racist too? If it was a brand-new character, I'm sure most people would've been fine with it since it's not changing an iconic pre-existing character. The only people who would still be upset are the truly racist ones. \n\nYou'll probably use the argument that \"oh, her race was never important to the story\" or that \" the historical race of real mermaids, etc\", but does it matter? The Wakanda from Black Panthers are black. They're fictional. Does that mean it's okay to suddenly change their race years later because their skin colour was never important to the story or that the race is fictional so there's no actual skin colour in real life based on Wakandan?",

While domestically further instilling the idea that the left is pushing a extreme woke agenda, and thus causing more divide and racial tension. All part of overall plan to systematically oppress the rising black population, so that they would not be accepted both domestically and internationally, using culture and propaganda to further a hidden agenda is a real thing you know. You have to remember, that just because someone says they have your backs, it isnt always so, in fact, the entire agenda of pushing race to the forefront as the utmost social issue, might actually be akin to pushing minorities such as the african american population into a firepit. Even if African Americans were to gain a foothold in terms of complete equality in the United states, they would never be seen in a similar manner internationally, because other ethnicities simply think the white man handed them everything, thus the ultimate power still rests in the white population. A lot of people in Asia already think racism in the United States is a stupid topic, and that this debt that white people owe has nothing to do them, but somehow they are being forcefed woke agenda, this is why there is such a backlash against recent castings in films from hollywood internationally.",

If you say Disney is pushing an agenda, so are you, why do you think your agenda is better than theirs? Maybe yours is the ideology that people deny for good reason?\n\nAs for me, I know for a fact there are no special people now or ever, hierarchical society is made up, and everyone should get to choose how to live their own life not just those you think worthy of the privilege.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like or approve of what Disney does, nor are you entitled to tell them how to run their own business. It\u2019s impossible for them to be 4 steps ahead because even if they tried, they\u2019d still just be regular fallible human beings like everyone else, and all their plans are likewise fallible and prone to failure.\n\nI don\u2019t even like Disney, no corporation should have as much control as politicians willingly gave to them for money, but once that control is lawfully given it\u2019s theirs to keep lawfully. The way you support government institutions violating the laws to get to corporations you don\u2019t like is unconstitutional. Just on principle alone I have to push back against government corruption and overreach that you gleefully support based on theories you know you can\u2019t prove, so don\u2019t be surprised when your lack of evidence doesn\u2019t convince anyone that actually thinks for themself.",

If you can get past Disney\u2019s attempt to go \u201cwoke\u201d, then you will enjoy it. The main actress absolutely killed all of the singing scenes, and seemed to get better as the movie went on. \n\n*the theater wasn\u2019t packed but I\u2019d say it was 70% african american. It was adorable how excited some or these little kids were. I never really thought about representation and thought it was a weird reach by disney.\n\n*biggest issue was Disney switching the gender of the seagull and a bs rap (probably for kids) with the seagull and sebastian.\n\n*flounder was a bit scary looking.",

They improved certain parts but they also downgraded certain parts and added in unnecessary bits (e.g. scuttlebut and Prince Eric's solo). At one point, people have to stop blaming the film's failure on racism and just look at the actual script and direction.",

PRC propagandists look for any opportunity to paint western cultural mores and western media (e.g. American films) in a bad light or as inferior. In this case, they are focusing on western \"forced diversity\" (as if Disney is forced to do anything \ud83d\ude44 and Hailey was the perfect casting choice). So y'all need to take these news reports about widespread racist backlash to Little Mermaid (2023) in China with a HUGE grain of salt.\n\nI can't comment on reports of South Korean racist reactions, except that it is also likely being overblown. The Kpop industry is rife with colorism/racism and black cultural appropriation, but I don't equate the Kpop world with everyday, real world South Korea.",

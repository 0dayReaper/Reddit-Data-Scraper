The film is scheduled to have a wide theatrical release next year in North America, followed by its exclusive debut on Cineverse\u2019s\u00a0streaming service\u00a0Screambox.\n\nProduced for\u00a0less than $250,000, \u201cTerrifier 2\u201d went on to make $15 million at the worldwide box office. It also became a much-discussed viral sensation, as fans took to social media to share the parts that disgusted them most.\n\nAfter its theatrical run, \u201cTerrifier 2\u201d went to Screambox and \u201csubstantially\u201d increased subscriptions, according to the company.\n\n\u201cIt achieved revenues of roughly 60 times the production cost and was powered almost exclusively by social marketing,\u201d Cineverse chairman and CEO Chris McGurk said in a statement. \u201cWe are thrilled that Damien and Phil have chosen to stay true to the franchise and keep the film uncut and independent vs. going the studio route. We aim to make this film the centerpiece of our releasing strategy which is focused on creator-friendly collaboration to generate fan-favorite franchises and remakes that work theatrically and drive streaming subscription revenues. This time, we are planning a wide theatrical release for \u2018Terrifier 3\u2019 as we are confident that the film will deliver yet another unparalleled horror experience. We eagerly anticipate the creative vision that Damien and Phil will unleash upon audiences when we bring \u2018Terrifier 3\u2019 to the big screen in the fall of 2024.\u201d\n\nThe rights agreement was negotiated by Brandon Hill, director of acquisitions, on behalf of Cineverse, and by Priscilla Ross Smith of The Coven on behalf of the filmmakers. Leone is currently represented by WME.",

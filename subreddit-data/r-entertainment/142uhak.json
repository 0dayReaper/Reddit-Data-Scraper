            "comment": "Steven Spielberg\u00a0has always been a father figure to\u00a0Drew Barrymore, but he actually said no when Barrymore asked him to be her real father during the making of their 1982 classic \u201cE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\u201d Barrymore was only 7 years old at the time.\n\nIn a new Barrymore profile\u00a0published by Vulture, Barrymore praised Spielberg as \u201cthe only person in my life to this day that ever was a parental figure.\u201d He eventually agreed to be her godfather. Barrymore\u2019s own father, the actor John Drew Barrymore, was an abusive alcoholic.\n\n\u201cTalk about someone who was not a careerist,\u201d Barrymore said. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I will burn this fucking dynasty to the ground.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring the making of \u201cE.T.,\u201d Spielberg made it his top priority to preserve the magic of the title character for the young Barrymore. In other words, she thought E.T. was real and he wanted to keep it that way. A couple weeks into filming, Barrymore noticed several men operating E.T. and demanded they leave set.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to burst the bubble,\u201d Spielberg said. \u201cSo I simply said, \u2018It\u2019s okay, E.T. is so special E.T. has eight assistants. I am the director, I only have one.\u201d\n\nSpielberg also kept operators on hand during non-filming hours such as lunch breaks so that Barrymore could eat with E.T. As Vulture reports, Barrymore even stayed with Spielberg \u201con weekends; he gave her a cat she named Gertie and took her to Disneyland and Knott\u2019s Berry Farm.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Barrymore\u2019s personal life was in the early stages of spiraling due to her abusive father. She\u2019s been vocal about starting marijuana use at age 10 and snorting cocaine at 12. She also checked into rehab at that age. When she was 7 and making \u201cE.T.,\u201d Barrymore would come to set wearing red lipstick and Spielberg would tell her to take it off.\n\n\u201cShe was staying up way past her bedtime, going to places she should have only been hearing about, and living a life at a very tender age that I think robbed her of her childhood,\u201d Spielberg told\u00a0Vulture. \u201cYet I felt very helpless because I wasn\u2019t her dad. I could only kind of be a consigliere to her.\u201d\n\nSpielberg and Barrymore remain close to this day.",

Generational abuse gets passed on from one to the next all the time. \n\nI do think there's a point where you are accountable for yourself though, and that's when you become the abuser. It's no longer about the trauma you went through, it's about gratifying yourself through abusing others. Maybe the motivation stems from the trauma, but it's still your choice to abuse someone else.",

He had no obligation to accommodate Drew in the way that he did, but he still consistently went out of his way to ensure her well-being. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough situation to be in- knowing a child that is actively in an abusive household. You can directly intervene and get CPS involved, but there\u2019s a chance they won\u2019t find concrete enough evidence to separate the child from the parents, at least not immediately. Now that already abused child is going to be blamed and punished by the parents for speaking out, and they\u2019ll likely be cut off from revisiting the trusted adults that reported the abuse to begin with.\n\nObviously, if you see/hear/suspect child abuse it should be reported immediately, but it\u2019s a very tough call to make unless there\u2019s very solid evidence that can presented/found to ensure the child is removed from that environment as quickly as possible. Abusers can be very good at covering up the damage they inflict.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say Spielberg is necessarily justified in not directly intervening with her home life, but I wouldn\u2019t doubt that he put great thought into how he approached the situation.",

He had little to do with her acting career.\n\nDrew was raised by her mother Jade. Jade was the original Dina Lohan or Kris Jenner. She put her own needs before her child. Jade was routinely seeing going to studio 54 and other clubs of the day with Drew when Drew was still elementary school age. This was because Jade wanted to be famous. She loved the limelight and used Drew to have the connections she wanted.\n\nBacking up a step, John Barrymore was never the actor he was expected to be. By all accords, he was relatively unsuccessful, compared to his own father and his daughter. As a result, he suffered financially. Compiled with substance abuse and mental illness, which plagued the entire family, his marriage with Jade was a mess.\n\nJade fully used the Barrymore name to get Drew in the door. She is the Barrymore name for herself and continue to go by Barrymore for years. \n\nDrew has openly talked about the difficult relationship she has with her mother, and has said she will probably never speak about all of it until after her mother has passed away. If you have not write watched Drew interview, Jennette McCurdy, I highly recommend it it is both eye-opening and inspiring to see Drew moved by another actress who suffered a substantial amount of abuse, because her parents were not looking out for her. \n\nDrew Barrymore is truly a unique soul. She has broken an abuse cycle that has been chronicled for 100 years in her family. While she fell victim to some of the same demon other  members of her family did, she was able to see the light and get out. I truly wish her nothing but the best and believe that she truly is our very own flower child.",

So they are putting adoption on hold for now while they search for another child to adopt. \n\nI was angry.

Have her on set working, away from school and peers for God knows how long? Emotionally manipulated her into bonding with a puppet?  Made her permanently famous? \n\nHow is any of this not also exploitation?\n\nIt wasn't just her parents who exploited her.",

The only part related to filming is about the efforts he took to ensure she could still believe that ET was real. What do you think he should have done differently? And why do you imagine that being \u201caway from school and peers\u201d was the problem? How would her being home have prevented her actor father from taking her to late night parties and giving her coke? Really not understanding your take and curious what you see that I may have missed.",

Mostly unsubstantiated but if true, it seems he did more for her than almost anyone else at the time, related or otherwise",

I don't know if she ever actually lived with him (I really hope not), but I'm pretty sure that Spielberg was the person who helped her get into rehab around that time, which definitely makes him more of a parent than the people with the legal claim to it had, especially at that point.",

(I haven't read her book, but did she even have peers as friends at that point, or was she even going to school? I've never gotten the impression that her parents paid much attention to her stability or lack thereof...) He didn't \"emotionally manipulate\" her into loving E.T.; he saw how she already felt and decided to play along and make her happy.  As for being famous, given that she was a Barrymore to begin with, that ship pretty much sailed right after she was born; she was going to be famous one way or another, but at least she had fun making the movie and spending time with her eventual godfather who genuinely cared about her and did what he could to protect her. (I'm also thinking of Mara Wilson having Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman looking out for her while her mom was dying, and how comforting having them around must have been at such a time.)\n\nDon't assume that everyone in showbiz is a horrible exploiter--yes, there are plenty of them out there taking advantage of people of all ages, but there are other people who try to do what they can to look after others, especially kids.",

            "comment": "Michael Keaton\u00a0and\u00a0Tim Burton\u00a0is a combination one can\u2019t have enough of and rightfully so. The two first collaborated on the 1988 feature\u00a0Beetlejuice\u00a0which left the audience in awe and wanting more. Despite\u00a0Beetlejuice 2\u00a0being co-written by Burton with\u00a0Jonathan Gems\u00a0following the success of the original feature,\u00a0the movie stayed in development hell for decades\u00a0only getting an official announcement this year in May with the acclaimed director helming a script co-written by\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0scribes\u00a0Alfred Gough\u00a0and\u00a0Miles Millar\u00a0and Keton returning to his iconic role. In a recent chat with\u00a0Empire Magazine, the actor praised the \"handmade\" nature of the project.\n\nAll the details about the project are being tightly kept under wraps but the return of\u00a0cast members like\u00a0Winona Ryder\u00a0confirms it\u2019s going to be a direct sequel set in contemporary times. \"Beetlejuice is the most f--kin\u2019 fun you can have working. It\u2019s so fun, it\u2019s so great. And you know what it is? We\u2019re doing it exactly like we did the first movie,\" Keaton revealed, before adding a small visual tease of the highly-anticipated sequel, saying:\n\n\"There\u2019s a woman in the great waiting room for the afterlife literally with a fishing line \u2013 I want people to know this because I love it \u2013 tugging on the tail of a cat to make it move.\"\n\nA sequel was always in the works for the actor and director it was only a matter of time\u00a0before all the right aspects come together. \"[Burton] and I were talking about it years and years ago, never telling anybody. I said, \u2018if it happens, first of all, we\u2019ve both said we\u2019re doing it many times. We both agreed, if it happens, it has to be done as close to the way we made it the first time,\u201d Keaton said.\n\nThe movie is currently in production and Keaton dished out some details of the director\u2019s vision who often loves to construct the world the movie is set in. He said like the original feature they\u2019re \u201cMaking stuff up, making stuff happen, improvising and riffing, but literally handmade stuff like people creating things with their hands and building something. F--kin\u2019 great. It\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve had working on a movie in I can\u2019t tell you how long.\"\n\nThe sequel has a delicious cast lined up with\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0star\u00a0Jenna Ortega\u00a0set to play Lydia's daughter, Catherine O'Hara reprising her role as Delia Deetz,\u00a0Monica Bellucci\u00a0joining the cast as Beetlejuice's wife, as well as\u00a0Justin Theroux\u00a0and\u00a0Willem Dafoe,\u00a0are cast in undisclosed roles. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nBeetlejuice 2\u00a0will be in cinemas on September 6, 2024.\u00a0",

            "comment": "Thomas Kail, the Tony Award-winning director of Broadway\u2019s\u00a0Hamilton, has been tapped to direct\u00a0Disney\u2019s live-action take\u00a0on the studio\u2019s 2016 animated musical sensation\u00a0Moana.\n\nDisney announced the remake earlier this spring and has secured Dwayne Johnson to return to the role of Maui, the grandiose demigod of the wind and sea.\n\nJohnson is producing via his Seven Bucks Productions along with Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia. Beau Flynn is also producing via Flynn Picture Co.\n\nJared Bush, who wrote the screenplay for the original movie, penned the remake, along with Dana Ledoux Miller.\n\nTaking inspiration from Polynesian myths, Moana told the story of a young woman who disobeys her father, the chief of an island that is dealing with an impending ecological disaster and goes off on a quest to reunite a mystical relic with its owner, a goddess named Te Fiti. Along the way, she releases Maui from his island prison, is captured by a monstrous crab, and finds the strength to become the chief her father believed she could be.\n\nPer the studio, the new take is meant to, like its animated predecessor, celebrate the islands, communities and traditions of Pacific Islanders as seen through the eyes of a young woman eager to pave her own path.\n\nAuli\u2018i Cravalho, who voiced Moana in the original, will executive produce with Scott Sheldon of Flynn Picture Co.\n\nKail caught Broadway\u2019s attention when he directed Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s\u00a0In the Heights\u00a0in 2008, earning a Tony for best direction of a musical. He reunited with Miranda in 2015 for\u00a0Hamilton, this time winning the best direction prize while the musical won 11 awards out of the whopping 16 for which it was nominated.\n\nThat brought Hollywood to his door, with the helmer then tapped to direct\u00a0Grease: Live, which earned him two Emmys for direction and producing, and then five episodes of FX\u2019s acclaimed\u00a0Fosse/Verdon\u00a0miniseries, on which he earned an Emmy nomination for outstanding directing and met his now-wife,\u00a0Michelle Williams.\n\nAlthough he directed the filmed staged production of\u00a0Hamilton\u00a0for Disney+ in 2020,\u00a0Moana\u00a0will act as his feature narrative directorial debut.\n\nHe has in no way left Broadway behind and his production of\u00a0Sweeney Todd\u00a0starring Josh Groban and Annaleigh Ashford recently debuted on Broadway to rave reviews. It has received eight Tony nominations, including best revival of a musical.\u00a0",

She\u2019s still young enough to pull it off, I think.  And since most of the voice cast (except the chicken) was of Pacific islander heritage, it does make casting a bit easier.",

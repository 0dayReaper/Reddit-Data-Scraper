But successful films are money printers, and except for a small number of outliers every movie that makes a windfall profit has at least one high-draw name attached. \n\n\u201cActors make too much money\u201d is really a statement about the extreme efficiency with which entertainment reaches hundreds of millions of paying consumers. A single unit product with unlimited future resale potential. They aren\u2019t making millions per shoot just for the performance; that fee is also for marketing appeal, the additional relationships they bring to a project, and for the burden of being a public figure without the same privacy and anonymity we plebs enjoy.",

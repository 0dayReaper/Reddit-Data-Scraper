            "comment": "In the wake of world premiering in Cannes to lackluster film reviews at 50% Rotten,\u00a0Disney/Lucasfilm\u2019s\u00a0Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u00a0is currently looking at a $60M+ domestic opening.\n\nThe movie opens on June 30 heading into what is conceivably a five-day play period given that Independence Day falls on a Tuesday.\n\nDial of Destiny\u2018s 3-day is down from the $100.1M 3-day of the last movie, 2008\u2019s\u00a0Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\u00a0\u2014 and this latest sequel reps the finale for the entire franchise. Crystal Skull opened on a Thursday over a Memorial Day weekend earning in total over five days, $151.9M.\u00a0Logan\u00a0filmmaker James Mangold took over helming the finale from franchise architect Steven Spielberg. Currently,\u00a0Dial of Destiny\u00a0is tracking significantly with older guys over younger, which has many comping he pic to the Daniel Craig 007 finale,\u00a0No Time to Die\u00a0($55.2M) and 2018\u2019s\u00a0Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u00a0($61.2M).\n\nSome are saying a $70M start for\u00a0Dial of Destiny\u00a0\u2014 that\u2019s quite a stretch. Realize that Lionsgate\u2019s\u00a0John Wick: Chapter 4\u00a0opened to $73.8M with double the tracking metrics that\u00a0Dial of Destiny\u00a0is showing here.\n\nDisney will need to pick up the slack in the coming weeks in their marketing to get more interest from younger guys, their distraction now being\u00a0Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u00a0in theaters and the upcoming Warner Bros DC\u00a0The Flash\u00a0on June 16. However, that hard word of mouth out of Cannes is quite the hurdle.\u00a0Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which wasn\u2019t beloved by many, settled at 77% certified fresh and a B CinemaScore versus the previous 1989 installment,\u00a0Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,\u00a0which earned 84% certified fresh from critics and a solid A CinemaScore.\n\nWith\u00a0Dial of Destiny\u00a0at a $60M 3-day, that\u2019s easily the second-best start for the\u00a0Indiana Jones\u00a0franchise. In the box office era,\u00a0Last Crusade\u00a0opened to $29.3M 3-day ($46.9M over extended Memorial Day weekend) at 2,327 theaters. 1984\u2019s\u00a0Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u00a0bowed to $25.3M 3-day ($42.2M extended Memorial Day weekend) at 1,687 theaters. 1981\u2019s\u00a0Raiders of the Lost Ark\u2018s gross trajectory harkens back to the way blockbusters were made over a year: The pic opened to $8.3M at 1,078 theaters and by January 1982 earned $179.6M with an initial cume of $212.2M, lifetime gross of $248.1M.",

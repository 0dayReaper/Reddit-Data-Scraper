Many LGBTQ movies that are celebrated as the best in that category often has so much unnecessary violence/hypersexualization attached to it,it's almost nauseating. I don't even want to start with the toxic stuff that is passed off as romance in the hetero movies. Portrait of a Lady on Fire was such a refreshing watch,one of my personal favorites of all time.",

The story wasn\u2019t about a zombie apocalypse or even about finding a cure, those were just the settings of the story.

Some people found the need to aggressively try and rebuild the order and structure that was missing, some wanted to build a new society different from the old one, some felt compelled to seek a cure, some saw an opportunity to live selfishly and only for themselves, some found meaning in family, some people just wanted to be left alone. It was a very rich world that played out a lot of different coping mechanisms. If you were only interested in Joel and Ellie that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s what resonated with you, but there was a lot of other things to enjoy about the story as well",

I disliked that the school bit was skipped and found the contrast between the relationships bill and Frank have in the game vs the show a little jarring. In the game Frank leaves bill to get a battery to leave the town and meet up with a smuggler to get to the Boston quarantine zone. He ends up getting bitten and hangs himself, then Joel and bill find him later on and find the letter he left bill. In the letter he calls bill and asshole and says dying is better then spending one more day with him. I just would like to have a comprehensive break down on what made them kinda flip this story for the tv show. Perhaps it gives a little more hope in a story that is very bleak overall.",

Full of life. So he served the same purpose as a character in a new an interesting way. And it would be pretty boring if the show was exactly the same as the game.

Bill serves the exact same function in the story but from the opposite end of the spectrum; Instead of a dire warning of what Joel might become if he continues as he is, Bill\u2019s instead a light on what Joel could have if he lets himself heal. It makes the story not merely an adaptation of the original, but an actual companion piece that expands on it. That\u2019s incredibly rare to see. \n\nThe change also serves the incredibly important function of injecting some joy, bittersweet as it is, into a show that without it would have just been straight misery porn. The show does a remarkably good job of examining the  concepts of grief and loss by showing different *kinds* of it with each new set of characters- all of which themselves reflect snd inform Joel and Ellie\u2019s story. The alternate take on Bill and Franks story is an important piece of that. \n\nLastly it subverts the trope of introducing a queer character just to have them suffer and die. Instead we get to see a pair of gay men live out a full and fulfilled life, something hardly ever put on screen. Especially it projects of this size.  \n\nFrom every angle I think they made the absolute best choice with the change.",

Plot drives the story. Obviously, character conflict contributes to it, but in this instance, there was none.

Bill and Frank die and leave the car for them to continue their journey without any obstacle and/or conflict. Like I said, he was a wonderful and complex character.

The actual obstacle isn\u2019t acquiring physical transportation, thats just a background goal to give the story a loose direction, the actual obstacle at the heart of the story is Joel\u2019s inability to face connection, something showcased with him walking away from Tess without a word the previous episode and starting this one refusing to confront what she meant to him. He achieves the background goal of the truck after being pushed to start making a real connection with Ellie and that is done through Bill\u2019s letter, the weight of which the audience feels because of how the episode informed us of his life with Frank. And that weight is reflected in what Joel *could* have had with Tess if he\u2019d let himself open up back then, and what he *can* have with Ellie if he does so now.",

My only point is that when it comes to survival horror, plot should alway trump character arc especially when you simply designated one episode to explain it all. Bill, Joel, and Ellie deserved much more exploration into this theme than just a cut and dry, black and white scenario. Maybe it\u2019s me just being selfish and wanting more Bill. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s hard to understand. Taking care of someone with a terminal illness isn\u2019t that way. Trust me. I know. It\u2019s not easy. There\u2019s a lot of bitterness and resentment you feel towards the world. We could have explored that lore with Bill.",

Loved the game and loved the show, and this was my favorite change between the two.\n\nIn the game, Bill is a DEPRESSING example of what Joel could become. Surviving for nothing, with nobody at all. Driving away anyone who could possibly love him. Game version of Frank abandons Bill as a hopeless maniac and curses him out to his last breath. He quite literally names Bill and his suicide note and says he is a piece of shit. Because Bill remained bitter and realist and destroyed their relationship.\n\nIn the show, Bill is a HOPEFUL example of what Joel could become. They are identical people, the ruthless realists who defend their idealist partners (Frank for Bill, Tess and later Ellie for Joel). Bill has everything he needs to live a long long time in this apocalypse...but his relationship with Frank proves his survival alone would not be a LIFE, and what is the point of survival without a life? \n\nSo Bill saw the light. He realized that Joel has the chance to not just survive, but be happy, if he opened up to Tess the same way Bill opened up to Frank. His letter is a gift from one \"violent motherfucker\" to another to be happy.\n\nThe beautiful tragedy is, **it's too late**. Tess is already dead, and they never had their chance to be anything more because Joel never opened his heart up. Kept it locked tight after losing his daughter.\n\nThis is a critical catalyst for Joel and Ellie. Bill is the closest mindset and personality to Joel that we ever see in the show. If even Bill thinks that Joel should open up and love someone, then Joel knows it's legitimate advice and it's real. Tess is no longer there and there's only one person Joel can live for now, and that's Ellie.\n\nHe continues to become more and more paternal to her from this moment onward. Staying up all night and not waking her up for a shift on watch in the next episode, making sure she's okay after she kills a man in the next episode after that, and so on and so on and so on until he has fully committed to being her \"father\".\n\nThis episode isn't just an expansion of the world, it is a crucial piece of storytelling. \n\nGame version of Bill and Frank is great for the game. Show version of Bill and Frank is great for the show. Overall this episode is a great example of why you need to decide if you SHOULD change things and HOW in an adaptation to another medium.",

It\u2019s like in video games when people choose to read all the non related emails on computers. This is just an expansion on one of those which I thought was great and fun. I enjoy reading those when I play games! \n\nIt was mostly a world building episode that helped set the universe. This episode, to me, mattered because it expanded on the world in a different way. We saw a genuinely happy who had their faith in humanity resorted. This is very different from literally every other thing we\u2019re shown about the world now. Our heroes are jaded and the future is bleak, but the episode showed us that hope and light still exist. It\u2019s their love for one another that influenced Joel and Tess positively in unique ways.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I love that it is two gay men. The apocalypse happened in 2003, that\u2019s prior to gay marriage being legalized and when many states had gay sex criminalized. In this universe, these characters specifically benefited from the apocalypse happening. They would\u2019ve never been truly happy if it didn\u2019t. The series shows how awful life is now, but this specific side story showed that it isn\u2019t all awful. Some people achieved true freedom. It\u2019s a taste of life outside of corruption! \n\nThis episode gave us a more balanced view of the world as it is in the wake of the apocalypse.",

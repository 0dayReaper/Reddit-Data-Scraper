There were moments that just were written for a little lingering, but RR doesn't linger. \n\nCameron doesn't usually even pace his action with action pacing, let alone a whole movie, and it works better for it, in my opinion.",

Yes. Are they still a part of the business model of Hollywood wide theatrical releases? Not really. Since we\u2019ve entered the age of 100-200-300mil+ budgeted films, and an era in which a studio needs to know a film can reach peak awareness in order to sell it to a massive audience (aka huge IP and spectacle) these guys just don\u2019t have the ability to do much outside of smaller films that are either loaded with top tier cast, or are smaller films that are hyper genre specific. \n\nThe reality is that in order for a studio to get behind a film it either needs to be 100mil plus budget with significant built in awareness, a broad script, and at least one massive piece of talent attached (the Rock, Ryan Reynolds, Tom Cruise\u2026) OR it needs to be a 20-25mil film, with a fantastic screenplay/filmmaker, and again a massive piece of talent on board. And even then it\u2019s highly unlikely to get picked up unless the filmmaker is coming off a huge success or critical darling.  OR it\u2019s a sub 20mil horror script form a proven filmmaker/producer. That\u2019s really about all a studio will even think about 99.9% of the time. \n\nQT might be an exception, as he himself is the \u201cbranded IP\u201d similarly to a Nolan or Cameron film. But, he has never expressed a real interest in going for an all out broad audience massive budget style film. If he did, I\u2019m sure studios would perk right up. The flirtation with Star Trek though, shows they aren\u2019t about to just let him take a valuable IP and make it a QT film. \n\nThey operate on the fringes of the industry now. Where as 20years ago they would have been able to pick up the phone and talk to any studio chief in town about what they want to do next (not that that would make it automatic) but that ability really doesn\u2019t exist now. Not for those guys, not for Spielberg, Fincher, Scorsese, Jenkins, Burton, etc\u2026\n\nSpielberg at least still has the gravitas to make films. But even he has had to do some significant IP things in the last few years. BFG, Ready Player One, Westside Story, Indy 4+5, hell even Lincoln is \u201cIP\u201d AND was based on a massively successful book. Going back to 2004, only Munich, War Horse, Bridge of Spies, and The Post are \u201coriginals\u201d (even with a couple being successful books/plays).\n\nHollywood has moved past the filmmaker/a-list model. At least in terms of big wide release theatrical. Which is the context of the original comment. \n\nObviously streaming has opened doors for filmmakers to make some things on a smaller scale or even in limited/ongoing series. \n\nBut they days of audience turning a film into box office smash hit based almost solely on the filmmaker are (at least for now) gone. Since smash hits now have to be international and capable of making 800mil+, there just isn\u2019t an original film from almost any filmmaker out there  that a studio can hedge on for that. \n\nSource: almost 20years in film development and production.",

Had to go research instantly. Such a shame.\n\n&gt;Since smash hits now have to be international and capable of making 800mil+, \n\nYeah, this is what I've heard from multiple sources, studios are flat out refusing to even look at medium films that would certainly turn a profit. Everything has to have the potential to be a major smash hit or you get ignored.\n\nDo you think this trend will continue or will there be a backlash of some sort? Studios crashing down because they backed one too many really expensive bad horse? Just more and more streaming services making those medium movies? The birth of something completely new?",

The filmmakers you are talking about would never have even gotten the green light to do what they did if it weren\u2019t for him.\n\nBefore Jaws summer was the throwaway season where studios would release filler movies that weren\u2019t expected to perform well. Now it\u2019s second only to the end of the year/Christmas season in terms of top releases.\n\nSay what you want about his box office numbers or whatever but in terms of impact on the industry at large he is *at least* on par with Cameron.",

Who remembers Avatar for its interesting story and characters that are excited to go back to theatres to see their continuation of? Is JC going to unveil some big new age techniques that will get the population buzzing about avatar 2 to the same degree? Are we getting 4D movies? The Way of Water comes with a splash zone in theaters?\n\nMaybe it'll just be curiosity that carries the second one or it'll ride the hype of the first. New Avatar? That hugely successful box office titan? Maybe I'll go check it out, but if it doesn't deliver something revolutionary I don't feel it's going to make as much of an impact",

But there's a fantasy there of escapism, on a meta level. Us escaping into a world where people can also escape and ultimately transcend their limitations - isn't that an ultimate fantasy? It tells a story of a wheelchair bound guy who doesn't just learn to walk again. His journey is a big fantastical hook of an underdog story. \n\nBlend that with the fantasy of being able to intimately connect with nature/something larger than yourself, and you have a spiritual fantasy that is a home run for a slew of other people. The spiritual fantasy collides with the evil corporate-consumption-greed machine, totting cool as hell mechs and weapons that make sci-fi needs geek out. Really - the movie had it all. \n\nSure, the story itself wasn't original, but it was served up with unique trappings that pulled everyone into a world where they could imagine themselves as almost any character, and that connection Cameron makes with the audience is why I think the movie was so successful.",

The stories about this kind of stuff that we do get always hedges things, like \"well don't take resistance *too* far\", \"well there are good reasons to try to mine valuable minerals\", \"maybe its all a misunderstanding, let's talk it out in the end\". In Avatar, it didn't really hedge at all - it said nah, fuck imperialism, now let's make the audience cheer as indigenous warriors blow up troop carriers packed with American soldiers.\n\nWith the way global ecological affairs and the climate crisis is developing, I'll take all the unrepentant and unambiguous pro-ecology/anti-imperialist movies I can get",

It was a really interesting set of circumstances.\n\nAlso movies used to measured by number of tickets sold but Gone With the Wind ended that practice too by making an unbeatable record. Titanic has a distant second. Even Avatar down at 5th made it only 75% of the way to the record. Of course Avatar sold lots of expensive 3D tickets which is why it is all the way up to 2nd place in inflation adjusted box office revenue.\n\nLooking forward, if the Chinese market ends up closing itself off to Hollywood (which who knows if they\u2019ll follow through on that), it\u2019s possible we may enter an era where even non-inflation adjusted records may not get broken for a very long time. If that happens box office records may start measuring things in domestic non-inflation adjusted only or even change to some other metric entirely. Either way, studios will be sure to figure out new ways to slice the numbers so they can continue breaking records.",

You can never do things 100% right for them the first time. They're uncomfortable with that and are unwilling to accept it, because it means their own job is meaningless.\n\nSo by intentionally including a bit of your hairy arm sticking in on the side of the graphic, your manager/client will look at it and go \"what's that arm doing here? Get that out of here\" and you can go \"oh whoops! I didn't even notice that\". You get rid of it, the manager thinks they've made their contribution, and you're ready to ship your original idea in the first place.\n\nObviously nowadays a hairy arm probably doesn't work anymore because it's become so cliche, but your friend intentionally including small details the clients won't like is very much in the same vein.",

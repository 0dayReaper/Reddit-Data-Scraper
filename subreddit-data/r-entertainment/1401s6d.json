Would be the perfect cocktail of scandal for Qanon loons to jump on the bandwagon.",

And they\u2019re just trying to make some of it back. If they could have wrote it off for taxes and scrap it like the batgirl movie they probably would\u2019ve. And given the fact they Ezra isn\u2019t on the press tour for the movie kinda seems they don\u2019t have much faith in them",

I\u2019m waiting, but also impressed by how the majority of the comments seem to lean \u201cWB is waiting til the end of the movie\u2019s run.\u201d I haven\u2019t seen any evidence of this being true. I think it will be interesting to examine this case alongside Jonathan Major\u2019s handling after the allegations against him.",

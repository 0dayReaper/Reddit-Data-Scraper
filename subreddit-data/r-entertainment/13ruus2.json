There was a lot of talk about QT doing a samurai movie and I was a little skeptical. But I sat in that movie theatre back then, just totally blown away. Both films are like B12 for the eyes. I remember walking out of the cinema so keyed up and excited for V2. \n\nGoing to the pictures back then was a much different experience. There was usually a jazz man playing an old jangle piano near the curtain in front and all the dialogue was shown on grainy black cards that would pop up during a scene.",

It gave a ground level view of the universe.\n\nAnd it's really losing sight of that in these later season.  The show skipped a whole lotta echelons, and now he's fighting supreme leaders and is in line to be crowned king of all Mandos and even Jesus popped in to save his life at the end of the last season.\n\nI liked the normal side-quests with average aliens just going about their day, not the grand galaxy shaping adventures.",

So many attempts at huge arc that just didn't go anywhere and were forgotten. Plot points set up that went nowhere.  Then capaldi.  I love him as an actor but the writing was terrible and the previous doctors were all so optimistic and gladly defended humanity for it's potential.  Then we have a doctor whos catchphrase was shut up.  While I agree things should be shaken up and changed to keep it new.  The heart and soul of the show was that version of the doctor playful optimistic, maybe one episode battling the daleks and in the next showing Picasso what he meant to everyone.  That was the fun.  Not watching a curmudgeon get angry at everyone and be condescending.",

The theatrical trilogy was beyond amazing and its allure is still in tact. But I do fear that more and more spin-offs will just sorta change the story all together (and my ability to reminisce on the nostalgia of Peter Jackson's films). I did watch Amazon's Ring of Power and I did enjoy it, but there will come a point after a few seasons or even totally different installments where I fear I'll become tired of the LotR universe and any future/multiple adaptations of it.",

It doesn't mention Jedi at all. It goes into how a bureaucracy exists and comes to exist. \n\nMaybe it would have been for the best if Darth Vader's boss weren't a super jedi, but just someone who managed to use The Force to his own benefit. (I think that was an idea somewhere.) \n\nAnd then, the magic twist that \"The Force\" isn't a religion at all, but is essentially a bloodline -- that annoyed me to no end.",

You don't need to sweep the rug out from under them.\n\nIf you can surprise audiences with something that makes sense, that's great, but forcing doesn't just damage the result, it hurts the integrity and importance of everything leading up to it.\n\nReally random example, but one of few things that managed to plot twist me in a good way in the last several years was Moana! The truth of Te Fiti blindsided me, but it made complete sense and I felt like an idiot for missing it.\n\nTHAT'S how you subvert expectations. You gotta make the audience feel like they should've known, or in some cases, that a character was so successfully conniving that they pulled the wool over your eyes, but you gotta make it connect, and too often it doesn't.",

There's so much lore and genuinely great characters and stories that have very little to do with Canon. They should learn from the success of andor and realize that we don't need the fan service throw backs to the main movies.",

That way it's a neat opposite star Wars set up. \n\nThat and I did sort of enjoy the Rey-Kylo relationship (before whatever the fuck they did at the end of Episode 9). That was interesting. That plus making Rey a nobody would have been an excellent plot move if not for the retcon in the next movie. There's so much actually interesting stuff there, but the execution just kinda sucks.",

Both are Mary Sue Characters but Rey was lacking some flaws whereas we see Luke lose over and over. Visually though, the ending was stunning - that is something they have really shined throughout. Even as much as I hate the idea of the Holdo Maneuver - holy crap did that look and sound impressive",

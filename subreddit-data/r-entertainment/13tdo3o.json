            "comment": "That Seinfeld finale has gotten a lotta hate, but it\u2019s a sitcom about nothing (and extremely selfish people.) I don\u2019t understand the hate personally. I assume they did what they thought people would least expect. Thinking on it, what would have been \u2018satisfying?\u2019 to a global audience?\n\n\u201cWho really cares?\u201d is probably the answer the writers came up with.\n\nFine send-off for a series with mostly no running storylines that needed to end in any actually meaningful way.\n\nShout out to Veep tho for being one of the best HBO sitcoms of all time. (She\u2019s not a great fit in the MCU, imo. Love her, but she feels shoehorned in.)",

They weren't all going to find love and love happily ever after, there was no unresolved drama for the characters to overcome. Honestly the only other ending I've been able to conceive is the episode just playing out like another episode then fading to black. People who really hated the ending, please tell me what your pitch for a satisfying final for a show about nothing.",

Hereby, it would create a cycle that underlines this idea that ultimately there is no progress, it's all about nothing.\n\nBtw. I am sure that many would hate this ending as well...",

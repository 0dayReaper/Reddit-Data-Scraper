They all knew and never made amends they all want on their merry way like they didn't know. Except they all knew.\n\nCK always asked and never coerced anyone. What about saying: put that dick back in your pants. Did they think about it? No, they just watched a middle age dude cum on his belly. After he asked and didn't say no. Maybe they even said yes thinking he was joking but when he proceeded to take his dick out. Did they say: man, I thought you were joking!? Guess not. They complained and talk about it behind his back. Never addressing him directly.\nIt never went to court either. Because how they would have justified watching it until the end.\n\nIs he gross? Yes. Did he deserved to be shamed? No, he had sexual kink. He had consent. Didn't threaten anyone on the moment. ( Reminder: afterwards as the women complained to his manager. The manager hold statements that could be perceived as threats. Still no idea of what was said). \n\nHe came back bitter though, I'll give you that just like Chapelle. They aren't as funny anymore.

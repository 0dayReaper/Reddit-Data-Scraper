The OG LOTR movies were only possible because Peter Jackson HIMSELF was able to get the IP rights; they couldn\u2019t strongarm him on production because he was bringing everything to the table.\n\nThis is no longer possible in the age of flagship franchising at major studios.  The executive will always have power over the director because they\u2019re the one allowing the director to work on the IP, while with LOTR, it was Jackson allowing NewLine/WB to use that IP under his vision.\n\nThe closest we\u2019ll get to that level of unmitigated director-led creativity in blockbuster filmmaking is Gunn\u2019s DC Movies, and that\u2019s only because Gunn now has complete control over the entirety of the IP (to an extent) and has a unique voice.  But it\u2019ll still be heavily sanitized because the attitude of modern day franchise movies is to make a fuckload of money, while in the 90s money was still important but it came second to quality filmmaking.",

But for close ups he only used every other frame and played them twice to create 24fps for certain scenes to avoid the soap opera effect that makes things look less cinematic.\n\nSo frames 12345678 became 11335577 for certain scenes to avoid soap opera.",

Turn on motion smoothing and pop in Willy Wonka or something at least 40-50 years old. The TV software will add frames to make a more consistent and higher framrate, but it has the perceptual effect of 'cheapening' the video.",

It can initially feel that way, because the cameras a lot of TV stuff is shot with run at a much higher frame rate than the standard ~24 for movies.\n\nNowadays with most people not even noticing the awful motion smoothing their TV is putting on everything, including 24 fps movies, I doubt too many people would even notice.",

The hobbit trilogy felt lifeless almost anytime there was a CG anything. Remaking the trilogy is such a bad move and I can't see how they could make me want to go see it.",

Instead the last movie is the equivalent of an hour long  Total Warhammer RTS fight of a bunch of CGI armies aimlessly smacking each other to entertain the audience and genuinely fun action sequences (River barrel scene) feel dragged out or have too many unnecessary elements (Legolas and the OC elf )",

Some movies seem to be endlessly remade, like there have been so many Batmen (90s-Now), 3 Spidermen.  Yet other movies like the original Star Wars have not been remade.\n\nI agree its tiresome though, I predict its going to draw a lot of controversy both because people hate change and it being a potential money grab on the studios part.  I will not say it is impossible for it to be good, it will just be annoying to follow regardless of whether its good or not because of the controversy it will generate.",

Wizard into world is in a panic.\n\nTwist is it\u2019s just a normal muggle guy doing a straight vengeance rampage. His younger sister went to Hogwarts from a muggle family. But in contrast to say, Harry\u2019s Aunt, our antihero thought it was the coolest thing ever and doted on his little sis\u2026.until she died during the Voldemort reign of terror being a muggle. Last few years have been a decade buildup to his rampage: a stint in the SAS, gathering magical contacts and using what little magical things he can do as a muggle like magical items or potions he buys. Had to confront whether this whole thing is justice or he just enjoys the violence now. And he\u2019s rapidly deciding that he needs to end the secret veil of wizard superiority. \n\nHarry is forced to grapple with the ethics of maintaining order and rapidly these victims are becoming less \u201cunsympathetic\u201d as the anti hero goes down the list.

The practical effects were great in the original LOTR and way better than CGI for these kind of movies, imo. I\u2019m sure there are improvements in that field since the ring of power orcs looked pretty good. \n\nOther thing is the movies were filmed on 35mm and then converted to digital. I\u2019m not savvy enough to know what degree of improvement that would be if they used more modern filming techniques, other than I think super 4k ultra and stuff. \n\nI\u2019d rather them reshoot the movies basically same major plot points captured how they were and then include a bit more of the frolicking the books have compared to the more action film orientation of the movies. I loved both the books and films. I also want glorfindel to be the badass he\u2019s supposed to be and more range from Aragorn since he wasn\u2019t initially kingly\n\nEdit - I\u2019m enjoying everyone\u2019s comments on film technology.

According to [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm) it sounds like he sold the rights to a studio and the studio hired someone to write the script. At some point Tolkien called the writer and the writer told him it was going to be a live adaptation instead of animated, which Tolkien preferred. I\u2019m not seeing anything about him agreeing to those other changes.\n\nBased on Tolkien\u2019s history of trying to get the books adapted to film, it sounds like he was skeptical about it working but wanted the money so that his wife could be taken care of. He was in his late 70s around this time, so I don\u2019t think he expected he\u2019d get to see any of these movies",

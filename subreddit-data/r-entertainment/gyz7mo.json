She told me that even as a kid, she knew there was business and other places that she would told to leave if she went in because she was Jewish. It really astounded me, and still does, because I have been privileged enough to be considered white by strangers my entire life. In fact, when I tell people I\u2019m a Jew, people often seem to assume my family is at least somewhat wealthy and well-educated. Stereotypes are a very odd thing.",

I think the reason people think of Jews this way and not Anglo Saxons is that Jews have a smaller population but still a huge amount of representation, so it\u2019s easy to remember the Rothschilds but forget about people like the Rockefellers and Waltons even though they probably have more control in total. Anglos have less control per capita. They also overwhelmingly made up the founders so it maybe doesn\u2019t stick out so much. \n\nOne interesting connection I made is how the term WASP kind of functions like the word Jew in that it\u2019s ethnoreligious, to the point where someone could be an atheist and still be referred to as WASP because it\u2019s more a description of common lineage than something that you can check 3 boxes off and be in the group. Idk if this makes sense, my point is it\u2019s analogous to how a Jew could be an atheist and half not jewish but they still are seen as Jewish",

You can be non English and be Mormon, but I\u2019m non Mormon and personally, Mormon describes my ethnicity and to some extent culture. You can tell. Idk I think we compartmentalize ethnicity, language, and religion when to some extent they are deeply tied. \n\nTotally off topic from OP but things like ethnogenesis and linguistics fascinate me. Traveling made me aware of this. Idk, just patterns I notice though, I have no actual proof of this, but I think on a broad level of connections and archetypes more than specific and scientific. Identity is multifaceted and sometimes intimately connected to other parts of identity",

He was a caring and attentive parent/husband.  You could tell he loved his children and family very deeply, and was always kind and polite even during disagreements with producers on the staff, other anchors,etc.  Rachel Maddow\u2019s first time on MSNBC was as a talking head on his show. They really liked each other. I left news many years ago (Thank God), he floated around as a pundit, and eventually landed on Fox News spewing his new alt- right garbage. I never agreed with him politically, but knew him personally, and could sort of square his world view through in depth conversation one on one or in a small group.  It was never as extreme as what he says now... ever. I have no idea what happened. Maybe he was always this person and hid it away from me?  Maybe he simply saw an opportunity to be relevant again after Jon Stewart eviscerated him on Crossfire many years ago and fed into being an extremist to serve the Fox audience?  He has a strained relationship with his biological mother and I think that subconsciously scarred him in some way.  His rhetoric has swayed from \u2018something I disagree with\u2019 to downright \u2018nasty and dangerous\u2019 quite a while ago...People are fucking weird.",

Political advertisers and operatives for decades have known that the two most important psychological factors attracting people to conservatism are [Authoritarianism and Social Dominance Orientation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40646407?seq=1). Understanding these two factors explain and predicts the vast majority of political preferences.\n\nOne consequence of this is that conservatives place much higher moral value on [loyalty to the group, obeisance to the leader, and protecting the hierarchy](https://moralfoundations.org/) which is why they will so ardently follow the leader. They do not have as much internal consistency of opinion, so much as they have internal consistency over who to follow. [Here's a link to a collection of nearly 50 different opinion polls comparing changes in opinion of Democratic and Republican respondents over the years.](https://imgur.com/a/YZMyt). \n\nWe see campaign leaders like Steve Bannon and Dominic Cummings relying on this for their own internal models. Conservative campaign strategies have changed dramatically, it's no longer about uniting the country so much as it is about rallying your base using microtargetting and creating internal divisions in a technique known as political wedging. For a good book on how they do this see [\"The Victory Lab\"](http://www.thevictorylab.com/).\n\nIf you want to know more, I recommend reading \"The Authoritarians\" by Bob Altemeyer, with foreword by John Dean, white house advisor to Nixon.

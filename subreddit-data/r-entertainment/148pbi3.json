When they wanted to bring Cavill back for Black Adam, Warner told them not to and were still deciding if he had a future with the universe. They did it anyway, the film bombed, and Cavill was let go. He fired Garcia the following week. \n\nWarner basically cut ties with Johnson and Garcia after the movie flopped, blaming their egos and demands for Shazam and BA alike.",

Discovery CEO David Zaslav and Warner Bros. Pictures heads Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, Warners has an intense desire to reprise the Cavill iteration of the hero. The project that would essentially be Man of Steel 2 is being produced by Charles Roven and is currently searching for writers. (There is a wishlist, of course. And Christopher McQuarrie, the hand that guides the Mission: Impossible movies was on it. McQuarrie worked with Cavill on the 2018 installment, Fallout, but sources say no official outreach has been made nor may it be feasible, as the director is working on the next back-to-back M:I installments.)\n\nWarner then announced on Dec 15 that the sequel was cancelled, right after Black Adam lost them over a hundred million dollars.",

Going forward she'll be the main character in the show and Geralt and Yen act as supporting characters. He himself said that in an interview. But he should've known the creators intended for that to happen as they're following the books, and not the game in the slightest. Being a supporting character doesn't really suit him as he's a megastar and that's understandable but one can't help but wonder if he would've stayed as supporting cast, if it wasn't for the Superman lure..? Or maybe he indeed does have bigger projects in line as a lead and quit bc of that.",

It\u2019s why Harvey Weinstein went so long without people do anything. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to speak up about the top paid actor being a dick. But now actors have and they had good reason to be. Look into all the stuff the rock did with DC. He screwed over lots only because of his own ego and self worth. \n\nI get the dude seems like a swell dude. Like I said I bet I\u2019d love meeting him. I have done grunt work on stuff before and those crew people are also fans. Which like I said he isn\u2019t a dick to. But he will gladly ruin a few franchises for his own self worth.",

They\u2019ve had to bench the star and title character of the film in favor of boosting the hell out of Keaton and Supergirl and then invited/paid such a broad array of celebrities to attend screenings and praise the film. Given how long this movie has been in development and how much of a rollercoaster the marketing has been, I feel like the real budget is quite a bit higher than what some are reporting. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me if this has to make close to, or above, 800m to break even",

Police were unable to find her, with Miller telling officials she hadn\u2019t lived at the farm for months. Police reportedly suspected Miller was helping the woman \u201cevade service\u201d of the order. According to an affidavit written by a caseworker with the Vermont Department for Children and Families, the mother put up social-media posts from the farm in late July, and Rolling Stone reports she was posting almost daily from the farm until her account appeared to have been deleted around mid-July.\" ([Source](https://www.thecut.com/article/ezra-miller-allegations.html))",

I personally don\u2019t care, I\u2019m more than happy to just hand wave it away and not think logically about it\u2026but there will inevitably be those who complain about it.",

Plus, I don\u2019t think it fit Gunn\u2019s current plans for his DCU. Main reason why The Flash is even a thing is because the movie\u2019s main purpose is to reboot the DCEU and usher in the DCU. Which is the same thing the Flashpoint Paradox (the comic that they\u2019re basing the movie on) did for the comics, since after that DC basically relaunched all their titles under the New 52 label. They\u2019re pretty much doing the same thing just with their movies now.",

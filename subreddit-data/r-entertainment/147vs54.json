It\u2019s unfortunate you don\u2019t have an ear for good music.  It\u2019s a damn good cover, proven by reception it received and the fact it\u2019s doing better than the original.\n\nAnd, by the way, you commented on a post highlighting Luke Combs cover of fast car and referred to it as crappy writing- not me.",

            "comment": "This was one of those scandals that was always more smoke than actual fire. He texted cannibalistic sex fantasies with his mistresses / side pieces, who enthusiastically texted back. He was open for years about being into extreme BDSM and domination and would talk about it in regular interviews going back to the Social Network. Kinky, but not criminal. \n\nHe cheated on his wife with women who also wanted to act out these extreme situations and were active participants. The problem was that they all thought they were his only mistress. Asshole, but not criminal. \n\nThey then found out about each other and that\u2019s when the shit hit the fan. But if you read all of the communications, both before and after, he had with these side pieces, there\u2019s no indication that there was ever a withdrawal of consent, or a lack of eager participation. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite. It was all pre-agreed upon extreme kink that was sometimes arranged by the accuser(s). \n\nThe worst thing it appears he did was cheat on his wife, and lead these women to believe he cared for them and allow them to think there was something more there. He was using multiple women for casual role-play and they didn\u2019t appreciate it when they found out they were one of many disposable partners. Asshole, but not criminal.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s no actual accusation that he was a cannibal, just that he liked to talk dirty about it. Again, extremely kinky, but not criminal.",

But it doesn\u2019t seem like he actually deliberately harmed anyone. I think I got less caught up in the headlines of this scandal because, having read some of his interviews over the years previously, he literally couldn\u2019t get through a feature on himself without mentioning he was into domination. For whatever reason, it never made headlines before the scandal, but not for lack of him speaking out on it. So when I first heard about the accusations I assumed he took some of his fantasies that he was clearly obsessed with too far. But then you read the actual evidence, and there\u2019s like\u2026 nothing there? It\u2019s all talk and mutually agreed upon role-play. Bizarre.",

The DA said in their statement that they\u2019re dropping  the case because it is hard to prove the encounter was not consensual. They used that reasoning because the accuser both apparently arranged this specific rape role-play session and then messaged him and others positively about it afterwards. So it\u2019s not lack of evidence, the issue is that the evidence indicates that it *was* consensual.\n\nYou have to dig deep to get facts in this case. I understand why, we don\u2019t want to discourage victims from coming forward. But when the accuser is lying, society\u2019s new approach to reporting on cases like this (where accusers are always assumed to be truthful), causes issues because people don\u2019t include all the facts that make the accuser look like a liar.",

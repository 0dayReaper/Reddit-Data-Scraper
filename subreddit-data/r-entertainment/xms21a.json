It was after the thing was over and they were walking away and seen Cena visiting with a few other wrestlers. My nephew said \"you can't see me\" and Cena laughed then came over and took a few pictures and visited for a few minutes and gave him his hat, and his sweatbands. My nephew still has them.",

He had his \"5 moves of doom\" and spent years burying other wrestlers and basically being the Hulk Hogan of the Ruthless Aggression and PG eras of WWE. \n\nBut when he gets paired with a good wrestler who isn't afraid to shot-call with him, he's definitely shown to be one of the best wrestlers in the business. See any of his matches with CM Punk, AJ Styles, or any of his U.S. Open Challenge matches. That is peak-performance from Cena, and most of that was at a later-age for him.",

Found it very interesting, especially how highly he was spoken of.",

It was one of those that was so good my partner and I got excited for each episode, it even ended up on work chats.\n\n\nI don't think anyone else has linked it but here's the intro: https://youtu.be/_mrr3UNALww it's missing the Eagly scream but tbh, if you're going to actually watch the show I'd wait for the first time it hits. When watching the first episode I turned to my partner and said, if this is the intro I'm never skipping it.\n\n\nFun fact, James Gunn hired a choreographer named Charissa Barton to do this. They had to do this during lockdowns / isolation, which is how James Gunn surprisingly found out that her husband is actually Alan Tudyk (Wash from Firefly) because he got videos of Alan demoing all the dances.",

But to see him come back to put over Roman kinda hurt me.    I had to stop myself from turning the stream off after i saw Roman kick out of a top rope AA/FU,   at that point everyone knew what was going to happen...    After all we've seen,  you don't kick out of that.",

His Mandarin is better than most of the other non natives I've known that actually spent a year or two living/working over there. It's nowhere near proficient, but it's better than any other non Chinese westerner I've ever heard that hasn't actually lived there. Aside from Laoshu (RIP).\n\nYou listen to Cena as opposed to Zuckerburg, whose wife is Chinese, and I feel like you could tell a huge different even without knowing the language at all. It's honestly like nails on a chalkboard listening to most people try to speak at a level way beyond their capability in situations like that where it's definitely not needed or even asked for.",

Also more than 50% of wishes granted are to a Disney park (the closest one to where they live) and those are very expensive.\n\nMAW does pay Disney for these trips, but Disney is an *amazing* partner that provides a special experience just for make a wish families that would normally cost more than what the foundation pays. They get a private handler for the entire time and special accessible rooms that can  accommodate large medical equipment, plus all the behind the scenes experiences, character meetings, castle tours, fast passes, etc. The logistics that Disney is willing to put into it to make it special is really impressive. They\u2019ll even tailor the experience for the individual child if they have physical restrictions.",

However, many are undergoing treatments &amp; could go either way. I had a few wish kids that passed away, it was a tough pill to swallow so I had to take a mental break from volunteering. \n\nRay wished to go to Hawaii with his family &amp; it was a great memory for his family to carry forward after he passed away. Evan had to have his dominant arm amputated due to cancer &amp; wished for a shipping trip. He wanted a set of golf clubs to learn how to golf with one arm. The kid inspired the hell out of me &amp; still does!  I\u2019ll definitely never forget a lot of those kids.",

It\u2019s a volunteer role &amp; you basically do the legwork/paperwork meeting with the family/wish kid. \n\nDepending on the wish it can involve more interaction like teenagers like to do shopping wishes which you organize &amp; go with them &amp; their family to shop &amp; pay for everything then take them out to lunch at a restaurant they choose. \n\nLots of the little kids want to go to Disney, which isn\u2019t as involved for the volunteer. \n\nHad a kid who wished to meet KISS, he got to go fly out to Utah &amp; go to their concert. If I remember he got to meet them (or at least one or two). \n\nCelebrity wishes just depends on the celebrity. They might get a quick 1 minute pic &amp; maybe an auto or they might get a lot of their time like with John Cena. \n\nI had a high school soccer player boy who was able to go to New York &amp; practice with the NY Red Bulls MLS team.  Jim Carrey used to do tons of wishes &amp; would often keep in touch after the wish. He finally stopped doing wishes after some of his wish kids died &amp; it took a toll emotionally for him. I don\u2019t remember how many he did, but it was a lot &amp; he was very gracious with the kids. \n\nIf anyone is interested in looking in to it just contact your local make a wish office. \n\nAlso if you set your Amazon to MAW smile they will get money from your purchases. It\u2019s really a great organization. It\u2019s almost as important (maybe more) for the parents, it gives them a break from hospitals &amp; worrying about their child\u2019s health issues &amp; outcomes. Also the happiness of the kids gives them some small moments of joy in a difficult time.",

A modern day super hero that we all should try to mirror ourselves after. If we all did 1/10th of what he does this world would be a much better place. I respect the hell out of this man and wish nothing but the best for him in the future.",

Big important distinction (that goes over a lot of heads, somehow).    \n    \nEdit to add: Tropic Thunder is also *very* deliberate in how they establish the character's motivation, too. He's a non-American douchey method actor. So the other important part of the joke is that his intentions are pure, but he's so absurd and oblivious as to how he'll be perceived. Meanwhile everyone else is rightly appalled.    \n   \nSo this works better than some of the other TV show examples where, \"it's ok because they learned their lesson\" or \"it's ok because they're a terrible person\". I'm not saying those other examples need to be \"cancelled\", but it's goes to show how good Ben Stiller is at understanding those nuances that his movie largely gets a pass.",

If anything a film built mostly by minorities that roasts the shit out of rich white people would be a bigger hit more now than then. I think the problem is that the film and it's writing style is very much of it's time. Films don't have that same kind of vibe to it anymore. Films from the early 00s are so distinct just like every era of film before then. I think the way films are approached nowadays is the main reason this film wouldn't probably be the same if it came out today.",

Cultural attitudes change and so does mainstream humour. Especially if that humour relies on stereotypes or other concepts that risk simply becoming dated in a few years. For whatever reason, the last few years a certain number of people has started to pretend that this constant cultural change is inconceivable.",

Just consider a sample of some of the projects he\u2019s worked on the last few years:\n\n-\t50 Shades of Gray, but with black people\n-\tSextuplets, which is effectively a Nutty Professor knock off\n-\tNaked, which is Groundhog\u2019s Day but with a guy who starts his loops naked\n-\tA Halloween movie where the decorations come to life and threaten a town\n\nSame tropes over and over. Literal copy-and-paste of concepts with minimal edits. The last big movie he was in was a GI Joe movie in 2009. The last movie he was featured in that I can recall getting any sort of promotion was Little Man in 2006, which was less successful at the box office that year than Tim Allen\u2019s Shaggy Dog. Similar box office to Little Miss Sunshine (around $100 million) but that movie was made for $8 million. Little Man had a $64 million price tag.\n\nI would like for good things to happen to Marlon because he seems like a good dude. But the concept of him not having been bankable since the 2000s is just straight up true. He quite literally hasn\u2019t had a hit since White Chicks.",

Also he says that he knows what the audience wants and everyone is secretly on his side but then like, why would executives be so iffy if that were the case. Seems like reality is slightly more complicated than \"go woke go broke\". Also it's perfectly fair for newer generations to be critical and lukewarm towards movies that rely heavily on mocking gender nonconformity for \"humor\". It's not just that some of us might be \"offended\" but like we straight up don't find it funny. \n\nWe have entered an era where anyone can deflect even the most milquetoast criticism with \"nooo I'm being cancelled!!!\"",

Bits get played out, trends in the genre come and go, references become obscure, situations become unrelatable[see every sitcom plot that could be solved by a cellphone].  Newsflash, the world changes.)\n\nNot everyone gets to be Mel Brooks, not every movie gets to be Holy Grail.  Sometimes the best you can hope for is maintaining your audience of a \u201ccertain age\u201d who still like your comedies for how they fit into the world at a given time.\n\nEnter cancel culture as a convenient boogie man to blame their increasing irrelevance to mainstream culture upon.",

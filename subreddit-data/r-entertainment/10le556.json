Apparently they used up their *entire allotment* of funny background text ideas on that one bookshelf, leaving no funny to spare on bulletin boards, school posters, business signs etcetera. I think I've been spoiled by shows like South Park to expect a higher *density* of funny than this.\n\n(the books on the bookshelf had these titles:\n\n* How To Solve Mysteries With Your Friends\n* SCUBA DO'S &amp; DON'TS\n* So You Can't Afford AUDIOBOOKS\n* The BIG Book of Books Seen In T.V. Shows\n* HISTORY OF FOG\n\n)",

Velma is not a nice person, like at all, and is probably one of the least likeable main characters of any show that I've seen. It also seems to have a very muddled message with regards to feminism and it just makes me wonder what happened to Mindy Kaling that she chose to create this show. \n\nThe show also made me uncomfortable several times because of the sexual comments or jokes made by adult characters to characters that are supposed to be *minors*. This show so far has an uncomfortable pattern of sexualizing high schoolers and I find that to be bizarre. \n\nAll of this is unfortunate because Mindy Kaling is not *wrong* about some of the things the show talks about, like unrealistic or restrictive beauty standards, but this show has a way of addressing it that is extremely cringey, preachy, and off-putting. Even though I agree with the core concept, I find it off-putting because it's not the way a real person would talk about it or address it and the types of people that would be so blunt about it are not generally nice people. \n\nI also think this show is very mean to the character Fred for no reason, but if we assume this show is about Mindy Kaling and Velma is Mindy, then I suspect Fred is a stand-in for every conventionally attractive white guy that Mindy Kaling pined over but who rejected her.",

You just watch the intro, and before you're even done wondering if it's ever going to have any other lyrics, you realize that they just couldn't make up their minds on the hands. They're four-finger cartoon-style hands, but they also have detailed nails and knuckle lines. Then the bizarre, inconsistent proportions and you have to wonder if they aren't *supposed* to be flawed imitations of humans.\n\nAnd that's before the episode even starts!",

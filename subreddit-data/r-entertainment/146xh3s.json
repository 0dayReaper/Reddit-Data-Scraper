            "comment": "I did sort of wonder why Joseph didn't \"break bigger\" after \"Shakespeare in Love.\"\n\nIt's interesting that Harvey offered him a 5 picture Miramax deal, and pressured him to sign it, saying it wouldn't be good for him if he didn't. \n\n\nSince Joseph was largely unknown in the U.S. and I don't believe even a big star like older brother Ralph in the U.K., and Miramax was huge and untouched by scandal at this point, an Oscar-accumulating machine, I can see this being a temptation. \n\nBut it sounds like Joseph didn't appreciate Harvey's \"negotiating tactics\" or want to be beholden to a studio  picture commitment and locked into that kind of contract so he passed. Good for him.",

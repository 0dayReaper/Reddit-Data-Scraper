            "comment": "How many directors get a $200 million dollar budget movie that flops as their first movie?\n\nLike M Night has had his share of flops but his first major movie was Wide Awake, it had a $6 million dollar budget and got mixed reviews. His next movie was Sixth Sense which had a $40 million budget and grossed over $670 million. He then had Signs &amp; Unbreakable. If he started with Lady in the Water which was critically panned and barely even made back its production budget I doubt he gets a second movie.\n\nChris Columbus directed Home Alone as his first major movie (two other smaller budget movies before), he also directed the sequel and Ms. Doubtfire before directing the flop of Bicentennial Man. \n\nThe only one I can think of is David Fincher who directed Alien 3. It was a bad movie and underperformed but still made 3x its production budget. His next movie was Seven which made 10x its production and was critically acclaimed then 2 films later Fight Club.",

Night keeps getting movies.\n\nHis new role in Hollywood is smaller budget horror movies $5-$20M max. Good or bad with his name on it even his worst movies gross $50-$100M meaning they bring in more than 2-3x their cost easily. If the studio gambles on enough of those marginally profitable movies though eventually they can get a \"Split\" from him. That was low budget thriller at $9M but was well received by audiences and made over $270M or more than 30x its production cost.\n\nIronically with M Night he actually makes better movies when he has budget constraints. It limits him from doing some of the crazy things that pop in his head.",

I think there are some directors who live and die on their reputations and Scott has a big one so that affords him the occasional Exodus and Kingdom of Heaven.\n\nBut for the bigger flops for up and coming directors that don't already have Oscar winning reputations, she's wrong.\n\nThe guy that directed The Lone Ranger for example...yeah, he's done out there. McG was given one big chance with Terminator Salvation before being relegated pretty much to TV shows and straight to Netflix movies. The guy that directed John Carter was allowed to co-direct Finding Dory before being relegated to TV.\n\nI think she's really ignoring people's reputations *before* they get their big budget flops.",

He has been always very vocal about race in his films (its not a coincidence the villian in Pans labyrinth is a \u201cpale man\u201d); i don\u2019t think he would disagree much with Longeria\n\n\u201cWe tried to make [The Shape of Water] as close to an indie movie as we could with a Mexican in the middle. For most people this thing started two years ago. If you\u2019re Mexican and cross the border it never went away; it depends on who you talk to. It\u2019s like cancer. We have a tumor, but it\u2019s not like it started with that tumor. I set it in 1962 because when people say \u2018make America great again\u2019 that\u2019s what they\u2019re thinking of. America was looking at the future, the space race; everything was great if you were white, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant. It\u2019s crystallized into a carrot that\u2019s carried around, it\u2019s a false memory\u2026\n\nThe ideas I wanted to put into the movie [was] the reversal\u2026was to make the guy who is usually the good guy in the \u201850s movies with the nice suit and the square jaw was make him the bad guy. So everybody who rescues the creature is invisible to the eyes of the white, Anglo-Saxon Protestant guy.\u201d",

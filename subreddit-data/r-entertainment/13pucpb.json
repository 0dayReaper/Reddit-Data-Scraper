The novel really expands the story and is what I see when I think of them. So it makes sense.\n\nAnd again Anakin killed the people that were having a tortured party with his mom and she knows Anakin saw what was happening to her. She is aware of his visions of his mom suffering.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have any sympathy for a group of people that would do that to a defenseless woman, kill nearly 30 of the people who tired to save her and they are the reason Owen\u2019s dad doesn\u2019t have a leg anymore.

Which is absurd given he seems to making HUGE assumptions about the location and time the movie is supposedly taking place.. mostly bc it is a fake land, with a fake kingdom, filled with fake species, magic, and all around just made up. I get the intention behind his post but it was wildly misplaced and odd. World history is only relevant when a story takes place in our world.. not a magic land with mermaids, sea witches, and choirs of animal sing underwater.",

This gives more weight to  Tritan's warnings to Ariel and increases the stakes of Ariel's desire to  be on land, Something like this could work, but it requires a real  talent in writing to pull it off AND I doubt Disney would ever  greenlight a subplot like this for a kids movie.",

I even chose to go watch the subbed version just to hear Halle Bailey's voice. All that to say I'm team Little Mermaid, however, yeah I can see where the original blogger is coming from and you can tell Disney also kinda was aware.\n\nI mean, right when the queen was introduced and it was explained that Eric is adopted, I initially thought \"how oddly specific\", but it only took me half a second to realize that a white British family as the ruling monarchy of a Caribbean island with mostly POC as \"servants\", \"peasants\" and merchants, set somewhere in the 18th century... was not good optics. And even with a black woman as queen, the fact that she was still British felt weird.\n\nI chose to ignore it and just enjoy the movie, but I did wonder how people from former British territories (and those with Afro-Caribbean heritage) will feel and I think it's only right they get to share their thoughts. I know for sure I wouldn't have found it cute if they had gone with a Latina actress and chose a Spanish Virrey as leading man. The fact that people can't see how that can be very offensive surprises me.\n\n**Edited** to say that unlike some unreasonable critics, this person recognized that it's silly to expect historically accurate content for kids and how heavy a topic racism is, they also offered viable alternatives *and* detailed why they felt the way they felt. I understand not agreeing with the blogger, but some of the comments here make it sound like it was a hateful post, [it wasn't.](https://blackonwhitetv.blogspot.com/2023/05/disneys-little-mermaid-caribbean.html)",

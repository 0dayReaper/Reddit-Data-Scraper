            "comment": "&gt;At the end of the spot, she reveals that the product is fake. \"Only real milk is real,\" Plaza said.\n\n&gt;The complaint cited a federal law that prohibits USDA-backed ads from disparaging other agricultural commodities. \n\nSeems like they have some chance of getting this charge to stick. I wonder if the courts or a jury will determine the disparagement of a *fictional* agricultural product, coupled with the phrase \"Only real milk is real\", runs afoul of the law.\n\n&gt;Another statute said that the ads couldn't influence government action or policy. Right now, the Food and Drug Administration is seeking public comments on proposed labeling guidelines for plant-based milk.\n\nThis is a way flimsier argument. There's no indication this ad was targeted at members of Congress or other law makers. The mere *existence* of the communication doesn't make it lobbying.",

In that commercial, she was the first actress (so she says, I don't know if it's verified) to name and disparage a competitor (McDonalds) in an ad. She said McDonald's burgers were smaller, so she went to BK. Something like that. \n\nMcDonalds sued her (or at least named her in the suit, it seems a bit hazy). That might be where the tides started to turn. \n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sarah-michelle-gellar-mcdonalds-lawsuit-burger-king-b2277600.html",

Maybe all this happens while they're frolicking in a meadow or some such. Then ends with a snappy \"Nut juice. Take the whole nut in your mouth.\"",

(Not advocating one way or another, that just tends to be the biggest argument)\n\nIf you are asking what the FDA is looking at regarding plant-based milk, it\u2019s just looking at the labeling. Almond milk is definitely not \u201cmilk\u201d in any traditional sense. Rather, it is a marketing term for soaking pulverized almonds in water to leech out the flavor and then filtering that out into a drinkable liquid. (In my opinion, if the FDA took an issue with this, the time to do something was 20 years ago when it first started getting broad acceptance in the public.)",

For one, that the market share of plant-based milk has increased over the last few years, while dairy milk is declining.  I didn't know it was sort of trending.  \n\nI drink almond milk, myself, and I changed over about eight years ago, because of gall stones, and I was trying to save my gall bladder.  I changed to almond milk to decrease my fat consumption, because fat would trigger a pancreatitis attack.  Whatever I used milk for, I used almond milke instead.  However, my efforts to keep my gallbladder were not successful, because I consumed other things that triggered these hours-long attacks, and over a period of about two years, I had something like seven attacks.  The gall bladder had to come out.\n\nHowever, during that time, my checkups showed that my cholesterol numbers had fallen.  Milk had been a staple food for me, and that my cholesterol levels improved was a nice surprise.  Since I had developed a taste for almond milk, I kept using it. \n\nAs for this article, the other thing I found interesting was that someone complained about it.   When I opened the article, because of the title, I assumed it was Aubrey just being Aubrey, and I knew she'd be able to pull off a satire like that.  How could anyone find fault?  When I read past the title--and some people here didn't--I was disappointed that it wasn't just satire, but an actual ad by the USDA.  I understand the complaint.  The USDA should not be a voice for the dairy industry.  Let the dairy industry make those ads.  \n\nLike they did with *Got Milk.*",

Soy milk, for example, has been produced in China for seven centuries or so, and the translation of \u8c46\u6f3f is literally \u201cbean milk.\u201d \n\nPlant-based milk products such as soy, almond, and rice milk have been commonly used in the West for nearly half a century, but it only became an issue for the dairy industry when plant-based milks reached a certain mainstream level, actually taking up an appreciable segment of the market. \n\nDairy is rightfully declining in popularity\u2014and, thus, profitability\u2014due to increased awareness of its negative environmental impact, ethical repercussions, and availability of healthy, good-tasting, sustainable alternatives. \n\nTrying to reframe this as dairy protecting itself from a wily competitor employing underhanded tactics for profit is ill-informed at best and disingenuous at worst. \n\nBy the way, the mayo case you\u2019re referring to was Unilever, make of Hellman\u2019s, suing Just Mayo for using the term \u201cmayo,\u201d claiming that eggs were a necessary ingredient in mayo and that this was misleading consumers. Unilever dropped the suit and Hellman\u2019s debuted a \u201cvegan dressing and spread\u201d shortly thereafter. I guess they at least didn\u2019t try and call it \u201cmayo!\u201d",

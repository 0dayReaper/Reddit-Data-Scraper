The effects are well done and the only things that seem anachronistic are things like computer monitors being CRT and not flat panels. Both Alien and The Thing relied heavily on practical effects and both were set in remote, isolated environments. The isolation helps the films seem classic because there isn't anything to really date them outside of technology. In The Thing we don't see old cars or outdated social conventions, just an Antarctic base. In Alien we're not seeing \"futuristic\" cities that usually end up looking dated pretty quickly. We only see a bunch of space truckers trying not to die. The isolation helps the timelessness. In terms of thematics, one could easily imagine Jeff Bezos ordering Ripley and the crew to investigate that signal.",

I do think he probably had turned by the scene with the noose which was why his demeanor had changed. He, as the thing, wanted to rejoin the group for more opportunities to infect the others.\n\nTo me, the scariest thing about the nature of the thing and the idea of being a perfect imitation is that you actually wouldn't know if you were yourself or an imitation. Essentially the thing could imitate everything about you like a perfectly simulated version of yourself, and it's not until it gets caught, cornered, needs to attack does it ever break out of the imitation.  Until that moment, your imitated self is allowed to live out normally... then at the flip of a switch you cease to be and become the monster. It's not like the thing is simply acting or pretending, it actually is existing *as you*, an identical facsimile.",

The tension and stress would remain. It would leave you engaged, with plenty more film to figure out what's going on.\n\nAnd then it just sort of ends with this huge question of whether MacReady or Childs might be infected. With no resolution. And that leaves you tense and stressed.\n\nAgain, The Thing, in the whole, is just a different level. And it never feels old. God damn I love The Thing.",

Since she doesn't really enjoy much fiction she got bored early on and instigated some Netflix and Chill^(TM). The Thing is great, but it's not romantic or sexy so we quickly turned it off. Our next date I re-rented it and the exact same thing happened.\n\nIt became a cute little private joke between us that we would never watch The Thing. I rented it on our second anniversary as a sexy joke. It's an adorable little bit of fun between us, but I'm slightly torn because we've been together more than a decade and I wouldn't mind *actually* watching it. First world problems, I know.",

But during production, the studio came in to inspect the work, and didn't like what they saw. See, practical effects like puppets don't look as good if you see them in person, because you see all the unfinished mechanical parts, like knobs and levers. Puppets like that are made very carefully so that the camera never sees the wrong parts, and small cgi adjustments are made to hide things when absolutely necessary. The studio execs saw the parts of the puppets that get hidden by camera work and then demanded all the effects be reshot with cgi, and the ending completely redone.",

Ghosts of Mars is insane but not campy. Maybe Big Trouble is camp, but it\u2019s still tries to be neo-traditional or whatever that style is. Very ambitious. \n\nAnd yes also the fact JC composed so many memorable scores is a very unique achievement. His music is the real deal synth wave no nostalgia act, but sometimes his scores are also like one note that just repeats. And that\u2019s amazing cuz he makes it work.\n\nCarpenter is wild. Sometimes he reminds me of a real life Garth Marenghi in the way he believes or at least buys into the fiction he creates. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPJMIctqFU",

(Saw, The Purge, (that movie where people are stuck in the boxes that move around))\n\nand \"Old-School Horror\" was more \"unbelievable monster\" scenario. (Friday 13th, Freddie Kruger, Jersey Girl, etc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCarpenters \"The Thing\" is definitely awesome because it is the movie that really is one of the first ones that stood on the bridge between the slasher monster flicks and the more modern Horror Thriller concepts.

It Follows, The Witch, Midsommer, Hereditary, etc.\n\nI think a better definition of horror is a movie in which the main purpose of the story is to scare people. Any definition of thrillers should be independent of that definition. I don't see a reason why they need to be mutually exclusive.",

It's rare for me to watch a movie more than once or twice*, I think I've watched get out around five times or so.. had to make a few friends watch it.\n\nI think a lot of people tend to write off movies out of the horror genre and call them thrillers simply because of a lack of either jump scares, slasher elements, or supernatural elements.  But the idea of a horror movie isn't necessarily to gross you out or to make you jump out of your seat, but to make you see a situation for what it is if you were in it : horrific.  \n\n\\* = There are exceptions.  I do rewatch certain movies to fall asleep to, usually older movies, stuff like dracula, the mummy, blade runner, Harry Potter, and TV shows like psych and Stargate.",

It is the top of my list of scariest horror films.  \n\nThat and the first Evil Dead freaked me the fuck out on first watch.  Now they\u2019re just guilty pleasures.\n\nThe close third is Event Horizon.\n\nFunny thing?  I usually don\u2019t react to supernatural horror.  Carpenter did Mouth of Madness as his final shot into horror and all I ever wanted was more.",

And (as he did here, in focusing on the iconic Carpenter), he shows that he\u2019s a class act. \n\nAnd to have moved to this from slapstick/sketch comedy?!?! You gotta respect this guy\u2019s talent!",

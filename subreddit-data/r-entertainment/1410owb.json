            "comment": "Japan\u2019s\u00a0Studio Ghibli\u00a0says it will release no trailer and no promotional materials whatsoever ahead of the release of\u00a0Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s final film\u00a0How Do You Live?\n\nThe forthcoming film, which opens in Japan on July 14, is easily the most anticipated movie coming to Japanese theaters in years \u2014 and exceedingly little is known about it (U.S. and\u00a0international\u00a0release dates for the film have not yet been set). Ghibli previously described the film as \u201ca grand fantasy\u201d loosely inspired by Japanese author Genzaburo Yoshino\u2019s 1937 novel\u00a0How Do You Live?, a coming-of-age story about the emotional and philosophical development of a young boy after the death of his father. And the studio released one, obscure poster for the film in December (see it below), but it has said nothing else about the movie since \u2014\u00a0no plot summary, no voice cast, nothing about the film\u2019s setting or characters. In an interview with Japanese magazine Bungei Shunji\u00a0on Friday, Ghibli\u2019s longtime lead producer Toshio Suzuki, considered Miyazaki\u2019s righthand man, said nothing more will be revealed about the film before it hits theaters.\n\nExplaining the absence of marking for the upcoming movie, which has already become conspicuous in Japan, Suzuki said:\u00a0\u201cAs part of company operations, over the years Ghibli has wanted people to come see the movies we\u2019ve made. So we\u2019ve thought about that and done a lot of different things for that purpose \u2014 but this time we were like,\u00a0\u2018Eh, we don\u2019t need to do that.'\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cDoing the same thing you\u2019ve done before, over and over, you get tired of it. So we wanted to do something different.\u201d\n\nFans of the legendary anime house, which has long prioritized a pure experience of its works over commercial considerations, will recognize the decision as a very Studio Ghibli-esque move. For years, Ghibli restricted the amount of merchandise that could be licensed and made from its characters, for fear that they might become over-exposed and lose some of their magic. And when the company launched its first long-gestating theme park last year, it limited advanced media access to the park, worried that widespread coverage would make the attraction too popular, which would undercut the gentle appreciation of nature it was designed to generate for visitors.\n\nIn the interview, Suzuki also contrasted Ghibli\u2019s approach for\u00a0How Do You Live?\u00a0with the usual marketing methods of Hollywood.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an American movie \u2014 ah, I almost said the title out loud! \u2014 coming out this summer around the same time [as\u00a0How Do You Live?],\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve made three trailers for it, and released them one at a time. If you watch all three, you know everything that\u2019s going to happen in that movie. So how do moviegoers feel about that? There must be people, who, after watching all the trailers, don\u2019t want to actually go see the movie. So, I wanted to do the opposite of that.\u201d\n\nSuzuki also revealed that it was a compliment from Miyazaki about the first poster that ultimately convinced him to go with such a bold, barebones approach to releasing the movie.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI\u2019ve been involved with our movies since\u00a0Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\u00a0(1984), but this was the first time Hayao Miyazaki genuinely praised me. \u2018Suzuki-san, this is amazing. This is the best poster you\u2019ve ever made,\u2019 he said. I felt like that was a hint, so I decided \u2018Let\u2019s go with just this one poster for the marketing.\u2019 So, no trailers or TV commercials at all\u2026 No newspaper ads either.\u00a0Deep down, I think this is what moviegoers latently desire.\u201d",

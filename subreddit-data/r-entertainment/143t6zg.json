That was in 2010 and I\u2019ve been unable to seek therapy since even during the suicidal times. \n\nHonestly what truly helped me and makes me talk about it so brazenly hoping other male victims will see it- was my wife. Not long after we got engaged I just had a breakdown and told her everything. I felt like I couldn\u2019t marry her unless she knew. It was the first time since 2010 that is ever said it out loud. This was in 2018. \n\nNow I bring it up every chance I get because the amount of men just like me holding on, I want them to see it. I want them to see it\u2019s not just them. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a horrible stigma. My own sister- who was abused by the same person, told me it wasn\u2019t the same for me. She still holds that belief to this day. \n\nLadies like you who don\u2019t attack immediately are such wonderful creatures. We appreciate you, and your empathy.

In so many ways, of course it\u2019s worse for men. \nOn the other hand, when I was raped I was also impregnated by my rapist. It was my first pregnancy and added insult to injury. When I reported, the cops asked what I was wearing, if I were inebriated, if I \u201cliked\u201d my rapist. All those tropes. \nSighhhh. It\u2019s not a contest anyone needs to win, right?

I really don\u2019t see any producer wanting a \u201cfuckable\u201d actress for that role, considering most of the audience will probably be dads and families looking to connect with the characters on the screen.\n\nI also scoured the internet and couldn\u2019t find the father-daughter road trip comedy she\u2019s talking about. No film matches the timeline from when Fanning would\u2019ve been 16 (2014-2015 + 1-2 years). The only film that remotely matches her description is a French film and Fanning doesn\u2019t speak any other languages than English.\n\nIt seems the film was never made?\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that, in 2014, Fanning worked on 5 films, including Maleficent, so she was obv a respected and very in-demand actress at this point.",

Unfortunate it seems to be worse then I even thought.\n\n\u201cClose in age exceptions\nA 14 or 15 year old can consent to sexual activity as long as the partner is less than five years older and there is no relationship of trust, authority or dependency or any other exploitation of the young person. This means that if the partner is 5 years or older than the 14 or 15 year old, any sexual activity is a criminal offence.\u201d\n\nIf I am reading the right, an 18 year old can have sexual relations with a 14 year old and it can be ok.\n\nOof.\n\nEdit: not sure why this is being downvoted and my comment two below is being upvotes. Is it that I didn\u2019t explain why I find the law not ok?",

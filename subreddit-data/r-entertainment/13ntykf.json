That was my high school soundtrack.\n\nSo when they announced Wayne was on the line up for the return of Jazz Fest after Katrina in \u201806 I was so excited to see him. After all the city had been through, I for sure thought he was going to fucking bring it. When it was time for his performance, he came out and put on one of the most embarrassing live performances I had ever seen. He was so drugged out, it was obvious to every single person in the crowd. At one point in the show he was just kind of rolling around on the stage horribly attempting to play guitar. It was probably one of the most disappointing live performances I had ever been to in my life. (Still to this day) Later that night, Bruce Springsteen closed out Jazz Fest. Barely played any original songs. Brought out multiple New Orleans loved local acts, and just jammed with them. Wound up closing with the most soulful rendition of \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In\u201d that had everyone in the crowd bawling at the end of the set. \n\nWayne\u2019s a great studio musician. Legendary even. But I wouldn\u2019t waste my time going see him live if the show was free. At something that could have been the most inspirational performance he could have given back to the city he\u2019s from, a city that was hurting and loves him so much, he chose to be a drugged up mess. I still fuck with  his music, but he needs to keep his ass in the studio.",

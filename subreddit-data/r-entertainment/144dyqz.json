            "comment": "&gt; Ryan's mysterious source \"Emma\" recalls being told **Lucasfilm didn't particularly care about going over-budget. Emma initially found that difficult to believe, \"but I saw it up close - that it doesn't matter how many mistakes are made or how incompetent some people are. Our budget doubled, and I'm sure it went up after I left. I've never seen anything like it.\"** Ryan is, again, careful to note this is just one person's opinion. Still, she points to Lucasfilm's confidence in Star Wars, and Emma herself notes the success of The Mandalorian reinforced an internal corporate belief the company can do no wrong. \"Your overconfidence is your weakness,\" Luke Skywalker told the Emperor in Return of the Jedi, and that appears to be the case with Lucasfilm.\n\nYeah, we can see that. Also, spending $300 million on 'Indy 5' is insane.",

Given its huge budget, and using the 2.5x rule, \u2018Fast X\u2019 breakeven is around $850 million.\n\nSo far, the movie has grossed $617 million worldwide. The studio only gets 50% of the domestic market and between 25% - 40% from overseas market. \n\n&gt; Disney+ and Mando merch makes 100s of millions a year\n\nDisney+ is not profitable yet, that's why Disney has been removing content from the service. Also, Mando merchandise profit is not relevant to 'Indy 5' box office.",

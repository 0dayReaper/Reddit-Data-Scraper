It leaves room for more, but it doesn't leave too many threads unanswered/incomplete.   \n\n\nThis movie leaves A LOT of the story incomplete and if you were to say this was the final movie, you'd be pretty disappointed it didn't finish the story.  \n\n\nHonestly, they should have kept the \"part 1\" in the advertising material because now you have a 2h 20m movie that just \"ends\" without any real resolution to the story it was telling.   \n\n\nWith all that being said. I like this movie more than the first and it had a better mesh of art styles. And I cannot wait for the next movie.",

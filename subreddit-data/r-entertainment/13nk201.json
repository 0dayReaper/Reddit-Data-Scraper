            "comment": "The original Roseanne was a wonderful portrayal of the average working family.  Many of the viewers could relate to the characters and struggles.  The reboot, I think did a fine job of revisiting these characters.  However, it was missing something...  And it was that Roseanne's character seemed different.  Everyone else was the same.  The show became more like it was after she was no longer a part of it.  \nAnd I really like the story where she is killed off.  Opioid crisis stuff.  And John Goodman killed his scenes.",

We were poor, on food stamps, and just couldn't relate to other tv families that, though portrayed as \"middle class\", seemed RICH to us.",

Trying to \u2018decide\u2019 where to go to college, \u2018very special episodes\u2019 where they go to Hawaii, etc. But Roseanne  made sense. When Dan had to close his bike shop, I cried hard for him. \nWhat\u2019s happened with the reboot almost makes sense jn a way. Just like Roseanne herself, there are people I\u2019ve had to say goodbye to over this shit. And it breaks my heart.",

The man can act his tush off - you\u2019re right - he\u2019s so much better than Roseanne, but that\u2019s where I first saw him and fell in love with him, so I\u2019ve got a soft spot for it.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t list all his roles here\ud83d\ude02 I love the passion y\u2019all are bringing to the John Goodman fan club tho.

Roseanne actually threatened to quit if she could put jokes in the show making fun of Hillary Clinton and other democrats. This just made the show feel so different and your opinion of normalcy was just less political stuff.\n\nEdit: keep in mind people like the person below are defending the person with this personality. Also the examples are things like abortion in the show. That\u2019s not politics it\u2019s healthcare, what\u2019s next you going to get a broken arm fixed should be debated in congress. Mentioning literal politics like one political party sucks is political discussion. Talking about a woman right to choose isn\u2019t political discussion and never will be. Just because MAGA tries to make that about politics doesn\u2019t mean it is. Also I see I hurt his feelings by pointing these things out. They are easily triggered from what it appears like. I wonder if they know I haven\u2019t been reading anything they add, I just noticed it was longer and it made him loose it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Io6OIcPZ-z0",

Her parents and grandparents were in the business, her siblings were also successful child actors; she has always known how the whole thing works. Like every other business, show business is about relationships and mutual success.\n\nRoseanne does not have mutual successes. She does not build relationships. It has always been her way or the highway, and even on the original show she would fire really talented people on a dime, over imagined personal slights. Her tantrums were common, not just on set but in restaurants and industry events. \n\nRoseanne has always been unpredictable and wildly destructive. Over the years she\u2019s blamed her well-documented terrible behavior on childhood abuse, mental illness, other people\u2019s grudges against her, etc., but the bottom line is always the same: nothing is her fault. She\u2019s hated for no reason. The world is out to get her. \n\nThe truth? NO ONE CARES about Roseanne except Roseanne. She is the problem, and she\u2019s done so little work to build common cause with others that she is now an easy problem to remove. \n\nSara Gilbert said what she said not just because it was true, but because she could see where the problem in production was. She was right. Every room Roseanne has ever been in is better the instant she leaves it. Everyone in her life (including her own children and grandchildren) knows this. \n\nI invite you all to ask around. You\u2019ll hear a hundred stories about how true this is.",

They realized with the reboot that she didn\u2019t change and mellow out with age (got worse even) and they couldn\u2019t hide her behavior in modern day information age. She totally had to go, but the drug OD was a brilliant way to write off her character because that is exactly what\u2019s happening to working class midwestern families. And it happens sudden and family dynamics have to change fast to survive. They already started the pain pill addiction plot line before they had to cut her, and a sudden death of the character made a lot of sense and added some realistic dimension to the show.",

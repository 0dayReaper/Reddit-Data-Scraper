Difference, though, Sajak hosted his show for 42 years (dating back to the NBC daytime version), while Barker hosted TPIR for 35.\n\nSajak is the last of those \"old-school\" game show hosts that's still hosting a show; Bob Eubanks and original Wheel host Chuck Woolery are still alive, but they haven't hosted a TV show since the mid-2000s, while all of the other well-known have since left this Earth.",

Sajak just happened to work at the same studio (the old NBC Burbank Studios) where Wheel was taping at the time.  Pat was a weathercaster for KNBC-TV before landing the Wheel gig.\n\nWoolery also had a pilot for a daytime talk show at the same time he and Griffin were negotiating, but obviously the show didn't sell, and Chuck ended up hosting Love Connection (1983-92) and Scrabble (1984-90, '93) not long after though.",

A job hiring someone based solely on the fact that they're a minority isn't racism, it's trying to even the playing field and level out against the companies who wouldn't hire them because they're a minority... Like the example in this post where there was one woman out of 63 people on set.\n\nAlso, diversity is good and healthy for the workplace. I work security at a casino and, despite the revolving door of managers, they have not hired a female manager until recently. That is a problem. It's fostered an environment where most people do not treat women with respect and it makes the new boss' job much more difficult than it should be.",

Nice visible example. \n\nThere are 2 main parties. \n\nThe progressive one has used diversity based shortlisting to ensure women and ethnic minority candidates are the only people able to get elected to some roles. Believe the courts have just banned this practice.\n\nThe right wingers did not do this, but encouraged diverse candidates to apply and have everyone get chosen using the same system. Which is meant to be fairly unpleasant.\n\nThe right wingers have currently had 3 female leaders, the first ethnic minority Prime minister, along with a set of ministers that is not unrepresentative of the UK population makeup (by essential characteristics only, their views are not). They're a shit party, but that's beside the point. You also get a load of racists claiming they're not real ethnic minorities as they are right wing, but takes all sorts.\n\nThe more progressive party has only been led by white men, and their cabinets have been overwhelmingly white. I believe a lot of people, particularly their party members, hold an unfair view that their more diverse candidates are not as high quality and got 'given' their job, so are not appealing as the leaders of the party. I have never seen anyone admit this, but they do seem to keep voting that way.\n\nSure there's something in there somewhere.",

                    "comment": "I remember reading a story of one black football coach who was asked in for an interview for a head coaching job. He spent days doing his research on the team. He wanted to be fully prepared for any questions the GM &amp; ownership would have about his coaching philosophy and how that would interact with the players.\n\nSo, he goes to the team office, and waits to meet the GM &amp; ownership. The owner and the GM arrive over an hour late, and they're clearly hungover from a big party they had recently. They look all disheveled, and don't seem to care that they had a (supposedly important) interview to do today. The questions the GM and the owner ask to the coach are only surface-level (at best). The coach realizes he's only there to check off the \"team must interview black coach\" box on the NFL's Rooney Rule, and that the GM and ownership had no actual interest in hiring him at all.\n\nBut, the thing is, interviewing a person for an important job in sports (like a head coach or a GM) is a two-way street. The person being interviewed wants to be prepared, and you hope the people doing the interview do some research on the candidate being interviewed, too.\n\nSo, when you see a big-league team (be it MLB or NHL or NFL or NBA) fire its head coach or GM, the people in charge of hiring the new guy will put together a list of \"interview candidates\" for who they want to take over next (which is why you'll usually see the sports reporters on twitter talking about the \"favourites\" to take over next).\n\nBut, maybe a darkhorse candidate gives a really impressive interview, and the people doing the hiring are like \"Wow, we actually really like this guy, he just blew us away with all his knowledge\", and they end up hiring the darkhorse. But that also requires the people doing the interview to be prepared on their end as well. \n\nIf ownership shows up to the inteview with the black coaching candidate saying \"We have to interview the black coaching candidate just for the sake of checking off the box of interviewing the black coaching candidate\" and actually has no interest in doing the interview at all, they're not actually giving the black coaching candidate a chance to impress them at all, are they?\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sham-interviews-mistaken-bill-belichick-texts-6-takeaways-brian-flores-rcna14605",

A concept from feminism, a movement originated by rich women, on \u201cbehalf\u201d of all women. \n\nKind of like how a bunch of rich men rebelled against an even richer guy, and got poor men to do the fighting for them in the name of the American Revolution.\n\nAmerican revolutions are all rich people revolutions, against other rich people. America has never had its class revolution and that\u2019s why it a dump now. Just performative bs but nothing changes",

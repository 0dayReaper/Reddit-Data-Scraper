America has millions of brown and black people, the only way to keep them out of movies would be to deny them roles based on their race. So, I don't think every single brown or black person is in Hollywood due to woke diversity quotas.\n\nThe Little Mermaid and some other movies are different because the forced diversity is in full display, and also because Disney keeps replacing white people with black people, thus making it obviously about race.",

In China, The Little Mermaid brought in just $2.5 million through Sunday, and a slightly higher $4 million in Brazil and Australia.\n\n&gt;Its performance in Mexico fared significantly better, raking in $8.5 million across its opening weekend. It also scored $6.3 million at the UK box office and $4.7 million in Italy.\n\nThis movie is doing worse than Black Adam did internationally and there are speculations it might not even break even.",

Lowest top 5 market was South Korea with 10.1m, France was 9.7m, China was 27.6m, what are you even talking about? It had 170m OS opening, so even without China it was more than double of TLM opening. TLM currently has worst overseas opening among all modern disney live-action adaptations. It is ahead of Aladdin in only one market - France where Aladdin had awful start. And Aladding got over 300m just from Asia. Movie is on course to lose money, unless dynamics domestically change (it didn't have expected walk ups and had really low increase from friday to saturday combined with harsher satsun drop) and it doesn't explode after release in Japan. Movie currently competing with Dumbo and Maleficent in all overseas markets except UK, Australia and France where it still is comparable to Aladdin.",

One main difference I find is that Americans are actually willing to have a conversation about race, because of the history of their country. \n\nIn many European countries, native Europeans will insist racism isn't an issue while treating Turkish and West Africans like shit. Hell, even in Latin American countries, which are also incredibly diverse, there is an insistence that everyone is the same (we are all Brazilians) while some people are clearly treat better (Euro-Brazilians) and others are treated worse (Afro-Brazilians).",

It\u2019ll probably end somewhere between $500M-$600M worldwide, which is dangerously close to the breakeven line at a $250M budget and $150M marketing (studios only receive a percentage of revenues back since theaters also take a cut \u2014 the studio\u2019s take ranges from 50-60% domestically to 40% internationally and 25% in China).\n\nThe international opening was really bad, no way around that one. For reference, Black Adam opened bigger overseas ($76M international opening versus $68M for TLM). This movie is heavily dependent on its domestic performance. If TLM makes ~$300M in the U.S. (the high end of projections after its opening) and makes the same internationally as Black Adam, that would be a worldwide total of just about $525M. That would probably mean a theatrical loss for Disney.\n\nAladdin opened to $123M overseas.",

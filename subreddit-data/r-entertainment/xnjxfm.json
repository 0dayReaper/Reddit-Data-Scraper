Also, it's like he has this need to be at least adjacent to powerful people. Influence and fame are his motivations for everything he says. He has to keep saying more and more outrageous things to keep the attention on himself.\n\nMaybe at some point in his life he actually cared about furthering conservative causes because he legitimately believed in them. Or, maybe, he's always been an unprincipled, power-hungry charlatan who failed upward to get where he is today.",

The best I can describe it as is when you go to the pound and look at dogs, and there's sometimes that really skittish dog that is pinned to the back of the kennel shaking in fear. It made me wonder if he is like that with all members of the public. Then he went on stage and it was like a totally different person. So weird.",

Apparently a lot of dialogue is improv, which gives many of the conversations a more natural flow.\n\nBest of all, you get to watch a bunch of rich assholes suffer.",

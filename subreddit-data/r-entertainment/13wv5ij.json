That amount will grow by nearly $3 billion if Microsoft has to pay Activision the deal breakup fee negotiated as part of the transaction. That\u2019s a lot of cash to wield, should Kotick decide to go shopping for other companies",

I loved Blizzard games growing up, but as time went on I was not so impressed with their offering. So I moved on. I don't go around calling people \"human garbage\" just because they steered a franchise in a direction I don't like. And I let accusations be settled via established institutions such as judicial courts.",

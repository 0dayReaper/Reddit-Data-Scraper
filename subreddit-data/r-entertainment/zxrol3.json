I knew that any signs of weakness would establish me in his eyes as easy prey. \"You've been looking at that cap in the mirror for almost 15 hours. It's the middle of the night, and my family must be worried.\"\n\nJake's eyes narrowed, scanning the otherwise empty building for a moment before connecting with mine. I struggled to suppress a shudder. This was the first time since he'd entered the store this morning that we had made eye contact at all. He had stalked directly towards the mirror, pulled the cap out of his own coat pocket, and firmly adjusted it onto his head.\n\nAfter that...nothing. Just 15 hours of staring at his hat in the mirror, his face full of grim purpose. I briefly wondered why he couldn't just do, well, *whatever this was* at home since he evidently didn't need our merchandise. Something told me it would be a very foolish idea to ask him that.\n\nJake shifted slightly, jerking me out of my ruminations. Now unable to control my obvious trembling, I forced my eyes up to meet his gaze again.\n\nOnce he was sure he had my full attention, Jake altered his expression for the first time all day to give me a subtle smirk. God, why had I agreed to cover Megan's shift today?  I blinked rapidly, feeling the sting of tears threatening to escape my eyes. In that moment, I realized once and for all that I would never see my family again.\n\nThe End :)",

I was a big fan in the early years, but lost interest a few years back. regardless, it\u2019s incredibly sad to watch anyone completely lose control of their life and become completely consumed by their untreated mental illness - and for it to happen so publicly? yikes. it\u2019s awful. at the end of the day, I would love to see him get healthy and find some peace. I just don\u2019t think that can be done while maintaining any sort of public persona. he realistically needs to fully pull back from the public sphere and stay out. the attention he gets just seems to compound the issue and make it harder for him to find reality.",

I can\u2019t speak for the effects of fame and insular social groups on the mind either though.\n\nIdk, I have sympathy but at the same time Kanye had ample opportunities to do better and he skipped all of them. I don\u2019t wish him ill though, I just wish he\u2019d stop hurting himself and other people.\n\nShits disappointing",

Your entire personality manifests itself in a different way as a result of your brain chemistry. Your behavior becomes something that you can\u2019t exactly control, as hard as that is for a non-bipolar person to imagine. Mania often requires hospitalization and one can easily experience psychosis.\n\nI\u2019m not defending Kanye. His ideas are terrible. In fact I lament the idea that he is probably the most well-known bipolar person, because it gives the layperson a very warped idea of this actually very debilitating illness.\n\nThe depressive episodes suck, yes. But the manic episodes are what truly destroy your life, reputation, relationships, financial security, and your sense of identity.\n\nSorry about the long-winded comment. If at least one person reads this and has a better understanding and empathy for those with this illness, it\u2019ll have been worth it.",

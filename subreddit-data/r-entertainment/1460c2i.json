            "comment": " It\u2019s sad that David Byrne was on the side of producing a Broadway show with prerecorded music and no musicians.  \n\nThe reason why this is an issue is because Producers all over Broadway have been scheming to save money by eliminating the live orchestra in all of the shows. \n\nImagine being the tourist who pays hundreds for tickets that are performed by actors lip syncing to canned music, and then being asked to shell out more for the soundtrack.\n\nEdit:\n\nI picked this article because it presents both sides (sort of). I am pro union. \n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2023/06/03/1179684527/broadway-big-orchestras-returning-theater-sweeney-todd-josh-groban",

There is no longer a proscenium stage,\u201d he wrote in part.\u201d\n\nSeems like Byrne had made a creative decision and not a financial one.

I don't remember specifics, but I do know that at one point he made Tina Weymouth (a founding member of Talking Heads!) *audition* to get her old job back. Weymouth was a big, influential part of the band's sound, all the way back to the beginning.\n\nThere's more stories. He's not the worst person in the world, but he sounds like a difficult person overall. A musical genius (at least from 1975-1990 or so, and a few exceptions after that... American Utopia show is pretty great), but kind of a jerk.\n\nNot an excuse, but he may be on the spectrum of autism. I think he's talked about that himself. He's from a generation where that wasn't diagnosed or discussed much.",

He wants a solo tour where he doesn\u2019t have to travel anywhere or pay musician salaries. \n\nI understand that it\u2019s basically EDM but a clever arranger and competent musicians can emulate or enhance this music. Many pit musicians are already doublers on multiple instruments. Many are tech savvy. The truth is that he wants complete creative control, and doesn\u2019t have the skills to arrange for a pit orchestra with integrated electronics. He doesn\u2019t want to admit it, or hire someone that might take the ball out of his court.",

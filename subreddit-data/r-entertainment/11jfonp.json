It's a seamless mix of Western and gangster genres. It is a retelling of Akira kurosawa's Yojimbo. Willis as the nameless samurai with his invincible weapons, his twin .45 1911s that each hold somewhere around 20 to 30 shots each. (People love pointing this out as a glaring movie mistake but it's part of the point of the story.) Oh, and of course, we see Bruce Willis naked. He's naked in SO MANY of his movies....\n\nBut I digress. See Last Man Standing. It's good",

It's Bruce Willis as he was always meant to be seen, fighting against like 40 guys at once. The cinematography is great considering how brown and dusty every scene is, seriously, watching the movie will make your mouth dry /a\n\nIt has Bruce Dern and Christopher Walken.\n\nNot hard to see why it was overlooked, it was up against The Rock, the Nutty Professor... And Independence day was still in theaters I think.",

(With an earnest Borgnine cameo no less...)\n\nSuper fun popcorn flick! Bruce Willis still kicking ass into his '60s And that fight scene at Langley was fucking dope! Karl Urban doesn't get enough credit either.\n\nBtw, DieHard is a trilogy. Die hard, Die hard with a vengeance, and live free or die hard. That's the trilogy. With A Vengeance IMHO, just barely edges out die hard for the best in the series. John McLain in his native element! And I really liked Live Free Or Die Hard, Timothy Oliphant makes a good villain even if he is nearly cartoonishly OPed. Kevin Smith had a hand in some of the writing and a cameo (which he talks at length about in one of his evening with Kevin Smith DVDs, check them out, they're also great if you like Kevin Smith) and the wacky buddy dynamic between McLain and Justin Long, I think, works . It's a popcorn summer thrill ride",

I always sucked at reading so even in grade school my mom would check out cassette tapes of narrated books for me at the library. I\u2019d read my summer books by following along the text while listening to cassettes. I didn\u2019t even have internet back then but still had no attention span. Books on tape have been a theme for me for the last 20 years and now they are really convenient with all the apps and online library stuff.",

It seemed like a teenage adventure movie. \n\nBut never did I think it was Tom Hollands acting that was the problem. I love him and thought he did a great job! \n\nThe lines weren\u2019t great, storyline kind of lame, the humor didn\u2019t humor me (why I thought maybe I\u2019m just old for it), and most of all the supporting actors were very one dimensional. \n\nThe whole movie is Wahlberg saying \u201cyou gotta trust me kid\u201d with his eyebrows raised and forehead scrunched. I think they could have gone with someone better suited for Wahlbergs role.",

Communities can't police itself when it comes to people sending disgusting DMs to people.

Maybe give people the option to add filter words themselves.

            "comment": "Rebel Wilson\u00a0is getting behind the camera and has lined up her first feature as director.\n\nThe Deb, in which Wilson will also co-star, will be a musical comedy set in rural Australia, produced by Amanda Ghost,\u00a0Len Blavatnik, and Gregor Cameron via their company Unigram\u00a0(Tetris)\u00a0and sister company AI Film (I, Tonya, Hacksaw Ridge).\n\nAdapted from of the original hit musical of the same name \u2014 which debuted to critical acclaim in Australia \u2014\u00a0The Deb\u00a0will be produced in partnership with Rebel Wilson\u2019s Camp Sugar Productions (Senior Year, The Hustle)\u00a0and award-winning Australian producer Bunya Productions (The Drover\u2019s Wife, Mystery Road). Danny Cohen executive produces on behalf of Blavatnik\u2019s Access Entertainment.\n\nOriginally premiering at Sydney\u2019s Australian Theatre for Young People (ATYP) in 2022,\u00a0The Deb\u00a0stage production was written by Hannah Reilly (Sheilas, Growing up Gracefully) and includes original songs from singer-songwriter Meg Washington (The Beach). Production is set to begin in Australia in September.\n\nThe Deb\u00a0follows lovable farm girl and high school outcast Taylah Simpkins (Natalie Abbott), who is certain the upcoming Debutante Ball, \u201cthe Deb,\u201d is her one chance to redefine herself. When her cynical city cousin Maeve (Charlotte MacInnes) is exiled to Taylah\u2019s drought-stricken town Dunburn, she thinks the ball is a \u201cheteronormative shit-show\u201d and immediately disrupts the status quo. In their search for the spotlight, Taylah and Maeve dig deep to find self-acceptance \u2014 and a date to the Deb.\n\nThe adaptation will feature a cast of rising Australian stars, including MacInnes (who had an award-nominated performance in ATYP\u2019s\u00a0The Deb), award-nominated Natalie Abbott (Aftertaste, A Perfect Pairing,\u00a0Global Creature\u2019s Muriel\u2019s Wedding the Musical) and Stevie Jean (2022 winner of NT Music Award for Rock Song of the Year).\n\nPopular local talent will also include Tara Morice (Strictly Ballroom, Moulin Rouge, Dance Academy), Jay Laga\u2019aia (Nim\u2019s Island, Star Wars, The Lion King, Wicked), Shane Jacobson (Kenny, The Bourne Legacy, The Dressmaker, Hairspray) and Wilson (Pitch Perfect trilogy, Bridesmaids, Isn\u2019t It Romantic).\u00a0\n\nThe musical production was an instant hit in Australia, with critics hailing it \u201ca love letter to\u2026 learning how to celebrate what makes you unique,\u201d and lauding the script for celebrating \u201ca new joyful onstage movement of women-centered, lovingly local stories with big laughs and big pop choruses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Deb\u00a0is my type of movie \u2014 full of humor, full of heart, and uniquely Australian but with universal themes. It came out of my scholarship program at the non-profit Australian Theatre for Young People, a program that I\u2019m very proud of and has had incredible success. If there was ever a movie I was going to direct, it would be this one,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cThis project is just so special and original. Hannah and Meg have done an outstanding job writing it, and to collaborate with Amanda, Len, Gregor, and the team at Bunya down under has been amazing. We\u2019re utilizing the best musical resources in the world and the most fantastic Australian talent to bring this project to the screen.\u201d\n\nAdded Wilson: \u201cI grew up watching Australian classics like\u00a0Muriel\u2019s Wedding, The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert,\u00a0and Baz Luhrmann\u2019s early films. My goal is to create an Australian work that rivals those masterpieces and travels internationally. I know I can bring the funny, and hopefully it\u2019ll be just as moving as well.\u201d",

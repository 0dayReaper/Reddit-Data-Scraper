See how they retracted it here: [\"OOPS: Fox host admits the entire story was made up.\u201d](https://youtu.be/tP5XpT8hsWQ)",

                    "comment": "This reminds me of how, during the first government shutdown of the Obama administration, Fox News reported that Obama used his personal money to pay to keep an Islamic museum open during the shutdown. The implication of course being that Obama was a closeted Muslim who was trying to subvert 'Murica from within.\n\nBut of course the story was a total fabrication. There are ZERO federally funded Islamic museums in the U.S. And even if there were, Obama wouldn't have been dumb enough to pay out of his own pocket to keep them open.\n\nFox's \"retraction\" of the made-up story consisted of the anchor who reported it tweeting she made a mistake in her reporting the day before *without even mentioning the story she was referring to*. The tone of the tweet was \"Ooopsie! Things happen. LOL!\"\n\nNo retraction was issued on air.\n\nFox News is, and always has been, complete garbage.",

I believe he knows enough to *uphold the Constitution.* But sadly, some others *who should know better* (Ted Cruz and Ron DeSantis, to start) can no longer be trusted to preserve, protect, and defend it. Trump has already started an insurrection and stole state secrets, while his daughter and son-in-law mysteriously received $2 Billion from Saudi Arabia. We must get to the bottom of this, with or without FOX.",

But that doesn\u2019t mean that the news shouldn\u2019t report on it. It is surprising to me that Fox brought this issue up at all though given their target audience.

The GOP needs to quit with the culture war stuff and actually put legit candidates with substantial policies up if they want a chance at winning over moderates and independents.",

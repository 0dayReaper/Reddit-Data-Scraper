Because while a black Ariel is different from the original, parents are only going to buy one or the other, so it's only adding a percentage of existing sales to those parents who would buy the new Ariel but would never buy the old one. \n\nSame with streaming rights. Again you have to convince people that having both versions of the movie is much more profitable than just having the original, which internationally looks to be a hard sell given how its flopping. And domestically I assume every parent already have D+ so what are you really adding here?\n\nI do get that Disney movies are more than just about the box office, but when you are a remake of an already insanely popular IP,",

In this case 250 million x 2.5 = 625 million dollar.\n\nWe normally didn't include marketing budget but this movie marketing budget is really high (80 million). That's why there are some who might think TLM break is actually 700mil + like Fast X.\n\nEdit - marketing budget is actually 140 million.",

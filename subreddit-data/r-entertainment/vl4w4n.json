Eve couldn't know that disobeying and eating from the tree was bad without eating from the tree. Then, anyone exerting their free will was destroyed by god(flood, Sodom and Gomorrah, wars, etc), but anyone following god's instructions by blind faith without questioning whether killing people in war or sacrifices or anything else was rewarded. Then Jesus came along and is literally called a shepard. Christians are taught to be sheep and not make any decisions of their own, only relying on \"what God calls them to do.\" They take away everyone's freedoms including their own because they sincerely believe that freedom is sin. Free will is the ability to choose between doing something good, bad, or in between. If learning the difference between good and evil was original sin, then sin and free will are one and the same. Once you look at Christianity through the lense of \"Sin=Free Will\" everything gets very clear. People are full of sin no matter what they do, but if they repent and strive every day to only do exactly what god says to do, they will be less sinful. Meaning, \"give up your free will, and I'll accept you.\" Christianity is literally a slave religion. Those who are free will be punished, and those who obey without question will be rewarded. The Bible doesn't condemn slavery, because that would be a direct conflict with its message of godly servitude and obedience.",

The woman has to drink this cursed water and if she miscarries it proves she's a cheating slut? The forced miscarriage is her punishment, she \"will become a curse.\" Is that really the same as \"allowing abortion?\" Is that really advocating for a woman's reproductive rights? \n\nCome on, Reddit, you can do better. \n\nHowever, Numbers 35 clearly describes the punishment for murder: death if it was intentional, exile to \"cities of refuge\" if it was unintentional. Exodus 21 describes the punishment of a man who strikes a pregnant woman and causes a miscarriage: a fine set by a judge. Killing a man results in death or or exile, an unborn fetus is a fine. By comparing the punishments we can conclude that killing the fetus is not murder, the fetus is not afforded the same legal protections, therefore it is not yet considered a person or fully alive.",

Communicating a complex issue in a way peoole can easily digest is an incredibly powerful tool. \n\n\"Defund the police\" presents a person with an ultimatum. Either support the police or don't. You want to leave room for compromise anytime you're trying to convince someone of something. Lean into them. \n\n\"Defund the police\" is a bad headline. It doesn't do anything to convey the pragmatic message of reallocating funds to both help police and the public. Better de-scelation training and more funding for social services helps everyone. An aspect that got lost in miscommunication. \n\nThe point is marketing, branding, and easily digestible communication is paramount in influencing others on a large scale and it's something many progressive people outright refuse to get on board with. Compromise is a tough pill but necessary at times.",

Not only from the rights removed but the growing sense of hopelessness from those not in power. Racism, poverty, being rights poor, all pushing a growing minority (arguably a majority) to potentially look for more drastic solutions to their plights if these issues aren't addressed. As inequality grows so does the risk of civil unrest, even war if the gap is too large and the abuses too many. History shows this time and time again. French, English, hell the American civil wars were all really about a few holding too much power, wealth and influence and abusing this for their own end.",

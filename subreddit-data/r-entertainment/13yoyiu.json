Will it disappear from Hulu? \n\nHow can they get a tax write off for movies and TV shows that came out years ago? They\u2019ve already been watched. \n\nI get how HBO refusing to release a completed movie for the write off is shitty, but this is ten times shittier, no? They\u2019re taking away the Mighty Ducks\u2026\n\nThis is why we need piracy.",

They could have just had a massive Disney section and left the logistics up to the prexisting team (obviously integrated with whichever Disney people).

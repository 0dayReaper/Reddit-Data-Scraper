Sure, the show lasted a long time, but the main characters were basically set in stone before the pilot. Did they want the writers to steer off course in the name of diversity? For the early 2000's, I'd say the casting was quite diverse. Main characters get the main plotlines. That's how storytelling goes.",

God, if we could only cut his dick off and shove it down his throat.\u2019 At which point I said, \u2018You may want to temper the lynching imagery, lest you offend.\u2019 And I was very clearly angry,\u201d Owusu-Breen remembered. Another person who was present also recalled Cuse offering violent imagery of Eko\u2019s death in the trees in a way that immediately made them think of lynching.\u00bb",

I didn\u2019t read the Echo/tree part. That probably wasn\u2019t a good idea, but since a big part of that part of the story was about crashing in the trees in the jungle, I could see how they wanted a death tied to that.",

There was no fixation on them being a woman, or seemingly to check off a box on their list of what they deem to be values of women to celebrate and embrace. They just happened to be women who found themselves in very difficult, arduous conditions and overcame them, as any action hero would have. \n\nI don't see that same spirit echoed as much today per se, but I could be wrong. There is a difference between mainstream content for the big budget blockbusters and others. It's like how The Boys made fun of \"Girls Get It Done,\" which we saw embodied in Endgame with them making it a big deal that all women would come together and save the day there. It's just comes off as pandering.",

It can be overboard at times, but it's not good to have all female heroes just be gender swapped male ones. A mix of both is best, I reckon.\n\nAs an aside, James Cameron is having a lot of fun with gender tropes and roles in Aliens. Obviously, Ripley is the main one, but you also have the toughest marine being a woman (Vasquez), the hysterical one being a dude (Hudson), the most sensitive male marine being the best (Hicks) and motherhood looms large over everything with the film ending with a showdown between two Mums beating the crap out of each other. Aliens is all about feminine strength.",

I moved that scene (Get away from her, you *bitch*), but there is still a drastic difference in tone. Like, if you put a woman in the role of Schwarzenegger in True Lies for example, it'd still work. There's nothing wrong with approaching things in a mix. However, there's equally nothing wrong with pointing out that that's not necessarily what's going on with mainstream films either. \n\nThere are a couple of really badass ones with Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Jessica Chastain on Netflix. Or the movie Hanna. There are plenty of ways to address action movies with women characters that aren't just plain pandering to any given movement, but that's just me reflecting on movies I've watched since a kid in the 90s until now. It's not mutually exclusive. You can do both without it just trying to ram a certain narrative down the throats of the collective audience. And I liked the Endgame instance at the time. It wasn't with distance from the movie and seeing the mockery of that lip service being paid to it in the Disney/Marvel movies as compared to The Boys that it really hit me how ludicrous that particular scene is.",

Dark Fate WAS a deeper story than the other movies that came out post T2, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as good as T2. I think it\u2019s too similar to T3, and that was at least one of the better sequels in the franchise, though at the time it was hated until even worse entries were made and pushed it up the ranks.\n\nT3 at least expanded the lore and stuff, the rest were just T2 clones and reboots of a hurting franchise. If T3 hadn\u2019t come out, as well as Genisys (the villains are kinda similar), I think Dark Fate would have been received better. Since it came out after, it was too late to help the franchise, and felt like even more of the same stuff.\n\nI think the franchise needs a reboot with new actors, moving away from anything to do with the Connors or future war. Moving more into what the future is like, the difference between the Terminators and machines should be an interesting take. I mean, they can do more than shoot guns. \n\nI think the best thing is T1 was a horror movie and T2 was action, they should expand the genres past T2 in a similar way.\n\nOne thing I liked about T2 was the philosophical stuff behind the action - fate, our role in stopping the end of the world, and how humans too can learn to be more human and have hope, because a machine could. All that stuff was stripped out of the sequels besides the fate stuff being thrown around.",

Like many other people, I preferred that \"golden age\" look, but that's going on a tangent.\n\nArnold was especially not cut for a lot of his movie roles where it was more important to look big and menacing than it was to have visible striations.\n\nSo yeah, while I might not go as far as to guess Linda Hamilton had a lower bf% than Arnie, she was actually probably not too far off, and certainly way more cut in relative terms (male vs female).",

For 6 minutes, not 17.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fHI-HwVzcfo&amp;pp=ygUfYnJlbmRhbiBmcmFzZXIgc3RhbmRpbmcgb3ZhdGlvbg%3D%3D) \n\nI don't know if this guy is intentionally lying for internet points but it didn't stop him from speaking like he knows precisely what he's talking about.\n\nIt's scary how people just instantly believe something like this. Why? Because it sounds good, right? It sounds like he's really sticking it to this article? Intentional or not, it's misinformation. And you fell for it.",

The critics more recently are kind and are speaking well about it but not like its the best. Audiences are being more positive than Cannes. \n\nI suspect its an ok movie. Harrison carries it. Phoebe is funny. But the plot is ok. It may be that it seems to be jumping the bandwagon after 3 or 4 movies with basically the same mcguffin.",

It\u2019s mostly respectful to the actors involved for their prestige, regardless of the quality of the film they just saw that happened to feature them. \n\n\u201cThe Idol\u201d got an equivalent standing ovation at Sundance. I watched a pirated copy of it, to prevent giving it views if it was bad as previewers have said, and it was total garbage. Sexist exploitative garbage with nothing interesting to offer. I have little reason to believe this Indiana Jones will suck less than the Crystal Skull.",

It acts for you, it does your voice lines in games and cartoons. There is no getting tired and it\u2019s copying your art, your signature look and speech. \n\nYou want a character in a cinematic universe forever  - here is a path where the actor can do SFA and just makes sure they don\u2019t kidnap children.",

But the reason why I mention my European background is when I watch the punditry shows here on sports like soccer, cricket, rugby etc they\u2019re always very technical and, maybe it\u2019s just me, but I love it. I\u2019ve always been a purist so maybe I\u2019m in the minority but these shows have been going for years and are just as popular as ever. There\u2019s heated opinions sure, but it\u2019s always rooted in deep tactical analysis, play by play explanations, defensive formations etc. Like the one bit Cuban says about how they were dealing with LeBron. That was awesome. We get that kind of analysis *all the time*. \u201cThis is how we try to stop Messi, and this is what he did to adapt\u201d and so on. \n\nIf those shows can thrive here I don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t over the pond.

I don\u2019t care that a fictional character has been race swap but if you are selling a movie with the intention to cash grab using nostalgia don\u2019t be surprised if it fails in international markets as part of the nostalgia of the said character is removed. Appearance and presentation are part of nostalgia. \n\nThe current LTM live action adaptation is literally adapted from an original disney animated movie, a character with pale skin from a book that although has no racial theme to it can be assumed to be base in Europe whether that be the mediterranean or the atlantic or the baltic sea. Same thing with depiction flounder and ursula as those two characters are getting criticized for not trying hard enough to at least capture the appearance of the original animated version. \n\nIf Atlantis was made into a live action adaptation today and Kida is portrayed as a white girl or an east asian woman, are you also going to say that its okay to race swap it since it\u2019s fiction and that it\u2019s only a depiction of a person from a mythological setting even though how Kida looks like is part of the nostalgia",

Nostalgia is part of why disney made this movie, if disney cannot capture that nostalgia then it fails not only domestically but internationally as well.

I literally even use the analogy if Atlantis was brought to live adaptation and they messed up or race swap the character of Kida (another fictional character from a mythological setting as you argued in your previous statement with Ariel) that hypothetical adaptation would be criticized and might not fare well in the box office as it will fail to capture the said nostalgia.",

Btw also kinda ironic that Ariel is litterrally mute for a large part of the movie which should be compensated by strong acting skills, which wasn't Bailey's strong side, her face expression was the same the whole time. \n\nDisney cannot just rely on a portion of its domestic audience to make its movie financially successful. Without strong overseas numbers, they're doomed. They banked on approval from 12% of the African American population with a budget of $250million plus marketing. That's a bad business decision no matter which way you look at it. They took for granted the international crowd with their shitty decisions.",

I wouldn't want to wish that on someone else, 3) Studios make changes all the time to older properties and wonder why people get upset. It's illogical. If you made no changes fans would not complain as much. I was livid when they whitewashed Nani in the new Lilo and Stitch remake. 4) You have way too much of an all or nothing mindset. I never said I disliked black Ariel. I said I could watch the movie and in enjoy it just fine. If I was in charge I would have everything be as close to the original as possible. 5) If you want to make something different you might as well make a new thing.",

            "comment": "This is has been pretty controversial within brown circles. The mum did hit her kids infront of social workers and there was the force feeding which is common in South Asian houses. \n\nThe Netflix version dramatises her situation and shows her completely in the clear where the real mum had some parenting issues and there was some serious regarding the mother and the child's safety. The movie doesn't really address how toxic Indian parenting can be at times especially dealing with children with special needs. \n\nIt was such a wasted potential to discuss parenting in the west vs east and how we can learn from each other as opposed to one side being better than others.  I love my families Indian culture but when you migrate to another country you can't expect that country to accept all cultural norms and maybe some cultural norms shouldn't be continued but that's a whole different can of worms.",

It\u2019s not even about \u201cculture\u201d of the west, it\u2019s about the healthy way of parenting to ensure the safety and well-being (both physical and psychological) of the child. Desi family values are sooooo toxic in a lot of regards.",

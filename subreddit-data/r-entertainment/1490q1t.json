            "comment": "Genndy Tartakovsky\u00a0has let the dogs in.\n\nThe\u00a0Hotel Transylvania\u00a0and\u00a0Samurai Jack\u00a0director announced the actors who will voice\u00a0Fixed, his first R-rated comedy feature, which will follow a pooch who goes out for one final, wild night before he is set to be neutered.\n\nAdam Devine,\u00a0Kathryn Hahn\u00a0and\u00a0Idris Elba\u00a0lead the voice cast of the film, which Tartakovsky and producer Michelle Murdocca presented as a work-in-progress to the audience of the Annecy Animation Film Festival Tuesday night. The duo showed multiple clips from the Sony and New Line Cinema-produced film, which is set to deliver in September. A release date has not yet been set.\n\nPitch Perfect\u00a0star Devine plays Bull, a chubby but still intact pooch, who finds out his owners are about to give him the snip. His already-fixed buddies, Rocco (Elba), Fetch (Fred Armisen) and Lucky (Bobby Moynihan) decide to take him out for one last night on the town so he can get the most out of his balls before it\u2019s all over.\n\nHotel Transylvania, WandaVision\u00a0and\u00a0Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u00a0actor Kathryn Hahn plays Bull\u2019s neighbor and love interest, the glamourous show dog Honey who has an appealingly raunchy side.\n\n\u201cKathryn was an obvious choice,\u201d said Murdocca. \u201cWe had worked with her on\u00a0Transylvania, [but] she asked us to make Honey\u2019s dialog a little more brassy, to make her just one of the boys, so we went back and did a Honey pass, and that\u2019s where her character and personality really came out.\u201d\n\nBeck Bennett will voice Sterling, Bull\u2019s show dog nemesis. River Gallo and Michelle Buteau are also in the cast, voicing the dogs Frankie and Molasses, respectively.\n\nFixed\u00a0will be the first-ever R-rated comedy from\u00a0Sony Pictures Animation, and Tartakovsky admitted it has been a long journey to bring the project to the big screen. He said he originally pitched the idea back in 2009, before he became SPA\u2019s hitmaker, directing the first three films of the\u00a0Hotel Transylvania\u00a0franchise.\n\nThe project went through several iterations over the years, which Tartakovsky documented for the Annecy audience, tracing how the 3D CGI feature morphed into 2D, more traditional\u00a0Looney Tunes-style animation after New Line got onboard.\n\n\u201cIt helped with the budget, but 2D was what I wanted to do all along,\u201d said Tartakovsky. \u201cDog\u2019s balls just don\u2019t look good in 3D.\u201d\n\nJudging by the scenes screened at Annecy,\u00a0Fixed\u00a0will earn its R-rating. The sequences shown depicted dogs doing it \u201chuman-style,\u201d a doggie orgy and an extremely-bloody incident with an unlucky squirrel. The Annecy audience lapped it up.\n\n\u201cThis comedy was 10 times as hard as any actual thing I\u2019ve ever done, [so] hearing you laugh and hearing other people laugh at the other screenings, is just \u2018Phew\u2019!,\u201d said Tartakovsky, who noted that, \u201cOnce you get past the balls and buttholes, there\u2019s a lot of heart there.\u201d\u00a0",

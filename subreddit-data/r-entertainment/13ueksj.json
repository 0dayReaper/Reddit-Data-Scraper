When he dons the whole fascist personna,  he's becoming what he's hated his whole life. **WHICH HE TEARS DOWN AT THE END OF THE ALBUM BECAUSE HE REALIZES IT IS DESTROYING HIM.**\n\nThe whole fucking point of The Wall is recognizing that, amongst other unhealthy behaviors he had, and \"tearing down the wall\" so he can connect to humanity again with compassion and empathy. THE FASCIST PERSONNA HE'S PORTRAYING IN THE SONG CALLS OUT A MAN SMOKING A JOINT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! PINK FLOYD! THE BAND THAT WAS LITERALLY FAMOUS FOR CONSTANTLY BEING ON ACID(mostly) AND OTHER DRUGS.\n\n\nI know it's been 50 years, but Pink Floyd was some of the most progressive and simultaneously popular music of the 70's after the hippie bands died out. It's fucking mind-boggling how his criticism of Israel's treatment of Palestinians and then a world famous rock opera taken out of context somehow lead to trying to paint him as some Nazi. \n\nCritique his opinions on Israel till you're blue in the face, that's fair. But completely misrepresenting what he's doing is laughably outrageous, except it's not funny because people believe it.",

Python humor frequently subverted the expectation that any particular person or group would be the punchline or the target of a joke, and simply gave us situations where fairly benign things were behaving in a very silly way among other benign people and things behaving silly.  \n\nDead parrot doesn't have one character who is ridiculed and one who isn't.  Palin in that sketch is the ridiculous conman making excuses but Cleese gets more and more irate and his language becomes just as much of a joke as Palin's excuses.  Ditto all that again for Cheese Shop.  \n\nNeither Reg nor Loretta is the target of ridicule as being central to the humor.  The overall joke is about the over bureaucratic nature of the People's Front of Judea.  The joke could have been Loretta talking about what she wanted for lunch and the structure of the scene would be identical.  The Pythons chose to use trans people as the material for the joke because it was (in 1979) outside the typical scope of humor and because as a (again, to 1979 sensibilities) modern phenomenon, it would contrast nicely with the setting of the film.",

This is all a hypothetical basically from Cleese based on some supposed audience interview. Again, this movie is not in danger of being censored.\n\nThe Loretta stuff in the movie is actually light years ahead of its time, which is worth pointing out. Stan identifies as a woman named Loretta, and when she comes out, there is initially some resistance, from Reg, but eventually they all come around and accept her real identity, and Reg apologizes for dead-naming Loretta in a later scene. It\u2019s actually super progressive for the seventies I would say!",

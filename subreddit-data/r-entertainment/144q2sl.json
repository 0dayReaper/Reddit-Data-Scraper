Everyone wants more of what they love, and the MCU had an incredible run up to Endgame(even some beyond that is okay, like GOTG3), but\u2026a trilogy used to be the gold standard of a successful franchise and it kinda sucks that getting more in perpetuity is almost expected.  \n\nIt\u2019s feels strange as someone in my early 30s who grew up on these fantastic trilogies that stood on their own as almost monolithic pieces of entertainment\u2026.but who also grew up on their typically mediocre follow-ups, and was young enough to have my tastes be influenced heavily by the rise of Marvel\u2019s longer form storytelling.  \n\nThere\u2019s an impulse to try to milk a franchise forever, and it\u2019s not just coming from executives.  Fans demand it too.  \n\nAnd sometimes, on rare occasions, that can actually work out.\n\nBut somethings are not meant to run for ever, most things even(there are precious few franchises, such as Doctor Who or Star Trek, which actually thrive on the constant reinvention necessary for this to work out long term), and that\u2019s okay.",

Trilogies that tie into other trilogies that create a universe of trilogies that then upon completion need a reboot. \n\nJust never ends and it seems like nothing is new anymore. I mean Star Wars is 40+ years old and just now coming out with Vader? MCU and DC movies are nearing 20 years. \n\nI miss a time where a lot was left to just our imagination and new things came out instead of the 12th spiderman and 15th batman movie.",

If you have characters for 95+ years you might as well use them up rathe than taking risks creating new ones. Not only do you get the initial box office, but you get a century of residual profits from merch, streaming, etc.",

Under this premise, every successful movie would be repeated over and over again. That simply isn\u2019t the case.\n\nI think there are two things that cause this phenomenon. On the one hand, I think these movies are so popular because most superhero movie fans are less interested in the traditional qualities that movie critics look for in good films and rather have affinity for these familiar characters and storylines.\n\nI also think there\u2019s a significant level of propaganda in all of these movies and propaganda is designed to be well received by the target audience.",

And our state led R&amp;D can only take things so far without the real money needed for trials.\n\nKeep in mind a vast majority of drugs fail trials so the ones that make it through need to cover the R&amp;D costs of the failed candidates. It\u2019s easy to blame patents for price gouging but the reason prices are so high is the same reason why you get to enjoy the best, most cutting-edge, potent medications. Also partly the reason why companies decide to invest in rare disease treatments at all.\n\nThese policy ideas you have - I can tell they\u2019re designed to help the common man, but they will cause more harm than good. A lot of the creativity and ingenuity of the US has only come to shine because people are credited appropriately. A world without patents is a world where some tired, underpaid government researcher has to slog through hundreds of BS datapoints to slowly push drugs through the system. Barely any new drugs would ever make it out",

We're talking about music, movies, books, software and games. \"Content\" is the slurry you put into an Ubisoft game, AI training set, or black hat SEO site in order to make it seem artificially creative.\n\nSecond, creativity was not invented as a creature of copyright. People have been creating art since the beginning of time (e.g. before Queen Anne) and the end of copyright law would not mean the end of creativity. What *is* a creature of copyright is creative *industry*: the idea that art is a practice that one must specialize into and make a career out of. The world that copyright created is not one of individual authors making a living off their work, but massive teams of professional artists delivering art as a consumable product.\n\nIn other words, \"content.\"\n\nFunctionally speaking, the copyright bargain that today's media companies were built to exploit has already been broken. It was broken with the introduction of cassette recorders, VCRs, and copy machines. It's impractical and borderline unethical to enforce copyright law on individuals making private copies, so the only way for the copyright bargain to actually work is if, at large, individuals do not have the means to copy things.\n\n(This is also why DMCA 1201 is written so broadly and vaguely - creative industries needed a general purpose legal mechanism to scare the shit out of the \"[Boston Strangler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Valenti#Valenti_on_new_technologies)\" - i.e. normal people with copying tools.)\n\nSo if you couldn't create art without copyright, then the early 2000s filesharing boom should have completely killed off all creativity. It didn't - and believe me, *we tried*. Hell, there are even kinds of creative work which are explicitly prohibited by copyright law, such as fan art, game streams, cosplay, and so on. Copyright affords no protection to these (in the \"writ of outlawry\" sense) and people still make and do them anyway!\n\nWhat *would* change is creative industry. You see, industrial-scale production of *anything* is fiendishly expensive, but once you've found a 'hit', you can continue to produce the same thing basically for free. There's two risks with that, though: someone else might figure out how to free-ride on your success, or the market might just become saturated and lose interest. Modern-era copyright is designed to prevent the former case, and in the latter, ensure that at least you're the one eating the whole apple.\n\nIn a world where copyright was either pared down back to something reasonable or outright abolished, art and creativity would continue on. Hell, it'd probably continue to be profitable. You'd still have artists, singers, and actors able to make some kind of living. But you would have an entire class of below-the-talent-line creative professionals out of a job. And there'd be permanent [ressentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment) aimed squarely at the people who they think took their meal ticket away. I could imagine parades full of, say, out-of-work camera operators and sound engineers burning Cory Doctorow in effigy while calling for violence against the operators of BitTorrent trackers and sketchy IPTV rebroadcasters.",

You just need to be able to use CGI to make Scott big and small. But the rest of the time there doesn't need greenscreen akimbo. Just him and his crew going up against thieves, mob and the occasional low tier mad scientist to keep the Pym's in the picture. \n\nScott has a security company. That could have been a whole story in itself. Him and the others going up against a bunch of thieves that are running wild in the city. I would have watched that. I miss Scott's crew in the last Ant-Man movie. They were a highlight.",

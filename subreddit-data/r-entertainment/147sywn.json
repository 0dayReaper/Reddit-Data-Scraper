            "comment": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\u00a0star\u00a0Tenoch Huerta\u00a0is denying an accusation of sexual assault.\n\nOn Saturday, musician and activist Mar\u00eda Elena R\u00edos accused the actor of being a \u201csexual predator\u201d in a post on social media and followed it up by stating that the actor had sexually assaulted her. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to talk about the emotional abuse and the abuse of power of a sexual predator who is loved around the world for playing a character in a movie such as Tenoch Huerta,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOn Monday, Huerta released a lengthy statement denying the claims, calling them, \u201cfalse and completely unsubstantiated.\u201d He said that roughly a year ago he and R\u00edos had a consensual relationship that lasted several months.\n\n\u201cThroughout it was a loving, warm and mutually supportive relationship. After it ended, however, Elena began to misrepresent our interactions both privately and in front of groups of mutual friends,\u201d Heurta said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, a few months ago, I engaged a legal team to commence the appropriate actions to protect my reputation and refute these irresponsible and false accusations that can cause great prejudice and damage.\u201d\n\nHuerta had a lengthy career in Mexico before becoming known to global audiences with last year\u2019s\u00a0Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\u00a0as Namor, the classic Marvel character. He was also among the cast of Netflix\u2019s\u00a0Narcos: Mexico\u00a0and the feature\u00a0The Forever Purge. Though no formal plans have been announced for future Marvel appearances,\u00a0Wakanda Forever\u00a0strongly suggested there was more to come from the character.\n\n\u201cAlthough I am by no means perfect, I know that these allegations are simply untrue. And while I will always work to improve myself, I need to contest claims that are both false and offensive,\u201d the actor\u2019s statement continued. \u201cI am deeply grateful to my family and the people who have supported me and greatly appreciate everyone who is willing to look at the facts and reflect before rushing to an untrue and unjust conclusion.\u201d",

Punks made the mistake in the early days of trying to live and let live. It worked until the Nazi punks invited their mentally unstable Nazi friends who started straight up Nazi gang wars that led to the entire punk scene becoming a bloodbath until Punks threatened to (and many times did) kill Nazis for them to get the hint and cower in their shitty little nazi-only concerts.\n\nDo not let it get that far. Kanye is starting to whistle to them. They don't give a fuck about the music, they just want to be able to meet \"like minded people\". Make sure every fucking Ye crowd is full of people ready to beat their asses if they try to stick their swastika tatted necks out. Eventually they'll get the hint. And hopefully Ye will, too. IF that fucker wants to be their beacon, make sure they watch him and his career fall apart so they know-\n\nThey're\n\nNot\n\nWelcome\n\nEver.",

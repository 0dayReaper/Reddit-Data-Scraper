We have more tax cuts being proposed. Anti union work all over corporate America, some of which is blatantly illegal, but not facing consequence. A whole wing of the government dead set on killing safety nets. \n\nIn the end, the goal is to make us completely dependent without the ability to fight for ourselves. Not being able to say no and walk away. The extreme classes that would be left, should this kind of behavior go unchecked, would resemble those of Europe for most of modern history.",

But as long as we\u2019re using currency and labor the way we do, competition in a mixed economy is important. \n\nWe\u2019re way past needing to break up some of these companies.

Yes, some of those former countries are better now (not all of them) but the rest of the world has taken a turn for the worse.\nAs you pointed out, when communism was seen as a threat, capitalist economies had to keep their workers happy and living conditions competitive in order to avoid revolution (it doesn't matter if it was just paranoia and would have never happened, the perceived threat was there).\n\nAnd I'd argue its negative effects go beyond the purely economic. Cinema, music and art in general has become increasingly safe and dystopically subservient and unquestioning. I'd argue the fall of communism and the idea capitalism was the only possible system humans could live by, to the point of being unable to think of an alternative, had a huge toll on the arts, since its main drive has always been idealism or at least non conformity.\nArt whose main concern is just catering to the current zeitgeist of the time will almost always be bland, and I stand by my unpopular opinion. No matter what poptimists and other such groups may say.",

It\u2019s pretty much the opposite of what the article claims.\n\nStreaming has de-consolidated the last few years as everyone pulls content away from Netflix and Hulu and into their own platforms. These platforms are notoriously unprofitable, high overhead, and low revenue generating extensions of the much more profitable cable services. However, the cable revenues is declining and it\u2019s well known it will continue to decline. So companies are forced to spend large amounts of money on streaming in order to have any hopes at a future revenue stream. From there they are hoping it eventually turns profitable.\n\nStreaming is a bad business to be in, it likely will be until there actually is consolidation. Even Disney is a rumored acquisition target because of how bad the transition from cable to streaming has been for companies.",

Hulu and Netflix are currently the only profitable streaming playforms. Apple TV, Disney Plus, Peacock, ESPN +, and Amazon Prime are hemorrhaging money and are only sustained by their parent company's other hugely profitable business units.\n\nYou can look at Netflix to see what every streaming platform is going to have to become to survive. $5 Streaming platforms can not survive, and they are just trying to lure you in until they can consolidate and raise prices.\n\nYou guys can't have it both ways. You don't get to refuse to pay for your own Netflix account as grown ass adults, and then also side with the writer's strike who are fighting for better pay.",

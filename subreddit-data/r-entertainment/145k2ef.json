It feels like they are going to try and take a horror approach again with what producer is taking the helms.\n\nI personally think making it a serious horror movie is the wrong way to go. It was already tried and didn't work. They need to go back to it's roots and start making some hilariously bad leprechaun movies again.",

            "comment": "Lionsgate in gearing up for a new search for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\n\nLeprechaun, the longest-running franchise in Lionsgate history, will get a fresh start as the studio reimagines\u00a0the horror title for a new generation of moviegoers.\u00a0\n\nFelipe Vargas, helmer of the award-wining short film\u00a0Milk Teeth, will direct the new feature project that has a script by Mike Van Waes, who worked on the live-action\u00a0Lilo &amp; Stitch\u00a0movie that is now in production.\n\nRoy Lee, one of the Hollywood\u2019s horror lynchpins whose credits include\u00a0Barbarian\u00a0and the\u00a0It\u00a0movies, will produce via his banner Vertigo Entertainment. The company\u2019s Miri Yoon will also produce.\n\nLeprechaun\u00a0hailed from low-budget home entertainment producer Trimark Pictures who made the first movie in 1993 with Warwick Davis starring as a shoe-shining, gold-protecting, vengeance-dispensing leprechaun. The movie became notable for featuring Jennifer Aniston in her film debut but it also became a surprise theatrical moneymaker, launching a franchise that spanned three decades. Davis played the wily leprechaun in six films but skipped the last two, 2014\u2019s\u00a0Leprechaun: Origins\u00a0and 2018\u2019s\u00a0Leprechaun Returns. Davis is not expected to reprise the role for the new iteration.\n\nThe films became part of Lionsgate in 2000 when the company acquired Trimark, making the low-budget cult series on paper something that predates homegrown franchises such as\u00a0Saw,\u00a0The Hunger Games, and\u00a0John Wick. The films have shown an enduring popularity and Syfy Network runs a\u00a0Leprechaun\u00a0marathon every St. Patrick\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cThirty years after its debut, this franchise still casts a spell, and we\u2019re thrilled to be bringing it back with a new vision,\u201d Erin Westerman, president of production for Lionsgate\u2019s Motion Picture Group, said in a statement. \u201cRoy and Miri are two of our most trusted producers, especially with this genre, and we\u2019re excited by Felipe\u2019s vision for the film as a director. In his hands, this movie should be very scary and a ton of fun.\u201d\n\nMeredith Wieck and Jon Humphrey\u00a0will oversee for Lionsgate.\n\nVargas\u2019s short\u00a0Milk Teeth\u00a0told of a boy in an orphanage who sets of a tooth-separating frenzy amongst his fellow orphans when he finds a creature that trades coins for teeth.\u00a0Teeth\u00a0was a hit on the festival circuit, honored with a DGA Student Film Award and Imagen Award and winning an award at the Fantasia Film Festival.\n\nVargas is\u00a0currently set to direct his feature debut\u00a0Rosario\u00a0in Colombia.\u00a0He is repped by CAA, Magnolia Entertainment, and Gang Tyre.",

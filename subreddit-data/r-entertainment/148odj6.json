Personal therapy and understanding your own thoughts is excellent.

Your verbosity and reasoning seems very close to that of many individuals I have nursed who have been mentally unwell, here in the UK.

He has not been nearly as good as he once was for a long, long time. Not all his fault either. I\u2019m sure he is hamstrung creatively by the network suits and has to play ball accordingly. I so wish he would go the John Oliver route and get a show on HBO like Last Week Tonight where he can have the freedom to say what he wants but, I\u2019m sure he is getting paid like a king to stay put so I don\u2019t blame him.",

Even Conan\u2019s new show format in 2019-Start Of Pandemic was barely tolerable. His podcast/travel shows are incredible though.\n\nOverall, the entire late night TV format feels like it\u2019s on its way out.",

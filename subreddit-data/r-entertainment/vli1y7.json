Because any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous,' ... we have a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents,\" he said.*\n\nAbsolutely chilling. Look how quickly they pivoted from \u201cwe\u2019re gonna overturn Roe but don\u2019t worry we won\u2019t touch all that other stuff\u201d to Justice Thomas just absolutely fully and completely nuking Stare decisis in this quote.",

Just that, \"there's more to come\" with how much they're aiming to make massive decisions to cut back civil liberties and rights with the now-realized power to do so is terrifying. Even the thought that they're going to try and figure out how is terrifying.",

I've already replied it a few times though:\n\nNo, I'm not fear mongering.\n\nGrowing up this was preached often in church. My father used to donate to the organization \"Focus on the Family\" because of its prevalence in my state, and yes, it's outlandish view of divorce, its versions of science and also the apocalypse. My mother hesitated to divorce my father, because those who did in our church were frowned upon or left the congregation. She was raised Catholic, where divorce is also frowned upon. However, I was raised in non-denominational churches by my parents and lots of Christian beliefs were picked and chosen for them to teach.\n\nAnyways here's the [link](https://www.focusonthefamily.com/marriage/how-should-a-christian-view-marriage-and-divorce/) to Focus on the Family's views on divorce, and when they think it is warranted, which is only by unfaithfulness if you can't forgive, which is also considered wrong. Again, my parents supported their beliefs and tried to push that craziness on us kids.\n\nYes, divorce is frowned upon within the Christian religion. I don't doubt a light would be shined on this topic at this point. This is not fear mongering.\n\nEdit: a few typos",

Hear me out on this.\n\nBeing labeled as a racist these days is flat out bad. As the saying goes \"The only thing a racist hates more than other races is being called a racist\". Not a hard and fast rule, but a pretty reliable one, especially among the white people in the US that are racists. Plus there are just more than enough moderates who find blatant racism distasteful that the hardcore racists can't ignore them.\n\nPeople like Clarence Thomas, Candace Owens, Larry Elder, Ali Alexander, etc are *willingly* placing themselves as the token POC for the hardcore racists to be able to trot out as camouflage, and to soothe the consciences of the moderates. Plus one thing that's changed in the racist strategy since the 1960s is that actions go so much further than words or rhetoric. If you can reinforce racism on a systemic level through the justice/carceral system, disbursement of government funds, etc the actual end goal of suppressing other groups is met. Klansmen don't need to March through the streets shouting for segregation when the system does it for them without their input.\n\nSo. If the worst case scenario happens and the US tips all the way over the edge into Christofascism, with systemic racism liberally sprinkled in, people like Thomas aren't going anywhere. They'll be held up as proof to the rest of the world and to the more gullible citizens in this country that the US \"isn't racist\".",

Luckily I read the book in HS but I was fuzzy on the details so what did I do? First I bought a bunch of Adderal and then re-read the book entirely 2 days before the paper was due. Went to bed (if you could call it that). When I woke up the next morning I got a bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s I had and got good and drunk and let the word diarrhea flow. Banged out like 20 pages. I took a break, passed out, then edited the paper down to about 17 pages, and turned it in on time. Got a B+ so I considered that a win.",

That is what makes his Samuel L correct in calling out his omission of Loving vs Virginia. The case which gave him the right to marry his wife, in the state where he lives was decided upon due process. If he invalidates all those cases because of due process, he must include Loving vs Virginia as well. They just say Samuel L tweeted about it, but they gloss over the fact that he is making a better legal argument than Clarence Thomas is in his decision. Thomas is a hack who is making things up to justify the decision he reached prior to the case based on his conservative agenda. He\u2019s not interpreting the law, he\u2019s legislating from the bench.",

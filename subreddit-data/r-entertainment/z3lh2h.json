It gives me some nostalgia from better days when I used to watch it. At this point, it\u2019s sad how it\u2019s ending. A spin off with 2 or 3 characters in each show isn the same as when the whole group it together. Not having Daryl, Rick, Maggie, carol, Glenn, etc all together just means it should end imo.",

Maggie and Negan head to new york together (don\u2019t know why yet). and Michionne and Rick (how they come to find each other).\n\nedit: please for the love of god stop asking me how negan is with maggie, if you finished the show it would make sense.\n\nokay fuck it\u2026negan bascially gets captured by rick and thrown in jail, everyone wants him dead. carl saw a future where killing isn\u2019t necessary so rick tried to see it through. negan actually had a soft spot for carl. he spent 5 years in jail, occasionally getting visited by judith who would talk to him and ask why he did the things he did. he became human again, he began to reminisce on why he did the things he did. his wife was killed by cancer early in the apocalypse because a group of thugs wouldn\u2019t give negan the medicine he needed for her. he was apeshit and killed everyone, then began dealing with his grief that way. eventually carol let him out of jail to kill someone called \u201calpha\u201d who was threatening the main group. he succeeded but the group still distrusts him so they put him on working duty (basically slavery). a nasty snow storm hits and he basically ends up saving judith\u2019s life because she gets lost in blizzard. we learn he used to be a gym teacher and has a soft spot for children. his number 1 rule is no harming children. he grows pretty fond of judith because she reminds him of carl whom he deeply respected. after that he just slowly starts earning everyone\u2019s trust as a valuable member, but not as a respectable human. a group called the reapers attack, he helps maggie (despite her wanting to kill him the whole time) take them down. then he leaves, to find a new group, they let him go. we see him again in the last season with his new wife named annie, they are expecting a kid together. he\u2019s healed now and has a good heart. maggie and her kid are trapped in a huge apartment building with corrupt members of the commonwealth surrounding them. negan vows to protect maggie\u2019s child while she handles it. which he does, he understands how much a child life is worth now. negan wants to help take down the common wealth so he teams back up with the group. they end up getting caught and thrown in a labor camp, the groups plan gets snuffed out and negan takes the fall for everyone, takes a beating just so that they promise his wife gets to go free. final episode negan and maggie have a very healthy sit down where negan explains how horrible he feels for what he did, he deeply regrets ever doing it and understands if she doesn\u2019t forgive him, which she doesn\u2019t, but they respect each now and can move on.\n\nalso couldn\u2019t give two fucks when you stopped watching. i get it, you stopped when glenn died, almost everyone did.",

However, I think AMC pretty much put the show on life support the second they got a 2nd season. The original goals for the show had little impact imo.\n\nI don't remember all the details, but I distinctly remember they had bigger budget, less content demands to focus on, and of course the original show runners which either left or were fired later.\n\n1st season's a massive success with a healthy audience and afterwards AMC slashes budget, demands more episodes, and gets rid of its director for season 2...\n\nLike coming across a golden-egg laying goose and the first thing they do is ration its food, limit its water, and keep it confined in a small metal cage so it dies quicker... ridiculous.",

They must get off on intentionally destroying creativity. \n\nFrank Darabont had such a good thing going with Season 1, I wish we could have seen what would have happened if the people running AMC had more brains than the zombies on the show they air.",

She said she can't forgive him, no matter how hard she tries, but that he \"earned\" his place with their group. Then she said that every time she looks at him she sees Glenn dying and something like, \"so if there are days when I can't even look at you, that's why.\"!&lt;\n\nNot saying that it makes sense or anything, just filling you in since I suffered through all the way to end with this show. Once I start a show I pretty much have to finish.\n\nEdit: Also, after the time jump, Negan became one of the most moral, likeable characters on the show.",

I mean their policy was to essentially brutalize the neighboring communities and murder innocents as part of their operation. \n\nNegan's cruel murder of Glen and Abraham, not even as self-defense or part of a \"war\" is unforgivable. At least in times like with the cannibals, Rick was pretty much doing those horrible things as a defense. And it's not even as if Negan \"comes around\" too, they literally end up having like an all out war, and then toss him in jail for some reason despite murdering his army of lackeys.",

Realistically the show needed to end with either the zombies dying out/cure found or civilisation returning but it never happened. As you said everytime some semblance of civilisation and equilibrium established a new threat is invented by writers, so when the finale happens and they do civilisation returning/rebuilding once again it doesnt feel like a series finale because we seen it before in like every other season finale. \n\nI think they needed to have each season build to a final goal, have the seasons build to them finding a cure/eradicating zombies or realising thats its not practical to restablish civilisation and then end it there. But what they did was they kept setting the group with a new chance at a stable community and a hopeful future but they kept taking and then doing then doing the same thing for next couple seasons. This meant that the world felt like it evolved and so it didnt feel like there was any finality with the story.",

            "comment": "***From The Telegraph's Robbie Collin in Cannes:***\n\nThere\u2019s a sudden act of violence in the middle of La Chimera, the latest ethereally beguiling film from Alice Rohrwacher, which made me clamp my hand to my mouth in horror \u2013 even though it\u2019s perpetrated against a piece of statuary. Such is the singularity of this director\u2019s vision, her tender love of the Italian soil and the culture rooted in it.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen any of Rohrwacher\u2019s earlier work (Corpo Celeste, The Wonders, Happy as Lazzaro), you'll know how tethered it is to tradition, ancient mystique, the laws of the land. One early shot here could almost symbolise her art \u2013 there\u2019s a thread of red yarn attached to someone which literally disappears right into the earth, and we realise that its owner, trying to tug it loose, is in heaven.\n\nIt belongs to the late love of the main character, a forlorn Englishman named Arthur (The Crown star Josh O\u2019Connor), who has made himself a base with a tin-roof shack in the Etruscan countryside, beside a ruined old wall. He\u2019s a dowser, who can use a divining rod or just his natural antennae to sniff out relics underground, and as such has become the lynchpin of a small troupe of \u201ctombaroli\u201d \u2013 grave robbers.\n\nThe further down the film descends, the more transfixing its images tend to get, as if Rohrwacher and Louvart have teamed up on an archaeological dig for their own treasures of texture and light. Slippery as ever, this is a piece to meditate on, with its themes of honouring the past (the struggle to move on when mourning a dead lover) and severing connections with the sacred \u2013 as practised by the grave robbers with a braggadocio sad-eyed Arthur can\u2019t share. One man\u2019s scavenging jaunt could be another\u2019s Orphean journey to the underworld.\n\n**Read his review in full:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/la-chimera-cannes-review-josh-oconnor/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/la-chimera-cannes-review-josh-oconnor/)",

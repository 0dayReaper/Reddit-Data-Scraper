            "comment": "&gt; \u201cI very much played into it at the beginning, but now I\u2019m worried it\u2019s gone too far,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s still loving it; I need to ask him. He\u2019s a global phenomenon as he should be, because he\u2019s pretty spectacular.\u201d \n\n&gt; Most recently, during The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s annual Drama Actor Roundtable, it was noted that 1.5 million pages turn up when Pascal\u2019s name and \u201cdaddy\u201d are googled. During the chat, The Mandalorian star clarified that while he is \u201chaving fun with it,\u201d the narrative \u201cseems a little role-related.\u201d\n\n\n&gt; \u201cThere was a period where the Mandalorian is very daddy to baby Grogu, and Joel is very daddy to Ellie,\u201d he explained. \u201cThese are daddy parts. That\u2019s what it is.\u201d\n\n\n&gt; Pascal then proceeded to playfully say, \u201cI\u2019m not a daddy and I\u2019m not going to be a daddy.\u201d\n\n\n&gt; He has also previously described himself as a \u201ccool, slutty Daddy\u201d during an interview in January with Entertainment Tonight. And last year, he called himself a \u201cbigger daddy\u201d than Oscar Isaac during Vanity Fair\u2018s lie detector test. \u201cI\u2019m older than him,\u201d he added at the time. \u201cAlthough, he\u2019s a real daddy. He\u2019s got kids and I don\u2019t, but daddy is a state of mind.\u201d",

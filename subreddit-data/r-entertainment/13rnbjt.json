This is a convoluted credit system that makes the card seem more like a pre-paid system:\n\nYou pay anywhere from 10-40/month for credits that can get you a number of movies that varies based on everything from the date and time of the showing to the state you live in.\n\nThis wont last any longer than the original iteration. And that one was actually appealing.",

It was hard to come out ahead, especially when the same few movies would be in all the theaters.\n\n$10/ mo even if you just to get one movie a month is now a pretty good deal, at least in my market.",

From the Rockies, to Appalachia, to the plains that seem to go on forever and ever, the deserts and the arctic, to the Pacific Northwest which has the worlds LARGEST LIVING ORGANISM (fungi!!!!!!!!!!!), there are weakening environmental protections that haven\u2019t even been in place for all that long to begin with. \n\nThe owning class wants the resources and they\u2019re going to take them, totally sanctioned by the government. How sad is that? \n\nBack home my state government is constantly trying to weasel themselves into controlling Chickasaw Nation land and finances. It\u2019s not enough that we took an *entire region* of the continent from them and put them on this land in Oklahoma, we never stopped trying to take what relatively little land is still theirs to control. Luckily since the Chickasaw Nation is savvy, and far smarter than the conservative state government, so far they\u2019ve held Kevin Stitt off. \n\nBut that\u2019s just the struggle between one of the Nations and a state government that I personally know a lot about. I can only imagine that it\u2019s constant near any treaty land.",

He started off being a 100% incompetent jerk with the recall campaign, and was terrible early on.\n\nThen he got pragmatic, worked with the democratic legislature, and actually started to come around.  I think even before that, he converted his HMMV to electric, having finally recognized climate as more important than tough guy branding.\n\nI don't know if it was Maria Shriver leaving over the embarrassing secret kid or what, but I think it genuinely been life experience, taking the knocks and learn that has brought him around.",

He did some good while he was there but had a mixed legacy. \n\nThe evolved Arnold is much better though. An earlier example of this was his video directed towards Russians at the start of the Ukrainian-Russian war. It was an amazing effort to connect with the Russian people and explain why the war was a bad thing.",

She could put on her yoga pants and there would be a few dudes panting after some casual strange. It could easily be a daily occurrence. It's so simple now too.    \n\n\nYou would never have to know. And these men, who make a habit of being easily available are usually willing to be discrete. Why would they want an entanglement?  You will never know exactly how many easy offers your wife turns down to be faithful to you.   \n\n\nI know people could talk all day about how it's different for men. The temptation. But why would your unfaithfulness be any less painful to her? Surely you and your wife are equal in that? \n\n  \nIt is strange that a woman may choose to be faithful, turning down offer on offer, but so many men seem willing to admit that deep down they don't know if they would do the same for their wife.",

And it was pretty well earned, California is only now recovering from some of the economic and environmental damage he did.\n\nA week after he left office, it was revealed he had been in an affair with his maid, and conceived a son born a couple days before his wife Maria Shriver gave birth to his other son. So his approval rating could have been even lower if the tabloids hadn't (respectfully) sat on that story until he was out.\n\nI think that was something of a turning point in his life though, as he's been a good father to all of his kids and a pretty wholesome media presence ever since then. Some people are better of not being in power and simply doing what they're naturally good at.",

Helped a lot of people, but he harmed a lot more people than he helped because he was a sociopath with little boundaries. Another example: I was close with a comic and podcaster and he flipped and started doing the ol' Louis CK offstage \"bit\" of exposing himself and jerking off to women without their consent. I told a lot of people, and many people stopped following, watching him, but some stuck around and berated me, telling me what a nice guy he is, and he would never do something like that, even though he said it himself on multiple interviews he did these things. Truly incredible how some people will always make excuses for abusers because \"they are nice to me!!!\" Yea dude ofc otherwise they would likely be in prison.",

But there\u2019s also cases of person trapped in a loveless marriage with kids so it isn\u2019t an easy escape.  Someone close to me was married to someone who was constantly miserable and brought everyone down.  They had a kid whom they dearly love, but the relationship with the wife was fucked.  Pretty scummy, but I think they ended up cheating.  The final straw that destroyed that marriage was their son from a previous marriage came out (they fully supported them), but the wife\u2019s kid from a previous marriage was super homophobic.  The person asked their wife to talk some sense into the bigot, but the wife just gave a \u201cboth sides\u201d response.  This is when the guy decided to end the marriage.  Last I heard the wife is now using the kid as a weapon in the divorce.",

People often just look the other way because they don't want to get divorced for whatever reason and tolerate the cheating as long as it isn't out in the open where they are *forced* to acknowledge it.  If it becomes public knowledge, they are humiliated by it and/or are forced to reckon with it because now other people know and know that *they* know.  Some couples just have an unspoken understanding but they don't want it out in the open and just want to keep the mirage of the perfect, normal marriage intact for the world to see.  I can't imagine being in a marriage like that, but I've definitely seen this kind of thing.",

I believe a fair number of us are.

Today I bought a coffee, when that money could\u2019ve gone to malaria nets, statistically likely to save a life or two (unless Bill has that completely covered these days). \n\nI could go on.\n\nMy point is two fold: 1) almost none of us is \u201cgood\u201d (possibly Peter Singer) as some sort of clean cut, up or down thing, 2) while that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t condemn someone for, say, punching a pregnant woman in the abdomen (I cannot imagine a more clear ish cut singularly \u201cbad\u201d action), I think it should inform all of us that perhaps the best \u201cgood\u201d most of us can manage is \u201cless bad\u201d and \u201ctrustable in general.\u201d\n\nI submit old Arnold was not trustable in general, although I\u2019d trust old Arnold over Weinstein; any day and twice on Sunday - and current Arnold is probably pretty trustable.",

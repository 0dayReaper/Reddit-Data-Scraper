They did all this world building for three movies and then Winston gets John to kill the Marquis so he can get his hotel back I guess(?). The final showdown green screen looked bad. There was more CGI than an Avengers movie and the end credits were proof of that. CGI John bouncing off cars didn\u2019t look all that good. Lots of sped up action and clipped frames to make action appear faster. I wish there had been more practical effects.

IMO, the speed of fighting looks slower compared to the previous ones, and the timing was a bit off to me with some of the fights. I also understand Wick is getting old, maybe because of that.

Oh and the bullet proof jacket lol that is a bit ridiculous.

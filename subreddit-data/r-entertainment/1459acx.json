Also since they weren\u2019t running stories on his suit it drives home the fact they didn\u2019t treat it and Trump\u2019s indictments as equally important, which was the point of my response, which would have been the important thing to focus on.",

I dont actually blame conservatives initially, for this, they are just more prone to capitalizing on the outcome.  \n\nTalk radio and long news programs started the consequence of filling air time.  Instead of short poignant news stories, we have people who are breaking down the news and telling us why that news is good or bad.  Its built in to the programming to avoid boredom.  If your ratings are better because people are emotionally invested, then you start to focus just on that aspect.\n\nI don\u2019t actually think it was a concerted effort to ruin news.  Its just a byproduct of chasing money. \n\nI would add though that conservatives are very much keen on using this new development as a tool to gain control and money.  Be on the lookout for all major news program/sources  to be bought and paid for by greedy people.  Just like Elon and Twitter,  and with the new CNN.

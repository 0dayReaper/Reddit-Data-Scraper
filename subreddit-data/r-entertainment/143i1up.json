            "comment": "&gt; But having intensively covered two prior such strikes, in 1988 and in 2007, **I\u2019ll risk one modest observation about the current conflict: If it continues as at present for another few months, it will begin to shift the cultural balance of power.**\n\n&gt; **In the past, at least in the modern era, Hollywood\u2019s labor wars haven\u2019t had much bearing on the socio-political life of the country as a whole.** Whether guild writers plied their craft or sat out for five months, George Herbert Walker Bush was going to bury Michael Dukakis in the presidential election of 1988; that\u2019s how the current was running.\n\n&gt; Indeed, **it was only post-Trump, with the election of 2016, that many movies, much series television and most late-night talk became noticeably aligned (with some exceptions, say, Gutfeld! or Real Time with Bill Maher) with a progressive point of view** that is as proudly on display in this year\u2019s pro-gun control season finale of Law &amp; Order as in the films or Jay Roach and Adam McKay or the monologues of John Oliver and Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n\n&gt; **Contemporary Hollywood is a powerful, vocal, left-leaning cultural and political force. The Oscars and Emmys annually underscore its core beliefs.** Jane Fonda, with her recently expressed notions about climate, patriarchy and racism, is more rule than exception.\n\n\n&gt; **But most of it requires writers, who, for the moment, aren\u2019t writing.**",

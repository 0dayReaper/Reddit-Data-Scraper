If a single ship going to light speed can destroy an entire army, then why would they have all these battles? Why not have a couple unmanned ships just fly into the death star, or the super star destroyers, or any of the huge enemy stations from any of the movies. That one be scene made the stories of all the other movies nonsense.",

Why would they use those slow moving bombers when they were previously using y-wings. \n\nThe answer is R.J. wanted a WW2 style bombing scene and fuck the canon. \n\nTLJ was R.J. shitting on everything J.J set up and then RoS was J.J doing the exact same thing back to him. IMO it's worse than the prequels. At least the prequels had a vision, the new movies are just a jumbled mess of half-baked ideas.",

They're not supposed to make any sense.\n\nThe idea of using spaceships chasing each other within 50 feet is insane. We don't even do that *now*, never mind with spaceships.\n\nIf you want hard sci fi with realistic space battles, see things like the Expanse, where ships shoot at each other from 10's of thousands of kms away, and pray their point defence or blind luck stops them from getting destroyed.",

A single star fighter destroyed the Executer, at the time the largest star destroyer ever built. The battle in rogue one sees dozens of ships crashing into and destroying others. It's not the only occasions crashing your ship into someone else has that reaction. It happens once or twice in Rebels, and I'm sure it happens in TCW series.\n\n The hyperspace jump is blown out of proportion honestly. In order for it to work you have to be at reasonably close distance because it happens in the process of jumping to hyperspace, and also you have to survive any oncoming enemy fire,  and because you're jumping to hyperspace you have to wait for your ship's computer to calculate the jump so it takes time, and all of that is no different than any other ship crashing into another. I'm almost inclined to say its harder because your jump point is a fixed destination so you have to match the direction of your destination with a moving target",

I liked the evolution to a actual balance. It was suggested in non-canon stuff from Lucas arts days. I can see why but I did feel everything JJ did was to make the most money without rocking the boat. These are core films they should change how I feel about the universe. But force healing is not the way. It doesn't make sense given all the previous films.\n\nEdit: like this just my opinion, I didn't like the last film and found TFA boring, TLJ definitely had its issues but I felt it had something to say.",

I did audibly gasp in the theatre though, absolutely breathtaking in person, A+ for cinematography and CGI, D- for writing.",

The TLJ wasn't 'good', It lead the story into a corner with no clear plan of where to go from there and it broke the way space travel works in star wars but it was at least watchable. The RoS was awful in just about every way a story can be awful. It was cartoonish in how dumb it was, like they had a brain storming session specifically to come up with ways to make a really dumb movie. To ice the cake It even managed to also break star wars space travel in its own way in that opening sequence where they jumped around like they were in the guardians of the galaxy universe.",

Beating up leobron in front of the white house would be the worst thing ever I feel for every president. Is there a reason for that? money should not be a problem for someone like him.\nYou can say whatever you want but a leader would I think actually work wonders like in most successful protests.

Imagine if he was to be in the middle of a protest, his 6\u20199 frame would stand out like a sore thumb. It would even be more ridiculous if he has security all around him. Would that be fair to the protesters? Knowing the internet, they would get on him for having a security detail during a protest. What happened if police and his security details start engaging in physical violence. LeBron has been extremely vocal when it comes to movements that impact his community with sometime going above and beyond. Think of the biggest football superstar in Europe and put him in one of biggest protest in the one of the most populated cities in Europe. How would that go?",

I get that there are a lot of trolls and bad-faith actors on social media, but I doubt Boyega took the time to suss out of that account was legit or not. Boyega has specifically embraced his Nigerian heritage and that person said they were Nigerian. What are the chances they were just trying to connect with an actor they liked and didn't know what specific event Boyega was tweeting about?",

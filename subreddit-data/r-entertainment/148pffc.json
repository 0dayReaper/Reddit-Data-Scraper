Make-A-Film Foundation partners with noted Hollywood talent to grant wishes to kids with serious or life-threatening medical conditions and has previously worked with Depp on a short film.\n\n&gt; The other organizations also have Hollywood connections, with The Painted Turtle \u2014 a free-of-charge summer camp near Lake Elizabeth in California for children with life-threatening and chronic illnesses \u2014 being co-founded by Paul Newman, and the natural and cultural conservation efforts of Tetiaroa Society serving the tiny Marlon Brando-leased atoll near Tahiti.",

Abuse changes a person and mutual abuse is an outdated myth and is damaging to victims. It's an established fact that victims DO initiate physical fights in certain instances. Whether it's out of fear or a proactive type of self defense because you think someone is about to hit you first for example. Amber had proof showing abuse for years before she ever started to fight back. The audios played at trial were all from the last year of the relationship. Nevermind the fact that those audios were edited by Depp to change the context of the discussion.",

Those recordings are like seeing person burning a cat with cigarettes and someone tries to talk that its out of context. \n\n&gt;The full transcripts came out in the unsealed documents from the US trial, and show Heard saying she reacted the way she did because she thought Depp was going to murder her, because he had been so violent with her before.\n\nNope. No such thing in the transcript I read when called out on similar claims and ask for a link and a page.\n\nUsually when someone points out that in all her verbal abuse, that sounds like straight out of narcissist prayer, she not once mention any physical abuse coming from him. When she is arguing her many points about why her punching him is ok.\n\nSomeone comes in with claim how she in fact did mention it, but no audio only transcript. And so they link the transcript and I read it, and it turns out that when she says being \"hurt\" and \"bruised\" in torronto fight she meant feelings. He supposedly told her she is ugly, old and that her tits sags, he says he dont remember half the things she claims. But no, in the hours of audio she not once claim talks about some instance of him physically assaulting her, and people latched on that \"hurt and bruised\"\n\n[the transcript, page 578 for like twenty pages](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/a5c67c18-f1c1-4485-b1dd-fbfba0ae3f0c/downloads/29%20-%203.22.22%20-%20Defendant_s%20Memo%20in%20Support%20of%20.pdf?ver=1659126339481)\n\n&gt;do some research and get with the program.

The case was a civil suit where they try to determine if something likely happened. The bar is low and there are more often than not zero evidence other than testimony. Someone heard at that time about the event from amber? Not witness it, just heard about it? Yeah, it probably happened. No witness and no other evidence just her and his words? Well there is pattern and there were drugs, it probably happened. \n\nIt really  shows why criminal justice system operates on different level.\n\nHer supporters really latch on that, but once you heard enough of that audio and hear how she is in private, the judgment itself really loses on value.",

The point is that insane Depp supporters have cried for years now about Heard saying she donated money when she had pledged it, and she was vilified as a liar who stole money from sick kids.\n\nEven though she had a written plan for when to pay the two charities she chose, but had to stop the payments because Depp kept suing her. As proven in the unsealed documents from the case, Heard had to spend 6 million on legal fees before she got insurance and was therefore unable to continue her payment plan. This does not make her a liar or a thief, it makes her someone who gave 1.3 million to charity and was vilified for not giving away more than she was able. \n\nDepp has been worth 150 million dollars and now used the money he got while continuing his abuse of his ex wife, to do the exact same thing Heard did - pledge the money to charity. \n\nBut now it\u2019s totally fine apparently, because now pledge is fine. \n\nThe point is desperate hypocrisy.",

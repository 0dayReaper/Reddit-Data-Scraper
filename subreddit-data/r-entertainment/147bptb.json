Bc feeling different about what a father looks like doesnt necessarily point to someone feeling disphoria. Feeling very uncomfortable/depressed about being thought of as a woman/man, being referred to as a woman/man, that edges into the function of non binary.\n\nAnd I think when you were talking abt getting rid of stereotypes or gender entirely, that would be agender/nongender. Nonbinary isnt the rejection of gender but as others have said a third separate label where ppl feel much better being thought of and referred to as something different.",

I think reading/listening abt first person non-binary reports/stories (and not a select few) would be a good start.\n\nAs far as the nb ppl in my life are concerned, I\u2019ve noticed that the ppl assigned female at birth tend to notice early on in childhood that being female and being expected to act/look a certain way immediately stigmatizes the binary in their worldview. The labels and the behaviors/appearances are closely related for them. And boys don\u2019t have it much better. So if someone was to reject the binary and the appearances/social behaviors, then that\u2019s more liberating for them. \n\nAnd men and women can also feel the burdens of their gender too, but not as strongly to go out of their way to change their pronouns/looks/name. Like I don\u2019t feel weird dressing like I do and being referred to like I am, but for the ppl that feel uncomfortable being thought of as a male or female, identifying as nb is the ideal.\n\nFood for thought but if everyone was given the chance to change their pronouns and have all their community accept them and immediately use their desired pronouns and not be alienated, bullied, or flat out ignored, I\u2019m sure more ppl would come out as nb. Gender and disphoria exist on spectrums, and social pressure adds a whole other layer of complexity.",

I thought the other approach was really positive and a nice big \"fuck you\" to damaging gender norms. I agree with the OP who said that non-binary reinforces the idea that gender norms are legit, which seems counterintuitive.\n\nBut I do want people to be happy in themselves, of course. I guess I'm curious about how the definition helps you feel more yourself? It's something I want to understand more, if you (or other NB posters) are happy to explain.",

It's not an intrinsic meaning, it's an assigned meeting to this societal construct we call gender.\n\nThis may sound like an oxymoron, but you will find most elements of culture and society follow a similar principle - for example we know religious interpretations have change over time based on current events, but that doesn't change its meaning to those who subscribe to that religion. Race is another great example - we know there is no scientific definition of race, its a cultural definition with no firm boundary and it has changed over the years, yet it still matters. Racism still exists. Dictionaries do not dictate meaning, they reflect the meaning of things as we use them in the real world. \n\nNon-binary gender expression is the same way. Binary gender expression is still the norm in our society, but that is changing. The gender binary still exists, there *are* gender norms, and there are people that exist outside of that. This is a natural evolution of our societal construct of gender.",

Maybe someday our society will have progressed past the need for gender, but in the meantime, gender is still an idea with value - trans people are living proof. I don't think anyone would argue binary gender expression is inherently problematic, the only issue is when it's treated like an absolute. Same thing with religion, race, etc. It's important to acknowledge these things are part of your identity and have value as such, but it doesn't mean they define you (in fact you define them) *and* that value they have is not absolute.",

Is there even a consensus on what it *means*? Judith Butler not only popularized the term \u201cnon-binary\u201d, but arguably was the largest influence on our contemporary understanding of gender identity, and they argued that gender *is* performance.\n\nSure, you can cross-dress without being non-binary, and be non-binary without \u201ccross-dressing\u201d, but if so, what does it *mean* beyond simply identifying as so? If presenting outside of the gender binary is not the meaning of being non-binary, and if there is no essential origin, then the meaning must be completely up for interpretation. What is the non-binary experience outside of personal identity and expression? Do most people experience their inner-world through a strict gender binary? \n\nTo argue that being non-binary is essential, you\u2019d have to also argue that the gender binary is essential, but we really have no way to define the gender binary outside of sex and gender roles. To equate gender to sex would amount to the erasure of transgender people, but to equate gender to *gender roles* would amount to honesty more than I can unpack in a Reddit comment, though gender roles are ultimately a matter of culture and/or personal choice\n\nTo assume gender is 100% physiological is not only a slippery slope, it also disregards that there is no clear consensus on what gender even is. Most intersex people identify within the binary, so it is not just a matter of endocrine abnormalities leading to people identifying as non-binary. Even within the study often cited, it is inconclusive, though there are multiple studies that argue against a physiological cause. There is no proof of a physiological origin. Ultimately, no human physiology proves essential gender (or lack thereof), wether you identify as non-binary or not. \n\nDefine what it means to be non-binary without using gender expression or gender norms in the description. And if the answer is that you \u201cdon\u2019t feel like you belong within the gender binary\u201d, how is that proof of gender essentialism? How do you define the gender binary without gender norms and gender expression?",

Did you actually read the reviews? And watch the YouTube reviews?\n\nAnyway saying he or Sweeney Todd was robbed when people clearly didn't read the reviews is a bit of kick in the bucket. You can either read the reviews and understand why it didn't sweep or not. And when you dig enough it's just that Groban doesn't come across quiet as menacing as the role would allow, but what would I know it's not like I read the reviews or anything to understand why he didn't win.",

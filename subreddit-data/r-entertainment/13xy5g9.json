You'd either have jerky stop motion models, or people in suits like Godzilla, Power Rangers, etc.  Transformers I think, are a rarer example of CGI coming out right, I feel.  \n\nWith regards to practical effects though, Michael Bay has said outside of the character models, he has always prefered to use \"the real thing\", explosions made with large amounts of explosives, and crashing real cars and trucks on the highway for instance.",

Sheen, light sources, drying time and style, thickness are all factors in how paint looks. To really get a good match you need time, paint samples to tint, a few tries precise ads accurate dispensors, etc. It's not easy or cheap. That's why the paint store people aren't going to want to do it. And a spectrophotometer is only so good. Actually, I don't know what the state of the art is today for them. But in my time it would only give you a starting point.",

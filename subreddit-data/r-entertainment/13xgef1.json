There was a giant picture of John Coltrane on the wall behind a musician, sitting directly below it, I was talking with, and my brain was trying to make sense of something that was confusing. When I realized I was talking with Ravi Coltrane, John\u2019s son, and that they look so similar I said \u201cwowwww\u201d out loud. Like I knew he was his son but it took the comparison to really make that click.",

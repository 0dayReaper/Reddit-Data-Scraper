The one thing I really enjoyed about the Craig Bonds is they tried (more so than ever before anyway), to make many of the women more than just eye candy, they gave him and his love interests significantly more depth. I need my Bond to have that depth, I don\u2019t like Bond just being a \u201cblunt instrument,\u201d as M so succinctly put it in CR. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m scared to death with with her do with the blood. I\u2019m a physician and former military bubba, I can tell you from personal experience no human being bleeds as much as literally ever Tarantino character bleeds.

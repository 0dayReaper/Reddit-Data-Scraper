She\u2019s won as many awards and is as commercially successful as Elvis and Michael Jackson, yet no one tries to discredit their artistry saying that their mommy actually ran their careers. She had financial help from both her parents when she was starting out, but has consistently written her own songs and controlled her own image over more than a decade. Every artist who has worked with her said she is incredibly talented, Andre Lloyd Webber said she is one of the most talented lyricists he has ever worked with. If you don\u2019t like her music, fair enough, but I think it\u2019s worth reflecting on why you are so quick to take away her agency and credit her success to her father and her team, and consider - do you jump to the same conclusions with equally successful male artists?",

Claims she\u2019s a feminist, supports LGBTQ+ etc.\n\n\nWhen rumours first started dropping about her dating Healy, people on the internet started bringing up things he has said/done that are problematic, including supporting a controversial podcast (redscare), making racist comments about Ice Spice, and admitting to watching Ghetto Gaggers.\n\nPosts/comments about Healy\u2019s behaviour gained traction and Buzzfeed posted an article which was, according to some, buried by Taylor\u2019s PR team. Multiple articles were subsequently ran in the press, essentially arguing that Swift should not be responsible for Healy\u2019s behaviour and that it was misogynistic to judge Swift for associating with Healy, which pissed people off more. Many people started saying Swift was only being performative in her activism to help her career.\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to say what led to their breakup, some have speculated it\u2019s due to this backlash. You can form your own opinions as to whether that backlash is warranted or not.",

Where it\u2019s a team of people who decide what she does next, including who she dates. This was very common place in Hollywood back in the day and still is scene time to time (like with Taylor). \n\nWhat\u2019s even more ironic is the so called \u201cfans\u201d act like this take is total bullshit when they themselves got choked up in a Taylor swift doc that she couldn\u2019t stand up for women\u2019s rights as they where being attacked because daddy and her team said that isn\u2019t best. She has never truly been able to be herself. She is what the label and Hollywood wants you to think. Not what she really thinks. \n\nIt\u2019s sad truly. But what\u2019s sadder is the very fan girls who watched her not be able to stand up for women are the very ones who truly think these month long relationships built on PR and press are legit and not at all just for clicks. \n\nShe will never get married as long as her label and team are who control her. As it\u2019s how they sell albums.",

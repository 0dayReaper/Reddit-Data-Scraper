The entire time I'm seeing nothing but trump signs everywhere out in the country where I live. They went all the way up to election day telling me Clinton was beating him.\n\nI had already been calling bullshit on a lot of their reporting before 2016 but it became too much that they were obviously reporting their feelings instead of reality. That's not news.\n\nEdit: not a Trump supporter",

So how should it be phrased?\n\nThe car was driving 20mph over the speed limit.\n\nFixed. The statement is now factual and doesn\u2019t try to influence the reader\u2019s opinion. The reader can decide for themselves if that\u2019s too fast or not.\n\nSometimes when I\u2019m out for breakfast I\u2019ll take a paper and start crossing out unnecessary descriptors in articles. It\u2019s mind blowing how short articles become. The Sun (Canadian paper) in particular is guilty of this.\n\nEdit: awards, huh? Thanks pals.",

This creates an echo chamber.  You will always be malnourished. \n\nYou need to read from a wide variety of sources.  You need to read the sources those sources cite.  You need to read the statements governments and individuals make, directly, and then the interpretations and reactions to those statements. \n\nIf that seems like a lot - well, it is.  Knowledge and truth are not simple distillations.  They are complex perspectives, forcibly assembled and tested.\n\nA \"diverse set of sources\" doesn't mean \"watch Fox AND CNN\". \n\nIt means reading from *wide* varities of publications.  Learn reporters' names.  Learn who is factual, and who is biased.  Everyone has biases.  Everyone.  You need to understand waht the bias of each and every person and news source is, so that you understand where their reporting is strong, and where it's weak.  Where they will be honest, and where they will obfuscate the truth.\n\nIf your primary source of information is just one fucking guy at a desk talking at you - it's probably less than worthless.  They're not telling you the truth.  They're making money off manipulating you.",

Since then there have been many changes to the programming, but a lot of people have noticed there seems to be an effort to attract, for lack of a better term, \"Fox News\" viewers.  Which means more of conservative/republican types, and more \"both sides-ism\".\n\nHowever the problem with this is that \"Fox News\" viewers have been told they can't trust CNN and other places because \"fake news!\" so this approach was just causing more and more people to tune out CNN, and the ratings tanked.\n\nSo on Wednesday CNN put on a what they called a town hall meeting for Trump in New Hampshire, where he said his normal stuff and then people at CNN acted like they were shocked he said that stuff.",

They got to laugh at a woman he raped. They got to deny his attempted coup. They get to ignore the millions of dead Americans killed through his lack of leadership during Covid.\n\nIt's a slice of fucking hell, and it was 100% predictable.

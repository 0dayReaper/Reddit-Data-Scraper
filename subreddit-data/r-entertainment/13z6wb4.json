            "comment": "***From The Telegraph's Simon Heffer:***\n\nWhat makes Novembre such a superb film is that, despite the disclaimer that it is only based on real events and that some characters are invented, it sticks pretty closely to the documentary evidence of what happened over those five days, and tells the story with great clarity. Dujardin is admirably supported by another well-known French star, Ana\u00efs Demoustier, who plays one of his senior officers whose passion to catch the terrorists nearly leads to the whole operation unravelling.\n\nAlthough Jimenez can be interpreted as having set out to create a thriller, he does not stint in showing the effect such an operation has on the emotions and psychology of those having to conduct it. In that respect, one of the most satisfying scenes in the film is a confrontation between Fred and a prime suspect, in which strict professionalism comes second to personal feelings. Yet the film never strains credulity, and is utterly gripping.\n\nNovembre was released to critical acclaim in France last year \u2013 if you speak French, it is out on Blu-ray (with French subtitles to assist comprehension). It should appear in an English-language version soon, and it is certainly worth waiting for, not just for its superb performances, but also to cheer those of us who feared French cinema had had its day.\n\n**Read his piece in full:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/novembre-bataclan-paris-terrorist-attack-jean-dujardin/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/novembre-bataclan-paris-terrorist-attack-jean-dujardin/)",

There may be a journey but it\u2019s as exciting as driving on the inner state for an hour with no turns. Fallibility and the associated failure creates tension and release when finally overcome. There was none of that for Rey in the sequel. \n\nThe fan service and lazy overarching story hurt to.

Just sucks because it\u2019s awesome seeing someone embrace their character in the way he does Luke, not like Harrison who despised Solo to begin with and only agreed to come back for TFA if they killed Han off.

They had her fucking force levitate through space. They were all over the map with the new characters. Rey was just an amazing Jedi with zero training from the start because reasons.

Starts with him initially hoping to ruin things from the inside and cause dissent then eventually helping their cause by hunting down other Empire sympathizers.\n\n\n\nWhat we got was instead of \"you know how the Rebels won by defeating the Emperor and destroying the Empire?  well turns out they didn't and here's three movies that are basically the original trilogy all over again.\"",

I\u2019m not on the crazy fan train of \u201cburn Disney\u201d, but they are just dull and full of Disney playing it too safe. Disney saw dollar signs and forgot what made Star Wars so engaging for fans. We show up for a weird space opera that makes us excited for the journey. Disney gave us a full blown cookie cutter, drawn out snooze fest. \n\nThat\u2019s why they are gunning so hard on the Mandalorian. Disney struck gold and got it right.

I\u2019m a little concerned and curious about the offending topics in the story of the game which were protested and removed. \n\nI understand the ableism in the case of the man in the wheelchair who all of a sudden realized he was holding himself back and didn\u2019t need it anymore. Not so sure I understand how \u201cthe raped woman\u201d or scantly clad woman of colour needed to be removed. \n\nI\u2019m skeptical and wary of every story in art being looked at through a lens of representing a greater community and having to adhere to some guidelines of correctness. \u201cIncorrect\u201d things happen every day, why can\u2019t we tell stories about them? \n\nPersonally I would love to play a game that is offensive in its sensibilities and wouldn\u2019t see that offensiveness as an endorsement of the \u201cevil\u201d it portrays.",

The game\u2019s main story features a city full of people, including children, who get horrifically eaten by cannibals, but we can\u2019t have a scantily clad woman or acknowledge that rape is a bad thing that exists.",

In a game where people are hanging by their entrails, and we're exploding corpses the fictional rape goes too far? \n\nI mean these are the same types of people who lost their shit when Mr. Beast helped all those people with cataract blindness right? Imagine restoring the healthy and vital function of your friggin eyes being offensive. \n\nShould we stop with physical therapies or any advances in modern science that may restore vital functions necessary to a quality of life that is out of reach otherwise for fear of being offensive...to...people who think walking is overrated I guess? \n\nReminds of that old Mitch Hedburg joke where he says he never waves at a stranger for fear they could be missing a hand.",

They could be a few in dozens or hundreds that got axed.\n\nI find it interesting that replies are trying to toe the line, because they can\u2019t say such people ruined the game, because we have the game, yet some are afraid to also say they want to to see rape in their video games.\n\nBut you can bet I\u2019d the game wasn\u2019t a smashing success, they would be foaming and claiming that \u201cwoke employees\u201d would be to blame.\n\nFuckin\u2019 weirdos, man.",

The brutality of its dark fantasy includes things like rape, torture, slavery, slurs, demonic orgies, women on their periods, etc. That last one doesn't seem to fit but it does, it all comes together to make berserk incredibly original and compelling despite the wtf did I just see feeling it always leaves you with. \n\nWithout giving too much away, berserk and Diablo delve into similar territory narratively. I can understand why a giant publisher would sanitize here and there, and censorship is never self imposed so I would not call what happened hear censorship, but I wish games could be more like other art forms, and not sold as subscriptions or sports.",

She called him a baby for leaving when she got physical and mocked him by saying no one would ever believe him if he said he was a victim of domestic violence because he's a man.\n\nEDIT: a deal was made with the daily mail to release them. Here's the [first audio clip](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7947733/Amber-Heard-admits-hitting-ex-husband-Johnny-Depp-pelting-pots-pans-tape.html)\n\nAnd here's the [second](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7966723/Amber-Heard-ridicules-Johnny-Depp-claiming-hes-domestic-violence-victim.html) where she mocks him.\n\nI also recommend [Incredibly Average](https://youtu.be/aca0KWoHtqQ) on YouTube. He's covered the whole thing with all the evidence in multiple videos. The amount of witness testimonies and declarations (including [two police officers(https://theblast.com/c/johnny-depp-amber-heard-lawsuit-lapd-officers-testimony-abuse-defamation)) in defence of Johnny Depp is overwhelming at this point and are never reported on but they're out there.\n\n\nEDIT AGAIN: Woah thanks for the gold anon!",

She could have easily gone the Heard way and do it for the fame but the fact she didn't shows how much she likes Depp. And for your ex to come to his defense at a lot of risk, Depp had to be at least a decent human being. \n\nAnd JKR. If JK didn't trust Depp, he would have been out of the HP movies so fast. The fact she and even the studio trusting that decision to keep Depp spoke a lot as well. This was a time when it was a lot of risk to do that sort of a thing. Hell, Gunn lost his job for over decades old tweets.\n\nLast but not least, if people are gonna judge on Depp shouldn't they at least know a bit of info about Heard? She had pulled the same stunt before.\n\nHopefully Johnny will be able to sober up and get his life together. Amber probably used his vulnerability a lot to manipulate him. At Least the evidence points that way.\n\nAnd about that elephant in the room, I'm pretty sure we now have most of the evidence. If Amber's PI can't find anything, that means Depp is a pretty good guy.",

Everyone believed her, no one believed him, despite many of Depp's previous women stepping forward and saying the accusations was BS, and despite Heard having previous record of abusive behavior.\n\nHe lost his role in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and vocal campaigns was launched to have him removed from the Fantastic Beast movies. JK Rowlings stood by him, and faced a ton of criticism for it.\n\nHeard meanwhile became a media darling and spokesperson for abused women and women's rights.\n\nOnly when evidence against Heard surfaced, like recorded therapy sessions where she admitted to the abuse, did public opinion really start swaying against her.",

Heard has used the story of 'abuse survivor' to promote herself.\n- Now Depp is suing heard for defamation and his evidence has leaked.\n- The leaked evidence reveals that Heard was highly physically and emotionally abusive. \n\nThis is all over reddit because the story of \"*Abusive wife publicly presents husband as abuser destroys his career before he can settle it civilly in court.*\" rings redditors like a struck bell.",

While I\u2019m sure it got nasty often between them, it really really irked me how vilified he was from her statements and \u2018evidence\u2019 and cases she brought up against him immediately. It felt very familiar. To this day to the few I\u2019ve mentioned my getting beaten up for over 7 years on the reg and never putting my hands on her,  including police, I was never believed. Not once. Until I recorded her. Several times. Nobody believes the man in those situations unless it\u2019s blatantly obvious (knife sticking out of leg, dead, etc...) and female on male domestic violence is very very prevalent. There was always this \u2018well, what did you do to deserve that?\u2019 Kinda attitude about it even when I had proof, so good on Depp for going the distance to defend himself. It really gives me joy.",

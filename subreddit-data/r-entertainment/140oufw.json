There was no complete story arc (outside of Gwen and her dad). The animation and art direction was amazing. The voice acting was great. But the movie was 1.5 hours of character introductions, and then 2 massively drawn out and incredibly obvious \u201ctwists\u201d that we all knew were coming the moment Miles was scanned by the machine. This movie was 1 intro act, and then a teaser of act 2.\n\nI loved a ton of things about the movie, but the plot (or lack of complete plot) was a major detraction from the quality of the movie, imo. Obviously enjoyment of a story is subjective, but I truly can\u2019t believe that anyone would think Across the Spider-verse had even a *quarter* the story that Into the Spider-verse had.",

There is act 1 and act 2, act 1 ends pretty much when miles follows gwenn into the portal, and act 2 finishes, well, at the end of the movie.\n\nBut the story is still great, it does suck that ends as unfinished as it does, but it is a very good story, it adds so much to the story of the first movie",

I\u2019m surprised more ppl don\u2019t feel this way.\n\nI think trilogies are fine but at 2.5hrs they should have resolved at least one major plot point and left some open. Instead it felt like a very long setup for the next movie, and that left me disappointed. Of course so much of the film I loved, the animation, music, meme references, etc\u2026 but without a story resolution reward it\u2019s hard to enjoy those in a full film package.",

I\u2019m really glad they took their time to slow down and have more of those intimate character moments in this one as well. My only real critique of the original is that some of it can feel a little rushed because of the runtime but they really had the opportunity to let it breathe here and I think that\u2019ll really pay off in the third.",

I know it\u2019s weird which is why I don\u2019t tell people in real life:) Anyway, saw it last night and even if it was a silent film it would be one of the favorite things I\u2019ve ever seen. In the Gwen\u2019verse they would shoot the most subtle little fluorescent teal beam to show a mood or create a shadow. It was beautiful in a way I don\u2019t think enough people will appreciate. For me it was up there with Jurassic Park in 93, Matrix in 99, Avatar in iMax 3D (both of them) as far as just remarkable visual experiences in the theater. \n\nAnyway, I loved everything about it. I also saw it in Brooklyn and the kids here are obviously thrilled it takes place in their backyard. As a dad, I thought they wrote all of the parents as real as any movie you\u2019ll see. Real dialogue. Real things I say to my kid. There is a ton of diversity, but it\u2019s not shoved down your throat as being diverse to check off a box. The characters are real and they\u2019re cool because they\u2019re cool and confident and smart and work together. I just loved it. 10/10 for real.\n\n*edit, Matrix was 99, not 97.",

Do not get me wrong movies like Toy Story and How To Train Your Dragon 2 are groundbreaking, but more in the technology side than the style and art. While lots of Pixar movies look wonderful and creative, the charm has been somewhat lost when everything look like Pixar, and the visual charm have worn off. Its like when you play the newest triple A video game, the graphic looking great is expected and often can look obsolete after a year. Which is why I am glad that slowly more animated movies have been trying to do more of its own thing and style, trying to look good and timeless. Spiderman Across the Spiderverse is that timeless and visually gorgeous masterpiece that will still look good for years to come. Just can't praise it enough.",

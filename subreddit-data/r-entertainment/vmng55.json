The constitution is very vague on how the SCOTUS is meant to work, giving presidents a lot of leeway that they just usually don\u2019t take because it\u2019s up to Congress to confirm the nominations. So, you can appoint as many as you want, but Congress can say \u201cNo, we\u2019re sticking with 9.\u201d\n\nThis was actually a major contention under FDR; he wanted to do exactly what Stern is suggesting, even thought he had the Congressional majority to get them confirmed, but his own party basically told him to go fuck himself because they were worried that if they packed the courts it would lose them their reelection campaigns.",

The plan wasnt going to work but the court did start ruling his way but by 1941 he'd appointed most of the people on the court anyway so he didnt need to pack it. Basically people dying gave him the authority to pack the court and actually trying to pack the court kind of killed his momentum. Fdr trying to pack the court actually most likely worked against him.",

It's almost too bad the court backed down, if they hadn't he might have kept beating the war drums and maybe the court would have term limits today.\n\nThere's tons of other options if congress is behind it, like just stripping the court of their right to interpret the constitution at all.\n\nPeople are often just misled because in lower level education/casual educational programs (eg. public broadcasting, the news, etc), the relationship between congress and the supreme court is simply taught completely wrong. As if the supreme court is a \"check\" on congress that was planned out during the foundation of our country, when it's really just a legal institution that congress has *nearly* total control over, and can overrule at any moment in numerous different ways.\n\n\nAlthough the most practical option for the president is probably the whole abortions on federal land shtick, as that can be done right now with unilateral presidential authority, and nobody can overrule it.",

So that's a \"no excuse\" thing. \n\nSecond, the Hyde Amendment is about *Medicaid* dollars. Not just *any* dollars. Over the years they've inserted similar language about the ACA and other things but I see no reason why like transportation vouchers would have ANYTHING to do with Hyde. They'd probably get challenged for some other reason but not that.\n\nthird, it is not a bill in itself, it is merely a rider to the budget that has to be resubmitted and passed every year. Democrats don't need a new law to get rid of it, they need to stop passing it to get rid of it\n\nfourth [this essay](https://archive.ph/o5k0o#selection-1459.162-1493.64) specifically talks about clinics on public land. If they were leased *from* the government and the money paid *to* the government I just don't see how that breaks the Hyde amendment.",

When he left FM radio for Sirius the pay became public, so it isn\u2019t an issue anymore.  He\u2019s been making $75m+ \n/year since 2006.\n\nHe also ran on 3 issues &amp; promised to step down when they were in place: \n\n- enforce the death penalty (a volt for every vote)\n\n- use the remains of the executed to fill NYC potholes\n\n- implement nighttime road construction.  \n\nOnly one of those was a joke",

Nowadays though he no longer supports the death penalty. He ran as a Libertarian because they were willing to nominate him, but he\u2019s not really a Libertarian. He dropped out of the race when he was required to show his taxes. He claimed that he did not want to share that info but also at the time he was making surges in the polls (30% plus) and didn\u2019t really want the job. He was just doing it to push his agenda and as a radio gag. Sort of like Trump running to make national headlines and get a better deal from NBC for the Apprentice except Trump decided to actually take the job instead of bailing.",

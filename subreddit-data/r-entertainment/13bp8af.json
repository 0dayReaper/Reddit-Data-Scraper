This performance just gives her more credit there.

And both are different depending on local history.\n\nWhere I worked, everything over 8 hours kicked into time and a half. Anything over 12 hours kicked into double time and anything over midnight kicked into double time. These all stacked.\n\nSo whenever I was tight on cash, I'd sign up for a long Saturday.\n\n8 hours regular pay, 4 hours pay and a half, 2 or 3 hours at at quadruple pay (past 12 hours, past midnight.)\n\nOn a 15 hour shift (where I was more on standby to work than I was working) I'd get 27 hours of pay. Most of that day was spent shooting the shit with other crew members, playing cardgames in the loading bay, eating the free catering, and listening to live music. In total, about 3 hours at the start and 3 hours at the end involved the real labor.\n\nAs a young 20 something barely scraping by, weekends like that were awesome. Three free meals, left overs, live music, and a spare 550 (more based on experience) bucks for 6 hours of actual work was a good way to spend a Saturday.",

I have helped out on small sound gigs and if rain was on the way, we had to rush out and throw tarps or plastic over all the gear. How can a show this big continue with working lights, smoke, sound, etc.? Is the gear just waterproof or waterproofed in some way? Or does a bunch of gear just get ruined in service of a great show? I've always wondered.",

It sounds great, but it's indicative of poor technique. When the breath is supported by abdominal muscles in the right way and the vocal cords are relaxed they actually do not get hurt by this much singing, but you really have to do it right. She does it right.",

Additionally, during other tours she apparently would not talk between concerts, so I imagine she\u2019s implementing that to some extent as well.",

There are many examples of singers who utilize their sound equipment and mixing, and also have great breath and vocal support to sing softer than it seems without wavering or being too \"breathy\", and maintaining clear annunciation. All of which substantially reduces vocal strain. \n\nOften, singers who damage their vocal chords don't have particularly great technique, and are constantly straining because they're compensating by singing with their \"head voice\" when it should be chest. It doesn't mean they're not good singers, obviously they are, but they tend to rely more on their *talent* than on their *skill* (as in relying their inherent ability to sing well v.s. using acquired skills from professional training and practice).",

There are people who use their natural voice to sing, and for those people, singing is a lot like talking in terms of vocal strain. A wonderful example is Dolly Parton. If you listen to an interview of her (I recall one specifically with Colbert), occasionally she will just sorta flow into singing a lick.\n\nOn the flip side, someone like Mariah Carey clearly is using a specific \"head voice\" to sing. It sounds nothing like how she speaks, yet it is still quite beautiful. This limits how long she can sing and makes it much easier for her to be in the wrong position/mood/rest level/health level to sing a peak performance (because so many things in her vocal system have to be in the right condition). On the flip side, it likely gives her a wider frequency range and she's probably capable of singing more styles in general.",

BUT if you were lucky enough to get a ticket during the presale, the ticket prices ranged from like $69 for the nosebleeds. I got one hundreds level seats in the center for $250, and floor seats for $425 \u2014 my friend got first row floor seats on the catwalk (so like the very best) for $700.",

Same thing happened, it started pouring buckets. I mean like really fucking raining, in the middle of her show.\n\nShe pretty much announced over the speakers while she was back stage something along the lines of \"If you stay, i'm staying\" and it rained for like 2 hours.\n\nWhen it finally stopped, she just came back out and picked up right where she left off. We were there until probably about 2 am or so.",

Just so cool. \n\nUnabashedly a huge fan of Swift and this just reinforces my opinion. \n\nI honestly think she doesn\u2019t get enough credit as a songwriter. She\u2019s released 10(!) studio albums that are all commercially successful, with 3-4 of them being huge critical successes as well. \n\nPeople love to compare her to other pop stars but frankly, she should be on a list with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, Neil Young and Carole King, not Madonna/Britney Spears and the like.",

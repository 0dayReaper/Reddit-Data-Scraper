I don't know how much of that Nic Cage movie is real, but a lot of it meshed with what I've read about him previously. The guy is a major film buff and puts a lot of effort into his roles. In movies where he's there for the check the big difference is he gets really creative with it.",

Here it was greed or  an \"appetite for risk.\" Madoff offered the prospect of unrealistically large and consistent returns with no  reasonable explanation of his methods, and a stunning lack of fees for this incredible performance. There was a notable lack of interest in asking questions and an over reliance on compelling narratives and social and work connections. Madoff intentionally kept his methods opaque, and for more than would ever admit to it, it was a situation of \"I'm not asking and I don't want to know, just keep the returns coming.\" Many larger investors ignored the advice of their financial advisors, like the owners of the NY Mets.   \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s obvious life lessons there. You know, if something is too good to be true, it\u2019s too good to be true.\u201d  Kevin Bacon. Most of us learn that lesson fairly early in life. And anyone who puts their entire life savings in a single investment, well....  \n\n&gt;\"There's no Duke Endowment [among the list of Madoff investors],\" Hedges says. \"There's no Harvard management, there's no Yale, there's no Penn, there's no Weyerhauser, no State of Texas or Virginia Retirement system.\"\n\n&gt;The reason is simple, in Hedges' view. Letting Madoff manage your money \"wouldn't pass an institutional-quality due diligence process,\" he says. \"Because when you get to page two of your 30-page due diligence questionnaire, you've already tripped eight alarms and said 'I'm out of here.'\"  \n\n&amp;nbsp;   \n\n\n&gt;But Madoff's investors rave about his performance -- even though they don't understand how he does it. \"Even knowledgeable people can't really tell you what he's doing,\" one very satisfied investor told Barron's. \"People who have all the trade confirmations and statements still can't define it very well. The only thing I know is that he's often in cash\" when volatility levels get extreme. This investor declined to be quoted by name. Why? Because Madoff politely requests that his investors not reveal that he runs their money. \n\n&gt;\"What Madoff told us was, 'If you invest with me, you must never tell anyone that you're invested with me. It's no one's business what goes on here,'\"  [Barrons, **2001**]\n\n&gt;Curiously, he charges no fees for his money-management services. Nor does he take a cut of the 1.5% fees marketers like Fairfield Greenwich charge investors each year. Why not? \"We're perfectly happy to just earn commissions on the trades,\" he says.\n\n&gt;Perhaps so. But consider the sheer scope of the money Madoff would appear to be leaving on the table. A typical hedge fund charges 1% of assets annually, plus 20% of profits. On a $6 billion fund generating 15% annual returns, that adds up to $240 million a year. [Barrons, **2001**]\n\n\nAnd in this case investors have had 88% of their initial investments returned to them. The huge losses that some celebs have been claiming they suffered were mostly the phantom profits Madoff said they had made.",

A rival hedge fund was upset that Madoff was outperforming him, and assigned a financial expert to research how Madoff is able to be so successful. After brief calculations the expert concluded that Madoff\u2019s level of success was indeed impossible to match, and he must be fudging the numbers or committing fraud. Upon learning of this, the hedge fund owner scoffed and fired the expert, and hired a new one to figure out how he could  match Madoff\u2019s returns. The expert went on to warn the SEC continuously, providing them with extensive evidence proving that Madoff was running a pyramid scheme. They also ignored him. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Markopolos",

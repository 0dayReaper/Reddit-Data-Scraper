Some were struggling even after the first. \n\nIt's amazing that Netflix cancels shows that get it right from the very start and show promise of getting even better with time. It's sad that these shows don't get their chance to grow and more so now because audiences won't give them a chance due to these practices.",

You take into consideration all of the movies, animated movies, licensed animation projects, live action series, documentary movies, documentary series, stand up comedy specials, etc. etc. They are spending a MASSIVE fortune.\n\nThat is the storm that causes the accountants to lose their hair and demand for cost cutting, so Netflix is going to cut everything that doesn't perform immediately because they need to free up cash flow for next season's massive slate of content they greenlit. They don't leave themselves any wiggle room to \"wait and see\" how a show does long term because they have far too much stuff in the pipeline that needs funding and staffing.\n\nIt's not sustainable at all. \n\nWhat Netflix needs to do is to look at what HBO does. Yea they make a lot of content too, but it's nowhere near as crazy in terms of volume as what Netflix is trying to do.",

It really feels like they're just pumping out as much as they can hoping 1 out of every 20 shows will be a mega viral hit and that offsets the other 19 shows they forget about.",

This is really bad for a steaming service because just because people are watching it, doesn't mean they are subscribed for that show. They have their accountants measure how much royalties they are paying every year vs how much revenue they will lose from subscribers cancelling it, and estimated the royalties were higher.  New streaming shows are more likely to have flat payments for everyone and not give any royalties or have the royalties expire after a year, so they can avoid this problem\n\nEdit: I might have residuals and royalties confused",

People were busy with family, and when they were watching TV, they were watching Christmas movies with family instead. As soon as I started watching it, they announced it was cancelled. And I started watching it not long after getting home, I think it was still during winter break. Ridiculous expectations for working adults. Or is Netflix not catering to the people who pay the bills?",

Which we would be totally fine with.  Do all the limited series and short series you want. 1 and dones. Great then we know we arent wasting our time without knowing if we are getting an ending. So much of time could spent on watching so many other things that aren't cancelled. Unacceptable.",

It\u2019s obnoxious that showrunners seem to plan for 3-6+ seasons to tell their convoluted story knowing it\u2019s statistically unlikely to make it past 1-2 seasons. Tighten it up.",

S1 was excellent and compelling, the world's lore was perfect for telling a wide variety of interesting stories, and then S2 just... cratered.  I can't even describe why it was suddenly unwatchable, but after 2-3 episodes I just had no desire to put on the next one.\n\nThe only other show I can remember with the same abrupt nosedive was Heroes, and the writers' strike can be blamed for that one.",

They want another Stranger Things - a smash-hit show that everyone loves and talks about and that they can spin into endless merchandising.\n\nCan\u2019t have that with neatly tied-off season arcs.",

Makes no sense if a streamer needs viewers to watch content immediately and finish it immediately in order to preserve the series - the whole selling point of streaming was watch the content you want, when you want. Netflix feels like it's in a doom spiral.",

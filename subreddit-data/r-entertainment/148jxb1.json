            "comment": "Disney and Pixar have unveiled the first teaser for\u00a0Elio, the 28th animated feature from Pixar Animation, at the same time announcing that Jameela Jamil (Poker Face) and Brad Garrett (High Desert) have joined its voice cast.\n\nThe actors join an ensemble led by up-and-comer Yonas Kibreab that also includes America Ferrera, as previously announced.\n\nDirected by Adrian Molina, the co-director and writer of Pixar\u2019s\u00a0Coco,\u00a0Elio\u00a0introduces viewers to Kibreab\u2019s character of the same name. An underdog with an active imagination, Elio finds himself inadvertently beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide. Mistakenly identified as Earth\u2019s ambassador to the rest of the universe, and completely unprepared for that kind of pressure, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, survive a series of formidable trials and somehow discover who he is truly meant to be.\u00a0\n\nFerrera voices Elio\u2019s mom, Olga, with Jamil as Ambassador Questa and Garrett as Ambassador Grigon.\n\nThe film produced by Mary Alice Drumm, who associate produced\u00a0Coco, is set for release in theaters on March 1, 2024 and will contend on its opening weekend with Universal Pictures\u2019 stuntman actioner\u00a0The Fall Guy\u00a0starring Ryan Gosling, coming out just a couple of weeks after Columbia Pictures\u2019\u00a0Madame Web\u00a0starring Sydney Sweeney and Dakota Johnson.\n\nBoth\u00a0Elio\u00a0and the Peter Sohn-directed\u00a0Elemental, which hits theaters June 16th after a Cannes bow, come at a time when Disney and Pixar are looking to rebound on the animation side. While Pixar had a hit last year in Domee Shi\u2019s Oscar-nominated\u00a0Turning Red, other recent titles from the studios like Pixar\u2019s\u00a0Lightyear\u00a0and Disney\u2019s\u00a0Strange World\u00a0have hit on more mixed reviews.\n\nBest known for turns on series like\u00a0The Good Place\u00a0and in films like\u00a0Marry Me, Jamil has most recently been seen on Peacock\u2019s\u00a0Poker Face, the hit murder mystery series from Rian Johnson which has been renewed for a second season. She is represented by UTA, 3 Arts Entertainment and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.\n\nThree-time Emmy winner Garrett can currently be seen on Apple\u2019s comedy series\u00a0High Desert, having also been seen of late on Peacock\u2019s\u00a0Bupkis\u00a0as well as in Cooper Raiff\u2019s acclaimed Apple indie\u00a0Cha Cha Real Smooth. He is repped by UTA, Entertainment 360 and Gendler &amp; Kelly.",

He has a soothing baritone voice that lends itself to animation. But casting him as (what I'm just going to assume is) the skeptical but loving dad is too lazy.",

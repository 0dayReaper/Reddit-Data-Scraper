            "comment": "The first reactions are in for \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,\u201d with critics and journalists saying the film is \u201can actual work of art\u201d while also \u201cdarker and sadder\u201d than expected.\n\nThe long-awaited sequel to 2018\u2019s highly successful animated adventure \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d \u201cAcross the Spider-Verse\u201d picks up over a year after the events of the first film. Miles Morales/ Spider-Man (Shameik Moore) is approached by Gwen Stacy/ Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld) to help her complete a mission that will save every universe from supervillain the Spot (Jason Schwartzman). Together, Miles and Gwen travel through the Multiverse, where they encounter the Spider-Society, led by Miguel O\u2019Hara (Oscar Isaac).\n\nCinemaBlend managing editor Sean O\u2019Connell wrote on Twitter that the film \u201clives one step above Masterpiece. It\u2019s an actual work of art. Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect.\u201d\n\nTHR writer Brian Davids teased that \u201cAcross the Spider-Verse\u201d is \u201cdarker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.\u201d Davids also praised Steinfeld\u2019s performance as Gwen, saying she \u201creally comes into her own.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rotten Tomatoes writer Tessa Smith said \u201cAcross the Spider-Verse\u201d \u201craises its own bar which seemed impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are shocking twists, unexpected surprises and a story that truly makes sense for the crazy multiverse world that we have all jumped head first in to,\u201d Smith continued.",

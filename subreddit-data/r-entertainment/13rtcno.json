Olivia Hussey had defended the role less than five years ago:\n\n&gt;In a August 2018 interview with Stephanie Nolasco for [Fox News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News) to promote the release of her autobiography *Girl on the Balcony*,  Hussey discussed how she felt at ease on the set when filming the nude  scene: \"We shot it at the end of the film. So by that time...we've  become one big family. It wasn't that big of a deal. And Leonard wasn't  shy at all! In the middle of shooting I just completely forgot I didn't  have clothes on.\"[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Hussey#cite_note-18)[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Hussey#cite_note-19) \n\n&gt;In another 2018 interview with [*Variety*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)),  Hussey defended the nude scene, saying, \"Nobody my age had done that  before,\" she said, adding that Zeffirelli shot it tastefully. \"It was  needed for the film. Everyone thinks they were so young they didn't  realize what they were doing. But we were very aware. We both came from  drama schools and when you work you take your work very seriously.\"[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Hussey#cite_note-20)[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Hussey#cite_note-21)\n\nHard to sue after saying all that. Plus the director they were blaming in the suit is dead.",

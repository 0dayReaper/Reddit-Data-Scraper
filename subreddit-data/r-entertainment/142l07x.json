            "comment": "I don't think people realize just how queerphobic LA is.\n\nSome things that have happened to me while in LA:\n\n1. My husband and I were sat in a private room for a Valentine's day dinner, despite not requesting (or paying) for that. (Similar things happened a lot when we went to dinner - like being seated away from other customers or such)\n2. I was waiting to get my haircut in the barber shop from my barber that I had for years. My barber's client started talking about how queer folk are all pedophiles and that they should be rounded up and killed. My barber laughed and agreed with him.\n3. Had trash thrown out of a bus at my head while the passenger yelled \"F\\*GG\\*T!\"\n4. Was told at a public pool that my husband's and my marriage wasn't \"real\" and that just because we have a document saying we are married, doesn't mean we are.\n5. My husband and I *never* showed PDA outside of specific queer enclaves to ensure our own safety.\n6. We were refused a hotel room when they discovered we were a gay couple.\n\nNow, I have never been physically attacked (other than the trash) in LA like I have in other areas. So, though it is clearly not the best, it is definitely better than a whole hell of a lot of other places.",

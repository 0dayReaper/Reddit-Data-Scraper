It's got something for everyone.\n\nLike sports? Detroit has 4 sports teams all within a block of each other. UofM is a short drive, too.\n\nLike food? We got some amazing restaurants and the best Middle Eastern food outside of the Middle East.\n\nLike culture/music? Motown defined generations of music and its roots can still be seen regularly in today's music. Also, tons of musicians play here when they go on tour.\n\nLike art? We got the DIA, one of the greatest art museums in the US. \n\nThis is all just off the top of my head. I'm sure there's so much more that I'm forgetting.",

Both Jack &amp; Meg probably didn't want to deal with the senseless pearl-clutching and the following questions being asked ***ad nauseum***:\n\n\u2022 \"*Isn't it ***weird*** playing music with your married ex?*\"\n\n\u2022 \"*Is there still any sexual tension?*\"\n\n\u2022 \"*Do you still fight like a married couple?*\"\n\n\u2022 \"*Do the people you each date resent this?*\"\n\nETC.\n\nThe White Stripes (smartly) did not want to have to deal with any sort of intrusive questions and JUST focus on their (great) music.\n\nYou have to bear in mind they formed that band over ***twenty years ago***.  Back then, the concept of two exes having an **amicable breakup** was a lot more foreign to people.\n\nSadly, people expected breakups - particularly among MARRIED exes - to be messy, vitriolic and unpleasant.  This was well before people legitimately understood 'conscious uncoupling'.\n\nHell, I mean on \"The X-Files\" (no pun intended) people *really* debated whether the male and female leads could actually be platonic friends\u00b9.\n\n\n\nAnd let's face it - journalism was incredibly more intrusive\u00b2 back then with regards to boundaries.\n\n\u00b9(and we see how **that** turned out.)\n\n\u00b2(we had journalists feeling completely entitled to actually ask music and movie stars about their virginity status and/or if they were LGBTQ+ for fucks sake.)",

That there would be no White Stripes without her setting the tempo.\n\nFast forward to recent times, within the last ten years, Jack was already solo and was selling some remastered music by pioneering artists that had inspired his career on vinyl that he was trying to preserve in a swanky box set (not cheap), and he was on Charlie Rose. When Rose asked him about his solo career and what it felt like to be a solo artist in the present day, Jack said \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019ve always been a solo artist\u2026\u201d\n\nSomething about that *really* rubbed me the wrong way. I felt like it was a kind of red flag, that the man\u2019s ego had gotten the better of him. Still one of the best guitarists of his generation, though.",

She\u2019s definitely one of the most amateur drummers to ever play in a successful band. But he said that about her ages ago, I think even before Seven Nation Army gave them the massive wave of recognition. I know Jack is kind of an asshole at his core, in some respects, but you\u2019re basically saying he was just blowing smoke up her ass when he had no real reason to do so at the time.\n\nI\u2019m just saying, The White Stripes was a duo; it was a two piece band (not including the other stuff Jack threw into the mix). For him to say what he said in the Charlie Rose interview is basically ignoring the history of his success. It\u2019s treating the duality of The White Stripes as a write-off. It diminishes her role to nothingness.",

They are not going to grow up to be adults. They never really got a chance to live. So the one thing they want before they pass on\u2026 is to see *you*.\n\nYou walk in to the hospital, their parents are there. You all know what you\u2019re there for. And just for a moment, you make this child, who never really had a chance, the happiest child on earth. Their parents are beaming despite the intense grief just below the surface.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine it being easy to do these. I wouldn\u2019t be able to just show up, shake a kid\u2019s hand, get my little photo op and be on my way. It has to take a toll on a person to do them, despite however rewarding it could potentially be. To do over 650 of them? That\u2019s legend status. That\u2019s 650 dying children. At least that many grieving parents/friends/family members. That\u2019s a lot of pain and suffering to put oneself adjacent to, and for nothing but appreciation in return.\n\nJohn Cena is a saint.",

Which is not how books work, at all.  \n\nOr the number of times Bruce Willis told the studio he was going to get his way or they could figure out who their second choice was, *while the file was shooting*.\n\nI suppose the difference was those movies used to cost 50-70 million, in the hopes of grossing 200.  Now they cost 350 million and hope to get to a billion.  Stakes are much higher.",

During this time martial arts films were highly choreographed violent ballet with long sequences of traps and counters. Bruce Lee got the nick name \"Bruce 3 kicks\". His justification was it was more realistic as nobody could take 3 of his strikes in real life. Not egregious but still partly because of his image.\n\nStallone had the main rival of Over the Top changed early in casting and switched out with a much meaner, somewhat bigger looking guy because it made him look better in comparison, even though the original guy was an actual arm wrestling champion.\n\nAccording to rumor Arnold prevented himself from being shown getting beat up on screen in Batman and Robin. Which is odd for a Batman property since half of what he does is martial arts. That's why you have cuts where Batman gets close to Freeze and the next cut has Freeze in restraints.\n\nJCVD apparently threw a hissy fit over Manu Bennett as his rival on screen as Manu's muscles outshone his, I can't remember if the film was cancelled outright or the role was recast. Manu talks candidly about it as he got really jacked for the role by taking steroids for the first time.\n\nSteven Seagal is famously a douche who does this all the time. He never gets hurt, bleeds and is basically super naturally good at everything on screen.\n\nPersonally, I think it's fairly understandable for action stars to do it. It's their \"brand\" and helps to sell the super macho figure that they're trying to promote.",

If the Rock or any of those stars gets offered a role or goes after a role they and their team will negotiate with the studio about the role.\n\nThe \"brand\" is unbeatable, invincible superman. Losing fights harms that brand. Action movie stars are very similar to pro wrestlers, probably why the Rocks been so successful.",

Right, it\u2019s not in writing that these guys \u201ccan\u2019t lose.\u201d  They negotiate it. Lots of scripts have rewrites, etc. Also, keep in mind that SO MANY of these screenplays are always rewritten for multiple reasons. Sometimes the producers want a clearer story, good vs bad, etc. It\u2019s not always the actors. Also, some of these guys are bigger sports than others and aren\u2019t afraid to make themselves look foolish too. The Rock played a bad moronic doofus in Pain &amp; Gain and he also played a total idiot in The Other Guys. \n\nAny of these actors would either play the bad guy who loses OR a good guy who fails in the right movie. If Scorsese is looking for an action guy who has to lose, they\u2019ll compete for it.",

And his characters can't be badly injured.

Arnold showed he was outclassed in Predator and T2 (not to mention being a villain in T1).  I don't remember much many van damme films but I don't recall him ever being as stoic, invincible, and most bored as the rock is in every movie.  And if you look at other popular action adventure stars then you'll see similar trends. Bruce Willis practically created the every man action hero archetype. Harrison Ford is almost never in control in Star Wars or Indiana Jones.\n\nThe problem with the rock is that his good portrayals are extremely repetitive. Stoic guy in jungle who punches dozens of guys without a sweat. And the sad part is he'd probably be way more liked if he went in the opposite direction.  Imagine how refreshing it would be if he was in a movie against a villain who physically outclasses him ala Predator. Or a film where he's just a straight up menacing villain (and not just a bland anti-hero or whatever Black Adam was supposed to be). Hell, his wrestling career didn't even take off until he became a heel. That charisma would do wonders for him if he switched it up.",

Superman has his own villains, Black Adam has Shazam, trying to shoehorn their rivalry because he's \"bigger than his character\" was pure arrogance. Here's how he should have done it: \n\n1. Push for an amazing Shazam 2 and present an amazing character\n\n2. Upgrade to Superman with a Shazam collab where they team up against Black Adam.\n\nThat's how you get your Supeman v Black Adam. Especially since, let's be honest, Black Adam isn't well known. Work it a-la-Loki style. It might still not work because Superman's villains are more prominent than the ones for any Avengers member's, but still a better plan than the one he had",

For context, both Rock and Cena originally became stars in the world of pro wrestling before moving to Hollywood.\n\n Cena, who was still an active wrestler at the time, repeatedly bashed Rock for \"leaving\", as Rock was making movies full time and was not wrestling at the time. Rock defended himself by saying there were other reasons why he could not come back and wrestle, not his lack of desire. \n\nAt the time, Cena scoffed, but he has now come to realize that being a top star in Hollywood means you have a lot riding on you, and you can't just take risks like wrestling (with the potential for very serious injury) whenever you want. There are lots of people involved in the timely production of a film that are depending on you. He has since apologized repeatedly for his lack of understanding at the time.\n\nRock did actually come back to pro wrestling a number of years ago (he has since been back multiple times) and he suffered a serious injury which set back the production of a film by several months.",

Later, before making Walking Tall and feeling the same after returning, The Rock was displeased with creative - so he let his contract end and went full time into the movies.  \n\n\nThis is a cycle, lol.",

WWE tried to work around it from 2001-04 where Rock would disappear completely from programming for a movie, come back, wrestle big programs for a few months then disappear again.\n\nIt was really chaotic because WWE would have full-blown programs for their full-time talent then backburner it for Rocky.  It fucked-up their schedule plus as you mentioned there was the risk of Rock getting injured and fucking up Hollywood's schedule.\n\nNot to mention Rock missing out on roles because of his commitment for a WWE pay-per-view.\n\nIt showed that even if a wrestler stayed loyal and worked for WWE it just wasn't possible with Hollywood's demands.  So if you go to Hollywood as a wrestler...you're basically gone from WWE.",

Meltzer said that Rock is above doing podcasts unless for rare occasions. And that Rock does the big media tour for his movies and goes back into the cocoon for the next one. \n\nThere isnt any possible way Rock can spare 2-3 hours for a signing? Or does it hurt the branding?\n\nCena has done tons of conventions.",

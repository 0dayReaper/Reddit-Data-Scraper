We didn\u2019t have very favorable reviews,\u201d Holland said. \u201cSo the press story was that I have taken this year off because of the reviews. But I\u2019m eight months into my year off. I\u2019ve been chilling at home in London, going to Grand Prixes, playing golf\u2026\u201d\n\n&gt;Holland doubled down on the negative \u201cCrowded Room\u201d reviews by praising his supporters. \u201cI would like to say a massive thank you to my fans, and the people that have seen the show because we\u2019re at 94% on Rotten Tomatoes,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel so grateful that I have a wonderful community of people that support me and are there for me, so I\u2019m honored and really excited for the rest of the show to come out.\u201d",

It looks pretty dull. But then again, that seems to be the theme with AppleTV+... Is it just me, or does browsing that place feel like a spoof of a streaming service in a video game/movie?",

Worked out for him great. It is apparent from watching the Crowded Room show that it was suitable to be a film. Some stories don't need stretching.",

Around the time of the 3rd film he was saying if he was still playing Spider-Man when he was 30 something was wrong, but now he's back to talking about loving to playing Spider-Man and he's 27.  He definitely realizes that Spider-Man is something that can keep his career alive since his other projects  haven't quite been as well received.",

So they were trying to diversify him as quickly as possible to show he had range before that happened. \n\nSo even if the movie was good or bad, hit or flop, as long as he was good, they got what they wanted. Now that he has shown that, he probably will be more choosey.",

Ive played and loved every installment of the games and the castings of Holland and Wahlberg just turned me completely off. I mean, I didnt even bother watching the trailers.

My only complaint was a couple of \u201ctoo ridiculous\u201d moments, and now I think Tom and Mark could age into the roles quite nicely over the next 15 or so years, if they make sequels.",

Reboot where the man cast Jack Harlow was given the role because he has enough followers to promote the film and a guaranty a few million will see the film. \n\nPeople acted like him reading one paragraph and getting the role must mean he is some top notch actor. And other actors have talked about missing out on roles due to social media stars being casted.",

Instead of star power, they wanted to have control, so IP\u2019s were pushed more so than stars. Marvel, DC, Jurassic Park, video game moves, all of that is owned properties by the conglomerates. People used to see movies for the stars, now they go to see their favorite character/ IP, no matter who is cast. It gives management more leverage during negotiations",

Sometimes you just want to spend 2 hours hanging out with an exceptionally charismatic individual.\n\nIf you take Top Gun: Maverick or any Indiana Jones movie, and swap out the leads with Chris Hemsworth, they\u2019re nowhere near as fun.\n\nMovie studios think that franchises are the stars now, and that you can interchange all the parts. I don\u2019t think this has proven true.\n\nHowever, other times you\u2019re there for the property. Other times you\u2019re there because the movie and story look interesting. Those are fine, too.",

Actors aren\u2019t burned into the minds like they once were, and they don\u2019t have this larger-than-life image any longer.\u201d \n\nIn my opinion that's a good thing. This whole article is basically complaining about how we're running out of stars that are bigger than the movies their in. It fails to take into consideration that movies have gotten better, actors have gotten better, and overall there's just more competition. Back in the 70s and 80s we maybe got 1 or 2 blockbusters a year and the rest of the year was filled with subpar acting and story telling. It was easy for Harrison Ford and Arnold Schwarzenegger to become the focal point when their movies were the biggest thing that year and had no competition.",

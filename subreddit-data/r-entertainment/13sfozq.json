Amazon had no comment.\n\nNorthern Ireland Screen said: \u201cNorthern Ireland Screen is extremely disappointed that Blade Runner 2099 is not going ahead at this time due to the ongoing writers\u2019 strike.\n\n\u201cThe project has been prepping on the ground in Belfast for many months now. The\u00a0WGA\u00a0strike has been halting production all over the world and we hope a fair deal is reached soon so crew can get back to work.\u201d\n\nAmazon Prime Video took\u00a0Blade Runner 2099\u00a0to series last September after\u00a0Deadline revealed in February\u00a0that it was in priority development at Amazon Studios.\n\nRidley Scott, who directed the original 1982\u00a0Blade Runner\u00a0movie, is executive producing the series, set 50 years after the\u00a0Blade Runner\u00a0movie sequel,\u00a0Blade Runner 2049, which was released in 2017 and was directed by Denis Villeneuve.\n\nSilka Luisa, showrunner of Apple TV+\u2019s\u00a0Shining Girls, is writing and executive producing\u00a0Blade Runner 2099, which comes from Alcon Entertainment in association with Scott Free Productions and Amazon Studios.\n\nThe 1982\u00a0Blade Runner, an adaptation of Philip K. Dick\u2019s novel\u00a0Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, is set in a dystopian LA in 2019, in which synthetic humans known as replicants are bio-engineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on space colonies. When a fugitive group of advanced replicants escape back to Earth, a cop reluctantly agrees to hunt them down. Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young and Edward James Olmos starred.\n\nThe 2017 sequel, which is set in 2049, starred Ryan Gosling as a replicant blade runner, who uncovers a secret that threatens to destabilize society. Ford and Olmos reprised their roles from the original and it also featured Ana de Armas, Dave Bautista, and Jared Leto.",

IIRC The Princess and the Frog was Disney\u2019s way to test the market for something like that and it made a fraction of what their CG animation stuff was doing. Public perception started to move towards \u201ccel animated = straight to DVD quality\u201d film.  \nEDIT: I get it, it\u2019s cel animated, not cell",

Home on the range, brother bear, Atlantis.. they're not terrible, but they don't have the same feel that 88-92 had. The characters never landed in the cultural consciousness, no well known songs.. they were instantly forgettable.\n\nI hate that they stopped making 2D because of public perception shifting, when they weren't exactly putting out great 2D stories at the time",

Traditional animation, where each frame is drawn by hand, was the main method used until digital animation arrived. Unlike the traditional method, modern 2D animation is all about computers and their ability to take things further when it comes to creating an animation. Traditional cel animation died out in the mid 2000s with the Cartoon Network show Ed, Edd n Eddy being the last major animated production to use cel. With the Last traditional cel animated movie being Bill Plympton's Hair High.",

Then again, if the whole movie looks like that even in HDR, get the pitchforks out.",

It was pretty decent - hard to beat the OG voice talent of songs stuck in your head for 30+ years, but still good.\n\nThey expanded a few things, threw in a few small scenes. I think if it were ~25 minutes shorter it would be great for kids. My kids were getting antsy in the theater due to the longer runtime plus all the previews (yes I should know better about preview length).\n\nMy biggest gripe? No \"Chefs Song\". Just as bad as taking out \"Be Prepared\" in Lion King.",

Now I do enjoy most of the Disney misfit films, they're something outside of the Disney norm and still have that passion in their productions.\n\nThat being said some are a bit messy and had stories tightened up a bit before they went into full animation production. But it's also partially on Exec Disney probably not giving these productions the proper time because they're not princess fare. Hell they just did it again with Strange World which should have gotten the typical Mouse marketing but just came and went with little fanfare.\n\nI'd love to see a live action Atlantis or Treasure Planet, a Black Cauldron that actually follows the book. These films and actually a lot of bad movies have good ideas, but had poor directors, actors, scripts and should be given another shot. But and this is a general Hollywood thing not just Disney they're banking on nostalgia of something that new and successful instead of risking on something that was bad and could become good.",

Usually for big movies, international box office is about 2 times the domestic but for TLM it's about 30% lower than US/Canada. With a near 250 million budget and 100 million in marketing it needs to do about 625 million to break even, without some miracle legs it won't reach that.",

Of all the live action Disney remakes I\u2019d say this is either best or second best (with Aladdin being the top). The animals were realistic but they didn\u2019t get stuck in the hyper realism that Lion King did. They still let the animals be animated and have \u201chuman\u201d characteristics (except maybe for Flounder, but even he grew on me). All-in-all I was just so happy to see my daughters so excited the whole time. Only problem is they keep asking to go back!",

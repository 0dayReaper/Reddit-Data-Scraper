            "comment": "&gt; As a star-studded farewell to the Zack Snyder era of the DC franchise, The Flash cost over $200 million to make. This likely explains why Warner Bros. is pushing for a big theatrical release, hoping the film will be a financial hit despite Ezra Miller\u2019s widely-publicized arrests and abuse allegations, including assault and burglary charges, and reports of messianic delusions and exposing children to dangerous firearms.\n\n\n&gt; Overlapping with tacit attempts to rehabilitate Miller\u2019s image, The Flash\u2018s publicity machine is marketing the film as\u2014in the words of DC franchise boss James Gunn\u2014\u201done of the greatest superhero movies ever made.\u201d It\u2019s a bold claim, promoting the idea that The Flash is so groundbreaking and essential that Miller\u2019s scandals are irrelevant.\n\n\n&gt; This strategy hinges on promoting reactions from private screenings before critics or mainstream audiences have seen the movie, resulting in media coverage of stuff like Warner Bros.\u2019 controversial CEO David Zaslav saying \u201cit\u2019s the best superhero movie I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d (Well, he would say that.)\n\n\n&gt; But while private screenings and hype from studio bosses are a normal part of the process, most films don\u2019t warrant headlines about Tom Cruise loving the film so much he cold-called the director to rave about it. And since a lot of people still see The Flash as a toxic product, they find it kind of weird to see unrelated celebrities go to bat for this movie in particular. When Stephen King tweeted praise for it last night, he was met by a deluge of jokes about being a paid shill.",

It went through at least 2 - 3 page one rewrites and screenwriter changes, director changes *after* production had started, cameos that came and went and came again, and THEN, after Ezra embarked on his crime spree, they re-did it some more, and then they re-did even more to adapt to the changing shared universe plans, all after principle photography had ended. Then you add in the cost of all the small and large roles by major actors like Keaton and Michael Shannon, who were not under existing contract.\n\nWB will never reveal the true production cost of this film if they can help it, but I suspect is is well north of $330M, not including marketing costs.",

That\u2019s not just a matter of bringing in a new actor though they would need to rebuild any sets, bring back the entire crew, pay a-list actors like Keaton and Affleck to come back for their scenes, redo the entire marketing campaign for a new actor and so much more.\n\nYou would be talking about another year or more in production and hundreds of millions of dollars on a movie that is already **way** behind schedule and over budget. It\u2019s easier for them to just try market it as much as they can and see if they can make back their money.",

Majors has people who knew him years ago in college coming out to be like \"Yeah he always was a total bully.\" It seems like Majors is just an abusive dick while Miller's abusive behaviour is fueled by legitimate severe mental illness. Not that that justifies enabling them but it is more forgivable or at least understandable to most people.\n\nEither way I hope Marvel doesn't pull this. We don't need another circus like this. BUT if Marvel fires Majors shouldn't they also fire the man playing Kamala Kahns father who has multiple sexual harassment complaints? But he's already in The Marvels and they're clearly not scrapping him from that.",

I honestly just hope regardless of whatever happens Miller's family gets them medicated and in treatment, this is the kind of thing that will take years to begin recovering from. It's insane how public this all was while they were falling apart and attacking people but now that they're supposedly in treatment it's just mum.

But, I wanna go and watch a good superhero movie to start my summer! If the WOM is strong for this it will do really well and better than what people expect. \n\n\nAlso I don\u2019t get why everyone is pissed that Batgirl was scrapped, it looked like trash",

Even if Batgirl was going to be hot garbage there's still the valid question of why it got cancelled when it was already basically done while the nostalgia jerk off fest starring a problematic actor goes forward.",

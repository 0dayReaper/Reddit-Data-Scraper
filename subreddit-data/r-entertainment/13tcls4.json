            "comment": "&gt; **His statement followed on the heels of Berlin police telling news media that they had opened an investigation into Waters\u2019 behavior and imagery at his arena concerts in Berlin.** Waters did not directly refer to the news of the German police investigation in his post.\n\n\n&gt; **\u201cThe elements of my performance that have been questioned are quite clearly a statement in opposition to fascism, injustice and bigotry in all its forms,\u201d Waters wrote on Facebook.** \u201cAttempts to portray those elements as something else are disingenuous and politically motivated. **The depiction of an unhinged fascist demagogue has been a feature of my shows since Pink Floyd\u2019s \u2018The Wall\u2019 in 1980.\u201d**\n\n\n&gt; A police spokesman in Berlin said Waters was being investigated on the **\u201csuspicion of incitement to public hatred because the clothing worn on stage could be used to glorify or justify Nazi rule.\u201d It is illegal in Germany to display Nazi symbolism, justify the Holocaust or commit antisemitic acts. Reports that Waters wears a replica SS uniform as part of his show are incorrect, as the costuming is similar but parodic in nature,** however disturbing or inappropriate his pantomiming firing a machine gun at the audience may be.",

I\u2019m not really interested in defending Roger Waters, the person, and if you want to criticize the man, or even cancel him, that\u2019s your prerogative.\n\nMy objection, which is shared by many across the political spectrum, is two-fold.\n\n1) The basic principle of freedom of speech. I don\u2019t think that someone should get into legal trouble for putting on a concert, period. If this principle is to mean anything, we unfortunately have to extend it to unpopular and/or unlikeable figures.\n\n2) The contention that Waters\u2019 performance somehow - which he has done in some form or fashion for literal decades now - somehow constitutes an admission of deeply-held fascist beliefs. Even if he holds unsavory views, that was clearly never his intention - no serious person at the time of the release of _The Wall_ understood it as such. It seems that Waters used the art to process both the death of his father in the war against Nazi Germany as well as the tide of far-right politics in Britain at the time (the National Front and, to a less extreme extent, Thatcher). To argue that his concert reveals that he has actually been a fascist this whole time would require the belief that he is lying on many key counts for decades at this point, and that everyone was credulous enough to go with it up until the other day.\n\nIf you want to go after Waters, fine, but to use this opportunity to do so represents either a severe lack of media literacy - something that I don\u2019t want to see take root, because it makes good, challenging art harder to produce - or a willingness to interpret an anti-fascist piece of media as pro-fascist, which is just engaging in bad faith.\n\nAgain, you can believe all of these things without thinking that Waters is a good guy, or worth defending as an individual.",

The musical is controversial because it points out there was always a home grown fascism in Britain even though they fought on the right side of WW2.\n\nThe fact that bigotry and neo-fascism are on the rise in the United States and Western Europe only proves The Wall right. If anything, it's reason for more people to see it and engage critically with its message.",

I wouldn\u2019t hold him to any more account than any other misinformed person. \n\nThe article brings up an interesting point of view regarding the use of Nazi symbols though. If someone is intentionally using Nazi symbols in a historical manner, we all agree that\u2019s okay. The nuance comes in when the person using those symbols has some seemingly counterintuitive beliefs about other topics. Does the same speech become less okay depending on the actions and history of the speaker?\n\nI personally think yes, which is why racial slurs are not okay for some groups and not for others. \n\nI know you\u2019re not in disagreement on this, just airing my thoughts on the subject",

Complaining about fascism imagery in an album intended to show the harms of fascism is not crazy.  Additionally he predicted how loneliness and isolation could lead to a new rise in fascism.  Anyone who's listened or even broadly understands the album would realize he was largely vindicated in this respect.  His Ukrainian takes are God awful and he is an antagonist, but bitching about the wall is the dumbest take in the world.",

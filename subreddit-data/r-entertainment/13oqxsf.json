These rehashes haven\u2019t been altogether successful, ranging from the pleasant but pointless (2016\u2019s The Jungle Book) to the pointless and childhood-scaring \u2013 Tim Burton\u2019s dour, steampunk Dumbo being a notable example.\u00a0\n\nHappily, The Little Mermaid comfortably leaps clear of the lot. It serves as a handsome homage while persuasively making the case as its own discrete entity. This time, Ariel is played by 23-year-old singer Halle Bailey. With five Grammy nominations, she brings an unarguable emotional force to the musical numbers, filling them with blustery yearning. On screen, too, she has genuine star wattage, outshining Jonah Hauer-King\u2019s Prince Eric.\u00a0\n\nHere, the poor chap is given even less to do than in the cartoon and, while he gamely essays a kind of hapless affability, he mostly comes across as, well, wet. It\u2019s the sort of role Hugh Grant once made his own, and I kept wishing a Grantish glint of self-awareness to redeem the foppish stammering.\n\n**Read the full review:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/the-little-mermaid-halle-bailey-disney-review/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/the-little-mermaid-halle-bailey-disney-review/)",

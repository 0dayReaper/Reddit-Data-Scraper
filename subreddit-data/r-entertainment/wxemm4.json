It doesn\u2019t even have to be near LA, if you want to have your garden that bad. \n\nYou not only save money (not like that\u2019s a problem); but you also save face and don\u2019t look like a total hypocrite about caring about the environment and climate change.\n\nYou know? The thing that will impact your five/six kids one day Kim and Kourtney? Fucking hell these privileged nitwits.\n\nI mean it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t travel everywhere in their private jets anyway? They travel in their private jets just to meet their baby\u2019s father, who is only miles away (45 minutes if you drive). \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know what/who I\u2019m referring to, it\u2019s Kendall Jenner and Travis Scott; aka two fools with money. At least Travis *used* to have talent though. \n\nJenner was just born into it and use a surgeon\u2019s (un)ethical talent to make her have a pillow face and diaper butt in her 20\u2019s in order to garner more fans and come out with a make up company. \n\nGreat marketing scheme on Kris\u2019s part, I have to admit. She\u2019s the real talent behind it all. She\u2019s probably one of the best parents in Hollywood when it comes to pimping their kids out for fame and money.",

Los Angeles meets these criteria.\n\nA desert climate can be hot or cold and is technically defined by the evapotranspiration rates, i.e. to be classified as a desert, colder areas must receive less water than warmer areas since more water evaporates or transpires through leaves at higher temperatures. But anyplace getting less than 15 inches of rain in a year is classified as a desert.\n\nGuess how much rain LA gets? Just a smidge less than 15 inches. \n\nIt is not a misconception that LA is a desert, it absolutely is one. It is a misconception that the Mediterranean climate zone does not encompass desert regions. It does. It also encompasses grassland and chaparral regions. But LA is not one of those. It's a desert.",

Does he sell Tesla stock and use that to pay for it? Absolutely freaking not, he'd pay capital gains tax. Tax is for the poor folk.\n\nWhat does he do? Applies for a several billion dollar loan with Deutsche Bank or whoever, using Tesla stock or whatever illiquid asset as collateral.\n\nHe'll eventually have to pay it back. But for now, he gets to live like a billionaire while he pays the bills by liquidating a few million here, few million there a couple times a year instead.\n\nAlso, don't even get me started on billionaires operating under LLCs. They basically buy nothing themselves, their LLC acts as a holding company for them. That way they're not spending their own money, and they personally own nothing, therefore are not personally taxed on the income. Their LLC is, and gets to write off all their losses as a tax break. They even get to carry those losses over to the following fiscal year, because US tax code is *amazing.*",

If You\u2019ve got Elon or Bezos levels of money you functionally would never be required to pay back the loans, you would just borrow additional money using the increased value of your shares to pay of prior loans.  As long as the total pool of shares isn\u2019t overused as collateral, you would be able to weather almost any downturn by borrowing against your existing shares and then just rolling forward the loans forever.  \n\nBasically, so long as the shares go up more than the interest on the loans on average, you never ever need to have income.  You just live off the infinite borrowing capacity, never selling shares and never realizing income until you die.  And combine that with stepped up basis at death and your heirs inherit your shares with a tax basis of the market value at the time that ownership transfers to them.  So the capital gains on the shares never even get taxed at all!  The heir can sell the shares tomorrow and pay zero capital gains taxes.",

Make sure that the higher tiers are charging greater than the marginal cost of acquiring more water on the part of the utility company or municipality.

Most places already do this, but an adjustment would need to be made in times of drought to make it more effective.",

Everyone knows this, including Kardashian fans.  It makes it appear to most of them, then, that fame and riches are only a viral moment away.  \n\nIt is a warped and distorted version of the American dream, but one that is very aptly suited for today's culture of social media views and likes, self-promotion, and self-gratification above all else.",

That\u2019s no problem for a Saudi company that gained access to water rights in California. It exports alfalfa grown here back to Saudi Arabia to support its mega-dairies. Saudi Arabia also imports hay from drought-stricken New Mexico for the same purpose.

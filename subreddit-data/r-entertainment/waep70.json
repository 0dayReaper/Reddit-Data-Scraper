However, rich people get offended by it and will work up some serious mental gymnastics to pretend like their life is hard. Everyone likes and wants to believe that they\u2019re a hustler. It\u2019s cooler to be a hustler. \n\nMy partner and I watch this show real housewives of Potomac and there\u2019s a girl like that named Mia. Her husband (+30 years older) owned like 14 ESTABLISHED  and already extremely profitable companies. He retired and let her \u201cmanage\u201d them as well as sunk in 100s of thousands of dollars for her to open up new franchise businesses. The companies that she is listed as the head of, he tells her what to pick and choose for decisions. \u201cHer\u201d new companies even have her husband listed as the owner according to her employees lol. \n\nIn her mind she\u2019s a \u201cboss bitch\u201d who has \u201cworked for everything\u201d that she has. She claims she brought those companies up and hustles to keep them profiting. She says her husband didn\u2019t give her money for her new businesses, he invested, which is the same thing lol.. she calls him her \u201cadvisor\u201d only since she\u2019s the boss but brings him to big decisions and his word is final. She\u2019s oh so busy all the time and constantly says her life is much harder than the peasants. It\u2019s mental gymnastics. \n\nTLDR: a stripper met an older rich guy, got with him, got handed extremely successful companies and money to build new businesses, and thinks she\u2019s a boss bitch who is a hustler. She couldn\u2019t even do like basic math on the show and is a complete idiot.",

A poor person might be able to have maybe one shot at hitting the bullseye, if it doesn't work they can't afford another go. Someone middle class might be able to have 2-3 tries over their lifetime before they can't afford any more. Someone like Branson can have as many tries as they want and get to pay extra to make it easier for them to win.\n\nThen you get the Musk types, they inherited the game then played it to make it look like they won",

The first chapter sets out how pretty much every UK celebrity went to some elite, super expensive private school. Politicians? Yup. Jeremy Clarkson? Yup. Even James Blunt? Yup.\n\nIt's all one big club and we're not in it.",

Through Giffords, she is a second-cousin-in-law of U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona.[21] Her godfather is director Steven Spielberg.[22][23][24] Her uncle is opera singer and actor Harry Danner, whose daughter, actress Hillary Danner,[25] is Paltrow's cousin and close friend. Paltrow recalls their family gatherings: \"Hillary and I always had this in common, and to this day ... cooking for people we love, eating, hanging out as a family. It's how we were raised. It's what we do.\"[26] Another cousin is Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, whose spouse is the Israeli-American millionaire Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork.\u201d",

He said that his dad gave him a lot of privilege and opportunity starting out getting into special effects and stuff.\n\nIt was so refreshing to hear somebody just tell the truth and just admit what they had.\n\nHe\u2019s a clever guy and good tv personality, but it might never have happened without the first little step up from his dad was basically what he was saying. Props to the guy I say",

His immigrant parents deliver newspapers in the wee hours of the morning and his dad recently messed up his back. To make sure they don\u2019t lose their route, this kid wakes up at 3 AM and delivers papers. He sleeps for an hour or so, studies his ass off, and then does 8 hours of VERY tough work for less pay than he would get at a big box retailer, all while patients and families praise how comforting he is to them and their loved ones. He was flagged by HR for punching 10 min late twice in a week and was going to be written up, which would minimize his already scant raise, before I told them to fuck off with that. \n\nBut please, Gwen. Tell me how tough your road was to selling pussy scented candles and cunt stuffing rocks. Can\u2019t imagine how much harder it was having to prove yourself BECAUSE you started on third base. Hope you choke on every bit of your pseudoscience-influencer bullshit.",

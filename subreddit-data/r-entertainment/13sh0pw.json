            "comment": "Despite its battle with Gov. Ron DeSantis, [Disney](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS/) remains committed to the state of Florida.\n\nThe media and theme park juggernaut is set to invest $17 billion in central Florida\u2019s Walt Disney World hub over the next decade, which includes the potential creation of 13,000 jobs.\n\nThose figures have been repeated by CEO Bob Iger and parks chief Josh D\u2019Amaro over the past few months, as tensions between Disney and Florida lawmakers have continued to ratchet up. The fight has taken on even more significance now that DeSantis is officially [running for president](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/ron-desantis-launches-white-house-bid.html).\n\nIn April, [the company filed a lawsuit accusing DeSantis](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/disney-sues-florida-gov-ron-desantis-alleges-political-effort-to-hurt-its-business.html)\u00a0and the new board members of its special district of carrying out a campaign of political retribution against the entertainment giant.\n\nDeSantis targeted Disney\u2019s special district, formerly called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, after the company publicly criticized a controversial Florida bill \u2014 dubbed \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d by critics \u2014 that limits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms.\n\n\u201cWe never wanted, and we certainly never expected, to be in the position of having to defend our business interests in federal court, particularly having such a terrific relationship with the state as we\u2019ve had for more than 50 years,\u201d Iger said during the company\u2019s earnings call earlier this month.\n\nMore: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/26/disney-florida-spending-desantis-fight.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/26/disney-florida-spending-desantis-fight.html)",

It's trying very hard to be a female Indy series, with a stuffy Brit sidekick and a goofy secretary. It was actually a pretty fun way to kill an hour. XD\n\nRelic Hunter is actually a ripoff of a ripoff- it's very clearly trying to ride the popularity of the Tomb Raider games, complete with Tia Carrere wearing a knockoff of Lara Croft's outfit if I remember right.",

The crystal skull one was the \u201cone\u201d where they could capitalize the original audience and hook a younger one. And they didn\u2019t. \nI\u2019m going to be there opening weekend, I think PWB is hilarious and I love the character of Indy, but I have low expectations. \n\nALSO: I am introducing my 7 year old and wife to the movies and after rewatching Temple of Doom I have an issue with people shitting on the fridge scene from the Crystal Skull film. The sequence with the plane and the inflatable raft and landing that and then doing a sleigh ride\u2026plus more, and then the Cramping on cgi monkeys is hilarious",

Wish-fulfillment, i suppose  there\u2019s an element there that loses its luster with age, but I think a bigger issue is era and\u2026well, age itself.\n\nOlder actors simply are going to struggle with the demands of the role.  No matter how fit he is, Ford\u2019s age is going to affect what they can do with Indy.  And frankly even if it didn\u2019t having an 80 year old running around acting the same way he did 40 years younger is just not going to really work.  I don\u2019t think this is an insurmountable problem, but I do think you\u2019d need to have the guts(and talent) to make a movie that is *very* different from the established franchise and which actually explores what Indy would do to stay in the game at that age when he was already feeling wear and tear on his body when he was fairly young.  \n\nBut even then\u2026.I just don\u2019t know that you can take Indy out of the 20s-40s.  He\u2019s pretty heavily tied to that time period, because of how heavily inspired he is by serials of that era as a character.  50s was pushing it, but it honestly just feels *wrong* imagining Indy puttering around a few years after the Summer of Love.  And certainly trying to cram Nazis in there is\u2026well, blatantly just trying to cram them in.",

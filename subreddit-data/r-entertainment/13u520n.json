So no, it\u2019s not 150k for a haircut. It\u2019s 150k for one actress to have her hair styled and wigged very day for many months. Still expensive.. but that\u2019s film making for you.",

The reasons she didn't used a wig even though that would had been cheaper was because her mom empathized how important natural hair was. So instead of wigs they used hair extensions which I'm assuming they used real human hair to make it look natural on her even though it's not even her hair.",

You couldn't use it and we'd have to start again. It was a process.\"\n\nThere\u2019s multiple reasons why custom hair is so expensive- \na good portion of that price comes from product costs and we have ZERO control over that. \nReal hair wefts cost thousands by themselves.\nThen consider someone is putting time, skill, and care to safely create a desired look with her natural hair. This stylist more than likely has many years of experience and many many hours of extended education. They certainly deserve a fair hourly wage, specially when working on a multimillion dollar movie.\n\nJust because we make it look easy, doesn\u2019t mean that it is.\n\nMajority of these comments are exactly why I\u2019m ready to quit the industry. I\u2019ve been doing hair for well over 13 years and lately people have been really condescending towards our work. In order to professionally become a hairstylist, you have to go through 1500-2000 hours of schooling. We then have to pass a written as well as a technical exam.\n\nWe spend (depending on salon) hundreds to thousands every year on extended education, maintaining tools, getting new tools, buying product, advertising, booth rent or building rent, utilities (that water bill is no joke), finding decent insurance (regular massage / chiropractic sessions are necessary because of how quickly our back, knees, wrists and shoulders wear down) etc.\n\nBut we\u2019re not worth a living wage??\n\nIt\u2019s a great trade but we get looked down on. \u201cIt\u2019s not a real job\u201d",

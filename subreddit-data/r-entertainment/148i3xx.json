Disney's 2000s line-up is a bit hard to define as a specific \"era\" because it varied between beloved classics (lilo, princess &amp; frog) and some of Disney's worst (chicken lil, home on the range), and some cult classics that are loved now but weren't hits when they came out (emperor's groove, meet the robinsons, atlantis, treasure planet).\n\nTangled in 2010 really set the stage for Disney's new decade lineup and they remained pretty consistent from then on, but if you want you can extend the beginning of that renaissance period back to Princess &amp; The Frog",

But even their own earnings report showcase that there's something fundamentally wrong with the company and nobody from Disney finances (CFO) or even CEO himself, Robert Iger, knows how to fix it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Disney\u2019s revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (January-March) was $21.815 billion and its income from continuing operations before income taxes was $2.123 billion. This means that Disney\u2019s expenses for the quarter were about $19.692 billion (revenue minus income).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To compare, Disney\u2019s revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (October-December) was $23.512 billion and its income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1.773 billion2. This means that Disney\u2019s expenses for the quarter were about $21.739 billion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Disney\u2019s net profit margin for 2019 was **15.88%**. This means that Disney was much more profitable in 2019 than in 2023, when its net profit margin was only **4.74%**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's not the end. Apparently Disney Parks are having lower number of attendances than Universal Orlando. That's scary because without Disney Parks flooding Disney with money, the company is on a really dangerous course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Walt Disney World parks in June 2023 was 4 out of 10, which is relatively low compared to other months. The lowest crowd days were June 1-4 and June 26-30, while the highest crowd days were June 11-12 and June 18-19.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Universal Orlando parks in June 2023 was 6 out of 10, which is moderate to high compared to other months.

Both Phases 1 and 2 were generally well received.\n\nBefore Disney bought Star Wars, the prequel series under Lucas was very polarizing. It's unquestionable that fans did not view it in the same light as the original trilogy. They really hated him for it. \n\nSo when The Force Awakens came out just like the prequel series that too was polarizing. Instead of taking time with the sequel trilogy Iger decided to push the yearly Star Wars movie release anyways. \n\nYes, Kathleen Kennedy shares some of the blame for the state of Star Wars, but she is not the only one to blame. Iger's decision to stick with the short yearly schedule really hurt the franchise.",

Highest grossing (domestic) film of all time, really well reviewed (some internet subsets felt it was too safe) and really put Star Wars back in the front, front of the zeitgeist. \n\nIt was only after it became totally clear that JJA had zero plan going into it that it retroactively became panned for bringing essentially nothing to the table. And I will say to JJs credit, (at least in TFA) all the new characters introduced were pretty great. Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylo Ren all totally stole the show. \n\nAnyway, I digress! I just think back on 2015 fondly because I loved TFA, felt like everyone around me loved star wars again and I was so optimistic about the future of the franchise!",

I like his producing work but everything he makes himself is always lacking something.\n\nBut we\u2019re not going to see any X-Men in the MCU until probably Secret Wars.  Even then, it\u2019ll likely be some of the Fox cast (Jackman, McKellen, Stewart) since they\u2019ve hinted at it themselves.  My guess is they\u2019ll pop up after Secret Wars so they can set up an Avengers vs X-Men Phase/movie",

Andor is easily the best out of everything to come out post original trilogy. Mandolarian's first two seasons were really good (season 3 not so much but one poor season doesn't ruin a show for me, unless it's the final season which isn't the case here)\n\n**I'm not saying that the sequel movies were bad. In my opinion, they're better than the prequels. But I don't love them and I don't rewatch them. I feel like they're just there. I just don't care about them.**",

It\u2019s taking the place of \u201cAvengers: Secret Wars,\u201d which is jumping from May 1, 2026, to May 7, 2027.\n\nIt sounds like they're changing things up before Kang/Secret Wars. Introducing the Fantastic Four beforehand is pretty big. Also I assume the delay is so they can set something up incase Majors has to be fired. Maybe they already have a plan in place.\n\nAnyways hearing that Deadpool 3 moved up from November to May has me really excited. I honestly don't care about Kang Dynasty at this point. I'm so burnt on the multiverse. But another Deadpool? Sign me up.",

Now that it's streaming maybe eventually one night if I have the time and there's nothing else on and I have nothing else to do I'll watch it.

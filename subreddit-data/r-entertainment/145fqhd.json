The original actors likely have aged too much to keep the same appearance as the first movie,  filming/special effects will have changed too much, and the audience will be older. I read the list, and you can totally see the obvious money grabs. I know it's a business, and making money is the point, but quality is important, too. Lots of the movies have entirely too much of a time gap between them to be worthwhile. I totally want to see Tron 3, but like 8 years ago. Animal 2? Definitely in 2010ish. I'll watch the Meg 2, not because I think its gonna have a good story but because it's still possible to keep it similar to the first one. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say I would like some fresh entertainment that I can watch with both my elderly parents and teen kids without it being labeled a \"family movie\".

The company was struggling at the time already due to the war, it wasn\u2019t the Disney we know today (it happened more in 50s after parks, 80s saw the company leadership and what it owned change a lot and 00s saw a lot of purchases). Disney saw the people he worked as friends and family and then felt like they didn\u2019t. It\u2019s human reaction to feel betrayal when people you trust do something like that when you are already struggling. I am not saying they should not have had a strike, but like above poster said, he was trying in his own way to reward people. He just didn\u2019t understand that it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nAnd people had very different view of strikes then and you can\u2019t compare then and now directly.",

They worked crazy hours without proper compensation, and when their movie Snow White became a big success, they didn't get the bonuses they were promised. The strike lasted for months, but in the end, Disney had to give in to their demands. This strike changed the animation industry and led to better working conditions for artists. It's a reminder that standing together and fighting for what's right can make a difference.",

While up there, they celebrated his birthday and as a joke, the writers put on a Mickey and Minnie animated short porn clip, after a night of partying and drinking. It\u2019s said that Walt laughed and carried on like the others. The following week when they got back to the office, he fired the entire crew. Moral of the story that was well known after that: never fuck with the Mouse.",

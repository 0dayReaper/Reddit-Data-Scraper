Nec fasc is exceedingly rare, occuring about 700-1150 times each year in the US according to CDC. That would be 3-4 orders of magnitude less common than you described and makes much more sense considering it's high fatality rate. If 1.6/100 men got fourniers, you would very likely know someone who died of it.  \n\nNec fasc is a bacterial infection like cellulitis that extends into the fascial plane. Fascia is a rough, non-stretchy tissue that acts as a barrier and separator for different body compartments. Bacteria that begin growing along fascia can grow very rapidly, as there is much less blood flow and the fascia can easily separate from surrounding tissue to provide ample space. The result is a highly lethal, rapidly progressive bacterial infection.",

A third is struggling because they have bad scoliosis and being on drum line makes it worse. \n\nI am truly terrified for them as adults. Their bodies are going to be destroyed.

In the dorm you have tv and games(like cards) and a microwave to cook food. You have access to courses and the library. I completed multiple University units. I also had a guitar. There are sports leagues like softball and basketball. Full access to canteen. Movie nights. You can also work jobs to break up the time and earn more money. Full access to the gym which has pool tables and ping pong. And contact visits where you can hug and kiss your family and friend. and eat food together. \n\nThe mental strain in ad seg is immense.",

The accusations wouldn\u2019t be enough to convince a jury on a criminal standard, the forced confession tipped the civil trial completely.\n\nThe second prosecutor was a stone cold moron who wanted to make a big shot name. Threw out the constitution to win and so of course it was overturned.",

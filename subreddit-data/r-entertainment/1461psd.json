Deadline released the summary back in 2016 when it was announced Amy was cast.\n\n&gt;[Amy] Schumer will play a character in who lives in Barbieland, but gets kicked out because she\u2019s not perfect enough and does not fit the mold. She then goes on an adventure in the real world and by the time she returns to Barbieland to save it, she has gained the realization that perfection comes on the inside, not the outside, and that the key to happiness is belief in oneself.\n\nIt was a complete anthesis about how Barbie can be anything and anyone and comes in all shapes and sizes and would basically be mocking how Amy is too big and not pretty enough to be Barbie.",

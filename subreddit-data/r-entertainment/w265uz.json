Kim recently divorced Kanye West after 8 years and four kids. Almost immediately Pete Davidson was very public with Kim, he was at her house a lot, with her and kanyes kids etc. Pete also got Kanye's and Kim's children names tattooed on himself. He's been \"trolling\" Kanye quite a bit too, telling him how he should take care of his family, this is what you need to or should have done, here is how \"o*ur\"* kids need to see this through etc.. So of course people take sides, I personally have lost all respect for Pete, and I think all three of them suck. I realized that I was kinda of brainwashed or peer-pressured into liking Pete Davidson and never really questioned why. But to me, Pete seems to have been antagonizing Kanye, and a lot justify it as Kanye put his family through a lot of crap due to...well, just kanye things. \n\nAt least that's what I've gathered through reading headlines, twitter posts etc.",

The sources I provided misinterpreted the original study (TLDR: 5 g is the upper bound observed for microplastic ingestion rather than the average level seen). However microplastic contamination of food and water sources still seem to be a legitimate problem that needs to be studied further (and plastic waste management is undeniably a huge environmental problem as well)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2Ntp6BqhSng",

It's like 3 minutes long so watch it if you're interested. ](https://youtu.be/2Ntp6BqhSng)\n\nLong story short the WWF did a literature review on ingesting plastic, where they look at all the studies they can find on a topic and compile them together. They found that all studies ever conducted fell between 0.1g and 5g of plastic a week. (note the 5g number was a single person from a single study. NOT a recurring value)\n\nAnd for scientific analysis this range is pretty useless. It is WAY too broad to draw any concrete conclusions other than \"plastic is bad.\"  But as microplastic consumption is a serious issue, this is the number they ran with in their activism campaigns. The lower bound was not mentioned.\n\nThis report was then briefly cited in a scientific paper published by the University of Vienna as background information as an upper limit for microplastics, again without mentioning the lower bound. As this was just background information and not the topic of the paper itself, it got through the editing and peer-review process without being fact-checked and was published.\n\nAnd then the media picks it up, starting with the New York Post. It spreads, and most of them cite this paper as a source without looking any further into it.",

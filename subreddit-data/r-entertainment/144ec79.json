I have been arguing this for over a decade since I rewatched it for the first time since it originally came out. \n\nIt was far too clever for the audiences at the time. It's the perfect humor for today's more meta aware audiences. In a world where Rick and Morty is huge and Everything Everywhere All At Once won Oscar's, The Last Action Hero fits in perfectly.\n\nI didnt even fully understand how genius the movie was until Charles Dance gets his hand on the ticket and then starts villian monologing directly into the camera breaking the 4th wall. Oh but it's not only that. As he monologues while walking through his penthouse he walks past a mirror backed bar... and you can see the film crew very clearly in the mirror. Mix that with multiple action sequences with disgustingly obvious stunt actors and hard edits back to the actor... it's just beautiful how self aware the movie was.",

While when put down on paper the ideas of those movies could be seen as being very similar in many ways, in execution they are different beasts. \n\nI guess what I was saying with Hot Shots and Last Action Hero is that Hot Shots was what studios kind of sold Last Action Hero as. A tongue in cheek fun time lampooning the genre. Where LAH was seemingly made more for viewers who were interested in a bit more of an... ironic(?) exploration into the nature of the genre. \n\nIn that one of the jokes they do multiple times is having a wide shot stunt like when Arnie jumps into an elevator. It's all one wide shot but it starts with Arnies Stunt Man jumping from above the elevator. Then when he hits the ground the edit happens where it becomes Arnie, all still the same one wide shot. Where the gag is really clever is that they miss like 3 or 4 frames in the edit so it's a hard jerk from one standing position to the other, and they are not even on the same mark. In the end it's a \"blink and you miss it\" kind of gag that is there for the people who would be able to understand this very esoteric joke. I'm pretty sure the average audience would just never even notice anything happened. I know I didnt catch that till my 2nd rewatch.\n\nOh also LAH is secretly a Jacob's Ladder scenario. That poor annoying little kid totally bleed out while handcuffed to his toilet. The entire movie is just his dream as he is slowly dying. That wasnt Jack bleeding out in the ambulance that was the stupid kid putting his fantasy on top of himself. He is even been tracked down by death from a movie personified. And before you ask, yes I do smoke pot.",

I distinctly recall there were whispers even then, in the pre-internet days, that the film was a potential flop and when an advanced preview was shown -and I was fortunate enough to get to see it- I realized the studios had reason to be nervous.  Time proved their fears justified.  The film didn\u2019t do very well at the box office and one could look back on it as the start of the decline of Arnold\u2019s golden reign at the box office.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong: The film has its moments and I don\u2019t feel it is a *disaster*.  But neither do I feel like others \u2018round these parts that its some unjustly neglected classic.  To me, and this is IMHO, the film only worked in spurts.  There were clever moments here and there but the film never seemed to properly find its tone or \u201cspeed\u201d.  There were stretches where our protagonist (always a tricky thing to have a kid as your protagonist, even if he\u2019s working hand in hand with Arnold) was annoying.  There were moments that simply had me shaking my head (when the \u201cfictional\u201d Arnold meets the \u201creal\u201d Arnold and expresses his disdain for the star, I didn\u2019t understand what the joke even meant\u2026!).\n\nAnyway, it was a decent enough film in the end and I can see it being a \u201ccult\u201d classic but a hidden real classic?  I don\u2019t think so.  Too much didn\u2019t work to overcome what *did* work.\n\nAnd say what you will about the studios, they kinda knew they had a potential failure on their hands.",

Yes, the fictional Arnie in the \u201creal\u201d world had a lot of problems but\u2026 was that the \u201creal\u201d Arnie\u2019s fault?  He\u2019s an actor.  He works on films that a whole host of others, including screenwriters, directors, etc. etc. work on and to \u201cblame\u201d and be angry at the real Arnie for the fact that the fictional one made it into the real world is\u2026 again, I can\u2019t get my head around that sequence.\n\nWas it meant to be funny in the sense that it is parodying a Frankenstein monster type situation?  I genuinely don\u2019t know!\n\nYeah, I suppose as you noted its a weird philosophical point and it is indeed part of the reason I felt the film lost me at times.",

The studios were wrong.\n\nNope.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think the film was an out and outright disaster, but it just seemed like McTiernan wasn\u2019t the right director for what was something of a farce/comedy.  Yeah, his best films had laugh out loud moments, but he was more of a master, IMHO, of building good tension and following it up with explosive action\u2026 *then* hitting us with a humorous aside.\n\n*The Last Action Hero* was intended to be primarily a comedy and secondary an action film and neither element seemed to really gel, despite some good sequences here and there and humorous asides.",

I remember leaving the theater and thinking for the first time in my life that maybe the people making the film were doing drugs while making the film? \nIt has its moments - but it\u2019s ultimately too uneven, disjointed. Some of the satire works, some of it feels forced. I don\u2019t think McTiernan is a great straight comedy director - even through his films can be *very* funny - it\u2019s a different form of comedy that worked for him in the past.",

And I really couldn\u2019t with the kid character, who happened to be the biggest Arnold fan in the world. It just felt too up its own backside with nudges and in-jokes that were so over-the-top they didn\u2019t feel like in-jokes anymore. It felt like someone was telling jokes and screaming the punchlines so you didn\u2019t miss them. It also was kind of like *Hook*: everything was so bluntly conveyed it lost any humor and subtlety. Granted, I was in my twenties at the time, and seeing it as a kid might\u2019ve been a very difference experience.",

Which is often why you dont see too many non party runs actually get on the ballots. EVen for the rich, the number of people you need to just get on the ballot is huge. especially these states where you got to send people to every district. and you have to get a sizeable number more than required because a sizeable percent of your signatures will be bullshit because you are hiring min wage workers off the street and some just sit at home making up names.",

First time I met him was when he sponsored my opponent in a chill cook-off in Dallas. My chili came in second place, his was third. *I beat Ross Perot*.\n\nHad occasional run-ins with him over the years. I was a substitute organist and choir director at a church he attended. More than once I watched with a mix of horror and amusement as he asked people to clear out the pew where he wanted to sit with his entourage. He arrived late for a choir and bell concert I was directing and just, kinda loudly, made people move, in the middle of the recital. You get used to a lot of stuff when you do church music, people are always coming and going, there's always something happening with the clergy doing this and that, but usually people are at least a little bit respectful. Not Ross Perot.\n\nI wouldn't be lying if I said the reason I didn't vote for him is because he disrupted my wonderful lovely bell choir :-/\n\nUsually when I know a candidate personally they get my vote no matter what. Only two exceptions I've had to make, Perot and Sinema. (How I know Sen. Sinema personally is a story for another day, but suffice it to say she's changed since the early 2000s. If I was a family member I'd wonder if she shouldn't get checked for a brain tumor or something, because she has *really* changed.)",

I stopped when she was running for Senate, and suddenly -- and I do mean suddenly -- she changed the campaign strategy from a broad based democratic platform to an obsessively single issue \"veteran housing benefits\" line. Literally all campaign literature, every canvassing script, the polling tress, everything was laser focused on that. \n\nI'm not suggesting anyone was ever *against* veteran housing benefits or whatever, but it simply was not a major concern until it became *everything*. I have my suspicions that she was getting money under the table to strategize as a spoiler against McCain.\n\nNow I might have to disclose how I knew John McCain. Long story short, my father-in-law had a piece of property adjacent to his place in Yavapai County. They were pretty casual, apolitical acquaintances.

He did not like to live in luxury and was happy to spend little money on cheap food over expensive stuff so he naturally did not jive well with this woman. One thing he pointed out was that she never brought wallet or any cash on their adventures together so he had to pay for everything because she was so used to having someone manage the actual spending part of her life. It wasn\u2019t even like a \u201cgentleman should pay\u201d or \u201ccover me and i\u2019ll pay you back\u201d. it was really the point that money was never an issue in life and operated largely like some abstract concept without a physical presence attached (i know it still is lol).",

So it\u2019s fairly recent. I thought it was also hilarious how his future concept city plans was a roughly sketched donut shape on a wall and his \u201cfuture homes\u201d rendering posters were straight up indiscernible blurs. I\u2019d love to see the sheriffs dept actually start throwing shit outside in 3 days\u2026 can you imagine the shit show of opportunists waiting like vultures as boxes of Kanye\u2019s shit is just piled up on the sidewalk and the media making it an even greater spectacle attracting a mob of jobless lowlifes, live streamers, and riffraff?",

I know the bipolar disorder is like a cousin to schizophrenia. They can have overlapping symptoms. This man is running everything he has and himself to the ground. It\u2019s just sad.

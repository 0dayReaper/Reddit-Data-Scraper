With the amount of $$$ they have already sunk into it I also find it unlikely that they will recast and reshoot a bunch of scenes. That along with the recquired changes with SFX that comes with it just makes the number go so much higher. I mean we are talking at least an extra $100mil right off the top. Then you have all the other post production costs that ripple out from the recasting. Then you have marketing and all the other fluff that adds to a movies budget after its wrapped production... I mean WTF.\n\n It's so nuts that this movie is still being made and has to keep going through this ridiculously silly development hell. It's already iffy if it will be capable of making a profit in theaters and it's not unfeasible that it could, if shit keeps getting worse, be a half a billion dollar flop. \n\nThe documentary on the making of/failure of this movie will be fun.",

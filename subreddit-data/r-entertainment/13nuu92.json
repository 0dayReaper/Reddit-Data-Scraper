Not only did they strike oil, they actually present a pretty compelling argument for adding choreography/stunt categories to the Oscars. After all, they\u2019re basically just ballets. Really, really violent ballets, but ballets nonetheless.\n\nI\u2019m also really grateful that they\u2019re sort of setting a new standard for action movies. Remember when fight scenes were just shakey-cam and extremely fast cuts?",

John wick runs along those lines but has some cooler nuanced things (for action) woven into it and you can just pick it up and grasp what's happening and enjoy it.\n\nI haven't seen chapter 4 yet and I just found out the other day donnie yen is in it so I am PUMPED",

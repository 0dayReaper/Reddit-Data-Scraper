I\u2019m not saying he isn\u2019t a creepy bastard, but I was told by my grandparents that Sharon Tate famously never wore shoes.\n\nEdit: To clarify, I don\u2019t think he, or anyone for that matter, is a creep for having a foot fetish. Sharon Tate didn\u2019t like shoes, so Margot Robbie being barefoot is justified. There are many other scenes however of completely unnecessary foot shots; it is those scenes that I was referring when I called him a creepy bastard. Even then, it\u2019s more hyperbole, cause foot fetish really is the tamest fetish you could have.",

But we have zero evidence that he does anything like this. In fact, the footage makes it into the actual film.\n2. Art and sexuality can be connected, and it doesn't necessarily have to be one or the other. An artist could be obsessed with the female body and make all their paintings of the female body... but not necessarily do so for sexual gratification.\n3. Points 1 and 2 undercut your whole \"but the actresses aren't consenting!\" argument... because they've consented to be in tarantinos film, which is an art form. Also his obsession with feet in film is well known at this point. So hard to argue any actress is joining the film not knowing that or feeling pressured into something weird.\n\nTL,DR: You're writing narratives in your head based on no evidence. Hell, you haven't been on set with Tarantino, have you? Do you have any idea what the atmosphere was like while he filmed that scene with Robbie? No, you don't. Have you talked to her? Has she said he was super creepy about it and was jerking it or something outrageous while filming? No.\n\nSo why are you assuming and calling it problematic?",

But Tarantino goes out of his way to, in his multi-million dollar movies, do close ups of feet, shoehorn in shots of actresses in bare feet, make the scene-edits highlight the feet. And this is something that happens so often that people have made a meme about it at this point, as you can see. And when you start kinda forcing that kink into a public sphere, especially one on the more niche side like feet (vs say something more universally enjoyed like butt slapping or something) then people will think it creepy.",

If you actually watch his movies they are used to good effect, the closeups.\n\nTarantino is obsessed with making movies that touch on things that aren't commonly explored in other topics. Often other directors ignore feet because they don't know how to make it meaningful. Tarantino does.\n\nI'm not sure why he is shamed for that.",

I had heard that he sort of had a love of feet so I, in the audition one of the first things I did was I took my shoes off and I plopped my feet up on the table right in front of him. His eyes went (makes popping open noise). I knew the feet were going to play a big part.\u201d\n\nMary Elizabeth Winstead talking about her audition for DP.\n\n&gt;Interviewer: Quentin\u2019s a well-known cinematic foot fetishist \u2013 at any point did he try to shoot your feet?\n\n&gt;MEW: [Laughs] No, he didn't. But yeah, I went to the audition in flip-flops. Oh, I knew. \n\n&gt;Yeah, I knew that. I got the notes and everyone was kind of like, \u201cDid you read that, that says he wants you to wear flip-flops?\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, yeah, he likes feet. I know that. I'm aware.\u201d So I got a pedicure, and everything, and I kind of did the same thing that Sydney Poitier says she did, where she just kind of flipped off a shoe -- threw off her flip-flops and put her feet on the table. \n\n&gt;I kind of did that as well, even though my feet, my feet aren't an important part of the film, where a couple of other girls, they are. [Laughs] Their feet are showcased, but mine weren't. But, just in case, I put them out there.",

Tarantino's whole shtick is pushing limits and doing/saying/writing things that nobody else wants to tackle because he feels like it needs to be done.  \n  \n  To be real, Margot Robbie was just fully nude, having sex scenes, and flashing her vagina in a toddler's room to punish someone in the bigger movie right before this.  \n  \n  Is that really any different than this foot kink fan service situation where in Tarantino's mind, he is just being detail oriented and giving himself the film he would go see?  \n  \n  If someone said that he was waiting in their trailer after a shoot and demanded he be allowed to jerk off on her foot against her consent, this would be a whole different conversation. But, in reality, a very pretty and extremely talented adult woman was paid millions of dollars to get her feet dirty, keep her clothes on, and showcase her talent.  \n  \n  Also, I feel like more than half the women Quentin casts are strong enough to stand up to him if he crosses their boundaries.  \n  \n  So for the above person to be comparing Polanski is just some dumbness.",

            "comment": "Feet are shapely parts of the body. Straight up. They photograph nicely. Bare feet are used in visual art ALL THE TIME. \n\nBare feet (and feet with shoes frankly) in context of a scene definitely help add context to the state a character is in. Are they barefoot because of poverty? Are they sick in a hospital bed? Are they very relaxed? Are they Well taken care of or dirty and rough? Fuckin\u2019 idiot know-it-alls only want to point to his fetish and take away completely from what he is establishing in a shot. Yea he probably likes feet, but because he is a film maker and likes how they shoot, and he shoots them well. \n\nPulp Fiction: Uma dances barefoot. This establishes along with the dancing that she is comfortable with this individual beyond Vincent being just a bodyguard \u201cdate\u201d. She kicked off her shoes to \u201clet her hair down\u201d. \n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn: He sucks the toes of the dancer. Its a dramatic choice and a somewhat shocking scene first time seeing it - The character in his mind at this moment, is the predator. The dancer (Selma Hayek) is barefoot and seductive. She carries a snake. He opens his mouth like a snakely predator to feed himself-sexually. Thinking he has the power. Her bare feet imply harmlessness or subordination. Then expectations based on all this are completely reversed. \n\nJackie Brown: Flirty bare feet. Also implying a relaxed feeling in an uncomfortable environment. Maybe also implying she is partially \u201ccaptive\u201d? Not overtly-but she\u2019s not going anywhere. \n\nKill Bill 1: Paralyzed feet filmed from a low angle. Implying heroism and serving as a vehicle to pace the movie forward. \u201cMove your big toe\u201d. Starting with one of the most insignificant, small, easily forgotten body parts to begin healing from paralysis. \n\nKill Bill 2. Flying kick dirty feet.  What a great shot. I don\u2019t even need to explain this one.\n\nDeath Proof: Shots of relaxed bare feet. Care free, comfortable, cool. And a self-awareness into the characters own sexiness. You get all this from the foot. Thats clever shooting there. Feet on the dash- VERY relaxed in a way that is actually not safe in real life. Implies more care free attitude again right before disruption. This movie plays on that comfortable feeling of riding with your feet on the dash the same way Jaws made people afraid of the ocean.\n\nDjango, Hateful Eight, Reservoir Dogs\u2026cant think of 1 foot shot. Maybe he doesn\u2019t need to put in needlessly in his movies. Maybe.. just maybe he knows more about how to tell a compelling and captivating story using film than any prudish rubes in here who \u201chate feet\u201d. \n\nWhy would you hate feet? Cut yours off then. Feet are great and shouldn\u2019t be hated. Unless you just hate walking\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

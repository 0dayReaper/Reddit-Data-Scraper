I don\u2019t know if I love or hate this country. I don\u2019t think America makes any sense.\u201d \n\nMichael Shannon  \n\nI've arrived at this also. What I would rail against is the wasted potential of this country, all of this wealth, the resources, only to realize that, in the end, was it an illusion all along?",

All while that\u2019s going on the politicians who promise to do better are in the pockets of all the other rich people so nothing ever gets done bc why would the rich want everyone else to survive ? They only care about themselves. America is selfish. That\u2019s how I\u2019d describe it.",

            "comment": "I spoke to Kenneth several years ago about Disney child star Bobby Driscoll.  Long after he was alone and abandoned by Hollywood, Bobby ran into Kenneth at Andy Warhol's Art Studio, \"The Factory\" in 1967, where Bobby was working on some of his art. He said Bobby asked him to loan some money for rent. Well, Kenneth was smart enough to know the truth, but Bobby was at his most charming and convinced to loan him $20 bucks. Bobby actually lived in an abandoned building on Tompkin's Park at 371 East 10th Street in Alphabet City on the Eastside of Manhattan.  Kenneth said Bobby was an Irish Leprechaun, charming and witty, despite the hard times on which he had fallen.",

We just loved that show and I\u2019m a male btw rofl not that if matters but it\u2019s just so well done.\n\nFuck it , might go binge it again. That scene where she gets caught cheating is 12/10 acting from all parties involved. Maybe one of my favorite scenes in film in general up there with the closing scene of the godfather one. Am I crazy for thinking that?  So much better and versatile in emotions then the acting in Wednesday.",

They kind of self canceled the show when Fincher was working on Mank and wanted to put Mindhunter on the back burner for a while with an option to possibly later return.\n\nHe said that they were working 90 hour weeks and it wasn't worth it with the offered budget and time constraints. Netflix didn't want to spend a fortune on it and Fincher wanted a break from it anyway, but money was still on the table to get it done. It's not like Netflix said \"no, you're not making another season\".\n\nIf you are pissed about it, then your anger is misguided. Fincher is the one who thought it was unfair to hold the actors to their contracts when he was the one who wanted to pursue other projects.",

It was just a massive letdown. I\u2019ve also never played the game or read the book so I have no reference to source material.

No hate to Hemsworth but I just don\u2019t see it going well, and without Cavill to push back on the bullshit it will go downhill even faster.\n\nFor some reason writers like to take material and \u2018make it their own\u2019 but all that tells me is they\u2019re not a good enough writer to get their own IP developed. So they take a beloved universe like The Witcher and chop and twist until it doesn\u2019t resemble itself. Same thing was done to GoT after they ran out of book material, though at least in the beginning before they caught up to the books it followed it somewhat closely with a few notable exceptions like Lady Stoneheart.",

I'm the furthest thing from a book purist myself, so I don't mind the story goes in another direction from them. But what I do take issue with is that the story we were set up for was not well-planned. The characters are different, the story is haphazard, and there's an endless list of production issues behind it. I'm hardly optimistic for S3, much less a fifth one. \n\nBut of those things, my biggest complaint was characterization. I loved Ciri of the books but didn't like her character in the show at all. Geralt, Jaskier, and Yennefer were very different- in some ways for better, others for worse- but it wasn't the same characters I fell in love with from the books. And *Eskel*. Poor Eskel :(\n\nTo me that's the most important bit of any story in any medium- the characters are what people listening will relate to and remember and get emotional responses from, and if you have a dull or poorly designed plot, they'll save the story to some extent. With pre-established characters, it's important to do those characterizations justice, even if the storylines go in another direction. Otherwise, you've got absolutely nothing to appeal  to any viewer/reader/etc. It becomes sloppy and a mockery of its source.",

I liked aspects of it, but just couldn't get into 90% of it. The inaccuracies aren't inherently problematic. Adaptations do need to... adapt. But most of the extra stuff was just really bad and frequently completely missed the point of what I actually liked about the books in the first place.\n\nOne of the biggest offenders for me was Nilfgaard. In addition to the horrendously stupid looking armor, they were changed from being mage-oppressing, cold-hearted pragmatists who had tremendous national pride and felt they deserved to rule the world to... generic religious nutjobs with evil wizards.\n\nThere's no reason for the change, and it completely shifts the dynamic of Nilfgaard vs the undisciplined, emotional, self-indulgent Northern kings. Instead of an interesting contrast between the two, they're all the same and the Nilfgaard kind of come across like idiots who probably can't conquer anything.\n\nSimilarly, I don't know what happened in season 2, but how they introduced Vilgifortz (probably spelled that wrong) in season 1 was terrible. I get needing to introduce core villains in a TV show sooner rather than later, but it changed his character so much as to be unrecognizable. He became an irrational man acting in fear rather than the smartest guy in the room who thinks the side he's fighting for has already lost.",

Witcher pretty much was a phenomenon in its first season, then they turned it into a piece of shit.

But most of the time he says \"hmpf\".\n\nThere are potions that he drinks, but we don't know why, what they do, and what the differences are, nor how he gets them. And he can sometimes do magic, but forgets about it when it would be really useful.\n\nThe series are a very, very shallow representation of the books that I also found to be rather shallow. At least series-Geralt is cool, because Geralt in the books was a bit of a whiner.\n\nI think I reluctantly finished season 2 and decided to just play the Witcher 3 (game) another time instead.

This is the second\u00a0Transformers\u00a0movie not directed by Michael Bay after 2018\u2019s\u00a0Bumblebee\u00a0(though Bay still produces), and looks to distinguish itself from the fray with its introduction of the robotic animals from the Hasbro franchise.\u00a0Creed II\u00a0director Steven Caple Jr. is at the helm and the movie stars\u00a0In the Heights\u2019\u00a0Anthony Ramos and\u00a0The Deuce\u00a0and\u00a0Judas and the Black Messiah\u2019s\u00a0Dominique Fishback. The pic cost a net $195M co-financed by Skydance.\n\nTransformers:\u00a0Rise of the Beasts\u00a0is tracking strong with Hispanic, Latino and Black audiences stateside and is bound to be fighting over the No. 1 parking space atop the box office charts against Sony Animation\u2019s\u00a0Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u2018s second weekend, both looking at\u00a0$50M-plus. Presales for\u00a0Rise of the Beasts\u00a0are 2.5x ahead of\u00a0Shazam: Fury of the Gods. Spider-Verse\u00a0(Deadline\u2019s review\u00a0here) is a force to be reckoned with, putting up a strong Monday of\u00a0$13M\u00a0and Tuesday of\u00a0$15M\u00a0for a running total of\u00a0$148.7M. Who says competition isn\u2019t good for the marketplace?\n\nWhile\u00a0Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\u2018 start is down from the\u00a0early tracking projections that neared $70M\u00a0a few weeks ago, the pic\u2019s three-day booked at 3,673 theaters will rep a rise from the Friday-Sunday takes of\u00a0Bumblebee\u00a0and\u00a0Transformers: The Last Knight, which posted $21.6M and $44.68M starts, respectively.\u00a0Rise of the Beasts\u00a0will have access to 400 Imax auditoriums and 700 PLF screens as well as 3D showtimes. There is a fan event tonight at 7 p.m., with previews starting Thursday at 3 p.m.\n\nRise of the Beasts\u00a0is releasing in 68 overseas markets beginning with early rollout in Korea on Tuesday, followed by France, Italy and Indonesia today, then Germany, the UK, Mexico, India and Spain through Friday. The only majors not going this week are Australia and Japan, which join on June 22 and August 4, respectively.\n\nChina has been finicky lately, but is a massive market for all things\u00a0Transformers\u00a0and has shown some signs of improvement recently. The movie currently leads presales there for the frame. In the PRC,\u00a0Rise of the Beasts\u00a0could do $50M of the sequel\u2019s $100M offshore number.\n\nComping to the previous\u00a0Transformers\u00a0movie, origins story\u00a0Bumblebee, is a bit tough because the target for that film was a wider demo than the rest of the franchise, and while deservedly praised by critics (91% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) came in lower at its final with $340.8M overseas (unadjusted). Also, that was a Christmas release, whereas the Autobots generally come out to play in summer.\n\nBumblebee\u00a0was an anomaly among\u00a0Transformers\u00a0films among critics, who traditionally loathe the crash-bang-boom of them.\u00a0Rise of the Beasts\u00a0currently counts 57% Rotten on Rotten Tomatoes, which ties with the original 2007 movie as the second-best critical score for the franchise.\n\nThe biggest markets on\u00a0Bumblebee\u00a0were China, the UK, Korea, Mexico and Indonesia. In unadjusted figures,\u00a0Bumblebee\u00a0opened to $57.9M in China and legged out to $170.8M. On\u00a0The Last Knight,\u00a0the biggest offshore territories were China, Korea, Russia, Japan and Germany (Russia, of course, will not factor for\u00a0Rise of the Beasts). Note further that there is heavy competition in Korea this weekend as it\u2019s the sophomore session for local hit\u00a0The Roundup: No Way Out.\n\nThe offshore promotional campaign for the\u00a0Beasts\u00a0has included premieres in Paris, Madrid and Luanping, China. In Beijing, there have been giant statues erected of Optimus Prime and Maximal leader Optimus Primal.\n\nIn the record books, the top global openings for\u00a0Transformers\u00a0movies were 2011\u2019s\u00a0Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon\u00a0($382.4M) and 2014\u2019s\u00a0Transformers: Age of Extinction\u00a0($302.1M) in grosses unadjusted for inflation or currency fluctuations.",

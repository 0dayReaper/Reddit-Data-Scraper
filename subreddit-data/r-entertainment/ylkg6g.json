So it is possible that a Polish traveling fur salesman may have been aware of the name while writing his first short story about The Witcher.",

I'd imagine people in the business know fans won't take kindly to Cavill being replaced and that it'll be an uphill battle. I don't blame anyone for not wanting to step into it. Even if Liam gives an 8/10 performance people will give him a 6/10. Combine that with the reasons Cavill left in the first place and I wouldn't be surprised if we found out they had trouble recasting and had to reach deep.",

And if you think your own ideas are so good then there's no reason not to put them in your adaptation. \n\nOf course adaptation usually can't exactly follow the original material - it's hard to fit a 300 page book in 2 hours of film or whatever. But that might be an explanation for why so many apparently unnecessary changes tend to happen in adaptation.",

The initial attempt at the pilot for the very first episode, they tried to be extremely faithful to the book, and it didn't work. The audience found the Starks cold and unlikeable. So they tweaked it, changed unimportant details from the book so they could introduce each member of the Stark family in a way that showed their personalities and relationships with each other very quickly, and in a way that made them endearing. It worked incredibly well. The first season was a masterpiece of adaptation, showing a keen understanding of the beating heart of the storylines, the themes, the essence and motivations and essential details of every character. It was a rare example of the ideas of the show exceeding the book, mostly because the changes were made working within the material instead of discarding it.\n\nAnd then, of course, we all know how things ended.",

This is why you get a ton of shows that either start out okay and then veer off into unknown territory or just start in the same fantasy world but have a completely different plot despite being marketed as a \"remake.\" Rings of Power, Riverdale (a lot of CW show in general,) recent Disney productions etc.",

So they alter anything they want, however they want, in whatever way they believe will make the most people be be interested enough to get caught in that broad net.\n\nAnd as long as shows like GOT, TWD, and other large scale ones keep living and making money despite their severe flaws, this method of entertainment creation will not change. They consider it worth the risk to butcher the material and to bleed the most from the interest it garners before it's death. Why create something that is true to the origin, and will be beloved by it's fan base for 7 years, when you can make something that infuriates its fan base, but brings in a metric ton of casual semi fans they can milk for money for 4 or 5?",

They look at market trends and sales data, that\u2019s it. Those types of people are political and manipulative but cannot understand art. This is why everything turns formulaic. They see what\u2019s working and standardize it. Somewhere along the way they think they\u2019re geniuses and taht writers and producers can all be replaced and you get shit quality shows like this.",

Agents handle high volumes of talent, focusing on getting them as many auditions and jobs as possible. On the other hand, managers have a handful of clients at most, and spend more time weighing the pros and cons of a project and how it may affect the career of their client. Your agent is like an investor in you, your manager is like your investment broker.\n\nApple TV has had hit after hit on its shows lately, and TV has often proven the key to breaking an actor out of type. My guess is his manager told him it would be a good investment, and it didn\u2019t work out. Sucks for him though, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a bad actor at all.\n\n(I\u2019m an actor with a film and tv agent, so this is my wheelhouse)",

Most people turn away if the headline says \"serial killer that ate people\" . That's enough for people to avoid looking further. But this show shed light on the victims, the circumstances of why it took so long to catch and convict him, and how Jeff was as a person. It's not just about his crimes. This is why you sympathize with the families of these victims now. Before this show, most people didn't know these families either. This happened over the span of a decade about 40 years ago. If people really wanted to know more about Dahmer and his victims, it has been available for public scrutiny for at least 20 years now. So this outcry from social media now, is a bit too late and virtue signaling in a tacky way. Jeffery Dahmer has been dead for years so he's not coming after anyone anymore. Evan Peters is just an actor playing him. He's not the real Dahmer but people want to put the blame on someone for retraumatizing a few family members. Did they ask for your attention and help before this show came out? No. Are they still asking for your attention? No. Why is it your concern now long after this show has ended? Evan can't talk about it anymore because it will hurt the families again? Did they tell him not to talk about it anymore? I'm sure they can't stop a discussion between colleagues about his experience on set. That's what they were all there for. People need to learn to separate reality from the characters the actors play. That's your problem not his or the families.",

But many of the studio creates fell flat on their faces once outside of the studio's protective bubble. \n\nMarvel makes all of their leads into famous actors, but that doesn't mean that are all movie stars. It's like the difference between Kate Winslet's post Titanic experience, and Leo's. Both actors, but one is a legit movie star. The other is a famous actress. Both elevated their popularity due to a gigantic film/studio push. \n\nBased on Tom's non-marvel work, he, like Chris Harmsworth, is no movie star (yet), just very famous actor. And that's alright.",

Didn't realize the toll it took on me until it had wrapped up and had to talk about it in therapy. Acting is fun but can be a bitch. Happy for Tom. Hope his year is enjoyable.",

I didn\u2019t know who he was, looked him up and was really not looking forward to it, and let me say\u2026 this guy is one of the kindest beautiful souls I\u2019ve ever met. He genuinely cared and got to know everyone around him, treated everyone with the utmost respect, and was grateful to anyone who was even remotely in arms reach. \n\nThe entertainment world need more people like this guy. I judged a book by its rockstar cover and was soooooo wrong.",

The actor spent as much as six hours in the makeup chair each day to fully transform into the character. In an interview ahead of the film\u2019s Venice premiere, Fraser shared that his prosthetic suit was \u201ccumbersome, not exactly comfortable,\u201d adding, \u201cThe torso piece was almost like a strait jacket with sleeves that went on, airbrushed by hand, to look identical as would human skin, right down to the hand-punched hair.\u201d",

Beyond this, with the current state of affairs, personal tribulations, and just general need for empathy and comraderie, people keep a lot of tough feelings inside that, while not perfect, a good cry can relieve the pressure of. \n\nI think the problem sometimes is that people don't cry, especially when they need to. Fuck it, writing this comment and just thinking about things in general I've got a solid few tears going down.",

The assault, his subsequent divorce, and the death of his mother launched Fraser into a depression that, combined with his health issues and a backlash within the industry over speaking out against Berk, caused his career to decline.[50][55]\n\n\nDamn!",

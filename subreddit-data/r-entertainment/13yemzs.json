            "comment": "&gt; The fine line between being right and being righteous is at the center of Idan Haguel\u2019s \u201cConcerned Citizen.\u201d **The Tel Aviv-set film follows a young gay man living in a neighborhood that\u2019s supposedly on the upswing who has to question whether his commitment to bettering this increasingly gentrified community is all that selfless \u2014 or whether, in fact, that moniker he uses to describe himself and which gives the film its title is a smokescreen for more unseemly sentiments about his immigrant neighbors.** Haguel\u2019s deft dark comedy is a tight character study of the curdling effects of white guilt and white privilege...\n\n&gt; **When Ben plants a tree on the street right outside of his apartment**, he feels as if he\u2019s helping better the space for all those around. **That is, until he sees from his balcony, two young Black neighbors casually hanging out by the still-fragile tree.** He worries if they keep leaning on it, this added greenery will outright snap, only his pleasant if needlessly abrasive demands go mostly unheeded. **After confronting his Eritrean neighbors outside, he retreats to his cozy apartment and calls the city (anonymously, of course), only to witness soon thereafter how two policemen harass and brutalize one of the men with impunity.**",

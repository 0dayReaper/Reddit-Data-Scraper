Some excerpts:\n\n(Oprah)she said, 'I know you don't feel like you deserve any of this stuff, and you don't \u2014 none of you deserve it,'\" Davis said. \"'But you are worthy of it, and I want you to remember that.'\"\nI think I can see what she\u2019s saying but apparently some took it differently.\n\nIt mentions the first time she gave it away, taxes had to be paid. So this tiktokers experience was when they had decided to cover it\n\n\u201cDavis clarified in a follow-up video that Winfrey was well-intentioned and delivered the monologue after hearing audience members say they felt unworthy. \u201c\n\n\u201cMore than a decade later, she said she still has the vehicle. She also told Insider she keeps in touch with roughly a hundred fellow audience members in a Facebook group\n\"It was my favorite day of my whole life,\" Davis said on TikTok, \"even though I have two kids.\"\n\n\n\nSo it seems like it\u2019s coming from the tiktok users that the \u201cundeserving\u201d was a back handed compliment, but not this one person who was in the audience. Maybe others in the audience had something else to say but based on the quote it seems like it was pleasant, and no hidden tax \nSource for above (While TikTok viewers appreciated this rare, behind-the-scenes glimpse into the legendary talk show and its famous host, some felt it was a back-handed compliment.)",

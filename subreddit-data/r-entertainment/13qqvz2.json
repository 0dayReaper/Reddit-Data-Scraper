With a stacked voice cast I was expecting something better; however, only Timon and pumba were good in my opinion. I rewatched the original  the other night and man it is so amazing. The facial expressions and use of color in the original animated film are a big part of what makes it a classic.\n\nMoreover, how do they take out \"Be Prepared\"?!?! That song needs to be in it. It would have also been nice if they would have utilized the Broadway musical, especially the song \"They Live in You/He Lives in You\".\n\nAlso, if you're going to keep James Earl Jones, who was just too old to carry the part at that time, bring back Jeremy  Irons. He is just as memorable as Jones.",

In the Disney version she learns nothing and ends up marrying a man she doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s a pretty terrible message. \n\nI still love the original movie, but here\u2019s a good [CinemaTherapy video](https://youtu.be/5hkaqlRH6bA) about it.",

Visually they fit that game feel and the game is great. These movies were made to be cartoons. They were fun kids movies when they were. When they bring them to resemble real life they feel goofy. That being said this stuff is fine in plays. I just haven\u2019t enjoyed any of them as movies. Someone apparently does.",

You know the overwhelming amount of people that go to see these films are children and their families right? There are people that actually genuinely love these remakes. If that upsets you then you then sorry but there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.",

Don\u2019t even care about your argument, that\u2019s just a terrible metaphor. Black Ariel would still be a McChicken, she would probably just have a sesame seed bun or something like that. She looks a little different but she would have the same flavor, because the taste is what\u2019s important. In this metaphor flavor would be singing talent. Because that\u2019s what is most important for the role. \n\nThe difference between a white Ariel and a black Ariel is not as significant as you imply through your metaphor. Regardless, if someone were to be mad about anything with this movie, she should probably be one of the last things since it sounds like she is one of the highlights of the film and is an incredible singer, which is why she got the job.",

Maybe some people do but I certainly don\u2019t and I think it\u2019s a waste of energy to spend more that a moment thinking about it. \n\nWith that said, if people don\u2019t want to watch this for whatever reason, that\u2019s fine it doesn\u2019t matter that much. I just think the issues with this movie seem to fall on other aspects rather than the lead actress. To me the bland color pallet and new songs that aren\u2019t great detract me from seeing this in theaters. Probably will catch it on D+ someday though.",

Because while the racists are refusing to support it simply for casting a black Ariel, unfortunately, many non-racists are just not very interested either, for varying reasons. At least in the circles I know. For example, my fiance is a huge fan of the OG cartoon, but she is only sort of interested in this because the other live-action remakes so far have all been just \"okay\" at best. On top of that, we both agree that for this particular movie they probably should have just gone with an actress that resembled the OG cartoon more. And it has nothing to do with her being black, my fiance said it's more her hair that kinda bugs her. I guess the flowing bright red hair of the cartoon was more iconic than her skin color, and now it's these muted, darker dreads that just don't have that same magical appeal. Which I can understand. But apparently she can really sing, so the music should be fantastic. Also Javier Bardem is a really weird choice for Triton, haha.\n\nIn any case, it's going to be an interesting case study for Disney.",

            "comment": "Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d is poised to make a box office splash over Memorial Day weekend. The big-budget remake is projected to earn a mighty $100 million from 4,300 North American theaters in its first three days of release and $120 million to $125 million by Monday\u2019s holiday.\n\nBased on those estimates, it\u2019ll be the fourth movie (and third from Disney) this year to clear the $100 million mark in its debut, following \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d ($146 million), \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\u201d ($118 million) and \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\u201d ($106 million).\n\nRob Marshall directed \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d which looks like it\u2019ll be one of Disney\u2019s more successful live-action adaptations. The studio has revisited classics like \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u2014 all of which cracked $1 billion globally \u2014 as well as the less commercially embraced \u201cMulan\u201d and \u201cDumbo,\u201d to varying degrees of box office glory.\n\nBy comparison, 2019\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d enjoyed a mammoth $191 million debut, 2019\u2019s \u201cDumbo\u201d opened to a tepid $45 million and 2019\u2019s \u201cAladdin\u201d collected $91 million to start. (Apparently, 2019 was a huge year for Disney remakes.) Meanwhile, the first of the studio\u2019s live-action reimaginings in 2017\u2019s \u201cBeaty and the Beast\u201d and 2016\u2019s \u201cJungle Book,\u201d launched with $174 million and $103 million, respectively.\n\n\u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d had a budget close to $250 million, which grew because of unexpected COVID-related production delays and health and safety costs, so it will need to resonate across the globe to turn a profit. The movie lands day-and-date in nearly every key international market, where it\u2019s expected to generate $80 million over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d will take the No. 1 spot on domestic box office charts from Universal\u2019s action-adventure \u201cFast X,\u201d which opened last weekend with an uninspired $67 million. Now in its sophomore outing, the 10th entry in the high-octane franchise is estimated to add $27 million to $30 million over the weekend. \u201cFast X\u201d is faring far better at the global box office with $344 million, including $271 million internationally.\n\nElsewhere at the box office, three comedies are opening and may be settling for scraps. Sony\u2019s R-rated \u201cThe Machine\u201d is tracking to debut to a soft $5 million from 2,300 over the holiday weekend; Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cAbout My Father,\u201d with Sebastian Maniscalco and Robert De Niro, is aiming for $5 million to $6 million from\u00a02,400 locations. Meanwhile, A24\u2019s \u201cYou Hurt My Feelings,\u201d starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and directed by Nicole Holofcener, is targeting $1 million from 900 theaters over the four-day frame.",

I do listen to a lot of podcasts and shows of people I both agree and disagree with. I listen to Bills and I agree when he says Ageism is shitty and older people are sometimes people we should listen to with regard to wisdom... but then he turns around and is AGEIST against Gen Z and Millennials like CRAZY! It's so hypocritical that its hard for me to agree on some points he makes that I do agree with, just because he is such a jerk!",

I always found him to be acerbic, but I was happy at least he brought up a few new angles and pushed back on the PC culture. But -- there's pushing back and then there's being anti PC for the sake of it. Ranting about \"forcing people to gender reassign\"? -- good grief.\n\nI'm guessing Maher just couldn't stay interesting and creative enough for the normal TV audience so now he's supporting conspiracy theories and lame observations that seems like genius for the crowd that could watch Hee Haw for 40 years. He's getting the same demographic as Tucker Carlson I suppose.\n\nHey, a guy has to make a living, right?",

Been to a lot of concerts for a lot of bands that I liked more than Al, but Al is still the best show I've ever seen.  \n\nEven in my little Canadian city it was a full energy LONG performance with constant costume changes.  Not even a hint of him phoning it in.  Super high energy and effort.\n\nAnd it's not just the costume changes it's the total shift in how it acts and performs on stage.  When he did Germs he looked AND acted like Trent Reznor.  Then like a surgeon comes on and not only is he changed into scrubs, he's acting like Madonna at the VMAs in 84.",

Can't explain why, she just does.\n\nWeird Al's plays this song in his set, gets close to the end, stops to rant about something. When he's done with the rant, he says that he forgot where he was in the song so he decides to start it over, and sings like 60% of the song \\*again\\* before remembering where he was initially, where he jumps forward and finishes of the song.\n\nI know it's just a bit (he didn't \\*really\\* forget where he was in the song), but knowing my wife's history with the song, it was the best moment in the concert for me.",

He like...understood that I was trying to say something heartfelt and serious and he was so gracious about it.  I'm tearing up a little just looking back on it. The rest is a blur, rushed by security, but I also got him to sign the only thing I had to write on out of my purse,  my recent allergy test results showing that I'm allergic to literally everything to test for AND IT MADE HIM LAUGH.

I\u2019d guess Weird Al is a member of the AFM as well. Among other things, they\u2019re fighting for better pay with the big streaming services. You can definitely check out more of what the various unions and locals are doing on their site. There are often contract disputes that arise and the union helps individual musicians all the time.",

            "comment": "Weird Al is a special kind of creative genius, in my opinion. If you think about it, the dude doesnt just \"play music\". He found himself a very specific niche/gimmick (for lack of a better word) that didn't have a whole lot of other artists clamoring for an audience, and he turned out to be REALLY fuckin good at it. He gained national recognition,  and rather than turn out to be a 1 trick pony or a flash in the pan, he kept writing really funny, really clever parodies, and stayed successful. Now over 20 years he is still the only name in the \"pop parody\" category that is almost instantly recognizable, and in fact if there even ARE others out there in the parody game they're essentially unknown compared to Al's success. And on top of THAT , over the span of time, he very consistenly put out new parodies that were always funny and always clever  I think writing a parody of an existing song must be pretty difficult given that the lyrics you come up must be funny, must fit the vocals rhythm and melody perfectly, and must fit a particular theme for the song. It's not like writing an original where you have freedom to make it whatever you want. To seebe able to do this well on a a handful of tracks would be impressive. But the man has put out SO MANY in his time and most if not all of them are , at the very least,  clever, if not outright brilliant.\n\nExample; \"The Saga Begins\". Ok so youre gonna write a song based on the Phantom Menace huh? Cool, that'll be a good challenge to fit into a song.  But he picks a song that happens to have a chorus that he can fit a little thing about Anakin and Vader, and have even the rhyme scheme match that of the original, AND managed to perfectly retell the movie to boot! Arguably a perfect parody.\n\n\nEdit: I know , I know. It was a lot more than 20 years ago. Closer to 40. I'm leaving it in there though, as a monument to my foolishness. Pointing and laughing at me is allowed and encouraged.",

Freddie Mercury is hosting a party and the rest of Queen is there. Just as the party is heating up, the other Queen members are all acting responsible and how they have to go home now.\n\n\nIt was so ridiculous to think they portrayed Freddie Mercury as the only one who was partying and somewhat out of control during those days.",

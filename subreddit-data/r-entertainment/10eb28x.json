Not that I condemn his election, but that really was the point where all the racists just lost their shit and started openly coming out of the woodwork in droves.\n\nTrump himself utilized that racist blowback as a central pillar in his campaign.  The only reason he started getting mentioned in political media prior to his 2015 announcement was because he was the leading voice in the 'Birtherism' racist smear-campaign.",

I\u2019m sure a significant amount of his personal wealth is tied up in assorted business ventures. \n\nSure he\u2019s giving up control over his life\u2019s work, but I wonder how important that is to someone like Dr. Dre who is almost 60 years old and likely thinking more about his legacy than wether or not people can put his music in commercials or whatever. \n\nI don\u2019t work in the music industry, and I\u2019m not a lawyer, so I don\u2019t know, but it seems like someone with as much power as him would be able to negotiate contract terms that give him at least a minimal level of control over how his material is used after it\u2019s sold even if only by specifying prohibited uses in the contract. It would free up any of \u201chis own\u201d money or effort that\u2019s being spent on maintaining and enforcing copyrights and licensing, and possibly (likely?) will still net him ongoing royalties.",

The engagement in Magic is increasing, both among new players and old players. In fact, returning players has been one of the most rapidly growing segments during the last few years. What is true is that players have been complaining about product fatigue, but this has not translated to reduced sales or engagement. So we're in an odd situation where some players are complaining loudly about the product, while continuing to buy.",

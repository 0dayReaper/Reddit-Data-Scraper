Grave was a \"safe\" project for Ghibli, in defiance of all logic, because it was based on an existing popular book, and the subject matter made it more or less guaranteed that the movie would make money from schools taking kids on class trips to see it.\n\nTotoro, meanwhile, was a relatively oddball concept from a director who, while not untested, hadn't really had a *smash hit* yet. Cagliostro and Nausicaa did okay, but they didn't do \"give this guy a free pass forever\" well.\n\nSo, what Ghibli did was, when they got funding and licensing and etc to make Grave, they pitched the idea of doing a double feature and making two movies in exchange for a little extra cash. Toho, the studio that was funding them, went \"sure, okay,\" and Ghibli split into Takahata's team working on Grave and Miyazaki's team working on Totoro for the duration of the production.\n\nThis ended up posing a problem, however, when it came time to *release,* because the initial order was Totoro first, Grave second, and... I think you can more or less figure how that went. They flipped it, and then both movies *finally* worked fine for everyone, and now we have modern Ghibli and Miyazaki's lifetime free pass to do literally whatever he wants.",

                    "comment": "I actually find going to the theater cheaper than it's been for years.  For example, cinemark has a loyalty program which lowers all tickets to $9.99.  It costs $9.99 a month and gives you a free ticket every month.  So if you're seeing a movie you can subscribe, get your free ticket, buy another ticket, cancel, and see a movie with 2 people for $20.  \n\nThat's a cheaper date night than dinner or a club by a long shot.",

Then if someone does show up late, you just say something like, \"Sorry, this seat was better than the seat I paid for.\" Then you find another unoccupied seat or leave if there isn't one.\n\nThat's an interesting point on concessions. Technically the theater doesn't have to pay the studio anything for that extra view either because there wasn't a ticket sale.

I typically sit in the back of the theatre because I have a small bladder so I end up watching all the people struggling with their assigned seats. I just look on the website and see which seats are taken and which are open so I can entertain myself watching them get lost or intentionally sit in better seats which are reserved so they have to move five minutes later.\n\nLast movie I saw, I watched a couple sit in some good seats, got settled in with their drinks and snacks, and pulled out their blanket. Then the people who had the seats showed up and the couple had to pack up all their stuff and move to their actual seats.\n\nIf I were to sneak into a movie again like I did many many years ago as a teenager, I'd just take a crappy seat and check the app/website. Then when the movie was starting, I'd just move to the seat that I wanted that was still available.",

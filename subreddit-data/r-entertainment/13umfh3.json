The drink he had at the bar was Gerri\u2019s favorite kind, so seems happy to remember what\u2019s happened and optimistic of the future, untethered to the family business. And ultimately, Kendall\u2019s final shot was the classic Logan boardroom shot from behind of him looking at the water (callbacks!) as if the world is now his boardroom. No one got the top spot but everyone got some version of a fresh start imo",

Shiv will always play second fiddle to Tom in a loveless relationship, Roman goes back to being a playboy with no ambition, and Kendall lost his chance at truly being somebody important. Kendall\u2019s final shot also isn\u2019t a callback to Logan looking over the boardroom. He looks out over the water as the security guard that covered up his murder stands silently in the background. He\u2019ll always be haunted by his past and will never truly be happy",

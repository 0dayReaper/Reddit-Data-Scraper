Anyone can die at any time, again as I know from experience, but Pacino and Deniro know they are gonna die when their children are still young and they did it anyway. Yeah, they'll be rich, but that really doesn't mean anything. Money doesn't replace the father they will never have. They'll grow up watching them in their old movies more than actually knowing them in real life.",

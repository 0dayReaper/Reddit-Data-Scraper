But the posts made me angry thinking, *wait a minute! How often do we see this in a heterosexual relationship and no one treats it the same way!* Do people say it's creepy or gross that some 50+ exec has a 20-year-old girlfriend? Sure. But at the same time people were saying that he liked young men Singer must be a predator made me feel a double standard. The accusations at the time were proven to be false. One high profile accusation was tossed out as it was easy for the defense to not only punch holes in the story but that Singer wasn't even in the same country at the time of the alleged \"sex party\" as he was shooting X2 in Canada. And yes, on that day. There were records he was on set working at that time.\n\n\n\n\nBut then....\n\n\n\n\nBuddy of mine worked on a pilot he directed. Everytime we talked I was so disappointed to hear about how unprofessional Singer was. Like he wasn't even directing. Just... Hanging out. All aloof, in his director's chair fiddling with a guitar, not having answers to questions, not knowing or caring what was going on. Just... Coasting?... And letting others do it. So when I heard the rumors that [Newton Thomas Siegel?] was the one stepping up when Singer was flaking out, I believed them. \n\n\n\n\nThen more accusations. Seemingly more credible. And more sketchiness. Disappointed I ever defended him.",

Lawyer had track record of representing shady clientele. At the time Reddit was like, \"Ok, maybe this is BS but look at him hanging out with young men\" and I felt a double standard.\n\n\n\n\nThat's what I was referring to. In that case production paperwork for X2 showed that Singer was on set the day the accuser claimed Singer approached him at an illicit party in Hawaii.\n\n\n\n\nRegards to the rest... Not blaming anyone but Singer. The Usual Suspects was one of my all time favorite films. Now I've got a lot of reconciling to do.",

The extradition requires.. \n\n&gt; that there is sufficient admissible evidence to justify bringing the wanted person to trial had the person committed the charged acts in Israel.\n\nSo the evidence has to be strong enough to be admissible not only in American court but Israeli court as well. I\u2019m not a lawyer but I can imagine there\u2019s sone gotchas and pitfalls in the overlap. \n\n&gt; The Minister of Justice must then decide whether to grant the extradition request.\n\nSo it\u2019s still up to one person/office to make the decision. That\u2019s just one person to influence/bribe. Just saying. Even if you meet all conditions it\u2019s not automatic. \n\n&gt; An Israeli national may not be extradited except for an offense committed prior to becoming a national.\n\nSo if Brian Singer was a Israeli citizen before he committed the crime there is no way to extradite him. Period. Even if it\u2019s clear he did it. Even if everyone knows he did it. No extradition. End of legal argument. \n\n&gt; The offense must be a criminal offense under the laws of the requesting state and an extradition offense under Israeli law.\n\nThis is also important. So if Bryan singer is accused and charged in America with something there must be a corresponding law in Israel that is sever enough to warrant extradition. No idea what that could be because I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d be charged with but if Israel doesn\u2019t consider the crime to be worthy of the effort of extradition he won\u2019t go. Again, even if it\u2019s pretty clear he dit it. \n\nAll that said, as far as I know no charges have been brought against him. No evidence exists against him. Just accusations. Im not saying they are lying or anything like that just that they\u2019re doesn\u2019t seem to be enough evidence to warrant even a court trial let alone an international request for extradition.  \n\n&gt; Every request must be accompanied by evidence showing a prima facie case against the offender.\n\nPrima facie means that there is proof that exists that if taken as fact, without contradiction, will allow a fact finder to justify a verdict in that direction. So if they didn\u2019t allow a defense at all the evidence would be enough to justify a conviction. If all they have is an accusation by the wronged party it\u2019s unlikely to be enough to justify a conviction on its own. Just being accused of a crime isn\u2019t enough to justify conviction. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s a completely non-lawyers interpretation of a summary of a DOJ document. Point is almost every line suggests an extradition is unlikely especially if Singer was a citizen before the incident.",

Basically being a pimp is illegal, human trafficking is very illegal, being a John is illegal.

Israel is a weird mix but culturally it\u2019s closer to Norway than Arab countries when it comes to this (to an extent obviously. It\u2019s its own thing)",

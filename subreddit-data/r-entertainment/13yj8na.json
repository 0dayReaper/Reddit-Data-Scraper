Never do sequels, they\u2019re never as good as the original \n3. Always have a rapper in your movie\n4. Start putting other muscular action stars in your movie to boost the franchise\n5. Have issues with other muscular action stars because you\u2019re insecure and feel like they\u2019re stealing the spotlight from you\n6. Make-up with other muscular action stars because Family\n7. Immediately start beefing again with other muscular action stars again after attempting to reconcile, because you take things way to seriously\n8.  If a likable character died in a previous movie, pretend like it never happened, and keep putting him in all the following movies with no explanation or acknowledgement, who cares, it\u2019s just a movie, nobody takes it seriously \n9.  Accuse other actors not taking these movies as seriously as you\n10.  Always do sequels, the more the merrier\n11. Only movies 5-7 in the franchise need to be good, all the rest can be mediocre or complete trash",

When they brought in the Rock he had a clause in his contract about how many times he could get hit in a fight and how he wasn't allowed to lose a fight outside of certain situations. After realizing it was an option for contracts like that Diesel, Walker, and some of the other cast members had their own contracts updated. Apparently it made filming Fast 6 a nightmare because they had to dance around basically the entire main cast not being allowed to lose a fight or get hit too many times. That's why they changed things up and started having people getting beaten in car crashes and through something other than fist fights.",

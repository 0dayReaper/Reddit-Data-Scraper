Every fucking judge, official, proposition, attorney, school board yokel, especially the weird double speak shit, and cross reference it with who is supporting each item on Democrat/Republican sites. I can vote as methodically as a brain surgeon.\n\nWhen I\u2019m done, I drive it over to the registrar of voters and drop it off.\n\nI even get a sticker.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the Gold!!\n\nEdit 2: \u201cagain\u201d",

Conservatives have an advantage despite this because so many people who lean left do not vote.  As such conservatives have been trying to make voting more difficult for years by claiming widespread voter fraud. They do this despite a lack of hard evidence as lower turnout benefits them. Mail in ballots would obviously make it much easier for everyone to vote, hurting the election prospects for Republicans should it happen.\n\nRepublicans also have an advantage in how districts are divided up, etc. Trying to keep this simple though.",

While the opinions and actions of celebs may mean little to you or I, that isn't the case for a lot of people. Celebrity endorsements definitely impact the opinions and views for many of their fans.

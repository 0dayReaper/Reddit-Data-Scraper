Bambi, Little Mermaid, Aristocats, Moana; it\u2019s all the same to them as long as they\u2019re entertained. Honestly I think these movies are made for the parents who want their kids to relive the theatrical experiences of their childhood.",

If they want to make money on their Little Mermaid property, they have to make a new movie and make it at the box office because movies just don't have the revenue streams they used to.",

I knew Halle Bailey was talented, but I was worried about all of the other factors, especially since I've not cared for most any of the other live actions I've seen (save for Aladdin). I'm not going to spoil it, but they did add some depth to Prince Eric's story, and in turn, to his romance with Ariel. The two actors' chemistry was also really great. And this one will never replace the animated version, but I think it's a worthy retelling. If you have Disney+, I suggest at least giving it a try when it's streaming.",

Not to mention it can promote a stigma that the live action is better and more mature than animation purely because of the \"up to date\" changes made in the new one. One main exception would be the giant extinct ape they turned King Louie into from the Jungle Book remake because orangutans aren't from India, that was amazing. But with the live action stuff becoming such a big and annoying trend in recent times, I see little point in making remakes that will automatically be inferior due to the different visuals alone.

Halle Bailey (a Black girl) being cast as Ariel. They wanted to see Ariel as she was in the 1989 version. They are nostalgic for the old version and simply refuse this new version on principle. \n2. Bad CGI (fair). I saw the movie and I wasn\u2019t that bothered by it because the movie is mostly on land anyway. Sebastian &amp; Flounder were okay. They could\u2019ve been much better. However, I didn\u2019t care much for the animal characters in the original and I wasn\u2019t attached to their animated or live-action versions. \n3. They hate Disney\u2019s remakes in general and are tired of them. They want more original movies that are good.",

Why on earth would you make a fantastical fairy tale musical movie with color grading that looks  so grey and miserable?? To be fair most of the Ad/Pub for that movie has been surrounding like one sequence, but I don't get why you'd want to make that sequence, arguably the most famous song in the movie, so unenjoyable to look at. Like I said there's a reason it works well in animation, in my opinion partially because the actual ocean floor doesn't look like a fairy tale. You're telling me we can have talking fish, but not a nice looking underwater world? I don't even care about the casting choices whatsoever, it just doesn't look like it would be fun.\n\nETA: I just read a review that specifically notes the actual movie is more bright and colorful than the trailers made it out to be! I'm a bit more tempted to watch it, but I think the Ad/Pub team really did it dirty.",

Under the Sea was especially beautiful, and the character designs of Ariel\u2019s sisters were stunning. It wasn\u2019t better than the original, but it wasn\u2019t like a Lion King situation where they were so worried about photorealism that they made everything bland. \n\nI feel the same way as you about live action remakes, so I wish this one didn\u2019t exist, but if it has to exist, it\u2019s at least a beautiful movie with good storytelling. The added songs were really good too. In fact, I wish both the new songs had had reprises because I liked them so much and I could imagine a lot of storytelling possibilities with them.",

If you bank on nostalgia and make a giant change on a character that is arguably one of the most popular red headed characters children identify with, you aren\u2019t going to get the same allure with parents without kids who want to embrace said nostalgia alienating a sizable demographic.\n\n2.  Yes, certain countries don\u2019t really identify with black leads.  China being more so notable and Japan as well.  Sure it\u2019s wrong but it\u2019s also a known fact ahead of time so you can\u2019t really be surprised when factoring in your grossing estimates.\n\n3.  Fatigue:  it seems now a days the thing to do is reboot something nostalgic but change it either on race or gender.  It\u2019s lazy writing.  There is a lot of other ways to still have a movie be within a certain piece of arts universe while creating new story lines and characters to support and identify with. You can make a new kingdom, maybe Ariel is queen now and this is a visiting princess from another tribe.  Maybe it\u2019s not Ariel at all.  Miles Morales is a popular spider Man, he has his own story and people identified with it.  Ignoring historical precedent from Hollywood previously white washing things, it\u2019s taken a hard turn.  In todays climate if we took a piece of African mythology and casted a white person in it, it would be a massive shit storm with the media crucifying them.  As they rightfully should be.  However changing Nordic mythology or even straight up changing the race of an actual historical person and calling it a documentary does not receive the same reactions.  Actually if you discuss it you are called racist immediately, hence fatigue.",

They tried to make a nostalgic cash-grab that didn\u2019t meaningfully change up the formula from the original movie\u2026 except when it came to the main character, who was race-swapped. Which is fine, I\u2019m not inherently against that, but strictly speaking, you\u2019ve taken a very important element to which people have become emotionally attached over the course of several decades, and changed it. Kind of defeats the purpose of playing to nostalgia, doesn\u2019t it? Disney should\u2019ve either done a radically different take on the material to begin with, which would have given them more license to cast new versions of the characters who didn\u2019t necessarily resemble their animated counterparts, or else made a true beat-for-beat remake of the original - including an actress who more closely resembled the original Ariel.\n\nIf we can\u2019t honestly discuss this without being accused of racism, then the studios should be prepared to continue losing money on this sort of movie in the future!\n\n(And before anyone brings this up, Miles Morales as Spider-Man doesn\u2019t count as race-swapping in the same way, because he\u2019s a whole new character who has taken up the mantle of Spider-Man. Peter Parker still exists within the universe of his movie.)",

They rejected Halle Bailley, even though reviewers I trust say she did a great job.\n\nIt\u2019s an unfortunate reality that Disney will have to accept moving forward.\n\nDisclaimer: I don\u2019t have an issue with the race-swap.

Of course, we also live in the rural south and it rained the whole weekend.\n\nIt was pretty good for a remake.  Under the Sea was a terrible remix.  It was slower and a boring scene until the last 20 seconds of the song.  A lot of the casting seemed off.  Great actors but it made things more gloomy.  Triton\u2019s costuming  looked straight up Aquaman to me &amp; Ursula didn\u2019t look scary.  Also the 3 minute shipwrecks because Humans are littering and trying to make it a human v mermaid storyline was unnecessary.  I don\u2019t even know what the purposes of the sisters being in the movie wasx \n\nDid think they did a good job of showing the main characters actually had stuff in common.  And the Scuttle song was a bop and kiss the girl part was best well done.  I thought both Ariel and the casting for Ursula as a human were great as was the butler guy/servant to Eric. \n\nBut it was missing the magic and some storylines pieces got missed even though the movie was 2 hours.",

It's not racist to cast roles appropriately to fit the characters as they are intended (I'm looking at you \"Rings of Power\").",

He received a second ASC nomination for his work on Netflix\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II drama\u00a0The Crown, and a second Emmy nomination for BBC miniseries\u00a0Sherlock. His latest work includes HBO\u2019s\u00a0Game of Thrones\u00a0prequel,\u00a0House of the Dragon.\n\nIn the upcoming movie, Tom Hardy is returning as Marvel antagonist Venom and Kelly Marcel (who worked as a scribe on\u00a0Venom\u00a0and\u00a0Venom: Let There be Carnage) will be making her directorial debut. Marcel wrote the screenplay from a story that she co-wrote with Hardy.\n\nWagner isn\u2019t completely new to the franchise. The German DP is credited as an additional cinematographer on 2021\u2019s\u00a0Let There Be Carnage,\u00a0which was helmed by Andy Serkis.",

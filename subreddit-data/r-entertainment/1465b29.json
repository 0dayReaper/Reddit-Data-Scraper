You missed the point of BotW completely. \n\nZelda starts the flashbacks struggling with her destiny, overcome with doubt, and desperate to be more than the role that has been defined her whole life. She spends the story hunting for a way to unlock her power and feeling helpless and let down at every turn. \n\nMostly, she resents Link and his steadfast confidence in his path when compared to the uncertainty she feels from her own. But then, she learns from his strength and his courage and when the Calamity happens and everything is at its darkest, she finds her power defending Link the way he always defended her.\n\nShe then sends him to heal from his wounds and takes the burden of containing the Calamity inside Hyrule castle all by herself for 100 years. She's basically telling Link that she's got this until he's healed and ready.\n\nFinally, when freed from the castle, she confidently faces the Calamity and banishes it with her own power, now fully able to believe in her own strength.\n\nShe's even more strong, bold, and brave in the sequel and makes some incredibly courageous choices to help Link save Hyrule.",

Reminds me of a few relationships I had. \n\nAlso that cutscenes where she tears down the walls she has been building all this time and just collapses into links arms. So good.",

I was actually intrigued by her as a character just from reading it. I don\u2019t think the cutscenes were fantastic, but Zelda has never been as human as she was in BOTW, and I think that was worth it, even if the execution was flawed.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, we\u2019ve had other great Zeldas, Tetra probably being the best. But I\u2019m glad they tried something new for BOTW",

I really wish they\u2019d go with a more serious animation style \u2014 I feel like something Ghibli-esque would be fantastic for giving it a little bit of a lighthearted feel while also having enough range to capture the beauty and seriousness that Zelda brings with it. Or even live-action if that kind of animation style isn\u2019t marketable enough.\n\nBut this definitely gives me Teen Titans vibes, and I think they\u2019ll end up saying the goal is to get younger kids interested in the franchise, not to make longtime fans happy. Which blows, but hopefully it\u2019ll open doors later on for different styles of content.",

Hell one of the more lighthearted titles people keep saying could be done for a kids movie (WW) ends with &gt;! The king choosing to drown himself with Hyrule as penance !&lt; \n\nLoZ has some silly moments but overall it\u2019s a darker series than Mario. I can\u2019t imagine Achemans, Wallmasters, Floormasters, Redeads, Dead Hands, or Gloom Hands being in an Illumination film personally let alone a movie geared towards kids which are what Illumination does.",

Movie's success, it looks like another Nintendo IP could be making the transition to the big screen.\n\nAccording to well-informed film critic Jeff Sneider, Universal and Illumination are close to closing a \"big deal\" with Nintendo to adapt the Legend of Zelda.\n\nStating he doesn't believe this news to be a huge surprise, Sneider told\u00a0The Hot Mic Podcast\u00a0\"Zelda is looking like the next big Illumination x Nintendo franchise\".\n\nThis adaptation clearly won't come cheap, however, with Sneider stating its \"going to cost Universal a pretty penny\". This is something the critic attributed to the success of the Super Mario Bros. Movie (which is now the\u00a0biggest video game adaptation ever, and the highest grossing movie this year so far).\n\n\"Nintendo kind of knows its worth at this point, but yeah, I'm told that is now going to be a reality,\" he elaborated.\n\nSo, who would we cast as The Legend of Zelda's movie counterparts? The internet has had some ideas, with my favourite so far imagining a Goron voiced by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson with a Queen soundtrack.\n\nAnother has suggested Adam Sandler as Ganon, with Tom Holland as Link (although, in my opinion, Link should remain silent).\n\nWe had a lot of fun mulling over ideas for other characters during our news chat this morning, with Tom giving a top notch suggestion of Aquaman's Jason Momoa as the beloved Zora, Prince Sidon. He is involved with the\u00a0upcoming Minecraft adaptation, after all, so we already know he is game for video game adaptations.",

Mario is super goofy, so I can excuse the Beastie Boys and Aha in the soundtrack, but with a series like Zelda, I hope they're not going to put We Are The Champions when the 4 Champions are introduced (in a hypothetical BotW-inspired movie).\n\nNintendo soundtracks are amazing, and the included songs from Mario in the new movie were miles better than the licensed songs. Really hope they'll take the feedback.",

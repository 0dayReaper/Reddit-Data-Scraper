Their recent Norman Lear specials, featuring one-off episode remakes of sitcoms that originally aired ON CBS, have been a big hit.\n\nWhoever's in charge of specials at CBS (ex: Jack Sussman, EVP of Specials, Music &amp; Live Events at CBS Entertainment) are f*cking clueless. If I was him, I'd be re-airing all the old Garfield specials (like ABC did with the Peanuts) since parent company Paramount now owns them all and even re-acquire the TV rights to the 1988 Pee-wee's Playhouse Christmas special. I mean, that's your history and heritage right there. Own it and celebrate it.",

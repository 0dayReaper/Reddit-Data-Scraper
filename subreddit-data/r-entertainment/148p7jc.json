            "comment": "She very clearly states in the article that the role wasn't important _for her_. As in for her career or for personal life. She's not commenting on the influence of the franchise. Also, the comparison to Dickens isn't random. She toured a one-woman play called Dickens Women. An hour or more on stage that's all her solo, doing multiple characters from Dickens' world, is way more challenging for an actor than the bit part she had in Potter. That's the comparison she was drawing, probably to a British journalist since she clearly took for granted that they're familiar with her legendary career without having it spoonfed. As the article notes, she's widely considered a national treasure. (Which is not wrong. That woman is hilarious, god bless her.)",

It's absolutely fun and enjoyable, but I doubt anyone went home from work perplexed as to their character's motivation.\n\nLots of the cast have said they did it because the kids in their family strong armed them, or the money was good, or they thought it would be a fun and easy shoot.\n\nI do wish people on this thread would stop disagreeing with Brits about what she meant, when it is something that is absolutely typical for us to say. \"It's hardly Dickens\" is a common British idiom expressing that something isn't challenging. Most of us over here have said it on numerous occasions about both films and books, way before Harry Potter was even written. \n\nOn this occasion, it has zero to do with MM being in a one woman Dickens play. That is merely coincidence in this instance.",

I don\u2019t believe the studio would\u2019ve brought back Margolyes, nor would she have agreed, just to essentially be an extra. Sprout ends up having only one line of dialogue in the film. She says, \u201cOh, come on, what\u2018s the matter with you?\u201d to a student in the Great Hall, while her back is to the camera. It\u2019s not even clear who speaks the line unless you\u2019re familiar with Margolyes\u2019 voice. \n\nI believe Margolyes as Sprout was filmed casting the spells, just as McGonagal, Slughorn, and Flitwick were - but she was cut for timing purposes. During the scene where the professors cast enchantments to protect Hogwarts, the same spells being cast are shown to be emerging from Sprouts\u2019 greenhouse on the castle grounds. It was inevitably her, but I believe the shot showing her as the spell-caster was cut. \n\nAnother instance Sprout may have been cut was when her vines attack and bring down the charging giants at the beginning of the battle. For a viewer it\u2019s difficult to make out what\u2019s happening, as it almost seems like animated ropes appear from nowhere. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Sprout was filmed casting spells enchanting the plants, but again, cut from the film. \n\nI\u2019d love for Margolyes herself to be asked if any scenes of hers had been cut, as I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have some thoughts!\n\nEDIT: Margolyes\u2019 autobiography states she was let go from the Deathly Hallows production 9 days into her 12-day contract. In particular, it seems the production wanted to replace Sprout with Molly Weasley in the enchantment of Hogwarts scene. I speculate this was meant to give Molly more of a role in the film, as outside of that, Molly has no meaningful scene until she fights Bellatrix - her only line in the film would\u2019ve been \u201cNot my daughter, you bitch.\u201d",

Written in one of her many extended canon essays and written exactly like it would\u2019ve if it was in the books. It\u2019s a joke! Laugh! It can\u2019t be too hard to get, it\u2019s a children\u2019s book series. \n\n3. This was a detail about the etymology of the name Voldemort. In French, the word \"mort\" is also pronounced with a silent \"t\" and means \"death.\" The French phrase \"vol de mort\" means \"flight of death.\" She didn\u2019t retcon the name, she said that it technically ended with a silent \u201ct.\u201d \n\n4. And now we circle back to my above comment, saying how Cursed Child is barely even canon, since, once again, both the author and the central brand refuse to acknowledge it other than to sell tickets! But you definitely didn\u2019t know that that detail was from Cursed Child, because you just read whatever crap headline you come across on this app and believe everything you see! Hey look, gullible is written on the ceiling!",

If you reread it is an adult you would probably find out it does not hold up as well as you remember. Everybody gets nostalgic goggles for s*** that was popular when they were 10 years old.

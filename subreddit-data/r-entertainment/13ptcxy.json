            "comment": "In a seismic development for the indie film sector, bond companies are refusing to insure movies ahead of a potential\u00a0SAG-AFTRA strike from July 1.\n\nThis eventuality has been bubbling for a little while but the first known casualty of this is a high-profile case. Oscar winner Pawel Pawlikowski\u2019s\u00a0The Island, set to star Oscar winner\u00a0Joaquin Phoenix\u00a0(Joker) and Oscar nominee Rooney Mara (Carol), was due to get underway this month with the actors on location in Spain and ready to roll.\n\nHowever, we understand threat of a potential SAG-AFTRA strike \u2014 on top of the ongoing\u00a0WGA strike\u00a0and potential DGA action \u2014 has spooked bond companies and\u00a0The Island\u00a0filmmakers were told on the eve of shoot that the movie couldn\u2019t be insured, leading to their two stars (both SAG-AFTRA members) having to return home, and the project being put on hold until further notice.\n\nWe understand talent, financiers and producers remain fully committed to the project but when it can start up again remains to be seen.\n\nPartners on the anticipated film include producers Tanya Seghatchian (The Power Of The Dog) and John Woodward (Kaos), FilmNation, WME Independent, Vision Distribution and Wildside. Oscar winner Pawlikowski is known for movies including\u00a0Cold War,\u00a0Ida\u00a0and\u00a0My Summer Of Love.\n\nHis latest movie was set to be bonded by the industry\u2019s largest indie guarantor, Film Finances Inc (FFI). The filmmakers tried other companies but to no avail. We\u2019ve reached out to FFI but the company declined to comment.\n\nThis is a major headache for those involved in this particular production, but also sector-wide. It poses the real possibility that very few independent films of scale will be able to get off the ground in coming months due to the uncertainty. It\u2019s ironic that the impact won\u2019t be felt much by AMPTP members given that studios can self-bond.\n\nOne indie financier told us: \u201cThis issue has arisen on other projects and until we have clarity on the SAG-AFTRA situation, which is unlikely for the next month, then the problem will remain\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s another unpleasant jolt after bonding for indie films disappeared during Covid when insurers wouldn\u2019t take on pandemic risk and banks wouldn\u2019t lend without a bond. It\u2019s been estimated that as many as 400 projects fell away in 2020-2021. Producers turned to private equity, contingency fees and other workarounds but that gets harder the bigger the budget and indie projects, say, north of $10-$15M often require additional financing.\n\nAs with Covid, costs would rise if there\u2019s a strike and many producers can\u2019t take that on.\u00a0If not, they\u2019re looking to\u00a0projects starting much later in the year or beyond.\u00a0The risk there is that they\u2019d lose cast and/or a director already locked in for a particular window with a hard out.\n\nSAG-AFTRA, which reps more than 160,000 entertainment and media professionals, last week announced that both its negotiating committee and National Board had unanimously agreed to authorize a strike ahead of contract negotiations with the AMPTP beginning on June 7. The guild\u2019s current contract expires on June 30.\n\nWe hear that multiple bond companies are now reluctant to insure any sizeable movies whose shoot bleeds into this period.\n\nMeanwhile, the writers\u2019 strike which began on May 2 has no end in sight as negotiations between producers and the WGA are at a stalemate.\u00a0To date, TV productions have been targeted for picketing, with many being halted. Lionsgate\u2019s\u00a0Good Fortune\u00a0is among very few films that have had to stop during production.\n\nAhead of the ongoing Cannes Film Market, there was unease from financiers, sales companies, creatives and publicists about announcing projects amid a strike. In the end, dozens were announced and deals have been done, but the shadow of industrial action is starting to loom ever larger over the film sector.\n\nStrikes are designed to create short term pain in the hope of long-term change for the better. The unions are showing a united front so far and their combined approach is being increasingly felt.\n\nThe Island\u00a0is loosely based on a true story and centers on an American couple who turn their backs on civilization to build a secluded paradise on a deserted island, where they decide to live off the land. But Eden proves difficult to pull off, particularly after a European countess finds out about their plans and arrives with her two lovers planning to take over the island and build a luxury hotel.",

                                    "comment": "What u/ElGranQuesoRojo said. The Flash TV show covered the Multiverse as early as 2015. It and many other shows had frequent crossovers culminating in 2019 with their adaptation of Crisis on Infinite Earths. Brandon Routh\u2019s Superman was there. Grant Gustin\u2019s Flash met both John Wesley Shipp\u2019s (90s series, also plays Henry Allen and Jay Garrick in the modern show) and Ezra Miller\u2019s. The former even died taking his place to save the Multiverse like his comics counterpart. DC TV basically did first on a lower budget what the MCU did later. DC Film is just so behind and messed up. \n\nEven worse is that Flash has more of a history with the Multiverse than Spider-Man. Yeah there was Spider-Wars in the 90s animated series and the Shattered Dimensions game (loved both, they were great) but otherwise the Spider-Verse is really new. It was Barry Allen who first discovered and regularly traveled through the Multiverse in comics after Flash of Two Worlds in the 60s where he met the Golden Age Flash, Jay Garrick, his predecessor. The Multiverse is also generally more naturally connected to his powers and lore. The shows took advantage of that but the films couldn\u2019t until now. \n\nJames Gunn is right that the DCU needs to be unified in Film and TV going forward after a clean slate. So much wasted potential in the past decade that set things back. This film is doing a loose adaptation of a story that\u2019s already been adapted twice, by an excellent animated movie and the TV show.",

The parents applied for an order of protection as they felt Takota was being 'groomed' by Ezra.  \n* A mother and her twelve-year-old child were granted a temporary harassment prevention order against Miller in Massachusetts after they said that Miller threatened the woman's family and showed inappropriate behavior towards the child, \"pestering\" the child by \"uncomfortably\" touching the child's hips.  \n* A mother with three children was staying at Ezra's Vermont farm.  Witnesses saw people smoking marijuana in front of the children in rooms without proper ventilation, including a witness stating that he \"saw Miller blow marijuana smoke in the baby's face and use their arm to waft more smoke in the baby's direction.\"  \n* Miller was charged with felony burglary in Stamford, Vermont, stemming from what the police report indicated was theft of bottles of alcohol from a private home\n\nThat's just the stuff that's gone public.",

I can definitely see them doing that for simplicity. \n\nBut the original Morrison run it's based on did feature Tim as Robin and Dick came in later. The former was Damian's rival or bickering brother while the latter was more the mentor older brother he looked up to. They not only removed Tim but gave those traits to Dick. This time, I hope they emphasize the big bro kind of relationship instead. Interesting thing to note is that Dick is Batman in the actual Morrison Batman &amp; Robin run with Damian as his Robin.\n\nJason seems like an easy addition. He doesn't need to have been Robin long and he could have just been killed fairly recently. That would put more pressure and drama for Bruce to take Damian in. Then Jason can come back as Red Hood in a sequel.",

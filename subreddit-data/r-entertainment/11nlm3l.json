Much like the \"Best Plumber in Philadelphia\" award for the Philadelphia Association of Plumbers is *probably* not going to the actual best plumber in Philadelphia, instead going to either some well-known plumber who is retiring as a lifetime achievement award or to some guy who greased palms, the Academy doesn't really reward quality. Rather, the Academy does what it needs to do to pump up the film industry, which has always had an inferiority complex about it being \"true art\".\n\nFor that very reason, they don't reward action flicks, however well made. In the eyes of the academy, the huge box office is reward enough. They don't need to boost it, and they don't want to try and pretend that it's \"art\", even when it is. You and I may disagree, in that the fight choreography from something like [The Legend of Drunken Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwDU3IOBEIk) is art in the most classical sense of the term. You and I may even be right that such art should be honored by an award that is ostensibly dedicated to rewarding \"art\" in film.\n\nBut whether we are right is beside the point, because rewarding artistry is not the point of the Academy Awards. The point of the Academy Awards is so a bunch of movie creators can slap themselves on the back about how artistic they are, which is not the same thing.",

You have more than the performers and choreographers, you also have the director,  editor and others putting it all together on screen, creating the rigs/pulleys/pyro, getting the right angles for dramatic effect, obscuring the face just enough to fool the audience and making it all seamless for audiences.",

If Tom Cruise gets COVID, the entire production shuts down because you can't continue without him, and no one gets paid.\n\nSo while it's great that there are insurance clauses where the end result is increased safety for the stunt performers, let's not pretend that the insurance companies or the studios care for much more than their bottom line.  If there's an oscars category for stunts (which there by increases marketability and ad revenue for said oscar winners), it's not going to be long until producers are throwing enough money at a movie to go around or change existing insurance policies.",

Again on YouTube where any smuck could go out and jump off a building with no wires I could see there being problems but not at the level of the Oscars. Inevitably over the next 100 years it would happen at least once but anybody willing to risk at that for an award was probably going to risk it anyway.

Other than cgi I feel action is the most expensive component of a film and sometimes still the most expensive. Everything everywhere all at once is an indie film expected to do well this year and while it didn't shy away from action at all there was still nothing in it that I feel like could come close to winning an award like this because they simply didn't have the budget for it. I don't see much chance of a small budget production ever thinking they could compete with John wick or top gun and thinking their chances were good enough to gamble a bunch of risks. But then again I can think of at least one film I can think of that might fit your description: hardcore henry. It was shot in Russia to get around a lot of safety requirements and made super cheap and it's basically all action and stunts. So idk its definitely complicated and maybe to be eligible for the award certain safety and oversight requirements being required would be nice but at the end of the day I still personally feel like we should find some way to award these people.",

Document how the production took the correct safety measures for their stuntmen, and the award would go to those productions that went above and beyond what's required for stunts.\n\nIf we had an Oscar award that celebrated safety on a set, then maybe more producers will focus on that instead of scrimping.  It would also allow stuntmen, most likely stunt coordinators, to win Oscars on their work based on how they keep their stuntmen safe rather than risking their lives.",

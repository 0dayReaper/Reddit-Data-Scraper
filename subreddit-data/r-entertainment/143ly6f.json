Limits my choices of frames/manufacturers as well.  \n\nNeither Warby Parker or Zenni can make glasses in my prescription (which with Zenni\u2019s tagline being \u201cEyewear for Everyone\u201d is absolutely infuriating).  \n\nZenni at least was polite about it.  Got an apologetic email from them.  The people at the Warby Parker store were rather condescending.  They, as a brand, are dead to me now.",

Their photo was nothing like the glasses I got and they refused to pay for my return shipping (though they gave me store credit back).\n\nSucks needing glasses though it sounds like your case is even worse.\n\nHopefully the ar/vr headsets can correct vision even someday.  At least you can use the oculus quest line now since you should be able to wear regular eyeglasses with them.  The upcoming quest 3 line pancake lenses look huge so I wonder if they could even accommodate your blank size.  Hopefully.",

Except for issues with fogging (less so on the index, with a integrated fan attachment for the front cover), they work well enough with glasses (thank goodness).\n\nThe oculus is really nice, but I just can\u2019t bring myself to support Facebook/Meta.   :-/",

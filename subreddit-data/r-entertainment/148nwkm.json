            "comment": "\"I had two dreams about him after he died. I dont remember the first one all that well but it was about meetin him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. But the second one it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin through the mountains of a night. Goin through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin. Never said nothin. He just rode on past and he had this blanket wrapped around him and he had his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. About the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was goin on ahead and that he was fixin to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up.\u201d \n\n\nA rare breed. Literature won't be the same without him. A legacy greater than most could aspire to. Rest in Peace McCarthy, I hope you got all you wanted out of this life.",

He is an old man now just like his father was and soon he will join him in death (waiting for him with a fixed fire in the dark) and the worries of life are now beyond pointless.\n\nOnly letting go of understanding and having hope makes any sense now.\n\nA lot of people I don't think realize the title of the novel/film comes from this final passage/scene and it's not necessarily just about \"getting too old for the world\".",

His warped, but sharply perceptive mind is what made him terrifying.",

I only really get that when a story means something to me, although I have to confess that I really do not understand large parts of Blood Meridian. The more poetic parts, the waxing lyricals, the odes to bigger themes. I feel almost dyslexic when reading them. They elicit confusion and regret on my part and I can't seem to ever grow from this.",

But for the most part, he is the definition of a writer who likes to say things without literally saying them.\n\nI tried reading Blood Meridian the first time and prose was just too much to digest. Felt like I need to pop a bunch of Adderall to keep up with \"what he is saying\" and \"what he IS saying\". \n\nI quit it and moved on to No Country For Old Man a year later, which I thought was a way easier read. Than the movie came out and I loved it, so I went back to Blood Meridian (which IMO is his masterpieces) and I took my time with it and finally the novel and imagery started to feel in sequence and the movie reel in my mind created by words started smoothly roll.\n\nTo me, Blood Meridian is most enjoyed on a 2nd or 3rd read.\n\nThat's when the depth of the prose mixed in with how descriptive he is with his imagery doesn't feel like drinking from a fire hose and the things start sticking out and slowing down. \n\nThe 2nd time I read Blood Meridian really felt like it was the first true time I read Blood Meridian.",

In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.\"",

He really captures what it's like to live these people's lives.\n\nThe Heavenly Table's main plot is about three brothers in the early 1900s south, who have done nothing but work for scraps with their father their entire lives.  When their father dies, spurned on by pulp western novels, they embark on a spree of murder and robbery to the north.  There are also A LOT of subplots that all eventually cross over and weave together, much like The Devil All the Time.\n\nI can't recommend those two books hard enough.",

And also was on set as a producer or advisor for all the films he made in general.\n\nSo it was literally quite him, which is what I'm referring to as he was supposed to write the screenplay and be a part of making *Blood Meridian* just like every other film.\n\nWith, *No Country for Old Men*, it helped a ton when you have the genius Cohen brothers asking him if they could do it. The bigger help was that NCFOM was originally written as a screenplay, hence, why it reads so much like one. So Cohen brothers + Cormac's blueprint + Cormac advising. NCFOM was written to be a movie (figuratively &amp; literally).\n\nMost of his works actually didn't translate to film all that well and I thought were very underwhelming. It's very difficult to turn his prose into a film without losing it's core.\n\nI thought all of them aside from *Sunset Limited* (a written play, centered in a single place, a kitchen) and *No Country For Old Men* (originally a screenplay turned novel) were the only two that really translated to film. *The Road*, *All The Pretty Horses*, *Child of God*, and *The Counselor* all were duds when it came to translating to the big screen IMO.",

Great book.\n\nBlood Meridian is in the top ten of books ever written, IMO. \n\nUnfortunately, his recent book, The Passenger, was medicore. The chapters in italics with the Thalidomide Kid are unnecessary and feel like Stephen King on a bad day. Skippable. I wish that book had been better. It was close to fitting into the ranks of his best books, but it's not good enough to reread - except for randomly-chosen excerpts where he conjures apocalyptic observations and shows you what you can do with the english language.",

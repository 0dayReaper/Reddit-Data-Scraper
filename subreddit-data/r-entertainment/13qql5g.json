He found that the rapper, who died at 25, had barely anything to show for his chart-topping career. No mutual funds. No IRA. No real estate. Tupac didn\u2019t even own his Woodland Hills, Calif., home. There was only a five-figure life insurance policy (the beneficiary was his half sister, Sekyiwa), two cars, and a single checking account that contained less than $105,000. Court fees and taxes would consume that quickly. The situation was so bad that when a young woman named Jacquelyn McNealey, paralyzed by a stray bullet during a Tupac concert in Arkansas, sued Tupac and asked for $16.6 million in damages, no one showed up in court to defend the estate.",

My business partner spend a year living in my spare room and doing more heroin before I understood there was no saving anything and left NYC.\n\nMy spending wasn't too bad.

I also spent a lot of time in /r/RandomActsofChristmas and /r/RandomActsofPizza (not sure they still even exist) buying a lot of shit for people. A lot of kids got bikes that year!

These rappers hang out in the same clubs and circles as big time drug dealers, so he probably had the necessary connections to move drugs and when the rap money started drying up he needed to look for other sources of income",

I mean there\u2019s a pattern of artist who don\u2019t come from money, so once they make it, there\u2019s a huge temptation to cut ties with the world that made you who you are to get to that point\u2026and there\u2019s also a pattern with these artists who come from nothing and can\u2019t not help their family and friends. I feel like this could have just seemed like a win/win all around for him as far as reputation and altruism go, especially if it\u2019s a business he knows and understands. 500 grams of cocaine sounds like a lot but it was intent to distribute which means he\u2019s probably not making as much as the people he\u2019s giving it to to sell. If you read the article you\u2019ll see even the judge felt bad about prosecuting him but couldn\u2019t ignore the crime cause of how serious it is for one person but I really don\u2019t think this was a reckless greed thing. I think he was giving it out to help his friends make money, someone got caught and snitched. Damn shame hope he keeps his head up",

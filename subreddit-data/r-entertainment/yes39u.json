Only clothing company to admit they don't deny the holocaust.\n\nEdit: LMAO I'm already getting some anti-Semitic remarks from people about a jacket company. *jesus* guys. The irony is not lost. in case anyone cares this is from a Nathan Fan You segemnt about how he found out a jacket company him &amp; his father supported (tyga(?)) had a founder who denied the holocaust. As a Jew this made him say \"whoops\". So he took control.\n\nTurning it into a 'bit' about how you never really know who you're supporting with things like this. He set out to make a great, high-end sportswear jacket. One his dad would love. The joke being that its the \"only\" jacket company to openly admit the holocaust actually happened. He then turned that into a way to actual promote awarness. Because some people really are so vile /or stupid to believe **the holocaust** is made up.\n\nHope that sheds some light on it\n\nEdit2: u/bozwald also shared:\n\n&gt;summit ice will also do straight up trade ins of the holocaust denying company jackets for their own with no charge or questions asked. (I think maybe only in person though, I don\u2019t see it on the site anymore)",

A Jewish man was accused and convicted of murdering a 13 year old factory worker, Mary Phagan, where he was VP in Atlanta, GA.\n\nEvidence came out that it actually may have been the night watchman and Frank &amp; his wife fought to overturn his death sentence. They were successful in  getting the governor to commute it to life imprisonment instead.  \n\nWell, the white men in town did not like that Frank would no longer be killed and they broke into his jail cell, drug him out to Marietta, GA and lynched him. It made many Jews in the South move up North and the Anti-Defamation League was born out of the Antisemitism.",

There is definitely a jewish community in Dallas, but I dunno much about the scene out there.\n\nIn answer: a good explantation of jew-hatred is literally over 2000 years of history covering a ton of different places, but the long story short is people are just ignorant and racist. Jews are an [ethnoreligious group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnoreligious_group) from southwest asia, the jewish homeland was repeatedly colonized, and eventually jews were dispersed and made perpetual minorities\u2026 and people tend to mistreat minorities. The back to back rise of Christianity &amp; Islam as proselytizing \u201cworld religions\u201d which built empires spanning pretty much everywhere jews lived (and built off a lot of appropriated jewish ritual/tradition) made things even more complicated basically right from the start.\n\nIt\u2019s a multi-faceted subject (there\u2019s a lot of religious/cultural/economic elements you can dig into) but I think that\u2019s the setup the rest of it was built on.",

So it wasn't the CIA per se, but CIA connected people helped establish Disney's extremely advantageous real estate/tax situation in Florida. \n\nNo idea where he got the part about Bambi, though. Kind of a tenuous link to build a whole conspiracy out of, but I guess that's the nature of conspiracy theories!",

And the CIA isn't alone. Pretty much every defense/intelligence agency in the US has people doing the same thing.\n\nThe most recent example I can think of is with the movie \"Zero Dark Thirty\" which presented the CIA in a positive light and misrepresented the reality of their use of torture in the war on terror (basically showing it as effective when it was not). The screenwriter was chummy with CIA reps and changed parts of the script at their request.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/cia-helped-produce-zero-dark-thirty\n\nThe stuff with the arts that I'm aware of happened in the 40's-70's but was more insidious imo as it was kept secret for a long time. Most notably, the Paris Review (and a number of other mags) were eventually exposed as being run by the CIA. There's a lot of well-known artists and writers with proven ties to the agency too: James Baldwin, Ernest Hemmingway, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/pgp53z/how-the-cia-infiltrated-the-worlds-literature\n\nThere are other book out there, but here are a couple. (Can't remember if these are the ones I read or if it were others.)\n\nThe CIA in Hollywood by Tricia Jenkins\n\nThe Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters by Saunders",

The double take Mike Myers made when Kanye said \"George Bush doesn't care about black people\" is price less. Then cutting to Chris Tucker with this uncomfortable stare was a master piece. Him completely ruining Taylor Swift's moment was insane but still had humor in it. There's nothing funny about being anti-semetic. And what's worst is he clearly knows there's a difference between 1 guy who happens to be Jewish that fucked him over, verse all Jewish people, but he doesn't care. He just wants to speak KKKlandice Owens bigoted talking points and unironically shout hotep bullshit. I'm glad he actually facing consequences by losing major money. I know I can't support him anymore.",

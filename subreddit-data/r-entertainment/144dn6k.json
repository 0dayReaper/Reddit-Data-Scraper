The pipeline has lost a few of the craziest but others have gained stronger footing, the conspiracy stuff isn't as strong as the pseudo intellectual debate bros like Shapiro, Crowder and Peterson. But it's all connected in the pipeline. \n\nTucker and Fox probably parted for lawsuit reasons, but now they are trying to increase the efficiency of the pipeline. Tucker will still be driving traffic to media outlets like Fox. \n\nThey use internet talking heads as scouts for content farming like buzzfeed does. Just have a group of people talk and talk all day long throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. Mainstream outlets will take what sticks and try to make it a firm narrative. It's worked fabulously with things like critical race theory, drag shows and transphobia.

My favorite excerpt:\n\n&gt; She is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders, and nubile breasts. And she is devastatingly beautiful for a girl with a tail. In human age she would be 18. Her name is NEYTIRI(nay-Tee-ree).\n\nEdit: a bunch of people emailed me overnight claiming it\u2019s from a fanfic. I wish too, people. I checked this against multiple versions of the screenplay that is still online. Here is the script [on StudioBinder](https://app.studiobinder.com/company/580e85847e7982164664e844/collab/6204f7851915501c4891869f/projects/6204f613c9c0b49393f5a14d/document/6204f61fc9c0b49393f5a1c3?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=sb-app-link&amp;utm_campaign=script&amp;utm_content=full-script-pdf-download&amp;utm_term=avatar-script-teardown&amp;filter=%257B%2522l%2522%253A%25226204f62c17574b303b0e5db6%2522%257D), here on [IMSDB](https://imsdb.com/scripts/Avatar.html), here on [8Flix](https://8flix.com/assets/screenplays/a/tt0499549/Avatar-2009-screenplay-by-James-Cameron.pdf), and here on [ScriptSlug](https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/scripts/avatar-2009.pdf). That stupid scene is consistently on page 35 of the pdf versions where Neytiri is introduced. I saw the link to the fanfic since a bunch of people emailed it to me overnight, but I think that fanfic probably plagiarized the screenplay; I\u2019m not seeing some other version of the screenplay anywhere.",

But the most amazing thing about the movie is that it is the highest grossing movie ever, has been out for 13 years and has its own section in a Disney theme park yet\u2026 it has left absolutely no impact on popular culture. Nobody knows the names of any of the characters, beyond the two main characters possibly. It was a visually stunning movie. That\u2019s about it.",

            "comment": "I honestly love JC's films I really do but man is he a pretentious fucking douchebag of a director. His film is 13 years old. I can't even remember the plot let alone the names of the characters. He expects this film to have the same level of hype as a Marvel film but the MCU and films like it are kept in the spotlight ALL THE TIME. Disney makes sure to keep up interest by having a healthy supply of Marvel and SW to ram down your throat every single month with shows, movies, action figures, etc. \n\n\nAvatar was super big in 2009 and then dropped off the face of the earth. We haven't had ANYTHING release for it except a themed area of Disneyland with one ride that took over A Bug's Life. Other than that Avatar has been dead with James Cameron swearing that new films are coming but he had been swearing that for years and years until FINALLY now one releases. But even the marketing for the sequel has been a single trailer at the theaters that barely explain the plot and also give us zero recap. \n\n\n\n\nWe aren't trolls we are simply stating the fact that we really can't remember much of the original Avatar and JC's extremely fragile ego can't handle that someone DARE question his unwavering genius. Again I love his films. I don't think there is a JC film I dislike. I own all of them (The Abyss being my favorite) and I think it he one of the most talented directors of our generation but the man needs to let go of his ego big time.",

Okay. I might see it.\" and \"who gives a shit?\"",

I recently watched a documentary on Aliens and he pissed off the entire production crew so much that they all walked off the job and Cameron\u2019s wife had to talk them back into staying because James was to arrogant to admit that he was being too hard on them. I don\u2019t think any of the actors aside from Paxton &amp; Weaver had anything good to say about him.\n\nThat said, I agree with you - he has done some amazing films.",

And hey, I get it; his films have been wildly successful and his last two films were the highest grossing films after release.\n\nBut that ego has made him defensive about his work. Like I recall really wanting to enjoy Terminator Dark Fate and being disappointed like most fans were. And it\u2019s easy to blame the director. But he was the producer and writer AND after reading about the issues in the editing room, it gave the sense that he was the proxy director: he\u2019d be at creative liberty to do the film the way he wants and it\u2019d be someone else\u2019s name at the directors chair. Anytime there\u2019s that sort of dysfunction in the creative process, the end result is screwed regardless.\n\nSo yeah, I definitely think his ego has made him hyper-defensive about his filmography and I can imagine how upset he\u2019d be if this film didn\u2019t become the new highest grossing film.\n\nKinda like when Avengers Endgame came out and took the spot so what did he do? Rerelease avatar AGAIN. \n\nI applaud and appreciate directors that take chances and aren\u2019t fearless- it\u2019s awesome to see Spielberg and Fincher still at the craft and taking chances. Cameron, not so much. I\u2019ll give it a watch just because I saw the first but if it doesn\u2019t do well, I hope his ego can take that blame since there\u2019s no proxy director this time.",

            "comment": "I actually just wrote a huge paper on this. Cameron faced numerous charges of plagiarism with Avatar, some legit, others not so much. This movie was a Mashup of other significantly better films with pretty cgi paint and the brand new motion capture technology. Ebert gave 2 thumbs up saying Avatar would create a cult, but it was largely forgotten.  Fact is, we don't remember the characters, we aren't trolls, we are legitimate movie goers, and the characters were boring, cookie cutter characters. The storyline follows the white male savior complex where the white man goes and falls in love with the savages and their culture, so he must then save the savages with the power of his whiteness. And the story also mocks both your intelligence as a movie goer and attempts to ignore legitimate history. When the evil white men are preparing to attack the Navi, Jake goes to pray to the big tree, and in the final battle the planet comes to save the Navi. (Major oversimplification but still) What is the message here? That had the Natives prayed to the Great Spirit the earth would have saved them from the invading white man? Would it have saved them from smallpox? Would it have stopped the Americans from reneging on treaty after treaty so they wouldn't be sequestered to reservation slums? In Dances With Wolves (Kevin Conroys best film and the film Cameron most STOLE FROM) Conroy informs you on the travesty that happened to the Lakota at the end of the film. He doesn't sugar coat the abuse we put them through. So if Cameron is saying he's mad we don't remember his characters it's all on him.  \n\nTLDR: He made a plagarized shit film with nice coats of paint and shiny new tech, called it his own, while spitting on your, the consumer's, intelligence and native history. So no wonder we don't remember his shit.",

He's popular with the younger demographic but everyone outside it isn't as impressed and the ones that are in that his demographic audience are starting to outgrow him after 13 years. That being said, I seen a Tom Greene episode last year and it was the stupidest pile of garbage I've ever seen but I absolutely loved it when I was much younger.",

Honestly he should've made a shit-ton off that movie and instead got fucked over.  He invested SOO much time into it too.\n\nThe lack of transparity streaming services have with the people who create content for them is ridiculous.  How a movie streamed that many times and was that popular, made so little money for the people who created it?  Insane.",

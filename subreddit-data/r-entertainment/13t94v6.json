I find I like the quality of the acting, directing and other aspects, but when the characters all appear to me to be just a bunch of assholes or nobodies I can't see myself even wanting to get to know then I lose interest pretty fast.\n\nThat doesn't mean that I want them to be goody-twoshoes types, far from it.  The best characters are those that you know are bad guys and gals, but you find yourself engaging with on other levels.  It's not easy to write, and it's a bit too easy to simply create a bunch of dark characters and call it \"depth of character\" (words fail me, but I think you get it).  \n\nThe gold standard for good character development was, of course, Breaking Bad.  That was pure genius in fact in that regard.  We somehow managed to fall in love with a weedy, annoying little tweeker and his deeply flawed mentor.",

I watched through the honeypot episode and then just... found something else to watch instead. It was funny the first episode, sorta funny the second episode... and then just got boring and formulaic really, really fast while trying to shoehorn in the whole family vs the job sideplot. And as far as the missions every episode, everything is way way way out there. Like they went straight to the absurdity of the later Fast and the Furious movies without any kind of build up after the first episode. \n\nIt's just such an underwhelming show, especially with the potential it could have had.",

I compare this sheathing to the rubber covers on electrical wires, and when the sheathing is degraded, short circuits occur throughout your body, sometimes including your eyes. (Optic neuritis) This is just a simple way to explain the disease to those who are not familiar. \n\nMS is likely many, many similar diseases lumped together and diagnosed under the same umbrella. I wonder if your illness has similar treatments?  Do you respond well to steroids for example?",

Ironically, I worked in healthcare for 2 decades until I, myself, became the patient. \n\nAnd steroids don't do anything to improve my eyes, it's been tried and tested several times. I used to get put on them for my COPD before I went blind and I tried to tell the docs that I get the worse side effects such as extreme insomnia and joint and muscle fuckery, crippling headaches and so on. But noooo they didn't wanna listen to me so I wound up in a meatwagon on the way to the hospital two months ago, embarrassed as hell because I fell out in public. I was diagnosed with steroidal fatigue syndrome, they'd tanked my joints and muscles and had jacked my BP and caused a cardiac dysrhythmia. I was told to immediately discontinue any and all steroids.\n\nSo I got to call the rheumatologist with a big old \"I told you so\" and now they're actually listening to me in regards to meds... sometimes. I had to fight for a low dose of tramadol for the light induced headaches with 15 different doctors. The ophneurologist finally wrote me a damn script. For 5 a week lol. They want to put me on methotrexate or azathioprine to tank my immune system (to slow the rate of blindness, nothing will regrow my retinas) and I've told them that's a bad idea because of my COPD and my tendency to catch all respiratory viruses, but they keep insisting. I stopped fretting over it though, because medicaid will never cover an off-label use of such expensive meds in a million years.\n\nUgh, sorry for the rant. I'm so tired of being their guinea pig.",

If no scars show up, you cannot get an MS diagnosis. \n\nExcept that you can.. and I eventually did..  I was tested for literally everything else. Lupus, cat scratch fever, Parkinson\u2019s, Lime disease, a bunch of obscure neuro diseases etc etc. all negative. Eventually I was given the MS diagnosis and lumped in with all the other people who are given a diagnosis for MS because all else has been ruled out.  The lengthy time periods between relapses made this harder as it\u2019s difficult to diagnose a patient with no symptoms. So yeah, 10 years. \n\nSome never get a diagnosis Which is why I\u2019m often dubious when a diagnosis is given in days to some.\n\nOff topic, but I\u2019m one of the few humans who have received a lime disease vaccine. It was discontinued in 2002 I believe.  (a new one is coming out soon). I had to insist on being tested for lime disease as the doctors insisted I couldn\u2019t possibly have it living in Indiana (!?). When I finally got tested for it I insisted on getting the vaccine and months later the vaccine was discontinued.",

It\u2019s full of unrealistic scenarios with unrealistic action and funny dialogue. Pretty much sums up everything I grew up on, but it\u2019s still fun and entertaining. \n\nGo watch any old school Arnie movie, the Lethal Weapons, Beverly Hills Cops, etc and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Simply pure entertainment at its peak.",

No, I will not participate.\u201d\n\n&gt;\"It's because of the history that I have with them. And my mother didn't raise a hypocrite. You can call me a lot of things, but not that.\"\n\nFor context, Fraser accused Philip Berk, a former president and member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (org behind the Golden Globes) of sexual assualt in 2018. The investigation found that Berk did it, but remained in the organization and they said his actions were intended as a joke. Fraser was never given an actual apology.",

God I adore that movie. It starts out so campy but by the end your rooting the fuck out of him.\n\nI really wanted him to be Tom Hanks 2.0\n\nI grew up on Hanks as a kid, from Splash, Turner and Hooch, hell even Bachelor Party, Joe vs Volcano, etc. \n\nFraser I thought would follow that same route and become synonymous as Hank is, in my eyes he is, wish he got more roles, happy he\u2019s getting a second chance to get some great acting, he deserves it",

The assault allegation, his subsequent divorce, and the death of his mother launched Fraser into a depression that, combined with his health issues, led to a pause in his career.[48][58] Several publications and social media users interpreted that Fraser was \"blacklisted\" from Hollywood because of his allegation against Berk.[59] However, Fraser said he would not use the term and was doubtful that the decline in his career had anything to do with the incident. In his 2019 appearance on the radio show Sway in the Morning, Fraser said \"I don't think the HFPA really wield that much power. This was not an executive, this was a former president of that organization which is essentially journalists.\"",

Fraser was never given an actual apology.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n&gt; \"Although it was concluded that Mr. Berk inappropriately touched Mr. Fraser, the evidence supports that it was intended to be taken as a joke and not as a sexual advance.\"\n\nThat is fucking ridiculous. Who cares how it was intended? What matters is how it was interpreted by Mr. Fraser. You can't just say \"It was a prank, bro!\"\n\nBerk needs to admit wrongdoing and sincerely apologize, and until he does, this will not be over.",

            "comment": "Brendan Fraser and Keanu Reeves should do a movie similar to \"My Dinner with Andre\" but with them just being them at dinner. It would probably just be the most wholesome thing ever made.  \n\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add that the last 20 minutes of the movie should basically be Keanu killing a bunch of people in the restaurant because somehow the entire thing was a set up while Brendan would end up in the basement in the gun fire or something and finds some Egyptian hieroglyph and then I don't know, something happens. Maybe Carrie-Anne Moss and Rachel Weisz show up and take there drunk asses home.",

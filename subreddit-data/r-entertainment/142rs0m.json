Sundance was practically packed with them in the 90s and early 2000s, leading to many of this sub's favorite directors having careers today. \n\nThe difference here is that some younger filmmakers are asking to sprint before they've learned how to walk. What this article leaves out is that Wolfhard was asking for millions of dollars to make a movie, without ever having made so much as a professional short. He also asked for the money before they had a package, with a self-written screenplay that was by many accounts in need of deeper development.\n\nSo it's less about his age and more about his inexperience behind the camera. For comparison, Kane Parsons is making his first feature at 17 at a slightly higher budget, but he managed to secure the funding alongside his producers because he had already been making professional-looking projects.",

I don\u2019t think age defines filmmaking in any way. I think everyone has stories to tell, and if you have the chance to do it, then do it.\u201d",

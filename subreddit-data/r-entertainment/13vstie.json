A wave of dismissals (the first of many) came not long after the arrival of executive producer Carlton Cuse, an industry veteran who had worked on mainstream \u201990s dramas like The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. and Nash Bridges. When *Lost* cocreator Damon Lindelof was starting out as a TV writer, one of his first jobs was on the staff of Nash Bridges. *Lost* was an enormous undertaking and Lindelof was overwhelmed by his vast new responsibilities, so he asked his former boss Cuse to work on the ABC program with him. Given that *Lost* was at the forefront of pop culture, Cuse and Lindelof were among the most well-known showrunners in American television for quite some time\u2014avuncular, funny figureheads, fanning the flames of conjecture about certain mysteries, teasing upcoming developments, and, at times, attempting to defuse anger or confusion regarding some of the drama\u2019s twists and turns. There was drama behind the scenes too, and it was also dark and complicated.\n\nBased on conversations with more than a dozen people who worked on *Lost* in various capacities, it\u2019s clear that the landmark series played right into Hollywood\u2019s most long-standing patterns, in which auteurs wield enormous power with very little oversight. Later, you will hear from Lindelof and Cuse at length regarding the allegations and issues their former colleagues raised with me. I talked to people across all six seasons, half of whom were people of color and more than half of whom were women. Every person I spoke with is justifiably proud of the work they did on the drama, but by all accounts, they worked very hard on a job that could be quite grueling. And scarring.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted to do was write some really cool episodes of a cool show. That was an impossibility on that staff,\u201d said Monica Owusu-Breen, who worked on *Lost*\u2019s third season. \u201cThere was no way to navigate that situation. Part of it was they really didn\u2019t like their characters of color. When you have to go home and cry for an hour before you can see your kids because you have to excise all the stress you\u2019ve been holding in, you\u2019re not going to write anything good after that.\u201d\n\n***Read more from the new book Burn It Down' here:*** [https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/05/lost-tv-show-culture](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/05/lost-tv-show-culture)",

Even if you were white person who just is decent and wants to work organically, this sounds like HELL, but as a woman or a POC? Turns my stomach. Like literally the part about the producer being so angry at the black actor who played Mr.Eko that he wanted write his death as a horric lynching actually made my stomach hurt.",

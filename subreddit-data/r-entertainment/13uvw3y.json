Fortunately, he got sober just in time, and while I can't say I ever expected him to end up a married daddy of 5, I'm just glad he's still with us and much happier.",

Most of the musicians he's had in the band over the years were brought on board later on; the only one with him from the beginning was Chris Vrenna, and they had a major falling-out in the mid-to-late '90s. (Not sure if they're speaking again or not; I hope they are, because especially as you get older, you enjoy talking with people who remember \"back in the day\" when you were all young and foolish.)  I don't really want to call the others \"hired hands\" *per se*, but NIN has always been *his* baby, end of argument, so I'm a bit surprised that Atticus is an official member now.  Seeing how well they work together, though, I'm thinking it's a good thing.",

A shell of silence, in the underground they plunge, On the cusp of chaos, their war cry, \"Cowabunga\".\n\nIn the city's belly, a mutation taking hold, Tales of yesteryear, through the sewers, they've been told. Four shadows standing, against the forces that blunder, A battle cry rising, breaking silence, it's \"Cowabunga\".\n\n(Chorus) Cowabunga, where the fallen shadows run, Into the face of the unknown, under a hidden sun. Cowabunga, where warriors are sprung, Four hearts unbroken, speaking in tongues.\n\n(Verse 2) In the murky water, where the rats are kings, A quartet of turtles, to their purpose they cling. In the face of danger, there's no room to be younger, Riding the wave of destiny, they shout, \"Cowabunga\".\n\nSplintered tales spun in the moonlight's glow, In the city's underbelly, where the urban rivers flow. From the shadows they emerge, their mantra never hungers, A call to arms, a call to life, it's \"Cowabunga\".\n\n(Chorus) Cowabunga, where the night meets the day, Where the brave tread fearlessly, in the heart of the fray. Cowabunga, these words they've sung, Tales of four brothers, their legacy has just begun.\n\n(Bridge) In a world split by shadows, where the unseen lie, They rise from the depths, beneath the city's sky. Against the storm, they are the thunder, In the heart of chaos, their echo, \"Cowabunga\".\n\n(Chorus) Cowabunga, in the labyrinth we trust, Underneath the starless sky, against the world unjust. Cowabunga, their saga, from their lungs, Resounds through time, the song unsung.\n\n(Outro) In the heart of the city, where the unseen are kings, Four brothers stand tall, against the storm, it brings. Their call to the night, their war cry, it lingers, In the face of despair, they cry, \"Cowabunga\".",

Trent may have been a spectator to some of the nastiness, but I don't recall ever hearing any really bad stories about Trent even then, and my friends and I were *pretty damn hardcore* in terms of knowing stuff.  I strongly suspect Manson made up at least 90% of his stories; he likes wallowing in the muck, and it's even better if he can drag someone else who's not such a low-life down with him.  FWIW, \n\nTL;DR: Don't take Manson's word for anything; while Trent did some stupid shit back in the day, he was never an active instigator of anything awful, so I'm pretty sure you can listen to him with a clear conscience.",

I guess I shouldn't be surprised that he and Johnny Depp are such good friends (he's actually Lily-Rose Depp's godfather, God help us); both of their career highlights were 15-20 years ago, and they're mostly coasting on their reputations as both \"bad boys\" and artists. \n\nDepp's always been the more talented of the two, and it's been sad to see his artistic and personal decline over the years.  He's a *damn* good actor, but unfortunately all the drinking and drugging over the years is catching up to him, to the point where I strongly suspect he has significant brain damage, esp. from having been a massive boozehound for 30+ years.  If he were to sober up and stay clean, that might help, but it's possible the damage is permanent, which is terribly sad, since he was *so* good in the past.  Even if he can't get back to his acting heights, though, I wish he'd clean up for his kids' sake; I'm sure they'd like to have him around for as long as possible. \n\n(Yes, some other actors have cleaned up and apparently still have most of their brain cells--I'm thinking of RDJ and Colin Farrell in particular here--but they were both considerably younger; Farrell was just hitting 30, and RDJ not much older, and they were both inspired by their loved ones to stay on the wagon.  Depp is turning 60 on June 9th, so he's had nearly another 30 years to do himself damage. Again, I *hate* seeing people do this to themselves, but what can you do?)",

I'm just glad he's still alive, creative, and seemingly content in his personal life, although I *never* expected him to end up the father of five kids.

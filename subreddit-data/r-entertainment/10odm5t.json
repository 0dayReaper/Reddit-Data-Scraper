I first saw him in Xena many years ago and he was always popping up in stuff but nothing ever quite seemed to take off for him. Even his role as Bones in Star Trek was less than it could have been because they seemed to reduce his role to give greater focus to Uhura",

But back in 2012 you could make those and have them do okay in the box office because you had dvd/blue Ray sales to make your money back. But streaming has killed that second revenue source. So movies are either small budget so they can do okay and still make money (most horror movies now). Or they are big tentpole productions over 100m in budget hoping to grab blockbuster ticket sales.\n\nYou really can't do Dredd cheaply, but the last one didn't do well enough to justify a big budget sequel. It sucks.",

Urban, Olyphant, Rockwell, Pearce etc I've enjoyed watching them evolve and stay relevant. Even Brad Pitt still has that side to him in certain roles.. I was really excited to see what Heath could do as he grew, especially the leap he took after Dark Knight, he would've had his pick of scripts as an actor/director.",

The series are very hit or miss and they're producing films that would've been better as series (Multiverse of madness should've been Wandavision S2) and series that would've worked better as films (Obi Wan, most of the plot happened in the last two episodes, would've made an ok film). There is definitely something wrong with Disney's pipeline that they are producing so many duds let down by structure and writing. \n\nAt least every now and then they get it right, Mandalorian and Andor have been good, and worth some of the failures",

The amount of people complaining about certain characters surviving season 3 after all that build-up was huge.\n\nIt's a decent show with some great actors in it and a few very outlandish set pieces each season (driving a boat into a whale for example) but from reading half the comments in this thread you would think it was the single best thing to ever grace television screens.",

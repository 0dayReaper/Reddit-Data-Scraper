The franchise as a whole has poisoned its reputation by churning out visually identical movies and shows that consistently have zero stakes or consequences to be invested in. Why waste my time even on the good entries?",

This one went big, real big.  The first one was actually a rather small story.  The heart of it was about Miles' relationships (primarily father and uncle, then mentor and love interest).  \n\nThis one had similar heart to the story, but it was Gwen's story.  It just got less focus as the main story line was much bigger and had larger action sequences.\n\nI mean... none of that is bad.  It's just that it felt a little light on it compared to how well the first one wove it in, but the set up for the next one looks like it could be loaded for more of it.\n\nI don't have anything actually negative to say about these movies.",

They want that investment paid off. Not to endlessly be strung along. People don't have time for it. The truly proven methods are serialized with full conclusions (star wars first 2 trilogies, lotr, even the hobbit, Harry Potter, recent planet of the Apes, the matrix, avatar is being made this way) and loosely connected mostly stand alone entries (crown jewel is Bond which is why it's the longest running film franchise ever i think, mission impossible, Indiana Jones to an extent, slashers, Terminator, predator, Rocky kinda fits both, Rambo).

Hell, it is hard to even define a movie as they have been and continue to change in theory, consumption, and practice. Just look at Japan to understand. The highest grossing film there is based on a manga/comic and the film is a sequel to a television season and now the film has been subsequently followed up by another season of television. Don\u2019t even get me started on the 18 One Piece movies. Their whole industry is run like a comic industry and it makes plenty of money too.\n\nEven from the very beginning in the US, plenty of films need outside understanding to appreciate a film. The Universal Monsters met Abbot &amp; Costello. This is just an evolution of that. The MCU is at 32 films. Saying damn near everyone is jumping ship is silly when every single recent film (not affected by the pandemic) has turned a profit, even the maligned Ant-Man 3.",

Animation and anime in particular has always run very differently from most other film based media. Even so, though examples you gave are all linear and under the same title, they aren't jumping back and forth between multiple sub franchises on a month to month basis. \n\nBut yes, films are quite pointedly an all-in venture. They carry a heavy price tag (blockbusters especially but almost everything under the film umbrella is very expensive to produce), they take months and years of the creators lives to finish and that's straight through, and very rarely do creatives or actors want to be attached to the same thing for more than 10 years. There's so many factors that make films a very \"right here\" right now deal with any particular set of people. Mcu, a multipronged, neverending story, that now also is shying away from recasts, and every project has the price tag of a major blockbuster, is built to fall. They caught fire and rode the wave, but it's not sustainable and it's showing. \n\nShows give more leeway but are also finite. The only thing that's actually a 1 :1 comparison to comics are soap operas, which are categorically known to be trash just by the nature of their storytelling. Comics themselves always collapsed under their own weight and always become difficult for people to get into because of juggling so many titles. People just aren't trying to do with with movies, not enough that you can turn multiple franchises into something like that. \n\nYou either have a hard continuity story you want to tell and bang it out over serialized entries, preferably before your actors age out or don't want to do it anymore. With something like marvel and dc that's built for reinvention, you just get to do that multiple times but telling different stories with different iterations.  Or you have a much longer standing franchise that's more loosely connected per entry and naturally rotates out cast and tones as times change. That way each entry itself is taken as it's own thing and even if there's a bad one the next isn't as bogged down by it because it could be completely different or just a different story in general. \n\nThings are changing and there's always developments but it always ends up being a variation those two structures. Even the plan for Matt Reeves Batman so far takes the best of both worlds but is wrapping it in a nice condensed package (movie-show-movie-show-movie, done). It's not 5 shows all unrelated but not unrelated with 6 films that all have nothing to do with each other but may down the line, and if you're not interested in one and skip it but then it becomes important down the line. You just increasingly start to check out as it seems that you have to watch a bunch of random bullshit that you may not even like for some small connective piece that will make sense later. Once people start skipping stuff it becomes more likely that they stop caring about the rest. Watching movies or shows shouldn't be work and these projects can't afford them to be work.",

Their whole industry is run like a comic industry and it makes plenty of money too.\n\nWhile One Piece has run forever (far longer than the creator originally intended) it's important to note that there's a fundamental difference in the way Japanese manga (and we can take by extension media based on it) operates. Namely that manga is creator driven while US comics are corporate driven.\n\nNo matter how long they run, manga *do* end. Contrast that with American comics, which have continually published stories with the same heroes for 80 years in a never ending line. Passing the same characters along from creator to creator.\n\nManga have been outselling US comics for a while. While there are multiple factors as to why, I feel pretty confident that a big part of it is that people like stories that actually have a beginning, middle and an end. Not a forever ongoing constantly changing stream of creators that can feel like a slough.",

It still has Spider-Man and it still goes into the \u201cmultiverse\u201d\u2014but it looks and sounds and feels so fresh.\n\nI can\u2019t say the same for like, the recent Ant Man movie or Shang Chi that my friend said: \u201cis different\u201d.

Not in the 'movie critic trying to put out a quotable  blurb about a superhero movie with wooden at best acting', but in as literal a sense as possible. \n\nI've seen probably over half of the MCU/non-MCU Marvel movies, and haven't seen the movie that preceded this one, but it was the most enjoyable superhero movie I've ever seen.",

Every Marvel phase had some, Incredible Hulk, Thor 2, Ant Man 2, Captain Marvel. Now it's stuff like Eternals or Ant Man 3. This increase in public taste is also a **cause** of superhero fatigue, because every poorly received superhero movie erodes the public's confidence in the genre.

If movies within a genre keep trying new and interesting things and doing them well, I\u2019m all for it.  \n\nI\u2019m not tired of all superhero movies. I\u2019m tired of superhero movies that follow the same basic template over and over while adding nothing new.",

See where ur coming from.\n\nIsn't there only so much room to change before it stops making sense to think of it as a super hero movie? Is James Bond a superhero franchise?\n\nIf they take away the costumes, the big villain trying to take over the city, the supernatural powers, the themes about duty and being true to yourself, comments about police and military that are right on the tip of your tongue when thinking about superheros, once you get rid of all those template constraints, what are we doing at that point?\n\nI gotta say, I'm tired with most iterations of a guy in a costume with magic powers. That is a pretty narrow band of all possible stories, and it seems like 90+% of possible super hero stories have to fall in that band.",

You could make a great western, or a terrible western, but the genre was saturated and played out.  Sure, there will be the occasional western even today, and mostly it'll be good, but the genre is played out.   Superhero movies are feeling like westerns.  The fact that MCU quality has tanked is a contributing factor, but at heart, the general public tire of narrow genres over time.  There'll always be a niche market though, especially in the age of streaming, where you don't need to play to the general public any more.",

Instant fame and celebrity.  The story needs conflict thats actually challenging for a superhero, which almost always means some unrealistically powerful villain.  \n\n\nBecause the power needs to be tied to the conflict to justify its presence, the conflict is always about the hero's power overcoming the force of the antagonists.    \n\n\nThe stakes need to be high to explain why this person that can shoot flames out of her fingers isn't doing the tonight show circuit.  Because the stakes are high and the abilities are powerful - its always a life/death (or imprisonment / 'fighting off) struggle.  \n\n\nAnd because they're almost always franchises, you know in almost every film how that struggle is going to end.    \n\n\nYou can find ways to freshen up the framework and there's still films that manage to find a fresh take for sure.  But there's definitely some limits on the type of story you can tell, and that's why so many blend together for me.",

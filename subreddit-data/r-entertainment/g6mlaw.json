Props to MacFarlane.\n\nWhile Oprah may be considered to be a national treasure by many,  Phil and Oz have proven they can NOT be considered impartial health advocates during this epidemic.   \n\nThey are at best, paid for NON expert pundits,  and at worst, furthering the misinformation that WILL cost lives and resources .\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nEdit  this is relevant \n\nJohn Oliver \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dRFbwjwQ4VE",

Most doctors are good people because it would be very hard to justify our lifestyle if the only motivator was money. Which brings me to the point that being a cardiac surgeon is NOT a million dollar a year job usually. \n\nBasically...he sold his soul for money and fame. Plain and simple. Some doctors do this with less camera and makeup and those are the same people that wrote bogus hydroxychloroquine prescriptions, sell Botox and do vasectomies on billboards, and write bogus MM prescriptions. \n\nThough not even close to a majority of doctors they do exist and when they are on Oprah it\u2019s way more obvious.",

Don\u2019t know a whole lot about that and who\u2019s to say she made those choices anyway (not defending her, just don\u2019t know enough about it either way).\n\nAside from that, a lot of people have been coming forward with stories about how she\u2019s super mean outside of the show. So now she\u2019s being called out for being a hypocrite who doesn\u2019t practice what she preaches.  \n\nAlso, she apparently described being on lockdown to being in prison. People are just sick of celebrities complaining about being stuck in their mansions. My take is that with this quarantine, people are being attracted to any story not related to Coronavirus so Ellen is getting more negative attention than usual.",

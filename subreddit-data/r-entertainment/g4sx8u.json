He will literally say whatever he thinks people want to hear, and say it in a palatable but intelligent way as to seem trustworthy and scientifically informed.  However, Americans have to start thinking for themselves.  Does the government really, really have to tell you not to go to a Steely Dan concert or a WWE match when there is a pandemic?  Really?  Should the government be telling adults to wash their hands?  The point is, we shouldn\u2019t be so ignorant and infantile as to depend on the government and tv personalities for basic common sense.  We should have enough sense of self to think for ourselves in at least VERY basic survival.",

The younger generation who is vehemently against \u201cpay to play\u201d should seriously question anyone who came from these universities.

That university system is nothing but wealthy snakes acting like they\u2019re better than everyone else. The truth is they\u2019re terrible.

In the United States, this generally arose because many in 18th-century medical professions trained in Scotland, which used the M.D. degree nomenclature. In England, however, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery was used and eventually in the 19th century became the standard in Scotland too. Thus, in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other countries, the M.D. is a research doctorate, higher doctorate, honorary doctorate or applied clinical degree restricted to those who already hold a professional degree in medicine; in those countries, the equivalent professional to the North American and some others use of M.D. is still typically titled Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine\n\nBesides, he presents himself as a psychologist, so his PhD in clinical psychology is definitely relevant, even if he's not legally allowed to practice medicine. I could not care less about Dr Phil, but the idea that only licensed physicians should call themselves doctors, an academic title, is silly.",

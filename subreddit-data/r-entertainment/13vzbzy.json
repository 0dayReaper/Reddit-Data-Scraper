She will be allowed to speak to her family via video calls.\n\nCompare that to how the average criminal is treated in the USA.",

Sure, she didn\u2019t go out and physically assault people, but her actions had very real consequences to people\u2019s health all the same. Her actions, IMO are worse than a lot of \u201cviolent\u201d crimes because of the scope of what she did. She effected MANY people. If we\u2019re not sending people to prison for interfering with people\u2019s medical care, then we probably shouldn\u2019t bother sending anyone. \n\nNot sure, just give her a little community service because she isn\u2019t \u201cviolent.\u201d",

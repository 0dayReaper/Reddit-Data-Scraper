            "comment": "**The Incident** \n\n&gt; Speer has now told the UK\u2019s Daily Mail that **Disney terminated his contract after he was seen naked in his trailer by a female runner who had knocked on his door and then opened it without waiting. Speer told the newspaper he hid himself behind the wardrobe and thought no more about it** until, six days later, **he was told there had been a couple of complaints \u2013 referring to this incident and another, when he\u2019d walked naked past his open trailer door.**\n\n&gt; Speer reports that **he was kept away from set while the company investigated and then told his contract had been terminated on the production. His character was then written out for the rest of the series.**\n\n\n\n**Speer\u2019s Response**\n\n&gt; Speer, who\u2019s not worked since, told the Daily Mail: \u201c**It was tragi-comic, but they didn\u2019t realise how badly affected I was. I went into massive, deep shock. As you can see, I\u2019m still kind of there.**\n\n&gt; **\u201cThey\u2019ve taken my job. They\u2019ve taken my reputation. They\u2019ve taken my money. They\u2019ve taken my mental health.\u201d**\n\n\n\n**Disney\u2019s Comment**\n\n&gt; A spokesperson for Disney told the Mail: \u201c**Last year, we were made aware of allegations of inappropriate conduct by Hugo Speer on the set of The Full Monty. As is policy, an independent investigation was launched. Upon its completion, the decision was made to terminate his contract, with immediate effect.**\u201d",

It seems plausible to forget to close the door when changing from one stripper outfit to the next once briefly.

I\u2019m not a big fan of defending guys accused of doing creepy shit to women, but this seems like much more of a leap than seems warranted. \n\nMaybe he was a creepy weirdo exposing himself to women all over set, but genuine mistakes/misunderstandings do also happen, and I see mostly pretty flimsy evidence of any real wrongdoing here.",

Bill was such a great supporter of me from the very beginning,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speak about somebody else\u2019s experience, but he\u2019s really part of my family. You know, he\u2019s my daughter\u2019s godfather. In fact, he actually baptized her. He\u2019s the one who splashed the water.\u201d   \n\n\nI mean I get it. Dude let him be his daughter's godfather. Your probably going to stand by a family member a lot longer then if you don't have a connection with the person.",

Then, he kissed her on the mouth, although when he did so, both Murray and the woman were wearing masks, owing to Covid protocol.\n\n\u201cSitting on top of a woman\u201d, yeah that\u2019s downplaying what happened.

But many times we see someone who still can make us smile and help when we are sad but are still not good people behind closed doors. \n\nI\u2019m sure bill is a amazing dude to party with and be on a show with. He seemed to stand up for women when Chevy chase was being a creep and dick. But Bill also clearly has shit he needs to address also.",

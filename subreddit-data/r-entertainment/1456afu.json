I don't expect the loss of my business to move the needle for them in any way, but I'm also not willing to pay them extra for absolutely no good reason.",

They\u2019ve gotten this complaint a few times already, but the more of us that complain and notice this the better our chances of having it fixed.",

When before you didn't cancel because your cousin also uses it or your siblings or grandma and grandpa and what not. These aren't NEW accounts popping up out of the blue. My guess is this stagnates after this month and slowly bleeds into next year unless they remove the screen amount annoyance or increase the quality of what they put out. Which I don't see them doing. They're high on this now, they're just going to get more greedy. Once again it looks high, but these aren't customers who just decided all at once to start using Netflix, these were the stragglers who are now forced to. There's very few left to market to. We'll see what they do with this.",

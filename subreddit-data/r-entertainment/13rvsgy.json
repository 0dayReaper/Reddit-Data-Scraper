I may only be playing a minor character in a spin-off series, but my contract obligates me to perform the role should it be expanded within the series or if there are further appearances in other series or films. Nothing\u2019s certain, but I guess there\u2019s a few ideas being kicked around that would give my character a recurring supporting role following the Kang Dynasty storyline. There\u2019s also a weird clause about a probable cameo for Morbius 2: Midnight Monster Morbin\u2019. It\u2019s not much, but I\u2019m happy with it.\n\nSuper jealous of my neighbor though, he\u2019s got two voice/motion capture roles and a starring role during the Kang Dynasty plot line in a spin-off series.\n\nMy other neighbor won\u2019t shut up about being an extra in the Secret Invasion series. That guy\u2019s such a tool. You know what\u2019s extra, Steve? You are.",

Your first offer for the role you have no bargaining power as a new talent. Marvel knows this, your agent knows this and you know this. \n\nYou make that first movie and prove yourself then after that you have more power which is why marvel nails you in the beginning with multi movie deals and locking it down more. \n\nEstablished stars have bargaining power not newer talent without much under their belt.",

I\u2019ve had family who were abducted with their cars, and according to them the criminals were very upfront with the fact that they don\u2019t want to hurt them (which would prompt a heavier investigation and become higher risk if they\u2019re caught). Rather, they prefer leaving you in the middle of nowhere to delay police response time more. \n\nMy guess is that his kidnapper\u2019s thought process was the same; they won\u2019t get caught if they just leave him there but they\u2019ll be increasing their own risk if they killed him. \n\nStill though, his balls are massive if he asked them without knowing that.",

None of them have gone public, I can only imagine the trauma they'd have to relive. Cumberbatch is the most high-profile survivor of that ordeal, and because he's spoken about it, the public has only heard his side of it.",

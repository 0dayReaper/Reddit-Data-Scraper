But that's what you're trying to suggest, isn't it, with this ugly attempt at Whataboutism. That if she did that, then it justifies her being beat (and r\\*ped) because she \"deserved it\". \n2. No, she literally was not proven to have done that. This is not opinion. This is not debatable. She was never proven in court to have done that because *she was never on trial for that, or any other act of alleged \"abuse\" Depp claimed*. She was on trial for one thing and one thing only, which was *defamation*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you get that? Do you get that a verdict of defamation is not magically also proof of every other accusation anyone ever made against her? Even if you take the Virginia verdict at face value, ignoring all the ways it trampled over due process and the First Amendment, and ignoring the UK verdict and the appeals, Amber Heard was never proven to have done that or any other form of abuse because *she was literally not on trial for that*. Even if Depp didn't abuse her, it wouldn't prove that she actually abused him. ***SHE WAS NEVER ON TRIAL FOR THAT.***\n\nWhereas the reason Depp is a court-proven wife-beater is that in the UK, the trial was literally about the Sun calling him a wife-beater, and they used truth as a defense, and under UK law the burden of proof in a defamation case is on the defendant, not the plaintiff, and the Judge found that they had proved Depp was a wife-beater to the civil standard. And this was upheld on appeal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, their dog had a long history of shitting on things, Depp had a long history of thinking shitting on things is funny, and Amber was therefore literally the least likely person there to have done that, especially since Depp wasn't even living there at the time so it wouldn't even have affected him.

Heard will be in Sicily along with the film\u2019s director Conor Allyn and co-star Eduardo Noriego. The film will premiere June 24 at the Teatro Antico di Taorina. The fest takes place June 23-July 1, 2023 in Sicily.\n\nIn the Fire\u00a0is described as a supernatural thriller that stars Heard as a pioneering psychiatrist who sets out to treat a desperate child at a time when psychiatry is not yet a respected science. Set in 1899, the film follows a 38-year-old American psychiatrist as she arrives on a rich farm in Colombia after being called to solve the case of a disturbed child following increasingly insistent accusations that the child is the devil. While the woman tries to psychoanalyze the child, the nefarious events intensify and her \u201ccure\u201d becomes a race to save the little boy from the fury of his fellow citizens, and perhaps, even from himself.\n\nPrevious works from Allyn include the IFC Films western\u00a0No Man\u2019s Land\u00a0starring Frank Grillo, George Lopez and Andie Macdowell. Allyn also previously directed Netflix Originals\u00a0Walk. Ride. Rodeo,\u00a0and he was executive producer on\u00a0I\u2019m No Longer Here.\n\nIt will be the first film promoted by Heard after a legal battle with former husband Johnny Depp. Now, Heard\u2019s priority is to put the attention on her film career.\n\nThe festival\u2019s newly appointed Executive and Co-Artistic Director, Barrett Wissman, announced the lineup for the 69th\u00a0Taormina Film Festival\u00a0earlier this month, with additional screenings and events to be added. The event, which has a rich history as one of Italy\u2019s premier festivals, is now on the comeback trail after some quieter years. Past premieres include\u00a0La Dolce Vita, The Godfather, Braveheart, Mission Impossible, Inglourious Basterds\u00a0and many more.\n\nAmong the Taormina slate is the Italian premiere of the James Mangold-directed\u00a0Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, with Harrison Ford, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies, and Mads Mikkelsen in attendance. Also on the slate is the Edoardo Leo/Massimiliano Bruno-directed\u00a0The Worst Days; the world premiere of\u00a0Billie\u2019s Magic World, directed by Francesco Cinquemani and featuring Alec Baldwin, William Baldwin, Valeria Marini, Mia McGovern Zaini, Soraya Azzabi, and Elva Trill; the international premiere of Sundance pic\u00a0Divinity, directed by Eddie Alcazar, the world premiere of\u00a0Lo Sposo Indeciso, directed by Giorgio Amato; the Italian premiere of the Lisa Cortes-directed\u00a0Little Richard: I Am Everything; the Italian premiere of\u00a0A Thousand and One,\u00a0directed by A.V. Rockwell and featuring Teyana Taylor; and the Italian premiere of Cannes opener\u00a0Jeanne du Barry, directed by and starring Ma\u00efwenn alongside Johnny Depp.\n\nThe festival will also feature a career retrospective on John Landis, and Willem Dafoe and director Abel Ferrara, including showings of the seven films they made together. Taormina will also fete the 90th\u00a0anni celebration of Warner Bros, showing 25 of its greatest films over the last 90 years.\n\nThe festival opens with the\u00a0Pavarotti Forever\u00a0opening gala at the Teatro Antico di Taormina, benefitting the Luciano Pavarotti Foundation. The evening will feature clips of concerts and documentaries over the years, with special guests and luminaries from both the operatic and pop world. Bella Thorne will curate a gala evening of short films.",

My kid did a dance recital and we gave all the kids a nice standing ovation. Maybe 30 seconds. That\u2019s all you need. Point made. By minute two everyone would be like \u201cwtf are we doing? When can we stop?\u201d \n\nI want to see a documentary about the brave people who somehow ends these absurd ovations every time they go this long.",

If you\u2019re talking about dramas, then yes, it\u2019s true that these days most dramas lean towards a serialized format, but there are still some episodic dramas out there. Law and Order is still on. But the fact is, people crave more than that. We as a people have been enjoying novels for centuries now. Huge stories with long, evolving narratives, enriching characters, and often a premise that is huge in scope. It\u2019s ingrained in our DNA to crave these kinds of stories. Serialized television is the visual medium\u2019s answer to this craving, and it answers it in a way that a 2 or even 3 hour film simply cannot, and 30 minute self-contained episode *definitely* cannot.\n\nA season of serialized shows is essentially a volume of book series, and each episode a chapter. You get sucked into binging a great serialized show in the same way that you get sucked into tearing through a great book. You find yourself saying \u201cJust one more episode\u201d before bed in the same way as you find yourself saying \u201cJust one more chapter.\u201d You can\u2019t wait to find out what happens next, and when you get to the end, you feel both accomplished from the journey you\u2019ve gone on and sad that the journey is over. It\u2019s both addicting and rewarding. It scratches the exact same itch that we\u2019ve always been scratching. Episodic dramas have their place and they can be nice when you really find yourself wanting a short, condensed story, but by and large, that\u2019s not what people generally crave on a day to day basis.",

She bows, they clap, she leaves the stage, they keep clapping, she comes back, more clapping, finally the first encore, then more clapping, leaves, comes back, clapping, clapping, second encore, and on and on.  Hilary Hahn is my favorite classical musician, but it's too much.",

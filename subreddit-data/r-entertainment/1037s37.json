Someone who was a bit obtuse and rude because of it, but he\u2019s doing that with his limited knowledge and best intentions. \n\nI even forgot most of his dumb lines until he mentioned it, so I hope he realises some people remember Drax differently than just a pun maker",

Like he had moved on from that sadness. But then, when mantis felt his emotions and was barely able to keep it together from the sadness she felt from him despite his stoic nature, it made the scene unforgettable to me. and it's one of the reasons gotg2 is my favorite mcu film.",

You can forget that this guy has a tragic backstory, so they remind you that he's not a moron or anything, nor does he lack emotional depth, and they do it in a somewhat restrained way for the actor.",

That reminds me of when my CEO handed down way too much work for the amount of people we had, said it was two \"hell\" weeks we just had to get through and we would all be rewarded in the end, and then it turned into about 8 \"hell\" months, with no raises, OT pay, or bonuses. \n\nPeople were absolutely losing their minds working crazy hours under extreme stress. I (as a middle manager) brought this to him and he said he'd take care of it. So he scheduled an hour-long all-hands meeting for everyone to discuss healthy coping mechanisms for stress. \"Okay, Sara, what do you think is a good coping mechanism?\" \"Um... Laughter?\" \"Yes! Very good! Okay now you, Bill.\" Like we're children.\n\nLost about half the team over the next 6 months. I think everybody updated their resume after that meeting.",

Guardians 1 Drax is a fantastic character and everything later is comic relief. \n\nOne of Dave Bautista's most memorable IMO is Blade Runner 2049. He's in that movie for all of 2 minutes and he slays it. It's one of the best scenes in a movie full of best scenes.",

He jumps down the monster's throat, he jumps out the back of the ship... he wants to die in a glorious battle saving his friends. That's why the scene with Mantis trying to comfort him and being overwhelmed by his grief hit home so much. He seems composed and sentimental because of his stoicism, but Mantis can actually tell how destroyed he is.\n\nAnd that's what makes his ultimate decision in the end of the movie so significant. They're a family now, he has people he cares about again. Cheesy lines aside, it actually works as an arc. It's just easy to miss because the story gets wrapped up in everyone else's arcs. Really hard to do a movie with **six** major characters (Quill, Rocket, Drax, Gammora, Nebula, Yondu) who all need to have their own arc with a satisfying conclusion.\n\nI do wonder if there were bits left on the cutting room floor that showed it more directly that were deemed too dark or just too distracting.",

It wasn't until after his death that the media kind of went and said \"oopsy, we kind of misquoted this a bit\".\n\nI am still salty about how this hero of so many kids was treated, and you still sometimes hear people tell the \"fun fact\" that he \"actually hated kids\".",

I guess since people responded to it, it just got amplified in GOTG 2. He stopped being funny because he was too literal and more started being a dumb joke. His scenes started becoming more painful to watch. His best stuff are things like his \"some people are dancers\" with Quill and the Mantis stuff that shows the pain he feels underneath.\n\nAnother unfortunate thing is they just neutered a lot of his motivation because IW and Endgame just had too much to do. Drax never felt powerful, he never felt like he got his real moment to come to a satisfying conclusion. It might have just been nice if he was more involved in the scene where Tony gets the stones from Thanos. While he doesn't get the final blow, maybe he was a distraction enough to let it happen.",

It's fantastic, he's a great actor, I am just worried he is getting pigeon holed into the \"big tough looking guy has a twist to him though\" kinda roles. Big tough macho guy in glass onion is ||cuckolding himself to advance a failing career||. The giant scary red alien is a sweet heart. I absolutely want to see him in more dramatic roles, and while I think that Duke as a character is a step in that direction, as you said, he's still just goofy.\n\nEdit:We will get to see him as the beast Rabban more in the next Dune movie but not enough!",

The have more opportunity to have range or do things that shock the audience or actively make the audience dislike them. The main actor, generally, needs to be the more grounded and realistic character for the audience to relate to. I am not saying this is always the case (joker is a good example), but i would say it is the general default of how a movie is main characters are portrayed.",

I think that shows a lot of maturity as an actor when you come straight from the action and action-comedy scene like he has. It's easy to just keep being the muscle-head in an action movie. It's steady and consistent and that can make the decision to leave it and pursue more experimental and emotional roles a challenge. Good for him in deciding to make that leap.",

I was watching Captain America: Winter Soldier recently and it's far more balanced with seriousness and comedy. Now every single character has to be comedic. They'll have an evil villain come out of a chamber and he has to bunk his head a few times and be all confused while they play funny sound effects over it.  Its one of the reasons I loved WandaVision because it didn't rely on constant comedy. And the comedy it had felt fluid. But much of the comedy in that show had creepy undertones in it.",

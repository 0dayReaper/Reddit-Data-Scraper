To them, sex is as follows: \u2018A woman gets so turned on because a man exists, then something messy and weird happens in the middle (We won\u2019t say what it is, but trust us, we've definitely had sex before) And then finally, when it's all over, she lets them know that was the best time she's ever had.'\n\nThat's gold, Jerry.",

Never actually obsessed over them or anything, I think it was just the sexual thrill aspect/status thing?, but anyway-she said most of the guys that weren\u2019t, like, normal at some point before they blew up were mostly just *bad* at sex. I guess because they never had to care enough about the woman, or something about the novelty, idk I\u2019m sure there are a *ton* of reasons - but yeah. She usually went for comedians or athletes because the musicians/actors were coldly transactional (and usually the least \u201cnormal\u201d). Athletes, weirdly (to me anyway), were the ones that seemed to enjoy the actual conversation/foreplay and would talk her up and flirt and stuff. And they enjoyed the sex for the physicality of it. Comedians, while sometimes good or bad, had a personality and communicated, and seemed to care if she was participating/enjoyed it- so overall it was a good time for her. None of that from actors/musicians. \n\nThis is based on her take from, idk, maybe 25-30 guys - so not a giant sample pool I know.",

I know it\u2019s supposed to be about exploitation. They\u2019ve *definitely* covered that in the show so far. It seems really aimless though. \n\nNow what I will say is that she is absolutely gorgeous, and if she wants to share her body with the world, I\u2019m not hating on her choice. But relying on her sex appeal to float the show is pathetic of the writers and directors. There is also definitely a big double standard between the male and female nudity and power roles. \n\nAnd I actually enjoy the Weekend\u2019s music (don\u2019t hate), but I feel like he bought his way into this gig or something. I don\u2019t think the casting director had much say in picking him. He needs a little work.",

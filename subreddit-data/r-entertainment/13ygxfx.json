Drew's character was middle class, but even when he was management he was always on the side of the workers. Drew Carey doing something like this doesn't surprise given the ethos that clearly comes through on The Drew Carey Show.",

Basically, they're not saying that Rowe is evil in and of himself, but more he's a paid shill by the Kochs and similar groups and a lot of what he's going around parroting is specifically their propaganda, which is itself incredibly anti-worker and anti-union. specifically three big points:\n\n1) he's anti-regulation, saying things like OSHA get in the way, when this is pure Koch nonsense since those regulatory agencies are there to protect people from abusive employers like the Kochs, who have staggering amounts of EPA and Osha violations and regularly have their workers and innocent people maimed, killed, or poisened around their factories. \n\n2) anti-union: kind of the crux of this thread. most of his push is saying there should be more non-union labor and unions no longer serve a purpose, despite being in a union and seeing first hand it's benefits. (another narrative that helps bad employers)\n\n3) anti-education / pushes the skills gap narrative. saying we need more people with vocational training or going for blue-collar jobs isn't inherently bad, but it's only good if those jobs are well-paid. the reason most of them are not being filled is that most of them pay shit. and if there is a flood of under-educated applicants to these jobs without strong union protections, (and poor regulatory oversight to boot) then managers will be able to keep wages extremely low and they have no chance of achieving a better life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing right-wing isn't necessarily evil, but being a spokesman and a purveyor of right-wing propaganda, intentionally or unintentionally, starts to push you into that category.",

If they wanted to put it on streaming they either have to A) pay for the rights to the music *again*, B) change the music to something else, or C) not release the show to streaming.\n\nWhich one gets picked depends on the show, the company, and the cost(s).",

We like to say that America has a large middle class, but what America HAD was a financially stable and prosperous working class for the bulk of the mid 20th Century.\n\nPeople could work good union jobs and afford a home and a family on one working class income.\n\nIf you look at the middle class, traditionally, before that period it was really doctors, lawyers, and small business owner types. People who are successful but not quite independently rich.\n\nThe working class was already on the downswing in the 90s when The Drew Carey Show was on. 25 years later it's a lot worse.\n\nWith the income inequality rise since the Reagan era the only people who are effectively living a middle class lifestyle are doctors and lawyers again, and tech people. Depending on where you live you have to have a six figure salary to live a middle class lifestyle.",

One time a girl I knew used her dad\u2019s military discount to get a hotel at the ritz Carlton in Cleveland, so like twelve 21 year old girls all put down 20 dollars and used the rest of our money to go get hammered on W 6th street. The next morning, we all pile bleary eyed into an elevator, mascara streaked and sweating out four lokos and vodka. There was one man standing quietly in the corner while we all sobbed about how hungover we were and how much we did not belong in the fancy hotel elevator that had a chandelier. The guy is the corner is trying hard to be polite but can\u2019t control his laughter. We get to the lobby and we all burst out. Guy in the corner says \u201cenjoy the rest of your day, girls. Drink some water!\u201d It was Drew Carey. I\u2019ll always have a soft spot for him and I hope he laughs about us from time to time.",

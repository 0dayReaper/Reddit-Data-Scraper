The western film as a genre pre-dates Kirosawa's birth by about 30 years and westerns were incredibly popular in the silent film era. In fact, many of the \"famous\" cowboys from the end of the American West era only became famous because they told the script writers tall tales about their days while working as hands on set- anything from working with horses to stunt riding to shooting and roping to construction. \n\nNow, if you wanted to say that Kurosawa's work deeply influenced and altered Westerns produced after the early 1960s that would be true. He influenced the American Western both directly with Seven Samurai and Rashomon (among others) and indirectly via his influence on Italian spaghetti western director Sergio Leone. Both of whose work profoundly altered the nature of the genre.",

The only thing she did wrong was be a uber rich name for somebody to forge. But thanks to everything else she and her husband had done, nobody cared that she was innocent. They just assumed she used her influence to rig the courts. \n\nIf she and the royals hadn't been so ridiculously wasteful and out of touch, the public may have listened when the courts ruled that she wasn't at fault at all.\n\nIn Kim's case, she didn't do anything to deserve to be robbed. But considering how wasteful and vapid her image is, it's not surprising that somebody got resentful, and took their frustration to an extreme level. There are definitely some parallels between Kim's public image and Marie Antoinette's.",

And it's not like it was a bunch of Robin Hoods trying to help the poor -- they sound like professionals.\n\nShe was on *My Next Guest Needs No Introduction* with David Letterman and talked about it. Literally the fist time I've ever watched anything with a Kardashian except for half an episode of their show like 15 years ago. I get that people think a lot about them is just acting and PR but it was gut-wrenching when she spoke about the robbery. To hear a woman talking about how she felt bad that her sisters would find her  dead body and \"this is when I get raped\" (for anyone not aware, she was not sexually assaulted but the thieves made her completely undress and restrained her before having her get in the tub which sure sounds like a prelude to getting raped and murdered). She also felt a kind of relief, after the fact, that it happened to her and not the other two b/c she felt like she could handle the trauma better than they would have (not in a condescending way but in the \"what if\" ways our brains can't help and thinking it would have emotionally destroyed people that she loved).\n\n*\\*I understand when security experts/people with more savvy about this speak in terms of steps celebs can take to prevent being targeted in a constructive way. But that's not where most of these comments are coming from.*",

No. Is a fool and their money soon parted?  Yes.  Is having a gun pulled on you a traumatic experience?

Her being obnoxious doesn\u2019t warrant the trauma of being held at gun point though.",

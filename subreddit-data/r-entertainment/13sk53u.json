The movie games almost always fail terribly and you are just going to ruin the genre for the next decade by over saturating the market. Rather see some new stories with the same concept (gun-fu and old school 90\u2019s action).",

JW4 was less confusing than JW2 and JW3, but the plot still felt half-baked.\n\nI also don't like that John is now a superhuman who can just magically be okay after being repeatedly run over by cars.",

It gets to a point where you\u2019re just watching a dude playing a video game with God mode on. It\u2019s fun but my concern with getting a *\u201dregular cadence of Wick films\u201d* it risks becoming another Fast X Furious. It\u2019ll all be well made for sure but always getting one step further away from the comparatively more grounded well made action of the first.\n\n*That\u2019s why I\u2019d prefer they let John rest, focus on a spin off of a new character maybe one who isn\u2019t as powerful so you can reset the \u201cpower level\u201d so to speak.* Akira from JW4 was great, you could focus on her revenge story but having her navigate an underworld totally upended by John\u2019s war so we still feel some progression moving from JW4.",

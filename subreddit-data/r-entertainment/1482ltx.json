Throughout her later life, she denied having known about the Holocaust, and was criticized as the \"voice of the 'how could we have known?' defense.\"[7][9]\n\n[8] Kakutani, Michiko (13 May 2007). \"Triumph of Willful Blindness to the Horror of History\". The New York Times. Riefenstahl would repeatedly ignore or deny news reports of anti-Semitic atrocities in Germany. Mr. Bach reports that she claimed not to believe reports about Kristallnacht, shrugging it off as slander on her homeland, and that during a 1938-39 trip to the United States, she told a reporter that as an artist she could not be expected to know about events, even if the rest of the world did. . . . In 1940, with the fall of Paris, Riefenstahl wrote Hitler an ecstatic telegram: 'With indescribable joy, deeply moved and filled with burning gratitude, we share with you, my F\u00fchrer, your and Germany's greatest victory, the entry of German troops into Paris. You exceed anything human imagination has the power to conceive, achieving deeds without parallel in the history of mankind.' This from a woman who wanted history to see her simply as an artist, who falsely denied ever making anti-Semitic statements, who implausibly claimed she knew next to nothing about Hitler's persecution of the Jews, a woman who never acknowledged moral accountability for the role her movies played in promoting Hitler and his cause . . .",

Now assume we were told by those same people some other group was evil, if everyone told us that we'd have no reason to distrust them.\n\nAs information becomes more readily available it's easier to learn the truth, but when realizing back then it was hard, it's possible to understand without saying it was okay or correct.",

He was old enough for that he started working at the parks while Walt was very much alive, and worked with both Roys closely after that, later becoming a high level senior executive for Disney himself.\n\nI asked him about this once, and he said that while Walt may have been a bit of a xenophobe, he did a hell of a lot of work to increase the stature of women, gay men, and even African Americans, in the entertainment industry. Don't forget Walt hired the first black man to receive any Oscar, which was for a Disney film, had women up and down the parks division creating things for Disneyland, projects that never happened, and even what would eventually become Magic Kingdom, and knew that a good chunk of his imagineering staff was gay (Bob Gurr, who I haven't yet met, is one example) and seemingly did nothing about it even though he could have. And that's not even talking about the fact that he often hired, African-American, lesbian, bisexual, or gay entertainers for Disneyland, and they appeared on Wonderful World of Disney often alongside him. He certainly was not, at least in terms of his business activities, a hateful man.\n\nI didn't just take his work for it, or the word of a lot of people he worked with, I made my own conclusions and found essentially the same thing.",

I think my favorite part about the last season was the fact that it felt like they had a little fun with character combinations for different scenes and it was such a TREAT every single time. even when the actors had no lines, their facial expressions and body languages conveyed so much. you could teach a college acting course off of this show tbh",

I\u2019ve never seen a show or movie where both hit on all cylinders for humanities benefit. God I will miss that show. But it was such a treat watching the actors just so thoroughly give everything they have to what they do. Mattson was so fucking sleazy but yet hyper intelligent. What a treat that had to have been to play",

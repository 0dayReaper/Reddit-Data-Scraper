            "comment": "\u201cHocus Pocus 3\u201d is casting its spell.\n\nFollowing Sunday\u2019s announcement that the Disney+ sequel from last fall is now getting a sequel of its own, TheWrap has learned that film\u2019s director Anne Fletcher and writer Jen D\u2019Angelo will be returning to the witchy franchise.\n\nThe news of a new \u201cHocus Pocus\u201d sequel, after last year\u2019s surprisingly enjoyable follow-up to the 1993 Disney classic, came during a profile of Walt Disney Studios president Sean Bailey\u00a0in The New York Times. Bailey confirmed that there was another film in development \u2014 although, at the time, not much else was known.\n\nIt\u2019s currently unclear, for instance, if original stars Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker will be back for \u201cHocus Pocus 3,\u201d or if other actors from the first film who skipped \u201cHocus Pocus 2\u201d (like Omri Katz, Vinessa Shaw and Jason Marsden) will return for the new movie. (In February of this year, Midler said that she wasn\u2019t sure that she\u2019d come back,\u00a0telling E! News: \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d) Another looming question: whether the new movie will go straight to Disney+ or if the studio will get a theatrical release.\n\nThe original \u201cHocus Pocus,\u201d about a trio of witches brought back to life in modern day Salem, opened in the summer of 1993. It was a box office disappointment but grew in esteem over the years, first thanks to home video and then thanks to streaming and repeated airings on The Disney Channel and Freeform. Now the film, directed by Kenny Ortega and cowritten by Mick Garris, is a bona fide Halloween favorite. And, of course, the continued appreciation of the film eventually led to sequel talk, which finally solidified when the company launched its direct-to-consumer streaming platform Disney+. (Other Disney+ sequels/franchise extensions include \u201cZombies 3,\u201d \u201cDisenchanted,\u201d \u201cNight at the Museum: Kahmunrah Rises Again\u201d and \u201cThe Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild.\u201d)\n\nWith support for Disney+ cooling, it\u2019ll be interesting to see whether the Sanderson Sisters will fly again on the streaming platform or invade cinemas nationwide. Amok! Amok! Amok!",

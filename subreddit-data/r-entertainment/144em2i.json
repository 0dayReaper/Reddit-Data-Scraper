It\u2019s not clear if he actually says \u201ctemporary retirement\u201d which seems like a fair alternate phrasing to sabbatical, or if he never uses the word retire at all.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s also worth mentioning that even if he did use the word retirement, I think it fits because he\u2019s not just going on extended vacation. Per the article, he is shuttering his production company and selling his share in the Mezcal joint venture with Aaron Paul. It\u2019s entirely possible he will decide not to return to his former life, as would be his right and well deserved.",

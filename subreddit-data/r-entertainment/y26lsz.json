That was what was lacking in that incarnation. It was too much of a straight-ahead horror movie. \u2018The Mummy\u2019 should be a thrill ride, but not terrifying and scary.\u201d  \n\n&gt;\u201cI know how difficult it is to pull it off. I tried to do it three times.\u201d",

We went into Cruise's Mummy with the memory of Frasier's Mummy films, but what we got was something completely different.\n\nHad they started with Jekel and Hyde, Frankenstein, or Dracula, or another \"new\" IP, they would have set us up to expect the darker tone of The Mummy. Then our comparison would be with whichever films they'd started with and not a series of comedy movies.",

Not only does it succeed at doing what sequels are supposed to do - the first movie, but more/again - it actually keeps things fresh without spending a ton of time retreading the first one. Imhotep takes almost the entire first movie to come to full power, but in Mummy 2 he's back to full strength within 30 minutes. All of our returning characters have actually grown - Evie of course can hold her own in combat, Jonathan has several great callbacks and his sport shooting skills become invaluable, Ardeth Bay becomes a fully fledged character.\n\nThe Mummy 2 is a better sequel than most franchises ever receive.",

Del Toro constantly gets the helm for projects that should end up amazing and maintains his artistic integrity and fucking walks when he doesn't get his way.

We didn\u2019t leave the hotel much because it has its own beach and went to two excursions. One to see pyramids and the sphinx and Kairo museum and the other to visit Karnak (where ofc I had to do the Inhotep impersonation when he arrived there in mummy 2) and Valley of the Kings. It was in the middle of summer so it was blazing hot, but it was still awesome. But yeah, as a woman, I didn\u2019t feel confident leaving hotel alone, i didn\u2019t hear about any incindents but it just felt safer to stay put i guess. But some other tourists from our group did go out by taxis and went around to shop and didn\u2019t have any problems. Vendors are pushy so the best is to ignore them unless you\u2019re interested. Sea is also amazing. So stuff to see there is very awesome and I would recommend going there, to conclude this novel. :D",

            "comment": "You know, The Mummy from 1999 might have actually served as a good starting point for a \"Dark Universe\", albeit with a lighthearted bend. After all, Stephen Sommers went on to direct Van Helsing after The Mummy Returns, which had its own spin-off in The Scorpion King. Brendan Fraser could have even worked as the \"straight man\" of that universe, he has comedic timing and possesses a certain everyman charisma.\n\nIn these times in which no IP is entirely disposable, you could still make the idea work. Maybe hire Sommers back, or someone as witty as Edgar Wright, or at least reliable, like Matthew Vaughn.",

It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s got high flying action, adventure, romance, drama! Are the characters total archetypal tropes? Yeah, but they\u2019re fun and so well done. They really lean into those tropes and it feels like a real sincere effort to have a good time and tell a fun story. I actually think Van Helsing does this as well, maybe to a different extent. \n\nI had this conversation with my husband fairly recently. I really wish there were more of these types of fun, swashbuckling adventure movies. Sometimes I want something dark, sometimes I want something goofy, but there\u2019s something just so magical about movies like The Mummy. It\u2019s hard to replicate and do right.",

His trilogy is a lot closer to Indiana Jones than it was to Bram Stroker's Dracula.  It wasn't a horror movie so much as it was a bit of a campy adventure movie that had elements of horror.\n\nI'd even argue that the poor aging of the special effects only adds to it's charm.  Aging into a bit of a \"B-Movie\" kind of fits.  \n\nOf course I don't know how that really fits into what Universal wanted to do with the Monsterverse or whatever they were calling it.  Maybe The Mummy was just the wrong launch vehicle.  Maybe they would have been better off casting Cruise as Dracula and starting there.",

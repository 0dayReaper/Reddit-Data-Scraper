Kevin says how the type of pen you would never use for fear of losing it. Plus it is a gift from Tom Cruise, so you are building a cabinet with lights to put it in. The next day Kevin is on set and Cruise comes up and asks where the pen is? 'Oh it was such a nice gift I don't want anything to happen to it etc.' Later, Kevin is in his trailer waiting for his call and there is a knock on the door. It is Tom Cruise's assistant with a second pen. 'Mr. Cruise would like you to use this pen.' For sure Cruise is a wackadoodle, but there are lots of stories like that where he goes out of his way to do nice things for people. Emily Blunt has a story from Edge of Tomorrow. She says that Tom Cruise has more energy and positivity than ten people. They had a particularly hard day filming. She said it was the first time she had ever seen Cruise less than enthusiastic. She said to him 'boy this is a hard day today' Cruise said something along the lines of 'yes it is a little bit challenging.'",

He even told George Lucas to kill the character off, and there are interviews with him in the early 80's where he admits that he hates the character and he would never play Solo again. I don't recall what they paid him for A New Beginning, but I bet it was conditional upon them killing off Solo.\n\nIndiana Jones was the complete opposite, he loves that character.",

Those people are brain-washed to an extent that is hard to fathom for us. They are often born into Co$, sign \"billion year\" contracts and b/c they usually have no proper education, let alone financial or social independence, they work to serve. They would be acutely aware of the repercussions for speaking up against Cruise.\n\nThis [AMA by a former Co$ Sea Org member](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/185j1y/iama_former_member_of_scientologys_sea_org_ama/) is pretty interesting.\n\nGoing Clear by Lawrence Wright is also a great -- and oftentimes infuriating -- read about Scientology. There's also the HBO documentary of the same name based on the book.\n\nWright made sure to include the anecdote about Sea Org members planting an entire field of wild flowers for Cruise to take Nicole running through. It's romantic until you realize it was done by, essentially, slaves.",

He seemed like a true believer, but being a true believer basically cost him his celebrity. He still makes movies and all that and he\u2019s still obviously famous, but he can\u2019t really do interviews anymore and  for one of the worlds biggest celebrities, you never really see him as much as you\u2019d think. He doesn\u2019t get that \u201cpublic lauding / praise\u201d that he used to get, and that\u2019s what he wants\u2014it\u2019s like a drug.

He used to be #2 right behind the leader David Miscavage, but it\u2019s been years since that info was made public, and things can change. Either way he\u2019s not a nobody, and Scientology has the Sea Org, which is basically an organization of complete servitude to men like Cruise and Miscavage, forever. Getting out of the mental framework that cults indoctrinate you in is very difficult, and I doubt Cruise has ever had a real reason to want to. He\u2019s rich, Scientology gives him friends in high places, and the cult provides everything he needs. He likely only ever sees people who gush about how Scientology helped them, because that\u2019s how the cult operates. Scientology utilizes real and beneficial therapeutic techniques that are secular in nature and can improve your life. They recruit lost people in places like Narcotics Anonymous, give them practical advice and therapy, slap on a Scientology label, and then indoctrinate you. That\u2019s why so many people speak good of Scientology, because it really did help them, it\u2019s just that nothing practical Scientology has to offer is proprietary or strictly religious/spiritual. \n\n\nBesides, when you learn about Scientology, you learn they believe in an immortal soul of sorts. The only reason humans get sick and die is because evil alien spirits called thetans reside in your body, and cause sicknesses. If you get rid of them all, you in theory should be immortal. Well, Tom Cruise certainly pulls off stunts and acts like a man who believe he\u2019s immortal \u2014 less like a man trapped within an evil cult desperate to escape.",

He is kind to crew and co actors. \n\nPersonally, he\u2019s a mess of a human with questionable views and a sense of self importance that is unrivaled. This makes him incredibly unappealing to the masses.\n\nYet he has a tremendous work ethic. He stays fit, he does his own stunts, and he\u2019s always pushing boundaries for in screen action sequences. This makes his movies watchable and enjoyable.\n\nIn my opinion, he is one of the great classic examples of loving the actor and hating the person.",

Yeah Red Flags literally everywhere.\n\nHumans are complex.\n\nIf I had to guess Tom Cruise personally never hurt nobody but his views and his die-hard advertisment of Scientology + spreading conspiracies and fake news cannot be overlooked.\n\nIt's one of those people that you have seperate the Art from The Arist and not care what they really talk about. It's like with any professional. Actors are nothing special, they very rarely have realistic outlook on society.\n\nTom Cruise is more of a product than a human being at this stage. He has been abused by so many instututions be it in holywood or in church that no one knows who Tom Cruise really is.\n\nI think the best is to just let him live do his work and eventually die in obscurity. No one should ever take him seriously.",

He was setting the standard in a serious situation where people could easily be put out of a job again because of a couple people's negligence. \n\nNow do I want to hangout with the guy after work \"he'll no\" but not a bad guy to have on your team when it comes to your livelihood.",

He doesn't seem intellectually curious to me, or like someone who cultivates a lot of outside interests or hobbies. \n\nI think it's partly why he was so easily roped in to the Scientology thing. \n\nHe's looking for easy answers to a world which may be difficult for him to navigate on his own. \n\n*\"So, what kind of movies do you like?\"* \n\n\"Hmm, man, I dunno, just like, *movies,* ya know?

The writer conveniently left out the reason that Cruise was melting down and it was because crew members weren\u2019t following the mask mandates set by the Covid Department. He was screaming because the show was going to get shut down and that tirade ended with \u201cyou can tell it to the people that are losing their fucking homes because our industry is shut down.\u201d \n\nI work in film and the early Covid protocols were extremely stringent because no one had ever dealt with anything like this before while making movies. Filmmaking is a close quarters business and suddenly we were wearing masks and face shields with (face shields if close to talent), having to stay 6 feet apart (the Covid department would walk around with sticks 6 feet long and push them in between us if we were too close together whether we were rolling or not), with surveillance cables fed under the mask (the departments talk to each other via walkie talkies) and getting tested 5 days a week for Covid (as many as 7 days per week depending on our schedule). Let me be clear that I don\u2019t fault the Covid department for doing what they did because it allowed us to work. There were plenty of shows that were shut down for not following protocols.\n\nI\u2019ll 100% agree that he comes off as super weird, but most celebrities come off that way to me. It\u2019s a mistake to think of them as normal people because the way they have to live their lives and how they are treated is far from normal. Obviously not all of them are this way, but Cruise is one of the biggest celebrities in existence.",

He is currently in prison for possessing child sexual abuse materials (including some horrific videos). Jinger is one of his victims.  \n\nHe was sent to stay with several different families and at least 2 men (each from a different house Josh stayed in) have been convicted of similar crimes.  They are all members of a cult that protects pedophiles and abuses children. There's a lot of these guys in this cult that are convicted rapists and child molesters.",

                                    "comment": "The eldest sister Jill complained about the abuse and was silenced by her parents.  After a few years of Josh's abuse he started abusing the youngest sister openly,  literally sexually abused her during bible study while she sat on his lap with others around.  She was a toddler at that time.\n\nThe girls were shamed and openly blamed for the abuse they suffered.  They were even forced to apologize to their abuser for tempting him.  This happened in their huge house in front of dozens of people from their social circle. The parents and their church kept this quiet and he was not punished for what he did to his sisters,  ever. He was sent to stay with other people,  and unfortunately a few of those men were pedophiles too. In fact one of the law enforcement officers who Josh stayed with is currently in prison for pretty much the rest of his life because he was collecting and distributing CSAM. This guy is very likely the one who taught Josh how to obtain the CSAM he was ultimately imprisoned for. \n\nOprah Winfrey was going to have them on her show because they had a reality TV show.  But she stopped the interview and contacted CPS because someone contacted her and told her what was going on.  It's possible that it was a church member or Josh's other non relative victim.  The 4 sisters were abused by their brother,  neglected and blamed by their parents,  and shamed by their church. \nThe only victim who really knew what was happening was Jill, she was the oldest victim.  The other 3 girls were very young.  Jill was going to testify against Josh at his trial,  but didn't need to because the woman who Josh confessed everything to testified instead. The youngest victim didn't even know just how bad she was abused until the trial.  That's where the truth finally came out and a couple of the girls are finally supported enough to speak out.\n\nEither way: this family and the cult kept this sexual abuse a secret as well as the countless other sexual predators in their midst.  It's a pedophile cult.",

Poor woman has raised nearly all her siblings and a number of their children.  If she were to marry in her late 30s, God could only bless her with a few children before her ovaries close up shop.  Technically in compliance, but she doesn\u2019t end up with an insane amount of kids.  And let\u2019s be honest- if you had eighteen siblings, would you want a ton of kids?\n\nThat\u2019s assuming that her parents didn\u2019t mentally designate her the loyal spinster daughter who stays at home to care for them in their old age.",

            "comment": "Apple Original Films and Skydance are continuing to build on their strong ties with another star-studded project as sources tell Deadline the two are partnering on the action-adventure tentpole\u00a0Mayday\u00a0with\u00a0Ryan Reynolds\u00a0and\u00a0Kenneth Branagh\u00a0starring and Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley directing. Sources tell Deadline the script has been done for some time, well before the WGA Strike started.\n\nThe feature is based on an original pitch from Goldstein and Daley, who came to Skydance earlier this year with the idea and had been developing prior to Apple\u2019s involvement. Once Reynolds showed interest in April to join the pic,\u00a0Mayday\u00a0started gaining serious momentum and while a start date is still undetermined, seems likely this could be the next thing Reynolds shoots.\n\nThe logline is being kept under wraps.\n\nHailing from a first-look partnership between Apple and Skydance Media,\u00a0Mayday\u00a0will be produced by Skydance\u2019s David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Don Granger alongside Reynolds, Ashley Fox, Johnny Pariseau and Patrick Gooing for Maximum Effort. In addition to writing and directing, Goldstein and Daley will serve as producers. Carin Sage will oversee the project for Skydance.\n\nThe film also reunites Apple with Reynolds, who starred in the hit Christmas musical\u00a0Spirited, which bowed on Thanksgiving. It also starred Will Ferrell and at the time was the biggest film to premiere on Apple TV+. He also has strong ties with Skydancem which produced his hit Netflix sci-fi adventure\u00a0The Adam Project.\n\nReynolds is filming\u00a0Deadpool 3\u00a0for Marvel Studios, and his Paramount pic\u00a0Imaginary Friends\u00a0is set to bow next year.\n\nBranagh next will be be seen in Christopher Nolan\u2019s\u00a0Oppenheimer, opening July 21. This September he stars in and directs\u00a0A Haunting in Venice, the latest installment in his Agatha Christie trilogy for Disney, in which he reprises his role of Hercule Poirot opposite Tina Fey, Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Dornan. Later this year, he returns to the stage to direct and lead\u00a0King Lear, which will debut at the Wyndham Theater in London before transferring to the Shed in NY in 2024. In 2021, Branagh won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for\u00a0Belfast, which also received an additional six nominations including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nAs for Goldstein and Daley, the duo is coming off their action-adventure comedy\u00a0Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\u00a0starring Chris Pine. The film premiered at SXSW festival has become one of best-reviewed tentpoles of the year, with a 90% grade on Rotten Tomatoes. Their writing and directing credits also include\u00a0Game Night\u00a0as well as writing\u00a0Horrible Bosses, its sequel and\u00a0Spider-Man: Homecoming.\n\nGoldstein and Daley are represented by CAA, Fourth Wall Management and Hansen Jacobson Teller. Reynolds is repped by WME and Sloane Offer Weber &amp; Dern. Branagh is represented by WME, Berwick &amp; Kovacik and Gochman Law Group.",

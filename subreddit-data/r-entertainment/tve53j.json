In other words he doesn\u2019t process social cues and body language. Like if someone so out of touch with expressing their anger properly, comes up to assault you with a smile on their face. For sure Gervais would\u2019ve ran away giggling, and he also would\u2019ve gone for the jugular with an infidelity joke that couldn\u2019t have been passed off as defending the honor of ones toxic wife. \n\nAlso, Rock was bullied physically and sexually all of his school years. I think \u2018trauma\u2019 gets overused a bit. But if Smith assaulting Rock didn\u2019t literally smack a 57yo man back into childhood trauma, as well as those watching, with that theatrical attempt at reclaiming ones masculinity, I don\u2019t know what is. Rock pulled his punches, twice, and the thanks he gets is a \u201cWild West\u201d thespian slap and movies stars rushing to Smiths \u201caid\u201d after, while Rock goes on with the show alone. Bless Wanda Sykes, I love the way comedians get each other\u2019s backs.\n\nI find the approval of violence towards a comedian from social conservatives that believe in protecting a woman\u2019s honor and social liberals that think comedians go too far is both wrong. I know comedies under fire these days but what\u2019s not being discussed is Satire and the importance of it. It dates back to Kings and Queens and the Jester being the only one allowed to mock the king on our behalf and live. Hollywood is American royalty. Satire used to be sacred for keeping elites in check and missing that point is for ones limited political lens is really bugging me. It\u2019s classist.\n\nIt was like watching the captain of the football team and prom king assault the class nerd on prom night while his mean girl girlfriend watched, cackling. \n\nHe handled it beyond well. But some of the intersectional takes and canceling of Smith critics has been quietly appalling. A rich famous man committed violence on national tv and got away with it. Full stop.",

I also noticed Rock did something unusual which is that when Smith got up and walked towards the stage Rock put his hands behind his back instead of putting his hands in a defensive position which most men would do to prepare for a fight. He also leaned towards Smith as Smith approached him which is why there are some ridiculous conspiracy theories that it was staged since most people wouldn't lean towards someone angry at them. But I think you're right. I don't think Rock understood the danger of the behavior so he put his hands behind his back and leaned towards Smith instead of preparing himself for an assault.",

Farrah's hair style from that time period was iconic and a lot of women tried to copy it for themselves with varying degrees of success. I think that it was a pretty high maintenance look to pull off. Anyhow, this person said that Farrah's hair look kind of dried out and 'fried' from all the blow drying, hot curling irons and 'frosting' to enhance that blonde look. She said that when you looked at Farrah from behind and the wind blew her hair a certain way, that there was a sizable 'bald' spot in the 'crown' area of her head.",

In essence, he made a veiled 2nd joke that only a few would understand.  That's why Will laughs at the GI Jane bit, and then gets serious after the 2nd sentence.",

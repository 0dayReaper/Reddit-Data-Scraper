I\u2019m always triggered by people who catch STDs w/o sexual transmission because of a news brief I saw very young.\n\nI\u2019ll go into full detail since y\u2019all are asking. &gt;!When I was about 8 years old, I lived in Bremerton, Washington, which is/was kind of like a town for military families. Anyway, there was a local Burger King where a guy was working. He had an incurable STI (it was Hepatitis, it was *not* HIV/AIDS) and used his DNA (not just blood, but various fluids and his stool as well) to put into people\u2019s food and condiments, and this went on for weeks. Of course people (a lot of kids in particular) started getting sick and most obviously were infected. When they did an investigation, they went through all the camera footage and basically everything was right there. I remember watching it on the news because my parents were flipping out about the story. For two reasons \u2014 they would take us (my sister and I) to that particular Burger King on occasion, and they wanted to make sure none of us were infected (we weren\u2019t). They arrested the guy and I don\u2019t know what happened to him. There was a class action lawsuit if you\u2019d ever eaten there during the guy\u2019s employment. Don\u2019t know where that went and I never asked my parents if we were apart of it. The Burger King was closed and to my understanding it was never reopened and who knows what\u2019s there now. It was so traumatizing as a child. I basically just stopped eating at restaurants for most of my young adult life until years later. The wife of the guy was all over the news too but this happened so long ago that I forgot if she was aware or not. I hope that fucker is still in prison, but something tells me after 26 years he\u2019s not. And tbh he ruined my childhood of just enjoying getting the little toys in the kids meals, which were my favorite part. So whenever someone talks about getting an STD/STI that is not from sexual transmission, I immediately think of this incident. You could be completely innocent, you could be a kid, and some psycho can give it to you intentionally through the means of food or drink. I know now with an adult education that things like HIV don\u2019t spread as easily through food and drink, but because he had Hep, it was a different story.!&lt;",

I saw an employee making my milkshake and she was pumping the flavor syrup into a cup. She had a hard time pumping so she got a short plastic fork and started scooping the syrup by hand. She wasn\u2019t using gloves and I was a bit uncomfortable with that but as long as her hand didn\u2019t make actual contact with the syrup I figured it wasn\u2019t the worst.  \n\nBut then, she spilled some syrup on the outside of the vat and instead of just cleaning it up afterwards, she scraped it off and put it in the drink. So unsanitary!",

On the other hand if you\u2019re comfortable with coding in Java even if you don\u2019t remember much and you\u2019re taking two other easy courses, you\u2019ll probably be fine.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a nice, not too aggressive introduction to college in your first term, do NOT take it.",

I\u2019ve had friends who started off with CS 10 and got destroyed by both the workload and the lack of being accustomed to finish labs in such a short time span as opposed to those who started off with CS 1 and had an easier transition. Would definitely recommend CS 1 first!! You\u2019ve got plenty of time to take CS 10 later.",

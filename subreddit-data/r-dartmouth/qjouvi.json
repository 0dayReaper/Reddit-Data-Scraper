Kinda worried about quarter grades report cos I\u2019m sure my school (live outside of US) doesn\u2019t offer that kind of transcript while there\u2019s no one except me is applying to US colleges so neither school officials nor counselor would give a shit bout that. My counselor would probably just upload my current transcript again. Does quarter grades matter a lot? or you only need to send that if u get accepted",

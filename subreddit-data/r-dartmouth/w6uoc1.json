Would that be a dual major, or a custom major, or is it simply not possible?\n\nWould appreciate the help.",

            "comment": "The easiest way to combine majors is to do a modified major where you take a mix of classes. You could also dual major or do a major/minor. Doing a \"special major\", as Dartmouth calls it, is pretty tough since you need to show that there is no other way to accomplish the intended course of study.",

Of course there are people who love to drink, but definitely not expected by any means to fully participate in the Dartmouth experience.\n\nFor me, Dartmouth was a great college experience.  I am still in active touch with many of my Dartmouth friends and we consider each other family and help each other both professionally and personally.  The environment was very collaborative for me in my major, and I had tons of options for academic learning opportunities - both on campus and off-campus.\n\nTo get a feeling for Dartmouth's academic and special environment, watch Tom Cormen's last lecture.  He is a world class professor who loves teaching undergraduates.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uQRrNdpMsU",

    "postText": "Hello, I will be applying RD this January and I was wondering whether it is okay to practice bass guitar/electric guitar in dorm rooms during the day. If accepted, I wouldn't want to be a disturbance to my dorm neighbours. I did take a look at the page on practice rooms but they seem to just be for piano/percussion. \n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for the helpful responses! ",

Also, there are practice rooms and people have gone with other instruments (they are moving w/ the renovation of the Hop, but you can always find somewhere!)",

As long as you keep it quiet and aren\u2019t playing into the wee hours of the night, people are normally fine with it. Just don\u2019t be annoying about it.",

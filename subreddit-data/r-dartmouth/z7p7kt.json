We want to ensure when candidates are selected for admission, we will have sufficient information on file to make a financial aid decision.   \n\nWe are not able to determine your financial aid eligibility for the 2023/2024 academic year because your application is currently incomplete.  If you have recently supplied the requested information, please allow at least one week for this information to be processed. You may check online at any time to see the status of your application.\u201d",

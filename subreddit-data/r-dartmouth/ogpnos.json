We work for our A's, but grading is pretty fair across the board. I'm not really sure where you heard we have inflation because we're notorious for *not* having it.\n\nBut if you want an easy time in college, Dartmouth probably isn't for you. Don't pick your school based on whether the premed is easy. Medicine is hard, so you may as well start building the work ethic and study habits early",

It sounds like you might value exploring a few premed courses to decide if its right for you. I initially wanted to major in econ, but graduated as a premed doing bio and music haha\n\n By the way, the average matriculant from Dartmouth into medical school has a GPA around 3.6, which is lower than the national average. I would argue it is easier to be premed at Dartmouth in some ways because you don't have to compete for research or shadowing opportunities compared to students at a large public university and also it is easier to develop connections with professors who can write a stronger rec letters for you.",

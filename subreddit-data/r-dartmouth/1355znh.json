    "postText": "If I take AP Stats exam and get a 4+ and get credit for MATH 10 (Introduction to Stats), how exactly does this help me because It looks like I'd still have to take ECON10 (or would I have to take both MATH 10 and ECON10) if I pursue Econ. Any clarification about this stuff would be helpful i'm confused. I'm also interested in Physics and maybe Comp sci so what would Math 10 help with there?",

            "comment": "hi there! If you earn a 4+ on the AP Stats exam you will earn credit for math 10. This credit will satisfy econ 10, and you won't have to take econ 10. I recommend not taking econ 10 or math 10 if you have ap stats credit. The material is basically the same and could be a drag.",

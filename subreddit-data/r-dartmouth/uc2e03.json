            "comment": "The 4 quarters a year include summer, so almost everyone takes freshman and junior summer off. Because of sophomore summer, you also wind up taking one \"normal\" academic year term off during sophomore or junior year.\n\nThe terms run roughly:\n\n* Fall - Early September - Thanksgiving\n* Winter - New Years - Mid-March\n* Spring - Late March - Early June\n* Summer - Late June - Late August",

    "postText": "Got into Dartmouth, I\u2019m over the god-damn moon. However, I have one question.\n\nAre there moose close to campus?\n\nAll I want is to see those funny looking mfs. Have you ever seen a moose? They\u2019ve got those stupid looking big black eyes that pop out of their head like gum balls. They\u2019re so weirdly jacked but have little spindly legs like the Lord was playing Jenga or something. THEY MOOO LIKE FUCKING COWS (this one I\u2019m just guessing on).\n\nSo, any current Dartmouth students\u2014do you see moose close to campus? How far from campus do you have to go to see a moose? If you are/know a moose, please go back to frolicking around like an idiot.",

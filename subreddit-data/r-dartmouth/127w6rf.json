I know ivy day was yesterday (congrats to everyone who got in!!), so now that the majority of \u201827s are admitted, i just want to know what you guys did to help you be accepted? I know that\u2019s such a vague question, but if some people would be willing to share their basic stats, major EC\u2019s, and/or their essay topics, that would be awesome. Again congrats to everyone who got in!!!!",

I think the absolute biggest thing for Dartmouth is the essay, bc everyone is gonna have a good GPA (above 3.7 probably) and a good test score (above 33/1480 probably). When I talked to my area's admissions counselor, he said that the essays are the first thing they read. Really think hard about what makes you different from all the other special applicants, because you don't need to shock the counselors, you just need to set yourself apart. it really is a crapshoot though",

I was admitted regular decision several years before the pandemic and got in with a strong academic record and application, but my 1430 SAT was 65 points below that year\u2019s median. I did do really well on now-defunct SAT Subject tests and my essay topic was solid, but I don\u2019t think I would have made the regular decision cut today. Dartmouth now has a financial aid calculator on their website, so you can see how much the school will cost you and your family based on family assets and income. Early decision won\u2019t bump a somewhat underqualified applicant over the top and factors like whether two folks from the same high school are EDing can still come into play, but it can be a helpful process for a really solid applicant to let Dartmouth know that they are their first choice.",

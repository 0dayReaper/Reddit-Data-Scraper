    "postText": "Hello! Incoming international freshman. Two questions about gym/nutrition at Dartmouth.\n\n1) How to weave through dining menu to get enough protein in while keeping calories low? Like what items in dining halls should I keep a lookout for? \n\n2) How is the gym community at Dartmouth?   \nFor example, in my hometown I can go up to basically any experienced lifter and ask them to check my form/ask questions and they have all been pretty nice.",

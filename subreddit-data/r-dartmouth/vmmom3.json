    "postText": "Hello! '26 here. How does one make the best use of the d plan to find internship opportunities? I'm majoring in CS, so I would assume the most impressive internships would be at google or microsoft or something similar. \n\nDoes the d plan actually help finding an internship at these big companies? Do I just apply on their website as per normal and specify that I'm looking to take the internship in, for example, sophomore winter? In the example of sophomore winter, would I send in the application at the beginning of fall term? If anyone has experience hunting for cs (or just generally) internships with the d plan, please share!",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019ll be applying to colleges this fall as a math/physics major, and I\u2019ve been reading a lot about Dartmouth lately. From what I\u2019ve read (the outdoorsy vibe, strong school spirit and traditions, small student population/close knit community between the students and professors), Dartmouth seems really great.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve also heard some people say how Dartmouth has this certain type of culture (like lots of partying, exclusive friend groups, rampant SA, rich+ white culture, etc), and I was wondering how true that really is? \n\nI don\u2019t mind lots of partying and I\u2019m not bothered by other people drinking, but the rest of the stuff about students being super exclusive and everything kinda concerns me.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not really planning on joining a sorority but I heard that Greek life is super big there? \n\nFor context, I\u2019m pretty introverted and moderately nerdy (but I still love hiking and the outdoors and all that), so I was wondering if Dartmouth\u2019s culture would be too different for me. \n\nAlso, is it true that Dartmouth has a \u201cpre professional\u201d vibe? I definitely didn\u2019t like the pre professional vibe I got from Georgetown \n\nAny insight would be really appreciated!",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll try to answer most of your questions HAHA\n\nDartmouth definitely is a work hard play hard kind of school and there definitely are people that choose to go out and party multiple times a week. But you don\u2019t have to do that and there are people who don\u2019t enjoy partying and do other activities on campus, which if you are not interested in Greek Life, I have found that those people tend to gravitate towards one another anyway. But also even in Greek Life, I know a couple of people in each house who just are there for the good vibes and don\u2019t drink or party much at all. If you don\u2019t want to do greek life, the DOC is pretty big and a great social scene that people describe as an alternative \n\nI honestly think because of our size, I don\u2019t see Dartmouth as being cliquey? which some might say is contradictory but I think being a small school means that it\u2019s a lot easier to bump into people frequently and meet a lot of random people that way. Less of a feeling that I\u2019m just lost in the sea of students. Are groups going to end up forming though? Yeah, but that\u2019s likely true for most schools anyway. I actually think we\u2019re one of the least exclusive ivys because we don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously. compared to how my other friends at similar institutions describe their experiences, it\u2019s a lot easier to join clubs and meet people here at dartmouth who are not trying to perpetuate an elitist mindset aka making friends based on how rich or well-connected you are\n\nAs for SA, yes that\u2019s an issue. I don\u2019t want to sound dismissive, but this is something that you will find at all campuses across the US. I honestly do think Dartmouth and most students see it as a genuine concern and treat allegations seriously. there are also resources to help you through it if ever you or a friend experiences SA and there are ways to keep yourself safe. As someone who\u2019s part of a greek house, there\u2019s also a big feeling of \u201cwe have to look out for each other\u201d.\n\nAs a POC, I think being in a predominantly white institution can definitely be tough at times, but afaik the incoming classes have a combined percentage of POC &gt; white students on campus.\nYou can also definitely surround yourself with other POC. \n\nAs for you being introverted and nerdy, so am I! and so are a bunch of people here. There are lots of people on campus who fall perfectly in that category and I\u2019m pretty sure you will find people you click with. Just remember to take the initiative to find those people because no matter where you go it won\u2019t be immediate or easy. Join clubs, go to events, grab a meal w people, etc. \n\nLastly, is Dartmouth pre-professional? Nope, not \nunless you surround yourself with people who are very excited about that stuff",

Everyone has their own friend groups, including non-\u201cbro\u201d types who never set foot inside a party. Ignore what you\u2019ve read. \u201cBro culture\u201d is definitely NOT rampant enough to worry about. It\u2019s barely noticeable unless you\u2019re always going to fraternity parties. 90% of those bro types are pretty nice though. Don\u2019t think it means douche, like it might\u2019ve in HS.\n\n2. Dartmouth is what, 50% non-white? Literally looks like any other diverse Northeast school.\n\n3. The rest of what you\u2019ve read is true. The good stuff.",

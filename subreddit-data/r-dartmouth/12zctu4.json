It\u2019s less than a 15 min drive\n\nIf I\u2019m not mistaken, the owner also did PE-credit BJJ courses for Dartmouth pre-pandemic. I liked him. Class was small, mostly grappling, only learned a few moves. Probably way different if you pay to learn at his gym. \n\nHe did classes in a room at Alumni gym. It\u2019s the only one I know of that has mats. Tae Kwon Do practices there as well I think. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s open for general use though\n\nNot sure if they\u2019re doing that PE class again, but it\u2019s worth looking into",

No other school in the Upper Valley teaches real sword-fighting techniques based on historical treatises.\"\n\n[Site link](https://www.noblescience.org/newhampshire)",

    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm a '27 about to graduate HS and I'm already getting pretty anxious about college- that I won't fit in, or that it'll be too competitive for me to succeed, etc. I know I'm worthy of my acceptance, will have fun once I get there, and am well-prepared for college, but unfortunately, that doesn't quell my fears.\n\nI get especially nervous thinking about all those crazy people that get in, like those paying $100k+ in private HS tuition??!! And the people who already have tons of experience in exactly what they want to pursue for college. \n\nFor context, I'm an average, sociable, first-gen American from a decent high school that hasn't cured cancer but is successful for my school.\n\nI'd love to get any advice, personal stories, or anything else to help me feel better! Thank you so much!",

Imposter syndrome for daaaays.  \nYou will share classes with insanely bright, articulate, unique, and interesting people.  Some will be \u201csavagely brilliant\u201d, as I would call them.\n\nI was petrified that I was in over my head, unprepared, didn\u2019t come from a rigorous prep school, doomed to slog behind scores of my peers. \n\nAnd then, one day, in a religion class (Martyrdom in the Western World), one of these people I venerated stopped me and said I made them think in a new way. \n\nWe are all iron.  And we sharpen each other.  You will bring something to the table that makes someone else\u2019s experience better.  You got this.  Welcome to the fold.",

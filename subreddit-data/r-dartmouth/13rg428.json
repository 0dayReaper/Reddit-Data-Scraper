    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI am a rising '27 who is considering majoring in Government or Econ or some combination of the two. Going to law school has always been my end goal.\n\nI wanted to know if anyone had any insight on how Dartmouth students fare in the law school admissions process. Does the college offer any resources such as advising/LSAT prep, etc. ? This might be a stupid question but do students from the college \"feed\" into any top law schools?\n\nI'll take any information and insight that I can get!\n\nThanks for reading",

Heads up for law school, both Government and Econ have enforced B+ medians so you really have to push to get A's in most Gov and Econ classes. Law schools really value having a top GPA (along with an LSAT) more than your major choice. I'm a gov major who's planning on going to law school and many fellow Gov majors think it's an unwise major choice for law school. It's unfortunate because it's the most relevant major to the study of law. One approach you can consider is pursuing a major with a higher median and taking the Gov classes related to the law. Still, I've heard that Dartmouth students generally fare very well in law school admissions but it's not yet a process I've undertaken. \n\nFinally, I would highly recommend Bedi's civil liberties course, and Duthu's Federal Indian Law course once you are able to handle their reading and work load. \n\nHope this helps!",

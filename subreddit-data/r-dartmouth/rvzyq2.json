    "postText": "International admit here and was wondering how much money can I make working? I'd really appreciate if you can be as specific as possible. What type of jobs pay the most? How hard is it to secure a job? How much can I expect to earn over summer?\nAlso, I was wondering about living expenses. How accurate is the 22k per year living expenses in the official CoA and how much can I expect out-of-pocket personal expenses? Is it possible to reduce my living costs below the one in the cost of attendance, for example through alternative cheaper housing?",

            "comment": "Heyyy! International student here! If you work a cafe service job, you make $15 dollars an hour. Many international students work at Ramekin, and many other students work at Novack. Novack is a stressful job; $15 an hour looks good, but it is work. Make no mistake. And you have three classes you\u2019re taking. \n\nIf you work the $15 per hour jobs for about 10-12 hours a week (I do not recommend working for more than that), you should earn $150-$180 dollars a week. That\u2019s $600 a month. Let\u2019s say you need to spend $200 on stuff and $100 on taxes. That\u2019s about $300 left behind (depending on how you spend). \n\nYou could make $750+ dollars in a term (10 weeks) depending on how you spend and save. That\u2019s around $2,250 per year. This might sound rosy, but trust me, service jobs are a bit of work. \n\nSecuring jobs is easy. Dining and service jobs pay the best, and they are easy to secure. \n\nAnother job that pays well is the Thayer Machine Shop assistantship. $15 an hour. Or being a tutor for the Academic Skills Center. However, you can only be a tutor from the winter term, and it can be tough to get it. \n\nYou can work at the Machine Shop from the fall term if you start early. \n\nYou can match if you want to discuss. \n\n22k per year as living expenses sounds high. What amount of financial aid do you receive? Are you living on campus? (On-campus housing is generally cheaper than off-campus).",

I got a full tuition scholarship. I'm a bit confused over their breakdown because the Cost breakdown on their website gives a similar value for total loving expenses but the breakdown has different sections like personal and miscellaneous expenses. This is a bit confusing. Are my living costs likely to be restricted to this 22k amount or should I have to budget for out of pocket expenses? Also is health insurance separate?\nI'd also love to know how much can I make over the summer?",

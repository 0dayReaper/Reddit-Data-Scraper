But I don't see why you couldn't join the Lebanon Outing Club and jump at [Storrs Hill](https://skistorrshill.com) when the jumps (K25 and K50) are open, which has usually been Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Another alternative is [Ford Sayre Ski Club](https://www.fordsayre.org/jumping/) which maintains a K32 jump on Dartmouth property at Oak Hill on Mondays and Wednesdays. Both clubs typically work with younger kids but I can't imagine they would turn a Dartmouth student away who just wanted to get some reps in.",

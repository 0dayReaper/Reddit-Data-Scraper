Then, once people let their guards down, he rapes them.\n\nAccording to one particularly egregious allegation, he just went into someone's room and raped them.",

Also he looks like Mike Damone from fast times at Ridgemont high, who is also a super creepy person with a pathological desire to project a certain image.  The \"activist\" is just tweeting shit like who else wants slay queen jen psaki to host meet the press instead of chuck todd? multiple times in an hour.  People would rather watch a glacier melt  than watch chuck todd host anything, but he is a little clever with because you want journalist, the ones who are supposed to hold people in power accountable and challenge them, to be the presidents last press secretary, no conflicts of interest there.  I believe that is rung 3 of 5 in in the propaganda model.  Hope for the safety of everyone up there he has been booted off campus.",

I watched the email list for deals for those on fin aid and jumped on coupons for stuff (like for Dartmouth Coach). Freshman year I spent maybe $20 at the sustainability fair (getting stuff for my dorm), then $100 or so on a trip to NYC with friends, then another $20 on this and that. Much of my trips were with clubs so were covered. I am pretty sure I got discounts on memberships (like for climbing club but I am not 100% sure).",

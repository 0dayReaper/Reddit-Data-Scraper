There are DOC winter trips (like canoeing in the everglades or climbing in Arizona and on and on). They are super popular (more demand than space). If you want to do one, apply to every trip that you are remotely interested in. I applied only to my favorite one and that was a bad strategy. Of course, if you are not into that kind of stuff, then this doesn't apply. In that case, ask upperclassmen what they do for winter break to get ideas. I ended up hanging at home. I had great plans to set up a month-long internship or do some kind of adventure but just ended up watching a lot of videos. Also I'll say that as a freshman, 6-week winter break felt like forever. As an upperclassman, 6-week feels short. I have so much I want to cram into those weeks.",

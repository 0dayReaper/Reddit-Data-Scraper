What is the best way to get to and from campus? What route do you guys take? \n4. What is some clothing brands I should look into in preparing myself for the weather? Thanks!",

            "comment": "1) The good ones are very good, the bad ones are pretty rough, and most of them are decent. Much better than many other schools I have visited. \n\n2) I haven't eaten on campus in a bit, but there is a decent bit of variety for options.\n\n3) You'll want to fly to Boston and take the Dartmouth Coach straight to campus.\n\n4) You don't need to get a $900 Canada Goose or anything dumb like that. There are plenty of solid 200-400 coats out there. You also will want to layer using some mid-layers. Outside can be very cold, while buildings can be very warm, so you want some ability to tweak your outfit's warmth as you move around campus.",

            "comment": "1. Dorms for freshies are poor. After freshie year, you get moved into non-freshie dorms, which can also vary in quality. Fahey (West House)+ McLaughlin cluster (North Park) are the best, but its randomly assigned. Assignment into these groups such as West House, North Park, etc. is random and you can\u2019t switch between them. \n2. Food is honestly not amazing. People like FOCO (main dining hall), but its really bland and sometimes shitty. The desserts are fucking amazing tho. In terms of the other dinings halls, those are much better. The HOP is just greasy food, so its bound to be good. \n3. Fly to Boston Logan and then take dartmouth coach. Book a 2 way coach ticket as they are cheaper and tickets never expire. AKA you can book any day and use them on any day. \n4. Get winter boots and a warm coat. Otherwise, normal Midwest clothing is fine.",

            "comment": "Hey! Good luck!! \n\n1- Eh, they\u2019re alright. I\u2019m in West House, in the \u201cRiver Dorms\u201d which are considered to be some of the worst. They are OK, but a long walk, communal bathrooms, small common room, old facilities, etc. but, I\u2019m in a two room double, which means my roommate and I both get our own space. And, my dorm comes with a microwave and mini fridge. The Choates are not very good, but a little closer. Ultimately none of the freshmen dorms are all that great unless you\u2019re in North Park. The upper class dorms seem a lot nicer, though. Overall not too bad. \n\n2-I don\u2019t mind the food. I think it\u2019s pretty good, with a decent variety, especially compared to other schools. The dining plan is a little convoluted, but you won\u2019t go hungry. I think the food is pretty good, but I can see how upperclassmen would get sick of it. \n\n3- I\u2019m from the Midwest, so I fly to Boston, and take the Dartmouth coach from the airport to campus\u2014overall pretty easy! \n\n4- I can\u2019t speak definitely to this yet, because next term will be my first winter up there, but get a good coat, and wear lots of layers. I\u2019ve also been wearing the duck boots the other commenter mentioned and they\u2019re pretty solid! They\u2019ve been good for rain and snow, are comfortable, and hold up well. Very popular among students. \n\nGood luck again! I\u2019ve only had one term at Dartmouth so far but I absolutely love it. You\u2019ve made a good choice in applying.",

            "comment": "1. Tbh I've seen almost all the dorm options for freshmen and they aren't as bad as it seems (mostly just location - all are tolerable). Mine was actually really nice and so there is a range.\n2. The food is pretty good - there are a lot of options to choose from, but it can be a bit repetitive depending on your preferences. (ex. Novack - pre-made sandwiches, packaged sushi, starbucks, muffins/pastries, snacks. FOCO - main dining hall, lots of options for actual meals. Collis - smoothies, made-to-go options. Hop - burgers, fries, chicken tenders, soup, salads. Then other random little cafes around campus)\n3. Most people fly, but some drive .. If you want to drive, look on google maps but highways/more traveled roads are definitely better than going a more rural route (winding roads, etc).\n4. While some opt for luxury winter brands, you would be fine with patagonia, ll bean, etc... just get a warm winter coat, gloves, hat, winter boots and then also some rain boats for in the spring when snow melts!",

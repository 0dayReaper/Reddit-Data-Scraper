Just focus on writing your own and getting feedback. That way it\u2019s authentic. The admissions committee can tell if you\u2019re being authentic or if you\u2019re trying to impress them. Be the former",

Seeing an example essay may help guide you, but your essay has to be you at the end of the day. (I\u2019m sure my essay is far worse than the amazing ones you see online, but still happy to share)",

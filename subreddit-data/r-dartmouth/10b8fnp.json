    "postText": "Build the Pattern aims to create a personalized and engaging way to address binge eating habits on college campuses. It taps into the psychology of habit making, dialectical behavioral therapy, and coping skills to bring to life a new solution to the problem. My name is Pari Goel and I am a junior at Duke University studying Psychology at Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Duke University. Through the Early Founder Innovation Program, I am trying to bring \u201cBuild the Pattern\u201d to life. I have been involved in various mental health initiatives throughout my time as an undergraduate career. I have been a research assistant at the Duke University Eating Disorder Lab and currently co-lead the chapter of Body Banter. I also have my own podcast where I try to understand disordered eating on college campuses and amplify these voices. \n\nIn order to develop the features of this app, I want to conduct focus conversations to understand college student experiences. If you are willing to have a 15-20 minute conversation, please fill out this google form below. I will contact you directly to set up a time to talk via phone.  The call will be anonymous and will help inform the app features. Below are the questions I will ask: \n\n* Could you provide me context on your experience with binge eating? \n* Could you walk me through your most recent binge eating episode on campus? \n* What have you tried/currently do to address binge eating? \n* What usually triggers your binge eating? \n* What do you typically do after you binge eat? \n\nIf you struggle with binge eating and restriction and are a college student please consider filling out this form: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc3C\\_UXDQdJ77jcsDVZTsdOKeNooSb658lpiFuvBk5Q8S-3TA/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc3C_UXDQdJ77jcsDVZTsdOKeNooSb658lpiFuvBk5Q8S-3TA/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\nMore information: [https://www.buildthepattern.com/](https://www.buildthepattern.com/) \n\nFor more information, feel free to reach out to me directly: \n\nPari Goel \n\n[paridhi.goel@duke.edu](mailto:paridhi.goel@duke.edu)",

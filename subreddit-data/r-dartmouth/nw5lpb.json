    "postText": "'25 here. So, I applied for housing accommodation because I suffer from a mental disorder. I had my school psychologist complete my application and applied some days ago.\n\nI was wondering if this could negatively affect my admission. For example, could I get rescinded?\n\nI know it sounds stupid, and this probably won't be the case. However, I made it really obvious that I have moderate mental issues, and I know that's what accommodation is for, but I just want someone else to reassure me that I'll be fine.\n\nOn a side note, my personal statement was about how I've been coping with this very same mental disorder.",

If they didn't want to accept you because of the mental disorder, they wouldn't have. \n\nAlso, pretty sure that the info your psychologist has given the housing people can't be spread outside of the housing people. Basically, once you're admitted, they're probably not gonna go back on that. I know two people who had to take medical leave for mental health issues, and they were both able to re-enroll no problem, so the school doesn't have a precedent of kicking people out for mental illnesses.\n\nWelcome to Dartmouth! We're excited to have ya.",

            "comment": "Nope! No chance they revoke your admission. For one, housing accommodations are privately. Not to mention, even if they weren't, admissions and academic departments have very little contact with residential life. It's easy to see Dartmouth as one entity, but the separate departments are pretty independent.\n\nI asked for accommodations for a moderate mental thing, but I was very worried it would put a target on my back. Later learned that literally like. Three would ever even know I have housing accommodations, and less than that would even know why. \n\nResidential life is going to try to house you appropriately, and they don't actually give a fuck about everything else",

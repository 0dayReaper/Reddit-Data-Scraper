They had this to say abt the mug:\n\n\n&gt; Regarding the mug: we had hoped to be able to send a gift to every enrolling student in June.  Unfortunately, we\u2019ve run into significant issues with mailing items to locations outside of the U.S.  As a result, we have decided to hold onto your gift so that we can give it to you when you come to campus in the fall.  Please keep your eye out for an email from our office explaining how to pick up your gift when you come to Dartmouth. We look forward to meeting you in-person!\n\nIf you\u2019re international, don\u2019t worry\u2014your mug is in safe hands. If you\u2019re a domestic student, keep waiting I guess.",

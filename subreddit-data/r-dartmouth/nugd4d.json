Mediocre food (like most of what's in FOCO, the cafeteria) is quicker usually but also just... not worth the money. My biggest gripe with Dartmouth Dining is how expensive it is. \n\nIn my experience, every Starbucks on campus, like Novak, is horrible. I guess they don't teach them how to make the drinks in the normal Starbucks way?? \n\nThe food was not a factor for me in whether to come to Dartmouth, and it definitely is not BAD -- you won't be starving like at some colleges. It's just overpriced normal food.",

Foco can be really good on special occasions but after 4 years of it you might grow a little tired of it. Currently the Hop is closed ever since covid. \n\nI would give it a 7/10 for its price relative to some public college cafeterias I've been in personally",

    "postText": "I'm a prospective international student looking forward to ed1 to Dartmouth. I really love the college and it's warm community. However, I feel like the admission officer might see me not fitting in into the community. One of the reasons I'm applying to Dartmouth is the emphasis it has on outdoor clubs. It's not something that I can do here in my country, and looking on the profile of most accepted students, they all seem to be athletes or whatsoever.  \nHow hard is it to fit into such community if you r just like me (a stem/philosophy/music nerd) with 0 experience in athletics or whatsoever?",

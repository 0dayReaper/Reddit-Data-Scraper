That sounds like a cool plan but one thing to keep in mind with dartmouth is you have distributive requirements (~9 classes) so that\u2019s quite a lot of things. I only know of about 2-3 people (I\u2019m a senior) who have successfully completed a double major + minor",

You just have to take some courses that are 'concentrated' in CWRT as part of your English major course selection.\n\n\\- Also, consider the modified major options or even the special 'create your own major' option as 2 majors + another minor is like 26 courses of the 35 or so you'll take not including 9 distribs. It's doable but leaves you with less flexibility with scheduling as not all the courses are offered every term or sometimes every year.\n\n[https://admissions.dartmouth.edu/academics/custom-majors](https://admissions.dartmouth.edu/academics/custom-majors)",

I double majored, and I found that I couldn't take many fun/educational courses outside of my field that would have made me a more well-rounded student. You can try and plan very carefully, but you will have to sacrifice taking classes that might interest you because of schedules.",

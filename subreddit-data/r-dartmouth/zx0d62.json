    "postText": "Hello, I'm an international applicant from AFRICAAA.\nI want to submit my app to Dartmouth without SAT scores. I never intended to write SAT exam but I got a last minute support from a relative who heard I was considering applying to the US. I only had one month to exam date (I was writing A-Levels Exams when I got registered) to study coupled with my mum falling really I'll, I was pretty much not 100% on studies as I had a lot on my plate.\nI'm super happy with my score though because I have been out of school for 2+ years and still managed to get a EBRW: 630 MATH: 700 (I was expecting WORRRSSEEE)\n\nAnyone here who applied to Dartmouth test-optional? Is it possible to get in Optional as an international student or are my chances completely flunked?",

    "postText": "\\^  I'm pretty much applying to all my colleges as a Data Science major. But Dartmouth perplexed me with \"Mathematical Data Science.\" I've been doing research on it online and information is quite scarce. Is it the Data Science I'm thinking of with Statistics, Computer Science, and Business? Or is it completely math-based?",

I\u2019ve been writing my supplementals and have been writing about doing a dual degree in mathematical data science and computer science. But with your suggestion, it seems like QSS covers both grounds. I feel like QSS is more digestible for application officers than a dual degree? Any thoughts?",

It depends what part of Comp Sci are you actually interested in because QSS definitely misses a lot of the more complex parts of software engineering. I'd say you just put all of that into the 3 fields that interest you in the application, and then maybe you can just write about QSS in the essay because it's a 100 words anyway and not like there's a lot of room to even talk about your major (you also wanna mention the community part etc)",

You're applying to the college. It's fine on an essay to say that you're interested in something, but declaring a major happens as a sophomore. You could go for, say, art history once you're in.",

But i wanted to make sure i knew what i was saying in the supplement. i almost didnt realize that Mathematical Data Science is pretty much just Statistics and I was writing about general Data Science. But luckily another commenter mentioned QSS and it worked perfectly on the essay",

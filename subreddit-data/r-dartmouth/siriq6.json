    "postText": "Hey all,   \nI am a 22 y/o guy from California and I am about to accept a job offer from a finance firm right near Campus. Coming straight out of my undergrad, I am hoping find a roommate in grad school or late undergrad.   \n\n\nOverall I am pretty chill, and I don't smoke or anything annoying like that. Pretty timely with chores, and the only thing that is likely to annoy you is my rowing machine (but you would be able to use it too :D)  \n\n\nI'm hoping to keep the rent pretty cheap if possible and looking at Hanover (ideal), Lebanon, or West Lebanon.\n\nPM me if you are interested or know anyone and we can chat more.",

In general you'll see a very steep gradient in housing cost/value as you move away from campus. Things walking distance to campus are expensive, rundown, or both. But if you move to like a 5-10m drive away it's a whole different story.",

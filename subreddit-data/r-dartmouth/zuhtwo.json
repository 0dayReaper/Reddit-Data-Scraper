It was a magazine/brochure from Dartmouth with very clear purpose of promotion and advertising. It was super strange for me because I live in Switzerland and it was just confusing if they have sent this mail to me totally randomly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you think this is because Dartmouth was interested in me?",

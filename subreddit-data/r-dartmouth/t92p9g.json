However, it doesn\u2019t even rank in top 90 by US News in economics. Is there a specific reason for this, or is Dartmouth\u2019s economics program not very good?",

I took the intro class because I wanted to understand economics, and that's probably the only Econ class I will ever take.\n\nBy looking at the US news rankings for economics, you're making a fatal flaw here by being too attached to rankings luster.  The US News rankings for the social sciences cover graduate programs, and many departments (including Econ) at Dartmouth do not even offer graduate programs... Dartmouth is an undergraduate-focused institution.  And any employer worth their salt in the U.S is gonna know that.\n\nDartmouth does badly when it comes these rankings also because it's a small college, and there are less professors there than at other schools, and these rankings measure research output above all else.  Dartmouth cannot compete with a school like U.C Berkeley, there's just too much of a difference in size.\n\nBut if you want a school where a guy like David Blanchflower (look him up) will teach you an intro economics course without any help from TAs?  If you want a school where you can learn about finance from a guy who was the chief economic adviser for George W. Bush (I had a friend who took his class)?  You aren't getting that at U.C Berkeley.\n\nDon't focus on ratings entirely.  Look at what's unique about each college and what they will do for you.",

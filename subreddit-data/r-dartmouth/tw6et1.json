    "postText": "I love both schools for different reasons, so I am very torn. I\u2019m pretty undecided with what I want to study, but I am leaning towards something like data science or computer science, and I am also interested in global/public health. I also want to continue music performance as a non major! I like the tight knit community of Dartmouth, but I\u2019m a bit concerned about the weather and intense outdoorsy scene (I like hiking but I would not call myself an outdoorsy person). I\u2019d love any advice :)",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t consider myself particularly outdoorsy. There were certainly people more into it than me, and people less into it too. There are a lot of fun physical things to do besides hiking/mountain biking/skiing/canoeing/etc. Archery or organic farming, for example. Or even completely indoors like fencing, badminton, swimming, ice skating or swing dance. And of course non-physical things like comedy troupes, a cappella, student newspapers, debate and themed living-learning communities (LLCs). You can start your own clubs too! \n\nBut you might just find that you like one or more of those outdoorsy things, and you don\u2019t have to  do so in an over-the-top way to make friends who take those activities more seriously. Dartmouth people are pretty welcoming when it comes to their interests, and they usually have friends in multiple different majors, sports, clubs, etc. You\u2019ll grow a lot if you choose Dartmouth, and you\u2019ll have a family for life.",

From what I've heard, Dartmouth is a much more collaborative, friendly and inclusive environment. This was one of the main distinctions for me since in many academic aspects the two schools are pretty similar.",

We have already removed access to all posts and comments on Librex and will be deleting all private user data associated with Librex in the coming week. We have preserved your existing matches/DMs/chats for now, so you can connect one last time with other Librexers who you were talking to and maybe exchange information. Matches will be deleted along with all school emails and private user data in the coming week.\n\nIt's been wonderful seeing the friendships, different perspectives, and college-related information on Librex over the last two years. In particular, I have enjoyed seeing the communities that have formed and the way these communities have interacted with each other on the app.\n\nLibrex was created at a specific moment in my life and in the world at large where it was particularly needed. I will be forever grateful to the people who shared their feedback on the app, and its place in their life. In particular, I will never forget the people who told me that Librex may have saved their life by providing support during the pandemic when they felt alone and needed a friend.\n\nWith the pandemic winding down, the Librex Team and I want to focus on anew project that builds on what we learned about community from working on Librex. Our next endeavor will be much bigger than Librex, so we will not have the time and energy to properly manage Librex while working on it. While I'm excited about these next steps, it will be difficult for me to see the end of many of the amazing things that came about through Librex. I am looking forward to sharing more about what our team is working on over the coming months.\n\nSome of you might have some questions about all of this news or want to share Librex related stories. You can send all of these comments to me on my Twitter. I will share some of the ones you DM me with permission on my feed: [https://twitter.com/RyanASchiller](https://twitter.com/RyanASchiller)\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us on this journey. It's been a wild ride.\n\nRyan &amp; the Librex Team",

Many talk to the profs of classes they're taking about what research they do.. and that leads to research opportunities naturally. Profs are very open to undergrad researchers here and most will even give freshmen a chance to learn on the job. \n\nThere are also research listings and databases available to Dartmouth students to search available RA positions and also resources available through Presidential, Neukom, WISP scholars and other on-campus funded grant programs.. that will link you to profs looking for undergrad assistants.",

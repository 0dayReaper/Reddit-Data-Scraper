    "postText": "So I just got admitted to the MEng program and would like to pick the area of Computer Engineering. So according to the webpage of course requirements, I need to take  5 core courses and 4 electives to graduate in 3 quarters.\n\nHowever, I noticed that many courses in the Computer Engineering category are not available in Spring 2023 (when I will enroll). I wonder if I will have to take courses in other areas (like circuits) to fulfill the rules that international graduate students need to take at least 3 courses per quarter.",

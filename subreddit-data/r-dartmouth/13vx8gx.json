There's really no such thing as a layup class at Dartmouth, but if you're at all able to based on your D-plan, you probably shouldn't take any science classes that term. Or at the very least, no lab classes",

As leadbunny said, I think it\u2019s going to be super hard, especially if you\u2019re self-studying any of the subjects - when do you plan on taking practice tests; have you thought about what a study schedule during that time would look like? I had all my prereqs done by senior spring, so although I was taking classes, I wasn\u2019t self-studying any material. Even so, I spent probably 1-2 hours daily during the weekdays on MCAT stuff, and basically every weekend was spent with one day taking a practice FL, and the other day spent reviewing. Definitely take care in selecting your classes that term if you plan to take it during/at the end of the term!",

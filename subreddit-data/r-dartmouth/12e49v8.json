            "comment": "hey! there is definitely a strong extracurricular influence - i've certainly noticed over my time here a significant difference in how much people enjoy their time here and how involved they are with their community. the greek life is somewhat inescapable, do be warned, but you can grow to love it - dartmouth greek life truly has a place for anyone and everyone, and there is definitely more than the traditional greek life culture. greek life here is really just another opportunity to build community and establish your roots and friendships, and you can certainly pick and choose your scenes (i, for one, am not so privy to the frat basement drinking and pong culture, but for some it is the best part!). \n\nno clue about the academics of northwestern so i can't really help you there. at the end of the day, you probably won't get too much of an academic difference they're both top schools - choose what makes you feel at home. this is going to be your whole life for the next four years, make it count.",

I mean princeton is as undergrad focused as u guys yet it still ranks highly? hell even brown isnt even as low. QS 200 is absurd \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 besides finance Dartmouth is seriously average. keep coping :/",

So where do you attend? Is it better than the seriously \"average\" dartmouth? At the end of the day, dartmouth grads will earn more than whatever you are capable of earning with that petulant coping mechanism of lying to yourself just because you couldn't achieve what some people could. btw, princeton is much larger than dartmouth and it is less undergrad focused than dartmouth is. Just pointing out the flaws your preposterously ostentatious comment. Dartmouth is also not only recognized in the \"northeast\". It is recognized by all S&amp;P500 which is why their median salary is 4th highest in the ivy league. Maybe you couldn't make it because you don't have the capability to corroborate whatever comment you are making.",

Regardless of where you go to college, there is a very good chance that you will work/live in/near a large city after college.\n\nYou have a chance to live in a \"rural\" place for 4 years. Hanover is very different than most small towns, it's very wealthy and picturesque, and the adults generally have way more formal education than those in most rural areas... but it's still a small town. I think there are like 6 stop lights or something like that.\n\nYou probably won't want to live in a place like Hanover after college, but it's a great place to live during college. I'd recommend going to \"Dimensions\" which the admitted students weekend. I came to campus that weekend almost 20 years ago, and it sold me on Dartmouth for sure.",

Collis is great as you can customize the stir fry and pasta with whatever toppings you want from the salad bar. When I was a student there was also a fresh sushi bar at collis where I would get avocado sushi frequently. The HOP is generally also pretty customizable in terms of requesting they omit the meat from the various menu options. I was not a FOCO fan but I think there are lots of choices there as well. Foods are well labeled by dietary restrictions so it\u2019s easy to know what you can and cannot eat.",

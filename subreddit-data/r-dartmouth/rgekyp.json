You'll miss those cheap amazing seats when you graduate!\n\nKeep in mind that all your peers are in the same boat as you--they haven't been to college and don't know what to expect either. But you'll all have a wonderful time learning together.\n\nDon't overpack for when you first arrive--you can always have your family send you more of your stuff (or buy more stuff) later. The dorm rooms are nice but not palatial.\n\nIt gets cold--have a good coat and good shoes. You will not be able to wear flip-flops year-round. (A Californian friend of mine thought she would be wearing flip flops year round. She changed her mind before the end of October.)\n\nSpeaking of weather--Hanover has five seasons: Fall, Winter, Mud, Spring, and Summer. Have a pair of shoes you don't care about for mud season.",

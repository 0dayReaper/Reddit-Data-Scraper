    "postText": "Hello, I'm an incoming 27 and I was wondering if there is a way to palce out of a course if I feel like I already know the curriculum. I took AP Econ but was not in the best place at that moment so I got a 4 instead of a 5, but I genuinely believe I know all of the curriculum well, especially now. Does anyone know if there's a way for me to still skip ECON 1 by writing some kind of test? I really wouldn't want to take introductory econ again. Thank you!",

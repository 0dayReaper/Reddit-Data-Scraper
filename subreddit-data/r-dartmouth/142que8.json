    "postText": "Hi there,\nI'm a recent graduate moving to the dartmouth area in the fall for work. I know no one in the area, and everything that I've seen regarding finding roommates is to use dartlist. I've filled out a request two weeks ago and haven't heard anything back or seen them posted on dartlist. Does anyone know how long it usually takes for them to review requests for people not associated with the college? I'm hoping they just haven't checked it yet,and not that my post request was denied for some reason.",

If you do have a NetID and a dartmouth.edu email address, they should [register](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/dartlist/dartmouth-register/) you and give you access. \n\nDartlist is run by the [Sustainability Office](https://www.sustainability.dartmouth.edu/), so try calling them if you need to get to a human. There's no helpline or anything on the Dartlist that I could see lol welcome to Dartmouth!",

            "comment": "Premed courses are pretty prescribed for the most part. There are some things you can take instead of others, but the real question you should be asking is which profs to take, not which courses. The profs are who actually make or break a course. Dr. Kull (biochem) and Dr. Aprahamian (orgo 1) were some of the best teachers I had at Dartmouth. There are also some good premed courses elsewhere, like in sociology. I took the Health Disparities class, which ended up helping guide some of my clinical research after undergrad",

            "comment": "HUM 1/2 was great, i had great profs and great ppl in my classes, youll be doing essentially the same amount of work as writing 5/seminar ppl (give or take depending on the prof). HUM 1 wasnt rly intensve, a decnt amount of reading, not too much, and we got to revise our first 2 essays. HUM 2 workload was lighter than HUM 1, and we got to choose whether to submit revisions for our first or second essay. Overall the HUM sequence is great, awesome profs, cool books, interesting \u201cfield trips\u201d/presentations, and rly smart ppl to be around",

I would say that on average, there were more readings assigned for hum1/2 students, but assignments were about the same. I\u2019d say check out some past fys (seminar), writ5, hum 1/2 classes, and see what interest you.",

Hours are limited (2-3 hour-long sessions a week), but it's a great way to keep up your own skills and make good money - they pay you for an hour of prep + hour of actual drill, so if you're quick/don't need to prepare a whole lot, you make 20+ an hour. I did French drill for most of my time at Dartmouth :)",

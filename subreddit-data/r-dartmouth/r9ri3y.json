    "postText": "A few of us, (Matched QuestBridge students) created a discord for the class of '26. We obviously don't have school emails yet, so we thought it would be a good way to connect with other students before the 22-23 school year. Feel free to join, especially as you get accepted and whatnot. Even if you aren't yet accepted, we don't mind having you either. Thank you!\n\nlink : [https://discord.gg/NrXBDZVWg9](https://discord.gg/NrXBDZVWg9)  \nor discord.gg/XmtZTrvvkk",

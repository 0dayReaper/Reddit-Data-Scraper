    "postText": "I've decided to remove some of my clothes (like, ones I haven't worn for 2 years), and I do not want to just throw them away.

They are in good conditions, my styles just changed a lot during the past year or so.\n\nI don't have a car in the area, so out of the Dartmouth campus (or Hanover) would be tough for me...",

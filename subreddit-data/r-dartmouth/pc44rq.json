I was wondering if anyone could speak on Greek Life or just social life in general/how they were able to make friends in college. Much appreciated thank you!",

Luckily, you don't have to worry about Greek life for a bit, as first years aren't allowed at houses until after Homecoming, which gives you some time to get the lay of the land.",

As a nerdy, geeky, generally non-partying person, I still made plenty of friends, did end up joining a coed Greek house (and even becoming its President), made friends with folks across campus life including a couple of football players and other varsity athletes, a cheerleader, etc. \n\nIt's absolutely normal to be anxious about finding one's place in the social life, but I also absolutely promise you that you will.",

Invite people out to lunch with you, chat with people in your classes, join clubs or sports you like, etc. Get onto groupmes and go to stuff when you're invited.\n\nThere is no rigid social hierarchy. I was a certified weirdo in high school, and I dress kinda weird and am super awkward, but (because we're adults here) that does not matter. It's easy to establish a fake social hierarchy in your brain -- \"she wears better clothes than me, he's too good to talk to me,\" -- but you have to remember it's not legit. Football players aren't shoving anyone into lockers. Actually, the football players are overwhelmingly nice and chatty.\n\nRemember that people want to befriend YOU too, and don't be afraid to invite people to hang out or get people's numbers! Looking forward to welcoming y'all '25s in the fall : ) Have a good time on trips!",

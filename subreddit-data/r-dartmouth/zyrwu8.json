I want to drop this class because I feel like it really isn\u2019t giving me very much in return. Most of it is stuff I legitimately learned in middle school. Should I just power through? If I drop it, how should I let Dartmouth know/how should I ask?",

            "comment": "So unless something has changed in the last few years, you can only have one term where you take 2 classes in order to get enough credits to graduate. So if you drop it now without being enrolled in 3 other classes, then you're burning your only chance to do so. Personally I'd save that for a term where you have to take 2 particularly tough classes at the same time, which is fairly likely to happen at some point in order to take everything for your major since many classes are only taught 1/year\n\nHopefully it fulfills some distrib at least, but tbh having an easy class is very far from the worst thing most of the time. If you already know the material you shouldn't have to put much effort in anyway",

I would power through, because in our acceptance letter it basically says to maintain our academic/ extracurricular involvement/excellence and that any negative changes could result in a review of our acceptance. I\u2019d speak with your guidance counselor and ask for their thoughts first though and go from there:)",

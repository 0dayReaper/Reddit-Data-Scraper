    "postText": "A little confused on the on-campus parking situation. I'll be living at Summit on Juniper this fall and commuting to campus. In getting a parking permit I have to choose between a-lot, dewey, or dewey, ledyard, and lewiston combined. There are other options, but all those are free. Should I be getting the pass that includes three areas? Or is it dependent on what school I'm in. Would love to know if I'm missing something.",

Get the one that lets you park at the Ledyard lot. You\u2019ll walk up 2 sets of staircases that plop you right up at Tuck next to where your program will be. \n\nGreat new building by the way.",

Earlier the better on that one.",

The longest possible walk across opposite ends of campus probably takes 20min or less. \n\nBikes get stolen only if you leave them unlocked. But it\u2019s more like they get \u201cborrowed\u201d by people late at night and you can find them if you look hard enough the next day. People aren\u2019t cutting locks. If you want to bring a bike, just make sure you lock it up and you\u2019ll be fine.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am a riding senior interested in applying to Dartmouth. Obviously I\u2019ve heard of Dartmouths heavy frat culture and was wondering if anyone could give more insight into what it is like. Is it similar to other larger public schools? Do you feel FOMO from not being in one? Is there a heavy drinking culture? Any response would be appreciated, thanks!",

Yes, Dartmouth has a frat culture, but it isn\u2019t forceful and you don\u2019t have to be in one. I still had a great experience not being in a frat and still having a great social life! People are nice, and although like many colleges, there is drinking, nobody made me drink and I didn\u2019t feel left out not drinking. IMO, Dartmouth is what you make it out to be and you\u2019ll find your group of people!",

And while there\u2019s a drinking culture, you can enjoy your time here without ever drinking with little to no pressure to drink.

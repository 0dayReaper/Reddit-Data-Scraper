They have it all figured out for you, and you\u2019ll be able to drop your stuff off before your Trips section. \n\nIn terms of actual logistics: you usually pick up your key from MidMass, which is pretty close to the Green. Your comment history suggests you\u2019ll be in McLaughlin - it\u2019s sort of on your way, so not that much of a hassle to bring your luggage over to get your key. That said, you can also probably drop it off at your dorm first / find someone to open the door for you if you don\u2019t have your ID. Nobody will steal your stuff.",

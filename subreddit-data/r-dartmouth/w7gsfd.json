    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a rising first-year student at Dartmouth and I stumbled upon the Great Issue Scholar webpage on the Dartmouth website. I realize that it has quite an early deadline and made me curious about the possibility of there being other programs like these with early deadlines. Is anyone aware of programs besides the Great Issue Scholar program that are available to first -years as well? I also wanted to know if there are any available to students for sophomore, junior, and senior year. I know it's quite a bit of info to ask for, but I want to make sure I can make the most out of all resources offered at Dartmouth. Thanks for your help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers!",

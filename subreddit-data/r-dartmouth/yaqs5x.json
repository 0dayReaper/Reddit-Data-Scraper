            "comment": "pro: the really really close community. from an academic standpoint, you almost always can chat with the professor about questions (something not super easy at bigger places). I cannot stress enough how impt this is, esp if you are a question-based learner. from a social standpoint, everyone is super chill and knows each other. most spaces are open to everyone, and you can really form tight groups.\n\ncon: the lack of anything nearby. honestly, the isolation is really limiting at times esp if u don\u2019t have a car. there\u2019s not really a grocery store in town, so ur basically stuck with few restaurants and dining hall food 24/7. the same isolation makes greek life so prominent. i enjoy going out, but often it feels like drinking and partying are too ingrained for on nights",

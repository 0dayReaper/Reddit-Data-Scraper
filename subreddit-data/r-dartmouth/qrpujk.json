    "postText": " \n\nProfessionals in Human Computer Interaction help in creating websites and apps for tech companies, SaaS cos, FMCG companies, etc; which is using the ideas of 'mass psychology' for commerce.\n\nUsing the skills accrued while working in HCI, MBA should help get the aptitude to slide into Private Equity; as managing / flipping a business is largely about knowing market consumption i.e. what market wants and cash flows  \n(not entirely though, talent management and etc too are required);  \nHence, an HCI degree will have transferrable skills of how consumption works and then an Ivy League MBA will help get foot in the door for buy side finance.\n\nI have a degree in finance from a regular college in Mumbai with a 3.0 GPA. Worked in State Street Bank for a year and then slid into advertising during the pandemic. Private Equity takes the elite of the elite of B School recruits and the aim is to sharpen your profile as one, hence I chose HCI as it is a easy transition for me as I am already doing the same work in advertising. The intent is to have a great profile and preferentially work in Management Consulting (as Accenture and BCG too have Ux roles) to sharpen up my profile and skills in making products for mass consumption and then get my MBA to transition in Private Equity\n\nMy questions\n\n1. How possible is it?\n2. What do I have to be prequalified with before applying for an MBA? Would CFA work? (large part of that is corporate finance)...Would courses from Wall Street Oasis, Peak Frameworks, Corporate Finance Institute work?\n3. Do they need pre MBA industry experience or will it be the same ritual ie working in M&amp;A for an investment bank first after MBA and then get in PE after some experience?\n\nAlso, the aim for MBA is either Ivy League or M7 college like Dartmouth or bust",

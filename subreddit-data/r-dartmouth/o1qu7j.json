Incoming students will receive more information about First-Year Trips through New Student Orientation in early June. Hang tight, stay safe, healthy, and happy and email us at doc.trips@dartmouth.edu with any questions!\n\n\n\nMy guess is that they want more time to see how normal a Trips experience is possible with COVID.",

Upper-level leaders will welcome and connect you with peers as you begin to find your own sense of place here.\n\nEach group will spend a few days on a specific activity, such as canoeing, performing arts, cooking, backpacking, rock climbing, organic farming, and everything in between.\n\nRegistration details to come soon",

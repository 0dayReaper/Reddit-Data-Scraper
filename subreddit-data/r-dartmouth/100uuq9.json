    "postText": "Hi, I have a few questions about Dartmouth!\n\n1) I feel like I either see people who vehemently hated their time or loved it vs the more middling responses I see about other schools. Why is this?\n2) Is Hanover an expensive town?\n3) Is the dating scene just hook ups, particularly if you\u2019re in a frat/sorority?\n4)  Do you notice a shift in the younger classes and their profiles (like are they more artsy, less Greek or more Greek, less econ more econ)\n5) Are there a lot of bugs in the dorms?\n6) Is the government major difficult?\n7) Why do people say Dartmouth is anti-intellectual?\n8) Best dining hall food?\n9) Favorite Memory?",

            "comment": "I'll answer a couple\n\n1. I don't think this sentiment is actually held on campus. The wide majority of people I'd say have decent times. Some terms are worse or better than others but most people have a middle feeling about Dartmouth. The polarized opinions will often float to the top, especially on the internet. \n\n2. It's definitely not cheap. It's a rural town that caters to a mostly wealthy student/ alumni population. Off campus housing and food will not be super cheap. If you go to West Lebanon you can find fast food, a Walmart, and other more regularly priced things. \n\n3. There certainly is a hook up culture, but I wouldn't say it's any stronger than any other college. More serious relationships happen all the time. It is just what you are looking for. \n\n4. Not quite sure what you are asking here but most classes will be fairly diverse. While certain years admissions might favor one major or trait over another, by and large each class does not have a defining characteristic. \n\n5. Not particularly. Depends on the dorm and the season. Sometimes fruit flies can be a little bit of an issue however in my experience there are no more bugs than a typical home. \n\n7. A decent part of Dartmouth has a work hard play hard mentality that from an outsider's perspective can look \"anti intellectual\". Certainly you will meet people who are not looking to have particularly deep discussions, but that's true at any school. I think the wide majority of students can and will participate in \"intellectual thought\" in and out of the classroom.",

            "comment": "I pretty much agree with Stecat's answers, so not gonna repeat those. I enjoyed my time there but would say closer to middling than hate/love. Classes were generally great with a few exceptions, and socially had a small friend group but didn't really involve myself with a lot on campus (partially due to being introverted and partially to leaving campus frequently to see SO)\n\nFor favorite foods, Foco cookies and general Tsos was always popular but personal fave was either Collision mozz sticks or bbq chicken wrap with a hash brown from the Hop",

The govt department median grade is B/B+. So in some government classes, you will see grade deflation. Usually professors are pretty good at making their tests hard enough that deflation doesn't happen.\n\n8. From Foco: calamari, cuban pork sandwich, grilled asparagus, oh and of course ALL the pies. Best fruit pies ever.\n\n9. Kayaking with friends during sophomore summer. The river is super easy to walk to from campus - less than 5 minutes from Thayer iirc and Dartmouth has kayaks/paddleboards available - one year membership is like $50 for a year.",

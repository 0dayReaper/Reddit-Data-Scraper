If you get in ED, the financial aid that they give you with your acceptance letter isn\u2019t 100% accurate, it\u2019s just a sample based on your EFC. The actual financial aid comes out a few after RD which should include other costs like health insurance and loan eligibility. Still, the ED financial aid should be very accurate",

Listen to them. \n\nAnd perspective is everything. A lot of freshmen don\u2019t realize that everybody come in was top of their high school, etc. So they will think that they\u2019re capable of more than average, then get absolutely humbled. Just adjust your expectations and your standards.",

Expect to spend a lot of time on homework, and stay ahead on it rather than procrastinating. Have fun but remember at the end of the day you're paying to take those classes so don't become that person who skips classes constantly and does the bare minimum",

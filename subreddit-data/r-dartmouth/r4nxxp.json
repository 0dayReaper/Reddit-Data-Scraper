Alternatively, if you'll never take a class with them again and they're outside of your major's department there's nothing to lose. I've several friends who've done it successfully. \n\nIn the future, I'd recommend approaching professors in the first half of the course to ask what their criteria for giving out citations are. That way you have a defined set of results to work towards and they know to keep an eye out for you. Sometimes profs don't even know that citations are a thing so it can also work as an excuse to loop them in.",

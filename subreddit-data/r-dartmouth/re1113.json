Yes, Dartmouth has worked with students to revise their financial aid.\n\nMy parents are divorced and Dartmouth originally took my into account my father\u2019s income when creating my financial aid packet. I worked with a school counselor, gathered documentation that proved only my mother supported me, and provided it to the financial aid office. They then provided me with an updated financial aid letter.\n\nSo yes, Dartmouth is willing to review financial aid, but you\u2019ll have to come prepared with a case/ documentation to justify higher aid. \n\nHope this helps and that everything works out!",

            "comment": "u/Secure-Hamster-411 made some good points. However, I would warn you that it's definitely possible they won't revise your aid unless you have a legitimate reason. Your reason cannot be \"I thought I would get more\" because you applied ED. Applying ED is basically accepting whatever aid they give you (if any).",

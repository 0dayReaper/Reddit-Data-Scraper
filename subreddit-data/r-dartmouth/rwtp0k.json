Get a jacket with lots of pockets so you can fit gloves, balaclava, and a hat. Put it all on every time u walk outside and you\u2019ll be snug. The stillness of winter nighttimes make up for the cold.\n\nWith this strat I basically got away with wearing long pants and short sleeved shirts all through winter. Get a nice pair of boots, though.",

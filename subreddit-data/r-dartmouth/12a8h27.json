            "comment": "I went to Dartmouth undergrad and majored in Engineering and only did the BA (AB) with lots of CS.  \n\n\nLoved it. and was able to combine my interests and take classes outside of my discipline. The AB/BE wasn't an issue at all for recruiting -- got offers by the major tech companies for software engineering/product roles and consulting / finance places like McKinsey.  Had friends do the BE to stay an extra year and also had friends do grad school at amazing places (Engineering/CS but also medicine and law).   I was also able to intern creatively using the D-Plan to figure out my interests.  \n\n\nEngineering program was awesome.  Lots of 1-1 work with professors who were very accessible and students were very collaborative -- lots of team projects (Engines 21) and students helped each other with problem sets in the Great Hall - several times in the evening, even my class professor stopped by to help and chat with students.    Engineering research is readily available and professors are always looking for help and undergrads get to do grad-level research.  New Engineering Building brings CS and Engineering together and even though there is a graduate program that is growing, Dartmouth's engineering program is very undergrad focused and relatively small.\n\nCan't recommend Dartmouth Engineering (and Dartmouth) strongly enough.",

Don\u2019t just take the ba unless you\u2019re a biomedical engineering major and premed or you have a good reason to not want a be",

It's something that is kinda holding me back from applying. What fun things are there to do in Hanover besides hiking? Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Most people are pretty wrapped up in what\u2019s happening on campus with Hanover as a sort of back drop. All sorts of clubs for various interests, music/theater performances, football games in the fall, hockey games in the winter. Parties and social events Wed, Fri and Sat, Programming events like concerts, movies at the Hop, BBQs and cook outs, trips to the Ravine Lodge, ice skating and sledding, dorm events, swimming in the river, etc. \n\nIn Hanover there\u2019s a movie theater, good restaurants and cocktail spots including bakeries, Thai, Sushi, Indian, Italian and Chinese food, some stores for gifts and clothing items, a bookstore. \n\nBoston is two hours away and NYC is 5 hours, both with frequent bus service, Burlington, VT is 2 hours, Montreal is 5.",

Growing up in Boston, two hours from Hanover by bus with frequent bus service, I imagined I'd be going back to the city frequently, but I found that there was almost always too much going on on campus for me to want to head to Boston.\n\nThere's all the clubs for interests, the performances at the Hop are amazing and for $5, an AMAZING deal (seeing some of those artists in the real world are $100-250 a pop, easy); the Programming Board brings some great people to campus; sports games; parties; guest lectures; world class political and intellectual figures come to campus; during the Presidential primary season, all the candidates make their way across NH, Hanover included; snowball fights; etc., there is SO MUCH to see and do. In some ways, the caliber of the guests that Dartmouth brings to campus is higher than what you might be able to easily/cheaply access living in a city.",

It's a small town in the middle of some gorgeous landscape. There's a big campus social focus because there's not many scenes outside of that. But there is beautiful nature all around, some good food if you know where to look (e.g. Four Aces, Trailbreak, Stella's, Cloudland Farm, El Cortijo, etc), and good people to share those experiences with. If you're really itching for a city, Boston, Montreal, and NYC aren't too far away either",

    "postText": "Just curious because I live nearby and am a freelancer (the whole laptop + coffee shop thing), and the dartmouth library just seems like the perfect place for me to come in sometimes to work from on my laptop. Plus the opening hours are great. \n\nI remember doing the same thing years ago at NYU and McGill (and the security being super strict at NYU for obvious reasons) but I had close friends in both places that would get me in. Here I have no one so I'm completely clueless. \n\nDo they check student IDs? If they do are there like visitor passes and stuff like that?",

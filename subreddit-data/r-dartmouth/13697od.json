    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming graduate student starting this fall. I am interested in Summit on Juniper, especially the [3b2b apartment](https://summitonjuniper.prospectportal.com/lebanon/summit-on-juniper/student/). I want to know how do people usually split the bill since the rooms are not equal-size and two of the rooms have to share one bathroom. Or... everyone pays the same. \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Just an FYI, but the general graduate student community is pretty opposed to Summit on Juniper. I live nearby, and heard a lot of bad things from people who were staying there - there was no central heating for like 4 weeks (?) in the middle of February where temperatures were consistently in the single digits/negatives, people complain about the work quality of the apartments themselves, etc. You can read Google reviews for more details, but just wanted to make you aware of the situation surrounding the complex. Housing is hard to find here, but you still might want to avoid Summit.",

The best bet seems to be Summit. A 2 bedroom flat is closing for over 2700-3400 USD + utilities. \n\nAre we missing something here? People are saying Summit is very expensive but everything other than summit seems more expensive.",

Management has routinely violated both lease and legal regulations with little regard for tenants. As a current (and soon to be former) resident, only go with Summit as an absolute last resort. As others have mentioned, there are major heating issues as well as many other problems (see the Google reviews for a thorough and detailed accounting).\n\nWith all that being said, and to answer your original question, Summit leases by the bed and full unit prices are divided as such. So, each tenant in a 3bd/2bth would pay 1/3 of the full unit price. Also, the prices they list online are per bed not per unit.\n\nFinding housing in the upper valley is hell. This was the 3rd time I've had to go through the circuit and find a place, but if you have time to be diligent about it, you can find semi-reasonable places - especially if you dont mind a commute - on places like Dartmouth Real Estate, Dartlist, and the laundry list of apartment/rental websites.",

I have noticed that people discussed these problems in this sub, and I have spent a lot of time searching for housing options on different platforms. A senior grad recommended Sachem Village to me because it is cheaper, close to campus, and has a good environment. But I have noticed that there is little information available regarding Sachem Village (people living there prefer not publishing their sublease openly?)  I also check Dartlist, Dartmouth Real Estate, and Zillow a lot for housing options in downtown Hanover. While downtown Hanover is convenient, the available housing is either expensive or overcrowded (like 4b2b or 4b1b). I also came across unfurnished houses, but I am hesitant about the potential hassle of purchasing and moving furniture. Do you think the furniture thing is troublesome?\n\nWhat I want is a place that costs less than $1200/month, includes necessary utilities, and is convenient to campus. :(...",

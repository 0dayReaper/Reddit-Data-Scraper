Even though some of the other comments may have you convinced that a 1440 is good enough, it\u2019s barely 25th percentile according to the class of 25 profile, and you have to consider that the median is impacted by athletes and legacies as well. It sucks but, internationals (especially Indian ones), are held to a higher standard in the admissions process and a 1440 won\u2019t help in the slightest. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s impossible for you to get in with that score, just that you would rather go test optional at that point since it\u2019s definitely not helping.",

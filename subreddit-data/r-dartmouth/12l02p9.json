I got my first summer internship after my first year by contacting a Dartmouth alum who lived in my hometown.  \n\n\nDartmouth career services is pretty strong.  All of the major consulting, finance, and software places hire interns and full-time employees from Dartmouth.  Even hedge funds and private equity like Bridgewater and Blackstone actively recruited when I was there.  Never felt like the was a shortage of software engineering, finance, or consulting internships or opportunities.   All of the Dartmouth alums I met at these places were friendly and generous with their advice.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Finding internships will be very career/ major dependent. However as a whole Dartmouth has a pretty strong alumni network that tends to hire Dartmouth grads or at least are able to network with. The career services are pretty helpful and I'd say most people have gone to them at some point in their Dartmouth career for resume help, mock interviews, etc.",

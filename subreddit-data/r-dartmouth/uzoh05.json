Crew as a sport is known for having people join with no experience and then gone on to row at the Olympics. \n\nKeep an eye out early fall term and they\u2019ll have info sessions for Novice rowers. It\u2019s a great time to try it out. \n\nIt is an incredibly beautiful place to row and the boathouse was recently renovated. It can also be an incredibly cold place to row. Pack long Spandex. :)",

    "postText": "Kid toured Dartmouth and loved the campus and academics but was sort of freaked out by the fact that everything seemed to be heavily Greek (70% of students.)\n\nHowever, a much older alumni said it was NOT \"normal\" Greek life: that lots of people were in \"social\" groups which were NOT national orgs, and that it was very different--almost as if it had a ton of interest housing and just called them \"greek.\" \n\nCan anyone explain this a bit? It was looking like her first choice until she found that out (she has no interest in a traditional national sorority.)  Would hate for her to walk away from it based on an inaccurate assumption.\n\nthanks in advance",

My favorite part of the Dartmouth frat/party scene, and what made it stand out so much initially for me, is that there are regular frat/srat events that are emailed out to the entire campus. Everybody is welcome; you\u2019ll never hear about guys getting turned away b/c of ratio, or really anybody getting turned away for any reason. Of course, there are invite-only events, but the fact that frats/srats will literally email out to campus about their events speaks to the inclusive nature of the events themselves. \u201cInclusivity\u201d in Greek life is a different question, I just mean inclusivity of the events.\n\nI would definitely say it\u2019s not a \u201cnormal\u201d Greek life. Every Greek house is much different than one you\u2019d find on a campus down south. Even the rule that you can\u2019t rush until sophomore year sets us apart right away, not to mention that rush itself is a completely different process: you can\u2019t be kicked out during rush term, so it\u2019s not even really \u201crushing\u201d in the traditional sense \u2014 once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re in.\n\nDoes she have a specific worry with attending a school with 70% affiliated students? I think knowing that would be helpful as well. Also, just surf this subreddit for a bit and you\u2019ll find a lot of other information about alternative social spaces. For what it\u2019s worth, I had no interest in joining a fraternity when I entered Dartmouth, too.",

                    "comment": "Basically this covers it all. I never partied in high school and was v intimidated by the alleged \"party scene\" at Dartmouth. Bottom line: it's there if you want it, and you don't have to use it if you don't. I did end up joining a local sorority, because I wanted to meet and forge relationships with upperclasswomen. It turned out great. I made some of my best friends who I likely wouldn't have met otherwise (but now can't imagine my life without). \n\nDue to my comfort level and financial situation, I rarely drank at parties. Nobody cared. I was never hazed nor compelled to drink by anybody ever. My sorority absolutely had drinking traditions/rituals, but you were always explicitly told that you could opt for a non-alcoholic beverage, or tap in another sister to drink for you. \n\nI also spent a good chunk of my time with non-greek affinity groups on campus. Events are inclusive, if she wants greek life it's there, if she doesn't want greek life there are plenty of other ways to socialize on campus.",

            "comment": "I was in a local sorority and we would joke that one thing we had in common was that all our friends and family were surprised we had joined a sorority bc we weren\u2019t the sorority type. \n\nAbsolutely would not have joined a house at another school but D\u2019s Greek scene is different as others have mentioned. It\u2019s very open and welcoming and while a lot of people are Greek it\u2019s not the only thing people do so it\u2019s not your entire identity. Not everyone lives in the house, meals are not in your house and people regularly go to events at other houses. \n\nPlus the fact there are local houses.  It was so empowering to have our own sorority house where women were in charge and hosting parties and events for the campus. Friends who didn\u2019t rush were always welcome at our house and other orgs would hold gatherings at our house regularly. \n\nA few things to keep in mind - you can\u2019t rush until Soph year so freshman year is about your Trippees and floor friends. You don\u2019t have to decide about rushing right away. As I said, people who were not in a house hung out in houses regularly, and it was totally fine to be in a house and not drink as well.",

                            "comment": "Hi -- I am a current student (graduating in 23). Everything that has already been posted is still true here. I'm not a part of Greek life myself, but most of my friends are. People don't get turned away from campus-wide parties, and people are (for the most part) hyper aware about not forcing others to drink, keeping an eye out for creeps, etc. \n\nAlthough I opted not to be in a sorority, there are lots of women here who are in sororities who would not have rushed at any other school. Greek life is way more chill here, and you don't have to be a part of it to go to events. It also helps that you can't rush until sophomore year.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how much I did not want to be involved in Greek life when I came here. My mom was extremely involved in Greek life at her SEC college, so I knew a lot about it and I knew it wasn't for me. But our Greek life could not be further from the \"normal\" Greek life scene. \n\nEven now, I'll go to parties at frats or sororities, but at the end of the day I'm not affiliated and I'm happy with that, and no one thinks it's weird.",

If we include non-reported ones... putting it this way, make it a challenge to find ONE Dartmouth senior who doesn't know at least three students got sexually assaulted, and I guarantee you no one will win.  \n\nSome frat threw banana peels at a black student a couple years back and the college buried it. \n\nOut of the top US schools, Dartmouth is probably the least diverse one. If you're in a frat hangout with only white dudes, the conversation can get really racist really fast. The most frequent ones are \"I'm concerned about the browning of America\" and \"AA is racist against whites\", just to name a few.",

    "postText": "I'll be in McLaughlin in the fall (I'm a '23) and I'm thinking about parking options as I have a car on campus that I frequently use. A-lot is so goddamn far and I'd like to avoid parking there again if possible.\n\nDoes transportation services ever give out permits to students or student employees for anything that isn't A-lot? Even like Dewey lot or the one in front of McLaughlin. Or should I look at Greek house parking? Please comment if you have other suggestions. Thanks!",

You can also negotiate parking with some of the Greek houses. Or if you have a friend in a Greek house which gives free parking to its members, you could have them sign up in exchange for occasional use of your car, etc.",

            "comment": "Hi! Potential MES major/minor here!\n\nThe Arabic Department here is PHENOMENAL regardless of which prof you get (Prof Chahboun, Prof Bouba). They\u2019re all so incredibly sweet and thoughtful of their students and truly take pride in their teaching. \n\nGrade medians for Intro Arabic series (intensive or not) are at an A. Profs are super accommodating and enthusiastic about what they teach!\n\nArabic1 is quite slow paced but picks up in Arabic2, so perhaps you might like the combined 1&amp;2 series more. \n\nThe best way to succeed in this course is to take passion in your commitment to learn the language and make use of the office hours if you have any questions. Don\u2019t be afraid to make mistakes and to speak up if you have a question!\n\nClass sizes are small (maybe 7 students/class), so everybody is learning together and will likely be in the same boat as you in terms of difficulty/learning the ropes. So many friendships(and even relationships) have come out of the Arabic classes at Dartmouth which really speaks to the sense of community and passion everyone who takes Arabic at Dartmouth has.\n\n\n\nThe only downside about intro level Arabic is, like other intro language classes, are the drills. Highly recommend morning drills since class is pretty soon after.",

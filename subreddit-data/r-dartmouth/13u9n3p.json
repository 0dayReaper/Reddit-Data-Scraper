You can see the previous options from last year, but note, they are subject to change for fall \u201823. Make sure to stay updated on the pre arrival portal and admitted students website. Let me know if you have any other questions. Hope this helps \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\n\nHere you go: [Link here](https://outdoors.dartmouth.edu/firstyear/registration.html)",

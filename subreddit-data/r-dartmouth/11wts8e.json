However I did get an email from idoc telling me that a college wanted this doc like 5 days before the Dartmouth email yet at the time of the Dartmouth email I still didn\u2019t upload the doc. Should I have gotten the email since I was missing documents at the time the email was sent? Or do u think IDOC sending me the email meant that Dartmouth wouldn\u2019t separately reach out?",

For me, I got the email from Dartmouth on March 9th and the following day (March 10th) I got the request from IDOC stating that an additional college was requesting information. I was having issues submitting the tax return information so I didn't actually submit my forms to IDOC until a week later. I got the same email from Dartmouth again a week later (probably because they still hadn't received my documents). It's hard to tell whether this means anything or not, so I would take it all with a grain of salt and just wait until decisions are officially released on the 30th.",

If everything seems to make sense to them, I don't think they'd need to send a personal email about those things. Just my thoughts though",

Either way, neither of us actually work in the financial aid office so we\u2019re both just speculating at the end of the day. I didn\u2019t mean to come off as negative, just putting my two cents out there",

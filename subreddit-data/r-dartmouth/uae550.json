            "comment": "Classes are very limited in the area. You have to mostly remain on a waitlist for weeks if not months. Because of the limited classes, they\u2019re also very expensive. As an International, you should also know that in NH, if you don\u2019t have a license from your home country, you have to mandatorily take driving classes. This means you cannot learn driving from someone you know. Because of this reason, a lot of students just show residency in Vermont (use a friend\u2019s address as their address) and get their license from Vermont. In Vermont, you don\u2019t have to take classes and learn from anybody and appear for the test directly. You can transfer your license to NH once you get it.\n\nI\u2019d recommend getting the license from your country, if possible. If you have a foreign license, you can use it for 60 days (i think) and appear for the test directly without taking any classes.",

There are also a couple private driving schools - Warners is one of them, but I don\u2019t know anything about it.",

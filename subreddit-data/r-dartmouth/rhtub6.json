    "postText": "Hello, everyone!  \n\n\nProspective econ major here with a bit of a dilemma. While I signed up to take Econ 3 next term (preceded by Math 1 in 21F), I'm thinking of taking Math 3 instead. \n\nDoes anybody have any advice or any helpful commentary on what the course-load was like for Math 3 and what there experience was if they took it in 21F or in-person? (were the portfolios that awful?? were there any midterms/finals?) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated!",

No midterms or finals and the problem sets looked pretty light. I\u2019m sure if you worked hard in the class you\u2019d be fine. The portfolios suck but they\u2019re not a gpa tanker",

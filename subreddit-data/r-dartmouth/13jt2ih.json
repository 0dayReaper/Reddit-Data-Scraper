    "postText": "I\u2019m wondering what options there are for bringing a car your first year. I\u2019ve looked around online and it looks like you aren\u2019t supposed to bring one your first year unless you have a valid reason like a job? My girlfriend will be going to college about three hours away and won\u2019t have access to a car so it\u2019d be a lot easier if I could bring mine. Is there a way for me to get a \u201cvalid reason\u201d to bring it or find parking somewhere else somehow?",

            "comment": "Yeah, welcome to Hanover: where parking sucks! You're probably going to hit a brick wall with \"Transportation Services\" but there are (expensive) alternatives outside of the College. The Town of Hanover has some [parking options](https://www.hanovernh.org/246/Leased-Permit-Parking) \\- for your case I noted this detail: \n\n&gt;There are surface area permit spaces in the Central Business District   \npriced at $90 monthly and some on Lower Lebanon Street and Hovey Lane   \npriced at $80 for a two-month period.\n\nMaybe you could try it out and see if it's worth it for what you need the car for. Otherwise, pretty sure some frats will lease you a parking space. \n\nThe Dartmouth Real Estate Office is part of the racket as well:\n\n[https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/rental-property/parking](https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/rental-property/parking)\n\nGood luck!",

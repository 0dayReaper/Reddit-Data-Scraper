Dartmouth is an ivy and people drink more when there\u2019s more pressure like any other ivy. Don\u2019t let alcohol be a deterrent for you to apply.",

I don't think that we're unique in that regard. \n\nI think that this rumor has to do with the (false) perception of Dartmouth as the \"Party Ivy\". If you want to go to parties and drink, you can. If you don't want to go to parties and drink, you don't have to. I was in a sorority while there and went to events sober the grand majority of the time. I just didn't feel like drinking most of the time. I was never judged or pressured (except I was iced on my 21st birthday by one of my best friends-but that was the exception, not the rule, and I was a willing participant, lol). There are also plenty of activities/communities available where there's no alcohol. I was a member of one of the faith-based groups on campus and all of our events were dry. We had Friday night movies, community dinner, hikes, etc, etc. Plus if you're looking for secular and dry fun, any even put on by the programming board is also a great option.  \n\nWith that being said, I heard about Dartmouths \"party\" reputation after I'd committed. I do think that it would've made me think twice when I was in high school because I was (and still am) a square. But after actually participating in the social scene there, I can assure you that it's really not extraordinary. The party scene is really just what you make of it; just like what you'd find at any other college.",

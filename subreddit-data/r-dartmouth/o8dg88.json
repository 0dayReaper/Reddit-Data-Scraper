We are going spend the night in Hanover Wednesday, June 30th and do a bike tour the morning of July 1st.\n\nHe would love to meet a current (or recent) undergrad.  If you are in the area and would be willing we'd love to buy someone dinner June 30th at popular dinner spot for students.  If you are interested would you kindly send me a message and we can sort details?  (Happy to give you my linkedin and that sort of thing ;-).\n\nThanks!!",

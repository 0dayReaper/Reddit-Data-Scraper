    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'd be grateful if someone could please answer some questions:\n\n1. I was wondering if Dartmouth's engineering program suffers because of the quarter system? I looked on some other engineering college sites, and they don't accept credits from colleges which have a quarter system. Cornell, California schools etc. Do Dartmouth engineering graduates get similar opportunities for internships / work experience as graduates from those schools? Has anyone managed to transfer out to one of those schools? \n\n2. I like that I can try a couple of different areas at Dartmouth before focusing on one kind of engineering, but I want to graduate with proper credentials. It seems like the computer science degree is comparable to other schools. is this a correct assessment? Meaning that as a CS  major I might be able to compete with graduates from tech schools, but not as an engineering major.\n\n3. Please can someone also explain how the alumni network works? I've heard it is very strong at Dartmouth. Have any current / recent students got internships or jobs because of alumni referrals (not counting parents or family friends)? How does this work? Do alumni respond to random students sending them emails asking for help? I looked at a list of famous alumni - they are mostly lawyers / judges. Are there any engineering alumni who stay involved with the school by sponsoring students?\n\n4. \\^same question regarding Greek system. Again, 'people say' it's useful for 'creating a network'. What does this mean? Does it help anybody get a real internship or job? \n\n5. How do engineers get jobs out of Dartmouth? It seems like the big engineering firms do not recruit there. Maybe because a lot of the big firms do cars and rockets, and there is no aeronautical at Dartmouth. A lot of internships ask for a BS/MS in a specific field from a top ranked engineering program - does a Dartmouth engineer qualify for this?\n\n6. I saw that there is a formula racing team - are they well-ranked? Is this still happening in covid? Their social media stuff is all from a few years ago, so I can't see if they are still active. \n\n7. What are the facilities like? Is there a wind tunnel? Do students get to work with ultra cold gases, etc. Does Dartmouth have the expensive lab equipment that bigger schools would have?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I'll try to be pretty brief in my answers but feel free to ask clarifying questions.\n\n1. Doesn't suffer. If anything, you can take more courses in the same timeframe as a semester school, so you can get broader training if that's what you want. Dartmouth engineers have the same shot at internships as everyone else, but it's up to you to pursue them and build experience while you're at school so that you stay competitive. I had friends work for NASA, Tesla, SpaceX, Google, etc.  Not really sure why you'd transfer to another engineering school after you get into Dartmouth though. If you want a more technical school, then just go to a technical school\n\n2. You get an ABET-accredited BE from Thayer, I don't get what you mean by proper credentials. Some of my friends double majored in CS and engineering, you get good training if you work hard. Majors don't make smart people, hard work does\n\n3. Our alum network really is that strong. I had many friends get internal referrals from companies, and I got a couple job offers based off of alumni connections. Some alums work with the Thayer career office and say directly that they're open to contact from current students. Others don't do that, but they'll still reply to cold emails. Really just depends on the person.\n\n4. We don't have professional frats, so you're not going to have industry-specific groups. That said, some houses attract certain personalities, but engineers are all over campus. Greek houses are good for building strong networks of friends, and you may happen to make a couple professional friends along the way. But they're there as social outlets, don't just join to get a job\n\n5. We get jobs the same way everyone else does, and big firms do recruit. See the Thayer Job Fair if you don't believe me. We don't have a direct aeronautical track, but you can build the experience for yourself if you want to.\n\n6. Formula racing is fantastic, but as with most of my other answers, it's what you make of it. We have a solid track record for the last few years, and you can get great exposure to various systems and processes if you try at it. I can't speak to DFR in covid, but it seems social distance-friendly.\n\n7. Facilities are great for fabrication and analysis. We have a full machine shop with CNC, 3D printing, and various other setups, as well as SEMs, crystallography, and material properties testing rigs. I don't think we have a wind tunnel, but students still get to do a lot of cool things. Expensive lab equipment is shiny, but a lot of that stuff at other schools is reserved for grad student use. All Dartmouth facilities are available to undergrads and that's huge, including the expensive equipment some labs have acquired.\n\nJust as a general note to you, I get that you're not a current student so its hard to have perspective, but a lot of your information is superficial. If you're looking at Dartmouth as a stepping stone that will pad your resume on the way to a larger engineering undergrad program, don't do it. Just go to the bigger program. Transferring is a lot of extra work for no guaranteed outcomes.\n\nRankings are important, sure, but they're not everything. Nor is expensive equipment. Find a school with an engineering culture you enjoy. Big programs can be pretty cut-throat or malignant, and that's not at all the culture at Dartmouth. Dartmouth profs are passionate and involve undergrads heavily in research. We also develop strong soft skills that a lot of other engineers miss, and you'll have a blast working with your peers",

            "comment": "If you want an engineering specific tech program, don\u2019t go to Dartmouth. Make sure you go to Dartmouth because you love Dartmouth - all of it. The engineering program is indeed very strong and the above respondent addressed your questions adequately. You will have no issue finding a job or a network if you step up and do your own part; but Dartmouth is no MIT/Embry-Riddle, etc., you\u2019ll be taking a very diverse liberal arts focused curriculum with classes that apply to absolutely nothing you ever thought you\u2019d be interested in. Broaden your horizons and enjoy a varied education at Dartmouth, or, go somewhere more engineering-focused.",

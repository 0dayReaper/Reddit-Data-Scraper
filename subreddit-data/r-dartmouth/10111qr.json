    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a \u201827 and had a question about placing out of classes. \n\nI know that dartmouth allows students to place out of introductory classes with ap credits, but I\u2019m kinda hesitant to do so with my calculus bc credit cause I\u2019m not a mathy person. This also applies to other ap credits I have - I\u2019m just not super confident in my ability to recall these info. + (I really want to try to make my freshman year as chill as possible)\n\nBut I also heard from students from the discord/from this sub that intro classes are generally something to avoid because of the large class size. \n\nWhat would yall recommend?",

            "comment": "So I could have placed out of Math 8 due to my Calc BC scores, and decided to take it instead because I didn't feel confident.\n\nTurns out Math 8 is a bitch, and has more focus on the more difficult concepts from BC Calc than the other options (series). Looks like they've added a Math 9 that replaces series with linear algebra, so you can do 9&amp;13 as an easier option instead of 11. Just don't refuse the placement and take Math 8 imo\n\nWhat are the other AP credits? In generally I'd lean towards taking the placement, but while you're getting used to school take at most one difficult class and a couple layups. Earth science has some good intro classes for a science distrib that are pretty easy but also interesting",

I don't have direct experience with physics or econ, but in general I'd say that for the more difficult majors that the intro classes aren't necessarily easier that the actual classes. In some/many cases they're fairly difficult \"weeder\" courses rather than an easy intro\n\nHere's a useful link, though you'll need a Dartmouth email for full access https://www.layuplist.com/\nYou can see course medians though, notably Math 8 being a B and the others being a bit higher typically",

Is it cliquey? I know it\u2019s a small school so I was wondering if people self segregate\n\n2. Is it, overall, a liberal campus? I don\u2019t expect it to be like, say, Brown, but I do want a vibe that feels nonjudgmental and socially aware\n\n3. What is the gay population like?",

I am unsure of general political makeup but it's a small liberal arts college. College Republicans have brought some questionable speakers, and there were protests. Its isolation from any major city does seem to lessen the direct impact of political influence. \n\n3. Yes, pretty openly queer campus. Some of my friends expressed frustration about the queer hookup/dating scene being toxic but I never got details. Decent number of events and spaces authored by and built for queer people. \n\nHappy to answer any other questions!",

    "postText": "I'm a FT software engineer with \\~4 years of experience. I received my BS in computer science from a no name school and was wondering if a MS in computer science at Dartmouth would be worth a shot? I see graduate CS is ranked 49th in US News and World Report. I'd consider working for the school if roles are available, but I'd be willing to go with a remote role while living in Hanover. In the long term, I want my MS degree to open me up to the possibility to going into a good phd program. Also, how is Hanover for people past 25? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Close friend and partner did the MS over two years recently. Their motivations were to potentially move on to the PhD program, but both ended up getting more appealing full-time jobs towards the end of the two years, following good internships the first year. From what I've gathered it was a good opportunity to work with interesting professors doing cool things of your own design. We're all in our late twenties now but still live in the Hanover area and are mostly interested in hiking and outdoor activities; there are definitely young professionals groups and bars in a couple surrounding towns but we haven't been interested. It's a really beautiful area with lots of activities of interest if you like exploring the outdoors and community-centered events.",

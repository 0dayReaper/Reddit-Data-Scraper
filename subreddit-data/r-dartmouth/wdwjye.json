You may also have done some work at Dartmouth, or know Dartmouth professors. Then there are other factors, the impacts of which I\u2019m less sure of, including that admitting more students from the area (will depend on where in NH you are) helps the College build good will there, which in turn is useful for the College when it wants to get new construction, etc. approved.",

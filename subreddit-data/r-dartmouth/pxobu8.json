There\u2019s an active Greek scene but it is very open to non members. Parties are open to the campus and you\u2019ll likely have friends in all the houses given the size of the student body. If you aren\u2019t in to Greek life there are a bunch of other groups that have very active calendars such as the DOC, volunteer groups, arts, improv, clubs, sports, etc. It\u2019s very easy to get involved and as a first year you\u2019ll need to be thoughtful which groups you allocate your time to.",

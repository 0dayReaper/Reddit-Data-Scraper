I was hoping for a more detailed account on the research programs (especially for psychology) that Dartmouth offers and what\u2019s it\u2019s like working in one of them (how helpful are the mentors, what can a student actually learn, whether or not there\u2019s legacy-based preferences when getting selected to one).\n\nAlso I come from a very student-directed Highschool (that is nearly every major event is student-organized) and I\u2019m wondering whether or not it\u2019s the same for Dartmouth. How competent is the student body here?",

            "comment": "You mean for undergrad? I actually did Dartmouth undergrad and Stern postgrad. \n\nAs you mentioned, they are incredibly different schools. I would spend some time thinking about how you envision your college experience, and what you are trying to get out of these four years. I wouldn't trade my time at Dartmouth for anything, and I know that's the case for most alumni. You've probably heard that it's a cult, and that's true to some degree - it's about as unique of an experience as you can get in college, with a lot of tradition and exists in a quasi-bubble (for better or worse). That uniqueness, isolation, and continuity of experience leads to a very loyal alumni network. Dartmouth has a strong identity and is very much the classic \"college\" environment. And Dartmouth people love Dartmouth people.\n\nThat said, NYU has a very strong, albeit different, offering. I have friends who did undergrad there, and they enjoyed themselves and remain close with their friends from those years. The school loves to say that the city is their campus, which in turn reveals the fact that they really don't have much of a real campus (unlike Columbia). I personally was very interested in a traditional college experience, which is why I chose Dartmouth. \n\nAs I'm sure you suspected, it very much depends on what you personally are looking for out of your college years.",

One advantage of Dartmouth is the D-plan -- so i was able to intern at a great tech firm during my winter term when internships were less competitive.  I also felt I had lots of options -- e.g, if i didn't want to pursue banking, there were consulting, tech, and hedge funds like Bridgewater recruiting.  Dartmouth alums are also incredibly helpful as GhostTrees mentioned -- Dartmouth people love Dartmouth people.\n\nDefinitely recommend Dartmouth if you're thinking about working in finance.",

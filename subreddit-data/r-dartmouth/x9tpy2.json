Your SAT score is a bit on the lower end, so I'd only submit the ACT unless you're willing to retake the SATs to get higher than those median values (especially if you're Asian or Caucasian). \n\nYour grades are more than good enough. I finished my undergrad 7 years ago though, so the abbreviations are a bit lost on me. I assume you're taking AP courses, and you should definitely submit those scores as they will help both in admittance and knock off course requirements should you be admitted. \n\nWhat are your extracurriculars like?",

Your application looks a lot like mine did when I was applying to Dartmouth - little higher ranking in dance, but that was the entirety of my extracurriculars because I also taught dance as well.",

Beyond that there\u2019s a lot luck involved and the officer who reads your app needs to advocate for it so you need to have a strong essay(s).  Applying ED gives you a better shot.",

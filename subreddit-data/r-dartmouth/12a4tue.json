Are you defining how good a program is more on salary outcome or on teaching? If it\u2019s by the latter, I think Dartmouth would be great given the faculty size. Do you like pre professionalism? Do you like being in a mid sized city? Or do you like  a campus culture vibe?",

My point was more asking what OP thinks a better program entails. I do think however that it is more student culture that\u2019s a driver than ability, as the pressure to succeed is higher in a preprofessional school over an academic yet more laid back one.",

            "comment": "Dartmouth has invested 250 $ million in a fantastic new CS building!!! In addition, it has greatly expanded its faculty almost up to 40 people!\nLastly, it has great tradition in CS. After all, it was there where the term AI was heard for first time, and the place where BASIC language was invented!!!\nFor undergraduate students it is a paradise. Small classes, great teachers scholars, and abundant research and job opportunities. My daughter, a senior now, had paid research positions all the quarters during these four years. And not only her. Anybody interested in research secured a position!!\nNeedless to say how valuable this has been for her PhD applications. She has been accepted to another Ivy which was her first choice and other great programs. \nHer colleagues also secured great jobs post graduation.\nHard to beat Dartmouth 's Alumni network. \nOf course all three schools are great and you cannot go wrong regardless of your choice.",

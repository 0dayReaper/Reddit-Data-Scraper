    "postText": "Hello everyone, I just received an offer from Dartmouth Quantitative Biomedical Science master's program, and I have some questions about it.\n\nMy career goal is to get a Ph.D. degree in biology (especially in bioinformatics, epigenetics, and oncology), and become a professor at University. However, I think QBS is more suitable for industry instead for academia. Should I accept this offer? Thanks for everyone's suggestion.",

If you\u2019re dead set on getting a masters it\u2019s a good stepping stone because you\u2019ll have research opportunity but it\u2019s very class heavy and a lot less research than a PhD. A masters will help your chances of getting into a PhD program but isn\u2019t a requirement. At Dartmouth if you are a PhD student in another program you can internally apply to the qbs masters and not pay the tuition.",

I did get interview invitations from other universities, and if I received offers, t's definitely will be a hard choice for me.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The reason why I am applying for a master's is that my  PI suggested I be open-minded, and I thought two years of master's experience could not only help me decide my final research interests (i.e. epigenetics or oncology, concentrating in informatics/stats or biology, etc.), but enhance my application. Therefore, I wish I could gain research experience and keep good relationships with professors, and apply for the Ph.D. program two years later. Also,",

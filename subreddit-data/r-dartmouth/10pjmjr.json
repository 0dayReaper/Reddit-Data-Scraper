If the admit rate for deferrals was like 50% or something, then you\u2019d know that deferrals are relevant. Don\u2019t think too hard about it and good luck.",

During these months I have changed my intended major and applied as a public policy/pol sci major for all my RDs. I think that public policy is the right fit for me since most of my ecs are focused on community and advocacy kinds of work. Do you think I should email and ask them or will they think I'm indecisive since I made a 180\u00b0 turn?",

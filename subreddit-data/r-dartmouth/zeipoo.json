All those who make it to committee could be potentially admitted. The list of these individuals would be sent forward to the finaid office, which may eventually send out the finaid email.\n\nYet, these candidates are only a pre-emptive short list. You could be rejected at committee. You could be deferred. You could be accepted. The door is still wide open for deliberations on your application as they begin to shape their class. If you've ever seen the \"inside the amherst admissions office\" video, that's what you should envision here. A group of AOs sitting around their mahogany table as they vote on your final admissions decision. \n\nIf a lack of an email indicates an early rejection (as many posit), the presence of one isn't a sign of acceptance either. You've just moved to the next stage of the process.",

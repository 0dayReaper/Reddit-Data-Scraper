    "postText": "I'm an ED admit and I'm going to negotiate for more need-based financial aid, but I have a question relating to outside scholarships. On Dartmouth's website, they say that outside scholarships may be used to cover the \"student contribution\" part of the financial aid package\u2014so does that mean outside scholarships CAN'T be used to cover the EFC? If so, that's a big problem, because I'm looking to third party scholarships to really bring the net cost down.",

Do you you think there's a chance I could negotiate with the FA office to reduce the  EFC and increase the student contribution? or is that a stretch.\n\nAnother thought is to negotiate with scholarship providers in order to make the check out to me and not the college itself, but that also seems difficult.",

It's possible maybe they'll increase the student contribution so that you can use more outside $$, esp if you give them some reason to think your earnings or savings are higher (like if savings reported as your parents is actually yours etc.) If an org will write you a check just to you that is ideal but many won't. I hope it works out!",

In some cases, outside scholarships may be used to reduce the expected family contribution (EFC).\"\n\n[https://admissions.dartmouth.edu/glossary-term/grants-and-scholarships](https://admissions.dartmouth.edu/glossary-term/grants-and-scholarships)",

The coca cola scholars program, where you submit an application similar to college apps and certain people are selected to receive an award.  You can find them through online research and scholarship search engines.",

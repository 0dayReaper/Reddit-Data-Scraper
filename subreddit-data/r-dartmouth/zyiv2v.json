            "comment": "as mentioned one wheelock is probably the jack of all trades for what you are looking for but if you like the atmosphere of small cafes there's multiple cutesy non chain restaurants and cafes on main street, Novack, Back of the Napkin, and Collis for on campus. If your looking for a place to just relax most of Collis is meant for students to use to socialize or study, blobby (Baker Lobby) + first and second floors of Berry are open for talking and hanging out with friends while studying or doing work, and most times people will just chill by thenseleves in the common rooms of their dorm building and usually other people living their come by and join them. In the summer, spring, and (part of) fall terms The Green is a big social and relaxation spot to do whatever. hope this helps!",

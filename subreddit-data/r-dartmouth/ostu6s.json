    "postText": " Over the past month, I have created the website [RateCollegeClubs.com](https://RateCollegeClubs.com), pretty much RateMyProfessor but for college clubs. College students can search their school and club, then read reviews left by other students. During my freshman year, I went through a list of literally 1600 clubs just to figure out which clubs to join. Then, I sat through a couple boring ClubFest Zoom calls just to figure out I didn't want to join the club anyways. As a result, I developed this and hopefully we can get enough reviews to make the website useful for other students. If you are/were involved in any clubs in college, leave some reviews!",

    "postText": "Class of \u201828 sports recruit here. I\u2019ve already seen a [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/p90183/ed_dilemma_williams_college_vs_dartmouth_college/) about this topic from about a year ago but I wanted to ask some more questions.\n\nI will probably try to major in CS or Economics or both (take some classes in both at least) and I also want to go to graduate school after undergrad, maybe even law school. I know that Dartmouth has a good CS program, while Williams is still trying to catch up with theirs (I know they\u2019re both pretty much LACs). Both have world-class economics departments and I\u2019ve also heard good things about Williams\u2019s math department, and math is a subject that I find interesting so that\u2019s a pro for them. Overall, I'm still in the middle between both schools' academic programs.\n\nIn a competitive public high school, my GPA will probably be around mid to high second decile, and my SAT is 1510: Dartmouth and Williams are both still super competitive though, but I feel like it would be easier to get \u201clost\u201d at Dartmouth, especially with its quarter system, party culture (distractions), and competitive Ivy League student body: more valedictorians probably attend Dartmouth over Williams. In u/LethalVenom1\u2018s post there was also a comment saying Dartmouth will have more competition for a grade because of enforced medians while Williams fosters an environment of struggling together for a grade. I\u2019m just trying to hedge my bets on my chances of getting into a top grad school.\n\nOn my sports program choice, the actual level of the Dartmouth\u2019s athletic program is only slightly better than Williams\u2019 program but the gap is noticeable: if I was choosing based on sports program alone, it would be Dartmouth in a heartbeat for their coach, but I would still thrive in Williams\u2019 team in the end.\n\nI want to be ambitious and take advantage of all there is at Dartmouth, but Williams would offer similar resources and might be less stressful. Which college should I follow through with?\n\nUpdate: Committed to Dartmouth (4/25)",

I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s math program is better as well.\n\nWilliams is *small*.  When I conduct interviews I tell people, Dartmouth is smaller than most universities, but it\u2019s big enough that you\u2019re sure to find your group. (If you\u2019re a fan of Vonnegut, your karass).  I think that\u2019s important, but maybe your team would be your default group, so it might not matter as much.  You don\u2019t say your sport, but if the coach is that much better, then, well\u2026.\n\nI don\u2019t want to hate on Williams, it\u2019s a great school, and it might be the place where you\u2019d better thrive.  Your gut is important here.  I have a niece who has several state records in javelin.  She just selected Bowdoin over several D1 offers because that\u2019s where she clicked.  I respect that too.",

I majored in CS and did well career-wise coming out, as did most of my peers. The program is good, I have few reservations about it. Dartmouth also just completed a new building (ECSC) for both CS and engineering. I was leaving when that finished, but it looks as if they\u2019re investing heavily in both of those departments for the near future. I\u2019m not knowledgable about CS at Williams.",

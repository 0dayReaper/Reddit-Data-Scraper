What are your opinion on Sachem Village and Summit on Juniper (which I read terrible stuff about). Any help is more than welcome. Thank you!",

            "comment": "I moved here for work at the hospital, so I don't know about the graduate school culture specifically. But Summit Juniper is less than a year old, so at least you know everything will be in brand new condition. I imagine the biggest complaint about it is distance -- it is probably 2 miles from campus. Its a beautiful and easy bike ride in the warm weather, but for 6 months you'll be stuck driving or taking a bus. \n    \nSachem village is a weird little suburban neighborhood stuck between sports fields and beautiful 10 sq. mile forest. It is also a mile or so from campus. My impression has been that it is very family-oriented. \n \nFor hospital workers, most new people end up in Timberwood commons. Super boring apartment complex -- its right across the street from Summit Juniper and a fine last resort.\n\nDid you look here: https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/dartmouth-rentals? Finding a rental apartment in town is probably your best bet",

Silver would be shared by  the insulting responses by the property management company (\"here, have a single space heater!\") AND Dartmouth (who lacked any conviction or urgency until the grad union flexed).  But the gold would be the lease terms, where [you are on the hook for a whole year if you have to break your lease.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/11i18v7/summit_on_jupiter/jax591b/)",

There are a few available right now here, so you can see what you'd be getting into: [https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/dartmouth-rentals](https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/dartmouth-rentals)\n\nA lot of my friends live or used to live in Sachem Village. It's fine. Expensive for what you get, but that's everything in the area. There's a bus to campus during the week and it's close enough that you can walk in a pinch. If you want to save money it should be pretty easy to find someone to share a two-bedroom apartment with. Other grad students tend to be too busy to cause trouble, but I totally get wanting to have your own space.",

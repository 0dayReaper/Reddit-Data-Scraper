    "postText": "How does parking in A-Lot work in the winter with snow? Do they plow out the snow in the non-parking spot areas of the parking lot, such that there\u2019s still snow in front of the cars to get over? Trying to figure out how important ground clearance and AWD are for just getting out of the parking lot. Any help/insight would be greatly appreciated!",

Number 1 tip is to park so you pull forward from the spot rather than back out, and if you're driving frequently in the winter then buy winter tires",

The a-lot does get regularly plowed, but it can still require a decent amount of shoveling to remove the snow immediately surrounding the car.  I don't think you need to worry about all wheel drive or ground clearance, just make sure to have snow tires and a snow shovel",

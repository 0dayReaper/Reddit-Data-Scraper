    "postText": "I got placed into WRIT 5 but I\u2019m hesitant about taking it because I don\u2019t want to overwhelm myself first term. I consider myself an okay writer and English classes definitely aren\u2019t my strong suite but I can manage. For reference, I plan on taking Psyc6 (neuroscience major) and one other course (which I haven\u2019t decided yet) this fall term.",

It\u2019s designed with freshmen in mind, so just read layuplist reviews of profs carefully when picking a section and you\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s fine if you aren\u2019t a good writer, the whole goal is to help everyone improve their writing. Just don\u2019t take a second paper-heavy class.",

We've been almost everywhere around. Obviously just two people's opinion, but...\n\nBest overall: Worthy Kitchen in Woodstock. Requires reservations, but it's so worth it. \n\nBest in West Leb: Lui Lui. Italian place, wood-fired pizza. Fun atmosphere. Great pasta.\n\nOur personal go-to: New Thailand Cuisine in Leb. This will be controversial because of Tuk Tik and Pim's Thai Orchid, but this is the best Thai food in the upper valley imo. We've returned here more than anywhere else. \n\nAlso notable:\n* Han Fusion (best restaurant in Hanover, Chinese food)\n* Sawtooth Kitchen (new place in Hanover, they have super good fried chicken. Haven't been for the live music yet but the food is good)\n* Absent from the upper valley (in my experience so far) is an excellent burger/shake place. So we go to Five Guys in west leb a lot lol. It's fast casual and obviously it's a chain, but it's still the best burger around. Broken Hearts Burger up in Fairlee is a better, local burger place, but it's kind of out of the way (unless you're going to a drive-in movie in the summer, which I also highly recommend!)",

    "postText": "Hey! I'm a '26 and I plan on taking econ 1 and math 3 for an econ major but also wanna explore CS 1 and French 1 which happen to be pretty challenging from what I've heard.\n\nDo you suggest I take econ 1 and math 3 in my freshman fall term or should I pair math 3 later down the line with CS 1 ( or maybe with some other class like gov, french etc.) ?\n\nAre econ 1 and math 3 manageable together? If not, then is it still possible to complete pre reqs for the econ major in time so it doesn't hinder me down the line i.e. if I space out econ 1, math 3, and CS 1 along with french 1 over the entire freshman year?",

            "comment": "You could check layuplist to see how people rate the class in terms of difficulty, ik econ has a fixed B+ median so it\u2019s probably an average difficulty class for the first year (I\u2019m a 26 as well so this is just what I\u2019ve heard). CS 1 is supposed to be easy if you have any CS experience before and an intro French class probably isn\u2019t that bad. Math 3 is probably the hardest class, depending on your math abilities. So I\u2019d try and take math 3 separate from econ 1. But that\u2019s just what I\u2019d think",

ECON 1 and MATH3 may be manageable, but it depends on how comfortable you are with math (be aware our math department isn\u2019t exactly the most loved)",

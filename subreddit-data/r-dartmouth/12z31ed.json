            "comment": "I'm white and Jewish, just recently graduated. Dartmouth is large enough that there are both kinds of groups. A lot of friend groups come from programs or groups that cater to people that share an identity. Sometimes this is explicitly centered around nationality/ethnicity/culture (i.e. international orientation, La Casa, Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, Hillel), and sometimes this is unintentional (sometimes it is also problematic and part of the educational/economic inequity Dartmouth students might experience).\n\nThat being said, these \"groups\" are absolutely dynamic and I've been in friend groups of just Jewish kids, as well as groups where finding anything we all have in common might be a challenge. It depends on what context you're in, and it isn't a shock to see groups of folks who share an ethnicity, nor is it a shock to see diverse friend groups. A large part of the liberal arts ethos is learning from your peers and making connections to people from all walks of life. I learned a f**k ton from my friends. I am a much more mature, aware, and empathetic person than I was when I first came to Dartmouth. I think a lot of my friends feel similarly, regardless of their own background.",

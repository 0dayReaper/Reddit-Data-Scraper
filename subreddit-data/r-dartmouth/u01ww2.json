It\u2019s a hand-selection process, so there isn\u2019t going to be one mold that Byrne Scholars fit in, and even if you were to find something that all of the Byrne Scholars have in common, there\u2019s other Dartmouth students that fit those criteria that didn\u2019t get selected for the program. With an admitted students class as talented as Dartmouth\u2019s is every year I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something we\u2019re missing, so if you find that lmk I guess?",

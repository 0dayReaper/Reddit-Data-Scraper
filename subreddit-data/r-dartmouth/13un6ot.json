    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI\u2019d just like to ask all of you what kind of winter jackets, specifically, do you use for Upper Valley winters? Brand, type etc. Looking to get something warm and GORE-Tex. Is it a good choice?\n\nAlso, what about base layers? What brands have you found to be good for this purpose, being comfy and warm? \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Jackets:  LL Bean is awesome (and New England) and very popular.  North Face and Patagonia are also great.  The best is something that is Goretex outer on top of down (look for high loft like 500-750)\n\nyou DO NOT want polyester insulated - not nearly as warm as down.  \n\noften called a parka.  slightly longer and usually with a hood.  over a fleece on super cold days.  \n\nhttps://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/60850?page=baxter-state-parka\n\na midweight down jacket is great for the cold but not brutally cold days.",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nAs a typical college student, I love free things and love discovering free things that Dartmouth offers to students. I'm currently trying to compile a list of these free resources for current and future students (congrats '24s!) so it will be easier to find, since a lot of these resources can be kind of niche to find or scattered around the various Dartmouth sites. Making this list kinda helps justify the tuition since the college literally has some many licenses to stuff and I've discovered some cool places on campus in the process.\n\nSo far I've gotten all the news subscriptions, free access to Lynda/LinkedIn Learning courses, Safer Sex Bar at Robo, BorrowDirect (which I personally think is one of the most underrated resources out there),  Bloomberg certification training, Teatime at Sanborn and a few other random ones. This obviously is pretty sparse compared to what's out there, I'm sure, and I'm curious to hear what other people have found useful during their time here.\n\nMy big goal is to make a full functioning site that promotes these resources along with the free things that students offer, like the Mental Health Student Union's \"Late Night Solace\" or events that have free-food. Would love to hear what other peoples' free findings on campus are :)",

If a sentence could be copy pasted to another schools prompt, it needs to be changed. 100 words isn\u2019t a lot, so you need to use them wisely!\n\nAlso this advice goes for any \u201cwhy this school\u201d prompt :))",

Also they pay for everything so do not worry about finances.",

Through the department directory for my intended major at Dartmouth (their Dartmouth profiles list their individual research projects -- mostly books or articles that **most** academic people write, hence I see no particular stuff that stands out to me as \"exceptional\" ifykwim)\n2.

I was writing about Earth Science and remember mentioning one of the laboratories and the professor who worked there and how that type of lab was the only one of its kind in the country. I found it on the \"Labs and Facilities\" part of the earth science department website. Do keep in mind the website never said it is the only one in the country, but I was quite confident it was. It had a very specific and unique sounding name I guess, and it related very closely to what I had worked on in high school Check out the page I am talking about and hopefully it makes more sense:\n\nhttps://earthsciences.dartmouth.edu/research/labs-facilities",

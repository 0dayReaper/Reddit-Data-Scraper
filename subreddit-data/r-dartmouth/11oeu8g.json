I had to write a letter explaining why they slipped, and I essentially just had to own up to the fact that I fucked up (although I was very sick for a few of my finals and one of them actually dropped me a full letter grade, and I said this in the letter.) Don\u2019t worry unless they reach out, and I fucked up BAD. You will be fine dude",

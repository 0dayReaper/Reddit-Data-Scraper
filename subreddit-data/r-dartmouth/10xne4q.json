    "postText": "I'm a freshman who is looking to transfer from my school and Dartmouth is the #1 college I would want to transfer to, but the transfer acceptance rate is insanely low. I am wondering if anyone who is intimate with the admission process could give insight into whether I would have a significant (~&gt;10%) chance of getting in.\n\n-I go to a NESCAC school\n-I got a GPA of 4.0 for my first semester with what I would see as a fairly rigorous course load (Physics, Calculus, Philosophy)\n-I am continuing to take difficult classes this semester\n-1560 SAT, 35 ACT\n-I'm in 3 different clubs on campus, but all are career oriented, and I have unfortunately yet to take any leadership roles\n\nIn summary, I'm pretty sure my academic statistics are decent enough for Dartmouth but even with that I'm not sure if I even have a meaningful chance upon applying.\nSorry if this an unanswerable question, just genuinely trying to avoid paying the application fees if it is a waste of time.",

            "comment": "you're correct that it's a sort of unanswerable question, but you also have good qualifications if the admissions office will view your course load to be as rigorous as you say it is. \n\nif you can indicate with confidence the reasons you believe you should be at Dartmouth *specifically*, then you will give yourself a decent shot. yes, the transfer stats are hilariously bad for hopeful transfers. if you decide to apply as a transfer, you should be prepared to lose the application fee with no reward. \n\nbut you also don't know the sample of people who apply to dartmouth as transfers, so you can't really determine your own likelihood of acceptance unless you apply. indicating fit in a really specific way (not just talking about fun traditions or whatever, but also why you want a Dartmouth education, the distinctions between dartmouth and similar elite and/or small liberal arts schools, etc) can be your most powerful tool at this point. high schoolers talk often about 'vibes' or 'dream schools'; as a prospective transfer, your power will be in viewing your education in a more mature way.\n\nthis is just my two cents, however. best of luck to you.",

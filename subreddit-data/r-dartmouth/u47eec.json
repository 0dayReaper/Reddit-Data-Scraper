If you had straight As all through high school and that was a high point in your application, admissions might have some concerns about grades dropping in multiple classes. Dartmouth cares a lot about \u201cintellectual curiosity\u201d and senioritis is sorta antithetical to that premise. I would avoid getting Cs if at all possible. Bs most likely wouldn\u2019t be an issue.",

    "postText": "Hello I am a 42-year-old male working full time but having a hard time to make ends meet. Majority of my money goes towards my son who lives with his mother, bills, food, etc.  \n\nLooking for a room to call home prefer furnished but at least a bed. I can do chores, am clean, and pay for own stuff. I just can't afford rent so asking on kindness of strangers.  I know it's a lot to ask and yes has asked friends family but none have room.  Is hoping for a miracle before I become homeless.  Enjoy life folks cause you never know what turns it might take. Thank you.",

    "postText": "Trying to decide between Dartmouth and a few other top schools for a major in CS with a focus in AI. Dartmouth from what I've heard has the weakest program for this area out of my options (albeit not by much, they're all very close), but I haven't ruled it out yet since I keep hearing things about the DPlan making internships miles easier to come by. Basically, I'm just wondering how big of an advantage is actually gives you with stuff, like whether it's a slight boost or if it's actually a major game-changer where you'd get internships you almost never could have gotten otherwise.",

            "comment": "I see so many posts about how Dartmouth's CS program \"isn't quite as good\" as some others, and I think that they really miss a big point about hiring.\n\nMaking up some numbers, no hiring manager is going to look a a student from the #10 program differently from the #12 program. The #10 program vs. the #200 program? Yeah, that'll probably matter. But there is way more individual variation between candidates than there is between CS programs in a given \"tier\". A good student from a #12 program is going to be a much stronger candidate than a mediocre student from a #10 program. So don't sweat the fine points so much. \n\nAlso, *soft skills*. For every asocial, supernatural programmer that gets hired because they're _just that good_ there are 10 (or 50) people who get jobs because they're competent programmers who are also, like, functional adults. \n\nSo stop worrying so much about the precise rankings and go somewhere that you think will help you become a (high) functioning adult. To that end, I think a liberal arts degree with a CS major from a school as good as Dartmouth is a pretty compelling opportunity.",

Many students actually prefer a smaller department environment - you definitely get to know your professors better here. It does come with downsides, though, e.g. we haven't had a deep learning class here in a year because the main deep learning professor got hired by Facebook (that'll be fixed soon though).\n\nThe term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was literally coined at Dartmouth, and the BASIC language was invented here too. It's a top tier department. If you're applying to serious CS jobs (or grad schools) from here they'll count Dartmouth the same as anywhere else in the upper tier, they care far more about your technical abilities.\n\nAdditionally I'll add that I'm a grad student with not many undergrad connections and yet I know three undergrads who are going to FAANG after graduation this year.",

You also have the unique opportunity where professors are heavily involved with student life, meaning they will help you put more where larger schools don't have that luxury. \n\nThe D Plan is why I attended because it gave me a lot of flexibility with internships. And internships are what lead to jobs. Your major won't carry as much weight as your internship experience when applying to jobs. \n\nAnd like someone else stated, networking is so important at work and finding jobs.",

And because there were fewer interns during \"offseasons,\" I could work on more significant projects. We could do full-time internships when other schools couldn't. I'm in tech, but I was a humanities major. Nobody has ever asked about my majors. They only cared about work experience and how it ties to the position. And as a manager, I care about the same thing. \n\nThe only disadvantage is how remote Dartmouth is. And you can't do an internship with a large company while attending schools like universities located in major cities. Students at NYU or Columbia have a big advantage there. That might change since more people are going remote.",

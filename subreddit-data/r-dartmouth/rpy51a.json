    "postText": "During my freshman year of high school, I was at the top of my class. I was coasting, and life was great. Then I transferred. I fell to the second decile of my class for two consecutive years (soph and junior), however I have recently worked my way back up into the top decile as of my senior year. \n\n90+ percent of Dartmouth students graduated in the top tenth of their class, so it\u2019s clear that for someone who isn\u2019t a recruited athlete, this is basically a necessity. However I\u2019ve only been in this category during the first and final years of high school. I talk in my app about adjusting and working to improve, but I don\u2019t know if I even stand a chance considering I was second decile for half of high school.\n\nShould I realistically apply? Please be honest, I understand how demanding and competitive the process is.",

I was just admitted ED, and my school doesn\u2019t even do class rank, so it only plays so much of a role. I believe in you! If you think Dartmouth is a good fit for you, I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t go for it. I hope to meet you in the fall :)",

Theres a million  things like this that I didnt get right (for eg: not submitting an additional info sec even tho I had one) and still got into Class of 26. It won't come down to this. There's more ways  to compensate for it like SATs, APs etc  and explaining it properly.  As long as your app is comprehensive and explains and humanizes your  situation, you'll be fine. If you're worried, dont apply ED and just go for RD instead. If you feel you  have a comprehensive app, ED  works.",

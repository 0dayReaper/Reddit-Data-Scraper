    "postText": "I was admitted in December and was talking to some domestic '27s who told me that they received a pretty cool box with fairy lights and their acceptance letter among other things. I didn't receive any of this and think it might be because I applied from outside the US and it's just taking longer for it to reach me... that or I put in my address wrong (which is honestly a very real possibility)? Have any international '27s received the \"congratulations!\" box thingy?",

More info about that process will come your way closer to your arrival date.\" \n\nHope that helps",

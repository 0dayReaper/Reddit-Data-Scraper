            "comment": "I'm a med student now after taking a few years before med school. It's not an easy path at Dartmouth, but adcoms know that Dartmouth doesn't grade-inflate and they give latitude for it. That said, it's a good place to be premed in that we're very collaborative, your peers aren't cut-throat about it. People study together a lot, bond in the hard classes, and support each other. The advising is hit or miss, but there are some real gems of profs in the premed track in a variety of subjects. The advising office will also help non-trad applicants, like me, which is really nice. They have a post-bacc job listserv and they'll still do a composite letter years after you've graduated. There are also a lot of opportunities for research. There aren't a ton of community service options in rural NH, but there are definitely good options like tutoring and you can use off-terms to do service and/or research and/or shadowing. Feel free to ask questions you have based on that or that I didn't answer",

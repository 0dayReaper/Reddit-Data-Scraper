    "postText": " \n\nHello, I'm from India, I am expecting a positive decision from Dartmouth as a transfer applicant(will be entering 2nd year). I also have a confirmed seat at UCL London in BASc program(3yr program will be entering as 1st year)\n\nWill there be a significant difference in feasibility of availing oppurtunities between areas such as New Hamsphire in US vs London in UK. Is that difference between rural and urban areas significant ?\n\nIf you had to choose between an ivy league such as Dartmouth vs UCL what would you choose excluding the tuition fee as a considerate factor?\n\nIn U.S a lot of colleges / unis are more liberal arts based while it is not necessarily so in the U.K. Its common for ppl in U.S to change their major atleast once before graduation? In U.K one does need certain amount of clarity as to what they want to pursue. Do you feel like liberal art institutions at U.S offer more breadth allowing students to explore when compared to U.K which might give them an edge in terms of whether any subsequent career choices are more likely to be globally optimal or meaningful. This is because you would have a broader knowledge of the landscape the world has to offer.\n\nOR\n\nDo you think London would provide a better horizon to seek more opportunities when compared to New Hamsphire?\n\nThough D-plan is flexible does the short terms due to quarter systems often leave students burnt out that they can't really make use of off terms ?\n\nFor the distribution requirements, do you feel like they were helpful or do you feel like you did'nt really see a point in completing a course which doesn't really fit your major?  \n\n\nDartmouth has various centres/sppaces such as Center for career service, for sustainability, for entrepreneurship, for theatre and art as such  do they work on huge scale   \n\n\nHow is study vs extracurricular culture. Like is everybody very very invested in EC's. Is it really too hard to get into clubs ?\n\nHelp me you all, the fact that Dartmouth's decisions are so delayed isn't helping me either",

            "comment": "You should decide if you want to try to move to US or UK after graduation, or just be in the US vs UK for a while. Generally, US has more job opportunities than UK but it gets complicated when you\u2019re not a citizen or legal immigrant. And Dartmouth has national recognition. \n\nAs for liberal arts in the US vs the more focused approach of UK, the liberal arts background sets you up better for adapting to change, growing into leadership when you need to take in information and opinions from outside your fired of expertise, interacting with people not from your discipline, background or culture. \n\nWhen I studied in UK, at parties, UK students were uncomfortable talking about subjects outside their areas, US students could talk about anything and if they didn\u2019t know, would ask questions to learn. UK students didn\u2019t seem to know how to engage outside their area though they knew a lot more in their areas than US students.",

It would help you get noticed but there are no guarantees, you still need skills, and to interview well. But you also get the Dartmouth alumni network to help you. And there are tools like LinkedIn that make networking easier. However, that\u2019s not the only path to the US, you could work for a big MNC out of the UK, then request a transfer to the US.\n\nI graduated Dartmouth in the 90s, working in product design for big UK MNC in the US. \n\nThere is no right or wrong answer, just which path will get you closer to what you want for your life.",

The river is far, but that makes you make the most out of your day instead of being holed in here. It also is near the river itself, so we have taken advantage of that. We are all also really close in here. The only thing that sucks is the second floor mens bathroom and the laundry situation. But you\u2019ll find that in any dorm.",

Living in Gile or Streeter as a first-year will probably get you a single, and it has perks of being central. But I would not trade McLaughlin for anywhere else.",

The folks who live in the River of Choates bond a lot. I would take that over having a single in a less social building - especially your first year",

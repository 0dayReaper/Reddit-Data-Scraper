            "comment": "Hi -- really depends on the internships and jobs you seek out.   I've found the actual major makes much less of a difference at Dartmouth versus your interests and courses.   I found my Dartmouth education was quite good at making me a good problem-solver.   \n\nI started out a math major, majored in Engineering with lots of CS, interned in both tech and finance places and chose consulting then finance as a career.\n\nI definitely would recommend taking several CS classes - Dartmouth's CS department is very, very good - especially Professor Jayanti.   I would also take Engineering 21 which is a fun group class where even some student projects get patents.  You don't have to be an Engineering Major to take these classes.\n\nFor Finance/Consulting/Hedge Funds -- I haven't seen much differences at all.  For Tech &amp; Product Manager internships - similar though taking some CS and Engineering (especially group) is helpful.   \n\nIf you are interviewing for Software Dev Roles  you do need to pass coding tests and I've found that to be very straight forward with the CS classes I have taken at Dartmouth\n\nGood luck!",

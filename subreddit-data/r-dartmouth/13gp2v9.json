If you want to work with individual professors on stuff you find interesting, then this is one of the best places in the world to do that. The best way to find professors you find interesting is to go on their webpages and read some of their recent articles. Not every opportunity for research comes pre-packaged in the form of a lab, and because Dartmouth is a smaller school I get the sense that individual researchers are a little bit more common.",

DALI may be the most known or vocal presence on campus since its primarily undergrads who work there, but all the other CS department labs are \u201cdeveloped\u201d and open to undergraduates too. I would recommend emailing profs who are listed on each lab\u2019s page if you\u2019re interested as a grad student; if this is the case, also look at faculty directory and look at each individual prof\u2019s page, and email them if you\u2019re interested in doing phd with them",

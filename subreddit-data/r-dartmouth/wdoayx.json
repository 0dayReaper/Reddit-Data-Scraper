    "postText": "Hey all. Some questions please. \n\n1. What's the AB/BE degree system exactly? I want to get a bachelor of engineering degree, but I want to know more about the system of doing a 4 year AB degree and adding a fifth year for a BE degree.\n2. What's the kind of jargon and inside jokes at Dartmouth?\n3. Which professors are well known among students within the engineering department?\n4. If I wanted to pursue a program that combines art and engineering, how would I do that?\n\nHelp will be much appreciated. Thank you!",

            "comment": "1) So, Dartmouth doesn't issue B.S. degrees. Most schools that issue engineering degrees issue them as BS, not BA, degrees. The B.E. is Thayer's response to that. It's an ABET acredited engineering degree. It's definitely doable to do it in 4 years, but you'll be busy. It's also doable to do it with only a portion of a fifth year (e.g. &lt;3 terms, or with less than a full courseload per term), which is another way to defray some of the cost.\n\n2) I wouldn't worry too much about this ahead of time.\n\n3) Well known in what way? It's not a big school, so most professors are well known to some degree.\n\n4) As /u/embossykitty said, you can do this. It's common for people who want to pursue architecture, among other things.",

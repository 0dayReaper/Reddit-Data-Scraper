But I don't think if they want to accept either of us, an English proficiency test would be the reason not to. They would just tell us to take the test again if they like our profile enough. Chill, if you get rejected it won't be due to an English proficiency test because its purpose is to show that language won't be a barrier, nothing more, nothing less. Calm down, you'll get the decision in like 6 hours. Breathe.",

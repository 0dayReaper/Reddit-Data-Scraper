    "postText": "I am an upcoming '27. Making a full-on decision is too far fetched for now but I have this idea of double majoring with modified majors\n\nEconomics modified w Psychology\n\nComputer Science modified w Engineering Sciences\n\nI am deducing that it will be a lot but 1. I want something that will always allow me to have options after college 2. I am curious and motivated to learn more about world and people \n\nAny thoughts on how all this might work out? \n\nP.s. would it be better to split one into major and minor or is it humanly possible go further with adding third major/minor?",

            "comment": "Technically doable. It will be hard though. Check out https://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Computer-Science for more info about major requirements.\n\nThe biggest issue is that you have distributive requirements as well: freshman writing 5 + seminar (2 courses), language requirement (1-3 courses), other distributives (likely the minimum you would be able to get this down to is like 3  courses, maybe more if it doesn\u2019t line up).\n\nSo: 11 courses for cs + cs1 and cs10 as prereqs.\n9 for Econ + Econ 1 and Econ 10 and math 3 as prereqs\n7 distributive and gen Ed courses.\n\nThat gives a total of 32 required courses for your plan. And many terms you\u2019d be taking three very hard courses at once. Doable, technically. \n\nAnd this is of course relying on you always getting the classes you need exactly when you need them which is not guaranteed if you are trying to take popular classes.",

Honestly, doing both together probably doesn't fit, and means you'll never get to take classes outside of those plans that you are interested in. Swap one of those to a minor (so like ECON-PSYC modified major and COSC minor) and I feel like it will be a lot less insane.",

I don't have the information about other placement tests yet, they could prolly narrow it down even more.\n\nEdit: comprehension",

I get that you might have lots of motivation or tons of interests, but I would expect you'll find the courses to be much greater depth than you predict at the moment. There's something to be said for having a breadth of experiences for sure, but it's also important to give whatever ends up being your main one/two interests the level of commitment that Dartmouth supports. I think a lot of Dartmouth students matriculate imaginging they will do combinations of 3-4 things as official majors, but end up having 1 or 2 majors or a major/minor so that they can experience more within those categories, while still taking advantage of Dartmouth's flexibility to take a variety of other classes to meet their other interests.",

Choosing a \"major\" is just what shows up on your degree, it's merely a label, but the freedom of Dartmouth is that you have the opportunity to take classes in all these subjects regardless! Fulfilling requirements for a major make your classes so specific and prescribed and setting yourself up for that restricts you from the ability to explore and actually experience the ups and downs of these interests which you've described, and often require you to take introductory level classes that are not that fun! Yes, you can explore all of these in depth. No, you cannot choose them ALL as your \"major\" -- that defeats the whole point of a major itself. Seriously, almost everyone comes in to Dartmouth and changes their trajectory completely once they actually take classes so while you can definitely keep prospecting, it's not worth the stress.",

            "comment": "I think it really varies. In general Dartmouth is on the smaller side so no class will be as big compared to most state schools. Obviously intro engineering classes/ general will have bigger classes then more advanced niche ones. I think the biggest engs class I had was around 100 (maybe even a little less) while the smallest I have had so far was 15. Most classes average around 25ish in my experience",

My large Religion 1 class was also 80ish, but had 10 person discussion groups to go along with it. My smallest was an upper-level Anthropology class with 5 people, the minimum number for a class to run.\n\nMost of my upper level major classes in Philosophy were in the 10-20 range.",

            "comment": "I'd say most of my engineering classes were 30 people, give or take 10, so quite small by most engineering school standards. The intro levels were larger, with maybe 75 at most, but even those classes get broken into smaller groups for a lot of work.\n\nFor liberal arts, that comes in for the soft skills in engineering. That means communicating and writing, both with other engineers and with non-engineers. Thayer students are stronger communicators than many other engineering school graduates and also tend to see things/problems more holistically because of the liberal arts training",

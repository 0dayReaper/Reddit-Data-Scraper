    "postText": "I got in ED, but amount of aid is not nearly enough. My family income is roughly 20k a year and they asked for 30k a year which is just unrealistically unaffordable for me. I want to appeal but am a bit confused over the process. I was wondering if one of you guys could help? Also how much can the price range change after appeal?",

            "comment": "Schools look at income AND assets. As an example, if income is $20K, but family has $500K in assets, they expect the family to dip into some assets (not all).  It wouldn't be fair for a parent to decide to retire while a kid is in HS (with $$$ in funds, business or real estate investments) and expect a ton of aid based on current income. I'm not saying that's the case for anyone on this thread. I'm just giving an example. I was a pell grant recipient when I went to college. Every year I went to the financial aid office to request more aid. It was humiliating (for me) asking for money, but they always found a couple thousand more. I now donate every year to my alma mater. Good luck!",

A good down jacket of any other brand would be great. Arcteryx is another good brand and The North Face. There is a huge winter sale at the local thrift store in October, if you can get a ride there you can score an amazing $100+ down coat for $20 or less.",

Canada Goose is designed more for style and less for function, which I personally think is the wrong way to prioritize things in Hanover when you\u2019re gonna care more about staying warm than looking fashionable. I\u2019m a big fan of my North Face Arctic Down parka\u2014it\u2019s still pretty pricy, but it\u2019s a fraction of what a Canada Goose costs and works incredibly well.",

            "comment": "they\u2019re very cliche at this point. honestly it\u2019s just a standard black jacket that is no warmer than any other down jacket, the only extra purpose it serves is telling people how much money you have (which in my opinion is a poor reason to buy something, but maybe that\u2019s just me). personally I got by quite well on a $150 north face down jacket I got at like half price on sale. If there\u2019s one major takeaway about hanover winters, it\u2019s layers! Invest in good smartwool base layers and know how to use your mid layers and you\u2019ll be perfectly comfortable in most any jacket that keeps the wind off you!",

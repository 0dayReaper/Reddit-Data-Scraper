Specifically everyone is welcoming/friendly and frat parties are generally open house.\n\nHow true is this really? Have you found it easy to make friends if you get involved with activities? Thanks!",

Houses sometimes have closed events for like them and a house of the other gender, but the real big parties are all open, no cover or anything.\n\nEdit: To add to this, I think people all have the circles that they run in, but for the most part everyone runs in many circles. I had friends from my team, my Greek house, my dorm, classes, and my secret society, some of which overlap, many who didn't.",

As far as frats go, even if you don't participate you're often friends with many affiliated members and might go to parties or a capella concerts in frats, or you might just spend your time elsewhere with any number of other groups based on your interests. Lots of outdoorsy groups, sustainability, concerts, mentorship groups, casual sports, etc.",

Because of the selectivity, it can really help to know someone in the group/activity/club sports team who can pull for you. \nAs for Greek life, yes they are generally open to campus, but the college has a system where the houses have to register the size of the party they\u2019re throwing before hand and can\u2019t exceed that number without risking getting it trouble. Furthermore there is a huge culture of houses pregaming their larger parties with only the brothers/sisters of the house, maybe one or two other houses that have a good relationship with the host house, and then any friends of the brothers. All this means houses will often hit capacity very very quickly because so many people are there before the party officially starts, leading to long lines of people banging on the door trying to get let in.",

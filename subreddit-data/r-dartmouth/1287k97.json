Although I like Brown better in terms of location and curriculum, I want to know more about how being a king scholar makes any difference. Thanks very much in advance for your help!",

Unless I'm misremembering the family, I believe 10+ students would even go and spend holidays with the founding family. I would suggest contacting Jay Davis or the FYSEP program for more information. They would very happily put you in contact with current scholars.",

A lot of the social life is drinking too much beer in basements, and there is a decent hookup culture revolving around that. \n\nIt\u2019s a small college. So it\u2019s not like there\u2019s and endless supply of people for you to date, especially because you would eventually start stepping on the toes of your friends\u2019 romantic partners. Every frat does an event with every sorority at least once a term, and you will meet people from your freshman floor, shmobs, and friends of friends. \n\nAll that being said, Dartmouth must have one of the highest alumni marriage rate out of any school. Probably a third of my friends ended up marrying their college sweethearts, some of whom dated since freshman year.",

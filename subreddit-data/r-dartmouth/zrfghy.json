    "postText": "Hey, an incoming freshman here,  \n\n\nThis question is for current students/alum: How would you advise someone who wants to skip math &amp; econ classes with AP credit? My math is decent and with a little study, I believe that I can recall most of  calculus/micro/macro. Is it worth it to skip the intro courses? Why/ why not? Thank you!!!",

I'm '26 working through all the placement exams this break, they're not too bad and I was able to pass with a little revision.",

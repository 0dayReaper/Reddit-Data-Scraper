I would greatly appreciate it!\n\n I will buy you a coffee as my form of gratitude :)",

Even with someone taking you, you won't get into more places or anything.\n\nI'd start by going into Wilder Hall, where the Physic Department is, and wander the halls there for a bit. Then go cut through into Fairchild where EARS is located. You'll see some classrooms, and research posters. While you're in the atrium of Fairchild (the glass tower), you can check out the pendulum, which is really cool.\n\nThen, head out behind Wilder and check out the Shattuck Observatory. I don't think you'll be able to get in, but during the summer they do star gazing there.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m curious where people would suggest building new dorms at Dartmouth given the housing crunch and latest proposal to build a dorm thirty minutes away from the green. \n\nWhat about moving the president\u2019s house off Webster Ave, expanding the lodge or rebuilding the choates to have more space and nice amenities?\n\nI realize that fixing any of the existing spaces takes away capacity temporarily but really dislike the latest dorm proposal from Dartmouth",

            "comment": "They need to expand/renovate the River and the Choates. But they're so far out of housing that they can't shut down those dorms right now. They really ought to decrease the incoming class size by about 50-100 students, which would relieve a lot of the housing pressure.",

From my research, I\u2019ve seen that Dartmouth MEM grads have much better job placement and salaries. Is that true? \nI\u2019d also like the outdoorsy experience that Dartmouth offers.",

I just interviewed a few weeks ago as well and I\u2019m waiting for my results. \n\nI learnt a lot about their job placements and the lengths that their industry engagement person goes to get offers for their graduates. Plus the ivy name itself helps a lot. Dartmouth for sure.\n\nWould you also mind sharing your experience with the interview and your profile stats? Helps me understand whether I\u2019d stand a good chance or not \ud83d\ude00",

            "comment": "1. BLANKETS!!! Nice, thick, fluffy, preferably weighted blankets. \n2. PILLOWS!!! Something that a lot of my freshmen floor mates forgot to bring. These are important because your bed doesn\u2019t come with a pillow.\n3. Laundry Hamper. Something that most people over look and will end up buying.\n4. Slippers/shoes for showering. Had to give my freshmen roommate an extra pair that I brought with me.\n5. Shower caddy \n6. A fan. For a few weeks in the year it will be very hot, and a fan will be useful especially if you will be living in one of the older dorms.\n7. A bunch of wall hooks in case you want to hang some stuff up, which most people do. \n8. Extensions/Power cords.\n9. Plates and silverware. For the occasions where you don\u2019t want to have to leave your room for food. And trust me these scenarios will arrive plenty. \n10. Storage bins/containers. \n11. Minifridge and Kettle. On the days you don\u2019t want to run to a snack bar or foco for something warm or cold, I would suggest a minifridge and a kettle\n\nAnd finally, this wasn\u2019t really a necessity but I just found it really comforting. ROBES! During the colder months, after a nice warm shower, I would snuggle up in bed in a nice, fluffy, bath robe and watched Netflix with hot coco.",

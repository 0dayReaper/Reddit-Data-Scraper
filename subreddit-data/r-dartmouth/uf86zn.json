Why on Earth would you make any reference to campus drinking culture in your essay when 1) you're most likely under 21 and 2) you probably have many, many more things about Dartmouth or the Hanover location that specifically appeal to you aside from Keggy that you can speak to. Risky topic. Don't do it.",

Bonus points if someone can provide you with a past CHEM 5 final exam, but you can find the topics on the ORC catalogue listing for CHEM 5.\n\nTough to find a standardised exam because the term system means our material is often differently paced from other schools!\n\nDM if you need more help!",

I don't know info off the top of my head but that's something they go over during orientation! You might want to also check out the registrar's office website? They might have more info. Good luck :)",

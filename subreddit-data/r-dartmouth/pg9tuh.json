    "postText": "Hi, incoming 25 here. I took BC junior year of high school and got a 5 on the exam. I ended up not taking a math course my senior year and although I felt that the material in BC was relatively easy, I have not done any math in a year or so and have no experience w/ multivariable calc. Should I just take 9 (and subsequently 13), or is 11 doable for someone who has never taken mv?",

            "comment": "The vast majority of students taking 11 have never taken multivariable calculus before, so you're not at a disadvantage there really. I personally would recommend doing 11 but if you don't feel comfortable with your math skills, 9 and then 13 is a good choice. It also never hurts to have a very strong grasp of the fundamentals, which might be more readily accomplished in two terms than in one.",

            "comment": "I'm basically paraphrasing what the math teachers said at orientation  last year, but contrary to what you'd think, Math 9 is honestly better for math majors/ppl interested in math because you go over proofs/really do a deeper dive on the material, while Math 11 (which I took) is basically just a rush through a bunch of concepts (you do learn them, but oftentimes you don't really learn the \"why\").  So it's not about mv experience.\n\nI didn't have any mv experience... and I didn't do well, but that was a me thing, and most of my friends (who had no mv experience) did well.  Just make sure you want to take the course!  What are you planning on majoring in?",

A lot of the people taking 11 are doing it to get rid of two prereqs in one course (especially useful for engineering and QSS).  That might be something you want to think of for comp sci, which I'm fairly sure requires the math 13 credit at one point.",

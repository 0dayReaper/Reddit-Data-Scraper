They're the biggest major in the school, and the department knows that the major would be devalued if they were handing out A's like candy. So most of the classes have fixed B medians and will be curved to fit the scores to that requirement. The result is that high grades are actually quite difficult to get and the distributions from B through A are really tight.",

I\u2019m a \u201822 bio major, we generally have 2-3 midterms per class that occur every 2-3 weeks throughout the term, and it depends on the class whether the final is cumulative or not. If you put in the work, your grades should reflect that but there\u2019s a reason the avg gpa for people accepted to med school from Dartmouth is so much lower than the national average",

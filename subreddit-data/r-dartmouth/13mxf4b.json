    "postText": "Hi Y'all, \n\nA '27 here starting to think about course selection and enrollment in the fall. I was just curious\u2014from the perspective of past first-years\u2014how competitive the selection into the advanced seminar and writing classes are. I've heard there can be quite a waitlist. I've taken AP Lang and Lit, but I really don't know quite what to expect. I was just curious about everyone else's experience. \n\nThanks!",

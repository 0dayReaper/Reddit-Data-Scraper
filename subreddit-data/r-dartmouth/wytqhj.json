    "postText": "I am a \u201826 and a little confused about groceries and general shopping in the Hanover area. I understand that there is a Co-op in Hanover for basic groceries, but if I wanted to access the Walmart/Home Depot or maybe the fast food in West Leb is there any form of transportation to get me there? Is delivery available in Hanover?",

Idk since I haven't been a student for a little while, but there used to be a zip car on campus available to rent. \n\nAs a '26, though, you'll have a full meal plan for the first term at the very least. There are actually a good variety of food options, especially compared to other schools' offerings. Most people don't grocery shop that much in the beginning. When I was a student, if you had a lot of DBA you could buy things (like a whole carton of almond milk) from Collis. I used to buy a \"salad\" and just loaded my bowl with the veggies I wanted/needed, then took them home to my dorm to use as I pleased. That was my version of grocery shopping sometimes (haha).",

            "comment": "You can take the bus to the stripmall area in West Leb, but then walking from the bus stop to the store that you want to visit is kind of demoralizing because it's just giant parking lots.  One possibility is that the AT buses have bike racks on them.  Biking on the main road down there is a little sketchy, but there are cut throughs between a lot of parking lots so you can get around down there that way.\n\nBut in practice, what most people do is order stuff online to be delivered to campus, if it's something you can't get in town.  That or get a ride with a friend who has a car.",

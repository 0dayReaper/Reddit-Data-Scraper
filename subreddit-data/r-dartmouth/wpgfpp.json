Personally, I\u2019m a writer who can get their thoughts on paper, but I\u2019m rusty on knowing how to do things such as citing, writing a header (including our name, etc..), using powerful vocabulary.  Is writing 2&amp;3 for students who need more support, and is writing 5 for students who need less? Thanks!!",

            "comment": "I took writing 2-3 this past year, though unlike the previous commenter my class was the same but the professor changed. I really made a lot of good friends in the class, i think it fostered a good community through sticking together for two terms, but honestly I regret taking it. I was on the fence at the beginning of last year (like you are now) and I went to my dean who, frankly, did not help me decide. I ended up sticking with 2-3, but the sense i get from talking to all my friends who took writing 5 was that most are equally to less intensive than writing 2-3. Everyone is different and I hesitate to give you advice not knowing your background, but coming from a public school background I thought I wouldn\u2019t be up to snuff with my peers at Dartmouth, but it turned out I would\u2019ve been just fine in writing 5. When it comes to headings, citations, and all that other nitty gritty stuff, you\u2019ll be super comfortable with it by the end of your first term no matter which writing you take. I think writing 2-3 helps far more with organization and planning and I definitely learned some good skills, but I\u2019m not sure in hindsight it was worth spending two terms. that being said, everyone is different and I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll thrive in either! good luck with your decision and with freshman year!",

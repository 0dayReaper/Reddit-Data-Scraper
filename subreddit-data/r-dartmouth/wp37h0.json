            "comment": "Pack less than you think you need. I really regretted half the stuff I purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond or elsewhere before I moved in, and then ended up lugging it all with me everywhere. \n\nBesides clothing and my laptop / school supplies, the things I found most useful during freshman year were:\n\n-\tA portable Bluetooth speaker\n-\tA Nalgene or Hydroflask water bottle \n-\tAn easily portable laundry hamper (I just used one of those foldable mesh and wire ones)\n-\tAn over the door hook for towels\n-\t1-2 under the bed bins for storage (probably could have gone without as a guy but good for storing winter clothes when it\u2019s warm)\n-\tA small shower caddy\n-\t3M Command strips to hang posters\n\nThat\u2019s it. Order everything else as you need it. Things I brought that almost never saw use:\n\n-\tMy Keurig / electric kettle\n-\tMinifridge (nice to have but even better if you can share with a roommate and have them bring it)\n-\tdesk lamp",

(check with your roommate abt this, though\u2026don\u2019t want to trigger any allergies etc)\n\na mirror (some dorms already come with one that was left hanging on the door)\n\ncoat/towel hooks, tote bag/big bag for river outings/long study breaks outside of the dorm/etc, tea+meds+one or two packs of ramen (whatever you need in case you get sick), bug spray!!, portable sanitizer+wipes\n\nhaving separate shower shoes + dorm shoes/slippers than your outdoor ones",

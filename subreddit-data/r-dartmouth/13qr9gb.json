If you're doing five, you're going to be miserable and there's a good chance you don't pass one of them. Just trust that there's a reason for the four-course cap",

I did the biomed engineering major; it basically ends up being many terms of double lab courses (which is similar in workload/time allotment to 4 course terms). It's feasible, but you're going to need to have good outlets, a good plan for each term, and a good support group to get you through",

Even the \"easy\" classes generally require participation and will have significant outside work. And if you're planning on taking anything like engineering or pre-med\u2014or hell, a higher level humanities class\u2014you will be sacrificing sleep and your well-being to work. (Main difference between difficult STEM and difficult Humanities is that, at the end of the day, the English prof isn't going to fail you if you turn in total bullshit papers, but they're going to give you a very hard time and you won't learn anything and you won't like it. I've seen this happen to people.)\n\nI know someone who has taken multiple (I want to say 3?) four course terms. He is a genius. He is also exhausted all the time. I would imagine he has no social life to speak of (without being stereotypical, the fraternity he's in would also imply that). \n\nThree courses is already a lot. My freshman fall I took a three-course term (lab, intro language with drill, and English) and I was never not in the library or in class. And I still got a C+ in my lab and below the median in my language class because I didn't have enough time, ever.\n\nI would at least encourage you to take a three course term your first term here (if you're an admit), ideally with at least one class from your potential major. Try that, see how it suits you, then you can determine whether you're prepared to take multiple four course terms.",

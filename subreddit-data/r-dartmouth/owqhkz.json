Location is close to the library but a bit far from the gym and foco.\n\nThe 2 room double will indeed have 2 rooms. Most people set up the beds so that one is in each room and you have to walk through the \"outer\" room to get into the \"inner\" room. You can also set it up so that both beds are in the inner room and the desks are in the outer room. But yeah bathrooms are single occupancy bathrooms. The building also has a lot of nice study rooms and a snack bar on the first floor which is quite convenient for late night cravings.",

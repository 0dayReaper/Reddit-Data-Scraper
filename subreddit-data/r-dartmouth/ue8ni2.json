In terms of whether Dartmouth skiing is good, yes, it is, although the results can be misleading because the really fast people (e.g., Tommy Ford, before he graduated) are in Europe and so don't show up in College results. Conversely, other schools will recruit athletes off Europa Cup to come to the US, but, yes, it's very good and has been for a century. Maybe you're asking something else.\nSkiway is fun. Nobody will confuse it for Rendezvous Peak, but you can have a great time there.",

I don't know much about the nordic team but I know the Alpine team practices twice a week and has about 5-6 races a season. No experience needed for either but both have members who have competed at high levels before college so there is a wide skill range.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m an alumni interviewer. Every person conducts their interviews differently, but we all fill out the same feedback form to submit to the admissions office. Generally speaking, we\u2019re asked to comment on your academic curiosity, your extracurriculars / leadership skills, why or to what extent you\u2019re interested in Dartmouth, and whether we think you\u2019d thrive as part of the campus community. \n\nBeing able to speak to things you\u2019ve done in HS that address the above certainly helps. We don\u2019t have your resumes or anything about your academic history provided to us, and that\u2019s so that we can be as unbiased as possible. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should memorize responses and repeat them like a robot, or tell us your SAT and AP scores. This is my 7th year doing interviews and I can always tell when someone has a go-to college interview response that they\u2019ve practiced. The best interviews I have are engaged but casual conversations, where we both ask each other plenty of questions and let the topics go wherever we\u2019re both most interested. Showing a strong knowledge of what Dartmouth is like and how it\u2019s unique relative to other schools is always a plus. \n\nGood luck on your application cycle! And remember that the alumni interview bears little to no weight in the decision, so you shouldn\u2019t stress over it. Use it as an opportunity to learn more about the school.",

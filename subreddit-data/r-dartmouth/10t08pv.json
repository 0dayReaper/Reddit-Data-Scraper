He\u2019s got an opportunity to visit a class, and was wondering if anyone knew how many kids might be in American Political System (in 002 Rockefeller) or Microeconomics (in 113 Silsby Hall).  He\u2019d like a somewhat intimate class if possible.  Thanks!",

Most classes beyond the intro courses in Govt are like a cap of 17 students, which is much more the norm for Dartmouth class sizes. If it adds anything, Rocky 002 is one of those concave multi-level half-circle rooms with a couple entrances where he'll probably feel more comfortable watching from one of the back rows yet still being a part of the class. Silsbee rooms are usually pretty small and boxy and can be awkward if you are a few mins late and have to walk in front or etc.",

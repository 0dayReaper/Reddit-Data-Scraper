    "postText": "I took the SAT last week and the ACT today in hopes of finally hitting median. Without knowing the test scores, I\u2019m not sure if I did. As of now, I\u2019m sitting at a 1330 and 29, which are both shy of the median. To my chagrin, I\u2019m not the best test-taker for these things as I overthink too much sometimes.\n\nDartmouth is easily my top choice. There is so much I love about the college from the academics to the sense of community. I would be honored to go there if I got in. (If not, I can handle it, too \ud83d\ude00). \n\nI feel like everything else in my application (GPA, Rank, Extracurriculars, Essays, Recommendations) are/will be very solid. \n\nMy question is: does test optional play that much of a difference if I feel like everything else is on-par?",

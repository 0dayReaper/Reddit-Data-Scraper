Lived in Brown my freshman year and all four are pretty much the same thing. In my experience, the rooms themselves were pretty okay. The single I had was spacious, actually.  \nThe facilities are the issue - laundry situation was abysmal and bathrooms were gross. Bring a fan because there's no AC. There are much nicer dorms on campus, but these aren't the very worst ones either.  \nAnd in terms of location: a little far from central campus. Right next to frat row, and at least a 5-10 minute walk to most other things. Overall, not as bad as the River dorms but a good bonding experience for freshman year.",

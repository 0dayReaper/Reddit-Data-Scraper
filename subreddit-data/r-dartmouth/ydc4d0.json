Unless you have a really good reason or background that prevents you from taking a standardized test, they kind of expect it.",

Dartmouth AOs have stated that they are almost never going to accept someone with SATs below the 25th unless they pull out all the stocks, because it takes many students to pull up the mean scores once you add that student.\n\nDartmouth is actively looking at its peers and seeing how to boost its SAT as high as possible with Test Optional. Schools know that students have access to the SAT, but they\u2019ve changed the discourse from \u201care you able to take the sat\u201d to \u201cdoes the sat best reflect your academic performance?\u201d So now the only way for the SAT to harm you is you submitting a subpar score.\n\nThey won\u2019t assume a base score, because imagine how icky that would get quick: \u201cthis student is black and TO, so we could guess they have a 1200\u201d\u2026yeah, not a thing.",

When you actively do not submit your standardized score, you open holes about your academic history and background. You allow for assumptions to be made, especially when they can easily be avoided. \n\nIt\u2019s very similar to the discussion that I had with Deans when withdrawing from a course freshman year. I had a poor grade that was further in the trenches because of personal issues. When I sought to withdraw, I was told that a W creates a lot more ambiguity and harm than a B or even a C. In other words, I was asked, \u201cWhy let someone assume you did a lot worse than you did?\u201d\n\nMaybe I may be wrong with this entire discussion. However, to me, not submitting a test score is equal to, if not worse, than a low score. Unless you have a very clear reason behind not submitting, or in my case, a withdrawal, it will always hurt you.",

They will acknowledge any gap that you allow them to, so submitting a substandard sat is a bad idea, and, to be frank, if you have a low score, you likely need some type of boost not related to academics to receive an acceptance.\n\nThe only context where I see this being beneficial is if you\u2019re from an under resourced/poor performing school but have a very unusually high sat compared to your peers that\u2019s just below Dartmouth\u2019s 25th. That\u2019s hot shit and will look good, especially for those in underrepresented states. \n\nBut why focus on something like a non-existent SAT when there\u2019s so many other ways to highlight a student\u2019s Ill-fit for Dartmouth (transcript, Course Rigor, essays, community involvement, legacy status, etc)? They only have so much time in admission committees (5-11 minutes usually).",

It involves math and science tho so be prepared but everyone in the class was a non-major so it's not, like, particularly HARD math and science.",

Depending on your situation 1-3 will be foreign language. So you may not have all that many classes toward your major. That said, if you have a pretty clear idea of what you want to major in, you should definitely knock out some of the prereqs (if any) and intro courses in that department.",

(i believe both departments offer plenty of CI, W, and NW as well!)\n\nbasically what that means is you can fulfill a LOT of distribs with things that will also count toward your major. right now you may be thinking of it like, \"ok, a third of my classes are distribs, a third are gov, and a third are econ, so i need to be as precise as possible.\" but that's not really how it works because one class can fill multiple slots. that's SIX distribs you can fill in major. you have more wiggle room than you believe.\n\ni hope that makes sense. i know i threw a lot of dartmouth-speak at you. have fun with it! explore! take classes that look fun and have good profs.",

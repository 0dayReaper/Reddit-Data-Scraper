It's mostly grad students, but my understanding is there are some undergrads living there this upcoming year. I highly discourage anyone from living at Summit due to unethical management. I bring up 3 items:\n\n(1) Summit's lease clearly states no relet fees are to be due in the event of a tenant replacement in section 23.3. Summit is charging an equivalent of one month rent to begin and end a temporary sublet. This is about $3000 and is a breach of contract of their lease.\n\n(2) Summit's lease clearly states they will provide recycling. They are not providing recycling and lied to residents about it. This is a clear breach of contract.\n\n(3) Summit attempted to charge 2 months rent for a security deposit before getting called out on it, which is a violation of NH state law RSA 540-A.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSummit management has refused to discuss any of these issues in good faith.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI highly discourage anyone from living at Summit.",

There is not a ton of room in each of the bedrooms because you have the bed and a wardrobe. As you can see, the shared room is a little bigger. There are two desks in it, and a lot of my friends would rent or buy a futon and set up a TV.\n\nThe big open area on \"French One\" is the common room. Couple of tables, some couches and comfy chairs and a TV.\n\nSee \"French Ground\" for the laundry rooms. Two washers and two dryers in each of the two rooms. Washers always fucking broken lmao. Don't do your laundry on the weekend fam, everyone is always doing laundry on the weekend. \n\nLmao you mistook French for a dorm the college cared about, there is no elevator.\n\nWorst location of a freshman dorm, perennially the greatest people.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m interested in speaking with Dartmouth students about their experiences trying to find housing/rental spaces in the Hanover area in the past few years. This is for a story for the Valley News looking at a newly-proposed rental ordinance in the city along with housing shortages in the Upper Valley. \n\nIf interested, you can either reply here or DM!",

It\u2019s robbery, the new summit on juniper apartments are costly too, my friends are paying $1000 for a small matchbox of a room in a 3B apartment",

Was contacting landlords for weeks to find anywhere to rent when I started looking in spring after losing out in the on-campus apartment lottery.",

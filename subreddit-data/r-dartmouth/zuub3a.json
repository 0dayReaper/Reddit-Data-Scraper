However, \"most winter days between 0 and 10F\" is a stretch.\n\nThe coldest part of the year is late January, with a typical high of 30\u00b0F and a typical low of 12\u00b0F.\n\n[Here's the daily data](https://hprcc.unl.edu/stationtool/explore.php?sid=HANN3&amp;variable=temp&amp;startDate=2021-12-25&amp;endDate=2022-12-24) from the past year (black vertical bars), along with the statistics. The location is the weather station at Shattuck Observatory on campus.\n\nThere can certainly be strings of several days with temperatures that don't get above 10\u00b0F, so that's something to prepare for. The body usually adjusts, though, and it's not unusual to see people out in shorts in 40\u00b0F-degree weather when one of these cold spells ends!",

I live off-campus, in a town that's usually about 5\u00b0 colder than Hanover, and I don't think we've had a single -40\u00b0F day in the last decade.\n\nI would add that in mid-winter the air is quite dry, and there's not much wind because of surrounding hills. So even 15\u00b0F feels a lot warmer than it would in Boston or Chicago.",

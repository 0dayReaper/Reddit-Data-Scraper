    "postText": "I\u2019m going to be visiting Dartmouth tomorrow, but since there are no official tours atm and I don\u2019t know any students, I\u2019m basically going to be wandering around the campus lol. Does anyone have any recommendations on what to be sure to see? I don\u2019t really have any clue what to look at beyond just walking around. Also does anyone know if I\u2019ll be able to go in any buildings? I\u2019m guessing not but idk for sure. Thanks!",

Have lunch at Molly\u2019s. Pop in the Dartmouth Co-Op and Still North Books. \n\nAnd go down to the Boathouse/Ledyard Canoe Club by the river. Could also go up to the BEMA and the Robert Frost statue. Summer session is happening so approach some students and ask your questions. \n\nWeather won\u2019t be the best but welcome to New England.",

One thing visiting tourist like is the Sphinx (secret society) building, seems mysterious to people (kind of like Skull and Bones at Yale). \n\nTuft business school has incredibly gorgeous wood work inside of you can get in. \n\nI second walking the nature trails and up to Frost\u2019s statue. I think it\u2019s kind of moving.",

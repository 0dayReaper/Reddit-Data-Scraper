            "comment": "FOCO is all you can eat once you swipe in. Hop, Collis, Novack, and Ramekin are pay per item (with DBA aka Dining Dollars for us students of course). \n\nI would say in rankings of food, the Hop is the best, followed by Collis and FOCO kinda tied (it depends on what they have on a given day), then Novack, then Ramekin. \n\nThe food is fine. I've been to tons of colleges where the food is straight up inedible. You will not starve here. We also have tons of accommodations, especially in FOCO, for people w/ dietary restrictions. The FOCO vegetarian options are better than most colleges'. The FOCO stir fry, general tso's tofu, most pastas, bagels... \\*chef's kiss\\* And everything at the Hop slaps. Collis smoothies are really good.\n\nMy main gripe is the meal plans. They are crazy overpriced and you can't opt out in most circumstances unless you live off campus. You might be shocked to learn at Collis a peanut butter &amp; jelly sandwich is $4.50, but considering how much DBA and how many swipes they give you, the \"overpriced\" sandwich makes sense. In a way, DBA and swipes are inflated against actual USD, such that you pay $2k a term for food. It's kind of silly. I use the 80 block meal plan (cheapest one) and it's perfect. Once I live off campus I'll save even more money because, y'know, in the real world PB&amp;J isn't $4.50.",

It's not $4.50 USD but $4.50 \"Dining Dollars.\"\n\nI would say students w/ a meal plan eat at FOCO at least once a day but IDK for sure. Personally I'm a snacker so I'm fine w/ the upcharged grab-n-go food prices because, again, it's fake money haha. Like with the 80 block meal plan, I have like $600 or $800 (can't remember which) dining dollars to spend in ten weeks, as well as 80 swipes. \n\nThe Hop is super popular -- that's actually the main issue. There's always a long line. Little KAF had the same problem before it went out of business, rest in peace. FOCO is the most convenient and there's the most options.\n\nAre you an incoming '25? I'm happy to answer other questions you have if you DM me! The college puts you on the \"Ivy League Meal Plan\" for your first term, which is \"unlimited\" meal swipes and like $200 DBA. The way it works is kinda complex but it'll be explained to you 500 times when you get on campus.",

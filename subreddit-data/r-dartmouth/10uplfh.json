    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm an 2027 early decision applicant to Dartmouth and got deferred in December. \n\nI have some important updates on my personal statement and activities that I really want to tell the AOs. I submitted my updated personal statement on 1/7 both through the portal and through email, and it appeared as \"Post decision material\" on my portal after like 4 days. I then submitted my updates on activities on 1/24 only through my portal. And it doesn't seem to appear on my application checklist.\n\nSo would the materials uploaded through the portal appear in the checklist? I'm not sure whether to send the document again through email or not because I know they wouldn't want duplicates of materials.\n\nThanks a lot! :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7bmiyl45gga1.png?width=1466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9ef238c698d3e3b00d8777b58c3697252d9060ee",

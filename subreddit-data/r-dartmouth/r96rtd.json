I went on College Confidential prior to the release of decisions by the College to see if this happened to other people, and everyone who I had observed reporting this was ultimately  accepted. Do not take my reply as a guarantee for acceptance, but I've yet to see an exception to this rule. Best of luck!!",

The date changed to 12/3 on my application portal at first and then they requested  more docs the day before decisions came out and it changed to 12/15. At this point, if they are requesting documents from you, it is most likely because they accepted you and are scrambling to put together a financial aid package in time for decisions when they come out. Again, I cannot guarantee anything, but Dartmouth is a need blind institution for domestic students (I'm assuming you are) and therefore, they would not have a need to process financial aid materials if you had not been accepted.",

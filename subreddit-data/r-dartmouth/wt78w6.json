Can I go to Dartmouth for freshman year all first 3 quarters and from that summer until at least the next spring term (3 quarters) come back and continue my internship?",

I\u2019d argue college is just as much, if not more, about the experience and the bonds you create with your fellow students than your classes. \n\nPlus, in the working world, a year-long internship doesn\u2019t give you too much of a boost, if any, compared with regular summer internships. I wouldn\u2019t recommend sacrificing your college experience for a marginal boost to your resume.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that you\u2019d be swapping a year of employment (right after graduation) for a year of internship instead. Just something to consider.",

Also, the deadline for the final transcript is June 30 but I won't get my final transcript until like towards the end of July. What should my counselor send in this case? (intl student)",

Idk honestly about the APs since I took none (intl student) but if it's not on your enrollment checklist then u prolly don't have to worry. But u can always email the admission office and ask them just to make sure.",

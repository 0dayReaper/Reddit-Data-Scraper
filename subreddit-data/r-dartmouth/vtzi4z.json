I know more non-premeds in this major than premeds. \n\nThe overlap works nice if you\u2019d like to be premed but have an interest in engineering, but that is still quite a lot of work due to engineering courses and premed courses both being the hardest at Dartmouth",

            "comment": "By design it is, but a fair number of non-premeds take it. The normal engineering track doesn't require organic chem, biochem, and some of the bio courses. That said, the premed prereqs, especially the bio courses, will give you a really good foundation for BME. There's nothing that stops you from taking the engineering sciences track and specializing in BME, with you filling in any courses you need, like CHEM 6, for a biomaterials concentration. The normal engineering track would leave you a little more time for extra engineering courses instead of the premed stuff. It just depends what you want to go through!",

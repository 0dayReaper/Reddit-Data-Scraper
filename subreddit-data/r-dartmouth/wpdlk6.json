    "postText": "Will depositing a sum of money into my GET account before receiving my ID mean that, the moment I get my ID from Dart, I can begin using it to buy snacks? I\u2019m asking this because I\u2019m a \u201826, and I still have to wait to get my ID, but I want to deposit funds into GET. Would it be smarter to wait until I get my ID and then deposit funds. Is there no difference? Thanks for the info; you\u2019re all very supportive:)",

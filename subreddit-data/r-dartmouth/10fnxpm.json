For some classes it really really sucks because you fit a whole semesters worth of content into 10 weeks. 3-4 classes though are really nice and some classes can be really niche and interesting because they don't have to have all that much content. The D plan as a whole also means you won't always see your friends for several terms because of being abroad or off terms or something. It's a mixed bag. Maybe it would work better for you however for most people it's a wash",

Additionally, are the odds that I get most of the classes I need when I need them decent since Dartmouth is a small school? Has anyone had any luck transferring summer credits from a local four year to Dartmouth? I\u2019m making a four year plan to figure out the logistics of graduating with a BE in four years.",

With proactive planning and maybe 1 or 2 4 course terms, you\u2019d be able to do it in 4 years no problem",

I\u2019ve helped a lot of people with BE plans and have deliberated over mine a lot as well, and usually when people come in well placed like yourself, it\u2019s not a huge struggle to do the BE in four years. What kind of concentration are you thinking about? I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s some misunderstanding on your part that\u2019s not allowing you to construct your plan efficiently.",

A friend of mine did transfer a Stanford summer course, but not sure if it was science related or not.  My feeling is that you have to check with your Department Advisor and from experience, they tend to be flexible and very student centric.\n\n  \nIf debt is your primary concern for 4 years or 5 years and you really want to do the BE, there may be fellowships/scholarships for the BE Year.  I vaguely recall a friend getting one, but not 100% sure. \n\nI had a very small amount of financial aid, but remember getting some small academic / merit stipend my Sophomore year.  The other thing to mention is that many of the Dartmouth internships pay really well -- $7K-$10K/per month in software tech and finance.  That was a nice help and i ended up doing some part-time work for one of my summer employers during my Dartmouth terms. \n\nI valued the options and paths at Dartmouth.  Good luck!",

IDK how the BE works, but if it's five years of courses normally, and you want to do the BE in four years, it's probably better to take all four terms on (fall winter spring summer) all four years. I don't know if people do that, though... it's designed to be a five year program, maybe it's better to do that.",

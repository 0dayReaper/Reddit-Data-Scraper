            "comment": "one thing about dartmouth that i underestimated was how central greek life is to a majority of students here. this is largely because of the lack of other nightlife/amenities existing beyond dartmouth itself in hanover/nearby area. for background, i'm a freshman, but i'm just not into drinking/partying. \n\nmy advice is to seek out other individuals and friends who share similar values and interests. you can do this in more chill settings from going out to lunches, going on walks, or attending collis/club events which can be pretty fun! don't ever feel compelled to do something you don't want to do if your heart isn't into it and if it's something you're not comfortable with in the first place. the community you strive for is here...just takes time to figure out and find the right group of people.\n\nplus, there's always more to life than just frat parties. sometimes just asking people if they'd be down for something like a pizza party or a night-in can do wonders in developing intimate friendships and finding a group of friends that relate to you...having a supportive group of like-minded friends will be especially helpful to you since there's not much on campus aside from the school itself.",

            "comment": "i hate greek life. i think it's the worst thing about dartmouth, lol. i felt less strongly when i came in, but knew i wouldn't rush.\n\nthe best thing you can do is build a group of friends who also aren't big into greek life. DOC people often fit the bill. people also build really great communities around club and IM sports. i am not a sports person, but i really pushed myself out of my comfort zone. i asked people out to lunches when i wanted to know them better, i threw \"dinner parties\" (read: domino's pizza and beer), and i offered favors to people as much as i could. i have a great group of friends now, especially because i'm VERY involved in my relatively small department. i also befriended grad students. \n\nso it's possible, absolutely, to make friends and have a great time at dartmouth without going through greek life. but it does require more work. you need to be ok, especially in the beginning, with getting out of your comfort zone, building a pattern through which to make friends. i saw it kind of like dating. 1) ask out to lunch 2) invite to watch something or study together 3) if you like them, ask what they're up to on friday nights. you can honestly get a good thing going just by studying with the same people over and over. there are concerts here, there are sunny days where you can sit on the green and just talk. but you will have to put effort in.\n\n\"just ask people to hang out!\" is such trite advice, but that's what my socially inept self did. if they demurred or seemed busy, i gave up and tried someone else i thought was cool. everyone's lonelier than they seem in college.",

One of the things I\u2019m looking forward to most abt college is being involved in things, and I\u2019m at a pretty big high school that has a bunch of idiots rn and am managing with my group of people I\u2019m friendly with. \n\nig a question I still have is do parties divide the campus? like does the party culture destroy campus unity?",

It sucked back then and after the last 2 years, The Admin had further shutdown everything that made Dartmouth barely enjoyable outside or Greek.\nBest I can tell you is you might grow to enjoy it and even participate (I did, but now kinda grew crusty).",

I personally enjoyed my time here but as a freshman it would be pretty tough because all the kids just party because they think thats what College Kids should do. It will absolutely suck for the first few terms but then when everyone mature up a bit, it will be a great College experience.\n\nMy only advice : Have some reliable friends and you will  generally be having a good time.",

I mentioned names of profs and very specific programs that I can\u2019t find anywhere else. All the info can be found on their website if you dive deep enough. \n\nFor the \u201cintroduce yourself\u201d essay, get creative with it! \n\nThere\u2019s a third essay, but you have options for the prompt you want to choose. I\u2019d say choose the one where you are able to tell AO\u2019s the best story of yourself. \n\nAnd since your interests abre about eduction, social impact, and writing, you could talk about so if programs that Dartmouth offers which would align with your interests+plus how a Dartmouth education would allow you to expand on those interests in the future. \n\nLastly, make sure that whoever is writing your peer rec knows you very well so that they can show AO\u2019s your non-academic and academic side. \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "There\u2019s a garage in Hanover that\u2019s underground at 7 Lebanon St. It is run by the town and you can pay for monthly parking, but it is quite expensive. \n\nYou don\u2019t really need a car in Hanover your freshman year. I had one sophomore year on, and honestly it\u2019s often more of a pain (esp in winter) than it\u2019s worth. You\u2019re mostly going to be on campus. Rides are provided to nearly any location you\u2019d want to go to. The Dartmouth Coach can take you to NYC/Boston. And if you really want to get somewhere, odds are good you can find someone with a car to lend or drive you there.\n\nEdit: and don\u2019t listen to whoever says you can park at CVS or the restaurants. Those lots aren\u2019t long term parking and you will be towed.",

            "comment": "You could probably find somebody in Hanover, Norwich or West Lebanon who would rent you a parking space at their home or business, maybe even in a garage.  There's a row of dilapidated garages on the west side of West St. right near campus (look for the long building right nest to the street on google maps and try a street view and you'll see what I mean).  I imagine those are rented to students, but I've never looked into who owns them.  You could sleuth that out on the town GIS website.  If you were willing to park a mile, or two or ten away, it might get cheaper really fast.  One resource is the [upper valley listserv](https://lists.vitalcommunities.org/lists/info/uppervalley) email mailing list--you could put out a query there, for anyone willing to rent you a space within X distance from campus.  Maybe you'd even find somebody who would provide shuttle service to their parking lot.\n\nBut I agree with others that you don't need a car.",

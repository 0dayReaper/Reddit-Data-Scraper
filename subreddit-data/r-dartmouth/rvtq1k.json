    "postText": "Hello Folks,\n\nI'll be applying to the MEM program (Thayer School of Engineering) for Fall '22. I've been doing my research on why Dartmouth specifically. \n\nA few points I was able to gather (other than the usual reasons regarding courses and curriculum)\n\n1) Very friendly and empathic folk. Tight-knit alumni network.\n\n2) The campus is tucked away from the city. Natural beauty &amp; outdoor activities to unwind.\n\n3) Flexibility of the program.\n\nIt would be great if you can share your experiences on why you were happy you chose Dartmouth. Sorry if it's not the right sub but since MEM gives us a chance to take 2 courses from Tuck, thought I'd post it here!\n\nThanks in advance! :)",

For me it's a plus.\n\nAs a side note, that might ruffle some feathers, the students in the MEM program are generally  academically  stronger than the Tuck students.  At least about 70% of the MEM students.",

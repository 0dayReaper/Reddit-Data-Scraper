    "postText": "Hi internet, \n\nI'm a 35F, married to a 35M, and parents of 3 wonderful pups (2 pitbulls and a german shepard mix). I work in a research lab in Pittsburgh (I'm a postdoc) and my boss announced yesterday that she's moving to Dartmouth next year. \n\nIn Pittsburgh we own our house (with a yard) in a very walkable neighborhood, I bike to work (4 miles) most days, take public transit (many bus options), or run to work. We barely use our car, maybe to go to Costco once in a while but we do most of our groceries biking. Most of my hobbies are related to outdoor activities, but I have always done those in the context of a city and have never lived in a place smaller than 200k habitants. The cost of living is pretty cheap in Pittsburgh and we are able to save money and pay student loans. Our mortgage is ridiculously cheap (&lt;$800 per month for our 3 bedroom 1.5 bathroom).\n\nMy question is: am I going to be able to have a lifestyle that remotely resembles my current lifestyle? Do people bike commute? My boss was saying that most people don't live in Hanover itself because is too expensive but that road cycling was big. She also mentioned some sort of public transit. Is it reliable? Am I going to be able to find a place for rent (we don't want to buy another house bc we wouldn't be in Dartmouth for more than a couple of years) that has a fenced yard and would take 3 dogs?\n\nThank you so much! We will come to visit next month.",

            "comment": "You can definitely rent, but, given the lack of affordable housing in the Upper Valley, it may very well be more expensive than what you're currently paying in Pittsburgh, but probably not outlandish. I'd recommend living in Lebanon, White River Junction, or West Lebanon if you're worried about costs--these neighboring towns can be less expensive and are very close to Dartmouth. These towns and the others that surround the Dartmouth campus, namely: Norwich, Hanover, and Lyme (these three are more expensive side), all have plenty of green spaces, walking trails, and forests. The best advice I can give you is to check out the listings for housing on Dartlist (website link: https://sites.dartmouth.edu/dartlist/category/housing/) and to get started on applying for housing and emailing people EARLY because there is a lack of housing. As a postdoc, you could also look into living in Dartmouth housing, but it's generally not as nice as private real-estate. \n\nBiking and outdoorsy activities are big here--if you don't live too far from campus, you can definitely bike most places and most non-interstate highway roads that connect the towns have big bike lanes. In short, people do bike a lot. I wouldn't count on the public bus transport. It is free and there are multiple bus lines that go to different places, but I think service is inconsistent and doesn't run past 5pm and only starts at 9am. Most things are within a 10-20 minute drive of all the Upper Valley towns--grocery stores, gas stations, hospital, etc., and a lot of people drive short distances, but not long ones. You may drive more in the winter when the cold and snow prevents people from biking. In short, it is unlikely that you will need to use your car to drive long distances very often, as it is usually only a short drive to get basic things like groceries or medical care. West Lebanon has everything from gas stations, target, post office, multiple supermarkets to a giant LL Bean all within one stretch, and all the towns have individual stores that provide necessities and locally made goodies. You'll find everything you need nearby. \n\nAlso, there are many trail systems, hikes, public parks, and forested areas that you can use all located within Hanover, Lebanon, Lyme, and Norwich. If you venture beyond that, the hiking and skiing options are plentiful. Even if you can't find a house with a yard, you're pretty much guaranteed to have nature pretty close by because this area is basically, by definition, the woods. I also must say that because the area is relatively rural that there are a lot of farms nearby where REALLY INCREDIBLE fresh produce, dairy, and meat can be purchased and the Norwich Farmers market is fantastic and held year-round. \n\nI love the Upper Valley! I think you will too! I hope you enjoy your visit. If you can, get a bahn mi sandwich from Phnom Penh Sandwich Station when you visit! They're delicious! Also, if you can, check out Kind Arthur Baking Company in Norwich (right across the river from Hanover)--there is no shortage of good bread and amazingly delicious baked goods in the Upper Valley because of King Arthur. You can also taking baking classes there.",

I love the idea of taking baking classes. \n\nWhen you say bike lanes in the non-interstate highways, do you mean shoulders or bike lanes with proper signage and/or separated from traffic?\n\nFor driving, I'm assuming winter tires are required? \n\nFresh produce sounds really good too.",

The buses also go to NYC from Hanover. Both Boston bound and NYC bound buses usually leave hourly. If you need to catch a plane out of Boston or are craving a city, that bus makes it easy. It's a civilized bus ride. Comfy seats and quiet.",

A lot of science labs are located at the hospital, but not all of them. The hospital is in Lebanon. The main campus is in Hanover. It would be best for you to find this out before you decide where to live and where you'll have to bike to and from.\n\nMy advice is just prepare yourself for having to drive more than you do currently. Please note that it will not be long distances and there is relatively little traffic. People are saying rush hour exists here, but seriously, rush hour up here is absolutely nothing compared to rush hour in urban areas. You might be stopped for like 5 extra minutes on your way home because of a long line of cars at a light. Not like 2 hours. That said, urban areas allow for alternatives to get around, but the Hanover area depends a lot more on car culture. I think you will have to drive more even if you can bike most places.",

If you're in NH you're not paying income tax so of course you're paying higher property taxes. You seem to just want to focus on the downside of each without acknowledging that it is offset. There is a bike route that goes from Hanover down through Lebanon, crosses the bridge at WRJ and circles back up to Norwich that is very safe and nice. I ride it constantly. I can't speak to the other areas. But I also wrote in my original post that of course OP will need a car to get around, and biking here is mostly recreational.",

I read this board because I do hire a lot of Dartmouth graduates at a local tech company so I like hearing what's going on.\n\nI moved here for work and knew no one and came all of the way from San Francisco. No car, little savings, just enough to buy a crappy car and do first and last rent on a place.\n\nMost things are already answered but something to keep in mind here is you're 1 hour from anywhere...2 hours from anywhere you'd like to go. If you haven't spent a week in Vermont, you should just to get a feel for it. It's quaint, average age is in the 50s, people are simpler here and if you don't Know someone and aren't in the Dartmouth world, it's very hard to make friends. The Hanover area can be super transient. If you do meet someone who isn't from here, you blink and they've moved back to where they came from. They come for the hospital or college. The locals keep to themselves and don't step foot in Hanover and have their own 'local yokel' vibe which I've embraced but I've been here for 11 years.\n\nYou'll eat at the same 10 places, you'll shop at 2 grocery stores, you'll learn or embrace watching movies, cooking, gardening, brewing beer and having hobbies that really involve your time @ home. the IMAX theatre is in Boston 2 hours away. The apple store is 1.5 hours away. Hanover just got a Starbucks in the last 6 years. So if you're okay with losing convenience and just being able to have any kind of food you want, you'll have a tough time up here.\n\nSounds like you like the outdoors and wide open spaces, it's good you're already married and if you can get by with how little there is to do compared to a city, it is a great place to live. I'm about to buy and renovate an old 1850s farmhouse and I brew beer, enjoy photography, camp out of my tent and off my motorcycle about 40 days out of the year and I travel a lot because living here I save enough money to travel a lot. It's been super funny to me because before the pandemic everyone I knew in SF told me I'd be back and I can't find work here and remote work is not a thing. Now all of my neighbors are Amazon-Bros from Boston &amp; NY who are moving up here to work remotely and asking me how to use a snow blower. I don't feel like a local but it is funny how many tech people I see leaving the cities. It's not like I feel vindicated but I am happy to have bought my place for a hundred grand 6 years ago before the housing crunch hit.",

This is a rural area and New Englanders are known for being reserved anyways (a stereotype that I find true, but there are exceptions.) Don't take it personally, people keep to themselves. That said, I feel like I've made some really solid friends here that I can count on for pretty much anything--people come out of the wood-work once you break the ice. Put in the effort and you will be rewarded. If you're affiliated with Dartmouth, that will make meeting people much easier because you'll be a part of a community to begin with. However, just keep in mind that, like when you move to any new place, forging connections and making friends will take time.\n\nAlso, as a woman, I have never felt in danger going and hiking on the AT or walking/running on dirt roads on my own. It's really safe here. Incidents involving wildlife don't really happen. Just be sure to wear an orange vest in the woods during hunting season and get yourself some decent hiking boots so that you can get outdoors. If you want company on a hike or outdoorsy excursion, I guarantee there will be a ton of people that would take you up on an offer to go on a day-hike in a second. It's also a good way to make friends. The nature up here is incredible. I encourage you to embrace it.\n\nYes, you might go to the same set of supermarkets and restaurants. That said, you'll be able to find most everything that you need food and staple wise at the supermarkets here. Also, I really find that fresh and delicious food is really abundant and close by in a way that it isn't in urban areas. For example, I'll be driving in Lyme and pick up eggs, milk, cheese, and meat at the literal farms where they're produced. In the summer, that extends to tons of produce.",

I am never in situations where I go to the woods by myself.\n\nI am a little afraid of isolation and not seeing many people around. I feel safer by the idea that if I go running or biking I'll likely see other humans. Embarrassingly, I am terrified of bears.

There are many nice towns with affordable housing. Claremont and Queche come to mind. But 30-40 min commute time will be needed. \n\nThe coop in Hanover is great.",

            "comment": "I did my PhD at Dartmouth and then post-doc at U Chicago. We moved back to the area because it is honestly amazing. The cycling is awesome and I bike commute year round. You'll want studs in the winter though. If you live over in Lebanon and your lab is at the hospital, you might even be able to mountain bike commute. I live in Lebanon and take a long commute about 8 months out of the year and can even hit dirt roads with views on the way if i want. The road cycling is world class, but the gravel riding is seriously probably some of the best in the world. There are dirt roads that go seemingly forever and the only cars that pass you are generally not dicks and are only on those roads because they live there. Also look up Greens woodlands, there is free groomed cross country skiing and pro-built mountain bike trails. It's about a 25 to 30 minute drive away from Hanover / Leb though, but worth it. I think having at least one car to do stuff like this makes sense here. \n\nThe public transit only runs during the week, sadly. But at least it is free and reliable. My partner and I share a car and that has worked out well. One of us will bike and the other drives, or works from home as of recently. \n\nAs for renting, take a look in Lebanon since it's quite a bit cheaper. The ride from Lebanon to Hanover isn't that bad, there is a hill right in the middle though. So you're going to be going over that, it's a pretty nice ride though with either bike lanes or cycle tracks most the entire way. I can give you which routes are the best to take if you need them.",

I just don't like depending on a car for my every day routine but I like the idea of using it occasionally, so we would def drive and explore around during weekends. Do you feel like there are others that bike commute too (seeing bikes during your commute or parked bikes on racks)?\n\nI would love to get some of your routes! I'll PM you early next year once we book our tickets.",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re looking for some semblance of a walking community you\u2019d want to look at downtown Lebanon, Hanover, Norwich, or White River Junction. Prices will vary and may be a shock when you start researching.\n\nRental may be hard to find, but not impossible. Dartlist, Craigslist, Housing Solutions, Dartmouth Real Estate office could all be resources. Also, each town has their own \u2018Listserv\u2019 that you could advertise your housing needs and maybe get lucky.\n\nThere is some public transportation, which is reliable and free. However, you\u2019d want to research your travel needs deeply and try to plant yourself along the right route. You don\u2019t want to be switching lines because the buses just aren\u2019t frequent enough for that to be efficient.\n\nPlenty of people bike to work. Some even fat bike in the winter. The recreational biking is amazing. Lots of great MTB trails, and hilly but scenic road or gravel biking options.\n\nOverall cost of living will be higher. But if you live in NH you can avoid state income tax and sales tax. Food prices are probably going to be higher than what you\u2019re used to. Housing prices will definitely be higher regardless of if you rent or own. Don\u2019t forget to budget in money for heat. That can vary widely depending on how efficient your home is. Well insulated homes can have a heating bill half of older construction.\n\nThere is access to green space everywhere. Some will have a little transit involved but if you plan well or get lucky, you could easily have options right outside your door.",

I was checking Google Maps and the roads look kind of scary IMO. Speed limits are high (I get it for a rural ish area) and I generally don't feel too safe when biking in these type of roads. I guess I might need to get used to!\n\nThanks for your help!",

    "postText": "Hello. I am an aspiring undergraduate actress from Central Asia who plans to apply to Dartmouth. I know that as of now the University\u2019s acceptance rate is 6%. From one website I saw that there are about 8 people each year who finish their bachelor\u2019s degree, which means they are probably accepting the same amount of people each year. Does anyone what is the acceptance rate when it comes to theater majors there? And if u studied/study theater at Dartmouth, what were your experience/achievements when u applied? Generally what would u want to warn/share with people who plan the same?",

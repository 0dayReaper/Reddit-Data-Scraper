    "postText": "Question: in any of your political science, philosophy, or theory courses in general, is there any substantive debate?\n\nI'm trying to get a pulse on the academic culture, as to whether not certain schools have a ethos/practice of encouraging and engaging in meaningful debate, independent thought, and critical  inquiry.\n\nOr, do you mostly just sit there and listen?\n\nAsking for me. Terrified of transferring to another mind numbing school unless I'm getting some benefit out of it like living in Miami at the beach. Also I'm just very curious because one of my professors just came from an Ivy and seems to be oblivious to some factors in his classroom that infantilize students and seem to hold the classroom to a low standard for discourse. Any input is really appreciated. Cross-posting.",

Some of the best discussions I've had took place in GOV classes on political theory, and two profs that really stand out are James Bernard Murphy and Bernard Avishai. Michelle Clarke is great, too, and I've heard great things about Russ Muirhead. Henry Clark, who runs the PEP project, has some interesting stuff going on, and I was a PEP fellow during the year I took to apply to grad school. Happy to talk about more\u2014just drop me a message.",

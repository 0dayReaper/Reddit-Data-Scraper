    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm a new employee but different from most in that I'm actually a college student myself and only 21 years old. I have a few general questions though if you guys wouldn't mind answering.\n\nThe job I have gives me housing near the Co-Op but it's pretty shitty (1993 appliances) with no AC and I share the house and bathrooms with 2 30 year olds. I've looked at Dartmouth Upper Valley list plus every website I can and there is NO housing up here. I'm even willing to go up to 50% of my income and still couldn't find anything. Is that just a thing here where housing is pretty much a crapshoot? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso since I'm 21, I'm still very much interested in meeting people my age but from what I can tell a lot of social life here is greek life based and/or restricted to students (Kyle concert, intramural sports, barbecue I was denied at, etc.). How can a 21 year old non-student meet people here? \n\nI also had a question about the AT bus. I have been given a parking spot in Dewey lot but that means a long walk to my office which limits the time I have for lunch. I believe that bus runs from Dewey lot to the Thompson lot (athletic fields) semi-regularly so is that an option or do I just need to get in shape and walk the mile or so?",

Nowhere to rent and the majority of undergrad dorms are even worse than what you described. So no real way around that. \n\nAs for a social life, I would recommend walking around campus, the gym, etc. can I ask what you\u2019re doing?",

            "comment": "The housing crisis is very real in the Upper Valley, especially if you want to live in Hanover. Even some professionals who work full-time for the college have to pay half their income for housing! If you talk to the food service employees here, you\u2019ll find out that many of them have to commute as far as one hour each way. Restaurants often have to turn down customers for lack of workers.\n\nSo you\u2019re actually pretty lucky to have Hanover housing provided to you.\n\nAs for social life: there\u2019s one bar in town (Dunk\u2019s) and it\u2019s usually pretty packed on a Friday or Saturday night. Might be a place to meet both students and non-students.",

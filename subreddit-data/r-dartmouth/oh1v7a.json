I'm also fairly certain that you can't remove the college supplied furniture. You can totally get some cute decorations to dress up the space, though!",

I had a shelving unit from another company for my five years there that was invaluable.  You can do some sweet stuff with Ikea's cube storage pieces (e.g. eket).  Only thing to be aware of is that you can end up moving in and out a lot because of the D plan and you want your stuff to be easily carry-able on stairs (i.e. not heavy and big)",

    "postText": "I recently visited Dartmouth for the first time for a friend\u2019s graduation for 2 days. I am from DC area. Me and my friends here grew up in South Asia. I felt a general vibe of unfriendliness towards me! Little incidences here and there made me feel as if I wasn\u2019t welcome. This isn\u2019t my observation in Hanover alone but also in neighboring towns. I have lived in the country for 8 years and have never felt this way before. \n\nIs this because of some cultural difference I am not aware of perhaps? Have other people observed this? Or perhaps I made a mistake or visited for too short a time. If I made a mistake in my observation I would like to get it corrected. Thanks.",

As I stood there thinking about what to do, my neighbors showed up (without being asked!) with snow shovels and helped dig me out. We didnt' talk much while we shoveled, and then they left, as quietly as they had come. New England is like that. Very little superficial stuff, but people go to great lengths to help others - even strangers - when they are in need.",

Parents who just spent hundreds of thousands of dollars for their child\u2019s education and they forget that Dartmouth, and the surrounding community, both exist outside of each other. In Hanover, you will witness hundreds of cars in places designated \u201cno parking\u201d, or worse, in someone else\u2019s permitted parking spot, or blocking driveways. The town tries to help, but they don\u2019t have the resources to accommodate an enormous one weekend event. Dartmouth does put in effort, but they fall short of \u2018going the extra mile\u2019 by not having a foolproof solution.\n\nJust because graduation is a big event up here does not mean the rest of the community has to accommodate it. Some businesses flourish during the big events, and others are marred by it, with their most important clientele avoiding going out this weekend because of the onslaught of graduation traffic.\n\nI mention this because yes, if you\u2019re here with out of state license plates and so much as park outside the painted lines of a designated parking spot you\u2019re going to get a collective groan from the community that lives here the rest of the year.",

It may be just that southern culture is usually overly polite and I have grown to love it/think of it as usual culture. \n\nMy experiences can pass off as one offs or random perhaps. They were not overly rude but several of them together could make one uncomfortable. \n\nFor example, I sat in a shuttle on campus where parents and students started filling in after me. No one sat next to me while the bus was full. Mine was the only empty seat with people standing. It is hard to not put the fact here that I was the only non white person there. There were several people who could have sat next to me/ were single travelers. I think I was polite in all ways I can think of! \n\nA general observation regarding whether people smiled or not/ whether they were willing to talk to me if I asked a question/ requested a service/ asked for help. It is hard to pinpoint in these cases but I felt a bit unwelcome. Of course I only stayed for 2 days so my data points are highly limited. \n\nI have travelled quite well in the US and have visited cities in most of the states in the US. But this was perhaps my only negative (perhaps not so much) experience so far. So I decided to get my views corrected if I made a mistake.",

I'm sorry that you felt the area was unfriendly. Hanover and nearby towns (including White River Junction and Lebanon) in my experience are very friendly. There is not a lot of ethnic diversity, but there is definitely some and the overall vibe is welcome to diversity (a visitor from Rhode Island recently commented on the many Black Lives Matter signs). Outside of Hanover and nearby towns, it gets pretty rural so you might run into an unfriendly redneck or two, but I would say that would be an isolated incident because tourism is important to the region and most people are generally friendly. \n\nI'm struggling to come up with an explanation for your experience. I have previously lived in Texas and Oklahoma and I wouldn't be at all surprised if you experienced unfriendliness in some areas of those states, but not here. Sorry for your experience and sorry I can't better explain.",

            "comment": "Southerners have a ton of \"politeness\" which is actually feigned. New Englanders are less fake polite; we just don't say as much. When you come from a society that places a ton of emphasis on decorum and courtesy (which, do not get me wrong, can be worthy values in many contexts), this comes across as rude, but it's not intended to be \u2014\u00a0it's just that people don't say more than they need to.\n\nThe way I often think about it: When I go to the South, I find everyone almost seems to be doing an act \u2014\u00a0they're very *nice*, but it doesn't always seem that they're as kind. New England culture values kindness (doing good deeds) but doesn't place much value at all on saying exactly the right thing at the right time. It's just seen as unnecessary to dress things up; you live your life, your neighbor lives their life, and if they need help, you do what you can for them, even if you barely speak when you pass each other in the street.\n\nThis all comes back to the Puritan culture of the early New England colonists \u2014\u00a0as opposed to the more courtly culture brought by the emigres from Britain that initially went south \u2014\u00a0and also to de Tocquevilleian ideals of \"self-interest rightly understood\" and whatnot.\n\nSo basically: People have preferences (often just where they're from) for what's \"right,\" but ultimately it's cultural difference, and manners are different elsewhere. If you were always living with a Southern-style sense of politeness in a small New England town, folks would probably think you were far too social/talkative and find you a bit weird/annoying.",

I live in New York now and sometimes find New Yorkers rude relative to New Englanders (the former will, for instance, yell \"get out of my way\"; the latter probably not say anything at all, or will simply brush past and mutter an \"excuse me,\" and then a Southerner might do something like \"oh pardon me, so sorry\" sort of deal). \n\nBut ultimately I don't think folks from any part of the country are better or worse people, just the norms around expressing oneself are markedly distinct.",

I have been trying to find out where I should live to work at the medical center. Lebanon? West Lebanon? Hanover, White River Junction? Norwich?\n\nPlease please please give this midwesterner some local experience for what to expect and where to live!\n\nAny thoughts? Thanks so much. ( I have cross posted this to several other relevant subs. Apologies if you're seeing duplicates!)",

            "comment": "Finding reasonably priced (&lt;$1500/mo) housing in the area can be difficult to find especially if you intend to live on your own. Keep an eye on Dartlist (sites.dartmouth.edu/dartlist) and the Dartmouth Real Estate Office. With Dartlist, locals post available units there and sometimes people in search of roommates will post, too.\n\nThere are also several apartment complexes in the immediate vicinity of DHMC, but steer clear of Summit on Juniper. I live there now, and it's quite expensive for very poor quality amenities (despite the advertising). My roommate and I are actively looking for a new place to live once our lease is up.\n\nDartmouth also has Sachem Village (through the Real Estate Office) just outside of Hanover, which are pretty good quality condo-style units. Those leases are typically July to July and vacancies are announced about 3 months prior to availability.\n\nHope this helps, and best of luck in the search!",

The further you look from Hanover, the less expensive places are, but public transportation is bad in the area. It's called Advance Transit, and it's free but the bus lines only run on weekdays, ending at 5 or 6pm.",

Depending on your situation, homestead exemption or renter's deductions could bring that down.\n\nAlso, there are sometimes rentals that get posted on town-specific listservs.  Check those out [here](https://vitalcommunities.org/community-discussion-lists/).  That may help,[ as the vacancy rate in the area is extremely low \\(0.5%\\).](https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2022/08/04/new-hampshire-rental-availability-rate-well-below-national-averages/)  \n\nSummit on Juniper was mentioned above - their heating system failed during the coldest part of the year, and they couldn't get everyone heated for a month.  [Their response was slow, meager and very disappointing](https://www.vnews.com/Dartmouth-graduate-students-criticize-property-managers-college-for-heating-problems-at-Summit-on-Jupiter-49870903).  \n\nWherever you look, take the time to see what your commute might be like in the morning and evening. Coming in through the bridge from Norwich is pretty bad at certain times of days, and driving past DHMC from the south can be similarly painful. Unfortunately, all the places where the traffic isn't horrible are where the rents are expensive. So you kind of have to pick your poison.\n\nAnd large portions of VT, and much of the area north of Hanover are a gamble for cell reception and internet. Make sure you have a clear idea of how many bars/Mbps are available at a rental. Ask what your internet options are, as it may turn out all you can get is slow DSL connection from Consolidated (formerly Fairpoint).",

Boston Lot is a leisurely hike to a pond right next to DH. You have the NH 4000 footers (Moosilauke is a stand out) and many similar hikes in VT. Plenty of places to ski, including the Dartmouth Skiway in Lyme (which is a nice hike in the summer called Holt's Ledge).\n\nThe Dartmouth Outing Club has a bunch of cabins you can rent for the weekend all around the state, too.\n\nOh and the people here love their seasonal ice cream shops!",

As you go further afield you can get more space for less money but during a winter storm you may not be able to make it to work. Also keep in mind how far you want to be from grocery stores \u2013 the further from West Lebanon you get the longer your shopping trips will take.",

            "comment": "Hi, welcome to the Upper Valley! I skimmed the comments but didn't see any mentions of if you have a car or not. Most grad/med students who don't have cars stick to places along the Advance Transit (free local bus serving Hanover, Leb, West Leb, WRJ, Norwich, sometimes Enfield), which is a really awesome resource. If you'll be driving, you'll have a lot more options as far as affordable housing. The area is insanely expensive and there is a housing shortage so it's not getting any better soon. I work on campus daily and come from 10 miles away in WRJ area which I find to be great. The towns are quite small and interconnected. Rents will be best in WRJ/Hartford/Enfield, or much better if you go to Hartland (another 10 miles south on 91). BUT, if you keep looking you could get lucky and find a better spot more locally. I've been seeing a lot of 1bd apts on Facebook Marketplace for around $1300/month recently and that seems to be a low average for the really local area.",

Leb and Hanover are expensive and don't have chain stores. Vermont has sales tax so stores build on the NH side of the river. We just got a Target and that's been pretty exciting seeing as the next closest one is 80 miles away. Most people here love being outdoors and hiking/enjoying the mountains and you will find a lot of opportunities of that sort. There are also a few bars and stuff but I've never been interested so don't know what theyre like. A lot of good restaurants and a number of theatres and other cultural venues. It's a cool place.",

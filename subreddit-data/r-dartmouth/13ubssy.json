            "comment": "Any term during which you take classes counts as an on term, including summer term. For sophomore summer, you typically take an off term during the \"regular\" school year instead (so fall, winter, or spring). Good selection of courses offered but definitely the least out of any of the 4 terms.\n\nIf you're really determined you can petition out of it, I know some people do that for athletics if they need to be on for other terms.",

            "comment": "Disclaimer is that I'm also a '27 but this is what I understand:\n\nSophomore summer (and any summer term you decide to take on, because you can do that) is not an off term. You take classes normally and take a different term off. According to my Dimensions host, a lot of people take the spring term before their sophomore summer off (although I think the winter might be better lmao).\n\nAll classes are not regularly offered, and it seems like often fewer courses are offered from some departments in the summer--but also, not all courses that are regularly offered each year are regularly offered each term. I think I remember hearing that CS30 is only offered in Fall and Winter, and that's not at all unusual. So classes that are offered in the summer just fit into that I suppose.",

    "postText": "I have been working on this app for a while now and I am really excited to share it with you. It's a college marketplace restricted to students. You can buy, or sell anything you want to other students, ranging from dorm supplies, textbooks, lost&amp; found, promote services, tutoring, apparel (anything really!) ride-sharing, to subleasing or finding off-campus housing for next year ...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of hard work went into it so make sure you check it out if you need anything for the upcoming semesters! You can only log in once you verify your **dartmouth.edu** school email! (you'll receive a 5 digit code in your inbox)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlink to the app: [https://collegesouk.com/](https://collegesouk.com/) and tell your friends!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalso maybe follow on ig [https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/](https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/) ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, please go ahead and post something people are already using it :) \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc2b hope it helps (upvote for visibility)! - might be a little glitchy on galaxy hoping to fix that soon, also just want to mention that the idea is abstracted to support multiple universities :) each university got its own separate marketplace!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, please dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this or if anyone is interested in contributing!

I wanted to see if anyone knows if classes are held mostly near Hanover or in Lebanon where TDI is. Im not sure which town (even though they\u2019re close) is best to look for rentals in. I\u2019ll only be there for a year so I want to get the most out of my experience but I also can\u2019t spend an arm and a leg on rent. Thank you so much if you are able to help:)",

I currently plan on doing a CS-Econ double major but I'm not sure of what career I want to pursue afterward.

            "comment": "Hi! and congratulations on your acceptances to two wonderful schools and the full scholarship! I'd say.. in general, if you cannot afford the school..it's wiser not to take on large amounts of debt for an undergraduate education.. esp. considering you have a full tuition option. There are indeed several careers immediately after studying econ/cs at Dartmouth that would be able to pay down the debt fairly quickly (within 2-3 years if frugal). The average Dartmouth CS major earns over 100k/yr starting salary according to gov. financial aid students outcome report. But this is not guaranteed and even less so since you are an international student and will have to be sponsored by a company to work in the US. \n\n\"but I'm not sure of what career I want to pursue afterward\"\n\nSince you are not sure yet what career you want to pursue, there is even more risk to the situation. \n\nIt also depends on what the salaries are in your home country and what reputation Dartmouth has with local employers compared with Lafayette in the case you don't get visa sponsored to work in the US. In the worst case scenario, you don't want to be stuck paying off 100k debt + interest for &gt; 10 years etc just to attend Dartmouth over Lafayette. Again, this is a lot of risk to take on for an undergraduate education. \n\nGood luck!",

Even though Dartmouth may not have the same name recognition internationally as Harvard and Yale, it does open doors to certain jobs for its undergrads that may be harder for grads of Lafayette to get \u2014 specifically, elite investment banks and elite management consulting firms (McKinsey, Bain, BCG).  If your goal is to get one of those jobs, then it MAY be worth taking out $100k in loans.  If you are not focused on those jobs, then I would think long and hard before turning down a full merit scholarship to Lafayette.  If you do very well academically at Lafayette, you will be in an excellent position to apply to top graduate and professional schools.  And, if you do want to get an advanced degree, it would be wonderful to not start it with $100k of debt from undergrad.  Note \u2014 I have no insight into the CS job market, so I would suggest researching the job placement statistics for CS grads from both Lafayette and Dartmouth.",

I am a current PhD student here at the big green and had the pleasure of having a Lafayette alumni as my undergrad PI while I attended Union. I can say if you have the ability to earn a full scholarship to a school like Lafayette and got into Dartmouth you seem like a very capable person. Attending Dartmouth is imo in no way worth 100k dollars over attending an elite liberal arts school like Lafayette. Dartmouth has a, how should I say, gentle curriculum and grading policy for undergrads. I have TA'ed several classes for the biology department and it's a bit of a joke. It only gets worse with higher level classes. I have heard the engineering departments are better about this. \n\nAll this to say is I would think very hard about what specifically you think or know Dartmouth can provide that Lafayette cannot. Lafayette is a great school. Dartmouth leaves a lot to be desired and is undeniably riding their ivy league reputation. The way they handled COVID is evidence of this. Not to mention the 20yr long housing crisis in this area. \n\nA college degree is worth as much as the person holding it. You will be fine without an ivy pedigree and be much better off without the debt. Hope this sheds a bit of light on the matter.",

But I agree with the last part. Choosing Dartmouth with heavy debts over a full-ride LAC is a risky move, especially as an international student. \n\n\"A college degree is worth as much as the person holding it.\"\n\nExactly.

Or if they plan to stay in the US, whether they think they can leverage the alumni network here for a good job. I will say Dartmouth isn't exactly known for being hyperinclusive. So definitely something to think about. But bottom line Lafayette is a great school and a free college education is a huge leg up when graduating as it will lend incredible flexibility as to what your options are at that point.

I am familiar with Lafayette and I'm sure OP would get a good education in whatever major they study there if they choose to attend. But OP is essentially asking if it's worth 100k to get a leg up in recruiting for Wall Street as an international needing visa sponsorship. Dartmouth's connections on Wall Street are much stronger than Lafayette making it a slightly more interesting argument. If OP is trying to become an academic or go to grad school, this wouldn't even be a conversation Lafayette full-ride definitely over 100k debts. I personally am risk-averse so would not take on large debt for undergraduate in most any situations but it depends on OP's priorities and financial situation.",

What you would have to focus on mainly is get experience ( whether academically by taking on extracurriculars or research projects and finding internships ) and building your personal brand. If you start with that mindset from the get-go when start your undergrad, you will not have any issue landing a full-time CS job at a prestigious tech or consulting company. \nNow, if you\u2019re that worried about the Ivy brand or at least would like to get it on your resume, then do your undergrad at Lafayette and graduate with 0-debt and at least a B+ GPA and then apply to Ivy-league schools for their Masters program. \nAnd as an example, I did the same. I applied to Columbia, Dartmouth, and Cornell and I got into all of them for my Masters. And now, because I had no debt after graduating from my undergrad, I have the luxury to take on a huge debt for Masters to achieve my long term goals .\nHopefully, this will shed some light from a fellow F-1 student.",

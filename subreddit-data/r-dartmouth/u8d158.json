    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a \u201826 and have been thinking about what courses I might want to take this fall term. My intended major is neuroscience on the pre-health track, and I know that on average students will take 3 classes per term. \n\nI was wondering if anyone has suggestions as to what courses I could take. I\u2019m looking for a mix of harder and easier classes that I could take to fulfill my requirements while not completely ruining my GPA. \n\n2 classes I\u2019m considering are Math 3 and Psyc 6 but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a good idea to take both in the same term.",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am currently in senior year of high school. I started creating my college list, however I have met some problems. I could not find anything about research opportunities from students of universities I want to apply. Research opportunities are really important for me since I am going to major in chemistry(focus on physical chemistry more than biological chemistry or medicine). Also, I find it hard to find out which courses will be mandatory to get a degree. Could you tell more about these aspects of Northwestern, Yale, Amherst, Duke, Dartmouth, University of Chicago, Cornell, Brown, Caltech, and Stanford? Which universities provide better courses on physical chemistry?\n\nFor the record: these universities are in my \"reach\" and \"wild\" categories, so I need to cut them out.",

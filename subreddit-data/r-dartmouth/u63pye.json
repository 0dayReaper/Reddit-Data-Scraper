You download all materials and submit to them as one package and they review your application. I've never done it myself but I have two interns who were accepted to Dali while in my internship program and one who did my program + Dali at the same time (we're an upper valley company) and it was tough for her but now she's an SDEII @ Amazon just 1 year out of Dartmouth and Dali and making $180K a year....so like I said, it's worth it to try and get in. They teach you a lot of soft skills that make working in tech much easier.",

I wouldn't be surprised if that has picked up some in recent years, though, with the increase in popularity of VR as a medium (thanks, Oculus), helped on campus by an undergrad course for AR &amp; VR design &amp; development. I just checked on the course listing, and the design portion of the course is also offered as a grad level course (123), if that's something you're interested in.",

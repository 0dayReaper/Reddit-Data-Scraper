    "postText": "Since I keep seeing \"What does X dorm look like?\" posts I figured I'd make a brief thread about each dorm. \n\n**EAST WHEELOCK** (Andres, McCulloch, Morton, Zimmerman)  \nThe cluster is newly renovated and has pretty nice amenities. I believe the bathrooms are private use and there are even rooms with their own private bathrooms. It's far from the rest of campus, but it's next to the gym. Overall it's one of the better dorms to live in IMO. I believe one of the buildings is undergoing renovation so you might be put into a different, older hall. \n\n**WEST HOUSE** (French, Judge)  \nThe river is usually considered one of the worse dorms for freshmen. It's really far away from campus (past the engineering school) but if you do have an engineering/CS class, it's literally right next door. The amenities are also old and the bathrooms aren't the best. There is a common room for each building on the first floor. There's only like 4 washers/dryers for each building. However, there are only singles and two-room doubles which means you will have some privacy. Usually people say that the river cluster bonds together quite tightly over the winter given the remote-ish location. \n\n**ALLEN/SCHOOL HOUSE** (Choates, Wheeler, Richardson)  \nThe Choates consist of Brown, Little, Bissell, and Cohen. I think this is where the majority freshmen will live. It's right next to Frat Row and the location is mostly in the center of campus. The buildings are pretty old but the singles are actually decently spacious. There are cute little hamster tunnels that connect each building. The Choates are also a pretty tight cluster and there are some common rooms scattered throughout. The bathrooms aren't great but aren't bad. For Wheeler and Richardson, the location is decent as well. It's near the library and the center of campus. The amenities aren't the greatest but they definitely aren't bad. \n\n**NORTH HOUSE** (Hotel McLaughlin)  \nIt's nicknamed \"Hotel\" because it's one of the newest dorms on campus. There's even an elevator for each floor and the amenities are all brand new. There are only singles and two-room doubles and the bathrooms are also private use. McLaughlin consists of Berry, Bildner, Rauner, Bryne, Goldstein, and Thomas. If you live here you're pretty lucky. The only drawback is that McLaughlin is pretty far from the center of campus (not as far as the river). \n\n**SOUTH HOUSE** (North, Mid, South Fayerweather)   \nThe fayes have a pretty nice location and are right next to the green and the HOP. It's usually known for being one of the more \"rowdier\" dorms. The amenities aren't the best and I've heard that the building is pretty old. The location definitely makes up for it though. \n\nHonestly all the freshmen dorms are okay IMO. For the most part, **you'll get used to living in your dorm pretty quickly** and there are strengths and drawbacks to each building. If you are still curious about your building, you should be able to find the floorplans and more information online. Some of the things I wrote here might be wrong depending on what changes year-to-year but this should be a decently comprehensive list of what freshmen dorms are like.",

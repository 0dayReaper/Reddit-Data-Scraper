    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming freshman at Dartmouth, and I'm pretty set on taking Ecology as one of my main courses (with two easier courses). There's a lab portion, but I don't have much experience writing professional lab reports or using Excel at a high level, so I was wondering what writing the reports are like. \n\nI would appreciate if somebody with experience in these STEM labs could explain what they were like in terms of formatting, grading, etc. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Writing reports is a pain, but if you want to be a biol major, it's going to be a chronic pain. The intro courses are set up to help you learn report writing and excel work, they don't assume you have experience in it from high school. The learning curve is high, but you can get it if you're dedicated. And TAs are also happy to set up time with you, whether in office hours or outside of that, if you're really struggling with writing.\n\nTo your second question, labs are a pretty big grading component but midterms still take priority. There's usually a data component and a writing component for labs, i.e. how you handle experimental techniques and then how well you write them up. So even if you have some trouble with technical work, you can be a strong writer and make up points",

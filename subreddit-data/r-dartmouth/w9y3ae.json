    "postText": "I have many questions so I apologize in advance.\n\n1. Are the dorms hardwood? \n\n2. How big are the rooms typically? (Standard singles and standard two room doubles)\n\n3. How\u2019s the closet space/what kind of storage container should we get based on the available space? (Ik at some schools there\u2019s sometimes shelving that you can put little storage cubbies in and stuff) \n\n4. Have there been any issues with it? Something that might need to be fixed by purchasing stuff\n\n5. Any General info is much appreciated!",

In a two room double, the outer room is a bit bigger since the inner one has both closets. I had no problem being in the inner room though\n3. Despite the weird two closets in one room thing for the doubles, the closets are really spacious! You also get a dresser with five drawers and a desk with three. I recommend bringing some under-the-bed storage containers to make the most of the space though\n4. Even though we have AC, you should still bring a fan with you. Last spring they weren\u2019t able to get the AC on during a heatwave in May so my fan was a lifesaver! And if you\u2019re on the first floor, maybe bring some extra blankets for winter since that floor tends to be colder than the others (I was very cozy on the second floor though lol)\n5. Nothing comes to mind rn, but feel free to PM me with other questions!",

When I was there, we knew that the buildings had AC capability, but it was only used for reunion weekends. For the rest of us, we weren't even allowed to have AC except for a few select cases -- everyone had to use fans. My roommates and I were allowed an AC because one of my roommates had severe allergies and asthma, to the point where we couldn't really have the windows open/fans going most of the time. \n\nYou guys are soooo lucky if they're actually using the AC on you!",

What is it like specifically?\n\n(Also, could yall just add what writing course y'all chose and why? Is it worth going through the writing 5 rigour?)",

However, I would advise you to take humanities 1 and then switch to a writing 5 class because hum 2 was boring af with a couple of the readings being like 120 pages of a philosopher's wet dream. If you are into that kind of stuff props to you but I would take hum 1 then switch out. Congrats and welcome to Dartmouth. Heres a link for more info. \n\n[https://www.dartmouth.edu/hums1-2/](https://www.dartmouth.edu/hums1-2/)",

            "comment": "Wassup!! Also a \u201826 (deferred from \u201825), but Writing 5 is like the regular course most 1st years take. I\u2019ve heard lots of good things about the course especially since there are a lot of different topics that are offered. Writing 2-3 is more of a focused/remedial course for those who don\u2019t feel as confident and maybe come in with less ability. Hum 1 is an intensive writing course that goes through a lot more material and has greater workload. So if you are comfortable with your writing and don\u2019t want the more intensive workload you\u2019d probs go for Writ 5, if you want an intensive study/discussion based class ab classics in lit Hum 1 is cool. If you want more help with your writing going into college and don\u2019t have lots of experience/confidence the you\u2019ll probs want to go for Writ 2-3. A lot is self selection although I think there is a write on essay-type test for the Hum courses.",

It (depending on which section you choose) is a pretty chill class in comparison to the other options and should be an easy A/A-. Also, don't stress too much about the placement essay (like I did) if you want to do Writ 5, as I think it's the default placement. My friend never even submitted the essay and got put in it.",

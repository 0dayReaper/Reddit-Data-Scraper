    "postText": "Hello all! I'm a 27 and I'd like to major in government (possibly modified with economics) I'd also like to go into either consulting or IB for two to three years before law school. My basic understanding of the interview process for both IB and consulting is that they ask you technical questions like case studies or financial modeling questions. Are there any specific financial modeling or business-oriented classes that I should take to be prepared for the interview/career? Or are financial modeling/case studies something that you're supposed to learn outside of the classroom? Im a FGLI student with absolutely no family background in finance so any help would be greatly appreciated!!",

            "comment": "I interviewed Dartmouth undergrads for a well-known consultancy for years. At our firm, no one cared, but being able to do well on the case interview helped quite a bit. Some people found Ace Your Case or similar to be of use. Being facile with numbers and understanding basic microeconomics (which might or might not require taking a course) help. Reading the Wall Street Journal is a good idea. We didn't ask any technical questions, unless you and I have divergent definitions of what constitutes a technical question -- you need to have a pretty solid grasp that revenue minus costs equals profit, which, surprisingly, many don't. I suppose if you understand how the binomial theorem and compound interest have similarities, that could be useful, but it never once came up.\nI suppose if spreadsheets are not obvious to you, you might want to address it, but it doesn't have anything to do with the interviews. \nI can't speak about banking.",

            "comment": "1.) calm down. 2.) if you\u2019re doing IB, there is no point in doing law school because there are far less painful ways to get to Harvard- like consulting for example. 3.) consulting is not that hard to prep for, the only thing is it\u2019s harder to get an internship than a full time role, which brings me to point 4.) you need a high GPA for both of these things and law school (gov also does very little to help you for law school unless you want to be a DC public service person) but both of the majors you have mentioned have B median curves, which is why people usually do Econ + something else. 5.) you will not learn how to recruit inside the classroom. You will have to join clubs and talk to upper class men who will help you out. Everything you learn in school is lowkey useless for recruiting except if you can take classes at Tuck as a sophomore (those can be helpful). What I would do is during your winter break of freshman year talk to as many people as you can to figure out what you want, because the three career paths you have mentioned are not very interrelated.",

Especially if you\u2019re a POC, there are many diversity programs to be had (from these banks and consulting companies) that will help ease the gap. But know that you will have to work twice as hard as legacy students because everyone somehow knows what they are doing because their parents did finance/consulting.",

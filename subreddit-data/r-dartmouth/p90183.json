    "postText": " Hello!\n\nI'm a rising high school senior that is applying to colleges this fall. I've narrowed down my ED schools to Williams and Dartmouth and I'm having a bit of trouble deciding between the two schools. I would appreciate any insight that students had that would help me decide. For reference, I will most likely want to study Economics and do something with math, whether that be either doing a double major or getting a minor in math. I will also be cross-posting this to both [r/WilliamsCollege](https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/) and [r/dartmouth](https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/) to get as much input as possible from current students or alumni.\n\nIn terms of the quality of education, I have heard good things about both schools, especially in regards to their econ departments as they are very popular at both colleges. I think the math department at Williams is quite a bit stronger than Dartmouth's, though. Moreover, both schools say they're \"undergraduate-focused\" but I think this is more true of Williams where classes are smaller than Dartmouth and fewer students are competing for research positions and stuff like that especially in a major as popular as econ. Some Wiliams students I have talked to said they even chose Williams over HYPSM because of this and said that Williams has the best quality of education in the world. Does Dartmouth compare? Also, Williams has the Oxford-style tutorials which seem dope.\n\nThe Alumni network also matters to me a lot since I am strongly considering entering ib/consulting after school. I've heard that both schools are targets and that both have fiercely loyal alumni. However, Dartmouth has a much larger pre-professional vibe to it and there are a lot more people in investment banking and consulting that came from Dartmouth than Williams. While Dartmouth is a stronger target and sends more kids to top firms each year, there are a lot more kids that want to go do down the path of finance/consulting so there may be less competition at Williams making it easier to break in. I don't really know which is better, but I would say maybe Dartmouth because they have more resources for these students but I would appreciate any insight that students or alumni have at each schools.\n\nThis is kinda unique to Dartmouth but I don't know whether the D-Plan is on net good or bad. I've heard that it can open you up to taking internships or research positions in unorthodox times when there is a lot less competition which sounds cool. Sophomore summer and \"Camp Dartmouth\" sound cool too. I've heard people say it makes academic life easier but others have said it's made it a lot more fast-paced and requires tons of work to keep up with. I've also heard it can rip friendships apart since differences in schedules means you could go a whole year without seeing a friend.\n\nIn terms of the campuses, I, unfortunately, do not have the opportunity to visit either Williams or Dartmouth. Architecture and the \"look\" of a school matter to me a lot though. I really like the rural vibes of both the schools. If anyone can comment on the vibes of each campus that would be great.\n\nIn terms of social life, both again say they foster community and collaboration over competition. However, the people at Williams seem a lot more chill and friendly than the people at Dartmouth, which I've perceived to have a very preppy vibe to it and a lot more fake people. idk tho that's just what I've picked up from the vlogs I've watched and things I've heard. Williams concerns me a bit because I have heard the social scene can be very dead, with most people studying all weekend. However, Dartmouth also concerns me due to the huge prevalence of binge drinking culture and partying.\n\nThat brings me to greek life. From what I have heard, Dartmouth seems to downplay it but over 60% of people are members of some sort of greek life organization. I have tried to look up stuff online about frats but couldn't find much. I don't really think I would enjoy frats and I'm even more concerned since if admitted I will be on lots of financial aid so I don't know if I'll be able to afford to join one if I wanted to down the road. I have also heard some frats have stronger alumni connections than normal students have access to, which is also concerning. I'm just all around very apprehensive of the whole system.\n\nLastly, I know this is really stupid, but the ivy league pReStIGe is also something that is very enticing to me, especially since nobody really knows much about Williams but most people know about Dartmouth. I am aware that my perception of prestige is probably different from future employers, but I was wondering if the Ivy League branding that comes with Dartmouth really matters in the future?\n\nI would appreciate any insight from anyone, especially if they had to choose between Williams and Dartmouth, or one of those schools and another top school. Thank you in advance to all who reply!",

            "comment": "You'll have a good education at either school, and both will have good prospects at finance firms. That said, I think the finance network at Dartmouth may be stronger, as there are just so many people who go into different firms. You should also focus a little more on the culture you want and less on the superficial stuff (e.g. architecture). They both are really undergrad focused, so that's a point in both school's columns. Williams' tutoring system had really interested me as an applicant. But you'll find that higher level Dartmouth classes, seminars, just end up being smaller because there aren't many people in a particular niche. However, econ is Dartmouth's biggest major. Competition is tight and medians are enforced. It's in the department's best interests to keep the major competitive because they'd have a poor reputation if everyone had an easy A. Your education at any school is what you make of it. You can slack at Williams and not get a lot out of their profs. You can work hard at Dartmouth and have close relationships with your professors. That's up to you, they both have excellent education quality. The econ major isn't cut-throat and you can study with your friends. But you will also know that you're competing with your peers at the end of the day. Not sure how that compares to Williams' culture. \n\nThe D-plan is good for internships, don't worry about its social impact. If someone actually wants to stay your friend, being apart for a term or two won't be the end of the world. I was away from one of my best friends for two quarters and we made it. It's been three years since graduating and we're still in touch even though we haven't seen each other since the night before graduation. Also, it's 2021, we have phones and Zoom and all that. If a friendship falls apart, then it probably wasn't that strong in the first place or it was mismanaged. These are just good life lessons to learn.\n\nWilliams doesn't have greek life, but students still rage a lot and make up for the lack of a literal social structure in their own way.  Greek life is undeniably big at Dartmouth, and it's also big if you want to be around other finance-y kids. Most schools have party cultures, but you don't have to binge drink at Dartmouth or any other if you don't want to. Our party culture is pretty BYOA (bring your own attitude). If you're chill and fun to be around, then people will hang with you. You're not going to get a hard time from someone else if you don't drink as much as them if you also don't judge them for it. Just be a good friend and the rest follows. E.g. if you want to play pong with your friends, you can have water in your cups and no one will think twice about it.  Many frats have internal financial aid, so you can work on figuring out dues with your organization. You can also hang out at frats without being a member and you never have to pay a cent. Choose your own adventure.\n\nTo your prestige point, you'd be surprised about Dartmouth name value. It's not a very well-known school even though it is an Ivy. Somewhat more well known than Williams but not by too much. That said, people definitely recognize it sometimes and it's nice to have a little cach\u00e9 attached to your name. However, you'll find that most of us alums tend to play down the fact that we went to Dartmouth for a couple reasons. For one, it's a cultural thing. We love the school and don't like people thinking that we're throwing the name around for points, so we keep it to ourselves. For another, there are some poorer connotations. Dartmouth's known for the partying reputation and it's not always nice to have people think you're a high-functioning alcoholic before they get to know anything else about you.\n\nI'll end on the overall culture note because I want it to be the last thing that you come away with. Dartmouth is a place of passionate people. Not everyone is passionate about the same thing, but everyone has at least one *thing*. Sometimes it's superficial, sometimes it's deep-seated and powerful, but it's a thing nonetheless. Being in a rural area amplifies that because you don't have too much else to do. For some people, the environment is that thing. We're an outdoorsy bunch, and hikes or canoeing are common recreational activities for groups. New Hampshire has a way of getting in your bones. And over your four years, you'll find people you share your passions with. Those people are going to be a big part of why you come away from Dartmouth feeling lucky you went there",

            "comment": "Dartmouth and Williams have a lot in common. I wanted to go Williams and am glad I ended up at Dartmouth. A few thoughts - \n\nWilliams is small. Really small. By the time you\u2019re a senior you\u2019ll be sick of everyone. \n\nWilliams is rural. Really rural. Dartmouth has a bigger town and easier connections to Boston, NYC AND Burlington. \n\nThe Ivy League prestige is real. Even though Williams is a little Ivy less people will have heard of it compared to Dartmouth. \n\nThe Greek system is big at D but it\u2019s not the only thing people do. Everyone is Greek AND does something else so being Greek is only part of their identity and activities on campus. There are also plenty of people who aren\u2019t Greek and D\u2019s Greek system is one of the most open and inclusive in higher ed. You can still go to parties and hang out at houses even if you don\u2019t rush. Plus you have until Soph year to decide (can\u2019t rush until Soph year at the earliest) what you want to do. And houses offer financial aid so money doesn\u2019t have to be a barrier for joining a house. \n\nBoth are excellent schools where you can have a great experience and get a great education. Like most things in life it will be depend on what you make of it. So don\u2019t stress too much and good luck!",

            "comment": "Everyone here has already made great points so I'll add my personal experience.\n\nI love the D-plan. I love the flexibility. I moved around a lot as a child and don't mind not seeing people for a while. In fact, over the pandemic I took a gap year (thanks, D-plan, for making that super easy) so I went a literal year (and some change) without seeing my friends. And now that I'm back I still have friends. Did my friendships and relationships get changed by the D-plan and the extended break I took? You bet. But hey, that's an even better way to find out who is chill.\n\nI also love the ten week terms and have only heard similar from my classmates. Do you like studying and school to at least some extent? Do you genuinely like the field you want to go into? If you do, then you will love the ten week terms. \n\nI do not plan to join a sorority (I am a woman). If I could join a frat I probably would but... again, I am a woman. Greek life is huge here. No getting around it. But I can mooch off my friends' Greek life connections. Even better, there are lots of open parties and worst comes to worst I can go frat to frat knocking on doors. Sounds awkward but that's all I did freshman year and it worked. I would say the biggest downside of the Greek life stuff is how clout-chase-y I feel when I hit up my friends to let me into their party... ick. But it's not really normal Greek life like they're showing on TikTok recently with Bama Rush (and I know b/c I'm originally from the American south). It's totally different and definitely superior. \n\nTons of friendly and kind people at Dartmouth, tons of assholes. But that will be the fact at every school. Yes, there are drinking problems. Again, that's pretty common at college unfortunately.\n\nSomeone else on this thread has mentioned Dartmouth's response to COVID. I don't agree with some of the things they did, and there's no denying they made the COVID year miserable for everyone on campus / taking classes. But I also don't agree with how some of my more pigheaded classmates are reacting / have reacted. I can't really say more than that b/c I took a gap year. You have to make your own choices and live with them. You are paying for college, and you need to take control of your education, regardless of what dumb shit the admin do. I don't love the Dartmouth admin. They made shitty decisions regarding the music and phys sci libraries, study abroad, HOUSING (!!!). But let's face it, at any college, you have zero control over what the admin do. Hopefully a COVID situation won't happen again anytime soon.\n\nDartmouth has a stunning campus and I am honestly shocked every sunny day by the fact I live here. But I'm a sucker for aesthetics and also that did not impact my choice to go here at all, and I would advise you to not let it impact your choice either. Finally, I'll say I picked Dartmouth because of that Ivy prestige you mentioned, but I'm actually glad now I go here for the amazing profs, intelligent people, and superb education. I have zero regrets. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions! : )",

            "comment": "Everyone has made great points. I'll add some more perspective based on my personal D experience. I am double STEM major (likely), one of which is likely applied math--I am still tweaking things a bit (too many academic passions). I applied ED (to Dartmouth) and considered Williams also. I did like Williams and I also really liked the tutorials. That is what made me realize that I did want a liberal arts school. But I wanted a larger liberal arts school; Williams felt a bit small. I wanted a more 'hopping' social and academic scene that would come with a bigger school. I would have liked a really big school, but my desire for a liberal arts school where I didn't have to declare my major coming in and could explore my different interests more fully was more important. I also am on financial aid. So that's my background.\n\nAlso caveat. I can't contrast Williams versus Dartmouth.  I am just conveying my Dartmouth experience. Maybe Williams has the same things, I don't know. Hopefully Williams students and alums will weigh in so you get the same perspectives about Williams.\n\nSecond, I am not going to talk about academics except to say the following. Both schools are great. Dartmouth econ department is big and famous.... I have had so many fantastic classes and professors. I got involved in research and joined a lab (meaning prof, grad students, post-docs) early on. I'm currently in 2 different labs and that's a great academic community for me. I get paid for my work in the labs and my summer research projects have been paid too. I have not done 'internships' per se; I have been doing research with professors. My friends are all in different majors and all equally passionate about their own interests. I love that and that's why I didn't apply to a tech focused university. I really wanted my friends to come from a diversity of academic interests.\n\nBut what drew me to Dartmouth was the community and culture. You mentioned \"preppy culture\" ?!? Um, no. The descriptions you'll hear are 'chill', 'passionate', and 'fun-loving' and also academic and Ivy. Oh, and 'flair' (lol). [https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2021/05/the-flair-that-binds-us](https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2021/05/the-flair-that-binds-us)  Yeah, my parents didn't quite understand why I am lugging around a wedding dress (for hiking) and tiger onesie (for hockey) but it is essential. How can I play intramural hockey without my onesie given to me by a senior on the team! How can I describe Dartmouth \"community\"? I remember being a HS rising senior and trying to decide for sure if I wanted to apply ED to Dartmouth. I'd visited and fallen in love with it---the vibe, the look, the huge outing club---but was trying to make sure of my choice. I talked with a bunch of Dartmouth alums. First off, they were like me with academic passions but really into the outdoors, so good sign there. But what struck me was how they described the closeness of the communities they were in. For quite a few, it was a greek house they were part of. Others described the Dartmouth Outing Club (DOC) communities or the Organic Farm communities (more up my alley). But each described an intense community-experience that defined their Dartmouth years. That's what I wanted (besides great academics). \n\nYou hear the term 'bleed green' and you maybe think of going to football games or something like that. That's not it. It's more like the community that you'd get by being on a sports team, but here people get that intense community experience from a variety of communities besides sports teams. Greek houses (yes), but also DOC, dance or singing clubs, affinity clubs, and obviously sports teams if you are on one (I am not). Also a feeling of connection to the D's before you is real. I live in a DOC off-campus house with a 40+ year history. All around me is the history of D's like me from years past. If you are in a greek house, you feel that same connection to those before you. D's quirky tradition of handing down flair also connects us to the past D's. I have great pride in my silly onesie knowing that it has been worn by members of my subclub for many years. When I graduate, I will hand it down in a ceremony to a younger subclub member.\n\nI am personally deep into the DOC. If I am not studying, I am doing and leading trips and activities with my DOC community. There are multiple sub-clubs and I'm involved with 4 and so I'm spread pretty thin. Again how do I describe it in a way that an outsider would understand? Go on the DOC website and find the photos (on the right nav). But I would also read one of the Woodsmoke's ([https://outdoors.dartmouth.edu/doc/woodsmoke.html](https://outdoors.dartmouth.edu/doc/woodsmoke.html)) to get a sense of the passion of what your Dartmouth classmates would be like. Yes, this is outdoor focused, and maybe that's not your thing. That's fine. It just gives you a glimpse into one specific instance of what 'passionate' means here. And gives you insight into what \"community\" really means and feels like. We have so many crazy traditions. You can google a few of them, but you won't find most of them. We are crazy. This summer I did the wet ass portage where 20+ of us carry a canoe up Mt Washington and paddle it in a pond. There are so many crazy traditions like this that are done every year.\n\nRegarding greek life. I am not personally involved in the frats nor are any of my close friends. Really I have zero time for that because my academics and DOC community leave no time for that. As others have noted, no one is going to pressure you to drink and you don't have to be part of greek life. I drink socially---like when I am hanging out with friends but drinking or getting drunk is not the goal---and I am not in a frat. But for me, parties are a really fun part of Dartmouth. All the frat parties are open (just show your ID). There are 3 on-nights a week. In freshman year, I'd go out to parties like 2x a week unless it was grind time (mid-terms or finals). I also go to non-frat social events. My friends and I would have a schedule for a Friday night say that would involve a variety of events including some frat events, DOC off-campus gatherings, events sponsored by our house, etc. Each quarter (pre-Covid at least) there is a big party weekend: Homecoming, Winter Carnival, and Key Green. What a blast! It takes a bit to recover because you don't really sleep that weekend. It's not just parties---it's all kinds of different events and activities that not just the college organizes but also your peers (clubs and greek houses). I personally love this vibrant social life combined with an intense academic life.\n\nAlso regarding greek life, be aware that there are many different houses with vastly different cultures and vibes. I mean along with what you think of as a traditional greek houses, there is a 'milk and cookies' and board games co-ed greek house....\n\nOh crud. It's week 10. Gotta go study!",

            "comment": "I had this decision a few years back, having been accepted at both, and decided to attend Williams; I wholeheartedly loved my time at Williams, but there are a lot of similarities with Dartmouth that makes your decision much more nuanced than one could imagine with a surface level analysis of the two. I can break down my thinking, but I'd like to point out a few notes from your analysis:\n\n* Ivy League prestige shouldn't really be a huge deciding factor between Dartmouth and Williams. In the US, most people can't name all 8 Ivies, let alone most people don't know what \"Dartmouth\" is. The people who have heard of Dartmouth and know that it is a prestigious institution have also heard of Williams and know that it is also a prestigious institution.\n* Dartmouth has the D-Plan, but Williams has Winter Study and very well-structured on-campus summer programs which have some advantages/disadvantages when compared to the D-Plan. On the upside, there is more \"structure\" to when students are on-campus/off-campus. On the downside, the \"D-Plan\" is more flexible in terms of when you can leave campus.\n* In terms of employers, Dartmouth and Williams are both intensely recruited so I wouldn't worry about splitting hairs on this either. These colleges have fanatically loyal alumni (top 3 along with Princeton in terms of donation rates \\* avg. amount donated), and they are both well-respected in highly-selective, elite professions for entry-level grads (investment banking, consulting, PE, big tech, pre-law at big law firms, etc.). Dartmouth has a larger alumni network, but pound-for-pound, the two schools punch way above their weight class (if you catch the metaphor -- proportionate to their alumni bases, they are about even in their representation in highly sought-ater professions, which is well above the average for most elite schools) in terms of on-campus recruiting. For whichever profession you decide to start your career in, both institutions will give you a huge advantage. A caveat, however, is that Dartmouth's Greek life acts as a pipeline for a lot of elite professions, whereas such a pipeline doesn't exist at Williams.\n\nIn terms of breaking down your analysis, I think it's valuable to prioritize what matters most to you. If architecture really matters a lot to you, for example, then keep that in the criteria, but narrow down your selection criteria to what you feel is most valuable to your education. In my case, I cared most about optimizing for: (1) quality of undergraduate education, (2) college support for extracurricular projects/work, and (3) alumni network. At the breakdown between Williams and Dartmouth, I came to the following conclusions:\n\n1. Williams and Dartmouth both provide excellent undergraduate educations. However, Williams is a more undergraduate focused institution, which is why I gave the edge to it on this point.\n2. Williams and Dartmouth are both well-resourced institutions, but Williams has a much higher endowment-per-student than Dartmouth and it shows in how much Williams can shower its undergraduates with opportunities. Williams offers tons of travel grants, fellowships, entrepreneurship grants, etc. at a level that is pretty unmatched by any other institution. Williams also offers a bunch of unique post-graduate opportunities, including 6-8 fully-funded Master's at Cambridge and Oxford yearly.\n3. Both Williams and Dartmouth have strong, loyal alumni networks, which I used as a proxy to determine how alumni generally felt about their undergraduate experience and what kind of recruiting opportunities generally exist.\n\nAll-in-all, your criteria will vary, and I'll reiterate that it's important to identify what's most important to you before you split hairs between the two. Both will offer you a tremendous education, and while I would never trade my time at Williams for time at Dartmouth, if I had ended up at the latter, I know I would've had a great time as well. Best of luck, and please let me know if I can answer any additional questions!",

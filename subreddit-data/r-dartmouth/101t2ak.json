I wanted to ask on validity on such statements and how the college is to transfers. General facts or anecdotes would be extremely helpful",

            "comment": "Transfers are rare but I've never heard of anyone saying anything negative about transfers. If anything it's impressive to get in as a transfer as the acceptance rate is so low. The part about the walk is fairly accurate, though depending on which parts of campus it could be a little more. 4000 students is relatively small compared to a lot of colleges, but that is mostly about perspective. Still feels like there's tons of college students around when you're on campus",

I\u2019m coming from a commuter school so like the essence of school spirit isn\u2019t really a thing so I was wondering since Dartmouth is so isolated there\u2019s a great sense of school spirit. And branching off how easy was it to become integrated to the community here? Again, coming from a Commuter School, so like there isn\u2019t really a community which makes the school seem really lonely.",

I'm fairly introverted so I didn't get nearly as involved in the social scene as many others, but there's tons of clubs and such which are a great way to meet new people. Dartmouth Outing Club is fantastic if you're outdoorsy, I also did intramural hockey one winter which was a ton of fun. Greek life is also big in the social scene, though that could be a bit more difficult as a transfer I'm not sure. If you're interested you could likely rush with the sophomores I'd guess, and even if you aren't affiliated most parties are open to anyone with a Dartmouth ID",

Again, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re studying so if you were studying hard STEM for an example, maybe UCL is the better choice. Secondly, the models within the US with Liberal Arts and the UK\u2019s model of honing your knowledge in a specific area are both great; however, I personally gravitate towards the model of the UK. No difference between urban and rural with the schools we are talking about, both are good enough that companies will trek to Hanover to recruit Dartmouth students. I can\u2019t answer how burnt out students feel since I\u2019ve never experienced something like that. I\u2019m one of both support and disdain of the Liberal Arts system. I see it\u2019s benefits but also its costs are something that are unique only to US student. I would imagine Dartmouth is going to be more competitive for some clubs but generally don\u2019t think Dartmouth is too pre-professional.",

Secondly, if your interest is in Film then being in the city is invaluable. I\u2019m transferring from a school which had a very large population of students involved in film, and this is chiefly because they were in the city, and so they were given many opportunities to work with various studios on various things. Again, UCL is is in London so that\u2019s a big consideration. I think that 3 internships would be possible through Dartmouth accounting for the fact that you are to attend classes for 3 quarters.",

You are light on work experience.  1 year of full time work experience generally is not quite enough to convince top b schools that you have a clear reason for why you should be going to school or that you're going to get the most out of the experience.  You really need more, and more interesting, professional experience to counteract your GPA.  \n\n2. GRE of 320 would not eliminate you but it's also not going to necessarily make you stand out.\n\n3. I'm assuming you are international, maybe based out of Asia?  I'd see this as a plus from a story standpoint, especially at a school like Tuck, however you'll have to have really good stats as the school can't as easily gauge your academic background unless you went to top/really well known university wherever you are coming from and they are going to penalize you for having a low undergraduate GPA and relative lack of work experience.\n\n4. Wherever you need to apply you need to have a clearly articulated reason for why you are going to b school and what you are looking to get out of the experience.  Lumping all the Ivy League schools together in your other post suggests to me that you aren't clearly able to articulate why you'd want to go to a specific school and if that doesn't come through in the application it's not going to do you any favors.",

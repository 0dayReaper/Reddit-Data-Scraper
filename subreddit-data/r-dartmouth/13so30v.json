    "postText": "Hey. I\u2019m a rising Freshman in high school right now and after visiting Dartmouth, I loved it. I just had a few questions:\n\n1: How is Dartmouths connection to Wall Street + IB? How is it in the business market in general?\n\n2: Since Dartmouth has no business degree, what degree do these people pursue commonly?\n\n3: What extracurriculars did you guys do to get accepted into Dartmouth? SAT/ACT score? (I live in Cali)\n\n4: What are some steps I should take to work towards Dartmouth? Should I talk to some alumni (I know a few people)?",

Just be high level in the ECs you like that follow your major, get a 1540+ \n4. just take hard classes at school and get As, while spending your time outside of it getting your ECs as good as possible",

If studying for the SAT is going to take up too much of your bandwidth, it's not worth it (I didn't worry about going from a 1480 to 1520 and instead nailed down my ECs; I got awards that were worth far more than a 40 point increase. Once you clear the bar for academic rigor, it's all about who you are, what you've done, and what you want to do) \n\nEdit: I applied as a STEM major (bio)",

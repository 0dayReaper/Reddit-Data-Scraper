While it is super stressful because we learn an entire semester\u2019s worth of content in 9 weeks, we also only take 3 classes per term. That means finals only consist of 3 subjects, which is so much better than 4-5 mf finals. On the other hand, a byproduct of the quarter system is that we have really small class sizes. As such, you get so much attention from the prof and can meet with them whenever. The only time I didn\u2019t feel like this was the case was during covid year, and that\u2019s the one time I didn\u2019t do well at the school!",

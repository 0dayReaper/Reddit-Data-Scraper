    "postText": "I'm a senior year high school student from Uzbekistan ( which shares borders with Afghanistan, Kazakhstan and some others).\nI checked the Instagram account of Dartmouth and whatever website I saw to see if there is a single person from my country studying at Dartmouth. I found 0, like literally. I found 0 people from neighbouring countries (Afghanistan, Kazakhstan). I have seen people from Kazakhstan studying at top unis like MIT, Stanford, most Ivies, but I haven't seen ONE at Dartmouth. I haven't done any scientific research, internship or something like that. Got 1440 in August sat but CB then took it away and delayed for 4 weeks yesterday. \nIs it worth applying to Dartmouth College ED as an international applicant from Uzbekistan, and what are the cons and pros of applying from here.\nPut UPVOTE so more people can give their opinions.",

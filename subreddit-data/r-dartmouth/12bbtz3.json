Like u/biggreen10 said, the pre-med courses aren't easy and that's especially true of the chem classes. The thing that Dartmouth easily has going for it w/r to UC Berkeley and USC is class size. While the chem classes are really difficult, your classes at Dartmouth won't be more than 120, so you are easily able to get time with professors and TAs if you're struggling with concepts or study habits",

I can obviously only speak in regards to Cal for academics but I can at least tell you the differences culturally.\n\nOut of those 3 choices I definitely would lean towards Berkeley or Dartmouth. USC isn\u2019t worth the insane amount of money to go there and you\u2019ll get better opportunities at Cal or Dartmouth.",

            "comment": "Funny enough, I am from STL and have experienced both Washu and Dartmouth first hand.\n\nLiving- Washu will always rank higher in terms of comfort. For god\u2019s sake, they give their students memory foam mattresses\u2026 Dartmouth\u2019s living quarters are kinda shitty, especially the older dorms. \n\nGreek life- I don\u2019t really think Washu has anything really unique. I was talking about greek like with my friend there the other day, and apparently they have lists to get into frat. That\u2019s already a huge diff from Dartmouth, where you can walk into any frat whenever and be welcomed. Due to the physical isolation, the greek life on campus is really really big, and as such, so is alcohol. I personally don\u2019t drink much and appreciate that I am never forced into doing it. However, sometimes it gets a bit much so I spend the night with friends inside.  \n\nCommunity- You really will never find a Dartmouth community easily elsewhere. Everyone here is so so so nice and looks to help each other, even if its not going to benefit them. And frankly, the small class sizes are insanely helpful. Like I always just brushed it off during admissions but holy crap, I cannot survive stem without being able to talk to the prof and ask them questions. \n\nAccessibility- You don\u2019t really need a car, but yea Dartmouth is kinda isolating without one. Whenever you do get to leave the town, it high key feels like a treat. However, don\u2019t let this deceive you. Most people only really leave the town in order to eat out or go to Boston. For Washu, this isn\u2019t as big of an issue. You have the Delmar Loop nearby so there\u2019s a bunch of night life right at your door step. \n\nOverall, Dartmouth is pretty isolating, but not necessarily in a bad way. The thing that keeps us away from inner city night life, also gives us many other things to do, including star gazing, kayaking, sailing, ice skating, snowboarding, and hiking. If you\u2019re used to a city life and want to continue it, I would stick with Washu. It\u2019s a respectable and honestly really beautiful place. However, Dartmouth has brought me out of my comfort zone multiple times in ways I cannot imagine. (Also the air quality is insanely good up here).",

I wrote a lot of my mini essays on embracing discomfort and moving out of my comfort zone. This really helped me solidify that decision - on the very off chance that I match with an Ivy League.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s isolated if you like a city nightlife but if you truly need city life, Boston is a 2 hour drive away and plenty of people drive there for the weekend. People find other things to do in Hanover though. There\u2019s a reason why we have so many frats and sororities. In general if you are outdoorsy there is a huge community with the DOC too and there do trips all over NH if that\u2019s what you\u2019d consider going out. There are definitely people who hate the location but most people I know embrace it as a way to get closer with classmates. You are still pretty close to all the essentials like Target and Walmart, it\u2019s just there\u2019s not a lot of clubs or bars to go to nearby.",

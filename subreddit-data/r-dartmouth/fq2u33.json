    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI was admitted to Dartmouth yesterday for the Class of 2024 and I have some questions for pre-med students. \n\n\\-I was also admitted to UT Plan II Honors, which is about 50k/year less than Dartmouth. For pre-med, is Dartmouth worth it money-wise? What would I be paying for? Would I be better off saving for medical school? \n\n\\-How has Dartmouth helped you with medical school admissions? At my state school, I'd be in a program of 176 kids, so I would get the small community feeling at a fraction of the price. \n\n\\-How hard is it to get an A in Dartmouth pre-med classes? Ik that the program is notorious for weeding out pre-meds, and as of right now, I know that I want to attend medical school for sure. \n\n\\-Are there any regrets/disadvantages of going to Dartmouth for pre-med? (Too hard, the quarterly system is difficult, hard to maintain high GPA, etc....)\n\n\\-Why did you choose Dartmouth?",

            "comment": "Honestly, if you're going to UT and paying 50K less, that is pretty compelling. Dartmouth has great classes for pre-med, but at least in my experience the Chemistry classes are much more difficult than you find other places. I was pre-med until I got another low grade in Orgo II, at which point I paused that plan and decided that if I still wanted to do it, I'd do a post-bach. \n\nDuring that time, I also helped my friends in their SUNY school's chem, bio, and math courses. All of those were FAR easier, and I'm fairly confident that had I gone there, I'd have stuck with pre-med and applied to med school.",

            "comment": "Speaking as a recent grad and someone who got into med school this year, if you're going to be a gunner, go be a gunner at UT. It's cheaper, you'll probably get to focus more on just knocking out pre-med pre-reqs, and odds are you'll do better, and you probably get more insight into TMDSAS. You'll be surrounded by people who all want the same thing, which is a great support system, but can also breed competition.\n\nDartmouth gives you the opportunity to branch out and explore other things that round you out as a human being like how humanities and art intersect in medicine, getting involved in the Upper Valley community, and finding connections to other fields that give you a unique perspective as an applicant. You won't have to be a bio major or neuro major to succeed. In addition, you can take advantage of its UG research opportunities (paid!), incredible alumni network, and easily obtained experience in a Trauma I hospital or clinical setting without much competition. The quarter system has pros and cons. \n\nIf being a traditional applicant is something that is important to you, UT might be a better fit. At Dartmouth, it's really common to take 1-3 years off before applying to medical school. I took one. I didn't know coming into college that I wanted to go to medical school, and I picked Dartmouth because of the freedom it gave me to explore my options and to consider the ethical implications of my career paths. Along the way, I had almost too many people giving me advice about how to do pre-med correctly, to the point where I, being the cynic I am, stopped going to advising for anything other than emotional support until I started my application cycle. It takes Liberal Arts very seriously. \n\nAlso, I want to dispel the myth of the weed out classes--these courses are HARD no matter where you go, but at nowhere is any professor actively plotting to weed students out of medicine. You weed yourself out. Don't blame the profs who are just doing their jobs. As for getting As, well, you don't need to be Phi Beta Kappa to get into a really good medical school. Med schools these days are more and more about fit and about who you are in the clinic. With Step 1 being P/F now, we don't know what trickle down effects there will be.",

I want college to be a time where I explore myself and figure out my interests while preparing for a successful career. However, I do want to be admitted to a medical school in the end. Thank you for helping me out! I think Dartmouth is a great fit for me now, especially since it is not as cut and dry \"pre-med\" as other schools. Now I just need to worry about costs as I can do liberal arts at UT and at Dartmouth. The liberal arts program is why I was going to UT to begin with and it is why I applied to Dartmouth.",

            "comment": "I applied Early Decision to Dartmouth but had previously been admitted to UT Austin\u2019s Liberal Arts Honors Program. My family had paid in to Texas Tomorrow, so there were even larger financial advantages to attending that school.\n\nWhat drew me to Dartmouth was the community, the bright and engaged future leaders I\u2019d meet who would push me to be my best, the faculty who would take me under their wing. \n\nI\u2019m also on the pre-Medical track and am applying this cycle. I\u2019ll be completing a Master\u2019s degree during my gap year. More than 80% of those who apply to medical school with a Dartmouth degree score an acceptance on their first go. That\u2019s nearly double the national average. I majored in Linguistics and minored in Chemistry, and I studied abroad twice. I completed all pre-Medical course requirements by the end of my sophomore year and had no trouble doubling up with laboratories. Courses are stimulating but not overwhelming. You\u2019ll receive plenty of support from peers, advisors, TAs (and the Teaching Science Fellows) and faculty. There is no toxic pre-Medical culture at Dartmouth comparable to anything I\u2019ve heard described elsewhere. You\u2019ll find research mentors, internships, etc. that will enrich you and enhance your application.\n\nI\u2019ve TA\u2019d General and Organic Chemistry, as well as Cell Biology and some non-science courses, so if I can be at help at any point, let me know.",

I don't know a lot about the UT schools, but in my experience, the professors at Dartmouth are there to teach, while professors at Pitt are there to do research. I've been able to learn a ton in all my classes and they've been crazy accessible for both office hours. You're also paying for incredible opportunities for undergraduate research. If you've never done research before, there are several formal internships that can help you get started (I was a Women in Science Project intern this year, for example), but I also got offers to work in labs just by emailing profs. You're paying for Ivy name brand too - not a huge factor, but certainly something I considered. \n\nI've taken one premed class so far: chem 5 (which is general chemistry 1). I never took AP chemistry in highschool, and my AP bio teacher was antivaxx if that gives you any indication of the science quality of my highschool. I poured a ton of work into that class, and by a ton, I mean that during the week, all time I wasn't actively doing something else (class, research, clubs, homework for other classes), I was studying chemistry. I still got to hang out with my friends and have fun, but chem was a huge time commitment. If you've taken it before, you definitely won't have to spend as much time as me, but it'll still be a lot of work. \n\nSo far, my only regret about Dartmouth is the language requirement. I  decided to take a language I had never studied in highschool, and it's  hurt my GPA, though that isn't the experience of most students. Just something to keep in mind! Also, as someone who came into Dartmouth strongly premed and definitely a STEM major, liberal arts is something that I actually liked because it forced me to take classes that aren't STEM - I'm going to be a bio major, WGSS minor, and I won't have to take a gap year. However, this took a lot of careful Dplanning, and I know most premeds here are taking at least one gap year. Definitely something for you to consider. \n\nI chose Dartmouth because of the culture (not cutrhroat for  premeds like many schools are), classes, and research. Besides language, I have no regrets, and I'm really glad I chose Dartmouth. Best of luck with your decision!",

But ik that there is no such thing as \"easy\" in the medical field, especially when the alternative is a state flagship like ut. the real distinguishing factor is deciding whether the extra money is worth it. im glad you love dartmouth.",

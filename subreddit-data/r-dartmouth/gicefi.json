There's no secret sauce in Math 3; you and your classmates are incredibly intelligent and everyone has trouble with Math 8 because it is an intentionally difficult weedout course.  Just go for Math 8 or 11 and know that your best shot will be cooperative studying with your peers and putting in the time with profs in office hours",

Also, even if you know the material, the tests can be freakishly hard and you'll be with premeds, engineering students and a ton of people trying to recreate their GPA in high school, so if you mess up, you'll get screwed over by the curve. If you want an easier class, there's wayyyy better options out there.",

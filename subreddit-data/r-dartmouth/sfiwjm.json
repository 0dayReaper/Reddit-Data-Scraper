            "comment": "BE is the AB degree plus several extra courses (9 I believe). If you are intending to work in engineering this is the degree most employers will want to see as it is what has ABET accreditation.\nI can't speak to financial aid during the 5th year but can say if you plan courses out early it is achievable to fit everything into 4 years.",

But it acts as its own grad schools for MS, MEM (Master of Engineering Management) and PhD programs. They just finished a huge expansion (more than doubling the size of their building) including a new building focused on energy. The CS department is also now going to be colocating with the engineering department. I have both an undergrad and grad degree from Thayer - its a great program all around. PM or reply with specific questions.",

I did take a lot of the science and math prereqs because I was pre-med when I entered college. So I ended up taking 5 years to do the BE and then stayed for an extra year and did the MEM.",

But for most attending Dartmouth, AP classes and dual enrollments prior to joining plus smart course selection can make graduation possible in 4. You do get aid if you stay for year five.",

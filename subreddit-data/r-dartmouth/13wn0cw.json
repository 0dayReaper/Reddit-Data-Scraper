They have amazing food, but it comes at a premium, and one designed more for permanent residents of Hanover. Take one of the busses down to the price chopper in Lebanon (either leb or west leb). Last I knew they were all open 24 hours a day. Reasonable prices, and no sales tax because NH! Shaws in west leb is a bit more expensive (only slightly) but they do offer a larger selection of prepared food which is either good cold or only needs a microwave.\n\nHope this helps!",

They are more than happy to take your money at a premium to \"support local farms\". Go to the Norwich Farmer's Market instead and actually support them.",

There's the Saturday Norwich Farmer's Market, which has tons of vendors and vegetables. They usually start a similar smaller market in Hanover on the green at some point in the summer.",

Also, you need a $25/year membership. Its worth the membership fee, honestly.\n\nAlso, not sure if you know this but you can get eggs, bread, cereals, milk etc lots of groceries from the basement in Dick\u2019s house. You\u2019ll find stuff in the pantry and refrigerator. Free to take. https://students.dartmouth.edu/health-service/about/health-service-food-shelf",

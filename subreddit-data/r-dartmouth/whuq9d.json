Grad programs especially in STEM are HIGHLY competitive. Joining a lab can only benefit you, if anything you may learn that research isn't for you and you can move onto something else and have more time to specialize in whatever it may be sooner rather than later. \nIn short, try it out. \ud83d\udc4d",

Typically undergrad research assistant do a minimum of ten hours a week in lab. You can do more so long as you ask the graduate student or postdoc if they'd be alright with that. In most cases they would be happy to have you do more, but of course that's going to depend on where they are in their projects. It's also good to note that priority will go to the undergrad thesis students as they will be given more responsibility to either assist in depth or take on their own research project. So if that's something you want to do you can either get your foot in the door sooner or take a laboratory research thesis course. Where I went to undergrad those were usually reserved for junior or senior undergrads. However, if you've been there for a while and do a great job you can ask for more responsibility and you might be able to get your own project before your third year, granted this is under exceptional circumstances.",

            "comment": "You definitely can - just be aware of your time constraints in this new environment. As someone who worked with about a dozen Dartmouth undergrads in a research lab over the years, the biggest problem was that a freshman would come in thinking they could do it all at Dartmouth - classes, social, research, extracurriculars. Then fast-forward past the two months of necessary bench chaperoning, and I'd often find they flamed out as they realized they were WAY over-extended, and then either quit or asked to come in just once a week (which is the same as quitting, TBH). It happened enough times that I eventually decided only take sophomores or older as it's in your second year that you really begin to figure out what you are capable of doing.",

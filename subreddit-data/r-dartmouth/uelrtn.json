    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm interested in studying cs, and I had a few questions.\n\n1. What is startup culture at Dartmouth like? I've heard a lot of great things about it.\n2. Where do students normally tend to go after graduating? What kinds of companies/grad schools?\n3. How prominent is doing undergrad research? And how easy is it to get involved?\n4. What other things are important to take into consideration when choosing Dartmouth for CS?\n\nThank you so much!\n\n(if it helps, I'm currently choosing between dartmouth and williams)",

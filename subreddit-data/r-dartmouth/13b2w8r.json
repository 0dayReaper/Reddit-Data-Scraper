    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm an incoming Dartmouth student looking for some advice on housing options in Hanover. I was wondering if any of you have experience sharing an apartment with friends without being on the lease. Is this a common practice among students? Are there any potential legal or financial issues to consider?\n\nAdditionally, I'm on a tight budget and I'm looking for the cheapest value-for-money housing options in Hanover. I've heard that living off-campus can be more affordable, but I'm not sure where to start looking. Are there any specific neighborhoods or apartment complexes that offer good deals? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance for your help",

            "comment": "It's very common because Hanover zoning laws only allow 3 unrelated people to live in the same unit. To get around this, landlords rent out 4+ bedroom properties, but only put 3 people on the lease. The legal/financial issues to consider are that you are not a legal resident, the landlord can always claim they never gave permission for you to live there, and you don't have the rights afforded to you by the lease.",

Most graduate students that I know (including me) live in Lebanon/West Lebanon/Hartford/Hartland/White River Junction and drive to campus. It's possible, though, especially with roommates, but you kind of just have to get lucky or know someone. Good luck, though!",

Will def echo that living in WRJ, Lebanon, etc is cheaper than in Hanover and gives you more options. Summit is about as expensive as being on campus, so idk if it\u2019s worth looking into. You may also want to look into being a Resident Fellow for the undergrad housing system - you live in a dorm and work with UGAs (RAs) on programming and housing stuff, but in return you get a stipend and I think meal plan covered. My only experience with that is from the undergrad side though so I could be wrong about that being less expensive for grad students.",

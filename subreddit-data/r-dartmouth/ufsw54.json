    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m an admitted student who\u2019s most probably to Darty. So basically I\u2019m working on a tech startup in San Diego (I\u2019m from India tho, the rest of my team\u2019s in SD). I was wondering if Dartmouth has resources to further my goals, help me develop as an entrepreneur, secure funding, build relevant networks and the like. \n\nBasically, is there is a good entrepreneurial community working on tech stuff at Dartmouth, and are there ample opportunities for me to progress through this place? Tbh I\u2019m a bit concerned cuz it\u2019s pretty isolated.",

    "postText": "I applied on the ED to Dartmouth, filled the Common App and this form they provide for international applicants who can't afford sending the CSS profile. I thought I did everything right, my information was marked as \"received\" on their application portal, but a few days ago I came to the realization that I totally forgot to send the parent's tax report. I don't know how, but it completely slipped my mind at that time. Now that it's far past ED deadline, I don't know whether I should try to reach out to the financial aid office and provide them the tax report now, or wait until some miracle happens and they ask me about the missing documents.",

In episode 9 there\u2019s a thing about grocery store cakes and they wanted to put swear words on it, but this particular grocery store wouldn\u2019t. One of the characters asked where she got it. \u201cStop n shop\u201d. The other character says something like \u201cyou should have gone to price chopper, they don\u2019t give a shit\u201d. Spot on. My wife (also alum) and I laughed hysterically.\n\nEdit chopped to chopper. Damn autocorrect",

    "postText": "I was recently admitted to Dartmouth's class of 2027. On my common app, I listed that I was planning on taking Spanish 3 online, but as of now, I have not yet started this course. I spoke with my guidance counselor who informed me that he never listed Spanish 3 as a course that I would be taking this year when he sent my transcript to Dartmouth. Do you guys think I need to finish this course? Would I get rescinded if I didn't? FYI: I planned on taking this class IN ADDITION to my course load at my school. It is not a substitution for an in-person class at school.\n\nBtw, I emailed the admissions office and received a pretty vague answer that did not directly answer my question. It just stated that the admissions committee will review my final transcript to ensure that my academic record has not changed significantly compared to my academic record when I was offered admission to the school.",

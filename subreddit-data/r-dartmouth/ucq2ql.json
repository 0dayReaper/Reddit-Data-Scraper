    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI am an incoming Dartmouth Master program student. I am looking into housing options at this moment.\n\nThe summit on juniper is an option and I believe undergrad students have already moved into the apartment this spring. \n\nIt\u2019s a brand new apartment with nice alarm ties. However, there are some concerns I have:\n\n1. How much is the electric bill? I know that there is a 35 dollars credit per person. But this apartment building uses individual water heater to generate heated water. I have seen similar ones in nyc and monthly electric bill can be up to 400 bucks for a regular two bedrooms.( bill from a traditional central boiler apartment is around 100 bucks for the same tenants)\n\n\n2. How is the noise insulation? I heard the wall is super thin and ppl can hear conversation from the other apartment.\n\n3. How bad is the smell? The new construction makes me dizzy and I am not sure how other ppl feel when moving in.\n\n4. Open-ended question: what other problem did you encounter?\n\nThanks for the help!",

Housing here is at an all time high in demand and the college is not going to help you at all. They do not care about graduate students. If you have the cash to swing it and really want to come here then by all means. Otherwise, I'd sincerely consider how badly you want to come to Dartmouth.",

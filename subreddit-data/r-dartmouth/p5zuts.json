            "comment": "If you're eligible for math 11, you're already very good at math and you have the capability of doing well. The biggest issue for freshmen taking math 11 is that they're not used to the pace of the Dartmouth quarter system.\n\nThe biggest piece of advice for any math class is to make sure you keep on top of the work. If you fall behind, you're going to feel like a fish out of water in the next class because everything builds on top of the last thing you learned. Everyone has a different strategy to make sure they keep on top of the work, so it'll be a lot of trial and error at the beginning. My strategy (which many would consider overkill and it prob was, but I got straight A's in math classes) is as follows. Before the class, I would read the section of the textbook that we would cover that day, taking notes on it. Then I would come to class and take detailed notes. After that, I would make flashcards of any important definitions or theorems we covered in class which I would then drill over time. I then did the weekly homework and any practice problems that were assigned. I think the most important thing is to do the practice problems (and practice exams if your prof gives them) since math is something that you really get better at with practice.",

I thought having only three courses meant I was chilling and could just do work late at night like in high school. Boy was I wrong. Math 8 said put some specc on it",

Went at my own pace and ended up with a strong GPA and rarely felt terribly overworked. My advice is to take your time - you can keep an excel spreadsheet of your planned courses for all four years to make sure you\u2019re not falling behind your intended major and/or minor.\n\nEdit: Specifically, meant I agreed with the first part. Didn\u2019t really read the whole thing lol",

Me and my friends in the class our freshman fall would race to see who could complete practice problems faster. The pace with the Dartmouth quarter system is fast, but manageable if you put in the work. Towards the end of the class (the last two weeks), it gets quite tough; using supplementary practice problems and tutorials helped me a lot.",

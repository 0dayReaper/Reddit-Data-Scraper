It is still a Biology major though, NOT a genetics major inside the Bio dept. Since anatomy/physiology is also within the Bio department, you could maybe pick Human Bio as a concentration so you can incorporate some anatomy classes that way. You can\u2019t have more than one concentration inside the major. If you have any interest in psych/neuro, you might consider that or anthropology as a minor since those seem to be the closest to your interests.",

If you still can\u2019t find anything that meets your needs then I hate to say it but please reconsider exactly why you want to attend Dartmouth. The small departments with broad majors are intentional to promote a liberal arts education. If you are looking for highly specialized study it will be hard to do that here since the school is basically designed around broadening your scope of knowledge.",

For OP's reference, normal engineering would fine. The biomedical engineering major is essentially for pre-med engineers. You can absolutely do a genetic or protein engineering concentration through the engineering sciences major without the extra pain from a biomedical engineering major",

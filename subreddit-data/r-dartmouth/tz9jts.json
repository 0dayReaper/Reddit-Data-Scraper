    "postText": "Really torn between these 2 options for CS. Cornell seems to have an objectively better program, at least in the eyes of employers with Dartmouth being somewhat of a no-name outside of the biggest tech companies and far less recognizable than Cornell. That and Cornell is much closer to home to the point where on long weekends I could come home; due to the distance of Dartmouth I realistically could only come in for summer and Christmas. Outside of that though I prefer Dartmouth in almost every other aspect, from what I've seen the campus is much nicer than Cornell, there's more to do to avoid boredom, it's $5k cheaper per year, and student life seems miles better at Dartmouth. Haven't visited the campus in person yet but I've done virtual tours and will be heading down at the end of this month for Discover Dartmouth.",

Any hiring manager that has formed an opinion on Cornell will also be very familiar with Dartmouth. \n\nWRT program strength, I'd say it really probably doesn't matter nearly as much as any interships/etc that you do, with the _possible_ exception of the case where you want to go straight from undergrad into grad school. But otherwise I think you'll be fine.",

Obv biased as a Dartmouth CS student but there is practically no difference between the two in terms of hiring, or even grad school admissions. \n\nIn a lot of ways I'd pick for your research interests, of which Cornell probably has more diversity if you're not sure. But if you're interested in health computing, mobile computing, or security, there are lots of options at Dartmouth. Plus Dartmouth cares a LOT about undergraduate research - not true everywhere (can't speak for Cornell specifically).",

Dartmouth is a smaller department, still with great and accomplished profs btw, but less researchers. We do have coverage overall in most major fields just not most subfields. So yes there are several ML profs but there might not be one that is an expert at a specific subfield of ML. This might affect you as a grad student a lot if you are needing a PI who has strength in the topic you are writing your dissertation about.

If I am really not into partying, would Dartmouth's prominent greek/social life be a downside for me?\n\nThanks so much!",

Everyone who goes here displays some level of \"crunchiness\" and is, generally, really friendly and easy to talk to. Coming from high-school, that was one aspect that really surprised me about the student body. \n\nAs for partying goes, yes, there is an eminent Greek life to those who seek it out (esp given how everything in Hanover/Upper Valley closes before 9pm and the overall lack of nightlife alternatives). However, with this, there are SO many different types of clubs and social activities you can immerse yourself with aside from drinking! Collis game/bingo nights with prizes, hanging out by the river, going to movie showings at the Hop, and house dinners are but a few of the many, many fun things you can do without drinking/immersing yourself into the party atmosphere. \n\n As someone who doesn't party or drink, I found that being able to find a group of likeminded or just respectful friends also really helped me feel comfortable and seldom left out. Joining clubs or extracurriculars are also another great way to socialize and meet new people without partying or alcohol. \n\nJust be yourself and remember that it's perfectly healthy to have boundaries and have them respected :)",

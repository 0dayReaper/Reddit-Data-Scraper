In reality, though, your high school classes and ec\u2019s should suggest what major to apply as - applying for a major that might be regarded as easy to get into (hospitality) with no experience or extracurriculars in that field would probably have a lower chance of acceptance than applying as a major in a field your classes and ecs demonstrate interest in.",

What value do you believe you can add to the Dartmouth community?  I'd be much more worried about being able to clearly articulate those points than applying to the 'easiest' major.  To echo other's points the major does NOT matter.  Showing that you genuinely have something to offer and can show why you would matriculate if lucky enough to be accepted does.",

You will have to show to Admissions that you are an excellent student capable of studying and exploring academically at Dartmouth. What you intend on majoring (on the common app) doesn't matter because your interests and course plans will likely change while attending Dartmouth.",

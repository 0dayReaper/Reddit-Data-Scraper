    "postText": "Hey everyone, I've been looking into majoring with econ, but I want to pursue a pre-med track on the side, so I was wondering in what order I should take my pre-med courses and which ones in particular. \n\nI do have a background in Bio from AP Bio, but not much for Chem besides the basic course in HS, so I was pretty worried about gen chem and orgo later on. Layuplist has been broken for me (can't make a new account, see layups) so I haven't been able to check how the classes are beyond the medians for them. I'd appreciate any advice from students on the pre-med track and especially those who are going for/have done a humanities major.",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re committed to premed, unless you\u2019re genuinely interested in Econ, I would recommend doing an easier major bc it will def be a really hectic schedule to fit in premed classes with Econ ones which are all fairly rigorous. In terms of timing, it depends if you want to go straight through or take gap years, but I\u2019d generally recommend doing gen chem as a freshman and orgo/physics as a sophomore or junior, with bio classes wherever you can fit them in.",

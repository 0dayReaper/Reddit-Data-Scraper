I got a good $50 puffer from Burlington and would layer (which you will want bc the buildings are well insulated and heated). You won't be outside much when it's super cold I less you're playing a winter sport, but even then the team will buy you gear lmao. I also would put on fleece or compression leggings under my jeans when it got very cold. Do remember it gets so hot in the spring and summer!\n\nSeveral ppl got their Canada goose jackets stolen freshman year lmao",

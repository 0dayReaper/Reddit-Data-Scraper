            "comment": "Recent MALS grad here. I loved my time in the program. The classes are small and filled with intensely dedicated students from all sorts of geographical, sociological, and career backgrounds. The professors, for the most part, run great classes that center on discussion. They do a great job of connecting with students and helping them take the course material where they want to go with it. \n\nDartmouth as a whole is definitely geared towards undergrads. I lived in Hanover as a Resident Fellow in one of the undergrad dorms (free housing and meal plan) and at times it got lonely, but I was also there during Covid which certainly didn't help. There is a community to an extent, but grad students are pretty scattered around the Upper Valley. I would say my biggest criticism of MALS (and the Guarini School as a whole) is a lack of concerted effort to build the type of community found in the other three graduate schools at Dartmouth.\n\nFeel free to DM me with more questions!",

I\u2019m a high school English teacher so the program made a lot of sense for me. \n\nI guess I would ask what you plan to do with the PhD? The creative writing classes and teachers are good, but I don\u2019t know how it would prepare you for a PhD program; that track is more for people who are looking to jumpstart their writing careers.",

I was an English major in undergrad and feel that the cultural studies track helped me to round out my analytical writing skills. I took a couple of creative writing classes because I teach creative writing courses, but if you\u2019re interested in pursuing a literature degree then I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.",

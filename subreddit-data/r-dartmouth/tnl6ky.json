    "postText": "Hi there. Incoming freshman here. I am a passionate physicist who will be majoring in Physics. But I have to enter job field right after graduation to support my family's finances. So, I am thinking of majoring in CS (I am interested in CS too). How difficult is physics and CS double major? Also, I am fascinated by the MEM degree. Is Physics + CS + MEM doable?",

            "comment": "I'm pretty sure that the MEM program is strictly a graduate program, so I don't think you'll be able to do it concurrently with your undergrad. \n\nHave you considered studying Engineering? I came in to Dartmouth very passionate about physics, but I found that as I progressed through the curriculum at a college level it became more and more abstract, and I found that what I had really liked about studying physics in high school is how much it had explained the world around me. For me engineering really picked up that progression. \n\nEngineering and Physics or Engineering and CS are both very compatible degrees with a lot of overlap in course requirements. I think Physics and CS are probably a little less so, but still doable. \n\nAlso, within Engineering you can definitely pursue a more CS heavy course of study if you want.",

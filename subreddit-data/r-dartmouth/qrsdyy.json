    "postText": " First time poster and I know I don't go attend Dartmouth but I figured this was the best place to ask about Ivy League schools. I'm a senior about to graduate from a Midwest university and was looking to be part of psychology research labs around the country during my gap year/s before applying to grad schools. While I have an extremely high Psych GPA (practically a 4.0 if we ignore one class during the pandemic), I have a lower overall GPA because of just terrible life circumstances and then recognizing I don't want to go into medicine anymore (3.23 rn) and the only research experience I have is the independent research study I'm conducting during my senior year, acting as PI and first author. I can get strong letter of recs and I have been emailing professors all over the country asking for positions and informational interviews and have gotten responses that tell me to ask again in the Spring, but also open to discuss more.\n\nI'd like to think I'm quite personable and educated but I'm afraid to apply to any positions at any of the prestigious schools because I feel like they'd just look at my surface level information and drop me from consideration, compared to the other applicants who've probably done much more. I just want to be given a chance but I don't know how the psych department at these schools is about accepting students and how open they are to such things.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or advice in this field? I would really appreciate anything and sorry if this is not where I should be posting.",

            "comment": "Based on what you've said, you should not have any trouble finding a position. You'll have some research experience upon graduation and your GPA and UG school matters much less than you think it does when it comes to employment. All they want to know is that you have a degree, that you have some research background, and that you are interested in the work. The school you went to does not matter--other RAs came from all different institutions and we're certainly not limited to ivies, but many were from Dartmouth, which kinda makes sense because they're the biggest local student population to pull from. They may ask for GPA, but it's equally likely that they won't care. I wasn't asked for my grades and others weren't either, but some were. It seems somewhat dependent on the professor you're working for.\n\nSide note: as someone who has done research at Dartmouth, I might suggest that you broaden your psych research job search to big research institutions along the East Coast unless you are dead-set on doing research in Hanover, NH. Dartmouth has a graduate program and many professors do research, but it is a smaller school and there will be limitations on the number of spots and funds available. I'm not saying that you won't be able to find a position, but there may not be as many. Big research institutions, like Columbia (in NYC) and it's medical center, Mass General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, are huge research institutions and will have a lot more positions and funding. Again, they aren't picky about where you did your undergrad at all. Maybe consider those too? If the Upper Valley location is a big draw, then my advice doesn't stand (please ignore.)",

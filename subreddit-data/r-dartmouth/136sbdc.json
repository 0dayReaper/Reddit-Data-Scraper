You seem to be from a fairly affluent background, If I were you I would leave this resource to kids that really need it. But to answer your question you are technically a minority and there is no official income cut-off, so ideally you could apply.",

(not really recommended to put on other colleges' application though...)",

As seen on their official [website](https://admissions.dartmouth.edu/glossary-question/does-it-improve-my-chances-if-i-demonstrate-interest-visiting-calling-emailing) \u201cNo. Your completed application is all the demonstrated interest we need. We don\u2019t track visits, communications, college fairs, or web events to enhance or detract from anyone\u2019s application.\u201d I remember having mailed the admissions office about the discrepancy back when I was in the process of applying to Dartmouth and they had said that they actually don\u2019t consider demonstrated interest and what their cds was referring to was things like a well written why Dartmouth essay as a form of interest in the school.",

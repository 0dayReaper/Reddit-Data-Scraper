    "postText": "Hello! I'm an undergrad at Yale and I'll be at Dartmouth Monday 21st afternoon/ night on a solo road trip. I know it's Spring Break, but I wanted to see if \n\n1) If there's any one who'll be on campus who'd want to give me a tour? It's my first time going and I'd love to learn a bit!\n\n 2) If there's any guys willing to let me crash with them? It's just for the night. Figured I'd ask before I find an Airbnb. Feel free to reach out, I'm happy to talk!",

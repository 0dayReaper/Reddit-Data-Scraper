If you know upperclassmen, you might go to a frat.\n\nIf you're not in Greek life odds are that you know someone who is: invite parties shouldn't be an issue. Even if not, all you have to do to get into any frat on an on night is show you're Dartmouth ID so unaffiliated people go wherever they want. Clubs also have social events/parties. Off campus parties get more popular each year with your own year. Party scene is definitely dominanted by the frats I'd say.",

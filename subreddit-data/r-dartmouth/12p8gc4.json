            "comment": "As a current resident, I would recommend against it. There have been many issues beyond just the disastrous heating problems (leaving dozens of units without heat beginning in October and still not fully rectified) including extremely poor build-quality especially for how expensive it is. My roommate's gf pays less than we do for a bigger 2bd/2bth in Manhattan.\n\nRead the Google reviews to get a full account of the many issues and even legal violations that have occurred.",

If you value convenience above all else, SoJ is your place. The location is quite nice, but that's the only thing it has going for it. Scope out your options on apartment websites, dartlist, etc. before settling on cardboard, glue, and paper-thin walls.",

            "comment": "This is probably a hot take, but I honestly think people give summit too much crap. Yes they've had some rough slip ups, and haven't made some good impressions related to the heat issues, but all-in-all it's been a great place to live. The walls are definitely not super thick, but I can't really hear those in the units next to me (probably dependent on luck though). You have a built-in washer and drier, a dishwasher and electric stove top, and the place is furnished. There aren't a ton of options near Dartmouth that offer that *with* a good location. Even when the heating went out for a few weeks, we had 2 space heaters in our room and it didn't feel any different, and we got rent off for every day we were affected. I think a lot of people here don't appreciate a lot of what summit gives in comparison to a lot of other places around here, but maybe that's just me.",

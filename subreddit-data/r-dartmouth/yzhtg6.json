I've had interviews with other colleges but they were with AOs or current students so do you think alumni interviews are sort of different? And how long was it if you dont mind me asking?",

I'm not sure if alumni interviews are different from AO's or current students since I haven't had any with the latter. But all in all, i think mine went pretty good, and ive got my fingers crossed now.",

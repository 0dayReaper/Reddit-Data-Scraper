There are probably safe, reputable studios in Vermont/NH, but I don't know any off the top of my head and I haven't been to any of the APP (safepiercing.org) member studios as they're all a pretty long drive away. \n\nI visited Angelina's Roses back in 21X to change out jewelry in one of my piercings and the piercer seemed nice but only stocked brands like metal mafia and invictus which I wouldn't feel safe putting in my ears. It sounds like he went to APP conference (good for him! -- see safepiercing.org) this year though and now carries Junipurr/Neometal/Industrial Strength/Divinity Metals, so they definitely have safe jewelry options now if you ask for it. Can't speak to the skill of the piercer as I've not been pierced by him, but was a bit turned off by the jewelry brands when I went ~1.5 yrs ago. \n\nFeel free to DM if you want more info (but tbh if you live in a reasonably big city, I'd just get pierced at a reputable studio when you're at home)",

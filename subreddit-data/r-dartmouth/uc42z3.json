I am interested in biomedical research in gene technology/oncology. Also any information on the Pre-Med track at Dartmouth would be much appreciated. Thank you!!",

You can absolutely do research in one of the labs on campus either in the medical school or within the bio program or at the hospital. The options for undergrad research is a strength of the school. As for the medical track, I cannot comment on that as I do not have any experience in that area.",

Pretty much just emailed the PIs and got a spot. \nThere\u2019s not really a strict premed track but the advisors are good at letting you know what classes you need to take to meet requirements. Biology was probably the most popular major among premeds.",

            "comment": "You definitely can - just be aware of your time constraints in this new environment.  As someone who worked with about a dozen Dartmouth undergrads in a research lab over the years, the biggest problem was that a freshman would come in thinking they could do it all at Dartmouth - classes, social, research, extracurriculars.  Then fast-forward past the two months of necessary bench chaperoning, and I'd often find they flamed out as they realized they were WAY over-extended, and then either quit or asked to come in just once a week (which is the same as quitting, TBH).  It happened enough times that I eventually decided only take sophomores or older as it's in your second year that you really begin to figure out what you are capable of doing.",

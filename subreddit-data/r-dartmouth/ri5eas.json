I wouldn't necessarily recommend it (I think there's benefit to taking at least part of a fifth year), but but if you're concerned about the added tuition I wanted to say that it's perfectly possible to do both degrees in 4.",

If you want to study engineering I would recommend pursuing the BE, it is a more portable degree. \n\nWhen I said \"I don't necessarily recommend it\", I don't mean to say that I _don't_ recommend it. Just that there are arguments both for and against.\n\nIf you do both in 4 it ends up kind of looking like doing both a major and a minor in engineering. It makes your senior year pretty busy, but there's a a lot of camaraderie among the people who do it. More than half of my friends did both degrees in 4.\n\nAnother option, which is what I did, is to take a portion of a fifth year. I was enrolled in only one class for the fall and winter quarters of my fifth year, and then no classes fifth spring, and that works out to a bit less than one quarter's worth of additional tuition (or at least it did then).",

    "postText": "Hey all, \n\nI'm a super recent alumni ('22) who just wanted to drop some advice for all you incoming '26s. Feel free to take it or not. I just kind of wanted to do a brain dump/reflection of my past four years as a Dartmouth undergrad and it ended up turning into this! Each one of these tips has a personal backstory to attach based on my own experience that I didn't include, but am happy to elaborate on via DM or in the comments. \n\nAgain, this is based on my own ups and downs at Dartmouth so don't feel like you have to do these things. Just sharing some of the lessons I learned the hard way in the hopes that maybe you'll be able to avoid some of these pitfalls. \n\nBest of luck this upcoming fall and welcome to the woods! :)\n\n**How to survive a 10-week term** \n\nTake it easy academically your freshman fall. There\u2019s so much to experience in your first term at Dartmouth, from clubs, new friends and activities to the New England woods itself. Think of your year-long AP class or semester duel-enrollment and compress it into 10 weeks (sometimes more like 8 given the first week is chill and last week wraps things up), and you\u2019ve got a Dartmouth term! You\u2019ll (hopefully) get used to it within the year or figure out what works best for you, but don\u2019t feel pressured to go super hardcore academically in your first term. You have plenty of time for that. Generally, I\u2019d recommend taking a layup, and an intro course to balance out the Writing 2/3/5. \n\nIf you\u2019re feeling antsy about having a heavier course load, then do it in the winter lol\n\nDo your research about professors and classes!! Professors can really make or break a subject or class for you and in most cases unlike high school, you actually have options! You can look up every class on LayupList and search them by professor if they haven\u2019t taught the course before. There are also class reviews on the Course Assessment page over on Darthub. ALSO everyone who\u2019s not a \u201926, be sure to submit LayupList reviews!!! If you see a class is being taught by a bad/hard professor and there are better options (say, a different professor teaches in the Winter), then nothing wrong with waiting until then!\n\nAfter you\u2019ve found clubs and other interests for the term, put them all in a ranked priority list. If/when things start picking up in the term, it helps to know which commitments you can cut early on, whether that\u2019s dropping altogether or taking a break from attending. People won\u2019t take it personally and it helps as you navigate the school/life balance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to pick your major**\n\nFirst off, don\u2019t compare to peers and their supposed major declarations; they are just as clueless as you are on what that workload actually entails. At the end of the day, you only need one major and that\u2019s it. Instead, consider what sort of career path you may actually want to take and whether a double major or minor might help you reach that. Some people do it to give themselves options, while others may take a major that secures them a job and a \u201cfun\u201d major that they\u2019re passionate about, but doesn\u2019t bring in the salary they need to provide for their family. If you\u2019re really uncertain about major, ask upperclassmen what got them into their major and internship experiences that kept them on that path.\n\nReach out to the major advisor for the department if you are uncertain about the plan. The faculty advisor they give you early on may not be useful depending on your interests and you\u2019re more likely to get the answers you\u2019re looking for from multiple professors in various departments. You can find the major advisor if you google department \\[insert department name here\\] dartmouth. \n\nWhile you do need to \u201cdeclare\u201d a major and major plan by sophomore year, you can *technically* change that declaration and plan entirely up until your senior spring. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THEN TO MAKE A PLAN, but also don\u2019t panic if you end up pivoting towards the end of junior year and early senior year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to get a summer internship**\n\nStart applying for summer internships now, even if you feel under-qualified. If you have even an inkling of what you may want to pursue, then send in applications soon before you get bombarded by the Fall term. Dartmouth starting so late in September puts them at a bit of a disadvantage for freshmen recruiting and recruiting has gotten even more competitive. More than ever, this is a great time for that fancy Dartmouth brand name on your resume to carry you along with whatever crazy high school accomplishments got you into Dartmouth in the first place. \n\nIf you want a referral, try looking up companies on LinkedIn and searching which ones are Dartmouth alumni, and set up a time to chat. Do not ask for a referral until you have a conversation over the phone since that phone conversation is a good time to actually learn about the company and more specifically if you actually would be interested in working there. If the conversation goes well, then ask them for a referral afterwards.\n\nCompanies want to see your experience outside of classes. GPA is a tiny number on your resume and never comes up in interviews. We\u2019re talking research, work experiences, clubs and personal projects. Take the time that you aren\u2019t agonizing over midterms and put it into organizations that actually interest you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to take care of yourself** \n\nThis may be a bit dangerous to suggest early on, but I\u2019ll throw it out anyways: Figure out how much you actually need to stress about your GPA. If you\u2019re on the track for law school, med school or any grad school really or your dream company explicitly states in the requirements that you need a 3.75 GPA, then yeah GPA is important. For everyone else\u2026. it depends. I say this as a CS major who\u2019s gotten almost all my CS grades at below or at median and living a comfy job that grades aren\u2019t everything depending on your field. Most jobs look for a 3.0 GPA, which is a B average and for some of you high school 4.0 peoples, that might seem unthinkable. Yes you shouldn\u2019t fail your classes, but don\u2019t beat yourself up for a B+ or stress out because you failed a midterm. Basically, cut yourself some slack when it comes to GPA, it means a lot less than it did back in high school.\n\nAlso, take layups and enjoy your life. No shame in having an easy course load and making the most out of your college years actually having a life. GPA padding is a bonus and getting rid of distribs early on gives you flexibility if you end up pivoting interests midway through and need to take other major classes. \n\nTake care of your mental health.\n\nLook at any article by The D about Dartmouth\u2019s mental health resources and you\u2019ll see that they\u2019re greatly lacking. It was a huge issue in the pandemic, and even know, it\u2019s very much still an underinvested in resource, despite the numerous students who need help. Do not wait for yourself to reach breaking point, it\u2019s never worth it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to combat imposter syndrome**\n\nDartmouth is a bubble. Not to sound arrogant, but outside people who know what Dartmouth is think you\u2019re hot shit, whether it\u2019s an employer, coworkers, the general public. Dartmouth being one of the lesser known Ivys means that if the person you\u2019re talking to knows that it is an Ivy, they also know you\u2019re incredibly smart. Why else would people be paying thousands for activities, standardized tests, or even bribes (not this school but at others), to get in! If you\u2019ve made it this far, then pat yourself on the back because you done good. \n\nAsk for help!! If questions feel too \u201cdumb\u201d to ask a professor (or expose you aren\u2019t paying attention lol), then ask a floormate or someone who you somehow end up sitting next to every class. You never know if they\u2019ll end up being your best friend or future roommate after college.\n\n**How to meet some of the smartest people at Dartmouth** \n\nUnsure of how to start a conversation to your professors? Try chatting with them Week 1 wayyyy before much serious work is assigned to your class! Some good conversation starters can include what got them interested in teaching the class (or the subject itself), and what are some tips to succeed in the class. The key is establishing a relationship outside of just course material and questions and helps distinguish you outside of one of the many students who will be at office hours.\n\nReach out to professors who interest you, even if you aren\u2019t taking their class (yet). Despite Dartmouth\u2019s small size, sometimes it can be challenging to get into smaller seminar courses without junior/senior priority, so reaching out early on can help you get to the top of the waitlist if add-drop screws you over. Just search up a topic you\u2019re interested in on LayupList or ORC and they usually show who teaches the classes.\n\nTake your professor out to lunch! There\u2019s a voucher you get can to take your professor out to PINE for $50 completely covered by the college and you can get it every single term!!! Totally recommend for the free food and the good conversation; you never know who\u2019ll be writing your letter of recommendation or have an opening to conduct research later on.\n\nWant to get to know an upperclassmen better? Ask them out for a meal! It\u2019s a completely normal thing given Dartmouth\u2019s limited dining options and a good way to branch out from FOCO. Upperclassmen need to eat too and it\u2019s a good first outing to have for them to get to know you better on an individual level.",

Read your [texts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqYmmZKY4sA) (not the only method, but I found it to be very helpful) from week 1! Don't get afraid to email your professors or go to office hours if you have questions. Don't be like 3/4 of my dorm mates that would walk around like zombies during midterms because they did the minimum amount of work until then. You will burn yourself out that way.\n\nDartmouth (or really any college), is a mixture of sleep, social life, and academics. 2 of them really only can be met at any one time.",

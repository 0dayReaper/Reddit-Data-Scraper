They included a brochure/pamphlet with info for parents, and a packet of blank postcards that featured pics from around campus. Along with that letter I got a handwritten note from the admissions counselor assigned to me that included a couple of Dartmouth stickers inside. Not sure if the second one typically happens to other people who get accepted though",

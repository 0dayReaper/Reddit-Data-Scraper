I was curious about substance free housing because it seems appealing to me but I thought there might be a stigma with it or a bunch of people whose parents signed them up for it and don't really want to be substance free. Does anyone here have any thoughts on it (as someone who has done it or is an outsider)?",

I really liked sub free because my neighbors were quieter and more conscientious than the student body at large. You can still get drunk at other people's dorms, you just can't at yours, so if you're someone who likes throwing parties it won't be a good fit.",

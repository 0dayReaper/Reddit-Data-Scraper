My friend showed me hers and it presented some parts of me that weren't mentioned in my application at all, which was really. Aspects of your character that may not be represented well in an interview or through your other scholarly things would be really great. Personally, if there's anything that can show the admissions officers more positive aspects of you as a person is good. Dartmouth is really competitive, and when they say \"strongly recommended\" (like they say on the website), it's basically a requirement given just how competitive it is",

            "comment": "It's not *necessary*, but I'd strongly encourage you to get one. The rationale Dartmouth gives sounds simple enough: insight into a different side of you provided by someone close to you, not in a position of authority over you or otherwise obligated to spend time with and mentor you. But if you take a moment to think about that -- what it means -- and really think about what they're seeing with the rest of your application, you may begin to get excited about it. That Dartmouth cares about this is really a testament to its culture and values and the type of community it's trying to create: one where you and your fellow students will support and inspire each other. The peer recommendation is a chance to show that you've *done* this, or had this done for you. If that sounds serious and scary, it shouldn't. Most everyone has meaningfully helped a friend or really made a difference in their life in some way -- just by virtue of *being in their life*. This is also a cool opportunity to reflect on that aspect of connectedness and to feel reassured that you matter, who you are matters. Your peer recommender could be a sibling, friend, sports teammate, someone you practice the flute with, etc -- anyone!",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an international student from the Netherlands and I had my Dartmouth interview the 11th of March. When I asked my interviewer whether his report would reach the AO on time, he told me he was only asked by Dartmouth to interview me the week before (~4 March). Does it mean anything that Dartmouth asked an alumnus to interview me that close to the decision release date?!\n\n(Same exact story with Harvard but then one week before. I also had an interview with UPenn and Princeton)",

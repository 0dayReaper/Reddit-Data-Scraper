    "postText": "So, I applied ED to Dartmouth, and I just completed my interview. I spent a few hours prepping ahead, but the interview did not go as I expected. My fat fingers ended up incorrectly typing my phone number for the interview. But, I was able to send the correct number 5 minutes before it started, and I received the call on time (I hope my interviewer didn't see it as a big flop lol...). Anyways, my interviewer was around 80 years old, but was very enjoyable to talk to. However, the interview was much more about my interviewer attempting to appeal to my interests and telling me about Dartmouth, rather than asking me questions and getting a broader understanding of who I am. He seemed very fixated on one particular activity I did, but discussed the sport's history as opposed to the sport in my context. I would say he talked for 75% of the time, and the conversation was all about this one activity. He did end up following up directly after the interview to talk more about the history of this sport. I am happy that I was able to be interviewed by someone very passionate about this sport, but I felt as though I did not get to show anything additional that would help my application. Anyone else have a similar experience?",

It lasted about 10 minutes, and the guy seemed wholly unimpressed with me. Asked really specific, odd questions that I struggled to answer. But I still got in ED!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am admitted to the Ph.D. in ECE program at Thayer recently. However, my BS is in Computer Science, so I am wondering if I can perform well at Dartmouth due to the shift in majors. I know ECE and CS are shared fields, but I have never taken any courses in ECE before (except to Digital Devices and Microcontrollers which are categorized as CS classes in my institution).\n\nMy fields are Machine Learning and Computer Vision, so I am comfortable with taking Mathematics and Computer Science classes.\n\nIs there anyone with similar experience that can answer my concern? Thank you very much in advance!",

Didn\u2019t really struggle much during this shift because of widely available academic resources.\n\nYou\u2019ll be fine - profs, TAs, other colleagues will always help you if you need any.",

I don't have car, so I may stay near school (I guess it would be tough to commute to school during winter).  \n\n\nI will visit Dartmouth College this coming March, but just wondering!",

            "comment": "The PhD program at Thayer has very general requirements, and each student builds their own course program. ECE is just a loose grouping, not a department, and there are no requirements for someone in computing to study electronics.  If you want to, you certainly can; similarly if you want to take courses in some other area you can.  But the required courses are just:\n\n* Applied mathematics (2\u20133 courses)\n\n* Engineering sciences breadth of knowledge (2\u20133 courses)\n\n* Engineering sciences specialization (4 courses)\n\nThe breadth can be anything you are interested in.  And the specialization is what you choose relevant to your research area, not some predefined set of courses or list of courses.  And none of those are determined by the fact that you are in the ECE category.",

Some are listed [here](https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/upper-valley-rentals); you can select the distance that you want to search (biking distance, walking distance?) There's info on the ones offered by the college [here](https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/rental-property/dartmouth-rental-housing/graduate-rentals).

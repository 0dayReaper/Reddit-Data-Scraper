            "comment": "In town there are limited options\n\nSushiya has sushi but their Korean food is much better than their Japanese imo. \n\nJewel of India has pretty good american-style Indian food\n\nC&amp;A and Ramuntos do pizza, C&amp;A is a dive but really good when you're incredibly hungry hahaha. They also have wings. \n\nBase Camp has Nepalese food, pretty good and spicy but expensive. Fun ingredients though. \n\nHan fusion has good american-style Chinese food, but they haven't been open for dine in since the pandemic so idk (graduated this year fyi). \n\nImpasto (Italian) and tacos y tequila just recently opened, but they're both a bit expensive and subpar for their respective cuisines. \n\nPine is overrated. Or at least was. But if you want a nice cocktail they're the place to go. \n\nTuk Tuk makes pretty good Thai food, but I (presumably) got food poisoning there once so it's been hard to go back. \n\nWent to Molly's once, never went back. Lots of people like it and it does big groups well. \n\nUmplebeys is the best probably. A little cafe that makes bread and excellent sandwiches (their vegetarian lunch one is really good). Apparently great coffee too (I don't drink it).",

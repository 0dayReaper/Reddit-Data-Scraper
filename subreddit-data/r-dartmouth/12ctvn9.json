Getting a decision rescinded is astronomically rare, and in the event it somehow happens the applicant always has a chance to argue their case. You wouldn't just receive a letter in the mail saying you're not allowed in anymore and that's that.",

But even if you were rescinded, they would hear out your case first/you can appeal with your circumstances.",

Therefore, they\u2019re going to assume you have one. Not to say that windows won\u2019t work, but they\u2019re going to have to go out of their way to figure out things for your computer. It\u2019s just better to have a Mac. Trust. \n\nAlso, not saying that you can\u2019t do it, but be prepared to think about your majors and your plan. Because QSS is interdisciplinary, it\u2019s course intensive meaning that there might not be enough space for you to double major. That\u2019s just my experience. Most Qss minor in Cs or double\nMajor in gov/Econ only because of how much overlap there is. It\u2019s definitely possible, just not sure if it\u2019s realistic. Take classes in both though. Not telling you this to squander your dreams, just wish someone had told me this when I was a freshman",

My best suggestion is to a list of some of the internships or programs you have found, and ask about it here. I\u2019d be happy to advise on the ones I know about. \n\nWhat biggreen10 is trying to point out is that there can be a bit more effort on your end. There\u2019s a lot of Dartmouth opportunities and we can\u2019t tell you about everything if you don\u2019t give us something to work with!",

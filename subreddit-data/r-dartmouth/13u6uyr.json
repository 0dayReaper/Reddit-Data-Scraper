    "postText": "hi! i'm a rising high school junior and i am super interested in dartmouth. however, no one from my school has ever(!) committed there and i fear i may not stand out. i don't have a perfect gpa but will be top 10% and have a forte in science (especially bio and chem), which my extracurriculars display. many people have suggested reaching out to my regional admissions counselor in order to start pre-building a connection. in my e-mail, what should i mention?",

Be sure to check site for schedule first before asking that.\n\n2) Read this blog to get more good question ideas - we looked for good questions and found this great blog after the process - https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2023/03/06/the-two-most-important-letters-in-college-admission/\n\nBest of luck! Apply ED if you can and are ready. Be sure to listen to Dartmouth Admissions podcast.",

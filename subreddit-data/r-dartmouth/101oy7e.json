I'm from Tashkent, Uzbekistan btw.\n\nBack to answering your question, I would say not to submit. Although you have a perfect math score, the first thing AOs see is the 1460, not the 800. This will already shed a negative light on you.",

But i also knew my 3.9 UW comes from 10 AP classes so it's going to be considered rigorous, now familiar with A levels but that also seems to be your case. 660 from English seems a bit week, even though you are a stem major. I had a 730 from Maths and felt like it didn't look great and knew I had a 4 from AP Calc that showed my math knowledge kinda better. So if one of your A* is from English or like History then maybe that's also a good way to demonstrate your English proficiency.",

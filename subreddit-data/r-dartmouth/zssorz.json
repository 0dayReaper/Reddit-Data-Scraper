    "postText": "Hi everyone! Newly admitted '27 here :) I got an email from admissions last night asking me to send a photo with Dartmouth gear as they're putting together the Humans of Hanover (where admits' why dartmouth essays are featured) for the new issue of 3D Magazine. I was wondering if this was a generic email and everyone else got it. Dartmouth attire or gear cannot be found anywhere in my country, so I just printed the \"D\" logo with a \"class of 2027\" instead. Will this be acceptable? I'd love to represent my country and be featured on 3D! Cheers \ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf32",

I would try sending them an email letting them know that no gear is available in your country but you would still like to participate. Worst case scenario they just say \u201ctoo bad\u201d but there is a chance they will ship you a shirt or hoodie or something for you to have. Welcome to the woods!",

After quickly looking at the photos in the Humans of Hanover spread, I've seen students with no Dartmouth clothes but with a cup which has Dartmouth's logo printed on it. Or someone holding a copy of the Magazine. Or someone showing off that triangular shaped banner thingy (dunno what's it called \ud83d\ude06). I then thought I'll let em know I don't have any get BUT send em a pic with my printed D logo instead. Hope this works \ud83d\ude0a",

Do not go out of your way to buy anything, and I wouldn\u2019t hold anything either lol. Maybe the admit packet, a magazine, etc! Congrats and welcome to the woods. Let me know if you have any questions about anything!",

As you know the admissions office has closed for the holidays and I was wondering if my submission will be accepted after they open in January.\n\n2. Are the why us essays prescreened before admissions contacts admits for the Humans of Hanover spread? It seems that not all '27s received the email. Just curious \ud83d\ude0a",

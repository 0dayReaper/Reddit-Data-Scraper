Dartmouth is my dream school so I was just wondering if those who got in can share any tips about others that did not get in. Congrats all even if you didn\u2019t get in there are always other opportunities out there!\n\nedit: 30 more people online so I guess this is all Dartmouth bound applicants. Get active in the comment guys and share tips everyone can learn something from one another!",

It definitely helped that my ECs are strong and I am ranked #1 in my school, but making sure essays are VERY tailored to Dartmouth and speak to how you would contribute to Dart community are the most important things you can do. There is a reason they have an entire section of their website dedicated to student blogs. They want you to engage with the community.",

Instead of the program making a difference, it is more so the fact that your peers are competitive. Almost everyone I know is going to a top 10 college and a lot of people got accepted into multiple ivy league schools. Find comfort in the fact that you are a competitive applicant for the admissions process though and lean on your peers. I'm so glad I had a community like Dartmouth Bound. They encouraged me to apply to my dream school(yale) early. Also for anecdotal evidence, I got into Harvard, Yale, and Princeton but I was rejected from Dartmouth after bound.",

From this, I understood Bound as being what types of students admissions officers are looking for in general rather than who they are trying to individually admit into their college (Evidence: I got accepted into Cornell and a couple of top 20s rd, my bound peers went to t10s-20s). I also know that even a few Dartmouth Bound Leaders were admitted to Dartmouth but rejected from Bound. So if you have been admitted to Bound, huge congrats! You'll learn lots about the college process!! But if you were rejected, no worries, that won't diminish your chances when you apply for the college :) Best of luck! :D",

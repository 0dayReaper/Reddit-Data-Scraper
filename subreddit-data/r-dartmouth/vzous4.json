            "comment": "it can be pretty challenging considering the 10 week constraint (makes it like a crash course tbh). If you have 0 experience, I would definitely consider going through w3school\u2019s python module as a primer. cs 1 at dartmouth for new programmers is one of those classes where if you don\u2019t understand a concept it can snowball into a lot of missed sleep later on down the term \ud83d\udc80 \n\nedit: you can definitely make an A if you have no experience, but you NEED to put in the effort (talking at least 1 hr-90 min each day practicing) i went from no CS experience AT ALL  to getting an A in that class and graduating with an MDS and QSS degree; definitely was a lot of work though especially since i wasn\u2019t exactly intuitive with programming (don\u2019t be surprised if some people are complete naturals at it lol), but then again so are all harder intro level courses like this",

The TA\u2019s help a lot, and Vasanta is the best Prof. on this campus. Sure, you will have to study and work on labs a good amount, but I think you\u2019re being overdramatic. An A is more than possible.",

    "postText": "Hi all! Last year I made a post where I asked you to share your insights in my undergraduate thesis survey about inclusion, representation, of racial minorities and low-income students in the elite universities (Ivy League + NYU) and I wanted to tell you thank you so much for your generosity from all Dartmouth students who took the time to do it. I even remember one of you commented they were interested to see the results when it was done and I have good news: I got honors and that allowed to published it in my uni platform of researches! :) So you can just dm if you are curious about the study.\n\nAgain thank you, couldn't be more proud and happy for being able to graduate with such an important work, and a big part was thanks to all the students who were willing to participate. If you ever need the help of a spanish-speaker journalist, you know I'm here! :) hope you have an amazing end of the year &lt;3",

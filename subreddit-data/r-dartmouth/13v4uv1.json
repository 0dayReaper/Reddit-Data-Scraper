I think the Coop has online ordering but no delivery.  \n\nShaw\u2019s in West Leb (along with Walmart, etc) will be the closest major chains.  Not walkable",

It\u2019s about a 5 mile drive from Hanover or you can take Advanced Transit public transportation. \n\nThere used to be a mini convenience store on Food Court (Topside) where you could use your dining plan dollars but not sure if that\u2019s still there.",

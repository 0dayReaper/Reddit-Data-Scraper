    "postText": "Hey, \u201827 here! I was trying to do some digging on the freshmen dorm sitch, especially in regards to gender-inclusive housing, but the Dartmouth website is really vague. I was wondering if there were any trans or nonbinary folk on here that had any experience with this? I\u2019m attending an admitted students day later this month, so I\u2019m sure I can get some questions answered there, but I\u2019d really like to hear someone\u2019s first-hand experience. Thanks in advance!",

The restroom situation may differ a bit between the newer and older buildings though, so that may be an area you want to focus on sussing out. Once you get to sophomore year, there are also gender-inclusive houses/societies like Tabard, Alpha Theta, Phi Tau, Amarna, and Panarchy",

The LLCs at McLaughlin etc have single restrooms and shower rooms. If you're concerned and want some privacy, I would put this on your housing doc and try to aim to live in an LLC. I think there is additional forms/maybe a short essay.",

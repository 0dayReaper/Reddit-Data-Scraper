    "postText": "Hey Dartmouth community. Dartmouth is my dreamschool and I am an international applicant. As a person who didn't have english as a language of instruction for two years I had to provide english proficiency exam score. So I got my IELTS Academic results and it is an overall score of 8(reading and listening 8.5 speaking 7.5 and writing 7). Dartmouth says that the most competitive students score above 7 and on various websites the requirement is written a 7. So my question: is the seven in writing gonna be a problem?\nI am an international applicant for undergraduate admissions.",

Even if it were low, it wouldn't make that much of a difference, but you're in the clear. IT IS JUST A WAY TO CHECK IF YOU'D BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN ENGLISH AND NOTHING MORE. WAIT FOR THE RESULT GODDAMN.",

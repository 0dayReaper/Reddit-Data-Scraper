Knowing some of the '24s and '23s, I can say with great confidence that the school is a place where you will be intellectually challenged and socially loved. So, full send!",

She got a lot of amazing opportunities. While I don't want to reveal too much personal info, she got an internship with a near $100K salary at a very reputable company.\n\nPersonally, I don't think monetary or any tangible reward for that matter represents success. My point is more that UMich is a great university that offers a great culture and great opportunities to its students. If you go there, you're going to love it. She's happier than I've ever seen her before, and she's thriving.\n\nI'm truly sorry about Dartmouth. It's a fantastic college and one that I myself hope to attend some day.\n\nAs someone who has yet to experience the stresses of Ivy day, take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt: I know that you're intelligent and that you've worked hard throughout high school. Take those lessons and carry them into the next amazing chapter of your life.\n\nKeep your chin up. You've got an amazing yet daunting path ahead of you, so take the plunge and don't look back! Good luck and do something awesome &lt;3",

If Dartmouth is a strong choice for you, you should reach out to the financial aid office and let them know of an aid package you received at a peer school, they will try to match the offer. I got an extra 10k per year this way.",

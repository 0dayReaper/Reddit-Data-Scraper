In many of my Chem classes there was homework assigned each class and it was never graded, it was there as a tool for you to confirm you were learning things.",

Maybe that\u2019s just a quarter system thing, but I had to plan out my major years in advance because some classes that were integral to my major were only offered every two or even four years. This isn\u2019t as much of an issue for more common majors (CS, engineering, and econ come to mind), but even as a biology major planning was important for me.",

I would think that, with Dartmouth\u2019s small class sizes, there would be an emphasis on discussion-based learning (like the Harkness table model if you\u2019ve ever heard of it).",

I\u2019m not going to lie to you and say that you\u2019re not going to find racism here, because you will, but not more than I found in high school or anywhere else if that makes sense. In fact, I\u2019d consider my experience at Dartmouth fantastic in comparison to my high school experience. People are a lot more mindful and accepting. I am not sure what you heard, but rest assured that the other Ivy leagues are probably worse lol",

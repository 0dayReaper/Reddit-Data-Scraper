We've created this thread for you to meet each other, ask questions to the rest of the community, and to celebrate!\n\nFor those looking before decisions have been released, please do not speculate or post about things like documents changing in your dashboard. Nobody benefits from this guesswork, and your real decision will come soon enough!",

Sophomore and Junior year GPAs were *rough.* I finally learned how to take care of myself senior year and got back on track. Final GPA was a 3.7, and I graduated cum laude. \n\nDon't sweat the small stuff, and focus on taking care of yourself. Dartmouth is hard, and law schools know that Dartmouth is hard. Pleeennnttttyyyyy of Dartmouth students get into law school with or without a 4.0 GPA. \n\nGood luck, and try and focus on being a person instead of a number!",

A 3.9 is also not a cakewalk by any means and takes a lot of work, but you have more leeway to not be perfect. But I'd recommend not coming in with a GPA in mind because chances are, you'll end up disappointed.",

Only a handful a students achieve it every year out of a class of 1000+ students. \n\nMe and a couple of my other friends from Dartmouth are currently all at t-14 law schools, and doing just fine, even without 4.0 GPAs. Keep in mind that even with the top schools having 75th percentile GPAs at 3.9+, it means the vast majority of them didn't have 4.0s.\n\nSure, it's always better to have a better grade than not, but remember to take care of yourself and not let the idea of 4.0 completely ruin your physical and mental health.",

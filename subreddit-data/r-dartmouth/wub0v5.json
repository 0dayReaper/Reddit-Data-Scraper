    "postText": "I realize this may be a bit of a dumb question, I don't doubt the work load is rigorous, I love my job and am currently on a 1.5 year long military leave of absence from it. That being said, I am interested in pursuing Dartmouth MBA. Busy times of year for me are spring and fall and I travel for work, but I don't see any signs of alternative MBA options (online/semester by semester). Just didn't know if anyone had a somewhat similar experience. Thanks.",

Learning is great, but you can honestly learn on your own by reading and watching YouTube. The connections you make will happen outside of the classroom, so if you\u2019re working a job somewhere, you\u2019re missing out on that",

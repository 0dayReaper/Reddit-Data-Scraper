They somehow are cheaper than the original, i think because they\u2019re not ad much of a fashion statement. They look exactly as the original tan ones just with a thicker sole bc it was originally made for construction workers. I got them for &lt;$200 last year  from a specialty shoe store but you might be able to find them online. Personally i recommend timbs but not the normal ones in terms of waterproofing and snow etc",

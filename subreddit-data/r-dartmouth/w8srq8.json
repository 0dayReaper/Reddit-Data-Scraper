I was wondering if anyone could provide any information about what the room/dorm is like. Approximately how big are the rooms? Does French have and larger common areas outside of the dorm rooms? What is the laundry situation like? Is there an elevator (haha i hope i don\u2019t have to walk up too many stairs)\n\n\nAny information or tips would be amazing!! Thanks so much!!",

    "postText": "Am I the only one who thinks Dartmouth's coronavirus response was absolutely horrific? \n\nTimeline:\n\n- Announces that students have 4 days to leave dorms, and will not be able to stay \n- The day after students have to vacate (and tuition is due), announces that students will not be returning\n- Prohibits students, even those still in Hanover, from retrieving their belongings for any reason\n- Has yet to refund anyone for spring term, and provided zero assistance for students with nowhere to go or money to get there\n\nThe fact that they announced that students wouldn't be returning the literal day after evicting everyone makes it incredibly clear that the decision was ready, and they just didn't want students to panic (or to not pay spring tuition). \n\nSitting here as a '20, I'll have to cross the country and return to Hanover after June to retrieve my belongings: which I could've taken with me and simply moved on had Dartmouth announced their decision when they made it. \n\nUnlike almost all of its peer institutions, including Yale and Harvard specifically), Dartmouth has failed to keep dorms open for students who rely on them for housing, and has opted instead to throw hundreds of poor students onto couches, shelters, and the streets with 4 days notice. Their reasoning? To \"fight the spread of coronavirus\": by sending students traveling around the globe after an outbreak instead of isolating on campus. Dartmouth screwed over its students because it wanted to dodge culpability, and its response literally worsened the crisis. \n\nAbsolutely horrible crisis response by Dartmouth on all levels. Good thing they raised so much with the Call to Lead, as it is hard for me to imagine someone from the current classes choosing to donate to Dartmouth after their disastrous mishandling.",

            "comment": "R y'all serious? This is SO MUCH MISINFORMATION. I suggest you read the emails that have all of this information instead of blowing it off as \"useless.\"\n\n1. They announced that students had to leave by Monday on the previous Wednesday. That was WAY more time than other colleges gave them.\n2. Given how fast the situation changed within that same week before leaving, could you blame them for delaying given the fact that Dartmouth sustains the entire local economy of Hanover? Unlike other schools, Dartmouth had other factors to consider because us shutting down had more at stake than just the well-being of students.\n3. Are you saying that telling people to leave and come back wouldn't potentially bring the virus to campus/increase its spread/unnecessarily burden a rural community with an older population that relies on ONE hospital to sustain basically all of northern new england? Get over yourself. \n4. I've been refunded in full for housing and meals, including student fees. They said they'd get it done by March 25 if you read the student assembly FAQ (which they did), and added on student fee refunds today. This is just straight up wrong. \n\nAlso, as for the dorm situation, their response wasn't perfect, but not in the ways you expected. They approved all international students to stay on campus EXCEPT those who were already US citizens by MISTAKE. According to OPAL/the FYSEP coordinator, this was unintentional because it was done automatically. \n\nAdditionally, they made channels of communication open through the dean of the college email account, offered additional support through several offices, and have communicated daily with new information and updates. \n\nThey couldn't cancel spring break and isolate everyone on campus because PEOPLE ALREADY STARTED LEAVING. Most people I knew didn't have finals that thursday/friday. I was literally on a bus when Harvard canceled that Tuesday morning, and a ton of others were already off campus by then. No one expected Harvard to cancel, and I don't think any of the peers intended to either until that happened. This sent the higher education world into a meltdown, and Dartmouth had to worry not just about a student body but a local economy too. \n\nThe schools you mentioned (Harvard, Yale, Pton &amp; more) also sent off their students really abruptly without telling htem how they could find housing/accommodations and told them not to come back while they were in the middle of their spring breaks. Most of these schools actually fucked over international and low-income students by providing no information (Harvard, particularly, announced they were cancelling and didn't tell low-income/international students what to do), some even denied international NON-US-CITIZEN students (cough: princeton) from staying, and all just totally screwed people over. \n\nI don't defend Dartmouth in a lot of things. This is something I will say they did better than most. The only university that I think addressed this better was Cornell; they did everything we had to ask Dartmouth for, but way earlier.\n\nRead your emails next time. They updated people daily, were communicative, and answered questions as soon as those answers were available.",

I don't blame them for shutting down: I blame them for strategically releasing this information the day after forcing students to evict and having tuition due.\n\n3. Absolutely, students shouldn't come back to Hanover. But disallowing those students who were _still in Hanover_ from getting their belongings is awful.\n\n4. I'm glad to hear that you personally received what they said they would provide! Regardless, that isn't the case for all students (including myself), and expecting students to be able to relocate (and pay first months' rent + deposit) and then giving them money a week later is weak, and it's not like the school doesn't have the funds available.\n\n5. Declining to offer housing for their low-income students is a failing, period. Even if they were willing to house international students, the fact is that they said that they would only house students in \"exceptional\" cases -- and otherwise _being homeless_ was apparently not considered an exceptional case. Not sure how them admittedly _mistakenly_ allowing students to stay changes anything...\n\nI'm also not sure where you got the idea that I called the emails \"useless\"  or weren't reading them: I was paying very close attention to them, and I read every last one, as my having food and shelter depended on it. I'm glad that their handling of it worked for you, and I appreciate the administration being transparent; but that's about the only thing to their credit in this whole fiasco.",

I'm not an international student. I wouldn't even be truly homeless if they told me to leave. I did have to talk to them though after receiving an initial email saying I had to leave, but that took like 10% effort on my part and I got no pushback from them.",

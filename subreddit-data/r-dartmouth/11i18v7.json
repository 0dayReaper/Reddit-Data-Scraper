    "postText": "Hello everyone! I got into Dartmouth recently for a PhD program and wanted to ask about finding housing around the area. I am mostly looking at 1 bedroom apartments but am open for 2 bedroom 2 bathroom ones too. I was wondering how is actually living at Summit on Jupiter buildings? Also hit me up if you potentially want to be roommates!",

            "comment": "I live at summit. Honestly housing at Dartmouth is a nightmare! There\u2019s a real cost problem, and student stipend is only about 2700 a month after taxes. Summit costs 1300 pp a month for a two bedroom, but that does include all furniture, utilities, internet and parking. I couldn\u2019t find anything on campus in Hanover under 1300, but maybe you will have better luck than me. Lebanon and even Vermont have some cheap housing options, I found 1k rent on a one bed for example, but you would absolutely need a car whereas at summit you can take a shuttle to campus. Also that 1k doesn\u2019t include furniture or utilities. \n\nI found summit to be the best option financially and pragmatically for me, but it\u2019s still a huge portion of my paycheck and is barely affordable. The apartments are much much nicer than you would expect from a college dorm, and they have luxury amenities like washer and dryer in unit. Living here is actually really great on the day to day, even with a roommate I have a lot of my own space and my own bathroom. Before I came to Dartmouth I lived in a 4 bed apartment in Boston with 6 roommates for 800 a month, and this is way better standard of living wise.\n\nBesides the steep price, summit has had a lot of serious issues this year with heat failing for weeks while temperatures are in the negatives. I\u2019ve also heard of noise complaints due to partying. My building, building 4, seems to be majority PhD students who tend to be quieter, and also has managed to avoid the heating issues so if you can get an apartment in this building I recommend it. Another terrible thing about summit is that their lease is predatory. I\u2019ve never rented an apartment before that doesn\u2019t let you break the lease. Usually there is one month rent fee or something to leave, but at summit you\u2019re on the hook for the full year price. It\u2019s really messed up and exploitative to students who have no other housing options.\n\nFor me it was the best option and I don\u2019t regret it, but I might have if I was one of the people whose heating failed for three weeks in the middle of winter and management did nothing to help. If you have a car I think the best thing to do is look around and see if you can find anything in town. You might get lucky, especially if you\u2019re looking with a roommate. If you don\u2019t have and can\u2019t get a car I don\u2019t know what other option you have besides summit or paying a huge premium to live on campus.",

You have to fill out a quick form about yourself and your preferences. For example, I said wanted someone clean and quiet who doesn\u2019t have a pet and my roommate checked all those boxes, and we ended up being super compatible!",

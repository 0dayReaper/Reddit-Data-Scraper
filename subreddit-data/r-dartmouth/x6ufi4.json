            "comment": "As a Bostonian who then went to Dartmouth, I'd say that for some, Dartmouth can feel too isolated. Almost everyone I went to Dartmouth loved it, but not everyone--and of those who didn't, the difficulty of getting away from Dartmouth on a regular basis, outside of taking a bus to Boston, Montreal, or whatnot on the weekend, was a factor; as was seeing the same people day in and day out. Sure, with 4000 undergrads, you'll still meet new people each term (you won't know *everyone*), but it's not like Boston where you can go to a bar and run into students from other institutions. And there's no real anonymity the way you might have with hanging out from students from other places.\n\nOn the other hand, outside of new fellow college student-aged faces, Dartmouth does a good job of bringing the things you might be interested in in a city to Hanover. World class entertainers come to the Hop, through the Programming Board, etc., in a way that gets a hell of a lot more expensive for tickets in the real world once you graduate! World leaders come to speak at the College; most people running for President make an appearance in the Hanover area; important intellectual voices come to Dartmouth, etc. And if there's something you want that Dartmouth doesn't have, it's pretty easy to start a club and get funding from the Council on Student Organizations (COSO) to make things happen.",

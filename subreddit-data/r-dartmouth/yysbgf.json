Besides grades and letters of recs, I had a killer internship summer before senior year. I was also from Maine, which has a relatively lower representation and weaker applicant pool, so I stood out amongst those jabronis. \n\nFor the record, I didn\u2019t get accepted to Williams or Colgate, and was waitlisted at bowdoin, so I really have no idea how I got in",

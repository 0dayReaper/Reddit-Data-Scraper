Sadly I still need the high school official in order to submit the application. I have to people I excluded from consideration but it was only because I put their info in incorrectly (I know, should have been smarter)\n\nBasically, is there any way to get more invites when the application no longer has a \u201cinvite\u201d button?\n\nEmail is out to admissions but since it\u2019s so close to the deadline I might not get a reply which is why I want to ask here. \n\nThank you all in advance",

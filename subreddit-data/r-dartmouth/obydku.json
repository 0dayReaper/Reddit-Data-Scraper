    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nI'm a medical student from Ohio coming to rotate at DHMC for a month (8/23 - 9/17). I've looked just about everywhere from Dartlist to AirBnB and Upper Valley Rentals but can't seem to find any living space that doesn't require minimum 6 month lease. Would anyone have any additional advice/info on trying to find a rental or sublease? Thanks!",

Geisel students start away rotations almost right away. \nDo you know any physicians/people in the area who may be willing to put you up for a month?\nYou might also have luck with this website: https://rotatingroom.com/ -- it's for med students on away rotations/interviews.",

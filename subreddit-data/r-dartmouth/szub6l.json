Here is an open dataset of the student subreddits of the top 10 US colleges, according to [Forbes' 2019 ranking](https://www.forbes.com/pictures/5d4c7425cb4912000998d85c/top-25-colleges-of-2019). You are featured in there, too - congratulations on making it in!\n\nThis is a big CSV file full of Reddit posts and comments. Could be fun to browse through - or, if you're into Machine Learning/AI, even get some insights on your alma mater.\n\n_(P.S.: We're still developing the site. If you're interested in checking out other features of our platform, throw us a DM and I'll try get you some free credits to mess with.)_",

Digging up obscure half-remembered posts, verifying screenshots of comments (off the top of my head) could be pretty hard before. Hopefully our project can make it easier to do. I use it to monitor news on a hobby of mine - it gives some pretty good results on the goings-on if you get the search query right.\n\nOther features are more like power tools - those are geared to professional researchers. We have functionality for making themed large-scale datasets like this one. Hopefully, it can save scientists and social media analysts some time by giving them good text data.",

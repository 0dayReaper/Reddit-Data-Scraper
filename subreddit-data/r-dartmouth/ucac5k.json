    "postText": "McLaughlin seems very nice and I might apply to a few LLCs to get a room there. I was wondering what the different LLCs are like e.g. how were your experiences there, what type of activities they do, what type of ppl do they usually attract, pros and cons and over all vibe. \nI feel like I'm gonna apply to Thriving Through Transitions and the Great Issues Scholars. I feel like I'm the type of person they want at GIS and would be a good fit there but I also like the mission of T3 and it might be helpful on adjusting to a new environment, especially as an international. Might try the Humanities LLC too.\nAlso, is the niceness of McLaughlin worth being on the edge of campus?",

            "comment": "I've lived in Mclaughlin for two years, feel free to dm me with any questions since that's a pretty wide range you want to cover.\n\nYou'll be close to the LSC, Steele, Sudikoff, and the library so if you're interested in life sciences, physical sciences, or cs then it won't be that far off. It'll be like a 5-6 minute trek to dining halls but it really wasn't that bad.\n\nFacilities were great and even if you get assigned a double, the rooms are spacious enough and separated by a door that it's pretty much a single. \n\nIn terms of type of people and vibe, it honestly depends on who you are grouped with. Some of the clusters like humanities were very tight knit and did alot of events but I heard that others were very hands off and struggled to even retain interest (those have since not been renewed bc of covid it looks like). \n\nThere's alot activity wise like apple picking, 6 flags, nyc/boston trips but again that depends on if you enjoy interfacing with your cluster and if that cluster is involved at all. \n\nI have alot more I can say about this so just feel free to DM any McLaughlin/LLC questions.",

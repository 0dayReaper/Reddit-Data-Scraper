    "postText": "Hello Everybody,\n\nMy sister has been touring colleges and visited Dartmouth this morning. Unfortunately, my 8 year old brother lost his beloved stuffed animal dog along the way.\n\nI know this is a long shot since I assume most people aren't back on campus but we will put forward a $150 reward if anyone finds it. It is a brown dog about the size of a football. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

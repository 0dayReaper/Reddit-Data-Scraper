    "postText": "If you took the class, did you find it worth it as opposed to the normal freshman writing + seminar that most do? I gather that it is a harder set of classes, but was it still manageable and is it rewarding enough to offset the greater commitment? I\u2019m interested in classics and the humanities but I am unsure about my preparedness for the course. Thank you.",

My boyfriend and several of my good friends did.\n\nMy bf hated it and ended up switching out to take a First Year Seminar instead of Hum 2. I think it was especially the other students he disliked.\n\nI do also know a girl who quite liked it. But I know overall in my year (23) it was a contentious sequence.\n\nFor me, Writing 5 was super easy, but I already came to Dartmouth with a very good set of skills. If they let you into Hum, then you are prepared to take it, I promise! But there's also no shame in taking Writing 5, that's what almost everyone does. First year seminars vary depending on profs\u2014I hated mine but that's a long story and it wasn't really hard.",

Challenging but very manageable. And you become very close to others in the cohort. Some are still my friends now six years later.",

It\u2019s honestly a crapshoot and your experience will be heavily determined by your section. 19F I had an incredible section prof and great peers in the sections, it really whipped my writing into shape and was a fantastic class. 20W it sucked, my prof was boring and I learned next to nothing. The big lectures are usually no good, just because half the time is spent by other freshmen trying to show off.\n\nI say take the first section and see how you like it.",

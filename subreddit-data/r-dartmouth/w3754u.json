    "postText": "I'm asking these general questions for all the colleges I am applying to soon, but Dartmouth is in a slightly diff position as it is my ED, I. \n\nWould anyone at Dartmouth studying chemistry speak to the nature of the program and any specific qualities you may find within it? \n\nAlso, what is life at Dartmouth like? I've been doing research (as is necessary) but it would also help to hear some personal insights from students there. I've never lived in the northern United States (TX) and have always wondered what things are like up there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks, all",

From what I\u2019ve heard, gen chem (5 and 6) and organic (51 and 52) are the worst courses by far bc they\u2019re pre-med weed out classes. The quality of those 4 classes also varies wildly depending on which prof is teaching. Aside from those classes, the rest of the chem profs seem to enjoy teaching and want students to do well and enjoy the subjects. \n\nBecause of the lab components of courses the chem dept is also a great place to work on campus as an undergrad TA. Pay isn\u2019t stellar, but you aren\u2019t expected to do as much work as the graduate TAs anyway.\n\n\u201cLife at Dartmouth\u201d is kind of a broad question. The climate and cultural quirks of New England take a little getting used to if you aren\u2019t from there. Campus is somewhat insular from the surrounding the area (a lot of students don\u2019t go into town at all unless they are going out to eat). For social life, the majority of upperclassmen are affiliated (in Greek life) but everyone will tell you your level of involvement is entirely up to you. There\u2019s little pressure to rush, and lots of people stay unaffiliated but are welcome to hang out in Greek spaces if invited by their affiliated friends. Long story short life @ dart is really what you make of it.",

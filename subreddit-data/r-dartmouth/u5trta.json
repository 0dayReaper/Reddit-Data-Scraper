            "comment": "talk to the financial aid office. schedule a meeting with them, explain your situation (especially the part about tuition being more than post-tax income and your EFC). that is your best bet. i've known plenty of people who successfully petitioned their tuition down by talking to the financial aid office, both at dartmouth and at other similar schools.\n\nit is not an easy process by any stretch of the imagination. i've heard it's quite stressful. but take a deep breath and get in contact with them. that is your best bet.\n\ni don't think it's a faux pas to mention other schools, especially if they gave you more financial aid than dartmouth (emphasis on FINANCIAL aid, because dartmouth will not care about merit offers since they don't give them). tell the office about those offers in a respectful way, and explain that dartmouth is your dream school but that money is a big consideration for you.\n\ngood luck! i'll keep you in my thoughts &lt;3",

I've scheduled a zoom call with the office later this week, and will be talking to them about aid.\n\nUnfortunately, schools have given me very little aid, with the highest package still making it impossible to attend. Regarding merit offers, are you referring to merit scholarships?\n\nDartmouth is my dream school; I'll be turning down a few great schools (cambridge, chicago, CMU, berkeley) to attend - will the quality of those schools impact the aid offer in any significant way?",

                            "comment": "Yes, I am referring to merit scholarships.\n\nI have not gone through the aid process myself, but again if you can respectfully find a way to insert the other colleges into the conversation to demonstrate your desire to go to Dartmouth, I think it's worth a shot. I would still mention the highest aid package you got, especially if Dartmouth gave you nothing.\n\nAnother thing to be aware of is ways your FAFSA may not have accurately represented the \"usual\" income of your family. When I applied to Dartmouth, my FAFSA was messed up because the company my father works for had just been sold, and he had \"assets\" that weren't actually his, which Dartmouth counted as money in our pocket. Likewise, I had a friend whose father sold his business when she applied to college. He was in the process of buying a new business with that money (and these were small businesses, think local car dealerships) but her college again considered that money to be stuff they could just spend on college. When she spoke to the college she wanted to go to, I know she told them about the sale and about how all that money was going to be re-invested. I also believe she might have given them older tax returns to demonstrate how much her parents make *on average*. I think that may be helpful. My friend did end up getting a much more advantageous aid package.\n\nGather every tax return your parents or guardians still have on file, as well as all of your past tax returns. Also, think about if your financial situation really reflects how much money your family has. Write down things that have cost your family a lot of money, like medical bills or another child about to go to college. At the end of the day, respect and earnestness will take you a long way. Be upfront with the office. I really hope it works out for you!",

It doesn't explain typical assets, which I assume means a house and retirement funds.\n\nAnd yeah, you can mention that you got financial aid from other schools. I did this over ten years ago, so things probably have changed. I showed them the school that had the lowest family contribution. And when I showed what Northwestern offered, they couldn't match it because NU was offering loans, and that's why they couldn't drop the cost of my parent's annual contribution. Express that Dartmouth is your first choice and you want to go there, but it's too expensive for your family! \n\nIf you have been in contact with admissions, you should message them and see if they can give you advice. They know you and picked you; they are interested in making it work! \n\nIf you have any siblings in college, bring that up! They're supposed to try and split the family contribution if the schools cost about the same. That helped me out since my brother was at an equally expensive private uni. \n\nCongratulations on getting admitted to so many great schools.",

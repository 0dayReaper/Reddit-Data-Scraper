I have a difficult decision to make however because I also got accepted to Brown.\n\nAny advice over which one to choose would be greatly appreciated. It can be anything from pros/cons to academics to social life to dorms etc etc :)\n\nI want to concentrate in Political Science / International Relations, and also specialise in languages.\n\nThank you!!",

            "comment": "Two very different but excellent programs. You'll be well set up to study languages and government/IR at either  institution. Brown has an open curriculum whereas Dartmouth has a core and prescribed majors. Dartmouth instructs languages using the Rassias method which I think is a major pro. I think the cultures at the two schools are also very different. Think about what you want as your undergraduate training. Dartmouth IR is incredibly strong, and the focus on undergrads is unparalleled. At other places you may be competing with graduate students for attention. Obviously I'm biased as a Dartmouth grad, but I had a wonderful time there studying IR, Arabic, and French.",

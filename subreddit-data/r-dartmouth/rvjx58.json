My mother once worked with an MS-PhD-MD chemical engineer-turned-orthopedic surgeon at Stanford Med with a single undergraduate degree in Francophone Studies completed in two years. The most that extra 73848 hrs of studying and $80,000 extra year\u2019s tuition for a dual degree will get you is a cute quip on a museum date or a conversation starter at a neighborhood cookout that quickly devolves into mindless sports banter.\n\nONE degree will empower you to study whatever else you like on your own. Like, my dad spent a year getting an online MA in philosophy after finishing a BS in biophysics a year and a half early WHILE working full-time and taking care of baby me.\n\nTLDR: Undergrad doesn\u2018t matter one TWIT. Postgraduate qualifications help you become a seasoned scholar. Graduate early and hone your craft.",

            "comment": "This is pretty hard. Basically, you have to make sure the two majors and the minor also fulfill your distribution requirements because 2 majors and a minor is probably around 28ish classes, and you only get 36. It takes a lot of planning, and knowing early what you want to do. It doesn\u2019t sound fun to me, but it\u2019s certainly possible, especially if you do a couple 4 class terms",

And then took planning and petitioning a department to get a class cross-listed as something else so I could finish it all. \n\nAgree with others that it\u2019s not worth bending over backwards to do.",

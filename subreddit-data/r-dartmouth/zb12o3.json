The second is probably the homecoming football game. Outside of those two games, attendance is going to be pretty sparse. \n\nDartmouth certainly doesn\u2019t lack in school spirit - I\u2019d argue that you\u2019ll find a greater % of students and alumni \u201cbleed green\u201d than your traditional Big 10, PAC 12, etc. type schools. It just doesn\u2019t originate or center around our sports teams.",

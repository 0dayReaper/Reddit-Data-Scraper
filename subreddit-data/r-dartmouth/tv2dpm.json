    "postText": " What should i do in my 4 years of college to ensure that i get into a great college like Dartmouth for my masters (Focused in engineering) or to just rephrase it, what worked out for you and how did you get the most out of your undergrad experience?\n\nApart from acads of course i wanted to know what do i have to do in order to build a great profile (have asked a few people and got too many surface level answers) wanted a detailed guideline as to what worked out for y'all and what mistakes did y'all make?\n\n* What does the college usually look for?\n* More internships in a specific area of work or research internships under different professors?\n* I'm currently just entering college, did a bunch of internships for content writing etc and have a blog site+ i'm active on linkedin as well so i have an idea as to how things work but i just want to make the best out of these 4 years\n\nAlot of people talk about networking, how exactly can you network? I heard there are these student programs for undergrad etc which are fully funded by the college but i'm not aware if they're there at Dartmouth\n\nAlso i'm an international student so i just wanted to make a proper plan and make the best out of my undergrad journey!\n\nAll your inputs will be appreciated! Thanks alot!",

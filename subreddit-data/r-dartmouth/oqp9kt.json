I was once like you, and the best advice I can offer you is that you\u2019re going to look back 2 years from now at wherever you end up (someplace wonderful judging by what you posted), and laugh. Deep breathe! I\u2019m no admissions officer but based on my experience, there\u2019s no algorithm for the perfect permutation for an admitted student. They\u2019re just looking for a diverse variety of unique high achieving students. Whether you fit that bill, is up to yourself and ultimately up to them on that particular year. Focus on doing the things you love, try new things, and work hard. I would submit your SAT score though lol.",

Next you need to figure out 'why Dartmouth?' or really \\`why XYZ University?\\`. What are you trying to get out of college? What sort of experience do you want? Are you a good fit for that school? Dartmouth is a smaller university with a more liberal arts college feel. Is that what you want? Dartmouth is known for really tight-knit communities---college in the wilderness sort of thing. Is that what you want? No one can answer those questions for you. It's a matter of you figuring out what you want out of college. Then find a variety of schools that will give you that--make sure some are safeties.",

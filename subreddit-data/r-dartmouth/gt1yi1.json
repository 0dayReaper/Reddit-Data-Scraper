We hold a bunch of different kinds of events like: Weekly Friday (Jummah) prayers, monthly community potlucks, Gile foliage hikes, Gelato/boba socials, Quran circles, Iftars/Eid prayers during Ramadan, and frisbee on the Green! And all of these events are open to anybody! The community is super welcoming; I\u2019ve had a bunch of my non-Muslim friends attend these events and they\u2019ve really enjoyed the experience.",

Then deduct it by 60% for taxes, housing, groceries, utilities, phone bills, etc. The remaining amount of money is what you have left for entertainment, shopping, travel, any emergencies, and paying off that debt. \n\nIf you look at that and calculate how long it'd take you to payback your debt, and conclude that you'd be happy with that, then it's your own decision. At least it's backed by some research.\n\nAlso remember that's assuming you find a job immediately upon graduation in those fields and locations.",

            "comment": "This was my situation when I was starting undergrad (at Georgetown). My parents made too much money to qualify for aid but weren't willing to pay (this was just before the last recession so college was a little bit cheaper but I was still staring down $50k/year). I was going to study math/cs so I knew worst case I could go sell my soul in banking for a few years and knock off my debt. I did a lot of introspection about what was important to me in life. I decided that a solid education was very important to me, I felt that Georgetown could do it best, and I decided that part of my education was going to involve financing my education. I worked nearly full time while double majoring and having a great social life. I took jobs that didn't pay as well but let me do homework on the job or go to events that I would have had to pay to go to otherwise. I worked multiple jobs in the summer and took jobs that included housing to eliminate that expense. I still graduated $80k in debt. I kept up that lifestyle for 2 more years and paid it all off. It's a gamble and it's not the right decision for most people. I considered transferring after my freshman year so I wouldn't have to work as much. However, I would do it all again knowing everything that I do now. If you have a very strong reason to go to Dartmouth instead of someplace different, if you are comfortable living on very little money, and if you are willing to work your ass off even when your friends aren't, you can do it.\n\nI graduated into a recession and all of my Georgetown friends had jobs within a few months of graduation. Most of my friends who went to state school did not. I don't know what the Dartmouth alumni network is like (I just saw this post and it reminded me so much of myself at that age I had to respond). Big name schools do carry weight on your resume. When I was in high school everyone told me it didn't matter. I've done hiring for several big tech companies and I've seen great resumes passed over in favor of those who went to a brand name school. In a recession, the big name school will get you an interview over a better qualified candidate (at least in Silicon Valley).",

But I got into a few state schools and I even got full tuition and a stipend from the school I ultimately chose and I don\u2019t regret it one bit. My state school taught me sooo much and it is because I was able to save that money that now I\u2019m able to go to Dartmouth for grad school this fall. I\u2019ll have to take out a little bit of loans, but the fact that I didn\u2019t have to take out any for undergrad was so nice. And not having that burden of loans and getting to just enjoy school and put my free time towards Greek life, student involvement stuff made my undergraduate experience sooo much better. That 180k is certainly your choice to make and, for some, it is worth it, but don\u2019t discount those state schools either because you could start with a \u201cwhat if\u201d attitude, but end with an experience that has you thinking you couldn\u2019t see yourself anywhere else for those 4 years.

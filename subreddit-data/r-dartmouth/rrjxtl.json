I have applied to Dartmouth\u2019s Class of 2026, and it is one of my top choices.\n\nI am interested in shopping for laptops, and I am curious about which laptops are the best or most commonly used by computer science students.\n\nIf possible, I\u2019d like to know which technical specifications are ideal as well.\n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "TL;DR: Macs are fine. The M1 chips are incredibly powerful and efficient.\n\nMost people will encourage Windows over Mac for tech-related work. However, Mac is seeing increased acceptance in software engineering/development. And honestly, the shortcomings of Macs are less noticeable for college coursework in engineering/CS. I\u2019m one vote for Mac.\n\nAs for which one, it largely depends on your budget. If you\u2019re going for as cheap as possible, you\u2019ll be able to get away with a baseline M1 Air. If you can fork over a bit more, I\u2019d go for a baseline M1 MacBook Pro. And beyond that, a baseline MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip (14\u201d or 16\u201d) will be PLENTY good enough for your needs as a CS student and will probably last you well past your 4 years of college.",

However, I've found that once it's set up, I have fewer issues with updates and compatibility and weird firewall/security issues than my friends on Mac. \n\nOne of my friends runs a Linux system. Tread carefully in that territory, as most profs will assume you know how to do all the setup and be extremely comfortable with Unix command line. But it does get rid of a lot of the overhead associated with the transposition from Linux Unix to Mac Unix.",

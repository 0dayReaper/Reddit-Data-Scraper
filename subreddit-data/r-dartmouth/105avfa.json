However, I don't like to stack classes in a row and do all of them as early as possible (say, from 8:50 to 12:30 on MWF). \n\nNot only does that make the few classes in a row EXHAUSTING, but sometimes (I guess depending on your workload and how much other stuff you are involved in), the other space that's empty can become boring af. I like to do something like have a 9-10 AM and 1-2 PM on MWF, and a 10 AM-12 on TR. That way classes are spaced out (you get a breather) and there aren't quite the (same amount, at least) chunks of time where you're legitimately left with nothing to do.",

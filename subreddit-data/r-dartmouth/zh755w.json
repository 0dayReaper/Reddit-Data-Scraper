To all of you out there, I hope the same. The fact that you made the effort, have taken the time, dedicated hours and hours of study to be here in this moment\u2026you should be proud. Be proud you made it this far, proud of your hard work, and know that no matter the outcome you all have such a beautiful and bright future. Love, Reddit Mom \u2764\ufe0f",

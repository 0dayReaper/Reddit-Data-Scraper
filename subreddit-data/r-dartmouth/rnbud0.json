    "postText": "I don\u2019t really have any background or experience in Engineering so I\u2019m a bit nervous about being behind other students. I really like neuroscience/cog sci stuff, but I can\u2019t help but being drawn to biomedical engineering because I definitely enjoy building stuff/designing stuff that intertwines bio/Chem. If I don\u2019t major in biomedical engineering, I think I would consider neuroscience or cognitive science modified with computer science. But again, I\u2019m super uncertain about all of this. Anyone have any good insights/advice out there?",

My bff is all about engineering, and all we hear from MEM friends who think it\u2019s not exactly worth it. Just a bunch of extra Econ and business classes. But I never went into it so take my outsiders perspective with a grain of salt.",

            "comment": "As someone who did the MEM, it really depends on what you want to get out of it. The MEM appealed to me as I had just completed my BE and knew I didn't want to go into hardcore engineering. At the same time, I knew I wanted a job where I could apply my technical skills in a business setting. \n\nIn my opinion, I found the MEM to be somewhat valuable. It helped me learn a lot about jobs I wouldn't have previously considered. I got to meet some very smart people that are excellent connections (also some very dumb people but that's any grad program). At the same time, a lot of what I studied likely could have been learned on my own (not to say what I studied wasn't valuable). In a professional sense, it'll look good on a resume but it certainly won't be the deciding factor in you getting a job. The MEM network is alright, I personally haven't had to leverage it a ton yet but I know a number of people who got full time offers after their capstone internship. \n\nLike most degrees, it's really what you make of it. If you're somebody who has a clear idea of what they want to pursue, it might not be in your best interest to do the MEM. If you find the details around the program interesting and are still figuring out what you want to pursue, it may make sense for you to consider it",

I am a little sceptical about the ROI as most of my tuition will be through a loan. Can we connect and discuss the same?",

    "postText": "When you were in secondary school (elementary, middle, high school) did you play video games as a hobby/activity while you were studying to get into Dartmouth? If yes, how much time were you spending, how could you control the time you spend playing video games, did it have any effect on you, and would you recommend it? If no please still comment because I wish to hear as many people\u2019s opinions as possible.",

You'll have plenty of time to obsess over college admissions later in high school. These subreddits are full of angsty people obsessing over minutia, which especially applies to r/applyingtocollege. Go be a kid, have fun, make mistakes, you'll cross the college bridge when you get to it",

I can't give a ton of advice here, but what I would say is don't be afraid to go on tangents, ask questions in the middle, etc. While they do give us a bunch of sample questions to ask, I'd much rather have a natural conversation on one in-depth topic with some back and forth, etc. \n\nknow that's not super detailed but feel free to ask any more specific questions!",

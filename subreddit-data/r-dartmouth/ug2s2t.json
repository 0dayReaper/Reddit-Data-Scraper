    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a 21 year old living in NH who has been playing guitar for more than 8 years at this point and am also capable of backing vocals, which I intend on doing both for this band that I am putting together. I started playing guitar being inspired by punk music, but have since expanded my taste over the years to include all kinds of rock music. I have played in bands and have experience with live shows. I go to a different school but I figured that I would reach out here figuring that there may be a lot of you from NH as well!\n\nThis will be a very intense band. I'm looking for bandmates that can make themselves available at least twice a week on weekdays. We will practice for 2 hours every practice, give or take 30 minutes depending on the speed at which we are able to accomplish our goals for that night. Every member will walk into the first practice knowing the entire repertoire I have planned by heart so that all we need to work on is developing chemistry and sense of dynamics within and between songs for that practice and all those afterwards. In terms of performing live, I seek to do this at least once a month. We will work on original material, however, I have already written the majority of the material. We will start with all covers and slowly incorporate original works as we play more live shows.\n\nHere is what I am looking for from each individual member:\n\n1. Drums - Loud, fast, and tight percussionist with a great sense of dynamics from each individual song down to even the most minute details of small fills. I am a huge stickler for drummers...as such I will be highly critical in terms of who I want to fulfill this role.\n2. Bass/Backing Vocals - Someone who knows exactly how to fill the space, and is just as tight as the drummer is what I am looking for here. Must also be able to sing some form of backing vocals, preferably harmonies.\n3. Rhythm Guitarist/Co-Lead Vocals (M or F) - You must know how to execute rhythms in a way that elevates the sense of \"bigness\" this band has as well as sing. You will not need to perform backing vocals, only taking lead vocals on certain songs that you are assigned for this set.\n4. Keys/Co-Lead Vocals (M or F) - A decent keyboard player should be able to fill the space by incorporating a large variety of sounds into the mix (piano, strings, synth, etc.) from a single instrument, and be able to switch from simply making a cover more faithful to the original to making a pretty song sound prettier. Similar to the rhythm guitarist, you will not need to perform backing vocals, only taking lead vocals on certain songs that you are assigned for this set.\n\nHere is what I am looking for from ALL members besides the previous points I mentioned earlier in the post:\n\n1. 18 to 25 years old. Will not accept outside of that range.\n2. Playing your instruments in your role of choice in this band for a MINIMUM of 4 years.\n3. Must be able to bring all of their own gear. Drummers are a special case and will be figured out at some point in the future. Rhythm guitarists must possess both an electric and acoustic guitar. Singers must own at least a microphone, it is completely understandable if you don't own some sort of sound system for it (let alone want to attempt to bring it to every practice), so we will figure this out sometime later on as well.\n4. Vehemence for the genre of rock and a desire to ultimately form a bond with your bandmates that will hopefully carry on even after the band dissipates.\n5. Knowledge of showmanship and how to get the crowd nodding their heads to the rhythm, even if it's less than 50 people. It ain't just about bringing the noise, people say they're going to SEE a band play live, not listen to them.\n6. The desire to be great, and learning what you can in order to get there.\n\nSpeaking of being a great musician, there's one more note that I want to make clear. When we practice for the first time, I want to be the worst player in the room, but I'm going to try my absolute hardest to be best. Get it? Good.\n\nNow onto audition materials. There are five songs for this audition. They are as follows:\n\n1. How Far We've Come - Matchbox Twenty\n2. Welcome to the Jungle - Guns N' Roses\n3. Dreams - Fleetwood Mac\n4. Sugar, We're Goin' Down - Fall Out Boy\n5. Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting) - Elton John\n\nThis is not the full set, and at this time I am unsure if all of these songs will make the final cut for the first full repertoire, however, I am sure that 3 or 4 of them will. If there are any changes, I will let you know later via DM (I will explain that shortly). All musicians must audition all of their parts for each song. Rhythm guitar does not need to take any solos, and only needs to be able to sing How Far We've Come, Dreams, and Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting). Keys only need to play on the three songs previously mentioned, and sing on the other two. Bass players do not need to audition backing vocals, simply indicate that you are capable of doing it.\n\nIf you have made it this far and decided that you want to be a part of this project, awesome! Here are your next steps:\n\n1. DM me indicating your interest, your role of choice, your general availability over the next 3 months, and how you meet all of the criteria listed above as well as any additional information you feel like sharing about yourself. I will then provide you a time frame (and any potential changes to the audition set, if any occur) in which you are allowed to submit your audition material to me. DO NOT SEND ME YOUR AUDITION MATERIAL ALONG WITH YOUR INITIAL MESSAGE INDICATING YOUR INTEREST OR I WILL RULE YOUR SUBMISSION AS VOID.\n2. After I give you a deadline to submit your audition material, you are free to submit it at any time before the deadline. You can submit it in spurts, all at the same time, etc., but it must be live footage of you playing the songs in real time to a backing track. I will judge you based upon the level of energy that you put into playing the songs as well as the accuracy to which they are played based on the original version. Obviously, you must submit the audition before the deadline is up, otherwise, you will be excluded from being a potential band member.\n3. After you submit your audition, please wait for me to reach out to you. If I invite you out to coffee or lunch, it means I'm very interested in you joining the band. We will go from there.\n\nThat's all everyone! Thanks for taking the time to read through this and if any of you have questions about this post do not hesitate to ask as I will be happy to answer them. Additionally, if any bands are looking for a lead guitarist/vocalist I am willing to do it, but understand that the main reason I'm posting this is because I'm more interested in forming my own project. Also, if any of you want to talk guitar or music feel free to DM me, I'm always down for a friendly chat :)",

    "postText": "I was recently admitted to Dartmouth RD and with the goal of becoming a chemical engineer in the future. I know Dartmouth has a BE modified w/ chemistry option that I could get in place of a chemical engineering degree and was wondering if anyone has any experience with it? I\u2019m really trying to determine whether I want to stay in-state (Clemson) and graduate debt-free or attend Dartmouth or Rice (~$70k in student loans assuming I graduate in four years). Can anyone vouch for how difficult it may be to complete the BE modified with chemistry in that time? Do you think the return on investment would make Dartmouth (or Rice) worth it?",

            "comment": "I was a Dartmouth Engineering Major (AB, not BE), but had friends do the BE in 4 years and also do it 5 years -- I believe Dartmouth offers scholarships for the fifth BE year but you have to check.  You could also do the AB in Engineering modified with Chemistry (or vice-versa, based on your interests).  I do feel the people who did the BE in four years did miss out on taking classes in Dartmouth's other great departments like Computer Science, Physics, and Geology.\n\nIf you did the BE, you would use your BE year to specialize in Chemical Engineering.  I'm sure the Thayer Course Catalog describes these paths.  I wanted breadth so i didn't pursue the BE and it didn't matter for me or my chosen fields.  Though it might matter if you need to be a certified Engineer.  \n\nChemical Engineering is a broad field, so it also depends what you want to specialize in.  If it is Biological Chemical Engineering, Tilman Gerngross is a legend in the field and started several successful companies like GlycoFi and AdiMab.  Lee Lynd is a rockstar in renewable fuels.  If it's for natural resources, Dartmouth opened the Irving Center funded by the Irving Oil Family and i'm sure there will be interesting classes, opportunities, and internships for undergraduates in both engineering and policy.  The great thing about Dartmouth is Professors are actually willing and excited to work with undergrads and it's very easy to get involved in great research and get great career advice and mentoring.  Thayer is growing their graduate program, but it is still very undergraduate focused.\n\nLastly, I for sure thought I was going to be a math major after graduating from high school.  After my first year, i realized i loved Engineering which I thought would never happen!  During my internships and corporate recruiting, i then decided to work in consulting/finance versus working in tech.  At Dartmouth, you don't need to declare your major till Sophomore year and many of friends figured out things late based on their interests.  I feel many of the pathways I chose were only available at a place like Dartmouth such as my internships and working in consulting/finance. \n\nI am biased, but loved Dartmouth Engineering and definitely feel the ROI is worth it (For both your learning and career options).  \n\nCongrats on being admitted to Dartmouth -- it is an achievement and good luck!",

This happens to almost everyone, although certainly not you, how could that happen? But if it were to, Dartmouth's better than Clemson. \nAll the rest is true, too, but this is an essential point.",

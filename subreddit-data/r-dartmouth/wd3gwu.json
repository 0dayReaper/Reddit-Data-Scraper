Like other user said, there is a high median but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a layup- you will be learning a shit ton of characters. If you know a little bit of chinese, I would recommend taking 4- it\u2019s a bit accelerated but it gets you through the sequence faster. If you are starting from scratch, chinese 1 is a good place to be.",

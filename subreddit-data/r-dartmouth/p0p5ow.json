But don't overthink it, just wear comfortable clothes to class that suit your personal style and don't be sloppy for the profs' sakes",

I took one AM class that met in the East Wheelock cluster (one of the professors was one of the professors who lived in the house next to EW), and so it was not uncommon for some of the students who lived there to come to class in PJs. And some folks come to class reasonably dressed up (not coat and tie or anything, but button-up shirts/khakis and the like). The vast majority fall in the middle.",

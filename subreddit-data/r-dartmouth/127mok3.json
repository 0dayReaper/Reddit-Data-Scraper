    "postText": "Hi! I got into Dartmouth for Arts and Science and NYU Tisch for Dramatic Writing. For context, both gave amazing financial aid offers, so tuition isn\u2019t an issue. My parents will pay for either one. I\u2019m very conflicted right now. I want to become a screenwriter. I truly LOVE Dartmouth\u2019s creative writing program, but NYU Tisch specifically has my screenwriting major. I\u2019m coming to Dimensions at Dartmouth soon and that\u2019ll probably help me decide!! Any thoughts?",

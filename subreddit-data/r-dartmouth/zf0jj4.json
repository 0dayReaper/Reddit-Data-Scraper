    "postText": "Guys I have received the email regarding Fin Aid too and looking through all the threads even one from 2009. it seems like there is enough evidence to suggest that there is a strong correlation between receiving the email and getting in, a pretty STRONG one!. \n\nI know that some people argue that it might just be a coincidence and there isnt enough data on people who did receive the email and still got rejected, it doesnt make sense bcz I believe every and every single student out there count and take everything they receive from any admissions office via email or otherwise SERIOUSLY. the first thing I did when I received the generic email( although I had submitted all the necessary documents prior and they were ticked too), I jumped on google and typed in what I had received. I think everyone who received the email would have shared their outcomes both positive and negative. and we can see from all the past and present threads that the overwhelming majority have cited the strong correlation. \n\nplease everyone share your thoughts on this!!\n\nI am hoping for the best for every single one of you!! may we all earn what we deserve",

I read all the earlier threads, but what's missing are the people that got rejected and received an email. If you are denied, you move on with your life and most likely don't want to post about getting rejected. For the good of future applicants, one should consider posting if there is a rejection after email.",

It now includes the employer statements of both my parents and the Signed Custodial Parents' 2021 Income Tax Return being waived since my country doesn't file taxes.  Then all the dates changed to 12/07. Is it a good sign similar to the email? I haven't received any email but I think it's because I submitted everything correctly.",

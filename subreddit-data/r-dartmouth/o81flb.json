    "postText": "Hello All,\n\n1) How are internships/experiential learning opps at Dartmouth funded for students not on financial aid? I see that there are grants that students need to apply to for some internships (up to $5000), are grants the only way to obtain funding? \n\n2) How often are internships located outside of N.H.? If it is outside of N.H., does the school facilitate room/board/travel for such internships, or do students have to make their own arrangements?\n\n3) Do students receive grades for internships/experiential learning, or are they completely for additional enrichment only?\n\nThank you so much!",

Did that with 2 different profs.\n2. Rock your frosh-soph GPA and you qualify for the Presidential Scholar (name?). Year-long paid research with a prof.\n3. Lots of other ops will come your way via the listservs. Apply.\n4. Walk the halls in the departments and read the bulletin boards.",

Maybe someone else will chime in on that. Also you can be strategic in what profs you approach. See which ones have connections to think tanks and work on contacts with that prof (taking a class is an obvious way). And then you can just look for internships and apply. \n\nYes D-plan means that you'll have a F, W or Sp term off. If you do F or Sp off that means you'd have 6-months for an internship.",

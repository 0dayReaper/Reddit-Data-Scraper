The ideal backdrop for concentration and relaxation that help me slow down, relax, and stay focused during my late-night study sessions. Hope this can help you too ! \n\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0QMZwwUa1IMnMTV4Og0xAv?si=yFZanA7sQVGhoNSeQ4UXZw](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0QMZwwUa1IMnMTV4Og0xAv?si=yFZanA7sQVGhoNSeQ4UXZw) \n\nI'm curious to discover yours, feel free to share \n\nH-Music",

You get private toilets and showers, a big closet, air conditioning, a snackbar across the quad, and an elevator. The only drawbacks are that the building is a bit far from the center of campus (like 7-8 minute walk to foco) and that your hall might not feel socially cohesive since only first floor Bildner has its own common room. You\u2019ll definitely be comfortable living there, it just might not end up being your social hub (and that\u2019s ok! I found lots to do elsewhere lol)",

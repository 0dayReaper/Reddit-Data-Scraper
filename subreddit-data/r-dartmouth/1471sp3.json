I have no idea what time of day they release, but based off of them coming out the 10th last year, it\u2019s reasonable to guess they might come out tomorrow, Monday 6/12. I\u2019m going to be checking all throughout the day, but if you have limited time to do so, I\u2019d recommend checking at 2PM and 6PM. Good luck, hope to see you in Hanover this summer!",

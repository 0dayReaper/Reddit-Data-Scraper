    "postText": "I go to Castleton in Vermont right now as a sophomore and, with the full understanding that I have no shot, I'd still like to do my best to be a great candidate to transfer to Dartmouth.\n\nThings going for me are a 3.8, current internship, 6 years of work experience at the same place, pilot's license, trilingual, and probably a few other things I can play up.\n\nMy plan is to get on a grind and do some case competitions for finance (area of interest), join a few clubs, do volunteer work in my town, and to get another internship.\n\nNow no matter what, doing these things would obviously help me get into a better school, but for Dartmouth specifically, is this a sound plan or are there more important things I should focus on?",

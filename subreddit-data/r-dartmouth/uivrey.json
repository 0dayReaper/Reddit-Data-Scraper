Do yk of ppl who did?\n\nAlso some background Abt me, my parents did force me to guitar school as a kid but I hated it and have forgotten most of it.",

If you\u2019re interested in strings, it would be worth reaching out to Marcia Cassidy, who could talk to you more. The woodwind teachers are especially friendly and open to beginners - the bassoon teacher is willing to teach bassoon as a new instrument to anyone interested!",

But if the studio is too full beginners are lowest on the list of priority. I suggest emailing the prof you want to take lessons with and ask if you can take beginner\u2019s lessons. https://music.dartmouth.edu/people",

I'm a hs senior and Dartmouth has been one of my top choices for a long time and I really like the school but yesterday I came across this: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/118wUTYzywXyAIh3fkavZVMUocL6DTZJzcpax8iV467I/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/118wUTYzywXyAIh3fkavZVMUocL6DTZJzcpax8iV467I/edit) and... yikes. After reading it I'm not sure if I even want to bother applying anymore but I wanted to hear other people's opinions (particularly those of Dartmouth students) too. Any input would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "From skimming through, it's a lot of stuff that either isn't true or is true of colleges/society everywhere. The list of \"normalized things to do when you're drunk\" didn't have anything in it I would describe as normal at Dartmouth (ironically, the only time I had serious issues with someone like that was when a visitor from a different school broke into my friend's dorm while blacked out). Some of the other points are not only untrue, they're kind of offensive. The author states \"Socializing at dartmouth for girls is basically like going through sorority rush 24/7 !!! EW.\" I think most women at Dartmouth would not agree with the implication that all of their deep friendships are the same as surface-level five minute conversations you're forced to have with fifty different people. The point about anti-intellectualism is particularly egregious; Dartmouth has an unbelievable undergraduate research program that a huge proportion of the student body (including Greek-affiliated people) participates in, and it's hard to accept the claim that those people are not intellectual or interested in learning. Dartmouth is also not conservative. Biden won 86.6% of the Hanover vote this year, and Clinton won 85% in 2016. It's blindingly liberal, with a couple of loud and obnoxious conservatives.\n\nSure, privilege exists, attractive people mostly hang out with other attractive people, being in greek life improves your professional network, and some dumbasses had parties during covid. None of that is great, and all of it exists at every college in the US.\n\nThe author makes fun of it, but our greek system (while far from being perfect) really is dramatically different from any school that my high school friends went to. Sexual assault is definitely a problem on campus, but it is one that the school is actively trying to work on. The doc seemed to imply that greek houses were not doing anything about it, which is not true. Fraternities have prioritized quarterly trainings for members, as well as collaborations with sororities to improve safety. Again, there is a ton of work to do here and I think this is a legitimate question, but students are working to change this.\n\nI would encourage you to do research and find out more on your own. It's sad that the author did not enjoy their time at Dartmouth, but while I think there are fair criticisms of Dartmouth and Greek life, the vast majority of the doc seemed to be things that aren't unique to Dartmouth or that I don't feel are accurate.",

                            "comment": "Hey, thanks for responding!\n\nI do agree with you that the \"different\" greek life is definitely used as a way to avoid talking about structural ways that it can be improved, but wanted to make the point that there is a difference. \n\nI want to push back on the PR point though, because when I was affiliated that wasn't really the perspective I saw. Generally the approach during meetings internally and collaborations with sororities was that we wanted to find ways to make our social space safer by reducing the incidence of people drinking too much, making people feel like there were people in the house they could go to with concerns/to point out anything inappropriate happening, etc. It's a win for everyone if we have a safer/more welcoming space, so there wasn't really any incentive for us to do things just for kudos. \n\nEven from a cynical point of view, I think only actual change provides benefits to greek houses in this context. I don't think people decided where to rush/where to go on nights out based on which houses ran MAV trainings, implemented extra duties, or made changes to house practices, but it does benefit Greek houses and the people attending them if people don't drink too much or the social space is generally safer because of those changes (it's great for a house if they're able to cut someone off before they black out and get hurt, or if they're informed about someone being inappropriate and are able to throw them out).\n\nYour main point regarding advertising to potential students I completely agree with. I do think the admissions office/administration should be more open with prospective students about the presence of Greek life on campus and the hold it has over the social scene. I don't think this is a problem that's exclusive to Dartmouth, but I think it's something where admissions should bite the bullet and lose some applicants in exchange for avoiding people ending up at Dartmouth and really disliking it based on the presence of Greek life.",

Frat members jeered from their front porch at a diminutive friend on summer exchange and in unison yelled \"midget crack\" at her. Women bussed in from women's colleges for a dance were greeted by three guys in chairs with scorecards to rate their looks as each got off the bus, like an olympic competition. It was common to call coeds \"co-hogs\" (quahogs, a kind of clam).\n\nThere were a couple fairly welcoming frats -Gamma Delt (back when it was all potheads) and Phi Psi. I tried to join Gamma Delt, where a lot of my friends were and where I hung out all the time, but got turned down because I was gay. Even though they desperately needed members. Didn't feel as comfortable hanging out there after that.\n\nNot surprised the frats are still a problem. Not surprised they haven't gotten rid of them. Great training for people who will go on to join country clubs.",

I was unaffiliated so cannot comment on whether the Greek system is\"different\" from others, but I see it as very inclusive. I very often hung out at frats/sororities, and I felt welcome at each. I have never seen any evidence of mysogny or racism. I wouldn't say I was very high on the social \"ladder\"generally speaking lol.\n\nI would not say that the student body is apathetic and  unintellectual. Imo a car majority of students are highly intellectual, even if they are frequenting greek houses on the weekends. Plus, there are so many different communities that you can be a part of, even if greek life isn't your thing! (Most of mine were related to volunteering, research, and music. Of course, I understand that people's experiences will vary, and these are personally my observations.\n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to PM me!",

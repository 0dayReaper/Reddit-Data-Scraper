I wanted to place out of calc 3 (13) by self studying and taking the placement exam, which is a totally valid option. \n\nAs Big Green said, you can take the placement exam. It\u2019s a multiple choice exam administered on canvas. I think you need a 70% to place out, but bear in mind the questions are pretty tough. Worst case you fail but know everything in the course, highly recommend it",

If you\u2019re attempting to pass out of the Math 8 (thus giving u placement into multivariable calculus), you do not have to do double/triple integrals. I wanted to pass out of multivariable calculus so I could get placement into linear algebra. \n\nThere should be a detailed list of stuff u need to know to get into multivariable.",

I just wanted to see if anyone knew an easily accessible location to fish close to campus? I don't wanna take away any of your fishing spots, but I just want a nice relaxing place to fish on the weekends :D\n\nAlso, if you wanna go fishing just DM me and we can go on an adventure!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Within walking distance of campus, you can just head down to Ledyard and fish off the bulkhead. I caught a lot of yellow perch and rock bass there. If you\u2019re not above slinging bait, you\u2019ll reel one in on practically every cast using a nightcrawler, otherwise you can try spinners. You could also rent a canoe and then paddle down ~15 minutes to where Mink Brook enters the CT River. I\u2019ve seen people pull out pretty sizable bass and pike there. \n\nWithin driving distance there\u2019s a decent number of ponds and rivers to try out. The White River offers some really great trout fishing if you have a fly rod. I never fished there, but Grafton Pond is really beautiful and likely supports a robust fishery based on its size and some of the structure there. \n\nBait and Bullet doesn\u2019t run as many fishing trips as you\u2019d hope, speaking from experience. Their main trip is a fly trip to the Grant that happens once or twice a year. Amazing to visit the Grant, but the fishing can be hit or miss depending on season and whether someone really knows the pools up there.",

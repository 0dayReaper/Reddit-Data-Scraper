            "comment": "Note that the locations of the boundaries between those towns are not midway between their downtown centers.  So you can be at a West Lebanon address, but be closer to Hanover than to West Lebanon proper, for example.  \n\nAlso note that West Lebanon includes a little town center area that has a nice library, and a kind of run-down strip of shops, but then also includes the complex of large strip malls and big box stores clustered around the intersection of two interstates.  So when people talk about going to West Lebanon to go shopping they are usually talking about that area of strip malls, not the actual town center.\n\nIf you think of that set of three communities as a triangle, dhmc is kind of opposite West Lebanon, so for convenience, Lebanon and Hanover are a little better.  Both have small walkable downtown areas.  Lebanon is generally less expensive,  and Hanover has a more upscale downtown area.\n\nThe three you mention seem like good options, on the leg of the triangle between Hanover and Lebanon.  There's some shopping including what's probably the best supermarket in the area in the Centerra center across from DHMC.  I don't know those in particular, but timberwood is better situated if you want to walk or bike to work or groceries sometimes or always.",

I live right next to the hospital fwiw, but affordable housing is definitely in short supply in Hanover. \n    \nStrong disagree with the comment regarding Hanover groceries. The Co-op is very good and fairly priced. Maybe 10% more expensive then the chain supermarkets, but its worth it.\n    \nTimberwood units are kind of shitty. I haven't been in the other two.",

            "comment": "I recommend Timberwood commons. The apartment complex is right by DHMC, there\u2019s a shuttle stop right in front of the building, and it\u2019s a quiet area. The apartment units are really nice; not super high end, but pretty modern for the upper valley, spacious, all have balconies. There\u2019s also an indoor garage on premise as well as a small gym and outdoor grills. \n\nOne main downside is you do need a car to get to restaurants/grocery since you can\u2019t really walk to any of the destinations, but they are only a short drive away.",

There is also a Co-op right next door for groceries (although a little expensive compared to Hannafords/BJs). And for restaurants, there's a place called Snax nearby. Incredible atmosphere, delicious apps, and unrivaled customer service.",

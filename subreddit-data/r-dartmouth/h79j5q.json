    "postText": "Over the past few months, a few of us seniors at Dartmouth got together to disrupt the dating world. We came up with Winged: Dating.\n\nSpecifically at Dartmouth we all know how prevalent the hook-up culture can be, and so we want to provide a platform for students where they can go on real \"virtual dates\" with people who are also looking for something substantial and lasting!\n\nYou match for times when you're available for a date, chat and get to know your match, and then schedule a virtual date (video call, in-app games, and helpful conversation starters/your date's interests if things get awkward).\n\nHead over to our [medium article](https://link.medium.com/CfqnF7oqb7) to get to know us a little bit more, and if you want us to be your wing\\[man\\]app then you can find us on the iOS app store, [\"Winged: Dating\"](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/winged-dating/id1507607706).\n\nPlease let us know if you have any feedback for us to improve, we are always looking to provide a better experience for our users.\n\np.s. every aspect of the app is free, and apart from the basic user information we do not track any other information about our users",

I'm an alumni, but I'm curious to see how this idea/app develops since it is something that has existed in some form on campus before.\n\nI'm blanking on the original website, but someone made a quick online dating platform just for Dartmouth students when I was in school (I'm a 12, who finished up courses in fall 2013. You could express interest and interact privately with people you like via PM.\n\nI like that your app takes this general idea into account, but I'm wondering if the scheduling aspect makes the process of virtual dating almost cumbersome. \n\nWhat is the follow through rate for scheduled interactions? Do you notice a lot of reschedules?\n\nThis is a really interesting app and it's always great to see Dartmouth creators doing their thing.",

But you raise a good point about scheduling, we had initially intended this app to be for in-person dating rather than virtual but due to covid-19 had to shift a bit. We'll be making some changes to the app throughout the summer and plan to re-release when term begins again in the Fall with both virtual and in-person being offered and will evaluate then.",

I'm a prospective international student from india looking to connect with my fellow FLIs on campus and talk to them about a few things to confirm the stuff I've found off over the internet. I understand you all might be busy and if anyone is up for this I'd be really grateful!!",

            "comment": "The questions are mainly:\n\u2014 The FYSEP is supposed to be only for selected first-gens as I've seen. There is also said to be no criteria for it. Does anyone know how you get selected as a part of the program? More importantly, is it just for domestics or intls as well?\n\u2014 What is Prepare to Launch Program? Beem hunting for days but the site is a dead end on it.\n\u2014 Are there any active FLI communities on campus that are making initiatives other than just dartmouth? Is there any actual ongoing initiative right now? The initiative that's most likely not mentioned anywhere yet bc it's not been implemented yet like prepare to launch.\n\u2014 Is Marketing EDGE not for undergraduates? I've been looking up the program and was curious as there is no marketing undergraduate program so idk if the initiative is for all first-gens or for ones who are receiving education higher than undergraduate.\n\u2014 Is America Needs You for international first-gens as well? The sites do tend to be vague about intl student participation and hence wanted to confirm.\n\nThese are all the main questions I want to confirm as I couldn't find anything concrete online. I thought it'd be best to ask instead of writing assumptions.",

                    "comment": "Hey! So the criteria for fysep is that you must be a first-gen, low income (an EFC of 0). ALL FGLI students are invited to apply, so both domestic and international students.\n\nThe Prepare to Launch Program is new; I\u2019m guessing that Jay and the First Gen Office (FGO) are still working on the details for that, and relating to your other question, the FGO usually handles most, if not all, of the FGLI events and opportunities\u2014 if that answers your questions about FGLI initiatives. If you want more information about the FGO, I\u2019d be happy to ask someone in office. You can also ask them as well. Their email is First.Generation.Office@Dartmouth.edu. We have a pretty close-knit, supportive community. This fall during family weekend, they organized an FGO family day for students with families that can\u2019t attend the weekend (or you can just come by and hangout with the rest of FGO).\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about America Needs You and Marketing Edge since they\u2019re organizations outside of Dartmouth. I\u2019d recommended emailing the individual organizations or the FGO about it.\n\nHope that helped!",

I'm glad to have asked. About the initiatives, I was just wondering if there is something new going on in the campus regarding the fgli. Is the FGO mail open during holidays?",

I was a FYSEP student in the first couple years and we were such a tiny program! By my senior year I was so happy to be a part of such a big community. We had a lot of overlap with ISO back then. Now it seems like there is a new program or feature to FYSEP/FGLI every quarter!",

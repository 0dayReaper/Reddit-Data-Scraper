For instance, my First Year Seminar also counted as my LIT requirement, and my Development Economics course counted towards my major, my SOC, and my NW.\n\nIn general, of the 35 courses one must take, around 1/3 are for distribution requirements, 1/3 for a major, and the other 1/3 to either complement the major, get a second major, or branch out with interest classes and potentially get a minor or two.",

This is outlined [here](https://students.dartmouth.edu/ugar/faculty/advising/resources/distributive-and-world-culture-requirements). This is regarding the B.A. in ENGS. The B.E. is separate and has separate requirements. Feel free to reply here or pm me if you have follow-up questions.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an international high school senior considering applying to Dartmouth this year. Although the academics look great, my main concern is the relatively rural area and I\u2019m afraid it could get boring real quick. I just had a few quick questions:\n\n1) Does it ever feel like the campus gets boring or there\u2019s nothing to do?\n\n2) Is greek life big and is it still possible to have a social life without getting involved?\n\n3) How friendly is everyone towards international students?\n\n4) If you\u2019re not too outdoorsy, would it be hard to fit in and still find things to do?",

            "comment": "1. It can get boring. That having been said, you can CHOOSE to have fun. If you like doing things beside the normal city college lifestyle of going to bars, you'll be fine. There's wonderful hiking, swimming (in good weather), a gym, pop movies at the Nugget and indie movies at the Hop, a lot of cheap &amp; accessible ways to make art, and of course lots of studying to do :)\n2. Greek life is huge. Zero way around that. That's because we only have one bar -- it's a tame little sports bar we got like a year ago. 60% of us are in Greek life, and even those who aren't (like myself) find themselves at frats more than once a week b/c they are the only social scene. Nearly everyone who comes to this campus who wants to not be involved in GL ends up  joining a sorority or frat. The positive is Greek life is quite different here than at most American schools. More laid back, I'd say. It's easy to get into GL parties. Just have some nerve and knock on the frat door. Worst they can say is no!\n3. People are generally friendly to everyone else! I don't know a ton of international students but all those I know enjoy it here. I also think they have their own support groups when they come here -- i.e. emailing lists and meet-ups, although I'm not sure.\n4. You can fit in while not being too outdoorsy for sure. But you may find yourself doing and enjoying more outdoorsy things.",

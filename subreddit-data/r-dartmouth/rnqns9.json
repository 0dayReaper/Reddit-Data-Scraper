    "postText": "Hey all.\n\nI saw that peer recommendation letters are \\*highly encouraged\\*, and so I'd like to get one from someone. \n\n2 of my friends are also applying to Dartmouth and also want peer recs. We have discussed exchanging rec letters in a triangle; I would write one for friend A, friend A writes for friend B, friend B writes for me. If we are all applying to Dartmouth, do you think the admissions office would think that the fact that we're all applying and using rec letters from each other is shady? Any thoughts and/or comments would be appreciated.\n\n(Also we all go to the same high school. So there's that too.)",

            "comment": "It\u2019s certainly a possibility that it would seem shady, especially in a triangle arrangement. But there is also another concern that isn\u2019t related to the admissions office: it\u2019s unlikely that Dartmouth would take more than one or two students from your school unless you are a feeder, and so you three would be nearly directly competing against each other. Do you really want your competition writing your recommendation?",

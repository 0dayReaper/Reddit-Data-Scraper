    "postText": "In a CS-modified major, you have a chance to study two subjects, if I understand it correctly; for example, Computer Science and Philosophy. In liberal arts education, you have a chance to explore as many subjects as possible. Then if Dartmouth is a liberal arts college, what is the benefit of declaring a modified major?",

            "comment": "Its just a glorified minor. Honestly minors are meaningless in the job market. Having a modified major lets you tout it a bit more than a minor because it will show up as your major. For example, I\u2019m a biology modified with chem. People may think it implies Biochem rather than just a biology major and chem minor, which is low key better in my mind!",

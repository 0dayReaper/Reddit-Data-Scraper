Those are the only flat parcels of land they own remotely close to campus. Any other space that\u2019s big enough would get delayed by prepping the landscape. It sucks that they\u2019ve dragged their feet so long on doing anything with the Lodge (which was always supposed to be overflow, but they\u2019ve used it increasingly for permanent housing).",

I don\u2019t understand how an Ivy League college could be so short sighted as to let their admissions run away and enroll too many students that they have to emergency build a dorm that doesn\u2019t meet any campus planning goals. Leadership should be a bit more organized than that.",

The moderate size of the student body is a huge part of what makes Dartmouth, well, Dartmouth: you can get to know a significant portion of your class without it ever feeling too cramped.\n\nNot to mention there's existing undergrad housing in dire need of renovation (Choates and River dorms come to mind) as well as an insane shortage of graduate housing.",

    "postText": "Dartmouth wants this: Science: 3 years of laboratory science with 4 years including physics for students considering engineering.\n\nI am not applying for engineering or STEM related majors, but I have 3 years of lab science, but I didn\u2019t take a fourth year because I wanted to take a second math class instead that was applicable to my major instead. Is it saying 4 years for engineering, or 4 years for everyone?",

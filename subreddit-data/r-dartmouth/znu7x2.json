Especially before we actually get there? Or even tips/strategies for when we do? \n\nI\u2019m a fairly social person, but am also moving across the country and am scared of being alone/not connecting with people who fit me. Any advice?",

            "comment": "Fun fact for all you incoming '27s, Dartmouth runs the Trips program to give you your ready-made orientation/fall semester friends...like the second you get to campus you'll be met by 8 other freshmen and 2 upperclassmen and you'll go on some sort of camping or outdoor trip with these \"trippees\" and a collection of other Trip groups. It's a really cool way to meet other people going through the same major life event, as well as some friendly upperclassmen for support and advice. Most people hang out with their Trippees and floormates for the first quarter and plenty of students remain good friends with at least one or two trippees throughout college. I think it's a fun program, but its greatest value is creating that community and making the college transition a little easier.",

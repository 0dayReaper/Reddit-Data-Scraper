    "postText": "Hii!! I was weaving through the courses and found **SPEE20.01**: Public Speaking and **ENGL 47/LING 18**: History of the English Language interesting. Are these classes suitable in terms of difficulty for a Freshman transitioning to a US education system?\n\nBoth were also listed as layups on layup list, and I'm sort of familiar with the syllabus. (Taking Writing 2-3 and ECON 1 with one out of the two).\n\nI'd reallyy appreciate any help/advice regarding course selection, thank you!!",

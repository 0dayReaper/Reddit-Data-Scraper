I\u2019m still deciding on major so I\u2019m open to anything. Just wanted to know what classes you guys found impactful or really enjoyed. Would also appreciate input on which First Year Seminars are really good. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I might be biased as a CS major but I think CS 1 (Introduction to Computer Science) is a super freshman friendly class and great for exploring the major. It definitely confirmed my interest in coding before going on to the much more intense CS 10 (wouldn\u2019t recommend taking it your first term even if you have some programming experience)\n\nAny course with Professor William Cheng is an absolute joy. He teaches the very popular Video Games and the Meaning of Life, which is by far one of the most impactful classes I\u2019ve ever taken (cross-listed in 3 departments too so very liberal artsy and peak Dartmouth). \n\nComparative Lit 1, Read the World, is another fun course to take. There was a lot of collaboration and helped me get to know some upperclassmen in my first term.",

            "comment": "In the Native American Studies department, I recommend taking anything offered by Professors Colin Calloway or Dale Turner. Great professors who are teaching important material. Originally, I took a course in the NAS department for the NW course distributive credit, but I enjoyed it so much, I took several others.\n\nIn the History Department, take anything you can with Annelise Orleck. In the Philosophy Department, Susan Brison is great.\n\nAnd for a specific course recommendation, I really enjoyed Russian 13--Slavic Folklore: Vampires, Witches and Firebirds. (Taught in English--no knowledge of Russian needed or used.)",

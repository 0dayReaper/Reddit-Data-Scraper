    "postText": "do any Dartmouth students know if the policy research shop is only open to public policy majors? I am writing my supplemental right now and would like to talk about some political program I can take part in and this one interested me, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s open to all majors. Let me know! Also if you have any social justice oriented program suggestions let me know \ud83d\ude01",

There is very much so a \"culty\" aspect to it, generally in a good way. \n\nYes, it also in a picturesque New England town, with many unique and special traditions (bonfire, winter carnival, etc.). It's the type of place where, if you buy in, you will look back on your time fondly and likely want to send your kids to in the future... there are a ton of dartmouth marriages and dartmouth families for this reason.",

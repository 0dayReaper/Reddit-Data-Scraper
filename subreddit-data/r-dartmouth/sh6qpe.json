    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming MEM in the Fall term this year (deferred 2021) \nI know it's probably early to be thinking about housing at this point so this post is just out of curiosity, any information is much appreciated! \n\nI wanted to know where the graduate students stay, is it like all together in Lebanon or is it scattered through the area? I also saw the new juniper housing and it looks really nice to me except i thought it was a little overpriced. But then again I don't know anything about the housing situation, so If any current grad could give any information or is okay with me dm'ing them for details that'll be really nice!! \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Welcome! I'm a first-year CS PhD. Being a grad student at Dartmouth rules, but unfortunately you aren't too early to start thinking about it because graduate housing is a huge issue that the GSC (grad student council) has been [working on for awhile](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pNj0rQ2D0_155wjHvQP1tqnDqVXD6nmm/view). It's hard to find (upwards of 25% of graduate students weren't able to find housing until *after July* for the fall 2021 term), it's expensive ([median rent is $1,350/month for an apartment](https://www.zumper.com/rent-research/near-dartmouth-college-nh)), and it's super stressful.\n\nJuniper is new this fall and I think a lot of people will be moving there since they just took away one of the other popular grad student housing options, North Park ([there's a good article about that situation here](https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2021/11/majzoub-dont-take-north-park-away-from-graduate-students)).\n\nSachem Village is cool, especially if you want to live by yourself or you live with a partner. Many graduate students with families live there.\n\nOther than those two options semi-provided by the college, you're on your own to find a place. In my experience the most active market is the [Upper Valley Rentals page](https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/upper-valley-rentals) moderated by the college, followed by Zillow or Facebook marketplace. People post looking for roommates on those, too, in addition to full apartments. Most of those listings are filled quickly (I signed for my apartment on *the day it was posted on Zillow*), and I'd say on average they're posted about a month before they're available.\n\nGood luck, though! I hope you find something easily. Housing really is the worst part of Dartmouth's grad community imho, everything else is awesome. People are awesome, there are a ton of outdoors activities around, it's a good place.",

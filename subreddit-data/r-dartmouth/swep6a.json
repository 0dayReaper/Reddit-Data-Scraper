    "postText": "Hey guys, I am a first year applicant to Dartmouth for the fall of 2022 cycle. I requested for an interview but they told me that they did not have enough volunteer for me to get an interview and as a result they denied my request. Honestly speaking, does this mean that I have basically a very low percent chance at getting accepted?",

More than likely it just means that whatever alumni interviewer you were assigned had something come up in their life that made them too busy to do the interview, and admissions couldn't find someone else to take their place before interview season closed. Nothing to do with you or the strength of your application, and it won't hurt your chances.",

They take them with a heavy grain of salt and not getting one says absolutely nothing about the application. Its literally random.",

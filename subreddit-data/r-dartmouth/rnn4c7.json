I've also heard of ASCL major modified with Econ (and you might be able to swing it the other way too) if you'd be interested in that, and honestly double majoring in ASCL and Econ is pretty doable too. I know at least three current students (there might b more) doing ASCL Chinese language track + Econ (and I'm personally ASCL Japanese + Econ but might switch to QSS). Might be difficult if you're looking to graduate with honors/write theses though lol. \n\nNow that I think about it, most of my friends doing ASCL (language track majors at least) are double majors so I wouldn't be too worried about minoring.",

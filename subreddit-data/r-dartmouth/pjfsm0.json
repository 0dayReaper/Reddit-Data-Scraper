    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm a prospective '26 and I'm thinking about applying to Dartmouth, but I have some questions:\n\n1. Is hazing common/a big issue at Dartmouth?\n2. How often do students go out and party realistically?\n3. Are there nerdy/geeky kids at Dartmouth? I heard somewhere there's an \"anti-intellectual culture\" at Dartmouth, but I'm guessing this isn't true.\n4. Will I fit in if I'm not super into partying? I'm not against it, I'm just not the hugest partier out there\n5. Do you have to be really experienced with nature to enjoy the DOC events?\n6. Engineering/CS grads: did you ever run into a problem with employment since you technically have a BA and not a BS?\n\nThank you!!",

            "comment": "Hey! I'll go in order:\n\n1. No it isn't. It gets a lot of media attention when it does happen, for obvious reasons, but it is not common.\n\n2. In COVID, hopefully not at all, but I've heard it's been happening. Pre-COVID, that depended on the student. Some people were out raging more than half the nights of the week. Other people, only weekends. And others, none at all. Each person finds the balance they want, that's up to you.\n\n3. Definitely not true. We may crack jokes about people studying too much amongst ourselves, but at the end of the day, we're all driven students and have particular subjects we're passionate about.\n\n4. Yes, for sure. There are plenty of people who don't rage. And to go back to my answer in #2, you'll find the balance for you and other people who share that balance with you.\n\n5. Definitely not!!! There are DOC outings for all levels of experience. You can find entry-level trips for whatever activities you want. I'd highly recommend going on a Diner Tour trip at least once.\n\n6. I did an AB/BE and no, if you take the necessary steps to gain technical experience (i.e. clubs, projects, and/or internships), then you should have no trouble getting employed. I was pre-med and ended up committing to medicine, but I was able to get an offer at a product design firm with my AB/BE.",

Collis is always having something, doc has trips almost daily, too many clubs to count. I was super hesitant about being up here too but once you\u2019re a student here you\u2019ll realize how much stuff is always going on",

            "comment": "1. Not as far as I'm aware, at least at most places. I think these days the \"hazing\" is more like waking a pledge up at 3am with a song or making him shake hands with every brother he sees. But I don't personally have experience.\n2. It depends. I know people who go out every day of the week (?!?!) and people who don't go out at all. My freshman year I went out 2 days a week. I was not a partier at all in high school, either.\n3. I am surprised you heard there's an anti-intellectual culture -- that has not been my experience at all! Some people here are so smart they don't have to study at all. Other people have to work pretty hard (like me) and spend all their time in the library, and of course my boyfriend will tease me about it. But at the end of the day, most of us are here because we like what we're studying. As a result, there's plenty of what you would call \"geeks.\"\n4. There's definitely a contingent of people who aren't into partying, and you will be able to find them. I was friends with multiple people my freshman year who didn't drink. And they all rushed (some of the co-ed frats, like Phi Tau, aren't big drinking scenes).\n5. You don't. The DOC people are welcoming and always happy to help. I went to timber team practice on a whim one day and they taught me how to throw an axe. I sucked at it but it was awesome.",

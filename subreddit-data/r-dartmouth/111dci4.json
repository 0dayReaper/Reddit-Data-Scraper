    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm a junior in high school. I toured Dartmouth last summer, and I loved it. I loved the campus vibe, people, and I wanna go into IB, so it's a great fit. For academics, I have a 4.6 weighted, 4.0 unweighted with all AP classes, and a 1450 sat. For extracurriculars, I am the captain of the Varsity soccer team, started an investment club at my school, NHS treasurer, and I did an internship at a hedge fund last summer (Family friend, but they don't know that ig).  I am also big into competitive sports, so I started a nonprofit that sponsors one boy and girl for each of our local sports teams so they can afford the fees to play. The person I did an internship for best friend is a manager of the Dartmouth Endowment and said he could get me an internship with him if I wanted. I want to do it, but I would have to go up north and stay up there for most of the summer. Could this help me get into Dartmouth and make up for my low SAT scores? Thanks for the help!",

If moving up to NH is something you want to do for the summer that\u2019s great. If you\u2019re doing it just for Dartmouth I don\u2019t know that the location of your internship will move the needle. Apply ED. Pursue your passion\u2026expand the non-profit to have more impact and be sure it lives on after you. This shows that you didn\u2019t do it for college, but for the students it can support. Be authentic.",

It also depends if 1450 is after a lot of studying (like your current ceiling), or if it's with low to moderate studying. I was accepted ED this year with a 1480, so SAT isn't everything.",

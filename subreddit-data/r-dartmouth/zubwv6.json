The whole point is that you actually have to put in work doing independent research in order to come up for yourself why you want to attend Dartmouth. It would be understandable if you asked specific questions in order to glean information impossible to find on the internet, through youtube, other Reddit posts, or Dartmouth's many blogs (which literally answer the why question). Your motivations based on your background and interests will be totally different to other people's.",

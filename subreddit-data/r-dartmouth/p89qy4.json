    "postText": "Hello! Im a rising high school senior that is considering EDing to Dartmouth and I am very interested in what the club sport scene is like at the college, especially Rugby.  I couldn\u2019t find much online so I was wondering if anyone had any insight here. How often do these teams practice? Do students not take them seriously or are they similar to varsity sports in terms of commitment? And what is the community in these teams like? Thank you in advance to everyone who replies!",

            "comment": "It varies a lot depending on the sport. Men's rugby is basically a varsity team in terms of competition and commitment. I played club soccer, and we were not that intense, but had a solid 3 practices per week, plus weekend games. Others (squash, tennis) are more like tennis club, where people meet a few times a week to do drills and play casually with much less competition against others school.\n\nPlease note, some of this could have changed.",

The fencing team is fairly rigorous; we compete against some varsity schools. I know women's rugby players (I think club? Not sure...) who are pretty serious. \n\nIn general, I've found that club sports athletes are under much less pressure than varsity, but still have a group of super dedicated athletes.",

            "comment": "I'm a '15, so things might have changed, but the mens rugby commitment was pretty similar to a varsity sport when I was there. Depending on the term, 2-3 practices, 2 lifting sessions, and sometimes a pool session per week. And then one game per week in fall (and more games in spring if you do sevens). Club rugby got to use the varsity gym when I was there, so that was really nice, and the rugby pitch is one of the best in the country. It's a big commitment that the team takes seriously, but if you're a rugby newby you'll start learning the game in separate practices with the other freshmen.\n\nUntil you're good enough to play for the first or second XV, you have a bit of leeway, and the time commitment is lower (maybe 2 practices per week plus the odd exhibition game when one can be arranged; I can't remember if new freshmen have formal lift sessions or not).\n\nThere'll be a lot who join in the first couple weeks who drop out as the term goes on. Those who show the most dedication (and talent) will be \"promoted\" to the second XV, and then you have most of the time commitment I mentioned in the first paragraph. If you've already played rugby and know the game, you might start out with the second XV (or first if you're very good). The community is very close and it's definitely possible to make club rugby your main social group, but relative to varsity sports I think there are a lot more guys who are in other social groups as well\n\nLess knowledgeable about women's rugby (I don't know if you're looking for info about the mens or women's team). Honestly a bit of a shame when I was there that there wasn't much interaction between the men's and women's teams. They were less serious than the men's team when I was there, but I know they've improved a ton since I left, so I imagine that changed\n\nBig caveat that this was all 6-10 years ago now, so things could have definitely changed on the men's side too\n\nEdit: feel free to dm me if you have any questions",

Im glad to hear that there is a close community fostered within the club team and that the people who stick it out are dedicated to the sport. I just had a couple more questions if you don\u2019t mind answering. Is the first XV the varsity team and the second XV the club team or does the club team itself have a first XV, second XV, etc.? Also who does the club team play against? Is it like the varsity team where they travel to other ivies or do they just play local teams in the area? Also yes to specify I was talking about the mens team. Thank you!",

Dartmouth always has a first and second XV, plus the freshmen team in the fall (at least if it's the same as when I was there)\n\nIn the fall is the Ivies competition, so it's league play against all the other Ivies, and then the winner of the Ivies will go on to regional and then maybe national competition (usually playing against Army, Navy, Penn State, etc. Some of those teams might be varsity). There was also usually an exhibition tournament at the beginning of the year against non-Ivy teams (McGill, Queen's, and sometimes UNH or another northern college)\n\nWinter is just practice, at a reduced schedule\n\nSpring is for finishing up national championships if your team is very good, and then sevens, also against the Ivies, and then better teams if you win the Ivies",

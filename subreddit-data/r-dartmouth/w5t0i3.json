    "postText": "Current 22' bounder here, and I was wondering if Dartmouth Bound was influential in the Regular Decision round or just the ED round. I'm stuck between Dartmouth and Upenn ED, but Upenn is my first choice. If Dartmouth bound is a virtual acceptance then I'll just wait until the reg. decision round, but if it only applies to the ED round then I'll just stick with Dartmouth and hope for the best. \n\n(This sentiment is based on the belief that bound has an influence at all, and it very well may not.)",

If I weee you, I\u2019d ED there regardless of how much Dartmouth bound helps because that\u2019s where you truly want to be!",

Bounders from previous years have gotten deferred and waitlisted, some even flat out rejected, but most do get accepted. (Source: I did Bound one year and got deferred ED and eventually rejected.)",

I thought I had a good app, but there were a lot of things I would've changed, esp in my personal essay. Don't let this discourage you though because a lot of my fellow Bounders got in Early Decision.",

It\u2019s a real paradise. \n\nBut it\u2019s rural. You\u2019re not gonna get every food option. The area is demographically overwhelmingly old and white. Boston Logan is two hours away. \n\nOn balance it might be the most wholesome undergraduate experience in the world. But it can feel a little isolated at times.",

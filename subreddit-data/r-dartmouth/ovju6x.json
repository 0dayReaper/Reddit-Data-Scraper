    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI\u2019m a rising junior and recently visited the campus. I throughly enjoyed it. I was looking at information about Dartmouth Bound, but I am unsure I would get in due to not being from an underrepresented background and thankfully having a good financial situation. I read that other students in a similar situation as me learned about Dartmouth Insight in their decisions for the program. I was wondering if anyone knew anything about it and could enlighten me? Thank you!",

There is a lot of work to do on your own, for example you need to learn hiragana in your own time and need to be able to read it in week 1. Classes start at 9:05 and drill starts at 7:45 which can be annoying for some people.",

Honestly, I'd try and learn it before you even take the courese. Hiragana isn't hard to learn, just have to learn it. I hate katakana though lol.",

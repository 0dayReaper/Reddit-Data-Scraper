    "postText": "When I was an undergrad, the joke was always that C&amp;A Pizza had to be a front. Who ordered from C&amp;As? People got EBAs (then Doms), people got Ramunto\u2019s. Nobody ever got C&amp;A pizza. I lived next to there for a year - never saw anyone eating inside, never saw anyone getting take out. Always empty. Okay fine, it\u2019s weird, the drug front bit is a good one, I moved on. \n\nRecently was back on campus and saw that just like for the past 45 years, C&amp;As is still going strong. And this time I really couldn\u2019t get past it. How DO they survive when so many other clearly more frequented businesses in town fail? I know a decent number of people who have lived in the Upper Valley for a long time, and they all say the same thing - it\u2019s not like locals are frequenting the place but students aren\u2019t. I just can\u2019t get over, from a business perspective, how they can keep operating. I\u2019d be shocked if they pull over $200-300 in revenue per day. I can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s enough to cover payroll, food supplies, overhead, etc. The only logical conclusion I can come to is that they own their building, so there\u2019s only property taxes to pay on it, and they don\u2019t actually care about turning a profit. Maybe it\u2019s not a front so much as an intentionally claimed business tax loss that\u2019s part of a much larger portfolio? This is starting to seem like the most likely to me. \n\nIf anyone has ideas I\u2019d love to hear them.",

The advice I have gotten so far as an econ&amp;CS major is to prepare to pass the placement test for maths and CS so I can skip one class in each (to spare time). I think they are CS 1 and Math 3 so basically I'm brushing up on calculus and starting python. \n\nApart from that I am as lost as I can be.",

But other than that, just relax and enjoy your summer. College is a distinct creature from high school, just go into it refreshed and relaxed",

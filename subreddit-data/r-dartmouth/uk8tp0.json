I was preparing for my country's entrance exams for colleges which is just a month away. Can I explain this to the admission officers or will it get me rescinded?",

Will you be resilient enough to endure the rigor and the 10-week quarter pressure at Dartmouth?\nYou should also ask yourself about this. Try to explain the situation to them and build a strong argument in order to avoid any trouble.",

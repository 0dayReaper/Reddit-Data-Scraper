It\u2019s just a name picked by the school and has no reflection on the content of the major.  Absolutely nobody will even notice if that letter is an S or A.  I majored in CS and not once in 30 years has that distinction made any difference.\n\nFun bonus fact: The school I\u2019m a professor at now only awards BS\u2019s.  So here, if you major in English, you get a BS.  Again, nobody cares.",

So some people have the mistaken impression that there are some sort of universal standards for what these degrees mean.  There aren't.  They are meaningless without the context of the specific school that granted them.  The context here is that many older schools like Darthmouth traditionally offer BAs even for STEM subjects, and that doesn't carry any fixed meaning that makes it a less rigorous degree than a one from a school that chooses to call it a BS.  If someone wanted to interpret these nuances, they'd have to research the institution that granted it.  But nobody actually cares.",

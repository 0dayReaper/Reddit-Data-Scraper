            "comment": "I went to a very hard HS, but college to HS is apples to oranges. Many of the classes at Dartmouth are hard, sure. But a big part of what made the classes hard for me at the start of college was learning how to manage my time. High school was super prescribed because you take a whole day of classes every day. At Dartmouth, you're taking between two and four classes a quarter, each of which meets 2-3 days per week (not counting STEM classes even though that's most of what I took). How you use the time outside of those few hours in class is up to you. You're also expected to think differently than in high school classes and to manage more of your own learning (e.g. attending office hours or studying with classmates).\n\nTake it at face value that Dartmouth is fast-paced and that the bar is fairly high for profs' expectations of your thinking and work. Don't try to compare it to high school because it's just fundamentally different",

It's easier to get away with in highschool but will almost certainly bite you in the ass at some point in college.\n\nI had a couple buddies that had a tendency to procrastinate, and there were several times they had to pull all-nighters to get their work done",

I was in the latter camp. If you plan on taking a competitive or difficult major, I can say that having classmates who are all basically as smart or smarter than you makes that strategy not very effective.",

We've created this thread for you to meet each other, ask questions to the rest of the community, and to celebrate!\n\nFor those looking before decisions have been released, please do not speculate or post about things like documents changing in your dashboard. Nobody benefits from this guesswork, and your real decision will come soon enough!",

            "comment": "What I wrote earlier about Dartmouth - just copying and pasting as it is chaotic right now.\r  \n\r  \n1. Similar to Princeton, they focus on undergraduate education, which is why they have the highest alumni donation rate and is honored year after year for their alumni network\r  \n\r  \n2. They\u2019re consistently one of the highest awarding within the Ivy League for financial aid\r  \n\r  \n3. Their undergraduate economics and government program ranked top 5 in the nation with millions invested and committed to advance their STEM departments (I believe they recently finished construction on their multi-hundred million engineering building)\r  \n\r  \n4. Per capita, Dartmouth is third behind Wharton and Harvard in terms of sending students to top finance and consulting firms\r  \n\r  \n5. Flexible undergraduate curriculum similar to Brown\r  \n\r  \n6. Their \u201csophomore summer\u201d program allows individual grades to experience Dartmouth among their cohort and is often cited as students\u2019 favorite memory of Dartmouth\r  \n\r  \n7. They own the 2nd most land after the state government in both Vermont and New Hampshire, granted by the colonial state governments\r  \n\r  \n8. Their Greek life is often deemed progressive due to the amount of houses, including those for LGBTQ , non-binary, etc, and their generous financial aid and rules deeming that every house must be open to visitors for parties without cost or restriction\r  \n\r  \nLet me know if you all think a blurb of other Ivies would be helpful.",

I'm not complaining, because I'm going to an absolutely awesome school anyway, but I just wanted to say thank you to all the Dartmouth students, you guys taught me so much throughout my childhood.  You were my babysitters, my math tutors, my mentors, my big sibs, my choir-mates, and my classmates.  Enjoy your time here, and good luck with everything. :)",

    "postText": "So my friends and I got into a discussion about the types of people who apply ED to different schools.  They think that your chances of being admitted ed are harder than rd because everyone who applies ed is a high caliber student. but I think that your chance is greater because all the top top students wouldn't bind with one school, they'd want to see all their options and apply to multiple top schools. So the people who ed are like the mid tier top students who are relying on the ed to get in; thereby, making your chances of being admitted ed greater. What do you guys think?",

ED acceptance rates are much higher than RD because of the reasons you mentioned, but also a lot of borderline applicants who got in ED would not have gotten in RD because of that demonstrated interest. If you're sure Dartmouth is the school for you and can financially afford to go there, I would take that small boost and apply ED. Just make sure you're application is ready by the deadline. I wasn't sure about any school so I didn't apply ED, but if I had a dream school, I would have.",

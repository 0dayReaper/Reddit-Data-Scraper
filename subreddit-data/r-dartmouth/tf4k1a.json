    "postText": "I'm applying RD for class of '26, and was looking through some college threads on Quora, Reddit, and College Confidential. Apparently if you applied for financial aid and Dartmouth contacted you or your dates for documents changed it was a sign you were highly likely to be admitted. \n\nI applied for financial aid, but I did not receive an email or date changes and I feel like I'm going to get rejected, since students who received nothing ended up getting rejected.\n\nDid anyone apply for aid but receive no communication beforehand? Sorry I'm just very anxious and a little disheartened since Dartmouth was one of my dream schools.",

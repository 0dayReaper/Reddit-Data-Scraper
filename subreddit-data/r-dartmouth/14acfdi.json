From a young age, I understood no one would position the world for me to succeed, and my parents would never stumble upon the fortune that would pay my way. Therefore, growing up in a small, majority-white town, I've always felt the need to work harder, do more, and be the best me. When I tell others I plan to attend a prestigious university and pursue an MD/Ph.D., they respond with enormous doubt. Friends and teachers look at my skin and where I'm from and shove me into their stereotypes, but I won't stay there. I must go on to change the world, not just to prove someone wrong but to show other girls facing the same plight as me that success is possible. Dartmouth is a remarkable institution that produces top performers in the fields I plan to study. I believe that the school could be the platform I use to propel myself into my future of opportunity and success. It's only natural that I want to explore the university, and Dartmouth Bound would allow me to do that. Being on the Dartmouth campus, even for a few days, would prepare me for the lifestyle I plan to immerse myself in after high school. In addition to this, the program would introduce me to a diverse community of hard-working, ambitious leaders to learn from and enjoy. As a member of this community, I'd provide the perspective of a low-income black woman from a rural town. The prejudice I've faced in the South and the hardships I've endured through a life of lacking combine to create a unique story that anyone would benefit from hearing. I genuinely hope for the opportunity to share it this summer.",

Also great emphasis on achieving.\n\nBest of luck to you -- I hope you **do** change the wild for the better!\n\nEDIT: I meant to type \"world\", but fat-fingers and auto-correct came up with \"wild\".

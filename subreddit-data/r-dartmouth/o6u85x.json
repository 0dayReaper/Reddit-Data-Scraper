            "comment": "people usually say to stay away from writing about topics that are too heavy (mental health, stuff like that) for college essays just bc if you write it a certain way, AOs may be on the fence abt you or wtv, so i probably wouldnt write about it. a general rule is that if you could write the essay and still kinda laugh, then you are far away from x thing that you could write about it without turning it into a tell all about your declining mental health. if you still cry about it or writing the essay makes you sad then you probably should choose a better (and lighter) topic",

            "comment": "Do NOT mention it if you want to stay on campus. If you have an eating disorder that is affecting your health in any way (like being just a couple pounds underweight or having something off in labwork) you WILL be put on medical leave. This has happened many times and it is very hush hush. It happened to two of my friends. In order to be readmitted she had to go through an in-patient program, the cost of which bankrupt her family to the point where she was unable to graduate. Furthermore, Dicks themselves claim to not have resources for eating disorders outside of the nutrition consultation. I now work as a college admin myself in student services at another college, and frankly, schools don't want anyone who is going to be a medical risk on campus. Try to recover before going to college, and ensure that you have a strong support system outside of the school but I would NOT recommend mentioning mental health struggles until you are admitted AND in recovery.",

Recovery is hard in general- only you can know if going to school far away is something you can handle or not. Please do not take my above comments to mean that you should just go to school without anyone knowing. On the contrary, you need to be responsible enough to have people who will hold you accountable to your recovery. But I would advise not to tell Dicks house (if you go to dartmouth), and certainly do not tell admissions officers or write your essay about it. As an applicant, you never want to say anything take makes you a medical liability in the eyes of the school. PM if you would like to talk further :)",

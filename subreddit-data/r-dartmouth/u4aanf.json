I\u2019m also nervous about making friends but what worked for me in the past is joining clubs that I care about, volunteering because I got to bond with people, and approaching people when they are alone to start small conversations. It will be okay :)",

Show up to club meetings early on and see if you like the activities and people\n3. Say yes to things. Someone asks if anyone wants to swim in the river? Yes. Someone asks if you want to try rock climbing? Yes. Someone wants you to play Fifa with them? Yes.\n4. Don't take yourself too seriously. Most everyone is trying to find themselves, things that seem monumentally bad in the present will generally just be a bump in the road in the future, the social circle is not as closed as it seems.\n5. Wear sunscreen",

The longer you stay in a discipline, the better your chance of meeting someone like you. \n\nIt\u2019ll happen eventually. Be patient and be open. \n\nAlso, go on your first year trip.",

    "postText": "Hey guys!! I\u2019m super pumped to join the class of 2027 next fall and just have a few questions that have been on my mind since getting accepted.\n\n1. I love hockey and hope to catch some games at Dartmouth. Is hockey fairly popular? I just need some fans and maybe a goal song. I don\u2019t care if the team is awful; after all, I am a Canucks fan.\n\n2. Is there any sort of welcome week when you first get to Dartmouth? I know with the quarter system there\u2019s less of a \u201csyllabus week\u201d when compared to other colleges but it would be nice to have some time to adjust and get to know my peers.\n\n3. I applied as a Creative Writing major so it would be great if anyone had any input for that department.\n\n4. Lastly, I bet that everyone asks about this, but what are the parties like? Someone told me once that Dartmouth has a state school type party atmosphere and I was wondering if that is true. I would be fine with whatever; I\u2019m just curious.\n\nI am so excited to meet everyone in the fall!!",

Here are the answers to your questions: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. We do have a sports analytics club that loves hockey. But if you want to play, highly recommend doing IM hockey! Really fun and costs $10 to register, but everything else is free!\n2. Yes. You will be overloaded with orientation stuff and information about that when the time comes. O-week consists of: tours, department open houses, and most importantly, First Year Trips!\n3. There is no creative writing major per say, but there is a concentration within the English Department as well as a minor (?). But regardless, the English department is amazing. As a math/stats guy, I didn't think I would enjoy the class I took as much as I did. \n4. \"Parties\" are whatever you make of them. Most \"on-nights\" (Wed, Sat, Sun) consists of open frats and pong, as well as some dance scenes. Go out, don't go out, Greek life is whatever you want to make of it if that makes sense. And some nights will be great fun, others wont. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

I work for the athletic department here and get to assist with stats for the game :) I would say it\u2019s semi-popular. \n\n2: yes, NSO is about a week long with activities, first year trips, etc\n\n3: sadly no\n\n4: to me, I wouldn\u2019t say they are as wild as a state school. They\u2019re okay, more of what you make of it I guess",

    "postText": "Hey, y'all! I know this sounds kinda cheesy, but I see all of these kids on  [r/ApplyingToCollege](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/) and r/chanceme and all I can do is cringe. To be frank, I don't know much about college admissions, as I haven't really had those people around me to guide me as much as my close peers, but I do realistically see myself being competitive.\n\nI know that the admissions process is a crapshoot and that especially with the Ivies, you can't guarantee anything. With Dartmouth, it has quite literally been my dream school for the past 2 years, and every aspect from the custom majors to the location makes me want to call it home for my 4 years of undergraduate studies. With that being said, I am looking to apply ED to Dartmouth this admissions cycle.\n\nAs I said, I'm a little new to this process, and with the right guidance, I hope that my resume, activities, grades, and essays can have the opportunity to shine through. I understand that college students are extremely busy, but if any of you has the time, please private message me and we can chat, and then exchange Discord ID's, phone numbers, emails, Snapchats, or whatever. I don't need much of a time commitment from you - I will contact you whenever necessary, but even if you respond with a brief message every other day, I will be immensely grateful!\n\nI know this is an odd request, but thanks in advance :)",

However, I had no coding experience in high school and am worried this class will be extremely difficult for me because of that. How can I get some exposure to coding so I can be prepared to take this class sometime this year?",

You can also try out the assignments and material on the [course website](https://cs.dartmouth.edu/~kvasanta/cs1/schedule/index.html) which is basically the same every year. If you\u2019re feeling extra anxious, try looking at or even doing some of the assignments ahead of time!\n\nThe key thing with learning programming is you need to actually practice out writing the code and running it and getting it to work. Fortunately projectpython allows you to run code directly on the site in each section so you can see where you get stuck.",

    "postText": "'25 Here\n\nScored a 5 on BC Calc junior year and didn't think it was terribly hard. Took multi senior year and did well but the class was terrible. I took a gap year after high school and after 2 years, I think I've forgotten pretty much everything I learned in either class. Should I take Math 8? Or do a little basic review and go into Math 11?",

I found 11 pretty chill for the first few weeks as it went over stuff I'd seen before in MV. Then it got harder as we got into stuff I hadn't seen before. But as someone who has seen the MV stuff, you'll have an advantage over those for whom it's brand new.",

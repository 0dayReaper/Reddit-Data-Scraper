    "postText": "TL;DR on Friday there was an incident near the college that prompted a shelter-in-place.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard:\n\n-around 9:50 on Friday, a person took a shot near the Christian Science Reading room (near Sigma Delta), grazing a non-Dartmouth student \n\n-There were reports of unconfirmed shots at collis, and around tuck drive, but these were false. These reports nonetheless prompted extensive police response from the area\n\n-One \u201cnon-Dartmouth student\u201d was grazed, but was taken to the hospital and is ok. I\u2019ve been told he was a student from Providence college up to visit a friend \n\n-Police arrested two suspects around 11:30 in Lebanon after a short car chase. They were driving a black Ford Fusion, which they crashed at the end of the chase. Both male, one was 17 years old, and the other was 22 years old. Unclear if they were connected to the events on campus \n\n-the shelter in place lasted around two hours \n\nI\u2019d like to say that Dartmouth is a very safe campus and that HPD and Campus Security did an excellent job of providing information and keeping people safe. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions and I\u2019ll try to update this thread as I learn more.

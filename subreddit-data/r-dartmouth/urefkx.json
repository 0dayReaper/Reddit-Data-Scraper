    "postText": "Was talking to my brother at Yale the other day and he told me that a lot of celeb kids go there. Is it really true that children/relatives of A-list celebrities/TV personalities etc are currently at Ivies/T10s but current students are supposed to be lowkey about them?\n\nWho are some celeb kids/kids of famous people/famous people at Dartmouth?",

Even if you do want to share stories of a current student, please be vague and respectful of their privacy - keep in mind that they still go to this school. Alumini stories are fine ig",

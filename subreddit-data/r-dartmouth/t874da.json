I'm sure she won't listen to my advice, but \n\n1.) layers instead of one solution - a waterproof/windproof shell (gore-tex, etc.) that goes over an insulation layer (down or synthetic puffy) that can go over other layers (sweater, fleece, turtleneck, etc. that can go over an undershirt (t-shirt, technical moisture wicking undershirt, etc.). with layers you can mix/match those to suit the changing weather, and you can increase/reduce layers as you transition between indoors/outdoors.\n\n2.) quality - we're not wealthy people, but I hike my dog every day, including on the coldest &amp; wettest days of the year so I've learned to not buy cheap for weather-related gear. once that was North Face but now that's Arcteryx imo.",

            "comment": "Good shoes are important. Something like insulated LL Bean boots that you can use to walk in snow/slush/etc.\n\nLong underwear also helps a lot. Lots of people will wear like 30 jackets and then just a pair of jeans and wonder why they're freezing, when a pair of thermals under the jeans would make all the difference in the world.\n\nAnd to contradict /u/DeutschKurzhaar: layers are absolutely the best (least bulky/most comfortable) way to stay warm when you're exercising or something. But for moving around campus where you're going to be spending most of your time inside, and just need to stay warm moving between buildings, I'd recommend a single big, heavy coat. That way when you get back inside you can easily just take off/carry around one thing, instead of having to peel off/put back on 5 different base layers each time you go in/outside. As far as which coat, it's pretty up to you. But if you're looking for a budget conscious solution I'd recommend contractor/work coats like those made by Carhartt or Dickies. They tend to be super warm and durable, but a lot cheaper than something you'd get at REI. Again, you're not climbing Everest, so you don't need something ultra breathable, ultralight, and whatever. \n\nA hat, scarf, and mittens are also really important.",

            "comment": "Lifelong NHer here. My go to is a good down jacket (either LL Bean or Patagonia personally). That will get you through 90% of the weather here. A few good fleeces/sweaters/sweatshirts to put under that too. I\u2019d also get some sort of waterproof shell to put over that in case it gets snowy/slushy (spoiler: it will). \n\nA good pair of boots (Bean or otherwise as people have recommended) are useful for sure, but I also find a pair of insulated hiking shoes are more versatile for when you\u2019re inside etc. \n\nit\u2019s all about the layers/versatility! Most of this stuff is available in West Lebanon if you need it here (Hanover  ofc has zero commercial retail)",

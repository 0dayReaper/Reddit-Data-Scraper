Lohse blew himself up, couldn't take accountability for himself, and tried to use the greek system as scapegoat. \n\nThe greek system is a bit of a bubble, and some people take it too seriously from a social status perspective. Having been in one of the \"hard\" hazing frats, it really wasn't that bad at all, and I'm sure it's been nerfed since.",

My house was inclusive and we had members of different races, nationalities, and sexual orientations.  We even had members who didn't drink.  My girlfriend was not in a greek house by choice and was perfectly fine.  Almost all of the house parties are open and she didn't feel left out. \n\nThere are exceptions everywhere and the article did not represent Dartmouth as a whole.  As BigGreen10 said, the author clearly had an angle.  Rolling Stone also had written an article about Duke years back -- it clearly had an angle and did not represent Duke as a whole.",

He took all the worst things he\u2019d ever heard about hazing, put them into a single article and pretended it had all happened to him after a brother called the cops on him for railing lines off a composite in the chapter room. I wouldn\u2019t pay attention to a single word of that nonsense.",

No pressure and lots of other opportunities/communities to be a part of. I was there during the time of that article, too, and the campus sense was unanimously that were a lot of \"creative liberties\" taken with the article, to say the least.",

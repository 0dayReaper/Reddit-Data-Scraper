    "postText": "Hi! I am a high school senior applying to Dartmouth in the next couple weeks. I have a 32 ACT and a 5.3 weight (3.95 unweighted) GPA, and am 4th out of my class of 350 or 450 (public school). I am a white, gay, transgender male. Should I send my ACT score when I apply or no? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Just go ahead and send it! 32 ACT is in the 97th percentile and will complement your GPA nicely to show that you can handle the rigor. I would also write a compelling personal statement / Common App essay about some of your lived experiences. Sounds like you have a strong candidacy. The biggest asset to you will be applying ED over RD because the acceptance rate is much higher. I\u2019m also a white gay male (but cisgender) and have a similar background (very strong public education and class rank and good test scores but not 99th percentile in test scores). I was admitted to Dartmouth RD almost six years ago now. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend RD today lol \u2014 I mainly applied RD because of anxiety about financials but it seems like Dartmouth is doing a better job of giving applicants an estimate of their financial aid package with the calculator on their website.",

I talked mostly about how I want to help communities specifically in central and south America with health care and I found research that I could use to help these areas. I feel like this ties together my volunteer work with key club and my local children's hospital with my biology major. But, I am really not sure if this is what they are looking for.",

A 32 is 25th percentile at Dartmouth.Source: https://www.turito.com/blog/college-guide/dartmouth-admission-requirements \n\nYou have really strong stats, and your implied ACT score from those is probably higher than your actual ACT score. \n\nAlternatively, you could try and take one more ACT for a high composite score, or wait to use your scores for RD once you have had time to take another test. \n\nGenerally for most Ivy\u2019s they are looking for 99th percentile on these standardized tests.",

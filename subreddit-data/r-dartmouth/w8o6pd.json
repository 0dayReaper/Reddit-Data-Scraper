In my experience, the rooms themselves were pretty okay. The single I had was spacious, actually. \n\nThe facilities are the issue - laundry situation was abysmal and bathrooms were gross. Bring a fan because there's no AC. There are much nicer dorms on campus, but these aren't the very worst ones either.\n\nAnd in terms of location: a little far from central campus. Right next to frat row, and at least a 5-10 minute walk to most other things.",

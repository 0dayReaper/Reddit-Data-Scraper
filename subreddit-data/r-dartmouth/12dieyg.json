    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI am accepted to the Ph.D. program at Dartmouth. Based on some basic calculations it looks like Hanover is not the best option for housing. \n\nI was thinking of nearby places like Lebanon, West Lebanon, etc. Can we bike year-long from there to Dartmouth College? The current stipend does not seem to be very supportive of getting a car.\n\nI come from a place where it never snows, I am interested in knowing how things work out in this scenario when it's snowing. Is biking to college feasible? Google Maps shows Lebanon is 4.4 miles away from the college.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

Coming from West Leb the only road is very narrow and has no shoulders at all to bike on, which is scary all year to begin with. The AT is wonderful, but as others have said, it doesn't run on weekends. If you could find a spot in Sachem Village grad housing you could walk in to Hanover.",

            "comment": "I'm on the cycling team (also a Ph.D. student), and no one rides outside in the winter outside of Hanover. You could do it if you're \\*really\\* dedicated and buy all the right equipment, but there are still going to be days when it'd be very uncomfortable. We had -20F a couple of times this winter.\n\nI did buy a car after my first year using money from a summer internship. I won't say it's absolutely necessary, but I couldn't imagine going back. Living in that part of NH/VT can get extremely dreary and having a car actually allows you to explore the area and go hiking/skiing/escape to Burlington and even just buy groceries somewhere that's not the food co-op (which is great, but very expensive).\n\nRegarding housing, it's true that it's a huge pain. During COVID, I moved to a place 30 miles away from campus and now I commute once a week. That's possible because I'm in CS and don't really need to be on campus to do my work.\n\nI used to live on campus and spent half of my stipend on a one-bedroom apartment. If you're willing to do that, it's definitely possible to find a place if you start looking early enough. For example, there are two 363 sqft apartments available right now for about $1000/month: https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/dartmouth-rentals",

You could buy now and sell it after your Ph.D. Other than that, living within walking distance is really the only other option I\u2019d consider. For reference, I am a recent alum and visited on one of the coldest weekends in Feb this year. It was -40 (F and C are the same) with windchill.",

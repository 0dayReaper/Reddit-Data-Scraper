    "postText": "I was recently lucky enough to be accepted into Dartmouth college with full aid. I also have two national scholarships worth about 20k each. I can either use the scholarships for undergrad or grad school. I know that if I use all of them for undergrad Dartmouth will reduce the amount of aid I get from the college scholarship fund, but if I use like 3k from each will the remaining balance of my account be sent to me or go back to the scholarship organization? Thanks for all your help",

General Chemistry\nFor students who wish to major in Chemistry, Biophysical Chemistry or Biological Chemistry,\nit is important to begin taking chemistry courses early, and they are strongly encouraged to take Chemistry 5-6 or Chemistry 11 in their first\nyear. None of the major programs precludes off-campus activities, such as Language Study Abroad. Students who are interested in combin- ing chemistry and engineering should plan their program in consultation with both the undergrad- uate advisor at Thayer and one of the members of the Undergraduate Advising Committee\nof the Chemistry Department at the start of the first year. Students contemplating a major in the physical sciences, but undecided between physics and chemistry, should note that Mathematics\n3 and 8, Chemistry 5-6 or Chemistry 11, and Physics 13-14 will serve as good preparation for further study in either field.\n\n\nSo all it really tells us is General chemistry :(",

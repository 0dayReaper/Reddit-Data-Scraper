    "postText": "How difficult is it to switch engineering majors at Dartmouth - specifically from being admitted for Material Science Engineering to changing to Electrical Engineering. Can I switch before I am enrolled, or will I only be able to switch after the first semester/year.  Thanks for the help!",

            "comment": "All engineering undergrad degrees are generalized. \n\nI have an AB and a BE and both are \"engineering sciences\"\n\nI focused in mechanical, but it doesn't really say that anywhere. You just take certain courses within a pathway. \n\nhttps://engineering.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/ab/majors/engineering-sciences\n\nso for AB I took:\n\nMath 11, Physics 13/14, Chem 5 (carried in AP credit which might not be an option), and CS 5 for my pre reqs\n\nThen\nEngs 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 32, 33, 37, 71, 76\n\nThen for the BE:\nEars33, Astro 25, Engs 80, 89, 90, 142, 51, 93, 146 \n\nSo when you get later on you start concentrating into a certain field. but early on they're all really general. You can switch pretty easily really up until you into the BE curriculum.",

You just get accepted to the college and then declare a major by sophomore spring. All you have to do is take the courses you want to get trained in whatever field you're interested in. The only specialty is biomed to general engineering.  That *is* a bitch, but only because biomed is premed + engineering.",

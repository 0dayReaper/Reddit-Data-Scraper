    "postText": "Hi! I'm currently a senior applying to Dartmouth and I was wondering whether undergraduate students can conduct research at Tuck? Is it realistically possible to get involved with research at Tuck (are professors willing to accommodate undergraduate students as RAs?) Also, are there any opportunities for undergrads at the PE/VC center at Tuck? Thanks! :)",

My work mainly involves writing code in MATLAB to find trends in data that we have on PE funds. I'm not super familiar with opportunities for undergrads at the PE/VC center, but the Magnuson Center for entrepreneurship has connections with some of the Tuck programs!",

            "comment": "Hi,\nI\u2019m a current senior at Dartmouth and also an Econ major. I would say if you did AP Econ you should be in a pretty good spot to easily get through Econ 1. If you had a 5, they will give you the option to place out of Econ 1; I personally advise against it. Econ 1 provides a good introduction to the major and how the Dartmouth Econ department works that you won\u2019t find in subsequent classes.\nThat being said, Econ at Dartmouth is definitely a bit math heavy. It\u2019s STEM designated, so you will do a fair amount of Math in most classes like Econ 20,21,25,29 etc. However, there are some classes with little to no math, eg Econ 22,27 etc. To the end, if a class is not a prerequisite for the major, you can select a track that has less Math if Math is not your greatest gift.\nBut, the hardest part about the Econ department is the grading. It\u2019s the most popular major at the school and the department is arguably the best undergraduate Econ department in the country. The faculty want to maintain this status and thus grading in the department is unnecessarily stringent. The department has a B+ median policy which means you compete with your classmates for a few A/A- spots. This sucks because you need to perform extra well in most classes to get an A. Just Good performance will consistently get you a B+. You need to go out of your way for an A",

I plan on doing a humanities modified major so I think I will definitely go down the less math-y route where I can. I have a quick question- for math prerequisites do they include trig or just algebraic calculus?",

As such, lets say at the semester school you have 4 tests, meaning one every 4 weeks. Some professors here may do 2 exams or maybe still keep 4, meaning that you may have a test almost every other week. It\u2019s why I like to call weeks 2-8 Midterm weeks,. Someone\u2019s probably taking a test in some class during this time xD. \n\nIt\u2019s not awful especially because you take less classes than a semester person per term, but it can be real challenging at the start! Keep in mind this is not descriptive of only Econ, its every department. Just varies how professors run their classes.",

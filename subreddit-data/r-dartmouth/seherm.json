Also, always double up on socks and make sure they aren\u2019t super thin ones. I\u2019ve almost gotten frostbite from being dumb as a child lol. I also used to wear 2 long sleeved shirts and/or 2 hoodies. Get a beanie and flip your hood over it! Final note- turtle necks are your friend if you hate scarfs.",

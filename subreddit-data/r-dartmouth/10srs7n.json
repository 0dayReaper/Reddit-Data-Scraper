    "postText": "I was wondering if I could change my major. I was deferred from Dartmouth last December as a pre-med major. During these months I have changed my intended major and applied as a public policy/pol sci major for all my RDs. I think that public policy is the right fit for me since most of my ecs are focused on community and advocacy kinds of work. Do you think I should email and ask them or will they think I'm indecisive since I made a 180\u00b0 turn?",

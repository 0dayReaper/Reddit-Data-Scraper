    "postText": "I just have a few questions (academics-related) about Dartmouth. I know I shouldn't be worrying about much of this yet, I'm just inquiring.\n\nCan undergrads take grad-level courses (more specifically, the 100+ level classes)?\n\nIf I've taken Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations, what's the highest math I can place into for my first year?\n\nFrom what I see, 35 credits are required to graduate. How many credits are from general requirements (non-major related courses)? \n\nWith these general requirements, how do students fit them into their course of study? Do they knock them out as early as possible, or do they spread them out thin throughout the four years?\n\nThank you all! I appreciate the help. See you in the fall.",

Doing the hardest math class you can the first semester is not recommend unless you really are into that \n\nYou can check the general requirements online, it is not too many classes. \n\nAnd it really just depends on your major and D plan. I think most people will complete most of gen Ed earlier on but might leave a couple for later. Really depends on the person and major though.",

Don\u2019t worry, totally get how you are excited and curious about what is to come and you should be!\nFrom my perspective...\n1. Yes, although it\u2019s rather rare. I know of people who have done it.\n\n2. See [https://www.dartmouth.edu/reg/enrollment/prematriculation_credit.html](https://www.dartmouth.edu/reg/enrollment/prematriculation_credit.html) for Preenrollment credit. You may have to take a placement exam with the math department during orientation.\n\n3. 35 credits to graduate, each class is 1 credit. Nice and simple, with the exception of individual music study classes. To graduate you must complete a major though and all distributive requirements.\n\n4. Most people complete a majority of them in their first few years and will have one or two distribs left by senior year",

            "comment": "Hey!\nIf you\u2019re concerned about Grad Math classes in particular, I know quite a few people who\u2019ve done it, and I\u2019ll be doing a couple this year. \n\nAs for course selection, checkout the applied and pure math flowcharts on this site to see which classes you can take.\n\nhttps://math.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/majors/\n\nWould def not worry about these at this point. Talk to your advisor during course selection and you\u2019ll be just fine. \n\nYour background will let you take number theory, probability, and PDEs in the fall off the top of my head. There\u2019s also some other applied classes you could take. Maybe abstract algebra too if you have exp w proofs. \n\nI had a similar background coming into college and lowkey regret not taking classes like algebra and analysis freshman year. Def take a stab at those and see if you can manage them. Ofc don\u2019t push yourself to failure, but you might have a great time doing those classes and be set up rlly well for other advanced classes/research in math.",

I'm definitely excited to take those classes in the fall.\n\nI know with my background I'm capable of taking those classes in the fall, but I don't see an option ANYWHERE letting me place out of Multivariable Calculus, let alone Linear Algebra and ODE. Just wanted to confirm, will there be a placement exam for me to take for these placements? Is it multiple exams, or is it general? \n\nThank you again! I'm excited to get started.",

Paraphrasing from the article, it\u2019s a restaurant/bar that also hosts some guest entertainers from time to time. \n\nHaven\u2019t been there as I\u2019m new to Dartmouth lol, but from what I hear I think this venue would serve the needs of grad students (and townies) more than undergrads.",

I haven't been for the live music yet but I saw the stage tonight, it looks like a fun space. Good fried chicken, nice atmosphere. I'd highly recommend.",

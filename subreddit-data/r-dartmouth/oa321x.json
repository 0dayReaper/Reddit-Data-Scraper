    "postText": "Hey guys! I recently got out of the Active Army from a 3 1/2 year contract as an infantryman and I'm currently serving in the National Guard. Since I recently got out I'm knocking out a bunch of Gen-eds at my local community college and i'm really passionate about going to Dartmouth. I've scoured the online vet community and cant seem to find anyone that would be willing to give me a tour of the Campus. Anyone have any leads for me?",

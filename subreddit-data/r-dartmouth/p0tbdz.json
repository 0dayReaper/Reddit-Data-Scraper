Something cool that will come in handy to have while he is there.  For example, I was thinking about a great book with local hikes or something of the sort.  Any thoughts?  Thanks in advance!!",

I have the Dartmouth Outing Guide, which you can see here, and have used it a ton.\n\nhttps://outdoors.dartmouth.edu/doc/merchandise.html\n\nThe one downside to it, as a freshman it can be a bit trickier to organize your own that isn't right on campus.",

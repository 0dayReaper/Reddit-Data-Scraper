We are conducting a confidential research project evaluating the effects of Covid-19 on Students\u2019 decisions to take gap year(s) among the United States population. My team and I would like to distribute a survey that we curated to understand these relations. Please fill out this survey if you have taken/are planning to take a gap year, or send it to others who have taken a gap year. https://forms.gle/joZssfbgsNdJu5hj8\n\nThank you so much!",

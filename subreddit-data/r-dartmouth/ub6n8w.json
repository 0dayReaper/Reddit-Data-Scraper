    "postText": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m an accepted student and was wondering what the south asian/indian-american community is like at Dartmouth. I\u2019ve grown up in a pretty white town and have always wanted a sort of \u201cbrown community\u201d around me to just talk about our common culture and experiences. Would I get this at Dartmouth?",

            "comment": "You certainly would -- the South Asian Students' Association at Dartmouth was very active with event-planning and outreach, last I was a part of it. There're a good mix of people, undergraduates, graduate students, from Wisconsin to Massachusetts to India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, etc. themselves. Some had parents who grew up in Europe or Africa. A wide variety of experiences and viewpoints and interests but with some common characteristics, of course. Diwali on campus is a big affair, and there are Hindu, Muslim, etc. services in Rollins Chapel and other places frequently. There's also a surprisingly large South Asian community in the Upper Valley (some professors and some simply living and working in the area) who come to the Hopkins Center for the occasional dance performance. There's one excellent Indian restaurant and one even more excellent Nepalese restaurant in Hanover itself (&lt;15 mins from the Green) and more in the surrounding towns.",

I\u2019d say about 50 were regularly active and 20+ went to every single major event. Hard to say, exactly, as it waxed and waned with who was on campus each term.",

There\u2019s not a big culture around dance teams, acapella groups, and cultural events that you might find at Michigan or Penn for example.\n\nYou\u2019ll definitely meet other south Asian students (and some of them will become your best friends) but I wouldn\u2019t bank on a huge brown community like you might find elsewhere. Not a bad thing - I actually loved the extra push to get out of my comfort zone as someone who came from a pretty brown high school haha\n\nFeel free to DM me if you got any other Qs",

            "comment": "Current first year student here! Tbh, had no idea about the South Asian Students' Association here...could be in part due to lack of advertising around campus. \n\nThe different South Asian student bodies in my perspective operates like a mosaic and is quite separated, \n\nAs for Muslim students, there is one small prayer room with a very small (10 students ish) community. I believe that Hindu Puja services happen daily at 7pm in Rollins Chapel.\n\nThe desi food here is not ideal (definitely miss home cooked meals around here). Not a fan of the options on campus but different cultural+religious clubs sometimes have events where they would cook foods which is a great experience. \n\nThere are South Asian dance groups where I think you are most likely to find other desi students. Apart from that, it is quite hard to find more brown kids.",

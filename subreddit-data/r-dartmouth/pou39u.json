    "postText": "Hi, I'm planning to apply to Dartmouth ED this cycle. \n\nI can apply as full pay, but I would like to (if possible) lessen the burden for my parents. However, I don't know how significantly my chances will be reduced if I apply with need for finaid. Also, I'm East Asian (Japanese, don't have US citizenship, live in Japan), and I have literally **never** seen anyone get into Dartmouth with aid as an international 'East Asian' (I have seen finaid cases for Southeast asians, Europeans, etc). \n\nI am aware that applying with need for aid will decrease my chances somewhat, but I would really appreciate it if I could talk with some current international students who got in with aid. It would also help if you happened to be of East Asian ethnicity or know anyone that fits my descriptions that got in with aid.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks!",

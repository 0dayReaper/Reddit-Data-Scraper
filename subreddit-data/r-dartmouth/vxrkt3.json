Note, I am an employer that brings on 18 or so CS undergrads a year in Lebanon from Dartmouth as interns and hire a few of them so my answers are VERY CS skewed which seems to be pretty competitive. \n\nOne approach could be to find a internship opening on Handshake and then look at that company\u2019s LinkedIN page to see if any of your Dartmouth connections know someone who works at that company then message them directly via LinkedIN (after applying). Talking to an employee on the inside can help get your application noticed. \n\nIf your goal is to get an internship at Amazon, well I wish you luck. Those roles are very competitive. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt to cold call / email companies in industries you\u2019re interested in. You never know. That is good initiative just don\u2019t get discouraged if no one replies. I reply to EVERY inquiry for internships (about 150 applications a year) because I think every person deserves a response but not all employers treat people that way.",

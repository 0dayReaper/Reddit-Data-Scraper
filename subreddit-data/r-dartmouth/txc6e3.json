Wheelock St. We have heard it is somewhat notorious for being a loud area - anyone able to shed some light on if this area is particularly loud in comparison to other off campus housing at Dartmouth?",

            "comment": "I live in the area and pass the apartment in question quite often. It's a higher traffic area, as Wheelock is a main road into Hanover from Vermont. I have noticed some loud parties/music you can hear when driving by that area, but I wouldn't say it's a common experience. Yet, traffic and loud noise can be relative to where you are coming from and what you are used to.",

You can no longer place out of the language requirement and though some AP scores may result placing you in the appropriate class to the score, I don't think it's a hard rule that you HAVE to take what is assigned to you. Think of them like suggestions! You also might wanna check their website for their rules on credits from AP/IB/high school in general.",

            "comment": "Many years ago when I encountered similar theft from the administration, I repatriated other things into my possession. Not anywhere near the same value (mostly food court stuff like that Frank's Red Hot whenever I was out at home) but it made me feel better.\n\nEdit: FYI, I sleep just fine at night. My situation was more complex and one the college was profiting off of while doing their best to leave me destitute. I had professors writing emails and scheduling meetings on my behalf. The administration only began to relent when I signed paperwork stating they couldn't possibly be at fault because they knew how bad it looked. (Also why I'm not being more specific). They threatened my degree if I didn't sign (I graduated with honors, it was not a probation situation) and were generally underhanded in all interactions. More than anything I would have loved OP's post to be a glowing compliment of how the administrative staff has changed to approach their own meal tickets with care and compassion but I'm not surprised it's the opposite.\n\nAlso s/o to those professors (who were dealing with their own issues), they were incredible in their support.",

I talked about how stuff I surrounded myself with and content I consumed made me who i am on the outer layer and then described how i see my deepest layers.\n\nThis essay was a trainwreck to write but at the end it really screamed \"me\" so i am satisfied with it. An advice would be to talk to people who know you but do not completely depend on that. Spend some quality time with this one, alone.",

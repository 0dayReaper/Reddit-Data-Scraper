    "postText": "So Im an aid seeking international who was deferred ED, and today I received this email in the morning:\n\n\"Although the Admissions Committee is still deliberating, the Financial Aid Office is currently reviewing Class of 2026 documents. We want to ensure that when candidates are selected for admission, we will have sufficient information on file to make a financial aid decision.\n\nWe are not able to determine your financial aid eligibility for the 2022-2023 academic year because your application is currently incomplete. If you have recently supplied the requested information, please allow at least one week for this information to be processed. You may check online at any time to see the status of your application.\n\nThe CSS Profile is an application for Dartmouth scholarship and is required...\"\n\nDid any current students get this back in the day? I don't know if I should get my hopes up or if I'm reaching. Also my CSS was sent during ED so I'm not sure about what they want.\n\nUpdate: I got in!! They didn't give me enough aid so I'm struggling with that but atleast I got in.",

            "comment": "what's weird about it?\n\nDartmouth changed their policy regarding aid for international students this year (either started funding or increased funding, I forget, it's easy to find articles via google, pr/news on Dartmouth website, etc.).\n\nthe email is telling you that the financial aid office is working to make that funding happen for admitted financial aid students (while pointing out that the financial aid office has nothing to do with the admissions process/decision - so their request is neither a sign that you are being admitted nor a sign that you are being rejected).\n\nbased on the section you have included, I would expect the section you did not include to be a  request for information they need but you have not provided (since the last sentence before you cut off the message mentions the CSS profile, perhaps they are asking you to submit the CSS profile - have you confirmed that the admissions portal shows CSS profile as received under the Financial Aid tab. if there is no checkmark by it, even if you sent it, it is missing?). if that is the case, get on it. if they get the missing information in time and you are admitted, your financial aid package can be released quickly/immediately upon admission. if receipt of the document is delayed, it wouldn't affect admission, it would only delay release of a financial aid package.\n\ncontact the office directly &amp; get it worked out",

I submitted it then and my checklist says it was received. \n\nAlso since Dartmouth has gone need blind for Internationals as well, that would mean that the financial aid office only gets to work on an applicant after their decision was finalised. I assume they aren't spending their time coming up with an aid package for all applicants since those would be in the thousands so I'm not sure if there's no correlation between the two but I also don't know if I'm reading too much into it.",

                            "comment": "Need Blind does NOT mean financial aid office only works on your financial aid package AFTER admission - the process is not \"serial\"\n\nNeed Blind means Admissions office/decision/process and Financial Aid office/decision/process are separate  - the process is parallel.\n\nthe first steps in the financial aid process are clerical - confirmation of receipt of  required documents and communicating need for additional documents to families.  that is not as resource/time/skill intensive as reading admissions applications.\n\nI'm not going to assert financial aid processes 100% of applications received - I have no documentation of that and the aid office could maintain a parallel process without reviewing 100% - Financial Aid could probably reduce the number they process by half if admissions just shared a list of applications that didn't justify review/discussion beyond initial read.\n\nHowever, there is also zero evidence that financial aid process cant/doesn't start until a student's admission is certain - every source I've found says otherwise.\n\nRegardless - if I received that email and the missing portion of that email suggested my file was missing information, I would contact the sender directly immediately and not stop trying to reach them until someone told me directly that they had everything they needed or otherwise need something - Trust but verify - the checkmark could be wrong",

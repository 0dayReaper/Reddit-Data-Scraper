Any online course / textbooks closely related to Dartmouth CS10 materials would be appreciated!\nI have solid background in Math and took 4 years of Physics in high school so hope it wouldn\u2019t be too bad",

I\u2019d do what @Red_Army suggested. You could also email the professor and ask for their recommendations. Also, technically everybody who is taking CS10 after CS1 hasn\u2019t learned Java.",

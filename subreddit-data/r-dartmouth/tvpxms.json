    "postText": "Hey guys I\u2019m deciding between Dartmouth and Emory. Emory is going to be significantly cheaper like 45k  a year cheaper. Im pre-med. Emory is a pretty prestigious school and it has a stellar reputation for pre-med and I like Atlanta. The thing is I can\u2019t let go of Dartmouth being an Ivy other than that it\u2019s my dream college. I have always wanted that Dartmouth college setting. It seems like such a great college experience. Also the med school placement is amazing. I\u2019m not sure what I should do. As for grades in pre-med I feel like Emory might be easier but I\u2019m not sure. Can someone help me decide. My intended major is Neuroscience at Dartmouth and Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology at Emory",

Dartmouth has the ability to give great aid, so follow Dr. Stranges advice and follow up with the school. If that works out, then go with your dream school. If not, you should know that Emory is a great school with an amazing neuroscience department. Depending on exactly what type of research or subset of neuroscience, it might even be better than Dartmouth. Don\u2019t get me wrong with all things being equal, I\u2019ll always choose Dartmouth for undergrad again, but Emory\u2019s program is excellent and can set up nicely for med school or other careers.",

Either school is great\u2014do you love a quaint NE outdoor lifestyle community or a southern big city culture?

I will say that if you\u2019re not super set on the pre med track Dartmouth could be better to  discover your interests but it\u2019s also way more expensive. Also, Dartmouth gives good aid so I\u2019m confused as to why Emory is significantly cheaper.",

Dartmouth will give you a leg up in grad school apps over Emory or in the job market in a very significant way. \n\nAlso, grade inflation is real. Having attended a big public undergrad and then two ivies for grad school and teaching undergrad courses while in grad school, I can tell you that science courses are hard everywhere, but you will do much better at Dartmouth. \n\nHave you applied for financial aid?",

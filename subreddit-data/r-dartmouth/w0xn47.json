That adjustment time is different for everyone though, it took me a term and I kinda ate it freshman fall because I was overwhelmed. It's up to you how hard you want to go in your first term. If you want to take a risk, you could front-load stuff like CHEM 5 and MATH 8. If you want to play it safer, you might think about spacing out the prereqs more, but you'll end up with a heavier schedule in later years because BME has so many requirements",

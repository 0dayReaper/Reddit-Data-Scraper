I was wondering if there\u2019s a dolly that I could use to transport my packages to my dorm? Or do I have to carry it all by hands? Thank you in advance!",

None at Hinman or in the Hop, so you\u2019ll need to grab one from a dorm and take it to Hinman with you when you go pick up your packages.",

            "comment": "If you want to pursue a hobby, there are a lot cheaper ways to get started besides an Ivy League school w/ $60,000+/year tuition! Not so sure about game design, but there are 3D design &amp; animation classes.\n\nDartmouth was by far the most \u201cprestigious\u201d school I got into, so for me it was a no-brainer. Certainly, there are many other schools that are less \u201cprestigious\u201d but offer a competitive, if not better, computer science education; however, it was more important to me to have a well-rounded education with name-brand value, strong alumni support, and future connections.\n\nAfter spending a couple years in post-grad, I\u2019m very happy with my pre-grad decision process. I work in Silicon Valley, and people here come from all types of schools. Those at tech-centric schools like CalPoly, Georgia Tech, MIT, etc. had to take lots of classes for their B.S. that I didn\u2019t have to take to get my B.A. Many of these classes were difficult and didn\u2019t end up paying off in the end by giving relevant experience for the job market. Getting the B.A. at Dartmouth, I was able to take more classes that I was passionate about on the side in addition to the core CS curriculum, which is certainly sufficient to land a job in the current market.",

            "comment": "I'm a grad student going to Dartmouth next year for CS. I went to an undergrad school that didn't offer any CS, and I'm really interested in game design/programming, so getting a grad degree in CS is something that is worth my while regardless. I applied to a ton of schools, and while some of the big California schools (Berkeley, Stanford, USC) might be better for game industry connections due to their location (and not to mention some of the best cs programs in the country), Dartmouth is much closer to my family, and is a 2 year program while some others are only 1 (I'll need the extra time since I have a small cs background).\n\nDartmouth also has the digital arts program, and its website includes some references to game design, and lists some places that students have done internships at. I'd check it out here: [http://digitalarts.cs.dartmouth.edu/](http://digitalarts.cs.dartmouth.edu/)\n\nI'm not sure what specific game design courses there are, but I'd bet there are a fair number of students interested in games.",

So, I'd like to hear from the Dartmouth engineers about my prospect in robotics if I were to be accepted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I've also heard that Dartmouth is hiring new stem faculty and that new engineering building is going to be complete before the freshman year starts, will such development change things?\n\nThanks",

I can\u2019t say I know too much about Thayer, but the CS department is scheduled to move right next to it in December.",

It's one of the more fleshed-out tracks in Thayer and there's a [whole course sequence for it] (https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/graduate/meng/mechanical). A few of my classmates now work in mechantonics and have jobs at a variety of companies, from startups to major powerhouses (e.g. Tesla) to research institutions. If you're intelligent about your extracurriculars (highly recommend DFR to build up your production skills) and your internships (use your off-terms to chase mechatronics opportunities), you'll be good to go",

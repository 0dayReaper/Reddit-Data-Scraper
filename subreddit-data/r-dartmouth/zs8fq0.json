Please let me know honestly, thank you for any input.",

Everyone's super nice and chill :) You can totally fit in w/o doing anything you are uncomfortable with! You can find your people through different clubs, sports, activities, etc.",

I'm unaffiliated and my primary social space is with my Christian fellowship and dance troupe. I don't feel like I\"m missing out on anything, so be encouraged. There are a lot of other options like joining the outing club, or acapella/dance groups too!",

Past events include painting (and wine if you were of age), back massages, roller blading, succulent planting, trivia night, crafting, and more. All with plenty of food. There's so many social activities to do from the outdoor hiking and kayaking to club events and performances, that you will 100% have too many things you want to do and not enough time.",

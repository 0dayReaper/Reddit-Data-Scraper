I can access the form but not see responses to it.\n\nThe first two statements directly contradict what was said in the email, and I'm asking why you think they're lying. They could be -- they definitely haven't been handling things great overall. I'm just trying to find evidence that they're lying. \n\nFor the third point, that is not the implication. The implication is that people [who are not in the category of students in question] are acting on false information, which could be true, and doesn't reflect badly on the international students at all.",

    "postText": "title!!! I\u2019m a rising senior in high school who is super interested in Dartmouth. I applied for the program and pretty much wrote my response to the one prompt in the app in 1 day lol (I work really well under pressure LMAO) and am hoping for the best. If you went, what was your experience in Dartmouth bound? And if you didn\u2019t, what was your experience stepping foot on campus for the first time? Was it easy for you to adjust to Dartmouth? Thanks everyone :)",

I also did it the last day because I like to work under pressure :) I actually love people who do everything their last day just because it turns out to be super authentic. I wish you good luck, and if you want you can DM me, we can share more experience, I can give you more information that I received from previous bounders.",

The people I met changed my life completely and opened my eyes to the possibility of the Ivy League. The campus was stunning and the air was extremely crisp. People on campus were really approachable, funny, down to earth, and kind. It was easy to adjust and I could see myself there. \n\nI didn\u2019t love the party culture (60% are in Greek life) and lots of people talked abt pretty crazy drug usage. I also felt like it might be a bit too outdoorsy for my taste. Aside from that I could have seen myself thriving there. Hope this helps :))",

That being said, I'm going mostly for the outdoors aspects of the culture too, and most of the other 27's I've met are more similar to me.",

Ik for undergrads like frat party\u2019s are a big thing but it\u2019s kinda weird for grad students to go to so is there like something else? Sorry for all the questions. Thanks haha",

If you want to make friends outside of your lab, you'll have to get pretty creative. Club sports are generally open to grad students and that can be fun (I'm on the cycling team and that's been great). Most of my other social connections have come through non-Dartmouth activities and that seems to be true for my lab mates, too.\n\nOverall, you can make it work but don't expect the kind of social life that you'd have in a city.",

You could also sign up for all kinds of outdoor PE classes such as skiing or sailing. You can also join the local hockey league for a few games on the pond that freezes over during winter.\n\nOh, and you need to do classes and research, duh!",

I do hear there are designated grad school social events, local watering holes, and traveling opportunities. Also Hanover is a beautiful place and I imagine there\u2019s bountiful opportunity to connect with people outside of Bars and frat parties",

Starting salaries in consulting seem to be about $100k at the moment for Dartmouth grads and starting salaries in finance seem to range from $125-175k. Grads doing nonprofit work or research at universities probably start at $50-60k if I had to guess. Don\u2019t know anything about engineering, biotech, or CS, but salaries and career growth are, for sure, very promising.",

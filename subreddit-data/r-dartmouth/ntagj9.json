    "postText": "A friend is visiting Vermont near Union Village Dam, and y'all are apparently having a heatwave, and I said, oh, you should go where I used to go. Unfortunately, it's been 44 years (god help me) and I have only the vaguest sense of where to go. Like drive across the dam, hang a left, and look for the parked cars, I guess? But I think there's a way to approach it from the west side of the river, too? Can anybody give me more precise directions to pass on?",

Hope you all get to cool off somewhere:\n\nThetford Center and Union Village Spots\r  \nWe almost didn\u2019t want to draw attention to these two spots because in many ways they are the quintessential swimming holes, the kind of places a Hollywood location scout would pick if a swimming hole were needed for a scene in a movie. The first is called Sandy Beach (there\u2019s a sign, so you can\u2019t miss it), and it\u2019s a half-mile down Buzzell Bridge Road from Route 113. Turn right into the parking lot, only a few steps from a basketball half-court-size sandy beach and Olympic-size swimming hole big enough to do laps.\r  \n\r  \nThe water is so calm that it could be mistaken for a pond. If you want something more daring, drive another 0.6 of a mile down Buzzell toward Union Village to the Chutes.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s a favorite among skinny dippers \u2014 indeed, a sign is posted that commands \u201cNude Bathing Prohibited.\u201d Follow the trail down to the river, where the rushing water wends around and over several rock croppings before spilling over a short fall. The spot is down a ravine and encircled by evergreens, providing a degree of privacy and perhaps explaining why the Chutes has been favored by those who prefer to go au naturel.\r  \nhttps://www.vnews.com/Summer-Guide-Upper-Valley-Swimming-Holes-2637291",

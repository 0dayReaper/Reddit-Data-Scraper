Are there certain formatting criteria I have to abide by (font size, spacing, word/page limit, etc)? I couldn\u2019t find it in Dartmouth\u2019s website (or am I missing something?).\n\nAdditionally, are there any tips on writing a peer rec? (Don\u2019t wanna let my peer down by writing a low-quality one :\u2019D)",

Use it is an opportunity to tell the admission committee some things about the applicant that otherwise can't be listed on the application by the applicant himself! And there's no word limit and formatting!",

            "comment": "I honestly love that Dartmouth does this. I think this is your chance to give the admissions committee an idea of how your peer/friend conducts themselves both in and out of academia from a different perspective. They have heard what their teachers and mentors have to say about them, now they want to hear what their peers say about them. What makes your peer special? Are they supportive of other students? Are they a team player? What qualities about them do you admire? Give solid examples. I wrote something similar for a friend's application to medical school. It was a supplement. DM me if you want a copy of that to give you ideas. It's very similar to what Dartmouth is asking for.",

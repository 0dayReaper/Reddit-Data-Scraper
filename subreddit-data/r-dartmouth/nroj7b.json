    "postText": "Hi everyone - future '25 here! I just wanted to ask about what's the social scene like at LLC's and if someone could tell me some things about the GIS LLC and the French LLC (I took IB HL French, but I plan on starting back at the basic level 1 French at Dartmouth since college french esp here is much more rigorous). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Can you join this (or other) LLC's later on? \n2. Would you recommend LLCs to a freshman? I've heard that bonds are not as in regular dorms. \n3. If I didn't partake in an LLC would my college experience be much difficult without it (in terms of buildings connections, internship opportunities, etc). For background, I am an Econ major, and I don't plan on participating in greek life. \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Hmm. I would take the placement test for French. If you can test out of a language class, I think you should (I think I should have for Japanese). 35 credits is not a lot and you might find electives/other disciplines/study abroads you want to explore and need some leeway for.\n\n1. You can join LLCs any time you're coming back from an off term, so if you're on for 3 terms straight freshmen year and you don't live in an LLC, I'm pretty sure the next chance you'll have is when you apply for housing for your next on-term (and however many successive terms you are on from that term \u2013 i.e. sophomore fall + winter).\n\n2. Depends on the LLC. I loved my LLC freshmen year and I would apply to it again in a heartbeat. My LLC was mostly upperclassmen, and the only other freshmen on my floor was my roommate (and we didn't vibe at all). I still had plenty of freshmen friends/acquaintances, they were just from classes/clubs I was heavily involved in. There are also freshmen only LLCs.\n\n3. No. You'll make friends through classes/clubs/work/research/whatever as long as you do stuff you actually want to do. As for greek life, you'll probably have to it out for yourself (I'm unaffiliated), but something like 80% of non-freshmen (which is all that really matters for the count because freshmen can't rush) are affiliated. So make of that what you will, but the 60 something % that Dartmouth advertises is misleading.",

            "comment": "GIS LLC is only for freshman, so social bonds are probably more similar to other experiences. I did the residential GIS LLC and loved it. The events were really interesting and it was great living with other freshman with similar interests in global issues.\n\nRe greek life, you have a year to decide about rushing. Most decide to become affiliated, and most probably like you were not set on going greek. Keep an open mind and decide for yourself. There is a huge diversity of greek houses. I myself am unaffiliated, but many D alums I know are like me and were affiliated so I thought it likely I would want to go that route. But then I became deeply involved with the DOC subclubs. That is a tight community too and consumes all my social time.",

    "postText": "Now i know many of y'all say KEKL OMEGALUL ARAM player and all that, but i only play ARAM. I am a level 600 plus player playing since years.\n\nLast night, I queued up at midnight and stayed up playing till 4.30 am or so...Why stay up so late you might ask? Coz I played 9 games out of which 8 were L and last one was a W. I have this tendency to get at least one win I'm sure many can relate. I have started to play recently on EUW as there is better ping but I have a soft spot for my 10 year NA account. So I make sure to keep it active.\n\nAll I wanted is a fair game. The 9 games I sacrificed my sleep for made me more depressed than satisfied in the end. Even the last one that I finally won, wasn't satisfactory at all. Now I'll come to the point.\n\nI have noticed a drastic increase in 'give up' or troll attitude. This feels mainly on my NA account. Maybe because I'm a higher level/mmr that riot gives me a weak team and expects me to hard carry. I love a challenge always. I have mastery 5 plus on most of my champs...but honestly, it was fucking impossible to win almost all 8 games that I lost. I will show you my KDA and a summary of what happened in each game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLOSS\n\nGame 1 : Zoe 9/10/22\n\n3 of my teammates went 15 or 20 plus deaths, enemy team got tanky and outscaled us\n\nGame 2 : Caitlyn 7/6/13\n\n3 teammates fed 10 plus deaths. Same as above.\n\nGame 3 : Master Yi 21/13/9\n\nOur only tank player Sett fed and just couldnt stay with us. Tank gapped.\n\nGame 4 : Talon 10/15/29\n\nour only tank Hecarim decided he will build AP lethality hybrid and fed 20 deaths. Replied 'bro its aram why u taking so seriously'. I fed a lot in the end hence so many deaths.\n\nGame 5 : K'Sante 4/11/17\n\nI tried to frontline the fuck for my team hence 11 deaths. Our actual tanks Mundo and Skarner fed 15 and 20 deaths while having no idea about positioning.\n\nGame 6 : Sion 8/9/16\n\n3 of my teammates again fed almost 15 deaths each. Had no idea how to counter enemy Vlad who danced all around them.\n\nGame 7 : Twisted Fate 1/7/17\n\nThis was my IDGAF game. I just wanted to play a champ that I like. Tilt had reached me and I was sleep deprived at this point. Our Vex decided mid game, she just doesn't want to play.\n\nGame 8 : Karma 7/9/18\n\nDecided to play burst magic pen to attempt to create maximum impact. Everyone fed around 12 deaths. Our trundle only ulted Corki the whole game who would just W and fly away everytime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIN\n\nGame 9 : Lissandra 15/9/32\n\nFinally! I'm fucking happy right? Nope. coz our team had 75 kills opposed to our enemy team who only had 33 kills. They were so fucking free. I would've won that game playing with my legs. All of them almost gave up from the start and fed around 15-20 deaths. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, it felt like all the previous games I had 3 or more weak players, and in the final one that I won, the enemy team had 3 or more...the win after 8 losses didn't feel like an accomplishment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSame patterns I'm observing these days in all my games -\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Most people dont know how to play a tank\n\n\\&gt;Damage champs just go in mindlessly, getting kills but feed equally\n\n\\&gt;People trolling/not taking game seriously/skill issue\n\n\\&gt;AFK/giving up way too early\n\n\\&gt;Boring long drawn sureshot losses\n\n\\&gt;Not joining the team soon at the beginning, resulting in a bad start.\n\n\\&gt;More chatting less playing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow with thousands of games under my belt, I have gone beyond tilting. I usually only use emotes/pings but yes I do occasionly type one or two lines flaming my teammates. Nothing too toxic though, I stay within the riot guidelines of chat. I usually just report them and queue up again, have a smoke,chill. I even get report feedbacks often, suggesting that riot values my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy honest feeling at the end was...I didint deserve so many losses. I understand that I'm not able to hard carry all my games, many times I do as well. But in many cases, no matter how hard you try, just the scaling or comp gap. The game is designed in a way, that one player popping off isn't enough. This is especially true in ARAM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy final thoughts,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love my ARAM, I play it everyday. These days though, I'm experiencing a sense of hopelessness, especially on NA server. I have felt a more serious competitiveness on EUW (I know, LOLZ competitiveness in ARAM, do you even rift bro? Yea, yea...but it is what i feel) \n\nI wish Riot focusses on better matchmaking and queue up players who are equally committed when they get into a game. If it's \"just ARAM\" then at least match equally focused players together. I feel that Riot deliberately matches good players with shit teammates so that people will rage queue again and again. Only to get that one sweet win of the day. Many of us only play 2-3 games occasionally and even these games we get troll/afk/skill issue. IT ISN'T FUN at all. It's highly toxic. Resulting in people playing more and more (profit for the company) but they play like a bunch of zombies...I just want a good player base to play against. I wouldn't mind queuing up with same good players again and again rather than getting Korean challenger players in one and then wood division in the next one! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this only in NA? Or all over? Or am I whining too much about a small issue? Let me know your thoughts.  Thank you. Peace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR : Summary of my 9 games of ARAM that I played last night. Too much trolling/afk/skill issue/not taking game seriously in ARAM on NA server. I am not enjoying the overall experience. Riot needs to make their matchmaking better.",

Your relationship with league is highly toxic, and you should be looking inward. \n\nGames aren\u2019t all about winning. Games won\u2019t always be fair. You can\u2019t expect everyone to take everything as seriously as you do. If you can\u2019t have fun in a game mode like an ARAM because you\u2019re losing, you need to stop playing. Continuing to play while you\u2019re not having fun is not only completely counter productive, but it\u2019s simply unhealthy, especially if it makes you stay up way later than you should. \n\nOn a broader note, if you cant enjoy a game at all while you\u2019re losing, maybe this game isn\u2019t for you. Frustration is one thing, but if you\u2019re rage queuing, you have an unhealthy addiction, and I suggest you take a long break from the game.",

You should have noticed that due to the rng of the system that only in 1 to maybe 2 games out every 10 games is a quality game where everyone is clean and know their champs and comps. The rest is just inting/venting from ranked or just people trying troll builds or first timing champs. You learn to deal with it because you cant change people. It's the toll of having a quick chill mode.",

Just do your minimal flame like a normal league player and instead of re-queueing do something else. Even if you'd win 100% of your games, it wouldn't amount to anything so don't sacrifice your sleep for it.",

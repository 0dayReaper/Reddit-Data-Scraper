It's fucking funny. Even the issue itself, at its core, is just really a complaint that someone else is better than you. It's a problem that isn't even a problem in the first place. It goes away naturally as you get better at the game. It's a sensitive issue and all, but there is a clear solution. Just get better at the game.",

You should WANT to play against higher ELO players. You should WANT the opportunity to beat them, to prove that you can compete with them, you should WANT the opportunity to learn from this experience. You should be want to wear it like a badge of honor that you beat someone who is considered much better than you.\n\nI wish my games were filled with Smurfs or high ELO players because I would much rather play with/against them, take the opportunity to learn, rather than deal with toxic racist griefers who provide you nothing.\n\nThe experience of going against better players and what you do with that experience is a lot more fucking valuable than losing 20-30 LP.\n\nThis is a game about competition what kind of apes run away from competition? Facing against a smurf is not much different than facing someone who is gigafed.\n\nhttps://media.discordapp.net/attachments/205962381589741568/1118059061133451394/13-11_NA1-4682007493_01.webm\n\nThis Lee Sin getting 20+ kills on my team and styling all over us?

If I\u2019m even gold and playing against Diamonds or Masters that\u2019s a significant jump that the vast majority of the time is an automatic L and loss of LP.\n\nIf you want to smurf, go play normals. You\u2019ve every right to play with friends there or whatever reason you\u2019ve decided to play down, but it doesn\u2019t belong in a competitive environment.",

Every single player in one game has been as strong how that Diamond/Masters player is likely going to be strong in your game. \n\nIt is very common game after game you will find someone on the enemy team that is superfed. Well guess what, they still lose, and if the game isn't always lost when you face off a gigafed enemy, the game isn't automatically lost when you face off against a higher ELO player. \n\nBecause the biggest difference between someone who is higher ELO and someone in silver-platinum is the number of mistakes made. Sure mechanics play a part, but many silvers-plats know their champion very well. When you lane against someone higher ELO than you, you lose not because they steamrolled you, it's because you made more mistakes than they did and they capitalized on your mistakes, or you picked the wrong fight, made the wrong macro, controlled the wave incorrectly. This can happen with any opponent who has a strong understanding of their champion regardless of how high their ELO is. I've seen gold players \"stomp\" me as hard as diamond players do, and in both scenarios I can always see where I made a bad decision, it's not because they're just styling all over me.",

If someone is CLEARLY better than the others in the game there's a matchmaking issue. Ranked isn't meant to be just a learning tool. It's meant to be a measure of skill. Your rank defines that.

It's meant to be a means to measure how good you are at that game. Learning is required to get better but it's not the function of ranked. You can get better playing normals. Heck, you can improve mechanics and such playing bots or even aram.\n\nNot wanting to get absolutely stomped in ranked by someone that's beyond multiple ranks better than you is not a lack of competitiveness. Why you believe that is nothing more than an elitist attitude and is just further part of the problem. There's a level of competitive integrity that's expected when you get into a ranked system and smurfs destroy that.",

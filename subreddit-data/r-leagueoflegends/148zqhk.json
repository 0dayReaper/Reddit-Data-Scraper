He only wins if you get hit by every cast or his support bodies you instead.",

[https://lolalytics.com/lol/veigar/build/](https://lolalytics.com/lol/veigar/build/) his E cooldown is 20 seconds level one bro, he also deals no damage early how are you getting oneshot exactly? Your descrpetion fits a late game veigar 40 minute after he scalled, at that point yes he will oneshot you and have low CD on E but thats because you let a late game champion scale.",

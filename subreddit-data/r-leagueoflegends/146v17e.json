It would be amazing if Riot just added videos explaining concepts like wave management, roaming, or teamfighting into the client tutorial.\n\nThere are over 160 champs, and trying to learn how to play the game while also learning what champ does what is really time consuming and difficult.\n\nDon\u2019t even get started on how to build or what runes to take.",

New players can follow the recommendations until they feel like they've learned enough to make those decisions on their own.\n\nI do want to see more tutorial missions that we currently have, though; the current ones are just \"destroy enemy base\", \"turn experience into levels\", and \"turn gold into items\". I'd like to see another mission going over jungling/neutral objectives, one explaining warding/vision/stealth, etc.\n\nI think new players should be encouraged to go out and play for real once they complete these basic tutorials, but I wouldn't be opposed to having advanced tutorials that they can come back to if they're interested in learning about the more meta/high-level stuff.",

They don\u2019t want a new player to get bogged down with the small details while trying to figure out the bigger picture, which is why they have recommended runes and items that work pretty well most of the time.\n\nThe best way to keep new players invested into the game is to keep it simple and let them have fun, not spending 10 minutes trying to figure out whether to take Legends: Alacrity or Legends: Bloodline on Ashe.",

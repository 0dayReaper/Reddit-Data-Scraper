    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI been thinking what if Riot added a system where you gain points (perhaps a new points system) after everygame depending on grade (D- to S+) or maybe depending on KDA? And after gathering points you can buy or unlock skins.\n\nThey can create a reward system like this, which can really make the game more fun and motivate people to play better, not afk, not int, and also give objectif to playing (other than LPs and rank :D )\n\nTo avoid ruining the value of RPs, mythic essence ..etc Riot can set in place some rotation skins to win (you choose only ONE) if u get X points for each patch for example. \n\nWhat do you all think abt this?",

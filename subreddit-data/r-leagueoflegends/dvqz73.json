    "postText": "She has upranked to Silver IV in Solo/Duo, pretty impressive, given how little time she has to play. I think it is good to see a popular politician such as herself sharing this with 4.1million followers, should definitely bring some attention to League of Legends. Apparently she was [Bronze V last year](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1051291913272389633?lang=en), which means she's climbing the ladder faster than many of us. \n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/CGnfl3F\n\nEdit: It seems G2 owner [Ocelote has tweeted](https://twitter.com/CarlosR/status/1194638235806269440) my screenshot to AOC",

We made jokes in the past about how much the new generations were going to regret what they posted to Facebook.. but I think the day of horror is yet to come.\n\nAnother ~10years and we'll have pattern recognition *(dumb AI, aka ML)* hooked into enough things and shared data that there will be no such thing as anonymity on the internet.

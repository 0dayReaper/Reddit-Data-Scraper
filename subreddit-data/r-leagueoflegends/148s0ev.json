Most of my teammates in ARAM will sell their first born if it means they can steal the final kill and deny the penta.\n\nWas going for a penta with Kayle just the other day, was one auto from having it and mid swing my cousin pops his rammus ULT and steals it.  \"Dude, why?\". \"My bad man, you told me to ULT 10 seconds ago when we were chasing, and I forgot to so I wanted to use it.  But hey, you got 4 of em, so it's all good.\"",

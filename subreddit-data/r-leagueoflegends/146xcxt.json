Nothing has changed for so long. Aphelios and Jinx ran rampant in 2022, and we saw nothing else. But once again in 2023, we see Zeri and Aphelios being played, and nothing is being done to address it.\n\nRule number 2 of this sub is \"All claims require evidence\", so here it is.\n\nI collected the data for games played in 2022 and 2023, and present it too you here. We can see the absolute mess that was Jinx Aphelios trades in 2022, combining for 2796 games across major leagues. Zeri is also up there, with 930 games for the year. These 3 combined for over 3700 games in the year.\n\nNow, you might think that seeing this domination of pro play numbers would make someone at a smaller indie company say:\n\n\"Hmm, maybe viewers (and players) might not want to see these champs once again, maybe we should nerf them and get some new champs back in the mix for next year\".\n\nWell, not quite...\n\nSo on the back of that, once again in 2023, we see our favorite champion toping the list with Zeri being played for 746 games at half way through the year. Mr 200 years coming in second place, with a casual 504 games. The same champion that was played for 1500 games last year, still managing 1 YEAR LATER to be played the second most for the season.\n\nLastly, we can see the graph of combined totals at the bottom, showing just how rampant these champions have been over the meta that's lasted over such a long span.\n\nJust for a little reference, vayne has been played 24 times in one and a half years; these lot combined for a total of **5236** games in the same period.\n\nAs just a conclusion here, I think something needs to be done about prolonged metas in pro play. As a viewer, it does make it very hard to enjoy, when I feel like every game is just a replay of the last (We have seen 1500+ games of zeri in 1 and a half years) . This may just be the LCK drafting but my god am I getting bored. This isn't just adcs as well, ahri wukong vi, nami, lulu, maokai all just non stop being picked in this period. I really hope things can change... Please... :(((\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings to note:\n\nOne thing I wanted to add here, is that these graphs do not account for ban rates either. Where often at the start of this year, we have seen zeri almost perma banned everywhere. Unfortunately, when running a query in leagueapedia, they don't hold ban statistics, and I refuse to go into every league for  both years and collect this data, but one would assume these to be very high.\n\nJust a quick edit: Saying they have been played for 5236 games doesn't mean they aren't in the same game. But saying 2000 games of aphelios, 1700 of zeri, 1600 of jinx doesnt flow so well. But you know what I mean.",

    "postText": "Hello, I have a question. Yesterday, my friends told me I appeared online in LoL client, even though I was offline and my PC was turned off. Could it be a bug or should I be worried that someone might have broken into my account. I have two-step authenticator, so it should be pretty safe, right? \n\nThanks for answers.",

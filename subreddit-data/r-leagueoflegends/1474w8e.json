That 70 damage could be gained by going any other item like galeforce or stormrazor which also adds other utility like a dash or movespeed. \n\nMpen boots I haven't done all the math on but having 18 mpen on a 40mr target (most ranged champs but relatively low for the average champion) grants nami E a whopping 30 damage total. obviously there's also mandate and lucian passive to consider but if you bought an extra pickaxe with that money you'd do the same or more damage and save on money for item completion on top.",

You're getting 2 more lethality and the shield break which isn't as useful as you'd think because lulu will not max out E after 2-3 points, zeri is not going shieldbow until maybe 4th-5th AND you make every other item afterwards scale 10x less because you're forgoing crit. Not to mention delaying all your utility items like galeforce RFC potentially stormrazor LDR by 1.5k gold. Its a huge investment for little gain.",

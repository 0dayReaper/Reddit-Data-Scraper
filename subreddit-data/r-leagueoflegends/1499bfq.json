    "postText": "Hi all.\nI quit the game around late 2019 due to focusing on other stuff in life. I just re-downloaded the game and have a question about something I cant tell if I am just going insane or its a setting or how it is now. \n\nWas there a big performance patch or change made within the last few years that made the game feel a lot more clunky or not as smooth to anyone? I am not sure if this is a common topic or beating a dead horse its just driving me crazy. I have less than 20ms playing, no lag, but the game just feels not as fluid or smooth as it used to. \n\nI don't use any skins and I've tried a few different champs now on ARAM and it feels the same. I cant tell if its because I've been gone so long or if something really is different now. \n\nAny clue to what this could be? Just curious and thank you :)",

While not playing, your idea of league\u2019s gameplay might have become idealised and wrong, just like your childhood game dosen\u2019t look this bad in your mind ! (I started playing around 2019 and haven\u2019t stopped playing since, never noticed any difference)",

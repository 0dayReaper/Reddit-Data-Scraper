    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nAs said above, i currently am watching Arcane and am absoloutly loving the show and the content created on Social Media for it. \n\nI also own a very good Setup for 2 Years now and whilst i played through most online games, i never got around to play LOL. \n\nI would be very interested to do so, but the first thing everyone told me was: \"Play this game if you want to ruin your life.\" and \"Don't play LOL just because you saw Arcane.\" \n\nNow, i did try another title with the same reputation which was Dead by Daylight for 3 Years and do think i get what people mean when they explain the reasons not to play LOL. \n\nYet the last time i asked someone was a Decade ago (\"2019\") and im curious. \n\nHas this maybe changed over the years? Or is it just like before a gigantic Red Flag that i should avoid under any costs?",

The only use it has for most of the player base is joking around with other players or far more likely flaming each other. I've been doing this for years now and I'll never go back.",

I\u2019m Diamond 1 and half the time it\u2019s just as much of a shitfest as gold or plat games. The only difference is when plays are made people know what objectives to get, waves are always pushed for prio, players know when they can end, etc. Other than that it\u2019s just as much of a free for all with more advanced mechanical play.",

I've never tanked at the bottom of a league, I was stuck at silver 1, which is the top of a league.\n\n* My higher win rate accumulated no average skill level increase according to op.gg and I lose more lp accordingly.\n\nI question this stuff. I was at around same lp gain/loss when in silver 1, started having 70-80% win rate for enough games to matter and yet I only managed to have worse lp gain/loss. There was nothing to be fixed there.",

(Yuumi, Zeri on e-sports, the biggest budget of all time, the community, etc) \n\nI genuinely think that I can't recommend playing this game anymore, its too volatile, one can't even learn to play it before a minute 6 Vi flashes out of a bush and kills you with only half an item. The ChatBan bot is set on the highest priority and will kill you if you write something flagged, and the roles of the game has been smudged together so much that you see ADC's on mid/jg and duo tanks on bot.\n\nAnd all of that on top of all the knowledge you need to become mid at the game. If I were a new player, I would have uninstalled this shit in less than week, this coming from someone who got told to off himself while learning and playing in *bots 8 years ago*.",

The game is much more complex than it seems at first, it has so many layers to learn, but it is also what makes it so interesting.\n\nThe second problem could be the other players toxicity. If you are used to play other online game, LoL is not a lot more toxic. You can expect to have one toxic player every 2 games (but you easily can mute the chat), but there are some game modes more chill than others.",

Vi and Ekko are really big examples of this; their entire characters in League revolve around things that have not even been touched on in Arcane.\n\nOf course, the show was made after the game, so many people were going into it knowing these things, and in a way that's cool too.  Just keep it in mind if you plan to play League, Legends of Runeterra, or if you want to read more lore on the Universe site.  ALSO keep in mind that Arcane is not a 1:1 adaptation of the world of the game; there are some pretty significant differences.",

The story is meant for you to already know the consequences of their actions.\n\nEdit: SPOILERS AHEAD WARNING WARNING\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example. Viktor is grieving his potential love interest. Him telling Jayce to destroy the hexcore because he thinks it\u2019s too dangerous is entirely different when you know that Viktor ends up as a machine because of the hexcore.\n\nNot knowing that Viktor will continue to use the hexcore makes him look immature and is deciding to blame the hexcore instead of realizing he fucked up and is throwing away a future as a healthy man because he isn\u2019t willing to grieve properly.\n\nKnowing how Viktor ends up in league makes him look like an addict who in a moment of lucidity decides to make a choice that we all know that he isn\u2019t going to follow because he\u2019s already addicted.",

This is why most people suggest picking one champion to learn so you can learn everything around one constant. The game changes just enough each patch, and completely each off season to the point I'd also not suggest picking jungle especially.",

Smurfing is a cancer and should be eradicated with absolutely no exceptions, no matter what the \"learning a new role/champion\" apologists say.\n\nThat being said...\n\nAre you suggesting that he should be able to either play as a high level player with his wife, or smurf yourself, and ONLY fight new players? How is that not equal to smurfing?  \n\nIf you get a new player into the game and don't want them to solo, that's totally reasonable. But you need to do your job and teach them how to play. They're not going to be able to \"feel it out\" like you did. The world changes and League is no exception. \n\nA new player either starts alone, starts with another new player, or starts with an old player who will need to hand-hold them so they don't get steamrolled. There's no better solution. \n\nI'm diamond and my wife is iron. My normals MMR is a cruel joke and floods my games with Masters and GMs if I play them too often. It sucks, but what is the solution?\n\nShould I be allowed to demolish irons all day? How is that better?",

Hopefully over time your wife would get better and your normal mmr would drop \n\nthe master/GM players that are in your normal games are probably because they have low normal mmr (I dont think normal and ranked mmr should be completely separate but that's a hecarim of a different chroma). \n\nI think people have forgotten the original definition of a \"smurf.\" now it's just used as a catchall for alt accounts or higher mmr players. A \"smurf\" was originally defined as someone who ***intentionally*** plays against low ranked players to shit on them by hiding or lying about their skill.  Imho you duoing with your wife on your main or a new account you level yourself doesnt make you a smurf, you still have to work for the win. If you buy an account with low mmr just so your wife wont lose lane when you duo- that would make you a smurf\n\nI guess unless you are a 5 stack all starting together at the same level there isnt much of an \"optimal new player experience\"",

There are also some comics out there, including one called \"Katarina\" on the Webtoon comics platform.\n\nEven if League itself isn't for you, there are other ways to engage with the lore.

League's skillset is unique, so unless you have played other MOBAs, this will be an entirely new experience to you.\n\nAlso, it's hard to play for fun when the game design is based on snowballing. It's really not fun dying 15 times to god knows what (my experience playing against Shaco back in season 1) while your team is screaming insults at you. Multiply it by a hundred until you actually understand what's going on.",

The experience as a new player is toxic as hell -- I've never been told to kill myself so many times in a single week for the audacity of \\*checks notes\\* -- being a new player in a video game. People are insanely toxic, and every game is absolutely infested with smurfs that will just bully you all game and make sure you never get to have any fun. I tried doing that for 30-50 games (roughly) and it never got better, even though I was losing most of my games and only winning the ones where the guy with 26 kills, 0 deaths, and 5 assists was on my team (which still wasn't fun for me because the enemy team was still bullying me constantly).\n\nAs a level &lt;20 player, I was getting matched against players who were level 300-600+ regularly -- people with literally thousands of times more experience than I had, and who were perfectly happy to just follow me all around the map even after lane to make sure I never got to actually play the game. It was \\*\\*actual hell\\*\\*.\n\nIf you can tolerate that, there's a fun game somewhere down the line I'm told, and I can sometimes see flashes of it. But man, the grind to try and get through hell just to get to a point where there's any fun to be had... If I wasn't doing this specifically to have more interests in common with my gf, I really don't think I'd be tolerating it.",

I got introduced by a friend who had only been playing a year and wanted someone to play with. Honestly without having her guidance I probably never would have continued playing. It's not an easy game to learn at all. The tutorial is essentially useless and won't teach you much beyond some champ mechanics and the overall goal of the game. \n\nAs most people have said, getting a friend to play with is an amazing idea! You can either opt for someone who's played for a while and can actually teach you, or find a friend and struggle bus together. Either way, it'll be a fun learning curve! \n\nHonestly, I'd also recommend watching some Pro-Play when you're settled into the game a little bit. It really helped me learn little things I hadn't quite picked up yet and nobody else in my circle would have taught me. Even watching Youtubers/Streamers play can be good as well! \n\nMy biggest recommendation will always be to just take it in your own time. It's not the easiest thing to wrap your head around, there's 160 odd champions and some of them I still couldn't tell you how they work mechanically (looking at Vlad). Just experiment! Don't lock yourself down to one role, branch out and learn everything you can!\n\nAlso, just /muteall",

Mute all chat if you're going to get tilted. \n\n3. Don't spend money on a free game (i.e don't buy skins or anything. Everything except chromas can be RNG rolled for) \n\n4. If you don't have people to play with join some community discords and ask people to play with you. \n\n5. If all else fails only play ARAMs.",

            "comment": "If you want to try it, try it. It's that simple. Don't let random online people sway what you think about the game. Just be aware that it's not new-player friendly in the way most modern games tend to be, and try to find fun in aspects of the game that aren't just \"winning\". For example, I take joy in strategy and learning, both of which I can do even in \"bad\" games that most would define as \"not fun\" for them. I just want to play and learn and function within a team of people who want the same.  \n\n\nIf you go into LoL willing to let the vocal (and highly negative) part of the community help you make your decisions, you likely will have a bad time with it sooner or later, unfortunately. Finding your own positive reasons for playing is very, very important for the long term imo - so if you want to play because you loved Arcane, you should do so! I also recommend perhaps watching some guides on Youtube once you pick a character you'd like to play as. If there's someone you're looking to learn specifically, let me know and I can see if I have any beginner friendly recommendations!",

If you're just playing casually and not really go into the competitiveness of ranked games then the game is pretty fun and there is a lot to learn. Also, the e-sports scene is pretty big and watching the matches is often more fun than playing league itself.\n\nIf you come from Arcane it's also good to narrow down which champions you can try out first, since that is very overwhelming with 160 champs right now.\n\nBut I recommend you don't start alone. The tutorial is horrible,  playing against bots doesn't really help and there are a lot of smurfs (good players with new accounts) in lower elo ranks. Also, if someone you know plays League it's easier for you to understand different concepts, since the tutorial just doesn't tell you a lot",

            "comment": "The game is fun but has a strong barrier to entry. If you know people playing it and willing to play with you, it's worth. If not, it depends if you just like the game and the genre. Anyway, it's time consuming, like any other good game (a match is between 20 and 40 minutes, so it's manageable but very few people manage to only play one match :\\^) ). LoL is like a Super Smash Bros thing in terms of lore.\n\nYou also have the mobile version of it being \"Wild Rift\" (F2P).\n\nIf you like specifically lore, you have several content to play:  \n\\* Card game= **Legend of Runeterra (LoR)** =&gt; Good game very F2P friendly, awesome art and ton of lore (most of the lore come from there nowadays). \\[FREE\\] \\[Solo Campain &amp; Multiplayer\\]  \n\\* RPG Solo: **The Ruined King a League of Legends Story** *(around Yasuo, Ahri, Braum, Pyke, Miss Fortune, Illaoi and Viego)* \\[NOT FREE\\] \\[Solo\\]  \n\\*Hack &amp; slash type thingy: **The Mageseeker** *(around Sylas)* \\[NOT FREE\\] \\[Solo\\]  \n\\*2D platformer: **Convergence a League of Legend story** *(around Ekko)* \\[NOT FREE\\] \\[Solo\\]\n\nAlso, you can also check all the cinematics from LoL, Wild Rift, and LoR if you want MORE LORE and Necrit (youtuber specialized in lore)",

Or are there skins that make them look like it? if so, are they still aviliable? \n\nAnd before i try the real thing, i saw something about a mobile game called \"LOL: Wild rift\" should i try that before, i try the real thing?",

It\u2019s nearly as complex as League, though, so honestly I would just start the real thing and get it over with.\n\nUnless you have a few good friends who already know how to play, or at least one REALLY good friend who is willing to learn the game alongside you, I wouldn\u2019t really recommend it though. Also you\u2019ll need to actually study the game at least a little bit- I\u2019m talking watching gameplay on YouTube and keeping somewhat up to date on the meta builds. It\u2019s a big time and patience sink. But once you get through all that, its the best game ever. Mostly.",

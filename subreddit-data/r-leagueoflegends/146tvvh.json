FENNEL won 2-0 and she ended the series 3/1/22. Replay of the games can be found [on the LJL stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8VMge4YF-g).\n\nFor some background, she originally competed in high school tournament in Japan before joining Rascal Jester as a trainee. She then played for their academy team which placed 7th in 2021 and 5th in 2022, and ahead of this season FENNEL acquired Rascal Jester where she has been their academy support and main team substitute.",

IIRC this is exaggerated from puberty onward as higher testosterone levels will increase risk tolerance.\n\nI'm not saying that has to stay this way forever, but since it's shown from very young age there is most likely an instinctual component to it, the hormonal component (higher risk tolerance increases competitiveness) seems to also be a factor that's unlikely to go away.",

That seems like entirely related to her esport career to me when it was literally payment for her playing and the reason that it was botched to begin with was because of her own manager.",

(She had joined Curse Academy only a month earlier in July, and I'm positive she had been out then too for the record). She was out as trans before she joined any academy teams, let alone Renegades. She had to deal with that sexism (and transphobia) from the start while getting picked up, she was not already in the scene, and she was not on a team.",

She absolutely had to deal with them. She had to deal with so much both sexism and transphobia even just in solo queue before she went pro. In clips she had it'd be filled with shitty comments. Twitch chat was a fucking disaster every time she was on stream. Even on her own stream, mods had to work overtime to not make it a cesspool from what I saw (I didn't watch much though). And she absolutely had to deal with sexism to get picked up by a team, as well as typical esports shit like managers/players being unsure if having a girls, trans or not, in a gaming house was a good idea or whatever.\n\nShit is awful for trans woman now in 2023, and it was socially even worse in 2016. Although horrifyingly enough it may be *politically* worse in 2023 lmao, despite the fact that the average person is more accepting than ever",

Remilia skipped the hardships of being a woman in esports, due to not coming out until already being on a team/gotten her chance. She had her own hardships ofc, being a trans woman in a time where twitch chat was even more toxic than these days.\n\nSo many women don't get that chance due to owners thinking women in teams = drama/love issues/other issues. Remilia didn't have to jump that hurdle, that's why it feels wrong to give her the title. She technically is the first woman, just feels rough for other women who have a huge uphill battle.",

From this statistic, the most logical assertion should be that women that play league and likely other esports aren't interested in playing competitively. Please don't try and tell me societal factors are the reason 97% only pick female champions.\n\nFor the 3% or whatever smaller percentage of women that play this game competitively and want to be in esports, all power to them.

Most women I know have stopped using mics because of how frequently the environment changes as soon as they speak. You just have to see it first-hand.\n\nThe whole nature vs nurture argument doesn't really matter. They feed into each other.

Also, Riot just had a massive lawsuit over how they treat women, do you think the players are going to be more professional than the workers?\n\nI can guarantee you that majority of players are not considering these things when they log in to play the game. While these are important issues when looking at the broad picture, they're not reasons why an individual would choose not to play this game in a competitive manner. These are not factors that affect women from getting to the level required to play competitively.\n\n&gt;10% of the playerbase is female and 97% of these women pick exclusively female champions. Challenger on its own is like the top 0.02% of league players, and the number of pro players is even smaller.\n\nYou've basically decided to ignore this entire point of mine, but its the base of my argument. Majority of women don't play this game to be good at it, they play girl champs for fun. \n\n10% is a minority but still a very significant portion of the playerbase. When you consider that 97%+ of this minority does not even play in a competitive manner, then is that not *by far the biggest factor?*\n\nIf you want to argue that societal factors influence women to be less competitive in League, I would agree if the statistic wasn't something as stupid as 97%. It just really doesn't add up. \n\nI'm sure plenty of players play ranked without any interest in the esports scene. Women choosing not to play ranked aren't thinking \"pro players are all men anyway\", they're thinking \"this shit is not fun\".",

You get games like India vs Andorra, Australia vs Cyprus and the UK vs Guatemala, countries that would normally be nowhere close to international tournaments which helps promote the sport and allows the teams to gain experience. It's the same principle, even though they can also qualify to regular international tournaments we all know that they're never gonna get there since the sport just isn't big enough in those countries.",

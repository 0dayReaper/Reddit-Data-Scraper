Do not get baited by teammates, if you can\u2019t 2v2 DO NOT do it. Veigar, yi level 3 don\u2019t beat Annie ww for example.  Roam timers are essential, if enemy just shoved you under tower they have 8 seconds to come back to mid unpunished. Use them pings, these monkeys on the rift don\u2019t know better. Lastly focus on your champions specific strength and you will carry, through good cspm.",

            "comment": "Funny thing, it wasn't a remake (probably) \n\nTell me, in this invade that failed, the guy that disconnected played sussy and died right? \n\nIf this is what happened, it was the player abusing a deranking method by baiting his team into a remake vote that isn't actually a remake. You lose LP for it. But the client match history may still consider it a remake, but i am not sure about it. I know most external websites assume it was a remake, so if you check the players opgg you'll see a bunch of remakes and tjink nothing of it. \n\nIf it was an actual remake where no one died then idk, thats weird. If the invade happened before minute 1:00-1:20 then it is technically possible for a remake to still happen if someone afks, but if everyone was moving after 1:30 then I am not sure a true remake can happen by then",

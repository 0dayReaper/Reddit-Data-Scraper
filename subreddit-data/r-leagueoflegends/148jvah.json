    "postText": "Recently I've had some friends who quit watching pro play due to Zeri and Yuumi.  I'm in a similar boat where I'll turn off any game where either champ is picked but I still tune in to my favorite teams hoping they'll either be banned or just not picked.\n\nBut this isn't just about pro play this about solo queue as well.  I dodge any game where Yuumi is picked BY EITHER SIDE and I've taken to perma banning Zeri despite not being an ADC main.  New Neeko is just so unfun to play against that I just dodge if it's on the enemy team and I feel the same about many new and reworked champs.\n\nThis isn't to say I never want new champs.  They can add new playstyles and add interest when well designed.  But a part of being well designed means having counterplay and exploitable weaknesses, even when played close to perfectly.  This counterplay and weaknesses part seems to have been forgotten with many new champs.  We need more champs like Millio, Renata, Lillia, Vex, Ksante, and Seraphine.  We need less of stuff like Viego, BelVeth, Akshan, Pyke, Zeri, and the champ I despise most of all Yuumi.\n\nI don't have direct access to player numbers but based on talks with my friends plenty of people are leaving the game over some of these new \"Gimmick\" type of champions.  Neeko is just the latest example of something that has been a serious problem for the past 2 or 3 seasons.",

There's a reason why Ekko's ultimate is an ultimate, not E.\n\nKsante, tanky, a billion moves and dashes and CC, and tons of damage. Why does he have a Yasuo/Yone knock up dash mechanic??",

Viego sucks 1v1 vs most bruisers, is extremely vulnerable to cc with his damage builds, and does zero damage without resets in his tank/heavy bruiser builds. Belveth is also very vulnerable to cc, only does damage with autos, isn\u2019t great at teamfighting and is bad 1v1 early game.\n\nAkshan is a short range adc that needs a lead to do anything, from behind he\u2019s worthless. Pyke scales like dogshit and if he doesn\u2019t win lane or roam to win other lanes should lose.\n\nZeri admittedly is not a great design overall because she\u2019s a very safe hyper scaler, but even still at least in soloqueue it\u2019s exploitable since her early damage sucks. Yuumi makes laning phase essentially a 1v2 where you only have to focus 1 person. I\u2019ll admit yuumi also is poorly thought out.",

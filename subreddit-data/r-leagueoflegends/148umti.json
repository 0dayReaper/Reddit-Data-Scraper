    "postText": "Hi guys!\n\nI just finished my placement games yesterday (5W 5L), I ended up silver two, 50 LP. I was gold last season, I don't play many ranked, just enough to finish gold each season.\n\nSince then, I did 3 ranked games : one win where I won 26 LP and two defeats -24 LP and -26LP\n\nI'm confused, the last seasons when placement matches ended, I generally won 25 LP and lost 15 LP. Did something changed? Does mmr from normal games heavily count? I play a lot in normal with my friends, we are not serious about the game so I guess we lose more than we win.\n\nCould someone enlighten me?\n\nThanks!",

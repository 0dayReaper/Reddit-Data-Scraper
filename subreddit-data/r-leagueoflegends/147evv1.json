    "postText": "Earlier today, BLG put up a post celebrating Elk\u2019s 4 year LPL anniversary. It\u2019s quite interesting, since many in the west have only just gotten to see him for the first time and many think that he\u2019s a really young/new player overall - but actually this marks his 4th year in LPL already\u2026\n\nBefore he was on BLG, he was on Team WE and known as Jiumeng, and even back then he was pretty well known by fans of the LPL. I think this MSI really puts into perspective a real blind spot a ton of fans have on eastern regions, as it felt like the general public was much more shocked about Elk than maybe was justified. Here\u2019s to hoping he\u2019s not just a flash in the pan on that consciousness either!\n\n[https://weibo.com/5926660141/N4RFlrpwn#](https://weibo.com/5926660141/N4RFlrpwn#)",

(Elk is 21 which is young).  \nElk is also called a rookie to the INTL stage (which is fair enough because other 'rookies' like Yike have been playing longer than Elk lol) Its hard to compare east vs west 'young' players when the div 2 scene is so different.",

I barely paid attention to them until last year worlds with JDG.\n\nDidn\u2019t even know teams like WE, TT, NIP, etc even exist. Didn\u2019t even realize that LPL had like 18 teams or however many it is. \n\nSo I\u2019m really not surprised a player that had a name change on a not very well known team in a region with a ton of teams isn\u2019t very well known.",

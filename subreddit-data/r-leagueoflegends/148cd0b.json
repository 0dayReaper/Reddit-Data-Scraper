Peyz got hooked out of charm and during the charm had basically no damage done to him cause Faker was disengaging. T1 already had their frontline die earlier in the fight. And throughout that whole time, Milio is summoner healing, pressing R, and heal pooling the Zeri. Also looks like Oner either misses his R or it does very little damage to the Zeri. Either way, still more fun watching Zeri blow stuff up than watching shit like utility ADC's just sit 2 screens back, imo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still respect your opinion though, we just have differing opinions.",

Now it means that in particular, the two of them cannot trigger Duskblade with their ults and remain effectively untouchable during their high-damage AoE ults. MF as someone mentioned is also a sly abuser of this and to my knowledge I think the same special casing will also apply to her/apply to all champs with a channeling ult.",

If he didn't have flash then he should've stunned her right before Darius died instead of backing off. Good chance she dies from that too. It's possible the stun wasn't up again if he didn't have, like, *any* AH at all but unlikely.\n\nNot to mention he never fucking uses his E while losing 90% of his health lol.",

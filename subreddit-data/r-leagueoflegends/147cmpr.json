I never played comp because I was told that if I did and did poorly, it would be much harder to climb when I got better because of the rank system. So I didn't have a main champ, therefore I couldn't get good enough to play the actual game.\n\nIt's not like there's 10 champs to choose from, there's hundreds, so I used that excuse to keep trying more and more champions until I got burnt out.\n\nThe last characters I was playing before I left were Kindred/Kha'Zix. I kind of don't know if I want to play jungle anymore, but that was my most played role. \n\nThe only lore I actually looked into was Mordekaisers, and it was the coolest I heard about but other than that I don't really know any others.",

                    "comment": "I would stick to a 1-3 champions for a role if you really want to improve and learn. It better to be able to play 1-3 champions well in your role than being able to play 10-20 champions at varying levels of mastery. This way, you can learn your matchups well but since you are playing a champion that you are comfortable with and understand, it allows you to focus more on other aspects of the game like macro instead of having to worry about your individual skill and playing the game. You play a bunch of champions in different roles so I would recommend finding a role to stick with and a couple of champs for that role.\n\nTaking teleport does not necessarily mean you are sacrificing kill pressure. It enables you have more presence on the map whether it is to quickly respond to a roam, gank, or dive, flanking during an engagement, or applying pressure to a lane. In this case, LB does need ignite to have kill pressure since she already has a lot of burst. She is much more mobile than you and taking teleport makes it even more so. So I wouldn't say that her not taking ignite makes this matchup easier for you. \n\nVision is so important with how much information you get from it. Well placed wards can reveal roams and ganks well in advanced to give you enough time to react. It can also spot junglers out in their jungle so you can predict their pathing so you can position properly (i.e., if a ward spots jungler topside, I will position more towards bot so if a gank does come, I have more time and space to react or my team can plan a counter-gank). Also, depending on their comp, it will also dictate how far you have to ward. If the enemy has a Twitch or a Zac, I tend to ward a bit deeper so I can spot out Zac when he is winding up for a jump or Twitch right as he goes invisible. A vision score of 8 for a 20 minute game is really low. \n\nAs you're learning, its okay to play passively and safe. The best thing you can do is stay alive, farm up where you can, and be there with your team when going into teamfights. Games aren't always won based on 1v1s or you losing your lane. I'm sure you've seen instances where a team wins despite being down kills, lost lane, or having a fed teammate. As much as being able to play your champion well is important, understanding your role and responsibilities on what you bring to the team and having macro is equally as important. \n\nHope this helps lol its super general but some of these really did help me learning the game.",

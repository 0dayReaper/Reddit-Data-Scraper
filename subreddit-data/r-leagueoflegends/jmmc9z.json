With the new system introduced a couple of seasons ago, I felt like we're moving backwards with it. \n\nSometimes after I won a game, I want a way to show my opponents that I enjoyed play against them and they did well, despite the loss.\n\nIt's just a \"social\" feature that needs to be in the game. \n\nWhat do you think about it?",

The metaphor is a good relatable one but the source of the issues are different.\n\nLeague's corruption stems from the fact that you are playing with an audience that looks for ways to abuse the system in all directions; up or down, and plenty of that audience enjoys causing stress and troubles to other members of the community. League in a way has become the place where people just let off steam and enjoy leveraging the platform to pass on their misery to other people. \n\nEven good \"citizens\" of the community are prone to this, intentional or not. You can be a role model player and yet how often do you decide to refuse to FF or some other action for a game because it's the person who fed or is running it down that decides to quit and complain? Or worst we feel that the person is intentionally doing this, ruining our experience so we take action to spite them. We can't let them \"win\" by having their own way so we drag on the game and the process, hurting ourselves more and then potentially those around us in the games to follow. Multiply this by 4 (assuming it's only 1 perpetrator) and you have 4 more games where that negative attitude ripple effect will exist and continue the chain in subsequent games.\n\nThis will always exist because Riot doesn't have a system in place to de-incentivize the challenges. Smurf problems, bottom feeding, boosting, just to name a few of the issues. All of those challenges will continue to exists and cause a toxic community until Riot figures out a way to change the behaviour. To their fairness, they have invested a considerable amount of effort looking into this. The problem they face is having to go back on their viewpoints, which might cause a riot from the community (no pun intended). For example: not allowing smurf accounts, or at least taking the action to remove them when identified. Riot could never take that stance based on how they have conducted for the last 10 years and how they support the high elos / pros purpose to do this. But having that stance on smurfs does remove 2 of the 3 problems mentioned.  \n\nLeague is one of the largest if not largest player bases for games out there, these sort of issues are to be expected, in ways. I think the challenge people have is the fact that 10 years now and not a lot of ground to solving some of them has taken place, especially the ones that cause ripple effect issues and tilting players. \n\nLoL's communities are really bad, worst than they need to be but Riot is not without it's share of the blame. This is referred to in game design as cursed problems: an unsolvable design problem with the game where it is rooted in a conflict between a promised experience and the objectives of the game. \n\nThe best way to describe that is like the game of Risk. With Risk you want the game to be fun (experience), but the game demands politics to win (objective) and those two conflict. In this circumstance you can't have both because how you want the game to play and how it needs to play conflict. There are generally 4 ways to solve \"cursed\" game design problems, and the term \"solve\" is used lightly:  \n\n\n1. De-incentivize by either hiding the information or giving a negative \"reward\" (punishment) for the action - to discourage people from doing it.   \nRiot hides jungle timings, but not completely. Riot has the dodge queue timer for AFK / dodge behaviour.  \n\n2. Deconstruction of the negative behaviour - don't allow the mechanic that caused the negative behaviour (question is, does this break the game?).   \nThink of the removal of DFG or feral stacks and funneling strategies, etc.  \n\n3. Putting in a different, replacement positive behaviour to encourage players to do that thing more than the bad thing.  \nThe changes Riot has made to the rift herald over the years (whether effective or not different story), in order to make play around top a strategy instead of always just bot and dragons.  \n\n4. Run with it, make it fun. If you can't stop the undesired behaviour, find a way to turn it into a part of the game.   \nExample: everyone finding ways to be annoying and doing CDR builds to spam champion abilities - Riot instead introduces URF. Players constantly wanting to fight in 1 lane, the good ole NARAM, Riot makes ARAM a mode. (Chicken or the egg comment for which came first lol).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways all this to say, the challenges Riot has are complicated but none of them will go away until they start deciding on their stance more predominantly around these issues. Take cheating for example, if you're caught cheating it's 100% a ban, it's condoned and everyone knows that. But if you're caught boosting? Well it's not against the rules even though many people frown upon it. For it to be against the rules, Riot would have to also be against smurfing, which they aren't officially so how could they be against boosting? Funny how policy works and how it directly impacts the system.",

These are fundamentally the issue of why League has some of the problems it does - Riot hasn't taken a proper stance on what it wants to do with some behaviour and thus the actions it will take to combat it (steps 1-4).",

From there they can earn their degree while playing or not. There are far, far fewer handouts in college than in high school for athletes. If an athlete graduates with a degree but isn't good enough to go pro, then they are at the same level as anyone else. If they play for a school with a lot of fans, someone might hit them up with some car dealership job or some random office job, but it really doesn't give them instant access like it does in high school.\n\nMany high schools in the US make money off of their sports programs, especially private schools, so it is in their best interests to do whatever it takes to keep players on the field/court.",

This could be nostalgia but back than I used to meet a lot of nice funny and kind people in aram atleast twice a day in 10 matches. now even Aram is full of toxic people who keep shit talking you, their teammates and ruin the general mood. Riot realy needs to so something to reward non toxic behavior more because right now all chat is ruining the game",

I have three of them and haven't used them because I don't play twitch, or warwick, and I already have skins for those champs that I like more.  \n\nHow about for each point your awarded after a game for honor you get points, end of the week they add your points up and those  that received honors and no suspensions for the season get a mystery skin orb or summoner icons or maybe, you get put into an \"honorable\" queue and get faster load times.  \n\nPersonally I wish they'd bring a new iteration of the Tribunal back.  We need more eyes on the trolling intentionally ruining games stuff.  There has to be a better way to do tribunal.  Maybe offer players a \"Referee\" position?  Review questionable games for riot and get small amounts of riot points for assisting?",

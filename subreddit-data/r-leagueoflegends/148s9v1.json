    "postText": "Hi r/leagueoflegends, I'm puzzled by how the switch to grandmaster is made, I read an article made by riot that, as of april 2023, to reach grandmaster you need to reach 200 lp, then you need to be higher than last currently placed grandmaster. After i did that I waited the daily ranked update and was bummed to find myself still in master..\n\nThere's also a 375 lp account still sitting in master after the update.\n\nI just don't understand the way it works and can't find a clear explanation anywhere.\n\nEDIT: 45 minutes after the daily update I've been promoted to grandmaster :D",

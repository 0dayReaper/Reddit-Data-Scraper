    "postText": "Finally got back to my peak, this time we went for a different approach.  After the changes I feel like Ivern is soo good in lane. So I'v been queueing mid/top and it's actually gone pretty decent after some time. Today masters was achieved  How I play it: After laning mid, gaining levels really quickly I realized how well Ivern scales on EXP and around the Daisy Upgrades. When playing in lane ivern has an expectional kit for both poking, taking poke, holding waves and pushing. Few champions has that. You can hold a wave for SOOO long with your e. Giving you both EXP advantage and kill pressure.  I always run TP/FLASH. This is due to the sheer amount of controll you can have on your lane with teleport.\n\nBuildpath and way of thinking: Usually it's an Liandrys into Cosmic rush. After that if they have assassins I go Zhonyas, if not I go straight into Rabadons ( Snowball games ). Pre-6 I usually set myself one goal. Soak as much gold and exp as possible, and fullstack manaflowband. You don't want to take excessive fights and run from lane too much pre 6. At 6 you send it. You absolutely send it down with Daisy. When you see you start to reach 6, bait the enemies to jump onto you, using your shield as slow, pop daisy and thats a free kill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs Ivern Full AP you dont really ever want to be in the middle of the fight as IVERN, you need to micromanage Ivern and fullfocus on how to positionate Daisy right, use her to flank, to pop a slow so your team can engage on etc.  I can't emphasize how important this is : GET YOUR 11 AND 16 ULT UPGRADES. It doesn't really matter how much AP you have etc. If your daisy is weak. Daisy is 70% of the champion when you go full ap. If she doesnt hit those upgrades quickly you'll fall off so fast! So when you see Daisy get oneshot, find a sidelane and soak some exp, that's literally the most important part in this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIvern is quick and easy AF to split with, if you got zhonyas and are fed you can easily 1v3 if you play it right with Daisy. Make sure to put down Bushmaker(W) on yourself while daisy hits the turrets, making her proc the on hit aswell, superstronk. One protip, if you don't know.\n\nYou can still hit Inhibitors with Daisy, all you have to do is HOLD ALT while RIGHTCLICKING on the NEXUS.  Weird that it has to be like that but it is what it is.

Just do the same thing, keep lane in a good position, last hit and be annoying. At 6 u go all in surprising then, getting easy solobolo cause as of right now, daisy is kinda cracked (which she has to be due to her squishyness)",

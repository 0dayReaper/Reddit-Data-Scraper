At least not griefing me, probably because griefers want attention and griefing people who don't reply or speak in chat or change their gameplay isn't a fulfilling experience for the troll.\n\nI played a session Saturday, ten ranked games, 8-2, no leavers on either side. Only one game ended before 24 minutes out of the ten. No \"smurfs\" dumpstering games. The quality of my games is probably the highest is has ever been, and I've played the game forever.\n\nMute chat and 95% of what you perceive as \"griefing\" is easily explained as people just being bad at the game, and you can move on and not let it ruin your day.",

So a majority of those who are left still playing are the same ones you say should stop. Even fun modes like ARAM is full of egotistical players who can't work as a team. Low rank is all smurfs of banned players or bored high rank players.  All of the sane people have moved on and stopped playing  for good reason. \n\nHonestly i think the mix of too many champions + power creep + catering to pro play over the millions of regular players is what put the game in the mess it is today. The weakest link is more impactful than the strongest link in solo queue.  That and champion/mastery/item power creep has gotten to a point that counter play through pure skill is less relevant than counter play through champ select among similar ranked opponents.",

But it just feels like the low level accounts decide the game and if there are none the team that has more mentally stable players wins. Skill doesn't feel like the most important thing anymore and that's a huge issue.\n\nNow the smurfs not only decide the game they are also hugely toxic and will run down at the slightest issue because they don't care about the account.\n\nBut hey atleast riot ignores the issue since start of the season.

Most players have thousands of games under their belts and have settled in at whatever rank they will be at for life (unless...#2). Also things like autofill and allowing first timing champs and new champs in ranked doesn't help maintain any of the competitive integrity left. \n\n2. ...bought accounts. It's a couple bucks and you have a ready to go smurf account with fresh MMR. Go on a nice winstreak and you can fly past your main while having good gains because for some reason your main gets +20 -27 with a positive WR. This demotivates people to actually care about the outcome of the game and not play for fun. God forbid somehow you manage to get banned who cares.\n\n3. Riot is doing very little. If I launched the game right now and type nothing and die 20 times walking down lanes nothing will happen to my account. Full stop. At this point they dug themselves too big of a hole to fix it without just introducing insane rewards for good behavior and strictly enforcing said system off reports. Like pick any skin you want at the end of a split. \n\nBecause of points 1 and 2 I don't think it will ever get better. I VERY rarely feel like im ever in a competitive lobby of players who want to improve and climb. Most lobbies people are troll picking, first timing shit, perma typing, AFKing, etc. Obviously worse cause im in NA. The biggest LoL streamer is inting plat games for fun and trying to go on massive loss streaks (idc but find it funny).",

I can spend an hour running 16 sets against the same guy and lose all but one of them but it doesn't even register as an annoyance, the game's just fun to play and most peoples' willingness to run sets even when you start to outperform them shows a very different culture with regards to learning and improving. Meanwhile the odds are damn near 10 to 1 that if i boot up league and queue into a normal game I'll get a lot of the same behavior in OP's video.\n\nI don't know how anyone is supposed to even begin approaching fixing the culture problems league has cultivated. I used to think that adding more for-fun content and stepping back from the relentless e-sports pandering would help but after a dozen waves of urf bringing the exact same vibe as regular league and watching nexus blitz get snuffed in the cradle it's clear that the very concept of rolling back is a nonstarter.",

They shouldn't be this low, nor should they be shoved in to begin with. \n\nAnnie and Lucian got double dicked on in lane then got ganked because of it and lashed out and idiots like you still defend it.\n\nMore like they don't know the jungle matchup at all and expect wukong to be able to be bot lane after starting blue buff instead of respecting the enemy jungler's presence and leaving their tower when they're that low. Better yet, how about not being that low before that? How shit did they play the lane to be so low and shoved in so quickly?",

The entire roster is viable in online play, and a large majority of characters are viable in pro.\n* There are no dead roles or character types; your agency doesn't suffer due to what you like to play\n* Despite still having its faults, the ranked matchmaking in GG feels superior to League at most levels below the top divisions. Climbing is easy as long as you improve your own skills.\n* Double-blind picking means you never get counterpicked and lose in draft\n* No game is lost 15 minutes before it's over. Comebacks are always possible.\n* Much more room for outplay and high-visibility skill expression. Stat-checking literally does not exist. If you're better than your opponent, you'll win, and you'll look amazing doing it.",

My team was:\n\n3-7 Top saying that I was bad\n\n1-8 Jungle saying that I had 0 game knowledge and wasn't doing that good\n\n0-9 ADC\n\n1-9 Support\n\nLike how are you actually meant to win that? I tried to calm these guys down, stop them from taking bad fights and setup some decent plays because the game was winnable but they straight up refused. I swear some players just dont want to win, they play out of autopilot and start flaming when it doesn't go their way.\n\nI feel like most players play out of ego and think that they're so much better than everyone else. Imagine being 1-8 and flaming the only person on the team doing good.",

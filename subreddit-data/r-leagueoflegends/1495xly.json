So you could utilize that even without Hurricane. That'd make the change less ham-fisted and specific (wouldn't need to know about specific interactions related to Hurricane in particular). Obviously not stacking on multiple champions at once, but I honestly don't see why they couldn't stack on multiple minions at once even now. Not like you can apply them faster than now without Hurricane anyway so it'd just make her smoother to play and less punishing. Stronger, sure, but outside Hurricane probably not by as much as you might think.",

So his locked into RNG cause of that, same thing happened to UZI except UZI\u2019s contract expired this year. The main thing is that RNG exploited how young these players were and how unorganized the scene was at the time. RNG has also through out the years been reported to not pay their employees on time or at all if they are been let go. Xiaohu was famously sold to WBG this season cause RNG was forced to do so after WBG sued them for damages, as RNG owed WBG a lot of money from the Breathe, Bin, theShy deal that happened last season. So yeah, RNG is ran in a pretty shit way and a lot of the RNG fans were simply fans of the players and not the org, myself included.",

He played most fights pretty defensive and still did a lot of damage.",

You need insanely high win streak, or win rate to do it and you can't climb steadily. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt also is a bad experience when you play three games a day, and end up gaining only 3-4LP in total even though you ended up with 66% winrate that day.",

Every Div 4 is full of griefing because the consequences for losing aren't felt.

It looks larger than current plat, which means it would be including current Gold 2 players all the way to plat 1 players. The skill difference between gold 2 and Diamond 4 is enormous from what I've seen. Isn't this gonna give those lower ranked players too large of a skill gap to climb?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIMO the skill jump and time required to go from like silver 4 to gold 4 is so much lower than from plat 4 to D4.",

The way the bell curve flattens means that the majority of players will be in higher ranks but the overall quality of them also gets pushed along. This is especially important given the % of players who will hit Diamond will remain about the same. Think of it like this: If you're currently in high Bronze, you will be pushed more into low Silver, but you won't be the only one like that. And every rank up through Plat will have that occurring alongside it. With a larger portion of Plat players going into Emerald (alongside, most likely, some of the lowest Diamonds who are D4 0LP), and players who are currently high Gold replacing them, cascading down. \n\nIn effect, this'll mean that there's no hard majority rank anymore like there currently is with the majority of the playerbase being G4 0LP or below. The playerbase median now spreads out, so it'll more likely be that the majority of the playerbase will sit below G1 0LP rather than G4 0LP, with more skilled players able to progress beyond that rather than being in the top 50% for just hitting Gold followed by a sheer drop at Plat. So while people's ranks will increase, the general skill level of the middle ranks will slightly decrease and then increase again at Emerald.",

With the faster LP progression, players are reaching places they would end up anyway over time, just more quickly. That said, the original design of Master+ didn\u2019t account for such a high population, and it has been steadily increasing over the years. There\u2019s probably improvement to make to the progression experience when the next milestone for a Master tier player is Grandmaster at 800 LP away, and it\u2019s important that this level of play is perceived as prestigious. At the end of the day though, if you\u2019re in the top 0.5% of\u2026 really anything a lot of people do, you are really good at it.\n\n\nIt's nice reading this, a lot of my friends hit masters this season and keep self deprecating themselves that they only got there due to ranked inflation. I also had felt similar levels of imposter syndrome hitting much higher than previous peaks this season.",

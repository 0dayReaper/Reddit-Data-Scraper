    "postText": "Before anyone says \"ban her\" yeah, I get it. But there's 100 other characters in the game and learning how to best play against as many of them as possible is best for long term success.\n\nHow do you beat / stop Samira? I don't think I've ever seen her with less than 2-4x amount of kills to deaths in any of my games. How are you supposed to stop a character he literally dashes into the middle of 5 people, ults, and gains health faster than the bar can display, all while doing the most damage? At times it feels like this character was made by mistake or the numbers are off? As soon as level 6 hits, it's GGs every game, never seen her stopped before. Play aggressive early to get a lead / have her get behind, awesome I'm 3-0 she's 0-3, I'm up an items andddddd level 6 she's the strongest in the server. Quadrakill here Pentakill there, dashing in the middle of 5v1s no problem, kill everyone and escape with 97% HP, like what?\n\nBut on a serious note, please help this clueless noob who's posting out of anger after getting absolutely stomped by this ridiculous character.\n\nEdit: I probably should have mentioned that I main ADC, most of the time it's Caitlyn. I have been playing some Xayah as well, which I saw someone mention below. So as much as I appreciate the responses regarding Support characters and tactics, I would have to relay to my buddy who usually plays Support when we duo. Thanks to everyone with serious replies.",

The best advice I can give you, play 10 games with her and see what her trading pattern looks like.\n\nIf you are looking for a champion, Xayah.",

            "comment": "Im a samira OTP with 1.5m points on her, altho i play her mid here are some tips.\n\nCC is samira's worst enemy, interrupt her ult and she would have to rebuild her stacks for another one which is hard without an e reset or while w is not up.\n\nPicks like nautilus, amumu, blitzcrank, cc junglers counter her hard. Her winrate goes down by a looot when there are heavy cc champs in the game, fiddle, amumu, seju, reksai, zac, all these do very well vs samira. Ask your team if they can pick cc to counter samira so she doesnt get out of control. Some other picks that come to mind that do well against samira are taric, rell, ali, janna, annie, wukong, pantheon, all reliable cc.   \n\n\nNILAH, nilah has an extremely good winrate into samira, it kinda hard counters her in every way, the nilah ''ghost form'' makes it so samira's autos dont give her stacks for her ult, and even if samira does get enough stacks for an ult, nilahs ult will cancel the samira ult if used correctly, by far the best pick into samira. \n\nSamira struggles going in without setup, dont walk into her E range if you cant actually 1v1 or 2v2 her. If samira does e in, she has no escape if she has no flash and doesnt get a reset, her only way out is walking back and u should punish her if she does. \n\nHer w, the twirl windwall is on a LONG COOLDOWN: 30 / 28 / 26 / 24 / 22, you have to keep an eye out for this ability when you are playing champs that have an important projectile ability like an ashe ult, varus ult, ornn ult, even renata ult. CC abilities that can bypass samira W are the best into her, a NAUT ult is not w'able",

By the time you're back on the floor, you can QSS or cleanse just the same as now.\n\nSo, while it would be a nerf for sure, I don't think it would fix the fundamental issue, while only making it feel much worse for the Neeko players.  \nAt that point, just lowering damage and CC or her R or decreasing the ult range would accomplish the same dip in winrate while not requiring the players to relearn a mechanic.",

The history of the game has multiple examples outlining EXACTLY this issue. A stealth mechanic allowing a player to execute their entire burst combo with no warning to the target whatsoever...\n\nObjectively/historically, the powers of balance at Riot have time again learned this lesson the hard way (Evelynn, Rengar, Kha'zix). Even abilities like Lissandra E and Kayn's walk-through-walls thing have indicators for enemies because of their very long effective range on a non-ultimate ability. That level of surprise conflict 99% of the time makes the unhealthy play pattern of opposing that mechanic outweigh the positive play pattern of playing as that stealth champ.\n\nThe game is proliferated with evidence that the balance team *should* know what is right and wrong. *Consistency matters*. And even if they don't know what is right and wrong, they could play the fucking game and find out.\n/rant",

If her passive broke to damage like before there would be no point in becoming a minion since that is the first thing any champ attacks. I main neeko so I know how useless her passive was before. Fiddle ult doesnt have counter play either, you just get feared from no vision and probably die if he ults you. Shaco can become invisible and one shot with a basic attack. In those situations there is literally nothing you can do if you don\u2019t expect them coming. Even if you don\u2019t count the minions, you can assume that she is one if you don\u2019t see her on the map and her W passive even reveals her.",

Her surprise mechanic is so strong especially in this clip because the enemy team just wiped her team and can finally push the 1st tower so that's probably what they want to do. They ignore the 4th melee minion and get punished for it.\n\nYou can also see which minion she is because it glows. Yeah it's very strong but beforehand when her passive broken from damage she was utter rubbish",

Taking that away would make the champion very unfun to play again and she would lose a lot of players.\n\nSo, I think they will instead try to shift power out of the ult by decreasing damage or CC or make it so it's harder for her to get such ults. Maybe through making her disguise wear off if she gets hit while casting ult or something like this..",

But 4 archangels gave bonkers amount of ap, i swear i remember hitting 1.5k not too hard.

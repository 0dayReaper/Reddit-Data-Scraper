    "postText": "My last 10 games in Diamond have featured junglers being banned 78 out of 100 bans.  Jungle is OP in high elo.  Jungle needs nerfed so other roles can have more impact.  Ask any top laner, which is more important outplaying your enemy laner or getting the jungler.  100/100 top laners will tell you getting the jungler is better.  This level of banning means that tons of non junglers are banning junglers because there's just so many that are OP and in need of nerfs.  All of this and Khazix is the only jungle nerf next patch you just can't make this up lol\n\nMid lane has devolved into support whatever your jungler is doing or lose and it sucks.\n\nIf your against a mid jungle smurf duo you might as well FF.\n\nJungle and support just has way too much impact and agency in any elo above gold.  I'm not an expert on how exactly to fix jungle but I do know it's OP and in need of nerfs but instead the devs are wasting time on a Teemo ASU.",

If I am blue team, I get counter picked every single time.\n\nIf I am red team, its a 50/50 if the last pick will actually swap with me. If its a mid with last pick, he will just almost always refuse to swap, and if its anyone else its basically a toss up.\n\nDoes most top laners just threaten to run it down if they dont get last pick, or how do red team tops make sure to always get last pick? Its basically a 50% chance for me with everything added up",

Removed cause people who dont play jungle cant do that and its unfair to them\n\n\nYou could have healthy and faster clears as machete user if you knew how to kite? Removed cause it takes too much to learn the pathings for non experienced junglers and its toxic.\n\nYou can be up 50-60cs and 3/4 kills that you'd only be 1 or max 2 levels ahead on the enemy jungler.\n\nThe only reason jungle is \"op\" is because now anyone can play the flavour of the month champ and do as good as anyone else cause jungle skill expression is not a thing anymore, the only form of skill there is right now is macro, every mechanic that good junglers could pull have been taken out of the game in favor of \"expanding jungle's player pool\" while it still is n\u00b01 autofill role along toplane",

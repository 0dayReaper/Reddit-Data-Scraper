    "postText": "With the support Ashe buffs, I'm sure that we will be seeing a lot more of her on the rift. This also means, there's going to be a lot of noobies making this mistake; don't buy AP on support Ashe pre-6.  \"What!? But I'm going AP Ashe!!! I need AP!\"\n\nAshe has 0 AP scaling pre 6. It's all on her ultimate, so that amplifying tome you're buying is useless. Except that it's actually worse than useless, because you *LOSE STATS*. Your adaptive force from runes? That's AP now. So you paid 435g to lose damage on your auto attacks and Volley. Great job!\n\nFaerie Charm, Ruby Crystal, and boots are your best friends. You don't have to go for something like Umbrail Glaive, just please hold off on buying that Bandleglass Mirror until level 6 please.\n\n(Also if you're building **Echoes of Helia** you need **Font of Life** to proc it - don't make that mistake either!)",

Ashe fed hard all because I told her to stop building AP pre-6, I wasn't even agressive once and explained thoroughly. She didn't like the idea of me telling her what to do. So she kept hitting my minions to the point I lose some, ks'ed every chance she get, fully blames jungle even though not him nor enemy jungle came bot once, and told crucial detail like ally pathing to enemy for vantage points.\n\nWe still won that game thankfully to me getting fed late game and our Kayn a 1v9 master. Ashe players are just a different breed man..",

The passive counted as it's own auto towards Zyra plants so you could one shot them with an auto or Q (which is no longer the case, was nerfed). Make it rain was a problem with support MF but wasn't because it one shot Zyra plants (it never did). It was a problem because you would max it for 300 damage with a hefty slow on a 8 sec cd lol or some shit like that - it was heavily nerfed.",

She can amplify the pressure of another long range poke adc (Cait, Jhin or Varus are good with her) well, also if you get a bot laner who is one of the rare APC players (Karthus, Swain, Veigar, Seraphine etc) Ashe support is very good with them cause the slows help them land spells and you can chain cc and poke very hard and with mixed damage. However both requires Ashe to pressure in lane and not wait til 6 to be an ult bot (picking Ashe support just for ult is very grief anyway since enemy adc will just go cleanse if they have a brain). Also idk if it's *good* but I do like and have success with her into Yuumi as the best way to beat Yuumi is to just shove her carry in and take plates before they can scale, Ashe can run the carry into tower with undodgeable poke and takes plates well. Also can rush executioner's to keep GW on (less useful after Yuumi update, tbf).",

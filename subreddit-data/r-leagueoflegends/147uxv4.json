Since every weird playstyle is bad if u play it normally.\n\nFunneling, Twitch top/supp. The old Janna top strat. Everything of that is just counterd by not panicking and playing it normal. But naaaah people tend 2 freak out and try shit plays bcs they think they need to. Dont do the same shit plays they do, no reason to do so. You ALWAYS outscale the Teams who use those strats. Get that in ur head. FFS\n\n(Yes im mad and yes i just lost a game where that happend)",

If your team does nothing you simply lose.\n\nAll you need to do is play around the bit that they gave up on for the strat. \n\nJanna top worked so well BECAUSE she scales so hard. As long as there is another bruiser/tank as a frontline janna makes the teamfighting insane and doesnt need gold for it so she just puts the enemy jungler far enough behind he cant take advantage of a janna top.\n\nIf you simply focus toplane and make her stay in lane and towerdive her to stop you from getting inhib at 16 minutes, her entire gameplan falls apart.",

But forcing fights everywhere while we know that every fight will be a 4v5/3v4/2v3/1v2 since a toplaner cannot move very good b4 min 10. And the Janna strat worked out well bcs of the bounty system nothing else. Thats why riot didnt nerf janna, they rather changed the system itself",

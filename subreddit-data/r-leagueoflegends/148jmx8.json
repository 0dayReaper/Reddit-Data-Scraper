            "comment": "It's a weird situation, horizon focus doesn't really have a place because shadowflame deals more damage basically every time the only difference is horizion have a bit of ability haste and grant vision on the target but thats kinda niche, if you make it stronger than shadowflame, shadowflame becomes useless, these 2 items just have to compete and the stronger ones will always be picked over.\n\nPerhaps a fix would be to make shadowflame work like serpahnt feng and just reduce shields, currently it's anti-shield niche isn't ever a factor it's just always a good damage buy even with 0 shields. then you have horizion for more overall damage and shadowflame as a real anti-shield.",

I don't think Horizon needs to exist as another boring, pure damage stat stick, but as long as it's in the game, it should probably have more of a damage amp so it can be like a cheaper Rabadon's that only a few mages have access to",

That's another time I got faked out by this game and my blood pressure is rising just thinking about these two situations.",

ATM, you can choose between either of them depending on what you wish (more cadence vs more power), or build them both together as the game goes on to gain both of their strenghts.\n\nCDR for mages is specially valuable in the current system, so taking it away, specially for artillery mages of all champs, is the wrong move. At that point just remove the range requirement and vision effect and make it another burst mage + assassin item since obviously it's not being catered towards the original artillery champs.\n\nagree that health should be removed though.",

Something like:\n\n&gt;Dealing ability damage to a champion with an ability that is neither unit-targeted nor auto-targeted at more than 700 units away or slowing, immobilizing or polymorphing them reveals them, reduces your basic abilities' current cooldowns by X% of their total cooldown, and increases your damage dealt to them by 10% for 6 seconds.",

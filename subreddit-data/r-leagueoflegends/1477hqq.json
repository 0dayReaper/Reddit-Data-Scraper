I can't tell you the number of times I've been typing up a comment and seen someone post exactly what I'm trying to say.\n* Reddit's really only good for reaching a small but highly engaged portion of the English speaking world. If something's important to say, then it's better to put it in patch notes or a dev blog so everyone can read it.\n* It's intimidating! I'm happy most of my comments have been positively received so far, but it's definitely scary every time I hit the 'comment' button.\n\nAnd since this is as good a place as any to make my official introduction:\n\nHi everyone!  \nI'm Riot HuntedFork and I work as an engineer on the Behavioral Systems team. I'll be around sometimes, say hi if you see me :)",

Any random reddit comment has to be taken with a large grain of salt. Riot might entirely agree with any one comment, but until they acknowledge that agreement it's the just take of some rando on the internet.",

Its a bit sad that we are losing contents like the old Riot Nexus ones that explained why rammus only know six words or how jinx born from a Katie De Sousa's draw. I dont mind if it's in reddit, lol page or whatever but i think that Riot should bring back that kind of contents that, even if not giving a lot of \"direct\" return, helped a lot for us the folks around the world that spread the League word.  \n\n\nPS: Not native english, hope it can be understood.",

Even before it was part of my job, it was one of the things I enjoyed most as a player. I think that in this somewhat more serious part of communication, surely necessary after the start of the year, that somewhat more fun and lighthearted approach is lost.  \nStill, I have only good words for how you are doing things right now. It can't be easy to be in that situation and this is just the cry of someone who misses that perhaps more curious but less important part of Riot Games contents.",

I understand every project gets its own resources, but shit the difference between Senna cinematic and Nilah's is kinda cringe. \n\n4) Life of patch. This was so dope. \n\n5) most recently you guys started with \"Devs Spill The Beans\" and just... stopped?\n\nI am sure there are plenty more examples, but yeah, that's some feedback. /u/Cashmiir",

The main thing for us is: Is there a good story that we can tell on video? We had the challenge during the pandemic where we couldn't film people on campus since COVID was a problem. :D That said, we are currently working on a dev diary for League that we finished filming last week!\n4. (this is 4 but the formatting changes it to 2). Life of a patch is something we're not sure if we'd want to bring back 1:1 because it would just be the same content. That said, we've been talking about other areas where we could do this outside of balance/patch.\n5. (again, this is 5 lmao) We are still doing Beans! But as I said, our team works on every game. We've done Beans for Wild Rift and are doing them for other games as well! We also do the Dev Updates, which have taken a lot of our bandwidth. Like the dev diary BTS videos, these also require opportunity. Beans are meant to let the devs who are SUPER passionate about something nerd out on camera. Not saying that folks aren't passionate. But Aurelion Sol, for example, was a great opportunity because Riot King Cobra is THE ASol main at Riot. He literally dreams about ASol. And then Phlox was another great opportunity because he's a jungle main, so it wasn't just a design problem for him, it was a problem HE personally feels when he plays League.\n\nFor video, there's also something to be said about devs' comfort on camera. Not everyone is comfortable being on camera, and I never want to put people in situations where they don't feel safe/comfortable. So sometimes if we see an opportunity, we don't move forward with it because they don't want to be on camera, which is totally fine!\n\nDo I think we can be doing more content? Yeah probably. But we're also trying to balance multiple games with a small team (we also work on unreleased games like Project L).\n\nWe are really excited about some of the upcoming content that we've got for League (Champion Insights, Dev Updates, dev blogs, and the Dev Diary I mentioned). We do want to do more stuff as we get towards the end of the year! But I will also take this feedback back to the team to see if we can try to find more opportunities!",

Should they have snuck in a nerf for the 3rd highest presence ADC in LPL a day before the patch hit? That's the only thing the could have done at best.\n\nIf i am Phreak and i am getting blamed for Zeri being OP i just would just close reddit",

Hecarim/Udyr meta only got stale, but people talked as if it's been cancer since day 1. People even turned on Taliyah, who I think is such a fun and fair pro champ. So I get the complaints about pro meta, but I hate when people use that to argue about soloq.",

But it's not much of a conversation.  Reddit AMA's are very NA-centric.  Doesn't mean we can't do them, we just want to make sure they're actually worth it.\n\nSome of the reasons already mentioned are perhaps why some Rioters don't respond much on Reddit, but also, this community is very active and often yall respond to each other with answers that we might.  In addition the conversation here can move on VERY quickly, where unless we comment super fast things get buried.  It's also not a great format for debate or go back-and-forth so it tends to be a one response kind of thing.\n\nBut trust we're here and read and appreciate your feedback.

Those include the Diablo Immortal reveal (\"Do you all not have phones?!\"), the Blitzchung ban and firing of the casters that interviewed him, the announcement that Overwatch 2's PvE content has been cut and will not be released, etc.",

            "comment": "Hey OP,   \n\n\nI'm the Senior Community Manager of League. This is essentially one of my jobs. To make sure we're finding ways to communicate to you all, in both new and tried and true methods. Truthfully we actually communicate to you all a lot, like A LOT. I've worked at a handful of other studios and projects at this point and I've never seen so many things constantly going on like this before. It's great and I love it. We have a lot of people that care about staying in touch with you.   \n\n\nOne thing you're absolutely right on is more of the \"higher profile things\" especially on Reddit. As you may have noticed lately we've shifted a bit more into blogs and the dev update video series, which so far seem to be going great, but they do lack some of that 1 to 1 feel you get in places like Reddit. We actually do plan out time to be on here after those release, but we aren't doing things specifically for Reddit at the moment. So maybe that's why it \"feels\" like its been missing lately. We have some future plans to do some things on Reddit specifically so on that front for some higher profile moments just know that we're talking about AMAs. Of course you can always expect rioters to engage whenever they want. We're pretty open here and you'll actually see rioters posting really often.  \n\n\nThere's also the whole \"Reddit is primarily English/NA/EUW focused, and League is a big game with big audiences in a lot of places\" but that sounds more like an excuse so I won't give it. While it's true, I totally get how it might feel as an NA player. We're in a lot of places, talking to a lot of people.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Totally understand what you're asking for here OP, and we're planning on doing some of these in the future again (barring anything unforseen, changing of plans, etc.)",

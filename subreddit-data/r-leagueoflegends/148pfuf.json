    "postText": "So basically I am hardstuck low elo since like Season 2. I once been gold in Season 4 but other than that I always been silver. Sadly this season I cant even get out of bronze.  \n\n\nThe problem is the matchmaking seems like it is just a coinflip no matter how well or bad I am doing.  \nI feel completly pathetic since I played like 300 games this season and got 0 progress. Not even mentioning all those years. I feel like I am learning, I am getting at least slightly better, but that doesn't matter in the wider perspective. ATM I more feel like I am wasting electricity and time.  \n\n\nWhat do I do? How do I realistically climb? I feel completly hopeless at the moment like nothing that I try matters.",

Things will make more sense, you will remember how to do things and the muscle memory kicks in. Remember to mute chat. If you still develop bad habits, take a break again. If your life isn't healthy, unchallenging, or depresses you, it will affect your gameplay. Bronze is not hard, people just overcomplicate it, autopilot, or have shit mental. Like I said, take a break, just play 1-2 games per day.",

I was still playing with my poop when I was that age. You should be very proud of that. Don't worry, when your brain fully develops, you will improve at this game.",

RIOT is like starbucks at this point, only care about numbers and profit. \n\nOnly a balancing team that shifts the meta and skin designers who give us the same shitty pass we get every month.\n\nIt ain't worth it.",

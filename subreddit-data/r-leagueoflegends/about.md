Don't Address Individuals or Distinct Entities: This subreddit is here for users to communicate with each other and not just pass a message to an organization or individual without involving a major subset of the community. Posts must be made so that any user can participate in the discussion in a relevant manner. As such, you cannot directly address individuals, entities, or organizations in the entirety of posts made.

Feature Suggestions: Feature suggestions regarding what should or should not be in the game are allowed, provided they aren't directly addressing Riot or using titles leading to a "Yes, No" answer that can only be replied in an official manner by Riot. As such, using wording like "Can we have X" or similar is not allowed.

Feature suggestions must also be at least 250 characters in length.

Personal Stories: Personal stories must follow our relevancy rules and exceed 500 characters in length. Sob stories and rant posts are not allowed. "Rants" are defined as hyperbolic, acerbic, or otherwise inflammatory expressions of dissatisfaction.

Spoilers have to be tagged: Spoilers for the results of professional games are not allowed in titles for 24 hours following the match. Posts that contain spoilers in the body must have the spoiler tag.

In the case of Bo3/Bo5 games in a tournament setting the spoiler rule will be lifted on the next day when either team begins their next game.

Esports Content Restrictions: LEC, LCS, and major international event live discussion threads will be stickied automatically at the start of a game day.

The only two I remember are:  \n\n\nWelcome to WALLmart. Hey you dropped your WALLet! Is that a WALLrus (I remembered a third one)  \n\n\nI tried searching and I don't know if it's still up or not, but it was hilarious. If you know of this video and can find it, please let met know and gimme a link.  \n\n\nK thanks",

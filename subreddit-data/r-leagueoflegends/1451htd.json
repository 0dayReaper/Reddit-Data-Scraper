He was second only to Photic in 2021 and he put up similar numbers in 2021 compared to what Leave did in 2022 and in 2021 the LDL was a significantly stronger league before the U18 gaming ban in China.  \n\nHis team got caught matchfixning and 4 players got banned, he was investigated but found innocent (they would sub him out and throw games basically), eitherway that made it so he didn't play for a while so he might be a bit rusty. Interestingly his first ever split was in 2019 in the LMS on a completely dogshit team and even then it was clear that individually he was a cut above all the other ADCs in that region.  \n\nI've got no clue how old he is though.",

            "comment": "Hot take time: I'm actually more excited for TheSnake then Uzi.\n\n[TheSnake](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Thesnake) actually has a fascinating story. He's been the hard carry ADC for every single team he's been on. His [CS per Minute, Damage Per Minute and Damage % numbers](https://oracleselixir.com/player/Thesnake/statsBySplit) are ridiculous and has been on the All-Pro LDL teams consistently when he gets to start.\n\nAnd yet, he's never been picked up by any LPL org until EDG picked him out of the blue. He hasn't played pro league in a year. That's because every single team he's been on has been embroiled in matchfixing scandal. There were matchfixing issues with Alpha Esports, the LMS team he debuted with in 2019. Then he joined independent LDL team WanZhen Esports in 2021 Summer after their head coach was suspended for life for matchfixing and was clearly their star player, making the [2nd All Pro LDL team](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/LDL/2021_Season/Summer_Season/Results_Diagrams). Then when WZ became Team Orange for 2022 Spring, he was their best player there again and was named to the [1st All Pro LDL team](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/LDL/2022_Season/Spring_Season/Results_Diagrams). Both splits he was the main reason his team made the playoffs. He was then benched in 2022 Summer and then Team Orange was busted for matchfixing and was promptly kicked out entirely.\n\nWhile he was never directly caught matchfixing, the fact he's been adjacent to it his entire career was probably keeping most teams from picking him up. EDG picked him up just last month and likely only did so because they were desperately trying to find an academy ADC with Leave graduated to the main roster. In his most recent games with EDG.Y, he was actually playing support in an exhibition tournament just a week ago, probably a sign just how little EDG thought of the pickup.\n\nNow with Leave in the dog house and Uzi not yet officially announced, he's going to start for EDG against JDG and Ruler in his LPL debut. While Uzi is assuredly the plan once they get the contracts figured out, it's wild that this talented but troubled ADC goes from out of pro league to his LPL professional debut over the course of a month. This is movie script level stuff.",

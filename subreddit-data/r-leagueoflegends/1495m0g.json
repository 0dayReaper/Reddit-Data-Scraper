Always honor level 5, even got the Santa Baron and some others icons for being top 20% honorable before honor system was introduced. And I was always a bit chippy and toxic, yet I've never gotten a single ban/chat restriction, not once in 12 years. Come year 13, I've been repeatedly chat restricted, last thing typed were lyrics to a gay version of Slipknot's Psychosocial song, and for a whole month this time. I realize that previous years I was toxic only towards other people, Summoners if you will. But starting this year I went after the game itself and the way Riot is managing it. It's simple to blame your teammate for going 0/5, but /allchatting that his lane opponent is unhealthy for the game is the most I've chatted about. Riot is forcing different champions every patch, making them S tier, and one ban is simply not enough for the majority of matches. Their ranked system is flawed, it's always a coin flip for me as a support - I either get carried or they carry me, and it's always someone abusing the meta, or a higher ranked player smurfing the game. Stating the obvious here, but why come down on a simple player expressing this in a chatbox **in your game**? Why is it that this bothers them so much?  \n\n\nRiot wants to shut you up.",

Usually I start noticing shady shit between Plat2 and Plat1, and by the time I'm at Plat1 ~50LP every single game becomes utterly unplayable even though opponents aren't getting any better - if I'm supporting I'll stomp bot lane but top jg mid will get hard gapped and the ADC I invested into magically ceases to function past 15 minutes. Most of the time I'll get on a losing streak bringing me down to low-ish LP in Plat2 before I bounce back to a 70-80% win rate and break D4 and beyond.  \n  \nMy guess is a mix of tons of duo boosters, tons of duo boosted, tilted P1 players, gatekeeping D4 players who don't care and questionable matchmaking. P1-D4 games for me are more difficult than playing Smurf Q with a bunch of mental boomed ego Masters players.",

I am not just the main character I am the only character. \n\n2. Enemy champs are OP, all of them. When I do get a chance to play one a champ I believe to be OP my entire team refuse to listen to my instructions and use all of their bans on my counters. For this reason I end up in bad matchups and it\u2019s entirely the fault of my trolling team. \n\n3. The devs. I mean come on this one doesn\u2019t even explanation. Like we all know what I\u2019m taking about so I won\u2019t elaborate but clearly they have created and balanced the game in a way that just makes it better for everyone else except me. \n\n4. My isp, it knows right when I\u2019m about to get into a clutch fight and just chucks out some lag. I believe someone at the ISP hates me as I probably goomba stomped them in an ARAM at some point and I\u2019m assuming their still salty. \n\n5. My teammates just love to turbo int. sometimes they will do things like getting kills. Clearly the kill should have been left for me to secure because as mentioned previously I\u2019m the main character. Also they do things like not providing godly amounts of peel for me so I can walk into the enemy team 1vs5. Unplayable. \n\nSo yeah these are the reasons I\u2019m in iron and if you feel any of them apply to your situation feel free to use them.",

Sure I get a bit more LP while winning (when the LP gains are not fucked), but I still spend 50+ game with completely desynced rank and MMR which is stupid. \n\nIf promos are gone, just give us true MMR back already.",

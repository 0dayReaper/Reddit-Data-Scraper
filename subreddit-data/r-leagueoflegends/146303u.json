    "postText": "Does anyone else notice a difference in the quality and variance of games and teammates on week days vs weekends?\n\n I feel like I climb during the week and go on a big losing streak every weekend. I play jungle, and week day teammates seem to group better at objectives and generally feed less. Weekends seem more likely to have 0/4 top lane at 10 mins, or a bot lane that is fighting each other by the time first dragon arrives. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps more people can play on the weekends, so the player base broadens and there is more variance? Idk, anyone have similar or opposite experiences?",

Someone else pointed out it could just be people tilting from playing too many games (or possibly autopilot from playing too long without breaks).",

Weekends may be volatile.\n\nTo me early in the day are assasins and skirmishers hours. Games tend to be volatile.\n\n17pm and later are mage and late game champions hours. Scaling is stronger.\n\nAll this in low elo tho.",

Oh and Skarner trailer would have dropped in 2 months\n\n\nNow they have pretty much slowed down release of champs, it took them like 140+ days to release KSante, 120+ days to release Milio and Naafiri is releasing ~100 days after Milio. So approximately a year to release 3 new champs.\n\nSo chances are Briar will come out around worlds(in a similar manner to KSante) while Ink Mage and cute Creature adc come out 2024",

For all the shit that Sentinels of Light got, it at least guaranteed 4 champs came out in 2021 (Viego, Gwen, Vex, and Akshan).\n\nReworks apparently take an entire year minimum based on Asol and now Skarner, so they're not being pumped out quick.\n\nI guess the focus by Riot is on kit updates like Neeko/Rell? But Rell took 5 months to come out (Was announced in January), and afaik, Neeko was the last kit update announced. So unless Riot has some unannounced updates in the works (And Lee Sin + Teemo's ASU don't count, because they don't change gameplay), then it seems like there's just... no new gameplay on the horizon.\n\nHopefully the first new game mode they've made in 2 years is fun?",

At least with someone like fiddle or galio they knew what the themes were and amplified it.

A good Rehgar won't run out of mana, ever.\n\nThe thing is that his totem is not that tough to destroy, and his totem build only ever really works against melee assassins or someone like Diablo w/ AA build I guess. Never found it very useful against spellcasters.\n\nHOWEVER. Rehgar with totem is at weakest pre-7, okay 7-15, and becomes insanely strong with 16+. Because of totem talent. It gives him waveclear, insane sticking power, very fast camp clearing and overall insane utility. All of this + cleanse since lvl1. Plus Ancestral or its upgrade (with certain teammates like Diablo) can enable some insane plays, which makes his team very hard to shut down, but his other 20 talents are also very good.\n\nBut before 16, he's not that strong.\n\nProblem with Rehgar is that he CAN be played by just sitting in the back pressing two-three buttons. I hate players like these and I despise everyone who does it because it's not fun for anyone involved.\n\nI play Rehgar diving in and out constantly and saving my ass with clutch healing and movespeed from Wolf form. That's what makes him fun. But I mean, once again, I also play Garrosh, and I play them both for one reason - (besides them being orcs) they both can play being deep into enemies and survive a long while on low HP while being a complete menace to shut down. (Yes i was a Zul'jin main before as well, he just got too repetitive for me.)",

Then we have gotten Nilah and Renata that are super unpopular.

I am okay if they scale up the reworks and only do 1-2 champions per year because for me, even a successful rework feels like a new champion BUT\n\nEvercore heroes is coming out soon, watched their trailer with the chef support which feels super thematic and interesting. Theorycraft gaming is creating a new game with pretty original ideas. Even just thinking about some of the already existing MOBA games there are plenty of pretty unique and fun heroes that can be created. Or even just check overwatch, Ana is one of the best example of a simple and popular, yet skillful design with a smart twist.\n\nThere are plenty of possibility that can still exist but I just hope that the new champions are actually creative instead of having another boring enchanter support who feels like yuumi, nami and soraka together. \n\nAnd actually I think this is the biggest issue. Samira was revolutionary and unique. Nilah feels like a homework which was just copied (it is especially interesting considering their designers). Milio is a really good champion to learn support, I think he fills the role mich better than Yuumi, on the other hand, he feels really like other enchanters to me. Bel'veth almost hit the mark but she feels too slappy for me and eventually just a Master Yi light with a little more utility. She could be so much more based on her theme. I know people complain a lot because of Zeri but she feels unique and fun. Same goes for Renata Glasc. Even Yuumi is an interesting concept and I am the minority since I believe that I don't mind her main mechanic just they should shift her more to the side where she has to take risks (and deattach). \n\nTLDR: I want unique champions there are plenty of room for creativity.",

The majority of the last releases have been extremely filler-like and recycled abilities with toxic/bland/non-interactionable/nonsensical designs.\n\nToxic: Bel'Veth plays nearly 1:1 to the outdated season 1 design of Yi, you just basic attack the enemy, next to 0 mechanics or skill expression. If you're a melee against her, you lose 90% of the time by default to no-counterplay stat-check. Can't believe this is a \"modern\" release in 2022, what a joke.\n\nRecycled: Nilah to Samira and Seraphine to Sona. No need to elaborate here, it's all self explanatory. Their existence makes no sense and League could've been the same without them.\n\nFiller/Bland: Vex brings nothing new to the table. Gameplay resumes to \"See enemy -&gt; Press ability -&gt; Do damage\" and there's already enough mages that do exactly this. The anti-dash mechanic that makes her somewhat stand out happens by itself so it's not like you have to put any effort into it. Only the dash reset brings something interesting on a mage.\n\nNonsensical: I don't understand how a champion as heavy and bulky as K'Sante can dash as smooth as assassins multiple times in a fight and drag you with him over walls for dozens of meters. The gameplay doesn't match the champion itself at all, it's as ridiculous as if Mordekaiser could dash like he does. Also, his weapons face backwards... how in God's name is that supposed to make sense I really can't tell. How does he hit the enemy? It's so counter-intuitive. \n\nNon-interactionable: Qiyana perma-stuns you and one-shots you the moment she lays the slightest touch on you. If you're somehow tanky enough to survive it, then she will just spam green Q and stay invisible 90% of the time while chunking you on each Q cast. There's no way to respond to her in combat, the only way to fight her is to not fight her. It's a champion you can't interact with, she needed to be reworked from day 1.\n\nOther honorable mentions are Yuumi and Zeri. They're so absurd that if they were deleted tomorrow, no sane soul would complain about it. Most new champions just make the game worse and worse each time, nearly every addition is only meaningful when absurdly broken, because that's what it takes to compensate for the lack of good and depthful gameplay+theme design.\n\nI'd rather want to see VGUs and reworks instead of forced champion releases for now.\n\nJust my opinion.",

Zeri doesn't bring much dmg she's just hard to kill/catch, which is actually good if she is against a feed assassin or a tank she won't be killing them and most times will die or force summoners to escape",

The game clearly needs some sort of refresh to make the experience smoother. Whether it be a working client, fixing spaghetti code, making new ideas for champs possible with a stronger base game, or the ability to more easily add additional content to the game like new maps and new champions or items.

We could have 300 champs one day, but if the balancing isn't proper then you can end up in a scenario where only like 30 are mainly played. How many older champs deserve a rework? Also, more champions probably makes balancing the game harder.\n\nTo be fair, stale meta isn't totally the balance team's fault though because when LS interviewed balance devs they discussed how pros don't always play the best champs at the moment. Sometimes they even give like placebo buffs to a champ just to signal to players it is strong. Ultimately, Riot will likely continue to release new champions that are strong because that is sort of their business model. I do wonder if slowing down champ releases isn't for lack of idea, but because with every new release it on average pushes the past new releases down a peg on the OP meter. Which probably lowers skin sales.",

In addition, it makes it harder to balance items, as well as other champions, which lowers competitive integrity over time. Finally, each new champ release devalues bans, which have already been too low for a long time, while Riot refuses to increase the number of bans.\n\nWhile it might suck to some people to hear something like this, that's the reality, and part of why Riot decided to slow down on champion releases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nASUs and VGUs should be accelerated instead, and down the road focusing champions along certain powercurves/niches to give actual reasons to pick a champ when they aren't the strongest in their role. \n\nRiot can do content in ways that aren't just champion releases and skin lines, even if nobody seems to realize that.

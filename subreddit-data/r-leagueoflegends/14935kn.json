It is still fine but yeah those moments can be crucial if We make it to international stage.\n\nThanatos would have been fine if DK had put him into the main team at the beginning of the year or before the playoff last Split. Because then he could have time to improve and adapt to team. But I hope regardless How far we make this year next year Thanatos could be the starter. Dude is so big for Challenger.",

Our biggest strength in the past was having all winning lanes and building small leads from each to have like extra 2k ahead of the enemy team while Canton running around do whatever he wants and enemy team couldn\u2019t contest because they are already pushed under turret or losing and then force them to a skirmish and win it there. Now I don\u2019t feel like we are doing that. That\u2019s maybe what Daeny was bringing I don\u2019t know but I really liked some shit Daeny was doing and I was actually against him leaving. Because despite his quirks he was offering a lot to team. We could have him as a strategic coach or sth.\n\nSo Maybe better drafting would help but that also could be because some of our players don\u2019t have huge champion pool? I mean Smaker and Canyon has a huge pool and Dett as well but not sure about Kellin and Canna though.",

The team is just in limbo waiting for Showmaker to become consistent again and for the meta to change so Kellin can play more playmaking supports.

Who knows; Renekton could be a top pick again and they can play more towards Canna and help with the issue of being essentially a one threat team.",

At this point Juhan has to be fucking the GM\u2019s mom or something, whenever he steps off the bench he\u2019s been very serviceable (even last year with the whole Pyosik situation), yet they *never* started him until Play-ins, for 1 game.

Croco was often ganking a lot early on, with his team setting it up for him, especially on botside where prince was. That's why they caught a lot of teams surprised with their aggressive plays and managed to get a lot of resources early on, and snowballing it with prince as carry. Although later on, especially in playoffs, other teams adapted to them and make counter plays to their aggressive plays.",

League of Legends and six other esports titles will be featured as medal events for the first time. The shift will accommodate our LoL Esports pro players competing in the Asian Games.",

Let's do European games that start a week later and end a week later and NA games that start a week after the European games and end a week after that and watch Riot not delay worlds for those two.\n\nAs they shouldn't. If someone has \"more important\" things to do they can't come, as simple as that.",

                    "comment": "I will give you the benefit of the doubt because the grammar of the original post is a bit misleading and should be \"Worlds are delayed according to Doinb because of *the Asian Games*\". But he is referring to the 2022 Asian Games (which were delayed to 2023 due to COVID), that has esports as a part of their list of sports that they are playing for medals and LoL as a part of their list of esports being played. They are not referring simply to the games happening in the pro scenes in Asia. The 2018 Asian Games had esports as a part of their list of demonstration sports for medals and they decided to have esports be a part of the main set of sports this time since there was enough interest. So, it is not like this is a completely new development. Meanwhile, the 2023 European Games start on June 21st and the 2023 Pan American Games start on October 20th and neither have esports as a part of their list of sports being played for medals. If you want to campaign to have esports and LoL be a part of their games, be my guest. I am sure there is a big enough fan base across at least LoL, Valorant, CS:GO, and etc. for those regions.",

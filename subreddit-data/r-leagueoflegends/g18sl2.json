    "postText": "Hey all, \n\nSo I will try to keep this anonymous as possible, though it's quite hard given my current situation. I've been playing League of Legends for 6 years under the alias Squid Corona - squids are my favourite animal and Corona, believe it or not, is my real life surname. \n\nAs I'm sure everyone is well aware, there is a global pandemic called COVID-19 or, as very inconveniently for me, better known as Coronavirus. Trust me, I've heard all the jokes possible from friends and co-workers. \n\nAt the start of 2019 I managed to change my in-game name to just \"Corona\" as I thought the shorter version of my name was nicer, worked well with telling my real life friends to add me on League, as they all know it's my surname and I think Corona is a cool name so why not have just that. I had to use one of those third party sites to check the name and stay up till midnight in order to secure my family name in League (as a side note, Riot should really consider implementing a bot-detect system to stop name sniping).\n\nI'm by most descriptions a casual player - I play one or two games a day of normal draft pick, almost always with friends just as a way of relaxing after work. On the 1st of April, I try to login to be greeted with a message telling me I need to change my name in order to proceed. I thought it was amusing at first, as almost every game a player would say in chat \"nice name\" to me, but I just shrugged my shoulders and emailed Riot in the hopes of them agreeing that it was a funny situation, and my name would be white-listed. \n\nAfter two weeks of back and forth with multiple \"Player Support Specialists\", I was told that they had come to the conclusion that my name would not get white-listed and that I would have to change it if I wanted to keep playing League of Legends. **This is specially stupid since in other regions, players with the name Corona are still active and playing.**\n\nThis to me is all very disappointing. I haven't chosen the name \"Corona\" for any reason, and certainly haven't done it during the covid-19 outbreak. I feel like Riot are just sticking a big middle finger to me and telling me that my family name is inappropriate to be a part of their game. I'm posting this to reddit because I want to know if the community really feels offended by the summoner name \"Corona\", or if I'm right in feeling a mild rage and sense of unfairness.\n\nEDIT: here's proof of communication: https://imgur.com/a/OE9l8sc\nProof of ID has also been privately sent.\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks for the pressure reddit, Riot has given me my account back!",

Please keep in mind that we will not be accepting player reports for the foreseeable future. If you have any other inquiries we can assist with, don\u2019t hesitate to open a new ticket and we will be happy to help.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to make a post on this sub - warning people that CURRENTLY the only way they can punish hostage takers is to actually go through with the game and use the report feature at the end. It immediately got taken down by the mods...\n\nI'm glad that making this guy change his name is considered a critical issue instead.",

None of them were responsible for determining the outcome of the decision, just the one manager/manager team.\n\nCactopus sees the post, discusses it with other Rioters in HQ, and they determine that the name change does not line up with their original intentions when they were writing the rules for their support teams. I'd conjecture that a new exception will be written for support staff about allowing long standing names related to unexpected world events.",

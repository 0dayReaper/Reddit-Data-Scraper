    "postText": "A year has passed and we're basically back to everyone getting oneshot after 25 minutes. Has durability patch improved anything? At the very beginning yes.\n\n# Who profited from durability patch?\n\nWe can all agree that nowadays, except the borderline examples, **games depend mostly on bot lane**. Why is that? If you check lol wiki, you can see that for the past year most **adcs were getting damage and armor pen buffs** and there were **barely any nerfs before the new items** changes. Not only did they get beefier, often making them as tanky as 2 items tank champions due to the durability patch and their lifesteal, they also got a whole **new item kit**, **better support items** that increase their survivability, **they kept their dash item** (despite them no longer being squishy and having a movement skill 90% of the time) and **they profit the most from the new buff changes** (red and blue are most useful on adcs and thus often given to them).\n\nWhat about other lanes? Let's ignore 13.11 for now, since it requires polish. **Jungle is dominated by one shot champions** that can and **will easily kill you with their full combo**, making basically no difference from time pre-durability patch. The only way you can hope to survive eve's full combo is if you go full tank or exhaust and even then, she will just finish you off in the next 2-3 seconds.\n\nBefore riot removed prowler, which **shifted mid meta more towards cc/supporting champions** (guess for which lane), it was also **heavily contested by either aoe cc** champions (they will always be useful) **OR your typical oneshotters** with OG mages/midlaners being pushed to 50% or below win rate. What does that tell us? That **meta heavily benefitted the champions that were supposed to be more balanced by durability patch**.\n\nLet's move to my personal favourite and **generally considered the worst lane - top**. Probably the only champions that really got balanced are top laners. **We no longer see unkillable sions, dominating fioras or tanks that deal assassin damage**. What do we see then? If you scroll through biggest win rate top champions **for the past year**, you will see that excluding poppy and riven, **there are barely any OG top laners** **that can get into best 10-15**. Most of the time those **spots are occupied by rengar, adcs or rogue mages**. Top laners can't match adcs damage, they can't splitpush like they used to due to decreased mobility and new minion changes. They also are average as tanks since your typical adc will melt them in 2-3 seconds thanks to the previously mentioned damage and armor pen buffs and new items. For the lane that's easiest to lose, **they have no significant impact** in games where they win. **The best thing a top laner can do this season is to be a frontline meat shield for his adc.**\n\n# Who REALLY got nerfed by durability patch?\n\nLet's move onto who got hurt by durability patch. It's easy to draw conclusions from the previous part. **Most of your standard mages became absolutely useless and are barely played.** When was the last time you've seen Viktor, Ryze, LB, Akali, Veigar, Corki or any mid champion that isn't a oneshotter/aoe cc? You probably saw them like 2-3 times this season. They don't really benefit much from durability patch and they got **no significant changes that could make them as useful as supporting cc for your adc or burst champions like Zoe** (and her new 30% mr pen), Cassio, Neeko or cc spammers like Gragas and Ahri.\n\n**How often do you see bruisers in jungle**? We can accept that mages stopped jungling, since it makes sense, but bruiser/tanks? Their toolkit was usually well suited for being a jungler, but for the past 2 years **they're basically a budget champion** when your jungler's mains aren't available. Their **tankiness**, as we already said, is **useless**, **ccs** are just **okay for ganks** and not really helpful later and their **damage just isn't up to par**. Does it make them well-rounded? I wish. It makes them **unwanted and useless**. Every champion has average damage now with adc and some champions being absolute nukes. New **supports are overloaded with peel/cc** skills and your mid or top are often forced to have aoe cc. **You** also **can't really tank**, since enemy **adc with their hyper mobility will just shred you**. You **become just a filler** that can hope to find it's use. Unless you play oneshotters or Kindred, of course. Nunu, Maokai, Zac, Rammus, WW and many others became just situational picks. If you blind pick them, you're most likely gonna get fucked.\n\n**A lot of top laners were forced to either migrate to mid lane or become your second support.** The list of champions that got ground to shit here is too long for me to even start naming them. **For every OG top lane champion above 50%wr, there are usually 3 that are below.** The only **top lane champions that are consistently doing alright since durability patch** are Poppy (huge damage, useful peel, cc, tankiness, a really well rounded champion), Singed (no longer as a top laner, but a second support), **oneshotters** like Olaf and Riven, absolutely **unbalanced Ornn** that kept his assassin-like damage, huge tankiness and gives like 5-6k gold advantage in stats to your team, **aoe cc unbalanced Malphite** and rare bruisers like Jax or Kled. That gives us 8 top laners that can play top lane.\n\n# How do we fix it?\n\nIt seems like **pre-durability patch lol is just the default state of the game**. Sucks that we had to butcher a lot of champions to make us realize that. We also had to directly or indirectly buff the champions that caused the durability patch in the first place. **Jungle has to give 80% of it's focus to bot, top is useless, mid has to roam (preferrably bot) or just fall behind**. Top lane champions can't even hope to try to focus adcs now, since they removed prowler dash and your average adc will just now dash away with gale force, with their movement skill, with their flash (and sometimes ghost) and then additionally get peeled. **ADCs became untouchable**.\n\n**Most we could probably hope for is percentage stats on items, tp being unleashed from the beginning of the game and hopefully changed formulas that calculated damage reduction from stats.**\n\n\\- Adding percentage stats on items would probably help limit some insane builds that pop up here and there (like adcs running around with hydras and randuins) and increase their usefulness on champions they were meant for.\n\n\\- Also, since Riot is committed to classifying champions, the stat formulas should be different depending on the class the champion belongs to. Prolonged fights would help some of the now obsolete mages come back to meta.\n\n\\- Unleashing tp from the first minute would at least increase mid/top impact on the game, making it less dependent on adc's damage.\n\n//Edit: Also maybe increase jungle camps damage, since we now have pets to help them. It would limit some typical assassins from heavily dominating jungle.\n\n//Edit2: Introduce something like dragon to top side or make herald give a decent gold to the whole team, so jungle at least has an objective that would require it to pay attention to top side of the map. Herald rarely has a big enough impact on the game to focus on it. Maybe those krugs will finally stop being left behind.\n\n**The issue went too far for it to have any fast and direct solutions.**",

This durability patch was biased af because it gave the same amount of resistances to people that build a lot of it, and to people who dont. As a result adcs got like 30% tankier while tanks and bruisers barely at all.\n\nPre durability patch was an aboslute shitshow of a meta where everyone got oneshot left and right. For some reason adcs were still meta cause they were egregiously buffed over time to compensate the fact they got dirtily oneshot and prolly felt shit to play.\n\nWhen I see adcs dominate with shit like titanic, i dont think the problem comes from items like that. I dont see how nerfing an item thats barely that good on bruisers who should want this item makes sense. Maybe its time to realize the base numbers and kit scalings of adcs are fucked and need nerfs, not itemization. Adcs have always been meta and strong even when they felt weak because they function on lower exp economy and are naturally powerful by class design.\n\nAnd also do a real durability patch, like nerf all the disgustingly high %health, %pen running rampant and damage accross the board, instead of doing a \"buff to defense\" for placebo purposes, even if people like when things are buffed and dislike when things are nerfed.\n(Cause adcs arent at all the only problem here, by far)\n\nAnd create real powerful defensive items (tbh just nerfing melting in general would probably do that). A carry should feel super strong when they have 3/4 offensive items and a fat pure defensive item. Thats way healthier than a meta where they build either full damage or a mix of mobility/health/damage (cause they already have a decent bunch of resistances to deal with flat damage and having more is kinda worthless when you face items/champs designed to destroy tankiness) I feel that items giving mixed offense/defense or offense/mobility have notoriously been problematic so they should be limited.",

What? \n\nIt is tank meta and top lane tanks have been the strongest they ever been because they have high base stats and do absurd amounts of damage without dedicated damage items. You tell me what the hell an Ezreal can do against a Hullbreaker Heartsteel Sion with like 6k HP at 30 minutes.\n\nADCs, even when fed, straight up get stat checked by top laners. Only on-hit ADCs build BorK can match up well, and most ADCs don't build armor pen until 4th item, so that literally means that everything but an engage support can just shit on them for a good duration of the game. \n\nTanks are so absurdly overpowered that the only reason it's considered bot Meta is because only the ADCs can reliably kill them as the game goes on so junglers should want to camp bottom. Assassins can't kill tanks. Mages cant. It's so ridiculous that you will find people playing Tanks in the mid lane and they just effectively neuter 90% of mid-laners and counterplay isn't really involved.\n\nThe Jungle isn't decided by one shot champions, but Jungle has the biggest influence its ever had with how gank-heavy and snowbally the game is. An ADC can fall behind and farm to get back into the game. Bullshit champions like Yone, Kat, and Yasuo, only need a few kills to get back into the game. But when a Jungler gets outjungled, falls behind, that has such massive severe impacts on all 3 lanes.\n\nTop laners have plenty of influence on the map, only after 10 minutes. It's all dependent on how well they use TP or how braindead you splitpush with Hullbreaker on Sion or Yorick.\n\nNow is the game League of One Shot? Yes. Because Bruisers and Tanks can 1 shot you too.",

                    "comment": "I think the biggest problem with changes after the durability patch was that Riot didn't learn anything and just kept upscaling the numbers. Instead of thinking that them consistently balancing everything upwards led to durability patch being a neccessity, they still keep moving average stats higher and higher to balance the new changes. One of the causes is simply the amount of champions in the game. You can't balance everyone out. Some of them would remain obsolete until reworked, but is that a bad thing? Wouldn't adjusting the game to an optimal state and reworking champions that don't fit that state be better than pushing out new champions?",

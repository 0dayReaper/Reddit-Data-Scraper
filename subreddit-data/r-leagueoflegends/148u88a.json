The issue is that he's only really Master elo or lower, which means his coaching isn't useful to anyone above diamond or so. There are a lot of coaches who offer low elo coaching, most of whom charge much less than $350/hour (or whatever his fee is) and some of which are definitely better coaches. Even high-elo coaches like VeigarV2 charge less than half what he does - and VeigarV2 is an actual challenger player and professional coach for C9.\n\nI often find Neace unbearable as a personality though, and his chronic tilt in Korea definitely didn't help that.",

Some people are lost and just need to get told what to do, while some people are hardstuck because of shitty, wrong habits, some people overthink and can't be forced to think any other way so they should take a break. I'm not sure what your standards are when it comes to a 'good' coach. But I can definitely imagine what a good League coach looks like, someone who makes a schedule to check in with students every once in a while, cares about coaching, tries to ask questions, doesn't judge and assertive about mistakes to improve. It's a bit like talk therapy, you're being asked questions and shown how to approach thinking about them in a rational way to hopefully reduce negative thinking patterns.",

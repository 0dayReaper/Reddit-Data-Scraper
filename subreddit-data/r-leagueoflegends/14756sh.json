    "postText": "Today I was thinking about a way to decide which skin, from the ones i liked, to purchase next. And I was wishing there was a tab inside the shop I could access of only of the skins, icons, chromas, etc. that I liked and added on my wishlist. Think it could be very useful, and even have the players be notified when a temporary skin they have on their wishlist is available again (speaking corporate for them to se they will get money cash if this were an idea they liked lol).\n\n\\*Also maybe friends could have access to them to see what you liked and purchase, just another suggestion :3",

They can see what types of items you are considering, and then push you to buy based on that data. They can see how often you view or come back to those items. They can see if you have several similar items stored.\n\nThey can then use all of this data to push you to make a purchase. Maybe you get an email, an in client notification, a special discount, \u201cyour store\u201d gets curated, etc. They can send a notification to people on your friend list, saying: \u201chey an item your friend has in their wishlist is on sale right now, act now!\u201d\n\nIf you want to hand Riot even more tools to extract money out of you by playing on your psychology\u2014go for it.\n\nSkins are already predatory, and OP is asking Riot to make it easier to pimp them out even more.\n\nIt\u2019s depressing.",

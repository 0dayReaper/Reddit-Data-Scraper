    "postText": "I have been trying different boots to see how much they impact my play.\n\nI tried ninja tabi and mercury thought they were good for what they are but I sometimes struggle to manage my pacing. I would like to roam and ward but sometimes I am too slow to get to the nearest fight when I am slightly far away and could not assist in time. I don\u2019t feel extra tanky either from the boots as I died most of the time when I engaged and got focused.\n\nI like to roam a bit as a support and be able to get to the fight as soon as possible so I wonder if boots or mobility is the better choice? I main nautilus so a landed hook usually mean I am not getting out of the fight anyway so might as well make sure I am in the fight at the right time and provide CC. I tried boots of swiftness but they are still kinda slow for my taste. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Combat stats like merc treads or steelcaps are a good idea. The other is a farm lane where you're against lulu/janna/soraka and your goal is to give your adc as much solo xp as possible and you should be running mid/top as much as possible but you still want to be at least near bot lane when waves are crashing so they don't 3v1 your adc under tower. You need mobis to consistently roam quickly enough. \n\nSwifties are useless. Once you've landed q or r your ms doesn't matter any more. Mobis will help you run someone down so you can guarantee your q",

Also if you're not at least mid gold in rank, the opposing adc isn't going to control the wave well enough to give you time to go top and the more time you spend out of lane the more likely it is your adc will die \n\nIf your adc is an early game adc and they fall behind ots probably best to just leave them to die but if you have a hard scaling adc and the player isn't absolute ass then it's probably worth it to just play body guard while they farm and prevent fights with your presence",

Blitz wants those too. Naut wants mobis. \n\nYou aren\u2019t meant to be a frontline tank, you\u2019re engage or peel. Going mobis means you can roam and snowball the map super easily.\n\nImo the best first backs you could get on naut are the 1050 gold tank/melee support component (the hp/haste one, can\u2019t remember the name) OR mobis for 1000. Essentially you decide if you want to commit to lane kingdom and rush evenshroud or locket, or if you want to roam and snowball.\n\nI always go mobis first back if my lane is some passive shit that will never have anything happen (think like ezreal naut vs jinx Janna or some shit). Jinx Janna isn\u2019t gonna dive an ezreal. And you can\u2019t do anything into a Janna. \n\nSo you go mobis. Get vision for midlane, help them shove, then you either invade with mid jungle, or dive somewhere.\n\nAlso, a mark of a good nautilus is one that either lands a hook that *wins* the fight (even if the naut dies), or a nautilus that can hook in without going so deep that you can\u2019t survive at all.\n\nSwifty boots are only if you\u2019re REALLY fucked by slows, like zilean, anivia, whatever ya know? They\u2019re not nearly as fast as mobis, but if it\u2019s really that rough of a game of slows, I can see them justified.\n\nEither way, mobis is king for nautilus, it is BY FAR the best boots for him. If you *really* want to, say if your whole topside is winning hard, you could just go mercs or tabis and just play for lane. But you kneecap your map pressure for the rest of the game by lacking that movement speed. \n\nBesides, later into the game, your beefiness gets outscaled pretty hard, so you shouldn\u2019t even really be looking to be tanky. And early game, you\u2019re beefy enough that the extra tankiness isnt necessary. So you really just want to roam all over the map and snowball where necessary. Mobis are simply the best for that.\n\nLook up Coach Cupcake on YT, he\u2019s a former pro support player, played for a wildcard region at msi and worlds 2018, really insane support player. Has a lot of info to offer on his yt channel about good builds, runes, playstyles, etc. He\u2019s also a smaller yt\u2019er, so it\u2019s not hard to get a response from him in the comments of his more recent videos.\n\n-A naut main.",

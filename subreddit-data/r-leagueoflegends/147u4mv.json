    "postText": " \n\nI'll go out and say it: Yuumi is balanced. Oppressive paired with certain ADCs like Zeri or Twitch? Absolutely. However Yuumi herself is in a very good state for pro and casual play.\n\nBefore you come out and scream for my head, hear my thoughts. Yes, Yuumi is currently at a 100% participation rate in LCK after Week 1. However, Yuumi is also currently at a 33% winrate across a large sample size, even being a part of losing team compositions for teams that normally should have won their matchup (see: DRX vs Dplus Kia Game 2, DRX won as underdogs, against Yuumi).\n\nYuumi's strength is empowering an ADC that is extremely mobile and that positions aggressively, that other enchanters would not be able to support. Her solo queue winrates support this: her top duo adcs are Nilah, Zeri, Tristana and Twitch. Her LCK winrate also supports this, she has been picked with Zeri 7 times, and won 3. She has been picked with Twitch once, and won. Tristana and Nilah haven't been paired with her yet in LCK.\n\nThat gives Yuumi a 50% winrate when paired with an optimal duo adc. That's pretty balanced, stats wise. However, without Twitch or Zeri, Yuumi's winrate plummets to 20%, across 10 games played in LCK. That is also balanced stats wise, since she is being picked with ADCs that are not optimal for her kit, meaning she should be at a disadvantage.\n\nLet's take a look at another statistic: Zeri. We all know Zeri is getting destroyed next patch, but it's still relevant here. Zeri was Yuumi's best frequent ADC pairing in LCK so far. Zeri's winrate with, or without Yuumi is at an insane 61%. A super nerfed Zeri will likely reduce Yuumi's pro presence, unless pros switch to more Nilah or Twitch.\n\nIn Solo Queue, Yuumi's winrate is currently as of writing this, at 50.17% currently at [u.gg](https://u.gg/). Annie's is at 51.67%, Amumu's is at 49.54%, Malphite's is at 51.78%, Miss Fortune's is at 51.46% and Garen's is at 50.48%. That's actually pretty good in comparison to those other beginner friendly champions. She is also scheduled for a minor nerf in the next patch.\n\nNow that we've found Yuumi to be relatively balanced for pro play and soloqueue, let's tackle the other polarizing opinion on Yuumi: her skill expression.\n\nYes, Yuumi has a very low skill floor. However her skill ceiling is also relatively high compared to other supports. Her Q is a lot harder to hit and is more powerful early game. This makes or breaks her laning phase, versus her just being detached and auto attacking for poke instead. Bad Yuumis miss her Q frequently in lane, making her become useless in lane.\n\nShe also does not get infinite mana like before. With Presence of Mind and Manaflow Band, it is crucial she hits her Qs in lane. See the trend of skill expression here?\n\nA Milio can miss every Q, not E Harass, and still be useful in lane due to his high shielding and healing. Janna can miss every ability, not harass, and just stay back and peel if there's an engage with her Tornado. A Yuumi can do nothing but shield her ADC and give them very low lifesteal.\n\nYuumi also has another huge weakness. Her roaming power is very low. While not on her best friend, she is barely a champion. This gives a huge advantage to the opposing support, allowing them to roam to other lanes, pressure Herald, get vision, etcetera. Yuumi also lacks the aggression in her kit to engage on the solo adc when the opposing support roams.\n\nIn regards to the \"Beginner Champions should not see Pro Play\" crowd. I couldn't disagree more. Beginner champions in professional play does not mean they are overpowered. Garen is seeing lots of action right now in the NACL and is getting very high praise. Annie has a very high participation rate across all regions right now and is not getting any hate.\n\nBeginner champions being in pro play is **good** for Riot. New players to League of Legends will see them being played and be happy to know they can pick up those champions with ease, and maybe even figure out some of their professional strategies to boost their LoL skill quicker.\n\nIt also provides good contrast to viewers. A Garen in a teamfight is a lot easier to keep track of than an Akali, and allows the match to highlight the Akali's skill and combos easier without more visual clutter.\n\n**TL;DR:** Stats show that Yuumi is balanced in both professional and casual play. Her winrate and pickrate are inflated due to Zeri being overpowered, who is scheduled for major nerfs, alongside Yuumi who is scheduled for minor nerfs. This will put her in a very healthy state for all modes of play.\n\nI know this is a hot topic. Please don't downvote because of rage after you lose to Yuumi in SoloQ. Take the time to read the stats, and make an educated opinion. I'd love to have more discussion about this with you all.",

Champ is insane but surely taking a bit of passive damage (from the lowest damage support) and a bit of armor (from one of the safest supports) will make him balanced.",

Basically the whole playerbase is hating on Yuumi (for a good reason).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI gave Yuumi a chance after the rework, I played a couple of games with her but she is even more uninteractive than before. She has no benefit from ever unattaching from her ADC unless it's a very bad player and she wants to 24/7 sit on her Jungler/Toplane. I played 3 games with the new Yuumi and it was the most boring experience in the past months when I played League. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently, I'm just dodging lobbies (especially when I picked an Enchanter/Mage) when I see the enemy picking Yuumi simply because I don't want to 15 minutes do nothing until lane ends. League is a game and I'm playing it for fun. Why am I forced to dodge games when facing an anti-fun champ? Why should I be forced to waste my time and watch Yuumi meming on me with her Emotes just because she picked a braindead champ? I refuse - and I'm certain that most people feel the same way about her....",

Reddit is an echo chamber, keep in mind. Her pick rate wouldn't be so high either if people didn't enjoy the champion. \n\nUnattaching from the ADC is crucial for wave management and for warding. \n\nYou can absolutely do things in lane vs Yuumi other than wait until lane ends. You can pick Senna and perma push/farm stacks. You can pick Blitzcrank and roam. Those are just a couple options.",

I don't know where you got that from but Lux is basically a walking caster minion since she can't do anything in lane vs Yuumi. I can say that because I just recently played a game on my gold smurf as Lux vs a hardstuck Yuumi and I guess she just was the better player. Pressing her shield and stuff you know. Things that really good players who have 200+ games in gold usually do.",

Warwick not having aoe clear makes his group camp clear speed a downside but it\u2019s not a vulnerability as he can still do it. She is untargetable for the majority of the game, that means all aoe damage in lane that usually hits both enemy champs doesn\u2019t affect her. You can\u2019t force her out of lane before her ADC like you can with all other supps cause you can\u2019t hit her.",

Not only are sample sizes small (like you need thousands of games to make a conclusion that breaks through other variables such as team strength), but also there is a lot more focus on draft priority. If you pick Yuumi in solo q it won't really affect opposition picks. However, in LCK you will never get Yuumi without the other team picking a number of other priority picks (which are also 'op'). \n\nThis is why Riot's balance framework doesn't care about winrate when it comes to pro play but Pick/Ban presence, because it relies on the assumption that pro teams will just pick what's the most optimal.",

Even with 30 games it basically makes no sense\n\nWhy? Because some teams would win regardless of the champions that were played. And other teams would lose in the same way. This effect is countered by having immense sample sizes but we dont have that.\n\nYou adressed that yuumi is good with zeri which is a fair point but to then adress all of that power to zeri without any stats to back it up is bias and hasnt got any reasoning. What is zeri her trackrecord? \n\nYou have to take all stats with a grain of salt and alot of side notes. Maybe alot of them arent relevant but there can be many things backing the statement.\n\nComfort, draft priority, enemy trying to counter it or not. What was the reason behind the losses and the wins. \n\nIf every game yuumi was picked had a pentakill with yuumi on top of the champion in question but would lose all games. Would yuumi be strong or would she be weak because of her winrate? \n\nI know Im nitpicking but you have to criticise the data more. Why are certain games relevant to your stats, why are some not. \n\nAnother thing is, do People play counters into yuumi, what counters yuumi. If you always pick yuumi as a counterpick on 4/5 she should be having a higher winrate theoretically than if she was a blind first pick. (55-60% VS  40-45% in pro play) because she could technically be counterpicked by 5 champions.",

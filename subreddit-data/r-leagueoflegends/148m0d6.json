The Heal and Shield Power now being based on the spell rank, rather than ally level, make a W max second a viable option in Patch 13.12",

Zyra, lux, seraphine, shaco,pyke, ect...Maybe you had a fight and your adc dies and gets a double. A good support will make sure the wave isn't in a shit spot and shove to tower if you have the time/jungle is elsewhere. Maybe you roam to help with rift or to mid and they die. Boom more cs for me bitch. Covering a push for a backed laner is free cs for me.  \n\nLategame finding opportunities to farm on support is actually pretty helpful if you can be at important fights and your adc is not alone. Tank supports it almost doesn't really matter for them, enchanters don't have the agency but any support who can do a bit of dps should take advantage in some of these situations. Im not saying to steal cs from your team or position bad on map for farm but if the cs is lost or you can create an advantage go for it.",

Id questions how it got to that situation, but it would happen rarely. Then you'd want to take farm. But these seem very rare. Almost always this will not be the case and you won't be taking farm.\n\nYou mentioned finding opportunities to farm if you can be at important fights and your ADC is not alone. How could all those be true? If you are near an important fight, I assume at least one of your solo laners, ADC or even jg should be there. Wouldn't it be better for them to take the farm? As for ADC not being alone, what does that mean? If they are with you, then they should be taking farm. If they are in a different lane then they aren't there for the team fight, and if they aren't there and they aren't alone then your team is split 3-2 and would for sure lose any team fight.",

I've been everywhere from unranked to diamond and people just go on their own and die a lot. Not my fault if I ping you back. They'll even walk in total darkness and then blame others when they die. Yeah, I'll catch that wave that is crashing somewhere right  now because their lame ass is dead for another 30 seconds. I cannot recall a single soloq game where this didnt happen, and I've been in almost every elo lol.",

Just that I like the option to gain extra gold or exp when the chance pops up so I can gain a slight advantage in items. Mage supports love items so most the time I'm looking to finish something quicker. Doesn't happen every game. \n\nAs far as being at important fights it's literally just macro.. You take the variables of the game currently happening and decide your next moves to maximize impact. It's way to much typing to describe a scenario and it's so hypothetical anyways. League can legit feel like a team game or like a bunch of cats dancing on keyboards. Generally you just want to look at player positioning/jungle timers/ spawn timers/ wave locations and you can legit predict the majority of major events in league. Plus your support legit your job to ward the shit out of objectives and the map so you end up getting some milage if your playing right.",

I actually think these nerfs put her in a spot that Riot wants her.  You can max E into W and go moonstone.

It's been a while since League had a champion based VS event, maybe Riot could do something like that (ala Rengar vs Kha 'Zix). Clash of Demons or something for the name? Doubt the VS event could really work like that but I think it's a pretty neat concept nonetheless.",

You can focus on actually playing, and you can kinda read the stuff you're using as you go.\n\nIf you don't rush to the endgame like the veterans, you can figure out most mechanics, as the base systems are introduced bit by bit. Of course, when you complete the campaign, and pretty much the true game starts, that's when you get flooded with mechanics. Some are very simple (touch this to spawn a lot of strong monsters for greater rewards) and self-explanatory, some are Betrayal.\n\nAnd since many people post their suggestions for initial starter builds, you can always just look at videos to see what looks like most fun to you, and go to town. Though do note a 3rd party character planner app is almost mandatory nowadays, and most builds are shared using it.\n\nSo honestly, there's no better way to start than today. Don't rush, take your time, and you'll be fine. It's just like League - the very idea of league isn't THAT complex, you just gotta remember lots of tiny things, like champion abilities. And since you're not playing against other players, it's kinda less stressful.",

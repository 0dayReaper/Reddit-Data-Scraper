I end up salty enough from getting bitch at about a losing lane like top that I decide to swap there for a few games so I don\u2019t have to worry about them being a problem, only to swap right back to jungle in a game or two cause I realize I trust nobody else in my lobbies when it comes to having smite. I\u2019d rather have someone bitching me out all game than give someone else smite and hope they don\u2019t whiff it.",

I take waves, make rotations and stay alive to take objectives and towers after teamfights.",

Then you don't have to focus on new mechanics, but can ficus on learning the basics of adc decision making.\n\n2. Don't always follow up, when your support engages. If you can't fight the enemies and your leona still goes in, just let her die by herself and tell her, that you can't fight.\n\n3. Keep calm and relax. Winning your lane is no longer only in your hands. Most support players are way worse than you would expect them to be in your elo. Dont get tilted by them.\n\n4. As a top laner if you were able to pop off in lane, you were a one man army and were free to do whatever you wanted. Now as adc you can still be blown up when going 10/0 and therefore can't just force stuff on your own.",

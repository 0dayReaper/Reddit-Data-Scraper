    "postText": "Hello everybody, \n\nI just hit Master after playing league since Season 2 (got a coach) and now I just read how much different the demotions system and inactivity penalty works. How are you guys dealing with that going on holidays? Spam games so you get the full 14 days before you demote? \nI haven\u2019t played that active in a while, what do the ranked season splits mean? \nIs it normal to get autofilled way more often since hitting master? (Did they remove auto fill protection) \n\nThanks in advance",

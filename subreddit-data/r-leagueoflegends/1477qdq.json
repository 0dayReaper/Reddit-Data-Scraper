    "postText": "I'm not sure how the support \"gold curve\" is during a usual match of League of Legends, but is it supposed to be this bad in the late game?   \n\n\nDuring the early game, you receive aid from your quest, and the very nature of the laning phase - poking, roaming, assists. However after that, when the game resumes itself to waiting for the right time to engage in team fights, fights for objetives, and more meaningful fights, Supports are sitting ducks in the gold matter.   \n\n\n**Literally, all you do is wait for gold to be generated.**  \n\n\nNot only you have finished your Support Item Quest (and are no longer generating gold through it), but if you help your team defend the base, push lanes, and so on and so forth, you also are penalized in gold for doing that too, receiving as far as 7 gold per minion, one third of all other roles.  \n\n\nAlongside that, with leavers being a somewhat common occurrence, I think that the Support Gold Penalties are outdated, and should be reviewed. It's often the case in a leaver game that the Support has to take up a lane to help his team, and by doing so you'll be (hopefully) farming.  \n\n\nAdditionally, in most games I'm on, Supports also receive a small EXP penalty during laning phase - not only are you diving EXP with another player, you (should) also ward, and try to roam once in a while, putting you at a further disadvantage. Almost all games I see in my elo (Platinum 2) and all I've seen climbing so far, the Support, be it on my team or the enemy team is always the lowest level.\n\nInitially, the support itemization was supposed to be slower in the endgame, as you had a \"free\" early item that evolved with you. However, with the last patch putting some emphasis on itemization in general, you WANT to build \"real\" items. If were not for it's vision capabilities, I'm sure Support items would be sold for other more enthralling options, which are many.  \n\n\n***This post is mainly constructed to gauge the community overall opinion on that matter - I want to see if others had similar, or even different experiences that I do.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxt594mlug5b1.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6318dd5e8577134ca8138dfec2265c876c6bf9ce",

As a support, damage isn't what you should be focusing on, utility is",

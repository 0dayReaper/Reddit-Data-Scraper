Next game I\u2019m playing voli and I ult him so he avoids his E, I outplay him strategically and he murders me after I E. This literally makes the game feel so broken wtf did I do wrong here? Are they both the best early game champions or something?",

How are you outplaying her if you cant even kill her. Sett is pretty good into fiora and you can absolutely bully her when she tries to fight you, if you are also outplaying her then what went wrong?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Next game I\u2019m playing voli and I ult him so he avoids his E, I outplay him strategically and he murders me after I E.\n\nYou... use your ultimate to knock him out of his E and expect to instantly win the fight? How is that outplaying him strategically at all? \n\nWhat you did wrong is thinking you played the fight correctly. This is the literal definition of a skill issue.",

Volibear wins lane if he can W you twice to proc the healing the extra damage, if you respect volibear W it should be a much easier lane for you since sett has somewhat better regeneration and volibear has mana issues so he can't keep spamming skills. These are both hard matchup for sett but both are winnable if you respect their abilities.",

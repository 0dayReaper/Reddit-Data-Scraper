            "comment": "The champs and items here are incredibly underpowered compared to Dota, you will have a hard time finding the similar skills and champ feel. Even for the champs you like, even though Dota 2 and League came from the same champ designs, it's so different. Akali might be... kinda... the feel of TA, not same skills, Lissandra is kinda QoP, with the mobility but without the damage. Could also say Vex with her ult.\n\nALRIGHTY let's break out the list. \n\nGame pace is much faster, no denying minions, no elevation hit mechanics, projectiles generally cannot be dodged once they have begun their travel (ie blink from projectiles), barely any active items, items are stat sticks comparatively, no stacking of camps, no leashing waves, jungle is strict, not much terrain destruction, wards are far smaller in vision granted, 1 sentry ward at a time unless support with a special item, cc timers are way lower, spells are far more explosive earlier, supports barely do damage in comparison, no MKB, no BKB, no Aghs, no refresher, the only blink dagger is a summoner spell called flash, which is tiny in range. Baron (roshan) gives a team buff, objectives like dragons with stacking stats exist, rift herald exists. You don't need to Micro your champ as much with summons. There's fewer insanely high skill floor champs. No secret shop, no buying from lane, items have passive that don't stack.\n\nOverall league is easier, definition of easy(er) to get into but hard to master. Things happen faster and games are done faster. You don't get as many decisions or things going on but its it's less forgiving for the decisions you can make.\n\nI'm deff glancing over like 50 other things but that's the major list.",

            "comment": "Sounds like you play assassins. If you want to learn the game I recommend Talon. He\u2019s easy to learn, has good mobility, and will pay dividends if you have good map awareness for picking off players out of position.\n\nLeague is much more mechanically intensive than Dota. Don\u2019t start by playing a difficult assassin. Other assassins that are not mechanically difficult are Master Yi, Diana, and Fizz.",

            "comment": "The way League design has evolved, it feels like a top down fighting game as if it were made as a WC3 custom map. So while basic skills like map awareness and camera control carry over nicely, the gameplay loop is significantly different\n\nLeague is significantly more focused on playing the character themselves in a cross between a fighter and a RPG. Items are basically just stat stick with mostly passive effects, and the champ themselves tends to focus on comboing abilities within their kit, very Kunkka-esque in general. Macro is a lot more simple as well, to the point where it feels like a tacked on designated \"take teamfight here\" timer.\n\nMost of your hero pools are mobile spell casting skirmishers. Yasuo/Yone/Akali/Irelia/Riven should be up your alley. None of them has the unconditional mobility of Ember either, but Yone has something kind of similar to being able to fly back to a spirit defensively.",

(I\u2019ll probably get hate for that statement xD)\n\nA few things to note:\nYou can\u2019t creep block, but creeps can block you.\nYou can\u2019t eat trees.\nYou have to back to buy. (Unless you\u2019re ornn) There\u2019s no donkey.\nIf a player dcs, you\u2019re just down a player, you can\u2019t control them.\nYou can\u2019t buy a blink/dash. (Unless you buy galeforce, but that\u2019s something different.)\n\nItems. Items have 3 tiers. Mythic the highest, legendary the second highest, and components the lowest.\n\nYou can only buy 1 mythic (galeforce is a crit mythic.) you can only buy 1 unique legendary. (Meaning you can buy multiple tank items, or go a tank item into mage items.) you understand components already. They just build into legendary.\n\nEach mythic gains stats based on the number of legendaries you have.\n\nAs for champions, looks like you play mostly assassins. Fizz, Talon, Zed, Akali, Qyiana, Katarina, I also wanna recommend GangPlank because pirate. I\u2019m forgetting some assassins but those are the ones I think you\u2019d enjoy most.",

They're listed as basic and epic items, epics are basically the step between basic components and fully completed mythics/legendaries. \n\nYou also have starter items but I believe that kinda explains itself",

I will NEVER go back to DotA 2. LoL is simpler but there's still a lot of depth to the game.  Fortunately a lot of your knowledge of mobas do transfer better to LoL than LoL to DotA 2.",

As soon as I get some more work done, I'll make a repository.  \n\nThe program is not even remotely done. The main idea is that it will tap on LoL live client data to figure out which champion is being played, and then set up keyboard macros, so that when you press R, a certain animation plays. So you could have different animation sets for Vel'Koz, Evelynn or Xerath. Only Vel'Koz for now because Vel'Koz mains.  \nSome people were right in that the animations don't trigger when an enemy is hit, or accounts for channel interruptions, it's just a timer.  \n\nThe next step will be integrating it with more stats, such as Health/Mana, to create interesting effects.  \n\nEDIT: I'm absolutely going to create a GitHub repo for this so you can contribute with animations for every champ. As soon as I add support for it and document everything up I'll post a follow-up with the repo link.\n  \nEDIT2: Check out the repository [here](https://github.com/nicolasdeory/leagueoflegends-led)! Help is greatly appreciated.",

With the amount of different champs and skills in the game, that would be a lot more work than coding a few flashes into a generic shooter setup. \n\nAnd it's always iffy to release a project that would only involve a few champions. So a proper release would have to cover all of them. That coupled with the fact that it's an ultimate luxury feature, it's pretty easy to see why it would never become a priority at Riot.",

I was working on something similiar last year but backed off after I almost fried my PSU trying to hook up the nodeMCU and leds to it so the thing would be contained in the PC itself. I accidentally disconnected a jumper wire that touched something else and sent the PSU into \"hey dont do that\" mode. A fuse got blown inside but it was easily replaceable, I'm scared to try again since then. What is your solution, are you just running this off an external PSU?",

I suspect adding extra layers instead of going directly from keyboard input could add noticeable latency.  Could you have your script  detect what window is active so it would only work if you were tabbed into the game?",

I'll have to think about how often I poll that data, but it shouldn't add any latency for any time-critical effects such as ability casts.\n\nGood point about the window focus though, it should definitely work only when you're tabbed into the game.",

    "postText": "Five years ago, I felt disconnected from my 17 year old son. All he talked about was League and I had never played a computer game in my life. I did not understand why he couldn't just stop mid-game when I needed him to. I did not understand his love of esports. We were drifting apart.\n\nSo, I asked him to teach me how to play.\n\nTo say that it was a steep learning curve is an understatement. But I kept at it because I loved him. The more I understood about the game, the closer we got. After some disastrous games on Summoner's Rift (where I was rightly flamed for not knowing how to ping), I switched to just playing ARAM because it forced me to learn what all champions do. It was also more chill.\n\nWhile I was never very good and never tried playing ranked, I understood enough to enjoy watching the LCK, MSI and Worlds. In 2019, my son and I travelled to Taiwan together to watch both of the semifinals of MSI. It is a memory that I will always cherish.\n\nNow that he has grown up and left home, I don't play anymore but I am so grateful that I made the effort to understand the game he loved. Definitely worth.",

I needed like 5 minutes to understand the basics goals in CS:GO but I don't even know where I'd have to start explaining league to someone. It usually goes like: \"You have 2 teams of 5 people each and whoever destroys the enemies 'Nexus' wins. Every person can choose a different character with different abilities each game.\" And then I don't know what to say next that isn't completely overwhelming.\n\nI think this League's biggest problem (next to toxicity) right now. Nobody can casually start playing the game without lots of advice from more experienced friends. The tutorial shows you the basic controls but that's about it. I guess LoL really needs better tutorials/bot games that maybe teach some basic strategy and itemization too or something like the StarCraft Archon Mode where you could put an experienced player in some control of the champion or something\n\nI can't imagine how tough it must be for fighting game casuals (since I pretty much never played a fighting game)\n\nEdit: last part to get back to fighting games, my bad",

It just doesn't make much sense in terms of investment. You're sort of setting yourself up to lose a significant portion of your player base. Or increasing the resources required for the same player base if they split between LOL and LOL 2\n\nThe only reason would be to do a hard reset on the champion pool and map of a significant change to game mechanics...\n\n\nI guess VR would be something too....",

I've always wanted to play a Meepo/The Lost Vikings equivalent in League. However, due to engine limitations Riot has never implemented a champion like this. There are champions kind of like this, like Shaco, but he's very limited with what you can do with the clone. Riot also said players were too fucking dumb for these champions, but this was before abilities had novel-long descriptions like Aphelios.",

We talked politics, and it started to get ugly, and I decided I wanted no more political talk when they visited here. And of course he could say whatever he wanted. His house and all.\n\nOne time we were listening to my sister talk about getting help from the church they had just joined. She was a person who milked every bit of goodwill out of people by constantly wanting stuff. My stepdad and I looked at each other and shook our heads (in the next room), and we bonded over people taking responsibility for their own business in life. I was a teen mom and didn't rely on my parents for income or housing. I took care of my own business and he greatly respected that. My mom told me so.\n\nAlso neither of us liked church or religion. We would behave in church and all, but when people started talking about it outside church we were both happy to move away from it at family events. \n\nHe also loved to travel. I would ask him to tell me about their latest trip and he would talk and talk, and I'm always interested in learning about new cultures and lands. It killed time and made it easier to be in the same space together. \n\nI had to work hard to figure out how to relate to him, but he was a good man and loved my mother and took very good care of her. So to respect my mother I tried hard, and it wasn't easy. \n\nI tried to make it easier on my kids. My first child is a character who I found difficult as a teen. I was doing research on teens and found music is a really good thing to try to relate to teens. So I told him I wanted to hear his favorite music. \n\nThe first thing he did was to play Eminem's song about \"sorry mama, I'm cleaning out my closet.\" He moved out because we cramped his style being his parents and all. \n\nThen he played another Eminem song and said it reminded him of me. And soon I had a much better understanding of how he felt and what he believed and what he cared about. And it confirmed that he still loved us and tried to do the right thing. It was amazing to get through to him. I'm still an Eminem fan.\n\nOur middle kid was into all things Harry Potter and Japanese. She also did Okinawan taiko drumming for many years. I know every song they did to this day. And now she's gay and married to her wife and so happy. \n\nThen for our youngest, he was a big reader, so I read the books he liked. We talked books all the time. He liked Gregor the Overlander, so I read it (loved it). Now he's grown and shares podcasts with me. He was also the one who brought me to Reddit! That's why a grandma on her 50s is a redditor of 7 years. And we send each other stuff all the time.\n\nWe are on great terms with our kids, and we love to share their interests. Don't stop trying to relate. There's common ground somewhere with your kid and it's your job to find it. You won't regret it.",

I remember being 13 hearing my parents argue about how all I would do is sit in my room and play Call of Duty or league, it hurt. \n\nBut it also served as a wake up call for me. I started going out of my way to connect with my parents, whether it was forcing myself to go through the hell that is CrossFit to bond with my mom, or taking a break from my \u201cpro CoD team\u201d (a bunch of kids playing game battles thinking they\u2019d make it) to go grab a burger or cheesesteak with my dad. It\u2019s important you try also, I don\u2019t know you at all, and if you\u2019ve tried this and seen no results I\u2019m sorry. But I urge you to keep trying. \n\nThis goes out to anyone who struggles in their home life, parents aren\u2019t inherently bad, they\u2019ve likely just had some bad teachers (their parents).",

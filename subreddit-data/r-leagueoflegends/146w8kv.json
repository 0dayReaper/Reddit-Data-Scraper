Dragging people is super fun :) but seems the majority of the league community is not a fan.\n\nMy feeling is he maybe needs little less team reliance and some skill expression in his q w r and he'd be a pick everyone could enjoy.",

It being a balancing factor that means his clear is way better in the jungle than trying to lane, which makes him undesirable from the grounds up for most of the playerbase as not as many people jungle overall.\n\nBut above all, his kit is just seen as outdated, and lacking in factors that people commonly find fun - no dashes, no burst damage, no flashy outplays and the like. His dragging mechanic isn't particularly fun to people over how tedious everything else around it is, with him being unable to auto attack the person he's himself ccing making him more team reliant which itself is a minus in most people's eyes, him being a fighter that does more steady damage instead of spiky bursts of damage, having trouble engaging by himself and so on.",

The problem is that most people are entirely unware of it.\n\nSkarner's ult is a suppression that continually applies a displacement, that doesn't register as a displacement. There are a lot of abilities that are displacement immune (but not cc-immune) that Skarner can interrupt as long as the enemy is targetable. For example: Skarner can just snatch Nocturne mid-flight out of his ult. Same for goes Sett's ult, Rek'sai's, Shyvana's, Kalista's ally during her ult, along with several others. There are some weird interactions with a few.\n\nHe can do some really cool, fight/game-winning shit with his ult that no one else in the game can, if his reaction times are good enough. His whole usefulness with and without spires makes playing for those moments feel a bit poop.",

So Skarner as a champion doesn't really seems to exist, he is just there to introduce the plot point of Brackern.",

He has a maxHP shield on W, and an E that can stun all 5 enemies, and has its cooldown reduced for each enemy he stuns, just build heavy tank. Need a diver to pick out priority targets? His movespeed tank build with phase rush allows him to run in and grab someone out with ult after procing phase rush. Need a juggernaut? Build black cleaver and Trinity Force, your Q deals maxHP mixed damage, has its cooldown reduced by auto attacks, and can activate spellblade off cooldown. There's also other \"off-meta\" builds like AP or the support build that play off how many different things he can do. I think the majority of the player base focuses on the movespeed tank build, which imo is the least appealing. And the other builds require more understanding of the \"fine print\" of his abilities",

If there was a spire, even a nerfed one, in toplane (and I guess botlane too for symmetry) I'd play him top for sure. His gameplay imo is pretty cool toplane for a tank, you pull your opponent into your tower lol. But having no spire makes you just mediocre the whole time, having the spire to fight over would be interesting in lane matchups",

Gives a very small shield and a low ramping move speed that goes away if the weak shield is broken.\n\nNo more choo choo items that let you run at people fast to use R\n\nDoes no damage and dies instantly...

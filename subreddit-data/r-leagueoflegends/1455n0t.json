    "postText": "Hello guys! \nLast year Riot revealed the \"Three Honors\" skin line as a reward for players, who reached Honor level 5 at the end of the season. \nSince this years season is cut into two splits, I was wondering if we will get two Three Honor skins this year? Or only one at the end of this year? I wont reach Honor level 5 by the end of this split.\nThankful for any information and good luck in your ranked games! :)",

If I play 2 games a day I get it in 24 days, if I play a ton I get it in 18 days. But there's a hard limit of like 17 days for each checkpoint",

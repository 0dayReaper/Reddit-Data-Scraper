    "postText": "People shit all over Yuumi for just attaching and afking but atleast Yuumi does something. Every Malz player I come across just auto pushes, and then gets ganked and dies, rinse, repeat. Nothing screams I have no idea what I'm doing like applying a DOT spell and making a minion to kill said DOT spell for you. I don't see any Malz player manage cool downs, use their Q's in a way to maximize damage, and hell I don't think any of them know that hitting a champ with your Q prolongs the DOT. Anyways, just tired of insta losing when I see that Malz lock in Champ select.",

The champs winrate actually *increases* in challenger lol\n\nRegardless OP is saying that when an ally malz locks in the champ he loses every time, which says more about him than the ally that picked him",

Even if his winrate is higher in low elo because he's easy to pilot, his actual pattern of play finds a lot more value in better quality of games. Similar to TF.",

My friend was playing Malz in GM last season (I think he's masters rn but I haven't talked to him in a bit anyway) so I'm kind of just parroting the things he'd say back then. \n\nIt makes sense to me though, having played champs like TF and Lissandra who really want to get value off of their first couple ultimates, it feels really bad to play in lower elos where you'll have junglers and supports who won't play towards these timings, or carries who won't consistently utilize leads you create.\n\nThere's obviously a lot that goes into it and a lot I don't know, but that's my interpretation which I think is at least not completely wrong.\n\nEDIT: he was actually playing it in season 11 not last season, time flies lol",

Your complaint is really about skill usage during trades and lane management on a champ like malzahar?",

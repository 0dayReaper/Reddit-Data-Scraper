I play aggressive, I lose, I sit back when other lanes are winning, eventually lose. \n\nI know I'm not the best but I feel I'm doing the best I can and I don't know how to progress from here. I know everyone says this but I feel all my team mates are out to make my life hell. Like I said I know I'm not perfect I make mistakes but I just can't carry a game. I can't even get in a game. I hear adc is the easiest role as well so it's not like I can just swap role and climb that way. \n\nWhat are some tips I can do to improve my game, and how to people improve their mental. My last support has completely broken mine.\n\nThanks in advance all.",

I recommend looking at youtube guides on wave control from channels like skillcapped as that helped me get from gold to diamond in less than two years. One problem however is that supports mess up the wave constantly, but skillcapped makes sure to account for those scenarios in their demonstrations.\n\nI also turned off chat, it helps a lot.",

One of the main things that cause a lot of my ADC students to lose games was simply they didn't value how much them being alive mattered. \r  \n\r  \nAs ADC you help secure objectives, help with consistent dps, and over all make doing things around the map possible.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, with great power comes great responsibility. You must think about what can kill you at all times, you must also participate in as many fights as possible. This is where backing on time and CS properly come in handy. Especially in lower ranks, it's easy to have a damage boost simply because players do not farm well.\r  \n\r  \nWhen playing ADC your focus is to survive laning phase and be relavent come early transition into mid game. If you fail to be at least even by that time, it'll be extremely hard to win. \r  \n\r  \nMost of the time we notice our teams feeding, but what we don't notice is the face the players dying are worth less and less each time. If you continuously farm, you'll eventually have more gold, which in tern means more damage. Kills mean nothing, gold income does.\r  \n\r  \nTLDR: Focus on maintaining a consistent gold lead, focus on being at the right fights at the right time, focus on objective control and you'll be set.\r  \n\r  \nHope it helps, good luck in your games!",

But yeah, when all the other lanes are losing you cannot do too much when you don't know how to carry T_T",

Just with this you can dodge skillshots and play much more fluidly, also practice csing maybe and click aim in training too",

ADC is the most forgiving I reckon if you play like jinx, you can play Ashe xayah etc but stuff like aphel twitch draven is entirely different. If you play mid stuff like victor xerath lux neeko plays similar but sylas azir ahri plays different.\nTop is definitely the hardest to play variety and maining is best here because in top, Laning phase is much more important and so volatile",

Winning lane as adc is waiting for your opponent to make mistakes and punishing them. If you win lane game becomes much easier. Most important part of the game is the early game so I would focus on that first then you can work on mid game.",

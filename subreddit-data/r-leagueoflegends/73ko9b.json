I'll trust that you guys will be able to act decently.\n\nNote: To the guy who send [this](https://imgur.com/U2S17Z5) I'm deeply sorry mate and I hope you saved your comment.\n\n--------------\nHi everyone,\n\n~~As you may have noticed this post is now locked.~~\n\nFirst and foremost I want to reassure most of you that this post will most likely not get removed (under caveat that I didn't miss anything or the Op do not make rule breaking edits).\n\n~~I am the only mod connected and available at this time, with the situation being so controversial, people are understandably being heated up, sometimes going way over the line. Sadly I am not able to properly moderate this thread with me alone.~~\n\n~~So until more people are online this post will be locked. It will be unlocked once more mods get online.~~",

He has been permanently banned on over 20 accounts. He started to get popular and pulled this crap against pro players, who criticized him. \n\nRiot, the company that made League, got wind of him due to this and his growing reputation and indefinitely banned him. They will also ban further accounts of his.\n\nIt's been over a year now since this happened and the current Tyler is \"Reformed\". Doesn't support toxicity anymore and supports Riot Games. People are predicting that he will get unbanned soon.\n\nThis is a post about a Riot Games employee who is talking negatively and wishes death upon Tyler.",

Most of the lore I know about aatrox is that was he was an ascended great general that slowly was corrupted after death of azir and the void war. Then the whole first darkin war caused him to be sealed by the prior aspect of twilight. He then came back and stole a bunch of bodies trying to make a body that was similar to how he use to be but couldn\u2019t because he was a god warrior and no one could handle it. \n\nBased on that I\u2019d assume he have very poor intelligence of blood magic seeing how the other darkin are able to make decent bodies with one person versus aatrox who has to go through like 100s. It be like comparing a butcher that takes pieces of meat and puts them together to create something versus a surgeon.",

Darkins pretty much consume the host and take over their body.\n\nYou only hear those who have willpower/spirit/protection/plot armor to fight against their corruption and takeover.\n\nThe only reason you can hear Kayn is because he is actually not a finished transformation, and both are fighting each other for control. Raasth takes over kayn and you no longer hear kayn, and viceversa.\n\nVarus is corrupting Vai and Valmar and taking over their bodies. One of them, valmar, was fine with accepting Varus as he wanted revenge against the attackers, the other tried to stop him from giving in to Varus through the power of ~~Love~~ male friendship. This is why their form is a 3-host, as Varus isn't able to completely corrupt valmar, which would finish the transformation. **Basically they are that cartoon gag of a guy with a devil and an angel as conscience**. Varus also seems to be more \"reasonable\" than other Darkin, less maddened than Aatrox, and less bloodthirsty than Raasth, which means Valmar and Kai are able to slowly push him towards \"good\" or at least more controlled violence while he seeks vengeance.",

From his lines, I don't think that Naafiri is his sister in the familial sense, if he even has one.\n\nIt's interesting he specifically mentions Valeeva, Xolaani and Naafiri as his sisters. Xolaani and Naafiri make sense, given their prominence, but this is the first time Valeeva's been mentioned since [Twilight of the Gods.](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/twilight-of-the-gods/) There, Valeeva did specifically have a absent brother, and people theorized that was Varus. I wonder if that could still be true. I wonder what Valeeva's unique ambition Varus mentions is.",

And the only way is through war after what humans did to him. I also found really deep this line \"As a human or a Darkin, I was always a weapon\". This sums up a lot of his theme and why he does what he does. It is nice how Valmar and Kai try to redeem Varus or make him see there are other ways to find peace.\n\nNote: it is so weird not to find the Varus subreddit (to protest against the new Reddit api changes).",

Ferret's play was strange but it was pretty enough to put FUT botlane and jungler behind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIW as a whole still looks like the team from EMEA Masters timeline. FUT looks the same as well except they have a pretty good adc who tries to carry them this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2h3chsmmh06b1.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=44e01e847dec914cba14f94d1768d36a15dd25a5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl5d8jxmh06b1.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ea3099bb1982f61afd06245dc5cc029c12d9b6c4",

Caitlyn had 2 Legendaries with her ASU (Pulsefire/Battle Academia) but it was having to basically completely reinvent all of her skins pre-Headhunter and doing a lot of work touching up the rest that took the time, much like with Ahri and her 2 (SG/Spirit Blossom) and having to completely redo everything pre Academy/Challenger from fresh.\n\nThe legendaries get small tweaks at best, but remain quite similar to how they were. Teemo and his 2 (Omega/Groove) are gonna be little to no different but you bet your ass everything pre-Devil except Omega is going to be basically brand spanking new. Which is SEVEN skins excluding his base.  The impact of having to do an ASU on 2 champs released in 2011 (Caitlyn/Ahri) vs doing one on a champ that is **Original 17** is more night and day than people expect.",

In retrospect the monthly schedule we originally had for Clash looks like it was a better fit for a larger time commitment that requires some preparation and in exchange should be more of a high moment",

Those 4 months can also have SR clashes the following/previous 2 weeks.

No matter how much planning is done, shit happens especially as an adult. I\u2019ve got a group of about 7-9 people that regularly play, but it\u2019s still really tough getting a full set for clash on any given weekend with a week notice. The more tournaments the better for us as it simply gives more chances to actually work. I\u2019d honestly rather they run clash every weekend. It\u2019s by far the most fun part of league for me.",

Kind of feels like jungle and top are left in the dust, but hey I do understand that ultimate skins take a lot of effort, so its \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb",

Essentially any skin released for an ADC isn't just a skin for that particular champs mains but for ADC mains as a whole. Its also why Senna gets so many skins, since she hits both ADC mains and enchanter mains in one go. \n\nAnd I'm not surprised its Samira getting the ultimate. Not only does she have an incredibly flashy kit that lends itself well to an ultimate skin, shes been one of the most consistently popular characters in the game since her release.",

And Plat 4-2 players are being gate kept by Plat 1 players. Adding Emerald will allow all the Good P2-p1 players to populate in emerald and stop gate keeping lower plat players. Then that will cause a chain effect allowing from a top down rank increase by probably 2-3 divisions. So my prediction is if you're silver 2 right now you will probably be gold 4-3 next split, and if you're plat 4-3 you will most likely be plat 2-1.",

Imagine they started associating new accounts to IDs or phone numbers and banning those instead of just the lol account. Suddenly they'd have to justify why their influx of \"new players\" (more like new accounts) would start dropping.\n\nA bit of tinfoil hat I know but honestly nothing else makes sense as a reason",

So Blizzard Spread out more the High Elos.\n\nLeague has a similar Problem, but with Lower Ranks, so they're spreading out the Lower Elos.\n\nI'm guessing everything till around Diamond will be shifted Upwards 1 rank.\n\nSo:\n\nLive Iron&gt; New Bronze\n\nLive Bronze&gt; New Silver\n\nLive Silver&gt; New Gold\n\nLive Gold&gt; New Plat\n\nLive Plat&gt; New Emerald Rank\n\nAnd those that were averaging D4/P1 will probabaly end up in low/Mid diamond now.\n\nLeague is a weird game rank-wise, as the Article states, it is REALLY Bottom heavy, where what would usually be considered the \"Average Ranks\" Gold/Plat, where most people usually Dwell in other Games, are currently **Above Average** (gold) and **Significantly above average** (Plat) in League.\n\nMeanwhile the **\"average player\"** is Silver. Which is very strange, since Silver should represent the \"Bad\" players, not your average dude.\n\nBeing Silver in Valorant or Overwatch or any game really, means you suck ass compared to the \"Average player\", so you're fairly below average, meanwhile being Silver in league means you're where most people are on Average.\n\n**Basically in league:**\n\n* Iron= Bad\n* Bronze/Silver= Average\n* Gold/Plat = Above average\n* Dia=  Good players\n* M+= Actually good players\n\n**In Most other games:**\n\n* Iron= Bad\n* Bronze/Silver= Below Average\n* Gold/Plat= Average\n* Diamond= Good players\n* M+= Actually good players.\n\nThe takeaway from this is:\n\nThe new \"Default insult\" will be **\"Shitty Gold player\"** instead of **\"Shitty Silver player\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPGRADES!",

It just feels kind of weird for Samira to get one before a lot of these beloved champs\n\nEdit: my dumbass thought ultimate = legendary. My comment is invalid ultimate skins should be based on concepts that go beyond the scope of legendaries and should not be connected to popularity. \n\nGive Sylas a legendary though rito",

Ahri was released this year but she was meant to be the 2022 ASU, that just ended up delayed. That's one single ASU across two years. At least Lee Sin should've been able to get released at the end this year.\n\nConsidering that there's nothing to share on Jax and Skarner, the latter which is already confirmed to be in 2024 too, we're just getting nothing this year. The pacing from champion updates in both ASUs and VGUs is atrocious.\n\nEdit: Jax is still coming this year. He is done by the champions team rather than the ASU team though, so that doesn't mean anything about the ASU pacing.",

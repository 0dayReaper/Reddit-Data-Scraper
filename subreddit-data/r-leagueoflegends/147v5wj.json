TBH i play this game to talk with people. its an adult fighting game. so i use adult language. just shit these days",

I roasted them the whole game, because 4/5 players on their team swapped sums, and 3/5 of them deranked in flex queue with a bunch of 3 minute losses, and my team whooped their asses for the clash trophy.",

They left the restriction because it\u2019s time gated for 3 days. Whatever.  But they fixed the Honour level.\n\nI had to appeal 3 different times.  First time I got Blitzbot, Second time Virtuoso just RPing as Jhin and not actually answering my question. Third [I forget which it was atm] sent me the chat logs. And FINALLY Manakete sorted it out.\n\nEdit: I was NOT particularly nice in my message pointing out that I had already been restricted for the same chat and that it was ~14 weeks old.",

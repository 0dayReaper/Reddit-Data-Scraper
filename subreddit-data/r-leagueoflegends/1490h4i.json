Was gaining like 20 per win and losing like 25+. \n\nWent on a MASSIVE streak and am currently plat 2, gaining 30-32 per win, and losing 20 or so per loss. Literally just win more games. That\u2019s all you do.\n\nIt\u2019s hard, but that\u2019s all you have to do. You need to win consistently enough that the game goes \u201cyou deserve a higher rank\u201d.\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t? Well\u2026 sorry to break it to you, but maybe your problem isn\u2019t your Lp gains (hint it basically never is). It\u2019s how you play, you need to focus more on improving than ranking up.\n\nBesides, imo, in literally every game ever, low elo players should focus more on learning and improving than gaining some small amount of elo. An extra 30lp won\u2019t mean anything. But improving from a bronze/silver level to a gold/plat level would be massive for you. \n\nLook up coaching videos, main a few champions, do vod reviews, play consistently, think about what you\u2019re doing in game, learn as much as you can. You\u2019ll improving surprisingly quickly. Then, AFTER you\u2019ve improved, you\u2019ll start to climb naturally.",

Normals mmr and ranked mmr are different, but since you have never played ranked before, the game has to estimate your ranked mmr, leading to huge discrepancies. If you were losing so much lp, it means you were playing against people with much lower mmr, since you are expected to win, winning is rewarded less and losing is punished more. The more you play, the more accurate mmr becomes. \n\nPersonally, I think MMR changes too slowly, which leads to A LOT of grinding to see significant change",

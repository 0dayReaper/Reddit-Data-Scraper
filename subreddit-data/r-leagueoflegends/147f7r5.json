    "postText": "Serious question. \n\nAfter realizing the gameplay is stale and unfun (yet horrifyingly addicting by corporate design)\u2026 I have quit the game for 3 months plus now. In many ways, I feel healthier though I\u2019ve large substituted the mindless league addiction with other addictions. \n\nSo should I come back because of Emerald?\n\nI was S2 so in theory the addition of a new low rank (Emerald) tier could give me an artificial, near effortless climb to S1 if not low Gold. Gold looks a lot better than Silver and I can then tell people I am above average at the game again. \n\nMany seasons ago I was low Gold but since then, I\u2019ve been a high Silver.\n\nShould I allow Riot to manipulate my ego and come back? Or should I stick to my logic (Riot sucks, this game is a giant dangerous trap, ranked is a form of psychological manipulation) and stay away? \n\nWas the addition of Emerald intended to rope people like me back in (people wanting to reclaim a higher visible rank?).",

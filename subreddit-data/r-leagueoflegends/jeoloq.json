I know that this isn't a huge achievement compared to everyone else on this subreddit, but my [chronic illness/lack of time] has made it quite hard for me. However, finally after all these years I was able to reach [x rank], after just over [x number of games]. \n\nI have no friends who play league, so I just wanted to share this with you guys because I'm super proud of myself and reaching [x rank] has been my goal for [long period of time], but most people I know wouldn't really care. Thanks for reading, love y'all. :)",

I asked her if it could just cost 1000 and I could choose it myself and she said yes.

I don't get why you need 2000 - 3000.",

Infinite posts from \"League refugees\" who have played hots for a  grand total of 20 minutes but have decided it's unilaterally the best  game that has ever been made. \n\nYooooooooooooo.\n\nI started playing OG dota back when it was a wc3 mod. Was playing through a website which helped with match making. They also followed your stats thats how I know I played over 2000 games of OG dota. \n\nThen I moved on to LOL in season 1. Tried some HoN, didn't catch me, so I stuck to League. Played League exclusevily for another 2000 games. Tried DotA 2, stuck with LOL. Finally reached D5 and called it quits for a couple of years.\n\nThen HOTS finally makes an appearence, as a Blizzard fan boy I wanted to try it out. I did, I liked it, stuck with it for a while. I thought HOTS is the MOBA for me. You don't need to farm, you start with 3 abilities, no shop  to make things too complicated, easy to learn game, fuck it's so cool, multiple maps, best MOBA by far.\n\nThen the novelty started to wear off. Meta's were born for each map, best picks, etc. I actually didn't invest as much time in HOTS as I did in og dota or LoL. But at one point, because of friends I started playing DOTA 2, then played some HOTS again, then some LOL again, on and off, not too much, probably 100 games in each before moving on, and what I learned is that all 3 are great MOBAS.\n\nThere is something to like about each, and it's easy why you would prefer one over the other. What I learned is that they are all cool, especially if you have friends to play with.\n\nBut for me, League is my favorite, because of the esports scene which keeps me invested. And I just like getting gold rank for end season rewards with my friend.",

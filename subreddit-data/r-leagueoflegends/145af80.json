Vander was decent but I'm hard pressed to think of any split (apart from maybe Summer 2014) where I'd consider him anywhere higher than 3rd best in his position. He also never won LEC/EU LCS if I'm not mistaken, so the combination of those factors is probably why his name isn't really at the top of most people's minds.\n\nIf we looked at the top 5 supports of all time in EU, there isn't really a case for putting Vander above Yellowstar, Mikyx, Hyli or Mithy. You could at max have him 5th, depending on how you think he stacks up against the old names like Edward/Krepo and newer players like Kaiser.",

The point is exactly what you're saying - sometimes it's not about getting a better player.\n\nI don't know many teams who didn't run back the same roster after having a year like rogue did. What if they collapsed because that roster was the jackpot of synergy? More often than not, the pieces fitting together is more efficient than being a bunch of fakers when you're a team. \n\nYou can still argue that either way, almost no one on rogue roster is performing right now like they did last year. Had they kept odo right now but the others kept playing the way they do, I think there's only so much impact he would have on their placement, but can't know for sure. It's not something random plebs like us can analyze. Still,  malrang and comp last year vs now are two different worlds.",

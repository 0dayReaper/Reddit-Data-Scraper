There's not a lot of legacy content only for the veterans and nothing that gives an inherent advantage in a match.  \n  \nThe graphics is a bit dated but I don't see any reason for why someone can't enjoy this because of its age.",

There's a very significant chance you won't enjoy it, especially if you can't enjoy not knowing what's going on - League is an extraordinarily complex game, and it takes dozens of hours to even grasp the basics.

Personally starting out I think the best thing to do is pick 2 roles and learn as much as you can about the champions in those roles then pick your favorites and stick with those. The average player is in silver. It takes a lot of time and dedication to get better at the game kind of like chess but not as serious unless u care about people raging in chat. 3/4 games people in chat can eat a chode.",

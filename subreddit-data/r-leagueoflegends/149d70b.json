    "postText": "I feel disrespected as a Yuumi main. Riot created a champion that they are visibly ashamed of but they seem to be incapable of simply removing it from the game, possibly because they would have to refund all the money spent on Yuumi skins, etc. Instead they keep nerfing it, I have lost the count on how many times Riot has nerfed Yuumi, it is a complete disrespect for Yuumi players.",

    "postText": "So were only allowed 1 ban each and we all have multiple Champs we hate so we'd have to decide one of them to be banned which will allow the rest to be open\n\nBut that would probably change if double bans do get added \n\nSo here's my guesses on which champions could reach a 90% banrate\n\nTop - Illaoi, Kled and Darius\n\nJG - Vi, Rammus, Maokai (nidalee high elo)\n\nMid - Zed, Yone, Katarina \n\nAdc - Samira, Nilah, Twitch \n\nSupport - Yuumi and any hook champions (Blitz, Pyke, etc)\n\nTHESE ARE BASED IN LOW ELO SINCE MOST OF THE PLAYERBASE IS SILVER - GOLD",

            "comment": "As ppgod wandered the land with his disciples, bringing health to the people and fertility to the land, he couldn't help but notice an uneasiness on the faces of the common folk. New in the area, there seemed to be a plague on the land - one that he couldn't quite put his finger on.\n\nHe used his omniscient vision to search deep into the cosmos, reading the emotions of every individual he had come across with such a defeated expression. A conclusion was quickly reached - the current king of the land had long since gone mad. Crushing the people's will and cruel beyond reason, ppgod's powers revealed to him visions of those that had been trapped in the savage king's dungeon for years.\n\nJian \"Uzi\" Zi-hao. Shi \"Ming\" Sen-ming. Many, many more. The torture they had recieved while locked away under the key of the mad monarch rang through the mind of the lord, with an energy so vile that it caused brother Shanji to begin vomiting on the spot - as violently as if he had eaten the unholy beef noodles.\n\nIt was decided that something had to be done. ppgod told his disicples to wait, and he set off alone to march toward the palace. As this grand one-man army approached the gates, the great irony of the situation revealed itself. The king had sent his best soldiers away to the dungeons to languish, and now he only had rabble left to truly defend his life. \n\nLin \"Tangyuan\" Yu-Hong, one of the newest members of the Royal Guard, had not yet had time to be corrupted by the unholy energy of his superior. As ppgod and his eternal wisdom approached the gates, holy energy washed over the young midlaner - purifying his soul in an instant. Suddenly, without thinking, he rushed forward, running it down and impaling his monarch on his sword.  As the king's limp body slumped forward, he could only mutter one word between the bloody wretches of death,\n\n\"Traitor.\"\n\n\"No. I no longer serve you, for the lord has arrived. The time has come for royals to give up.\"\n\n\\- Excerpt from the Book of the Tyrant\n\nAmen.",

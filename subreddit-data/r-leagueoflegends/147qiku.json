    "postText": "It's probably not very motivating for players who want to reach Diamond (or just want to grind in general) when they have \\~8 identical looking divisions still to go. I'm a casual player too and if I had to start from Gold/low Plat again I would give up honestly. I used different elo tiers as intermediate goals or as reward and it felt always like a big accomplishment. I know that low elo players get a small promotion from adding Emerald, but it doesn't change much in my opinion. It just looks far too similar to Platinum",

How many games you'll have to play/win, however, depends on your rank.\n\nIf you're Iron, Bronze, or Silver, you'll need 1600 Split Points for that split's Victorious skin.\n\nIf you're Gold or higher, then you'll only need 80 Split Points. (Note that this is true only while you're Gold or higher! If you demote before unlocking the skin, your goalposts will be shifted to 1600 Split Points)\n\nStarting with Season 2023, we've simplified how you earn Split Points. You'll still need to queue up in either Ranked Solo/Duo or Flex, but you'll get 10 Split Points per victory and 6 Split Points per loss.",

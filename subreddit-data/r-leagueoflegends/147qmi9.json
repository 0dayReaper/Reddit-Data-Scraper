    "postText": "I love to play the game, even though I hate the game with all my heart. I hate everything Summoner's Rift stands for, but I love to play ARAM. This is because ARAM is fast paced, skill based combat, and doesn't have all this macro BS, that I hate about SR.   \nProblem is.... I cannot choose my champion.   \n\n\nWhy is this a problem? Well because I love certain champions, and I hate others. I play this game to have fun, and having to play yuumi, Sejuani, or Rammus is just boring for me. I'd love to see nexus blitz become a permanent gamemode because it offers everything ARAM does, but enables picking your champion.   \nI have 6k RP sitting on my account, and I'd love to use them on skins, but I cannot since I wont buy a skin for a champion, that I rarely get to play in ARAM.",

I rarely play ARAM, most of my games are ranked, but whenever urf is out I spam the shit out of it. \n\nI also miss when riot would make special game modes for events, not even talking about odyssey or star guardian.

I'll try it but I don't see myself sticking to it.\nWhile I guess that it is a tournament to make sure   it runs, a free for all between 4 pairs sounds more exciting and fun than a tournament. A tournament can get stressful and competitive, maybe even feel bad if you lose early, and I feel that what league needs is something more chill. Closer to ARAM with many players and no random pick, and not so much to that one event with 1v1 arams. Something that removes the tedious parts of summoner's rift (farming, long games, Laning, Map control) while accentuating the fun ones (fighting, becoming stronger with items and exp, and objectives)\nThe augments do sound nice. Maybe a mode that emphasizes craziness with cool doom bots like augments would be nice.",

Similar to Alterac Valley in Wow or Domination in COD.\n\nFast paced champs are good at hit and run, supports and tanks are great for assaulting, turtling champs could hold nodes and artillery mages could assault them.\n\nEvery different type of play style was somewhat viable depending on champion balancing.\n\nI played maybe 1200 Dominion games before they took it away.\n\nThere was also the custom game mode King of the Hill.\n\nIf you team wins you get a node, they stay in to fight the next guy 1v1 and you only back when you die.\n\nIt was like the monkeys on the boat in the Simpsons but it was amazing.  Then there was hide and seek, it was bliss.\n\nI get they took the map down but they also removed it from custom which sucked massive ass.\n\nI miss the fuck out of dominion.",

How I would set it up if I worked at riot is that there would be three rounds per match and it would be a first to two round wins for the match win. Round 1 is every champion is at lvl 6, round 2 is lvl 11, and round 3 is lvl 16. Each of these rounds would have a variable amount of gold for each player to spend that goes up each round. I would also totally be ok with new items and balancing items and champions speicific to this game mode. Pick ban would be regular draft with one ban per player. I think having multiple maps would be cool, but it would be fine with just one.",

My buddies and I played a community tournament match against what would be the equivalent of top 50 challengers (possibly higher ranked than that). Their reaction times and decision making were insane.\n\nAfter a while, that's what the ranked ladder was; 300ish players who basically no-life'd Battlerite. Imagine being Gold in skill and consistently playing against Master-Challenger ranks because that's all that the ladder had for you to be matched against. You couldn't realistically learn because you'd get stomped so hard that you didn't even realize your mistakes.\n\nThat, and the devs tried to ride the god-awful battle royale train and lied about making it free as part of the base game.",

I responded to the energy from the original post in kind, if they want to have an actual conversation about a mode akin to ARAM but where you can choose your champ sure. \n\nTalking about that seriously I don't think it could really exist in a way that wouldn't be either horribly imbalanced or wouldn't become super cookie cutter with comps. Think late original Overwatch where you played Zarya and Brig and you liked it or you lost. Ofc League has a wider breadth of champs, but it's the nature of gamers to find the \"optimal\" solution and then it just becomes optimal team vs optimal counter vs occasional alteration to optimal team that makes them able to play against optimal counter. ARAM circumvents this by making it random and people STILL ruin it at high MMR ARAM with ARAM only accounts that have specific broken champs unlocked on it where they get them a high amount of time due to their low pool.\n\nI think rather than saying macro is \"bs\" I'd be more interested in seeing what's wrong with it per them and what could be done on another map mode to make it interesting for them to give more depth to said new map mode. Idk I was put off by the energy of the original post, I'm not trying to shit on ARAM. I just don't think it's constructive to say \"xyz is bs\" or whatever. But who knows.",

I enjoy it even more when I get strong ARAM champs like Brand, ASol, Zyra, etc. but enjoy it way less when I or my teammates (whether intentionally or not) go into the match with useless champs. So, like you said: if there was a \"Howling Abyss\" mode where we could pick our own champions, most people will be inclined to optimize.

You don't need to be good at csing, you don't need to manage cool down windows that much, you don't need to think about waves etc. If you die, you get to respawn and keep playing. There's just little the enemy team can do to take advantage of a bad aram player other than repeatedly outplaying them, which is more difficult when 5 enemy champs are hiding under turret. Most aram players just exist until one of the nexus blows up. They have no concept of how to push a lead and win a game, it just happens occasionally.",

And they didn't even leave them in for customs.... \n\n\nThis is why I have 0 faith in riot to add more game modes, it's a surprise we even still have aram (I guess it's just popular enough)",

I believe Eternal Return still has a decent following going.",

I\u2019m at that point too, I just absolutely hate last hitting minions and putting soooo much emphasis on farm. When I play summoners rift I have to constantly think where can I get more farm? Does my team need me or do I farm? Farm farm farm farm. \n\nThis led me to aram which is absolutely fun, I mean no emphasis on farming. Just team fights! It\u2019s absolutely fun but like you said the random champ just sucks so much. I also get champs I don\u2019t wanna play but I have to power through. \n\nI think a game mode that is like aram but you get some control over your team comp or even get to select your own champ would be really fun.  I think it will actually be so fun that the majority of players play that game mode more over normal sr. \n\nPraying that this new 2v2 game mode isn\u2019t just a farming simulator like sr",

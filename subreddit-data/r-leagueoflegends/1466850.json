That's not a bad price to pay if you have to call another player to help fix your wave because you can't do it on your own, because the jungler has their own game to play as well.\n\nIf you're a jungle player you know that it feels really bad if you have to \"unnecessarily\" show yourself on the map if your jungle camps have respawned because if the opponent takes your camps while you're essentially doing nothing on the map except pushing out a wave or two and getting almost nothing for it, then that feels super terrible if you recall to base and come back to an empty jungle quarter.",

Unfortunately, the next wave is a cannon wave and it met on your side, so it's slow pushing into the enemy.  \nIn this case you lose fewer minions if you immediately recall than if you try to hardpush, since the enemy will come back before you get the wave under turret and you'll be forced to recall on a frozen wave(since you're low).\n\nThat's why I call it my \"bad habit\", since there are situations where I know I won't be able to crash, but have too much of an ego to cut my losses and end up having to recall anyway on a frozen wave, leading me to lose even more minions.",

Then the whole team turns on the ADC because supports are never held responsible for bot lane's outcome. \n\nSame is true of supports. No worse feeling than trying to fight when your ADC isn't on the same page or they want to fight and you have to spam back ping because you know jungler is coming. Nothing worse than warding perfectly for an objective and then your team decides let's give up all control of the objective for no reason...\n\nBot lane is the duo-or-die role.

            "comment": "Probably because it's the most variable/frustrating lane to play without a duo.\n\nIf you play any other lane, imagine the times when someone else on your team showed up and died to your opponent without netting you anything or even costing you resources. Not only is it frustrating and makes the lane harder/impossible but it usually happens at times that make you wonder \"why were you here in the first place?\" Playing bot lane is like having that as a constant possibility.\n\nPart of the problem is that while botlane is strong as a set of roles and a lane in terms of its proximity to dragons, it rarely feels like you are the one who determines your strength while also feeling like you need to be disproportionately strong to compete with any of the other lanes. Obviously, the degree of agency scales with the player's skill so a Challenger ADC/Support will utilize what they do have more effectively. The flipside to that is those ADCs/Supports also have significantly better teammates that enable them to do so.\n\nThe other, and arguably, bigger part of the problem is botlane is made of two roles (usually played with strangers) that have such a drastically different experience of the game at all points.\n\nADCs are gold/item dependent champions that generally have weaker base damages on their abilities. Being slightly ahead in-lane as an ADC MIGHT feel like you're on par with the other 3 lanes. Being slightly behind in-lane as an ADC feels like your opponent is miles ahead. And when you get behind, you will spend the entire game fighting your team for resources to catch up. Playing ADC is literally the only time I've played games where me and my counter-part on the enemy team were the weakest parts of our team and there was nothing, by that point, we could do about it. It becomes practically an unspoken agreement to just let each other farm if we happen to meet in a sidelane. It doesn't help that solo queue players want to act in the timeline where they feel strongest and that is almost always before the ADC wants to unless they've been handed a fair number of kills. It's the role that can feel the most miserable to play even if your team is winning.\n\nSupports have a wider range of experiences because of how many class/subclasses get played. As an Enchanter, you rarely feel behind in terms of being useful but you end up in situations where you know you'd be more useful anywhere else but you also know, based on how they've played, that your ADC will die and blame you if you leave. There are also times that you know, with almost 100% certainty, that you cannot save them if a fight starts but also know that they don't have the presence of mind to realize you living is more valueable than the warm and fuzzies they get from you trying to save them and dying. Engage/peel champs are strange. When you are ahead, you feel like God on cocaine. The problem is that you're also item dependent for tankiness. While you're still useful for CC, being behind feels like a knife edge where you have to clutch everything or you die every fight.\n\nI'm giving damage and mage supports their own spot because they're weirdly divisive and they have probably the most unique experience. Pyke feels great when ahead and okay when behind because he has useful CC and his ult always provides opportunity. Senna definitely can feel bad when behind but it has the silver-lining of knowing there isn't much opponents can actually do to stop you from catching up if the game goes on long enough. Mage supports, and by that I mean played with the intent of supporting, and not that stupid \"hurr durr, I'm a carry\" thing that lost midlaners do, feel the best and...most like a support...when ahead. You have the damage to create space and safety for your ADC to farm while getting the enemy into easy kill range for them. They also feel pretty good from behind. They have solid base damages, AP on economy items is pretty decent, and they provide a moderate amount of soft/hard CC. The issue with being behind is there's always that gremlin in the back of your head that's saying \"If you'd taken/take that kill/cs...you could get us back in the game.\" Maybe but not usually, and always at the expense of the ADC. Good supports ignore the gremlin and be useful. Bad supports high-five the gremlin and choose to make the game absolutely miserable for their ADC for a chance at winning.",

ADC shine in team-fights and things aren't much better (in SoloQ), everyone plays for themselves and a single mistake usually means instant death. \n\nThe role is really punishing and somewhat boring, but it's considered broken by most because of pro-play and how snowbally the lane can be.",

Instead it uses YouTube's platform and you can see the entire length which makes VOD's rather pointless unless it's a full series.",

Seems like a hub for viewing all of the games from across all your leagues in one convenient spot would be something that could drive viewership growth and foster interest in your various leagues if it, you know, worked.\n\n(And I don't think the \"PR nightmare\" of the sexual harassment thing is comparable to the client being shitty, at all. No one outside of Reddit and Twitter know or care about the sexual harassment thing. You think the Chinese playerbase gives a shit about sexual harassment in some American company? They just load the client and play the game. All the \"bad PR\" from that scandal lost Riot zero players. Literally no one cares. The client being a piece of shit is vastly more important to players. People actually will find another game if they can't reliably play this one. They're not quitting the game because some dudes at Riot like to fart in each others' faces. It cost Tencent a couple bucks, it didn't cost them any players.)",

All it did was cost them money, so why put effort into it?",

And when you remove the bullshit design clutter and reduce stuff down to basic text and good search functionality, then you give the best possible product. Any glitter you want to put on top of that needs to be done without harming the functionality of the site.\n\nLoLesports is a website whose only real value is inform people of the schedule of games. However, Riot has failed miserably to convey that information with the website as efficiently as possible. They're not even close to conveying that info as efficiently as possible. The wiki pages from third parties do a MUCH better job at it, but I'd argue that even those sites aren't as good as it could be.",

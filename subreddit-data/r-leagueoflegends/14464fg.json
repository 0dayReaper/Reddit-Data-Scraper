A tank like Poppy, a bruiser like Darius, or someone with dashes/blinks like Zed.\n\nThe cost for poor positioning is definitely greater for ADCs, though, who have to actively enter danger to contribute, while squishy supports can usually hover around the edge, assuming their team is playing front to back.\n\nYuumi got the counterplay for enchanters (which is to quickly delete them since they have no stats but can add huge stats to others) completely removed. Enchanters do require *some* measure of awareness/skill (ofc so does every role).\n\nYuumi is the literal stereotype of what people think enchanters are. No awareness or skill required. It might help, sure, but the price of inefficient play is minimal because you're always out of the fight unless your *host* misplays egregiously.",

You needed to take advantage of her ability to trade absurdly well levels 1-2 thanks to her old passive and get good at detaching in mid-late game team fights to proc your passive and body block skill shots while never getting hit by any stray cc because you\u2019ll die instantly. If all you did on old yuumi was hop on one person and never detach you weren\u2019t playing her even close to her full potential. New yuumi is much more of an abomination imo, because she requires doing much less for more reward.",

You make all those *exact same decisions*, choosing when to pressure with an auto, make use of your passive, and body block shots and damage for your ADC while also having to independently manage your own position and HP bar. Yuumi has the advantage in all of those situations because she's right next to the other person fighting in the lane, and can juke when she gets low, becoming un-targetable. \n\nYuumi's real difficulty is in warding, vision control, and roaming. Things your ADC isn't going to want to participate in, but you have to do anyway because trading in lane isn't the only thing a support is supposed to do - but Yuumi's not a real character by herself. In all of those trading situations, Yuumi had an *advantage* over a standard support, and that's what pro players are pushing.\n\nThe \"mastery\" of Yuumi is just realizing that you can't always be a blob and have to actually do things ... it's a bit of a hard sell that that's real skill and not just adjusting to the weirdness of Yuumi.",

What ends up happening is that Yuumi becomes even more pro play skewed and she needs to be nerfed even more, making her worse in solo queue just to be balanced in pro play. Instead of the playerbase being happy they cry about their champion being gutted for casuals. Does this sound familiar? It should because it's literally what happened every single time riot buffed Yuumi's passive - aka the skill expressive part of her kit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you promote the AFK style of Yuumi, at least she can be played in solo queue. If you promote the proactive Yuumi, she's horrible in solo queue but godly in pro play.",

A lot of Yuumi's power was gated behind hopping off and autoing, which pro yuumi's do really well, and average yuumi's do poorly. Thus, in order to shift her power from pro play to average play, they removed that. In theory, this means that the gap between pro and average is smaller (because now her power should be in places that average players are relatively better at accessing), and so you can have yuumi at 50% winrate for average players without pro presence. Its solid theory, they just need to pull some more balance levers to get there.",

Historically; he's been fine as high as 55%~56% for long periods. Why? Because when he is picked:\n\n1: He's picked into situations where his niche excels *and he is expected to win*\n\n2: People who pick Rammus usually know how to use Rammus.\n\n3: Due to his unpopularity; a lot of people don't really know how to fight Rammus.\n\nContrast Ezreal; who frequently gets nerfed at 48~49% because he is stupid popular; while his winrate is also dragged down by people bad with him, building the wrong items on him [or the wrong items in the wrong situations], and him being so popular people know how to fight him because they do it often.\n\nA champion isn't gonna get nerfed because they have a 100% winrate in pro if they were picked twice as a counterpick.\n\nHell; at one point Riot said they were gonna rework Yasuo because of his *banrate*. This never happened however and instead became Yone; who Riot outright said was a \"Yasuo Echo Fighter\" to \"give the Yasuo players something to play when Yasuo is banned\".",

The problem is Riot wants her to be a good \"beginner pick\", but nerfing her out of pro play makes her a terrible beginner pick because she's too underwhelming. And if you make her switch between targetable and untargetable while using abilities, she now has way more mechanical skill and decision making needed to be effective. Which ruins the beginner identity. That's why she's the ultimate all or nothing lol. There's no way to balance around a kit based on a mechanic that is so 100% or 0%.",

A champ with high presence in pro play needs to be nerfed significantly for pros to stop playing it because they've already put so much time into getting good at it, building comps with it, etc. It's why people are still defaulting to Azir, Wukong, Vi, Jayce, etc despite all of them receiving pro play focused tuning.\n\nA second problem, for specifically Yuumi and Lulu, is how good they are with Zeri. As long as Zeri is still a pro-pick, Yuumi will be good because their synergy is Xayah/Rakan levels. I think if you nerf Zeri to oblivion Yuumi will fall out of pro play naturally with minimal tuning.",

We're talking 60-70% win rates and left that way for MONTHS AND MONTHS while bans were controlled by a single person on your team.\n\nTake akali rework on release, give her across the board buffs to literally everything (damage, healing, durability, MS, CD, etc), leave her in that state for months, and you've got an idea of what hots balancing was like.",

Man could show up to map objectives with his possess while farming xp in the far lane bush. You'd be on Blackheart Bay jockeying the turn in for 3 minutes and come out 2 levels up with the topside turret dead because Abathur was just slow pushing it the entire time while still contributing.  He was NUTS unless you didn't have a character for him to buff up on your team. People picked ults specifically to hunt and kill Abathur because if you let him exist outside of his base wall you'd lose the game.\n\nWant to point out the Irony that Abathur remains significantly more interactive than Yuumi ever has been, by the way. High skill expression macro support play where taking risks and exposing your extremely weak self to potential punishment is rewarded correctly by providing benefit you otherwise wouldn't to your team.",

This meant that if like an assassin found his body in a bush and killed him while he was stuck to the marksman, he blinked out. A similar concept could be done with Yuumi, though they could give it a fairly large range similar to TF's R so that she can cover a wider area, but can't just globally go wherever she pleases by bouncing between champions.",

If Abathur had to continuously move his body to keep his hat where the action would be, that would mean he'd have to progressively keep scooting towards enemy territory, which would make him vulnerable. On top of that, it would prevent the hat from zipping from unit to unit if they were out of range, and possibly even require the hat to return to the body if the host was killed, effectively removing them from combat and turning what was a 3v2 to a 1v2.",

Always honor level 5, even got the Santa Baron and some others icons for being top 20% honorable before honor system was introduced. And I was always a bit chippy and toxic, yet I've never gotten a single ban/chat restriction, not once in 12 years. Come year 13, I've been repeatedly chat restricted, last thing typed were lyrics to a gay version of Slipknot's Psychosocial song, and for a whole month this time. I realize that previous years I was toxic only towards other people, Summoners if you will. But starting this year I went after the game itself and the way Riot is managing it. It's simple to blame your teammate for going 0/5, but /allchatting that his lane opponent is unhealthy for the game is the most I've chatted about. Riot is forcing different champions every patch, making them S tier, and one ban is simply not enough for the majority of matches. Their ranked system is flawed, it's always a coin flip for me as a support - I either get carried or they carry me, and it's always someone abusing the meta, or a higher ranked player smurfing the game. Stating the obvious here, but why come down on a simple player expressing this in a chatbox \\*\\*in your game\\*\\*? Why is it that this bothers them so much?  \n\n\nRiot wants to shut you up.",

Not even talking about pro, there isn't a single champ in the game I hate seeing more than Yuumi, regardless of which team she's on or how strong she is. The fact that someone can possibly win a game with such little effort instantly tilts me whenever she's picked. I know I've got the Garen flair and \"hurr durr spin2win faceroll champ\" or whatever, but what I enjoy about playing Garen is finding different ways to use his extremely basic kit to overcome all the crazy shit in this game, and at the very least you have to pay some form of attention to where your character is on the screen.\n\nI don't know why Riot wants to make Yuumi a \"new player champ\" either - does anyone really think that playing Yuumi is going to be a proper introduction to playing LoL, and if they do can I have some of what they're smoking? Yuumi straight up removes the need to pay attention to your own positioning, which is an important part of playing literally every champion besides Yuumi. And after playing with some \"Yuumi mains\" when they're on another champ, you can tell they never learned to play League as a real champion because they do not look at their own positioning at all. When you play Yuumi you're playing like half of the game, and I don't understand why a champ that does that is being branded as something meant for new players. If you tell a new player to start as a support they already do not learn to last hit, and with Yuumi Riot is saying they shouldn't learn to move either.\n\nPersonally, whenever I've introduced a new player to this game I always tell them to start as an ADC because it allows them to learn the fundamentals of positioning and last hitting without having to think about more abstract concepts like jungle pathing or roaming. You also rely on your team a lot more as an ADC than other roles and usually don't have to take the initiative, which takes a lot of difficult decision making off the shoulders of someone just trying to learn the basics. I would never tell a new player to start with Yuumi, not only because I despise the champion's very existence, but also because it does not actually teach them anything about the game. I know there will be people who disagree with this and have their own preferred method of introducing people to the game, but I hope we can all agree that playing a champion that simply ignores core game mechanics like Yuumi is a terrible way to do it.\n\nTL;DR Yuumi is an abomination and completely fails Riot's stated intentions of being a \"new player champion\" because she prevents new players from learning anything besides pressing their abilities.",

            "comment": "Dude, I\u2019ve been saying this ENTIRE time, this rework had no intention of doing that, it just made her what everyone THOUGHT she was. Old Yummi, yeah W was her main thing, but she HAD to stop using it if she wanted to be good. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nWith Old Passive, You HAVE to auto attack(implying recasting w) to get a shield for your Ally AND regain mana. The counter play, is that if you can catch her out while she\u2019s reaching for that auto, you can cc her, stopping her from using her W for 5 secs.\nWith New Passive you just stay on ONE person, their your best friend. You do anything else unless they\u2019re dead, you\u2019re throwing.\n\nOld Q and New Q is like whatever, they don\u2019t change her gameplay that much, they just made it more like Vex Q, but you can direct the direction after it\u2019s cast, which makes it A LOT harder to doge, but then being on your BEST FRIEND, makes it so MORE damage and SLOW.\n\nOld W Gave adaptive force, so like she\u2019s still technically doing consistent damage, so that\u2019s fine. New W, is JUST for her passive, which BEST FRIEND BONUS just makes her heal harder on that ONE PERSON.\n\nOld E, a pretty sizable E, that took a PERCENTAGE of your Mana, which, guess what? incentivized you to use your old passive, so once again, you were FORCED to HOP OFF to get benefitted. New E? Just turns it into a shield, which is worse than a heal, but it doesn\u2019t matter because new W just HEALS PASSIVELY, and even if it did, the new E also REFUNDS MANA REGENERATION on your W\u2019ed ally GIVES ATTACK SPEED, like WHY.\n\nOld R, an ability you have to aim, hit a target 3 times to root them, and if you miss, or they get outa your R before the 3rd hit, oh well, guess you fudged it, so if it\u2019s strong when you hit it, it\u2019s fair right? NOPE because New R does that AND EVEN MORE, EASIER, it may be smaller sure,  it you can change its direction while it\u2019s going, every hit slows, so agreeably better than just 3rd hit root AND IT HEALS. And guess what? 130% effectiveness when on her best friend.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about gameplay styles now, yeah? \n\nOld Yuumi, was an agile Cat, who when need be, would get off her ally to proc her passive, or even to just jumped to another ally, at BOTH points she is vulnerable to damage and stuff, because she has an active hurt box when switching allies, so one accidentally bad switch during an AOE cc, dead. She had to choose the best time to switch allies, save her heal for the just enough speed boost to catch an enemy or the barely enough healing to save someone, aim her q, proc her passive for mana, because she had actual mana problems, and try to hit EVERYONE(which was most of the time 3 people in a team fight anyway because they were spread out) with her R, 3 TIMES, which was surprisingly hard because in this new Meta there are like, 100 blinks and dashes, even Melees could tank like 2 hits and walk behind her or her attached ally, and it\u2019d be ineffective STILL. The skill gap between a good and bad Yuumi was HUGE because if people just Stayed on an ally the whole game, you lost SO MUCH VALUE of the character, because she was designed to be, for lack of better words, an Active Background Character, like my boy Kirishima from BNHA. Speaking of just staying on an ally for the whole game\u2026 \n\nNew Yuumi gameplay, just be on your best friend and profit, no switching, because you lose value, no getting off because you lose value, just press all your abilities because the shied is alaways beneficial because Attack Speed is always beneficial, and if not the Mana Regen definitely is, and just press R the moment a team fight starts, you can change it\u2019s direction anyway and you passively heal now so it\u2019s like I guess you don\u2019t need to worry about your bestie\u2019s survival. Now she really CAN win by just staying on one person.\n\nThe Yuumi rework wasn\u2019t about making her better, it was about making her what everyone else from the OUTSIDE in, THOUGHT she was.\n\nTL;DR Yuumi used to have an actual Skill Floor and Ceiling, because she was forced to do things besides sit on one person, now sitting on one person is the ONLY thing she needs to do.",

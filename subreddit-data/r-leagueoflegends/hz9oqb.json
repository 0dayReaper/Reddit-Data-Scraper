Randuin's will reduce the physical and magic crit damage, as well as Yone's attack speed. Think Corki, but instead of 80/20 it's 75/25. Adaptive Helm will further reduce all of Yone's magic damage by... whatever the modifier is. Tabis will reduce the on-hit damage regardless of type. The only challenge is for Ornn and Maokai, champions that have specific tank items they want to build which aren't the two above. Poppy and Sion are set. \n\nGraves and all his Death's Dance+Mercs building friends are gonna have a bad time. Support tanks (Stoneplate, Knight's Vow, etc.) are going to need to take Tenacity runes and go Tabis. Kai'Sa and Ezreal are more vulnerable than usual. Sylas, Morde, and any of the AP off-tanks are going to hate Yone, especially if they wanted Sorcs.",

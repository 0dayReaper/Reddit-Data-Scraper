Actually the first match was won by Kasparov, then he lost in rematch against improved DeeperBlue. But that loss was actually because of one stupid move made by algorithm.\n\nKasparov knew the computer is smart, but he could see the logic behind it. That's how he won first match, being able to adapt his game to play on machine weak points. In first game of rematch however computer got glitch and just made a random move, with no real strategy behind it.\n\nKasparov however didn't know that. He saw a move that he couldn't understand. He thought it's a move beyond his logic. Something so intelligent he's not able to understand. \"A computer couldn't be so stupid to do such a nonsense move\". A move, that was basically made by computer that glitched and had no idea what is it doing. \n\nThis caused Kasparov to mental boom, he lost games he could still win. Eventually he got defeated, resulting with this big news.\n\n\n\nAnd this clip slightly resembles that. \"Enemies cannot be this stupid to actually set a trap here\". However the result is getting physical advantage with gold and exp. And a bit of tilt for victims. All because of incorrect assumption.",

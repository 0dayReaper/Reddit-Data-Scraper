    "postText": "Why on earth is karthus adc not nerfed? This abomination has been sitting at a 54%+ winrate forever now and the only reason it seems to avoid nerfs is the fact that no one plays it. Whats the deal? \n\nHe is insanely OP in the early game, and scales insanely hard too. Even if hes not fed he does the most damage in the game by far. How is he escaping nerfs?",

The playrate difference is like a few percent between jungle and adc anyways. \n\nIt\u2019s not like we need to entirely forget about the fac that *he gets played in adc too* purely because his winrate in another role isnt as good.\n\nLike\u2026 \u201coh guys look! Talon jungle is really OP rn, but we can\u2019t nerf it because talon midlane isn\u2019t as good!\u201d. I don\u2019t understand how that\u2019s even an argument. \n\nWhy are we even pretending like his purely a mid/jungler anyways? He\u2019s only picked by karthus mains in whatever role, and it\u2019s blatantly obvious that he is way too strong in adc. \n\nLeague of graphs says literally 1/3 of all of his games appear in ADC. 10% of his games are midlane. So don\u2019t act like karthus midlane is his intended role (which btw also has a 51% winrate, and is hardly in a weak position) and use that as a reason for avoiding adc nerfs.\n\nAnd just a reminder, his winrate goes up as you look at higher elos. So\u2026 good players are abusing something really OP? Why not nerf it? And if he *really* is that bad with a nerf in his \u201cintended role\u201d, then just adjust him and his kit. \n\nHis clearly problematic, saying his winrate in one of the many roles that he flexes into would suffer after a nerf isn\u2019t really an argument to not nerf him.",

And the whole \u201clow playrate\u201d just means his winrate isn\u2019t getting tanked by Joe schmoe first timing it and playing it poorly.\n\nIf you want a champion who *actually* is bad while having a low playrate, look at ryze over the years. Low pickrate, low winrate. If he gets picked more (by people that don\u2019t know how to play him) it\u2019ll drop *even more*. \n\nBut karthus? He\u2019s got +7% winrate over Ryze with basically the same exact playrate (1.4% on karthus vs 1.3% on ryze). Both champions are only played by the mains of those champions, and their winrates are MASSIVELY far apart. Does it not scream karthus being overtuned?",

    "postText": "Hey fellow summoners. I have been playing with my friends this month trying to win some rank games as a team of five or 3 in flex. Want to know how I can help us win.\n\nBut we are just not winning any game. I main support and my friends played fine. \n\nBut two of my friends are quite opinionated and they don\u2019t back down when they are arguing over small things like \u201cHad you done that I would have done that then we would have won that skirmish!\u201d, \u201cwhere are you guys I have been fighting 3 ppl for a minute straight! Where is my reinforcement?\u201d, or \u201cwhy are you pushing lane when we are doing baron?\u201d Sometimes I think I am playing solo queue. \n\nFriend A: he plays this game for a long time and he is quite a good laner. Has a lot of experience fighting different champion. Crush his lane 7/10 but he is very gank prone. He loses most of his fight because of 2v1 ganks. He is very aggressive and once a fight starts he never retreat and he told us that\u2019s his style so expect all-in when we engage with him. He can crush the enemy if he is ahead but inting quite hard when he is behind because of his fight style. (He prefer support to be a tank engage with tons of CC.) now he play as our jungler and he doesn\u2019t gank bot lane much and gank mid and top for herald. Which I think is a good call herald could provide a lot of early lead. But friend B as an adc is agitated by this. \n\nFriend B: he also plays this game for a long time. He is quite a good top, mid and adc. Also has a lot of knowledge about champions and their counters. He is less aggressive, know when to not fight and the importance of farming. Always try to call for attack or disengage. (He prefer enchanter support and think because it is enchanter meta I should pick enchanter)\n\nSometimes he will let us die because he think the fight is not a good idea, maybe he is right/wrong I don\u2019t know, all I know is an argument will ensue afterwards. \n\nAs you can see this creates the condition for constant arguments.\n\nBecause player A is always on the offensive and player B will sometimes not follow up because the fight is not smart or advantageous then the fight turned bad and they start arguing. Me and the other two friends (C and D) have to watch them argue while the morale is plummeting. They also argues which champ is countered by whom whether they should get adc fed early or get herald early for plates and tower. \n\nWhat can I do as a support to help us win? Should we follow up even tho the fight seems like a bad idea? Or should we trust my friends\u2019 instinct and follow him to the end? Right now we are constantly splitting into two group when a fight happens we don\u2019t play like a team. \n\n(P.S: we tried to put them bot lane as adc and support in a normal game for test. It was a disaster.)",

You can say that the call was bad(ideally after the game) but don't hold it against him.\n\nAnd the most important part is that everybody follows the call unless they have a solid reason to cancel the call (example being enemy having herald so you don't want to overload a site since you always lose the push vs herald).",

But he keeps improving and now he is consistently doin fine no more 0/3/0. And he can keep up his cs with enemy laner too. He doesn\u2019t blame anyone, hyper focus his own play and usually quite easy going so we just need to call him to tp because he doesn\u2019t know when and what he was supposed to be doing after landing phase. His macro is improving too. \n\nFriend D is similar to me. He just play with the flow keep the plan simple and don\u2019t make risky play. He is the better jungler in my opinion but A doesn\u2019t think so and wants to play as jungler so D is our mid laner. D is a decent mid laner but sometimes forgot to alert us enemy\u2019s mid laner is roaming.",

Try everyone shotcalling and see who works best, usually it's either the best/most experienced player or the support/jungler due to the nature of these roles. See who fits the shotcaller role best, stick with it and adapt. \n\nWhen we had our team playing in local tournaments, we ended up having a system where in the early game information would be told to me (jungler) on which I decided what I needed my lanes to do in order to contest/gank/etc. \n\nDuring mid and late game, we had two leading shotcallers (jungle and ADC) who were calling everything, even simple things like \"X push out bot while we hold mid\" or \"Y help me ward\". The others were more or less blindly following, being able to focus on their mechanics and openings. \n\nIt's a system that worked really well back during S7 meta and I think it's a universally applicable concept. Most important thing is that all of you stick to one plan, instead of some of you doing things on their own, which seems to be your problem, judging by the post.",

I personally opt for some gentle poking and prodding to get them to go in and have started just committing when they start going for an insane play (one of my friends plays Singed and has no business doing so). If I'm in a support role then sure we probably lose, but we might as well go for some fun plays while we still can.",

            "comment": "Without looking at what others have said yet... The mentality of both players are drastically different. Both have flaws, because despite Player A being a good player (according to what you wrote), he still ends up sabotaging himself due to ending up in 2v1's because of how aggressive he plays. Player B shouldn't just pretend he doesn't see player A taking a \"dumb\" fight and ignore him altogether. It would be nice if you could push them to find a middle ground here.\n\nHonestly I think these two players are just too different, and I can relate to player B as I also tend to be more passive and let others take the lead and not jump into any fight without reason. It will be stressful for this player to just bend to what Player A wants to do (which seems to be forcing fights, despite how bad they can be for the entire team). In the end league players suffer from infinite knowledge syndrome I feel, which means they always know better than someone else. That's why I don't think these two will see eye to eye soon (or at all). As example you mention how they don't agree with each other on who they should snowball.\n\nYou won't have fun or success with a disorganised group like this, there's no harmony, especially not with Player B outright refusing to help out if he deems the fight unwinnable. Player A's super aggressive and thoughtless playstyle is also very bad for your team. With players like these there will always be conflict/blaming going on.\n\nPlayer A's playstyle when he plays jungle is also weird. If he wants you to pick a tank support, it would make way more sense for him to sit botlane, so that he can snowball you guys (and himself) and pretty much have a higher chance of securing drakes.\n\nIf your friends bicker like this in a 5/3-man stack, you might as well go play soloqueue. It's the same, except you don't have to feel bad if you mute people. :(",

    "postText": "One of the criticisms of LCS is its failure of players and teams to use their $ to build their brand. While it is easier said than done to build a brand, doing so is important because ultimately that is what draws long term fan engagement, revenue, and even profit. There are plenty of teams in leagues around the world that have never found much competitive success but do relatively well financially because their fans care little about their performance.\n\nThe question then is: how could they have done so at a reasonable cost? \n\nSome ideas, most revolving around direct fan engagement and content creation:\n\n1. Teams make videos with players reactions/thoughts to upcoming/recent champion releases.\n\n2. Teams organizing 1v1 tournaments with fans or ARAMs between each other. This happens somewhat at e.g. MSI but could have been annual events for each team with team gear as prizes or funny trophies or whatever.\n\n3. \"Pro tips\" videos for how to play certain champions.\n\n4. \"Pro Perspectice\" videos walking players through parts of huge games to explain what they were thinking etc.\n\n5. LOL developmental bootcamps organized by teams.\n\nWhile these all demand player time, the idea is that most of the time costs of coordination, writing,and whatnot would could be borne by non-player professionals in most cases.",

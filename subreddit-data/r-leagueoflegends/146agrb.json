    "postText": "[https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/summoner/euw/Julian309](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/summoner/euw/Julian309)\n\nI've recently had this yorick player in my game, and he did alright nothing that surprised me and I didn't pay any attention to him at all. My friend though was in the same game as me and thought his gameplay seemed off. \n\nLittle did we know this man has one of the worst kennen's in the game's history, I'm not making fun of him or insulting him, this is merely looking at the stats on his profile.\n\nBut that's not a one off thing, it's for ALL the champions he played, he racks up a whopping top 0.1% WORST cs numbers I have ever seen consistently. \n\nBut it looks like this player had an epiphany 30ish days ago when suddenly his gameplay totally changed, he wasn't incredible, an average silver but still now he does consistently OVER 100cs. \n\nFor you and I (I hope) that's not much at all BUT something particular is that his games on average last  almost always below 20 minutes. Not only that but 2 months ago if you looked at the games he played only judging the champions it looks like this man is playing a whole other game. a corki jungle there, a vayne and lucian supports here... picks like that aren't 1 in 100 but consistent across all of his games with no exception, with the example I just gave you happening in the same game.\n\nPlease explain to me what happened I am genuinely intrigued by what this player is doing and how in the hell he even made it to silver",

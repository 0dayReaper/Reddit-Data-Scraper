It\u2019s a MOBA legend. Marc Merrill was a Dark Lord of the MOBA genre, so powerful and so wise he could use League of Legends to influence esports\u2026 He had such a knowledge of MOBAs that he could even keep the ones he cared about from going over to DOTA. The dark side of League of Legends is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice switched games. Ironic. He could save others from DOTA, but not himself.\n",

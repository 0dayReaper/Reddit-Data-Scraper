In League micro play and skill comes from piloting your champion and adapting to the enemy team's comp and builds. Being able to execute a flashy play on Zed by knowing exactly when to do what is what skill is in League. Dota is a lot more macro based game. Big APM plays come from out of the box plays more than playing the heros' \"intended\" mechanics. Not to say that you can't make insane mechanical plays in Dota, but it's a lot more limited with slow turning rates, slower movement speeds, longer cast times and slow ass projectile speeds.",

But the mechanics that demand the apm aren\u2019t the same. The few ranged carries (except arc warden) are lower apm than adcs for sure. \n\nBut other skills like controlling multiple units, or dodging using spells/actives/vision is way more prevalent. Heroes like puck or the spirits are probably the best examples of heroes that have to make plays like zed and are balanced around that.  \n\nEven slower projectiles doesn\u2019t actually lower the apm when there\u2019s so many ways to dodge/disjoint that it becomes a required skill. Stuff that in league ends up requiring prediction or preemptive caution is now something you need to wait for and make a play",

Anyone mind explaining what's going on to someone who doesn't play this game?\n\nI see the guy's buying stuff to revive himself, and it looks like one of his enemies dies, but the other two stay alive.  At one point it looks like he turns invisible and walks to where the fountain is.  Is the goal to touch the fountain or something?",

You can only buy items if you're at your team's fountain, and while it's good to buy items as fast as possible, it's almost never seen together with actual plays in the game because, if you reach that situation, then you're probably about to lose the game anyways.

Just play norms, learn your champs, learn the basics watching your mini map, cs'ing, vision. Learn your main few champs inside and out. Not sure what role you play, but they all have little things that can win you the game. Like bot lane and drags or top and rift. \n\nPlay without the pressure of that loss being tilting. Just play norms, improve and go back to ranked when you seem to have gotten what you think you need. If it goes south then no biggie, go back to norms and practice what you need to(learning what you need to improve on and making that specific effort is one of the biggest tips for improving)\n\nPlay for fun, then play for rank when that will be fun. And if it all gets too tilting, play a couple arams and get back to it, arams let you learn a lot of champs. Both what you can do and what to do against them. And there's no stakes, just fun.",

While high apm nets you smooth movement in League, in StarCraft the higher your APM the more resources you can manage simultaneously. Apm is actually considered by many in the SC2 community to be a 3rd resource. In League technically you could make pro with an apm average of 40-60 if you use them well.",

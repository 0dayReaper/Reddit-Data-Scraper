    "postText": "Fizz E which by the way consumes a huge part of Fizz kit power budget only lasts 0.75 seconds.\n\nDuskblade passive untargetable lasts 1.5 seconds.   This just seems wrong.  The stealth passive on Duskblade was bad for the game but this isn't any better.  Most champs aren't balanced around having access to untargetable.  I think it should be changed to how Senna E works.  Basically if your close enough you can hit them and they can still get hit by skill shots but they're protected from auto attacks and targeted spells unless an ally is standing very close to them.",

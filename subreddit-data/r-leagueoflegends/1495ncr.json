    "postText": "They have nerfed almost every other hybrid champion in the game, but somehow the absolute least fun to play against playstyle has not only made it out unharmed but is getting buffs constantly? Has anybody at Riot ever played against AP Shaco?? Is Synapse bribing Riot so he can put more PinkWard plays into his montages?\n\nEvery patch Shaco is among the top ~15 most banned champs, despite being never above B-tier in terms of Win- or Pick-Rate. That is because people would rather lose the game than play against a shaco. I dont even know what I'm supposed to do against his clones+boxes as a melee champ, just close my eyes and go to my happy place?",

Besides, if you have knockback, it's easy to throw him away and then kill him. Not to forget that you can quickly clear the boxes that spawn after the ult.\n\nYes, you will rarely kill AP Shaco. If he doesn't want to, you have almost no chance. So, you have to stop to play for kills on him and play for something else.

If you see Shaco at 50 hp and you don't have any ranged ability to kill him - don't try. If he stays, he got a plan. If he goes base nearby, he got a plan. If you think you can ambush him - he probably got a plan. If you simply ignore his existence and only care for box placements, you win lane every time.",

If Shaco vanishes, just think what position would be the best for him. 99% of times he will appear there.\n\nHis W literaly requires you to walki into it. You should never chase Shaco as this is probalby the thing he wants you to do. Either nuke him or leave him.\n\nPink wards and red trinket also help a lot, especially now that red trinket has charges. Simply don't walk around unchecked territory.\n\nHis R is interesting to play around too. Many skills that mark champion don't copy. Examples: \n\n* Rek'Sai has that mark that allows her to use R. If you attack Shaco before, only original Shaco will have it.\n* AoE follows like Viktor's R or Udyr's P+R will continue to follow original Shaco.\n* Vi, Vayne, Gnar etc.\n* DoTs like ignite, Brand/Lillia P, Teemo E, Cass Q/W, Liandry or Demonic will also tell you which one is real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo sum up, Shaco's skillset is all about outplays, but that works both ways. If you don't allow Shaco to outplay you, the only thing good in his kit is Flash on Q.",

If ur AD ur only gonna score picks if the enemy ignores your gank angles. compare shaco to any assassin, where they can run you down and kill you if they are ahead.",

People find him unfair because isolating a person and working on them is very easy in the chaotic shit show that is called soloq.

Still annoying as fuck to play against, and getting feared by his clone or boxes literally has no counterplay if you\u2019re melee. Of course, that comes at the cost of having Shaco on your team. \n\nI perma-ban him simply because he\u2019s annoying as fuck to play against and it really does suck to have lanes lose because of invisible ganks.",

Look at Nunu, Zac or Amumu. They all got much much better ganks and can do a lvl 2 gank equally as good if not even better. They also all don't need a lot of gold income to be relevant.",

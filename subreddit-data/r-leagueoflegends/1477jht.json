So many poor emotional states are parasitically linked to specific habits (drinking, smoking, video games) and if you feel you are having trouble quitting (which is an addiction), you can seek a professional to help you.  \n\nThe key here is you feel you can't quit.  You can do any number of things (there are programs to keep you from reinstalling), but the best thing you can do is get yourself the tools to extract yourself from these situations should you pick up something else in the future that induces the same rage/addiction state League does.\n\nTherapy takes time and money, so there are valid reasons to use it as a last resort, but it can help you.",

Some people get it in their head that once you go into therapy you'll be there for years or get permanently on pills.  This is honestly something you'll walk into the first session, explain your problem, they'll give you some techniques, and then bada bing bada boom after a like 3-4 sessions and depending on how you feel you'll be done.  Not all therapy has to be years worth of counseling.",

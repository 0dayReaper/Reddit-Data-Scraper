If you have less than 0.5s CD left you can actually start your EQ and the Q will cast at the end even thoough its technically still on CD. That way if you perfectly EQ on different targets your Q CD is 0.83s.\n\n The knock up lasts 1s, which means with perfect timing you have a 0.17s window to auto attack aswell. Which means EQ on one target, AA, EQ a different target and R. \n\nYou dont have to wait for your EQ to finish, similar how you can EQ flash EQ R also works. The spin Q will follow his ultimate. \n\nThis mechanic is key for good Yasuos because it obviously works with way lower attack speed if someone else sets him up. Say an Alistar gets the knock up and Yasuo has access to creeps. He can simply EQ while Ali knocks up and gets an extra Q in during his ult.\n\nIts especially good because normally his R resets his Q stacks. With that mechanic the Q comes out during R and doesnt get reset. Meaning he gets Q1 at the beginning of his R, Q2 after his ult ends and then after 1.33s CD he can knock up again.",

Once I figured that out I got better at a whole bunch of other top-laners too, like Renekton.",

While most people will never get to be as good as the guy on the video, you will definitely improve a lot just by playing. I few years ago I had a breakthrough moment when I realized I was actually supposed to manage and kill preferably with autoattacks every minion. I remember thinking wtf really? That's pretty insane! Or managing Sona's passive (you use 3 abilities and the next auto attack has an extra effect depending what was the last ability you did). I thought that was really hard to try manage and use in an intended way. Or lane positions, like what's best where and why.\n\nAll of these and much more took me a while to figure out. These days they're all second nature and not only I can do them all without thinking, I can also immediately see if my opponent is at a level where he can do the same and exploit that to my advantage. Sometimes is just the extra autoattack weaving between abilities. Sometimes is the positioning, sometimes is the mechanics, etc.\n\nWhat also helped me a lot was, after understanding the core mechanics common to every champ in the game, was not sticking with the same champ over and over. Playing different champions just to understand how they work improved my gameplay a ton. You don't need to master them or anything but only seeing other people playing them limits what you learn. Playing with gives you a feel for what they do, what they combo with, what are they trying to take advantage of (are they waiting for you to be near a wall, etc), a feel for their cooldown windows (if they waste an ability you can take advantage of the fact he doesn't have it for a few seconds), etc. \nBy the way, ARAM games are great for this. They force you into playing something that you probably wouldn't in a scenario where farming doesn't matter much. It's also compact so you get to practice mechanical skills like dodging a lot. I love it.\n\nSorry for the text wall! Last protip, /mute all is a thing and don't be afraid to use it! The chat can be a cesspool more frequently than I'd like.",

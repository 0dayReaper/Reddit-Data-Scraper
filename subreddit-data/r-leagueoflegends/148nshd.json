There is just no way a pro is e'ing from fog in q range to melee the baron garen with 3 levels on him who can just silence ez before ez is able to take even 25% of his health. Unless he thinks he has a window because garen is in e and doesnt know garen can stop e, and doesnt expect senna ult. But i strongly doubt this. Im thinking he meant to click w q over wall, hands were on wrong keys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOption 2 is he is tilted as fuck because he is smorfin this game, but the rest of his team is underperforming and they lose baron. So he just says fuck it im e'ing in and the game is over either way\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Theres always a third option. Food delivery prio, someone was knocking on his door",

Like there is no way they can actually catch up to you but they keep running at you anyways just long enough to make the entire exchange awkward. I see it mostly in top lane against Darius mains. It can also be seen in champs like Warwick, Garen, and Olaf. Low mobility gigachad champs that are probably just praying you fight them so they just keep running at you.",

They just die and the one chasing probably healed back to full anyway.",

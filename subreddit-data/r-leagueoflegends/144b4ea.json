For instance, I'm about 600km from those fires, and the air smelled like fire for multiple days...\n\nAnd I understand that US news primarily cover US cities, and that NYC, being a very poular city, leads to more reports when something wild happens there (and air quality being even lower than normal, especially drastically so, would qualify).\n\nIt's still funny/weird to see more \"**Look at how much smoke there is in the US**\" reports than \"**Here's what's happening in the north, leading to all that smoke in the US**\".",

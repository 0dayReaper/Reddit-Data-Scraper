Look up tutorials on youtube on attack moving/attack animation cancelling also called orbwalking (old dota term) \n\nThere are other uses besides animation cancels. For instance if you are entering a bush with a move cmd and an enemy attacks you you will keep walking while they hit you. Enter a bush with a atk move cmd and you will attack them as soon as they become visible.",

It also makes it easier for you to attack while running away as you don't need to move your mouse back across and can instead do move back-&gt;attack move-&gt;move back without having to input precise clicks\n\nYou also need to go to Game -&gt; Gameplay -&gt; Attack Move on Cursor so that it makes the attack be issued on nearest target to your cursor instead of nearest target to your champion",

This is the reason why people thought for a very short time that Doublelift had good mechanics until people realize that he took this shortcut to reduce input. All the enemy had to do is throw a ward in front of you and you'd be wasting autos.",

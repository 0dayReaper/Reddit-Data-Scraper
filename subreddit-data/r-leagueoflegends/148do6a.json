    "postText": "(Scroll down for my Solution if you want to skip over me discussing Yuumi in general)\n\nSince her release, Yuumi has always been controversial. Often being labeled a toxic champ for soloQ and being pick/ban in pro play for seasons, she definitely seems problematic to the game. Because of this (and because I got a bunch of time on my hands right now), I decided to give balancing (nerfing) her a shot.\n\nBefore, it may make sense to note that I studied game designed and wrote my final thesis on combat balancing. I'm not experienced, but I do have some idea of what I do.\n\nFirst of, I tried to analyze what the issue with Yuumi is. Most players usually complain about her design being out of place in league and her being untouchable is a horrible design choice. I only partially agree with this. I think, that for a game of League's size, it's important to feature champs like Yuumi that are great for a specific group of people. She is undeniably the least punishing champ and therefore can be a good gateway champ for new players. The problem with champs like Yuumi is that her balance issue is not purely mathematic. Mathematical balance is something you can achieve much easier - but Yuumi's numbers aren't what make her so problematic. You simply can't put a number on being untargetable for the entire game.\n\nHer being so unpunishable also feels super toxic, especially considering that her enchanting power are on par with other enchanters - if not even better at times. Yuumi being somewhat terrible when undetached is supposed to be her weakspot to balance her out, which would hypothetically work, if she ever truly needed to detach. So, how can this be fixed? To me it was important to not take away her core mechanic of sitting on a champ. This is her thing and it's what makes her so great for so many players. \n\nI considered multiple fixes and thought a lot about their pros and cons. One fix would have been to have a set amount of time Yuumi can stay on an ally, before it goes on cooldown. This would make it easier for the enemy to play around and yuumi could decide when it's important to take a ride. However, this would require Yuumi to get a substanial buff for her entire kit + an extra buff for when she's detached, as she will be less gold efficient due to needing boots and also needing more solo power for when she's alone.\n\nOne of the other ideas was to introduce a new type of cc/keyword, that would pop detached champions off the target. Problem with this approach is mostly that adding more keywords/cc types to fix an issue is often bad practice as it makes the game harder to understand. It adds more clutter and words. Also, it would mean that yuumi is only counterable by designated champions, which all would need an update in their ability texts as well - just for one champion nerf.\n\n*I do not think that nerfing Yuumi's current kit just by values makes any sense, as this will probably just result in her being unplayable. Mathematical balance is unimportant if the gameplay feels unbalanced due to mechanical issues.*\n\n**My Solution:**\n\nSo the final solution I came up with is to let Yuumi generate new Stacks of 'discomfort' whenever her host is immobilized. At 3 stacks, Yuumi will detach herself and \"You and Me!\" goes on a cooldown. She loses one stack every \\~2-3 seconds (refreshes on immobilization on her host).\n\nIn the first iteration, I thought about having her detach on cc duration instead of a new stack mechanic, but this would bring lots of issues with it - most notably Cleanse and Mikael's Blessing becoming OP (as Yuumi would need a stat boost after the mechanical nerf). I specifically went with 3 stacks, because most supporters will not be able to proc the 3 stacks all by themselves - especially not without their ultimate. This is important, so that yuumi is not completely useless vs champs like Leona or Amumu. This also means, that the best way to kill yuumi early is to have a jungler that brings some cc too. Some picks would also be obvious counters now, like Vayne or Jhin, as they bring reliable cc to kick yuumi off of her host. Other champs that have single abilities that bring two instances of immobilization are great options for a team vs Yuumi too - like Poppy.\n\nOverall, this would allow teams to pick against yuumi, and for yuumi players to not be allowed to pick her vs literally any team anymore. If the enemy has a heavy cc comp, playing Yuumi would be a bad idea. And that's completely fine.\n\nOn the flipside, this would encourage Yuumi to be played alongside champs that evade cc, like Sivir, or could even motivate adcs buildings items like Edge of Night.\n\nIt is likely that Yuumi would even need a buff in her values after this.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that of course I did not put in the effort to create testing for this change myself. Testing stuff like this and iterating over it is one of the most important parts.",

Yuumi however, does not, that's the Problem. Apply Yuumi's Design to other Classes that need to be good at Positioning such as Marksmen and you will quickly understand that a Marksman that goes Untargetable for long Periods of Time is just as bad as an Enchanter.\n\nShe needs a third Rework that turns her into a real Enchanter. Make her IO from Dota or Taric 2.0, keep the Attach-Style Mechanic, but let her die if she's bad...",

They struggle enough with orientation. Yuumi gives those players a champ where they can just sit on someone, learn a lot from watching and start understanding how to use abilities, what items do and so on.\n\nOf course, Yuumi offers a little more than that, but overall not having to position yourself in any way takes away a huge part of the entry hurdle absolute newbies have to overcome.",

And while I do think that's partially just because it's not a great experience, it is also well known that most players simply don't want tutorials and will not play them, or pay attention in them while playing.\n\nAnd even if everyone had to go through the tutorials and fill out a mandatory test on them to see if they paid attention - this would still be mostly useless in a real game.\n\n&gt;And such things as cs, didge and positioning you VERY slowly learn on your own.\n\nI 100% agree. But it doesn't have to be learned from the beginning. Think of Yuumi like training wheels. She's there so players don't have to worry about cssing, dodging and positioning. New players have a hard time understanding what the champs around them even do. They often lose orientation and occasionally just path into the enemies without noticing. PC Games are hard, in League, out of the mainstream multiplayer games, may be one of the most difficult ones to get into. Many players simply need the training wheels to have fun. They'll get into learning all the other stuff soon enough.\n\nThe biggest problem she has right now is that those training wheels are there for everyone and make her a no-brainer choice into any scenario.\n\n&gt;Also why is yuumi 6300\n\nI don't know and I agree that it's stupid. It contradicts her design.",

    "postText": "I've thought about how to give the jungle less gold without creating a perma gank meta.  And I think I may have finally found a viable solution.  Anyone who has smite will pay the \"**Jungle Tax**\".\n\n**Jungle Tax** All items in the shop now cost 25% more for anyone who has the summoner smite.  Now jungle becomes a weaker role but perma ganking won't happen either.",

Lowering JG income is just creating a second Support and Eliminating Half the JG roster. Jg will always be OP because it has access to all lanes, controls objectives and can dictate the Map state at all times. \n\nLess Resource for the JG--&gt; Tank/Gank Meta\nMore Resource --&gt; Carry Jg Meta\nEven if you make it so that Jg can only gank at min. 14 Champs like Yi, Kindred, Trundle will be Meta.",

The only change is that the effective gold per kill/gank will go down but the effective gold per camp will also go down by an equal percentage.\n\nIt may not completely balance jungle and yes might push a more supportive/tank jungle meta.  Just like the role support is powerful yet has less gold.  But supports are not the actual carries themselves and junglers shouldn't be either\n\nUnder my system Yi and Kindred WON'T be meta think about it it will take them 25% longer to get their items whether they gank or power farm it will still take 25% longer.  Trundle it's harder to say he offers a ton of utility and may be good.",

Compare that to Radiant Virtue who will be 2875. You really think Carry JGers will be played if they need 4000 gold to get atleast 1 item. Gank JG work because they have utilities. They will be fine with 1 or 2 item. \n\nAnything that reduces the way jg can purchase items will result in a perma gank meta because carry jg will not be able to get their powerspikes on time. \n\nGotta be honest your idea is dumb and is worse than the class rework riot did a few years ago and the pre-season changes riot did reducing the gold camps give. \n\nGood think you're not in the balance or lol is probably gonna be dead.",

I've put a lot of effort into this and am very happy to hear what you think of it! Also I'm applying to the riot games internship with this, do I have a chance? ..\n\nBrenvar Concept: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/eaRn6P",

It brings unique aspects to the 'hook' game with being able to do like Orianna ball type tricks.\n\nWould absolutely love to have Brenvar in League!",

Shens sword will jump with his flash if he is already at max range, so I imagine this would follow suit. As far as the weapon following terrain, I'd think it would require an entire rework of the levels to implement. From what I've seen, there are no actors present on summoners rift that would indicate an edge of terrain. Also, breaking champion terrain would require a rework of not only each of those affected champions, but also the system and animations associated with the terrain. In all likelihood, the best case scenario for your champions ability would not be to break through the terrain, but to destroy it entirely; then nothing would need to be changed system wide, and you could simply end the ability (think second cast of Jarvans ult).  Overall I really like your design. I think you did very well on the design and background of the champ, but tried to implement skills that wouldn't particularly work in the game state and design as it stands. A rework of the champion to fit in with current code and coding limitations likely wouldn't change too much of your champion (like having the weapon mimic the champions pathing instead of dragging behind. It would keep the appearance, but would be much more like a shaco clone following your champion, that instead of you sending commands to, you interacted with).",

Each link of the chain is coded as a minion with no collision with champions,monsters, or minions, but still collides with terrain. The links are 100 units across, they are assigned a movement priority with the link closest to Bravar being highest priority and links further away being lower. When Bravar moves, the link closest to him will move with him. Once the distance between this link (designated A) and the next link (designated B) grows too great than link B will also begin to move towards link A. This process will continue until it reaches the ice block",

The Ekko ult passive was more of a \"this follows the player and is player owned\", which Brenvar's ice being dragged would be similar.\n\n&gt; Brenvar chain would not be able to pass through terrain \n\nThis makes me ponder. Would it not? When thrown it breaks player-created terrain. However, map terrain would not be broken for sure. Maybe that's a downside of this champ, it can't flash over walls? How would one handle that?",

Overall, I think his bases and/or scalings would need to be low to make up for that. My only worry with that would be the possibility of relegating him to support, but due to your idea of adding synergies with aura items his higher econ and more top/dueler friendly build path would still lend itself to top, making him flexible in both lanes, which I think would be great as a support main ahaha. Just the fact that I have myself thinking off all the possibilities just shows how well thought out and designed this concept is, and I sincerely hope you get your internship! Amazing job on this!",

If it's fast, you can Q through someone, E for a root, and Q pull, keeping them continuously locked down for a while. But if the Q is hard to hit in the first place, suddenly you may need to position for a successful E(out) so you can even attempt to pull them. I love the depth though, because this same skill combo can instead start with E(in) for a stun, Q to cut off their escape, and pummel them with bare fists.",

Naught for example has his stun on passive, hook, slow, and then ult. That\u2019s 4 for a already CC heavy champ. Your guy currently has 7 different CC effects. Leona has 3, thresh 3. This seems way to much to make it into the game. Otherwise really incredible work.",

She also has a slow on her W and a knock up on her Q that is also a dash. Her ultimate is another stun that spawns a BF area that slows everyone down.\n\nI think Brenvar could be implemented without many changes to his CCs, considering that all of them are stationary and/or skillshots.\n\nIf you're lazy to check it back:\n\nQ: Knock up + grab. Not more disruptive than Blitzcrank or Nautilus hooks, way harder to land, considering that the first cast **pushes** enemies away, making them not grabbable.\n\nE: Either stun on the center of a circular skillshot (much like Aatrox' third Q) **or** root enemies that happen to be between the glacier and you (there is a visible chain in the floor, just avoid it)\n\nNotice the **or** there. It's not two CCs but one or the other depending on the situation.\n\nR: Just a slow.\n\nNot that bad in my opinion.",

Can be done with higher CDs and Spellcosts, ontop of the lack of extra AR/MR. (I know this is a balancing question and not a design question.)\n* Adding damage to the windup of Q would add a bit more waveclear. Which also acts as a \"defensive\" option to make it more dangerous for enemies to come close. (Balancing out the lack of AR/MR passive.)\n* Microstun on E instead of Root could be another option.\n* E smash leaving the boulder in place similar to Q. (So both Q and E leaves the boulder. Might be too much flexibility though.)\n\nThis is of course just some thoughts I had. Always love a good Champion design and can't help to add my own thoughts and ideas.\n\nHope you get your internship! It's brains like yours we need in Champ design.",

Tanks rely heavily on getting AR and MR to do their job.\n\nIf you go in the Support direction. While you have CC, you don't really have a lot to protect your Carry with, and the big AOE abilities would (potentially) mess a lot with your Carry Farming.\n\nYou also don't have any Mobility on the Champion. Which leaves Top and Jungle the better options for this type of Champ, usually.\n\nWhy I'm thinking towards DPS (Bruiser/Juggernaut) is that since you've effectively taken away additional AR/MR, Brenvar wouldn't have any real way to defend himself outside of being a threat with Damage and CC. And you made his W a good tool to do additional Auto Attack damage *(so current Titanic or BotRK would be a monster on him)* while also Protecting Brenvar.\n\nEffectively Brenvar can be a Health stacking monster with good CC that can put up a mean fight, but you'd be highly vulnerable towards Magic Damage or Health Damage. So it's alright for him to have extra damage as he already has clear drawbacks.\n\nThis is of course only my brain spitting bullocks. It also comes down to whether you see him as an AD or AP Champion as that can change the entire perspective. (Would still be Melee heavy though because of W.)\n\nJust tell me to stop if I'm rambling too much.",

Though I will need to go off reddit soon for today\n\nI thought of Brenvar as a a Supporter/Fighter that does not bring a lot of DPS but zoning control to the botlane/Jungle or maybe(?) toplane. Alone he would not have enough (fast) kill pressure (i guess which makes him less suitable for jungle) but he would still be very much in controll of the fight because of the amounts of CC and Health. He should propably be scaling with AP and HP, but not as much that a Deathcap would make sense. But of course some of the damage dealt would be still physical.\n\nBut I think I will need to think about what you said for a bit more",

Just so used to all Bruiser/Juggs defaulting to AD.\n\nBut remember that DPS Champs aren't just burst Champs. Lots of Bruisers/Juggernauts deal sustained Damage, but usually has a combo that can deal \"semi-bursty\" damage.\n\nWhich is where your E1 -&gt; E2 -&gt; Q2 or Q1-&gt; E2 -&gt; Q2 makes for great Combos. Or going for the Tactical Q1 and using E2 and Auto Attacks for harass, trades and safe-ish farming if Top lane.\n\nYou've made a Champ that is quite flexible.",

At the early stage of development I saw him on toplane, I was imagining he is controlling the whole side of a lane with the chain, but in the end I think he would be actually a much stronger supporter than solo laner :)\n\nQuestion 2: I think if Brenvars Q ist up, it is a zoning tool similar to blitzcrak hook - despite the channeling time to throw (spinning). Yes i think he should not bring as much DPS as for example Darius and I can imagine giving certain CC on him up. E2 (whip) could be changed into a ministun instead of root and the whole suppression on the Q2 is not essential either. In terms of giving up parts of the kit, do you mean whole spells? Or just parts of the spells?",

If Q lands, the rest is effectively unavoidable short of very high tenacity, spellshields, or Cleanse effects and -- unlike other similar characters like Nautilus or Leona -- entirely multi-target if you've struck multiple targets.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**General Thoughts**\n\nQ right now is definitely your \"do everything\" spell, with terrain breaking, slows (in the image), and knockups. I think you can take a bit of power out of this, perhaps by making the knock-up into a sweet spot (perhaps the first enemy hit only?) and making the pull just a pull (no suppress) that's a set distance.\n\nI'd then make sure you don't have the immediate Q+E+Q combo. E2 is really neat, but since Q already applies CC you're going to fire that combo nearly every time you throw a Q that hits, and if you hit Q it's going to be nearly impossible to miss E (or Q2 after E). It feels like these two abilities shouldn't be on the same kit since they both provide CC in the same area, and doubly so if E2 and E1 don't share a cooldown.\n\nIf you keep E2, I'd recommend more ways to position the boulder, since right now it's either behind you OR in place from Q1, and E2 is most interesting to me when you have more freedom to position your boulder in fights, which the strength of Q is currently limiting.\n\nIf you keep Q, I'd replace E2 or remove the root from it so it's not such a surefire combo. When designing kits it's helpful to ensure that your abilities have some reasons to use them in varying situations, and right now because E2 hits in the same area as Q1 and Q2 there's never a compelling reason to use anything but Q1 + E2 + Q2 unless an enemy is oblivious enough to path through your chain while you're dragging it.",

You clearly put a lot of work into this. \n\nMy biggest gripe would be that for all intents and purposes, Q2 and E2 (I know it\u2019s not a two part ability but let\u2019s just call it that) basically affect the same fixed area, and E2 all but confirms Q2 for free. If not a rework to E2, there needs to at least be a global cooldown between casts Q1 and Q2, as well as E2 and Q2. Because right now, Q2 is definitely too strong for how easy it looks to confirm, and even not taking that into account the suppress is definitely too strong in general. \n\nWhat I think might be cool is if barehand E was an AoE smash same as non barehand E, but minus the dash, and it can only target the side of him opposite the side the glacier is on (so he\u2019s between the glacier and the target area), and has increased range depending on how far away the glacier is from him, and it places the glacier at the target location. This adds a further dimension to his gameplay, as opposed to Q2 and E2 fulfilling the same role",

Good counter pick for planning team fights against Anivia, Taliyah, etc.  No other champ has that ability.  Sure, Bard can tunnel through and talon can vault over, but the rest of the team can't follow!  Really interesting mechanic.  Maybe hard to implement and balance... But we dealt with Zoe when she first came out and we all survived.",

He would have to do negative damage, or have scaling so bad he'd end up a ghetto support.\n\nThis guy is basically Nautilus on crack.  A+ for effort but this is a balance nightmare. Pairing this guy with any high damage jungler would be absolute cancel.\n\nI like the concept but you really need to make some cuts in that guys kit.  Root the rock in place so he can't drag it, or move outside it's range while it's out. Then change the root on E and change it to a slow. That would be a start.",

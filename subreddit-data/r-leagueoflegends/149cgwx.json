    "postText": " \n\nIn this post I will cover various League elements that affect player behaviour and ways that these systems can be modified to improve game quality. Sections of this post will include:\n\nSurrender \n\nRole Selection\n\nThe Chat Function\n\nHextech Chest Incentive (S Chests)\n\nHonor Rewards\n\n**Surrender**\n\nGiving up early is part of Riot\u2019s official in-game reporting system, but Riot has also made changes to make giving up early more accessible.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lwdeeunf06b1.png?width=541&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd04058d300a2b2863452fb8f213481048c97bb4\n\n[https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Report\\_Feature](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Report_Feature)\n\nThe 15 minutes surrender was implemented in May 2017 with no context given:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7l70jsxpf06b1.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=60013bb958f9e5673736ac944c6326b2df6b08ae\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20170518215234/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-710-notes](https://web.archive.org/web/20170518215234/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-710-notes)\n\nThe unanimous condition was removed earlier this year:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hp1juxarf06b1.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a4cbf880c18955f42a7013e8d123587ec9e77e15\n\n[https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/game-updates/patch-13-7-notes/](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/game-updates/patch-13-7-notes/)\n\nA Rioter gave some context on this change, basically summarizing that games that are FFed at 15 are hopeless anyway:\n\n*\u201cI can give a bit more insight on this data, since I pulled it (I also moonlight as a data analyst in addition to my day job :D)*\n\n* *3.3% is the correct number*\n\n***Of 4 vote failed early FF's, a significant number get dragged out:***\n\n* *However, if a game ends before 21 minutes, \\~90% are held hostage (45% get FF 20'd, 50% end naturally by 20 \\[open mid or just lose\\])*\n* *80% of the games resolve by 25 minutes*\n* *Games that make it to 30 minutes have a 10% winrate*\n* *Games that made it to 40 minutes had a 45% winrate (but the incidence was very low)\u201d*\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/12cmyue/a\\_failed\\_41\\_surrender\\_vote\\_in\\_ranked\\_has\\_a\\_97/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/12cmyue/a_failed_41_surrender_vote_in_ranked_has_a_97/)\n\n**But these data completely ignore the effect that the option to surrender has on every game. The option to surrender early becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Even non-stomps are having their game quality affected by the existence of the option to surrender early.** If a person goes 0-2 at 7 minutes, some players would rather int the game to try to force their teammates to FF15, rather than lose lane gracefully and try to win the game.\n\nRiot\u2019s own data shows that 4-1 FF15 votes resolve by 25 minutes anyway, so you are saving less than 10 minutes in these games, at the expense of making nearly every game worse quality. \n\nThis mentality is widely perceived among league players, we can see a pile of reddit threads discussing this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/roxuyr1tf06b1.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7eb7bddb08a9df2368cc00be978033d60f1bb5d8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3sjk7acvf06b1.png?width=625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=df4c0c33cc05b18c75cdc6f86994d7d88aebbd11\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=ff+15+lol+reddit&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF\\_enCA762CA762&amp;oq=ff+15+lol+reddit&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6136j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=ff+15+lol+reddit&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA762CA762&amp;oq=ff+15+lol+reddit&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6136j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)\n\nWe can see that the average game length is around 30 minutes, skewing longer in lower Elo. Players should expect that when they enter a game, that's about how long they are committing to a game, they should have no expectation that they are getting out in under 20 minutes. **FF should be a tool to avoid hostage taking by the winning enemy team that refuses to end, not a standard way to lose a game.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5zite9yf06b1.png?width=412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=614a6b48051f10a26145bf78af65379818314ab4\n\n[https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/stats/game-durations](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/stats/game-durations)\n\nI suggest throttling the FF timer by rank, higher Elo players are much more likely to take small early edges and snowball the game out of control. They are also more likely to know when a game is truly unrecoverable. \n\nLow Elo has so many mistakes there's always a chance of a comeback. Raising the FF time in low Elo would also force players to improve their mentality, since they will now have to expect the game to go 20+ minutes. Playing from behind is an important skill, every player will lose their lane 50% of the time when playing at their correct Elo.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uywtldozf06b1.png?width=131&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=46ee04b7f8a28c25b4665cda3eee8d870ce19fa5\n\n**Role Selection** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ib8n24q1g06b1.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c43fb939caf535a1d6ea21695f59e6e650b0c6fb\n\nGetting Autofilled has long been a point of contention for many players, but Riot has maintained that this is necessary to keep queue times in check. However, we never really know the cost to game quality. Even if a player is trying their best in an unfamiliar role, it is probable that they will underperform significantly. Making matters worse though is the resulting mindset to either outright troll/int, or after a bad start, give up to end the game ASAP. This is a natural response when a player has no expectation of fun and getting out of the current game is a chore. Here\u2019s Tyler1 expressing frustration on the matter: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/10e6zxl/tyler\\_1\\_based\\_take\\_on\\_current\\_matchmaking\\_problems/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/10e6zxl/tyler_1_based_take_on_current_matchmaking_problems/)\n\nPerhaps a better system would be to let players opt in to longer queue time to lock in the preferred roles. Each role could display the estimated wait time. Let players select as few or as many roles as they would be happy to accept. Maybe the least popular role is &lt;1 minute and the most popular is 20. Players can make the decision for themselves if they prefer a faster queue or certainty over their position.\n\n**The Chat Function**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8zetdke3g06b1.png?width=327&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=86f319154d563a47c5969c334504b27499d0f461\n\n[https://notagamer.net/league-of-legends-how-to-deal-with-troll-feeder-in-the-game/](https://notagamer.net/league-of-legends-how-to-deal-with-troll-feeder-in-the-game/)\n\nI know LoL is a team based game that requires coordination and strategy, but that\u2019s not what people use chat for. Typing in League is overwhelmingly trolling, that\u2019s why one of the top recommendations for climbing, repeated time and again, is to /muteall. Even as a user of this function, it is not enough, I can still see when my teammates have started to type at each other and games start to devolve. Players simply using their time to do this, even if no one is reading it, reduces game quality, but usually someone does and it spirals the game out of competition. If typing was not even an option, players would be forced to focus on themselves and there would be very little opportunity for escalating intra-team conflict. Chat is fine in for-fun game modes, normals, and ranked flex, but get it out of ranked solo queue.\n\n**Hextech Chest Incentive (S Chests)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycw56h95g06b1.png?width=173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=37892483d0fb2102d239362dfad5e640f48efe11\n\nOne other small change that could improve game quality is changing the criteria for receiving a Hextech Chest. Right now you have to get an S on a unique champion, this worsens the already prevalent problem of protagonist syndrome in League of Legends. Getting an S requires you to get as much farm as possible, even if you have to steal it from your teammates, and punishes you for dying, making it more likely you want to type \u201cGG, open\u201d if you go 0-2. Changing the requirement from getting an S, to winning the game on a unique champion, will encourage players to lose lane gracefully and have a more team oriented, game winning approach.\n\n**Honor Rewards**\n\nHonor tokens are virtually useless at the moment, which is weird because incentivizing good behavior and reducing toxicity should be one of Riot\u2019s primary paths to improving game quality and player retention. \n\nWe can see below they build into almost nothing: 2 skins and 6 chromas.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vz89a4k6g06b1.png?width=525&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4d6803df438959dcfe9c13392b322664ab3b211d\n\nLet\u2019s stick with the idea of honor tokens for chromas. Every two patches, like mythic content, unvault some classic event-restricted chromas such as: Night Blossom, Hunter PsyOps, Resolute Sentinel, Coronation Battle Queen etc:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1b249aq7g06b1.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d819947bcc3d31ab61bbb61516fcde6a3ed2d8fd\n\nIf Riot really wanted to encourage honorable play, they could even make Honor Orbs/Capsules give RP.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rb5f3la9g06b1.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=43a835d67252cb63caac5b2dde31500f9aa53a74\n\nWe can see these containers offer nothing of value:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mr3tidgag06b1.png?width=621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1e585a870ca0bc001f0df5d5db6cf8e86d8c7642\n\n[https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Honor](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Honor)\n\nHonor rewards are such a good concept, and it\u2019s strange to see that Riot has implemented the concept, but not actually attached anything of value to the incentive. Event Orbs, Grab Bags, Masterwork Chests, and even Hextech Chests are all far superior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.",

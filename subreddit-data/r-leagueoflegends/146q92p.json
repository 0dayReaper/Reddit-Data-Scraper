    "postText": "It's not because I think Zeri should be the best sheen user in game, it's because I don't think an ADC should ever be able to fully ignore thornmail. 13.12 will introduce the first physical carry threat that will be able to ignore Rammus in his entirety (ok Trundle does but he's not a carry) and that is not OK. Even champs like poke Varus and Ashe take a large chunk from Rammus taunt, but if you taunt Zeri she just zaps you and applies spell effects. \n\nEither her zaps should apply on hit effects with each auto since they're auto attacks, or her Q should retain her on-hit.\n\nBit of a tangent, but this champ is a mess. Riot need to stop coding exceptions into the game, Zeri Q is unaffected by Navori even though by all wording it should be.",

It's that plain and simple, if you right click on an enemy with a champion, the ensuing move you do should be your auto attack. Zeri zaps you if you right click, thus its her auto.\n\nTo put it simply her Q is a spell that triggers on hits and sheen while her zap is an auto attack that triggers spell effects.",

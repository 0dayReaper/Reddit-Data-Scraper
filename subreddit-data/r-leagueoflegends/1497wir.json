There is the \"priceless.com\" website but that appears to only be selling fan bundles that are over 400 dollars.\n\nIf someone can point me in the right direction, I would appreciate it. I want to make sure I am in the right place since tickets are apparently going on sale at 10am est today.",

The way Mastercard pre-sale worked last time is after confirming your Mastercard on Ticketmaster, it let you into an exclusive queue to purchase tickets. I am just not seeing any information or listing on Ticketmaster or any other website. I will keep my eyes peeled at 10am.",

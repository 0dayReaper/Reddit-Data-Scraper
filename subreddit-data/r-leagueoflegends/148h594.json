    "postText": "Curious about thoughts on this. I'm a bronze/silver player that mainly plays Syndra / Veigar / Viktor, though I'm proficient on Akali, Zed, Karthus (mid), Azir, Malzahar also.\n\nI think I generally do pretty well in lane, esp on Syndra and can snowball pretty well from there. Issue is...I just can't CS to save my life....I can't break the 6 cs/m most of the time (partly because my style involves a LOT of roaming).\n\nI know advice would be to go into practice tool, but I just don't have the time (I'm working adult).\n\nMy question is how high do you think I can climb without improving CS?\n\n[op.gg](https://op.gg) for reference: [https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/Dr%20Kee](https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/Dr%20Kee)\n\nEdit: To clarify, I don't have too many issues with CS in lane, nor do I roam that much during laning phase. My CS drops off significantly when I roam in mid-game because I prioritize joining teamfights over side laning since I'm immobile and feel I can impact the game more in teamfights (since I'm low elo where everyone is non-stop fighting). Would appreciate tips for low elo. Or any tricks in sidelane to get more value out of it I guess?",

Roaming is cool but you gotta time it so you don't loose CS, usually by slowpushing and crashing a big wave. Most likely it's decision making hurting your cs, not mechanics.\n\nI'd say try to only focus on csing when playing mages and see if you can get around 8cs/m. If you can't then try assassins (zed with hydra maybe ?)",

It's mostly in the mid-game where I prioritize teamfights that my CS starts to drop significantly. Copying a scenario from one of my other replies. Curious how you would approach this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Say I'm a fed Syndra with a bounty and tier 1 turrets are down. There's no objective coming up.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There's a fat wave coming into my bot tier 2, but as I walk towards it from base, I see my overextended ADC / Sup (who are both slightly behind enemy bot duo) about to be collapsed on by the fed enemy jungler and bot duo in mid lane.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For sake of argument, say I'm 6/0/1, my ADC is 2/4/2, my sup is 1/5/3. Enemy ADC is 3/1/2, Sup is 0/3/6, and Jungler is 5/2/1 (and both top laners are jerking off in top lane / my jungler is dead)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In this case, should I run mid to try and turn around the ensuing skirmish to get my bot duo back in the game, or just let them die and run bot for the large wave?",

Stay alive, gobble ressources and go for low risk high rewards plays. With that said...\n\nThe main variable in lategame is objectives. If you don't have tp and you're strong, you wanna play on the side of the objective. In that scenario if your team dying means the ennemies taking baron, you going bot is int if you don't know where the ennemies are. If there is no obj up in the next 1 min and your teamates get caught, it's not a big deal and you should just catch waves and protect towers if you can.\n\nIf you play towards an objective and you make a catch, spam ping the objective. In low elo, people are afraid of baron and let games run for way too long. If you can get your team to go for it when 4v5, or when you see the whole ennemy team chasing someone on the opposite side of the map, that's how you close games with your early game lead.\n\nIf you get 1-2 kills, there is no obj and you have waves, you can also spam ping a tower.\n\nTLDR : Play around objectives, push ahead of their spawn and group when they're spawning. When there are no obj, stay alive, get xp and don't get baited by int.\n\nBasically, try to be proactive instead of reactive.",

Having said that, if you're having trouble with getting high cs numbers, you should break down where you're losing cs exactly. Each game take a look at your cs numbers at 10, 20, and 30 min. If you notice you're doing well in lane, like 70+ cs at 10 min, but falling off the longer the games go on, like 150 cs at 30 min, then your problem is probably not catching enough side lanes. In mid game, your game plan should to, when you base, look at all 3 wave states and think to yourself, \"which ones are pushing, which ones are open for me to go, which ones can I push before the next objective comes up?\". You can also do a little mini game where you challenge yourself to have 200+ cs at 30 min.",

When I say I roam a lot, it's in mid-game that I roam, not during laning phase. \n\nI definitely miss the bulk of my CS during mid-to-late game. That's because I'm constantly joining teamfights, which I've found a lot of success in during my climb so far this season. \n\nI know the advice is to try and catch side lanes, but two issues with this: (1) in my elo, people CONSTANTLY fight, and since I'm often the one ahead, I feel pressured to join these fights since I have the resources and can carry. (2) as an immobile mage, I find sidelanes to be super dangerous, and I don't want to waste too much money on buying wards to ward the jungle. \n\nWould love any thoughts here.",

                            "comment": "I agree 100%, with how much people are fighting in lower elo, unless you're a hard 1v5 carry champ, it's likely better to have lower cs numbers vs in higher elos, which have more structure. Of course this doesn't mean having something like 5cs/m is okay, you should try to aim for roughly 7cs/m. Another thing is knowing which fights to take and which not to take. Ideally you only want to be fighting at drake, baron, or if they're pushing your base. I'm not saying don't join every fight, but if you don't see a point to it, it might be better to just leave it alone. \n\n\nLet's say you see a 2v2 skirmish popping up in mid, but there's a wave pushing your bot tier 2 and drake is up in a minute. In most cases, that 2v2 is not gonna end in much if you just leave it alone, even if someone dies they'll be back up before drake spawns, while that wave would end up as a bunch of wasted xp and gold, not to mention you should have the lane pushed for drake control. Side laning also doesn't have to be just sitting in lane and mindlessly pushing, especially if you don't have vision. If you anticipate a fight coming up, you can always just clear a wave, go to where you think the fight will happen, then rotate back if nothing occurs. \n\n\nAs for lack of vision, i agree that buying control wards constantly is a waste of gold, but buying them once in a while is good, especially when sidelaning. You can think of it as an investment into you not dying, preventing the enemy team from killing you while sidelaning and denying them gold. If you really have no vision, then all you can do is just push the wave past the middle of the lane, then go do something else until it's pushing back to you. \n\n\nTLDR, you can think of midgame as a cycle between catch side wave, go see what's going on elsewhere, go back to sidewave, with recalls interspersed. Joining a pointless fight is generally not a good idea, and your teammates might actually play more safely if they see you're not there to back them up. Look at the minimap to see where enemies are before pushing a side lane all the way up, and get some vision down to keep you safer. If you have no idea where the enemy is, just clear the lane to the halfway point and leave.\n\n\nLet me know if anything seems unclear!",

Didn't really consider that teammates would play safer without me there, but that makes sense. \n\nIf you don't mind, two questions:\n\n1) If I'm losing lane and my opponent has shoved the wave into my tower and is beginning to roam bot. I ping, but my bot is about to secure a kill under enemy turret and doesn't listen, what should I do? This is assuming I'm not THAT far behind and know I can impact the fight if I follow and potentially get my bot fed, but I'll lose a bunch of CS for it. \n\n2) In the scenario you laid out, say there's no upcoming objective and the 2v2 skirmish is about to turn into 3v2 because my overextended bot duo is about to get ganked by the enemy jungler and is ignoring pings. Again, assuming I'm fed and in a position to impact the team fight (but also assuming there's a massive wave approaching my bot tier 2), should I try to save my duo or go for the bot wave?",

Every decision should be made around what brings you closer to winning the game. If you know there's like an 80% chance that if you get your bot fed you'll end up winning the game, then go for it. Same with the enemy roam, if you don't think it has a high percentage of working out, just ping best you can and let them take the coin flip on if it's a waste of time or not. Champs also play a large factor. Do you have lots of utility, to the point that even if you're behind your laner you can impact a fight? Then it might be worth it to go countergank as you wouldn't gain as much from the wave as your enemy laner would lose from a failed gank. Are you a hyperscaler, and can do massive damage in teamfights if you have enough items and levels? Then it might be worth it to take the xp and gold from the wave, and just ping aggressively and pray. A lissandra might go gank, because her cc is still valuable when behind, but a Viktor might stay behind and stack his passive to be relevant later on. \n\n\n\n2. Depends on who your botlane is. Ezreal for example can overextend because he has great escape with his e. This is where game knowledge comes in. Do you think your botlane can make it to safety with the adc alive? As long as your adc can survive, it's not too bad if your support dies. At the same time, how do you think that fight ends up? Will it be a clean 2 kills, or does your botlane manage to get one or two on the way out? A kill is worth roughly 15cs in gold, so if you leave that big bot wave will you manage to have more than a kill worth of impact in the skirmish? \n\n\nHopefully this answers your questions somewhat satisfyingly lol.",

Last hitting? Waveclear?\n\nIf you roam try to push the wave before, and remembers that roaming is always a risk, staying in lane getting the wave and plates is guranteed value, if a roam fails you can lose the game from that.",

I think part of the bias here is so far, I've gotten really lucky this season with easy enemy games, and I've been able to get very ahead early on, so when mid-game comes, I prioritize sticking close to my other carries to try to teamfight as much as possible.\n\nI could go to sidelanes more, but I feel like I would be putting myself at risk as an immobile mage, and in low elo, teamfights constantly happen, which is where I feel like I can add the most value. \n\nIn other words, going to a sidelane to catch 2-3 waves while risking being collapsed on feels like worse risk-reward than to join my constantly fighting team to secure picks and push for objectives after that. Is this wrong even considering the elo difference?",

Say I'm a fed Syndra with a bounty and tier 1 turrets are down. There's no objective coming up.\n\nThere's a fat wave coming into my bot tier 2, but as I walk towards it from base, I see my overextended ADC / Sup (who are both slightly behind enemy bot duo) about to be collapsed on by the fed enemy jungler and bot duo in mid lane.\n\nFor sake of argument, say I'm 6/0/1, my ADC is 2/4/2, my sup is 1/5/3. Enemy ADC is 3/1/2, Sup is 0/3/6, and Jungler is 5/2/1 (and both top laners are jerking off in top lane / my jungler is dead)\n\nIn this case, should I run mid to try and turn around the ensuing skirmish to get my bot duo back in the game, or just let them die and run bot for the large wave?",

Also you really don't want to roam too much on these champs compared to for example assassin mids. You should of course always look if your jungler needs help in river, but full on roams to another lane are often not that good with control mages since they normally have low mobility. Also before you go for a roam you pretty much always want to push your wave first so you have a small time window till the next wave hits, cause you want to loose as little cs as possible. You don't need 10cs per minute (in lower elos it's often pretty much impossible since there is so much more fighting etc.), but I would recommend trying to get at least 6,5 cs per minute for now and if you should get to gold then maybe try to improve it to 7.",

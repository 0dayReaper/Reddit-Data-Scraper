Today is day 2 of week 1 - unfortunately it still really hard to find VODS on **yt:** Search on **yt** for cblol english and the filter tool must be set to recent uploads.",

At some point the casters just started to call for fights and everytime the teams would instantly start beefing in the middle of the jg with no objectives up. That fluxo X loud game must have had more than 20 fights the whole match hahaha",

    "postText": "Edit: This is not about Crystal and Hextech looking similar, this is about Crystal and Hextech being both gimmickless, usual 1350RP quality skins, justifying their pricetag simply through artificial scarcity and not QUALITY.\n\nRiot promised us that the new Seasonal Mythic Skins will actually be worth buying.\n\nSo we got Ashen Knight, with an actual gimmick exclusive to them (and a sick thematic).\nEven tho [Pyke was peak Ashen Knight](https://youtu.be/4Q7cA00rHik?t=164) and the others got a somewhat watered down gimmick with the choir being integrated into their ultimates (still sick), they at least had something special compared to 1350 RP skins.\n\nNow we are at [Cristalis Motus Leona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOz-ibuLC8E) and that skin has literally nothing special, its just a plain (good looking) 1350 RP.\nThis is insulting, we were promised improvement compared to Hextech line and a more worth to purchase Mythic skin in general.\n\nME is expensive and selling you a 1350RP AGAIN for 100ME is just a plain insult.",

I don't think having all of the mythic skins be purple is a great idea; for Ashen Knights it worked and I was more lenient...but this new one really does just feel like hextech 2.0 which is upsetting because the concept arts for Taliyah and Varus etc all had them multicolored.\n\nJust make unique skinlines like any other skin, but exclusive to Mythic Essence I don't see how Riot struggles to grasp this",

And to add salt to the wound, the mythic chroma looks sooooo much better. That color palette is absolutely bonkers beautiful but locked behind a further cost of 40 ME. \n\nIMO they should swap the palettes of chroma and skin. Additionally the skin lines should not be white, grey and purple. But all the mythic chromas should be that palette.",

They aren't intended to be 'better' then 1350 skins (and if you look at them historically, aren't).\n\nLook at all the Prestige skins, which were a gold SFX changing chroma of the base 1350 skin up until a year or two ago (where they were a \"high society\" SFX changing chroma). Or look at every normal Mythic skins: the Lancer series were regular 1350 skins but only purchasable with Mythic essence, Dreadnova Darius or Soulstealer Vayne are literally 1350 skins from normal skinlines but only for Mythic Essence, the Ashen Knights series were regular 1350 skins but only for Mythic Essence.\n\nThe only reason to buy Mythic skins is if you are a champion main or want to own every skin. That's been the entire point of them since inception: an extra rare champion skin, not an extra good champion skin.",

Lots of mythic skins can have the same effort or aesthetic as 1350's.\n\nThe difference is the manufactured scarcity behind ME paywall which is why people complain every time a mythic is released despite claims of low effort, creativity, etc.\n\nIt will sell anyway because Leona is a popular champ, easy to use etc. They don't need to put that much effort in what they release if players will buy it anyway. Even if an epic skin with better vfx, sfx, etc. exists many people will still buy/use it due to scarcity.",

They didn't do anything to fix that (plus Pantheon literally looks like a purple Ruined Chroma)\n\nRiot then got a fantastic idea and just changed \"Knight Pantheon/Sylas\" into Conqueror &amp; Slayer respectively. They're not knights, so why would they need armor, hah.\n\nPyke, Morde &amp; Shen are pretty good, I agree.",

But then I asked a friend who plays at least 3-4x as much as me if he managed to get the last prestige skin cuz he liked the champion and he said he was only at like 700points. Like wth riot.",

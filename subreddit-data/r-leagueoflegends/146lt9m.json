    "postText": "I've been watching League Recap lately, he was my favorite YouTube when he was making the infamous League players series. Does anyone know where he is now? The only info I can find is his twitch says he manages RATIRLs channel, but I'm not sure that is up to date. \n\nAlso, is there any content creator that do anything similar or inspired by the infamous League players series?\n\nThanks",

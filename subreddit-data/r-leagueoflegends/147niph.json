    "postText": "Her Q has 750 range (there's the projectile speed thing, but often the projectile has a full 750 range if she's getting chased) and behaves like an AA that triggers on hit effects. On the PBE her passive and Q are getting swapped, her main form of damage will be her AAs which are 500 range.\n\nOther mobiles ADCs that deal damage with AAs with 500 and 550 range are Lucian, Kalista, Vayne and Sivir. And i personally think the Q-Passive swap is a step on the right direction.",

            "comment": "You don't know what you're talking about my man. Zeri's auto range not actually being 750 is because skillshots, like Zeri Q, are measured model center to model center, while AA range is measured model edge to model edge. You can test Zeri's range yourself, go into a custom game with another player, have them pick Caitlyn, and pick Zeri. Have Cait auto you from max range and try to Q back, you won't be in range.\n\nAlso, they're not swapping her passive and Q like you think they are. Her damage pattern isn't changing. They are removing her current passive (she steals shields and gains movement speed when she gets a shield) and moving all of the text for her right click to her passive. And they're making it so Sheen doesn't proc on Qs or uncharged right clicks at all.\n\nThe shield change is a nerf to how strong Zeri is with enchanters and against stuff like Nautilus/Taric that shield themselves a lot, and the passive change is to break the Triforce + Titanic builds. There are no damage changes at all.",

                    "comment": "Zeri's movement speed from ult isn't actually that much (10% base), and unless the enemy has a really bad comp or is just oblivious you can't really stack up movement speed since missing 2 autos causes all your stacks to decay. And even then if the enemy lets you hit 10 shots you only get 5% more movement speed.\n\nIn my opinion her main issue is that she is hard to catch and she builds a bit beefy. Being hard to catch wasn't really a problem originally since she would die pretty fast if you reached her and unlike other ADCs she doesn't have insane damage or good utility. The issue is her current bruiser build + any anti-burst enchanter makes it so you have to either all in with ALL of your teammates or catch her 2 or 3 times which is insane for an adc that is already hard to catch.",

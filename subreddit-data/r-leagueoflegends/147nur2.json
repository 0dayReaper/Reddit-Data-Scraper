    "postText": "TLDR: If you want you, can participate in my psychological survey on the addictiveness of League of Legends and the impact of LoL addiction on psychological well-being. (Link to [survey](https://forms.office.com/e/QikWyPUTDd))\n\nHi, I'm a German psychology student and for one of my courses this year I have to conduct a scientific study.\n\nI've been playing LoL on and off for 6 years now and ever since the first day I started playing, the memes have always been the same. Basically, one version or another of Tyler1's :\"... it sucks playing this shit! And I'm fucking addicted, so I can't quit!\". \n\nIt seems that most players talking about the game (on the internet) have a very negative view on it, and yet they still keep playing. I've been asking myself for quite a while now, how much of that is just memes and how much is true. That is what I'd like to find out with this study.\n\nThe survey contains two types of questions. The first type will be used as indicators as to wether a person might be addicted to LoL or not. The second part is composed of questions concerning the feelings of the person before, while and after playing the game. \n\nIf you're interested in participating, click on the link: [survey](https://forms.office.com/e/QikWyPUTDd)\n\nThe survey will be open for 2 weeks starting today (12.06.23 - 26.06.23)\n\nEdit: I just realized that the free version of forms only allows 200 responses. I will try to fix it as soon as possible. Thank you for understanding. \nFor now there should be space for 200 more responses. \n\n2. Edit: There should now be no more restriction on how many responses can be submitted. Sorry again to the people who took the time to answer just to see that it was for nothing. \n\nThanks for reading and thanks in advance for participating.",

It's so frustrating because the game is not meant to be played 4v5 and while winning a 4v5 can feel rewarding it's toxic to force someone to do that for 35 to 40 minutes. That's roughly an hour worth of your time, queue time and champ select included, to have an extremely unfun experience.",

Average League player mentality I guess. My point is,  there should be many things in the game that make you \"have fun\". Try to focus on the ones you can do in 4v5, not on the ones you can't. Lastly , there are also some 5v5 games where you Yi jungle will play extremely bad all the game, but steal you 2 or 3 kills accidentally and refuse to ff. It feels worst than 4v5 but you won't come here to complain\u2026",

It's rather simple really. But anything you say is just 'trust me bro' mentality.\n\nImagine we were talking about a different game, hell, lets take basketball, but one team has less players, this results in everyone being covered while the bigger team having more freedom of movement/passing. Aka, one team can't really play the game, while the other can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow putting it back to league; while you saying there are many things that makes league a fun game isn't wrong by itself, implying you can enjoy league where every base is covered and you're always fighting uphill is copium at best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn your example of a teammate inting, thats part of the game, whilst they might be bad, they have influence in the game one way or another that you can work with. If a person is afk, they leave a hole in said game, which gets filled up by the other team taking advantage of that.\n\nso thats why i dont complain about things that are part of the game, and complain about things that we shouldn't deal with in normal games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut you clearly only care about what you have to say, so i'll leave it at this, cuz you'll either understand or huff more copium",

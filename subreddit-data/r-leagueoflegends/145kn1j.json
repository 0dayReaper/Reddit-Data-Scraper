NACL doesn't get a ton of community content like this so I thought it would be worth promoting to bring people up to speed for the upcoming season!",

Dude actually does the grind and keeps up with all of the games not just from every major region but also the NACL including doing his homework on the background of some players. And he readily interacts with comments, as I know from experience between our little back and forths on EMENES and his accomplishments/level pre-debut in NACL and the Prince vs the field MVP debate.\n\nThe preview episodes for each region are pretty nice too, not just giving an arbitrary/vague ranking for each team as teams based on his opinion but actively scoring/ranking every player relative to each other, going over each of them individually, and then putting that into context of the team overall. For a league like NACL (especially in spring with the much larger pool of both Challengers and amateur teams all competing), it's very welcome and informative especially for a one-man team putting these together.",

Maybe someone has better information about the requirements for penta?\n\nEdit2: incredible how many people comment after obviously not reading the comment let alone watch the video. You're making fucking jokes out of yourselves guys.",

Its been a long time since I've played SR, and even longer since I've been in a penta situation, but I feel like I've seen a handful of *should-be* pentas but too much time had elapsed from 4th to 5th (was never familiar with getting rid of hexakill on first champion respawn, but that could have been what stopped it too, idk)",

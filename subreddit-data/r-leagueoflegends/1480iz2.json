Did he suck in the lcs? Yes, but I think it\u2019s because of his environment not his actual skill as a player. All last split and even when he was grinding champs queue during worlds he showed that he can perform. People forget that C9 was looking to pick up fakegod in 2021 for their academy team after promoting fudge and have him as a developmental talent. Like the guy is talented and has shown it. He just needs to right team and environment to succeed.",

There was obviously a huge deal of this made in le Reddit threads and all over Twitter about what a crime it is to shut the scene down. DisguisedToast swoops in, pays 5 low level players a 6figure salary, looks like a \u201cgood guy\u201d. \n\n\nMy point: he basically used this as a marketing exercise and will come to find that all those comments with 3k updoots don\u2019t *actually* represent what the community believes.

It's Sivir/Karma with less steps and less balance.\n\nAlso terrain a dash which has terraint scaling. Why does a champion with so much movespeed have a dash that is better than almost every other in the game?",

Besides when she was intentionally Olaf'd before this rework. She's a very well-liked champion with a high pickrate and a ton of mains, but her performance in solo queue isn't anywhere near nerf status. On top of that, she has a playstyle that is completely unique to just her, so her mains can't play something else that plays similarly. The closest is Ezreal, but he's still extremely different.\n\nA champion like Zeri, who is entirely reliant on skillshots to do any damage at all, needs to do more damage than a traditional ADC when she's hitting all of her Qs, for solo queue. Because most of the playerbase (gold and lower) are probably hitting 50-70% of their Qs, if that.  If she's balanced for pros kiting perfectly, at max range, hitting every shot, she's literally unpickable in solo queue.\n\nShe's another balance nightmare, for sure. But she might have the biggest pro skew of any champion yet.",

She's a balanced champion across all ranks of solo queue.\n\nThere was a time when ryze had a 44% win rate in diamond+ but was nearly 100% p/b with over a 60% win rate in pro.\n\nHis ultimate was simply unmatched for pro play. He'd warp minions under your tower for a hyper-fast push, he'd warp the whole team into baron or dragon pit, he'd warp the team out of bad positions to avoid teamfights, he'd warp just his tank into the enemy backline for an instant flank, the possibilities were nearly endless for a coordinated team. In solo queue it was very nearly useless.\n\nZeri is strongest in pro play, but until she's reduced to a troll pick in solo queue and still dominating pro play she's nowhere near that level.",

The way he exaggerates things and acting like the game is over just because T1 won one little skirmish is so mind boggling although GENG beat them over and over again. The bias is insane.",

    "postText": "So im looking for some opinions on how yall use your first 2 smites, for context I will smite the first buff at 600 hp while kiting it to my next camp since in general I think that buff hit harder than other camps therefore saving health and time. My second smite gets saved to contest scuttle, or worst case to finish a camp for level 4 and running into lane to counter gank or save my team. I also generally full clear the first time as who i play can usually get to scuttle right as or right after it spawns. for example Poppy has good early clear and i take a 2nd point in my Q at level 3 to clear faster waiting for the level 4 to take W as the armor isnt needed early and doesnt damage camps and I can get to scuttle a second or two after it spawns sometimes before if my kiting and cooldowns work out right. Even more I feel like having a stack of 2 smites for any more than a few moments is a serious loss of DPS on your clear.\n\nWhen do you smite first, whats your opinion on smiting buffs or saving your first smite for later.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/147866t)",

            "comment": "I do it depending on the champ I play. Champs that rely mostly on autoattacks and single target damage I smite krugs/wolf depending on which buff I start. On champs that have good area damage I smite first buff.\nThe idea is that area damage doesn\u2019t clear single mob camps faster but it speeds up clear on multiple add camps so it\u2019s best to utilise that and use smite on single camps to be more efficient. For champs without area damage it doesn\u2019t really matter for speed so I use it on camps with multiple adds to have a more healthy clear.",

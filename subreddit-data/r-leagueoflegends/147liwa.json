    "postText": "So I was comparing the present to the future ranked system. I was curious how the elos would shift and calculated every 4th Division of the different ranks compared to the rank right now. Therefore I took % of Playerbase as reference. So Master 0 LP is about 0,68% in EUW. Dia 4 0LP would be 3,68% (3% of the League Players are in the Diamond rank +Masters and above) \n\nI took these sites for my calculations:\n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/rankings/rank-distribution\n\nLOL graph of Player distribution by rank:\nhttps://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt731acb42bb3d1659/blt2a8d492cdc35e583/647e7feeeb65a1ce636e1098/Live_end_of_Season_CHART_03.jpg\n\nSo if you play at Gold 2 Elo (60 LP) you might end up in Emerald (0LP)\n\nYou would be Platin 4 (0LP) if you play at Silver 1 (60LP)\n\nGold 4 (0LP)  - Silver 4 (50LP)\n\nSilver 4 (0LP) - Bronze 2 (0LP)\n\nBronze 4 (0LP) - Iron 1 (20LP)\n\nThese might not be 100% Accurate since we don't know if they actually manage to split the Playerbase as they desire.

The players that are gold now would have been plat in previous seasons. \n\nYes people should be low elo, and they still will be, but its helpful to no one if there is a large skill disparity within the low ranks.",

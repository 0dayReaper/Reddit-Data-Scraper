    "postText": "I was not expecting today to be any different in terms of big life changes, it's really just a Thursday, pandemic seems to be easing up a little... But this morning, as I was playing draft pick, I understood something very painful: It was the last time I would play League of Legends.\n\nI have been experiencing a very sudden process of sight loss due to untreated glaucoma since April 2020 that culminated in me hitting the threshold for legal blindness last December. All throughout the process, I kept playing League, as it was legitimately my favorite game and I had so much fun playing, but the past three months or so have been incredibly taxing, emotionally. I was playing more sporadically because even 15 minutes of straining my eyes leaves me with a migraine, but the more time that went between matches, the more noticeable my sight loss became whenever I logged in and sat for 30 minutes watching my gameplay worsen, the information slowly becoming something I could not parse. It was obviously not just the migraines, but the solidification of the fact that, well, fuck, I am going blind.\n\nI know the community has a reputation for being jaded and toxic, and to an extent, I did get splashes of that experience, but honestly? My experience as a player was overwhelmingly positive. League was something for me to bond over with my real life friends, and a gateway to kind communities where I got to know online friends that would come to matter more to me than words could express. It was rewarding, I could see myself improve with practice, even if I never aimed for a high rank, and sitting down every night to play a few hours was the only thing that kept me going in what have been, quite frankly, a shit couple of years. When I think of League it's never the bad matches that stick with me, it's the neat outplays, the honest conversations about life in voice chat, the delight that came with messing around with builds and meeting people that I had this in common with. \n\nToday was the day the loss finally hit. I was playing a Lux match, and understanding that even with my main, even with the more contrasting skin I could find, and all the color settings adjusted, and a giant monitor with a magnifier could not do anything about the fact that I just could not play because I could not see anything relevant. No abilities, no health bars, no indicators... My lack of peripheral vision also meant that all my attempts at hitting anything were mostly guesswork. Hell, the only reason I knew who I even was playing was the color of the blurry HP bar that took up a quarter of my monitor. \n\nI don't think I can kid myself anymore into thinking that things will remain the same even as this huge part of my life changes into something unknown and terrifying. I hate that League of all things was what made me understand how real and irreversible the sight loss is, but it is what it is. So today, I have decided that I have played my last game of League. I did not savor it. I did not prep a goodbye party, and if this is a goodbye speech then it's kind of shitty.\n\nI would still like to make use of this cheesy word vomit to thank League players and the team behind the game. You've brought many things to my life that I hope will remain now that League is no longer in it, and I am grateful. Regardless of what comes next, I will remember these times in my life fondly, and that's pretty much invaluable.\n\nThank you, it's been great. See you on the flip side.",

Lux is a character with an iconic ability of a giant light laser that can go a decently far distance. To \"blind steal\" one of those monsters implies using your light laser without knowledge of that monster's current health and getting the last hit, effectively \"sniping\" the monster and taking the benefits for your team. Most of the time, when a team is not the one attacking these monsters but has a Lux, she will fire off her ability for at least a small chance of stealing it away. My sentiment is that when a steal occurs, OP will be our eyes in the blind part of the map.",

A trained doctor can give you a better idea of your actual risks, and tell you if less frequent exams are good enough for your individual case.

Even though it sucks to have dilated eyes, it allows the doctor to have a better view into the eye. Even on a routine exam, they will typically check pressure and take a good look at and evaluate the inside and outside of the eye.",

Unless it is a very specific type like congenital glaucoma (which means you're born with it and they notice it when you're a newborn) there is no such things as \"pulsating eyes\" or a \"mild headache\" that give any clue for the patient. Ask your ophtalmologist to dilate your pupils if they don't proactively do so and check your fundoscopy. If needed, they may need some complementary tests, like an OCT or Visual Field.\n\nEDIT: be in mind that you don't need to be hyperchondriac: glaucoma is very rare in people aged under 50 (assuming you're a typical LoL player)",

With glaucoma, you definitely don't want to magnify images because you'd end up magnifying the image into your blurry peripheral field from the glaucoma damage. With a reverse telescope, you *minify* everything so it will fit into your remaining central vision. Without knowing how much usable visual field you have remaining, it's tough to guess prognosis, but it's worth a shot. While this route is not easy to fix, nor easy to adapt to, it's definitely worth considering in your situation\n\nEDIT: It got me thinking, you could try to lower your screen resolution to shrink the size down to your usable visual field. It'll be really tough, because words will shrink and it'll be difficult to aim skillshots with because every mouse swipe you were used to will now carry you further in game, but with practice you can adapt. Glaucoma sucks, I've had to take people's driver's licenses because of it and they never even realized it was happening. Keep your head up and keep on trying!",

I was not expecting a response at all, much less such a positive one. I've had a rough few months and getting through my inbox is bringing so much of the happiness I'd been missing back... Thank you. I really am reading all of you.\n\nI'd also like to take this attention I've been given and redirect it to the needs of the blind and VI (visually impaired) community: I want to organize an AMA/Q&amp;A thing for people to get more informed about blindness and visual impairment. I can talk about my experience as someone losing their sight, which I would love to, but I am not a medical professional. If there are any ophtalmologists or optics technicians in the room, feel free to DM me so we can set something up so and we can answer medical questions as well.\n\nSomeone from this comments section made a Discord server, which is where I'd like to host the event, since it's less overwhelming for me. I'd love to see some of you around! https://discord.gg/MJf6csBkZf\n\nAnd for those of you in the comments that are also struggling with sight loss, low vision and blindness, regardless of whether you play League or not, here's another Discord server, from blind people for blind people: https://discord.gg/Mn8zzXYsT5 I hope connecting with the community helps as much as it's helping me.",

It sucks that you couldn't treat it in time to prevent this, and I'm sorry it happened to you. I hope you can still enjoy League in some way though, maybe watching the pro scene. And with all the negativity surrounding the game, it's nice to hear about someone who's had a positive experience with it.",

He fell into deep depression and ended up overdosing in his room I\u2019ll never forget his mother screaming for me to come up stairs but one thing I want to instill in you is please never lose hope, technology is coming along fast another one of my friends just had a corona implant so I know how hard this must be for you but there is hope and what I would give just to have another day with my best friend, I\u2019m sure you have family and friends that regardless of your sight love who you are and trust me life has many things to offer besides a visual experience and who knows maybe the tech will bring all that back, all I\u2019m saying is I feel for you and your story hits close to home I just hope you know to keep your head up",

I went to the eye doctor and they found that I have glaucoma while being very young (19 at the time).   **Latanoprost Ophthalmic Solution** was one of my drops that I have used in the past. It worked but my problem was that I can't remind myself to take it 3 times a day. Thou, this may be too late since any vision loss with glaucoma can never be regained. I wish you the best of luck and I have pray that my measures will be good enough to stop the gradual loss of vision. Plus the migraines hurt so much and they suck out the day.",

So many people have issues that they know are major problems but they just don't do a damn thing about it because it's too expensive to see a doctor and they just spin out of control into life changing tragedies. It's happening to numerous people in my family right now, including myself, and it's just so frustrating to recognize while knowing that medical bills are just too much right now so there's really nothing to do about it.\n\nI'm really sorry that this happened to you and hope you find suitable replacements for how to enjoy your free time.\n\nPS: Binge watch porn while you can, you'll want that stuff committed to memory for fap material down the road.",

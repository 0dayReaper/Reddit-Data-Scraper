            "comment": "\\- Mana and cooldown management were actual things that existed in the game;\n\n\\- Itemization allowed for more exploration and, consequently, fun (the final nail in the itemization coffin was that update that separated stuff into legendaries and mythics or whatever nonsense they did);\n\n\\- More active items meant some items required fingers and not everything was a stat stick;\n\n\\- The game was balanced enough and actually well made to the point you could viably play a Lux vs Zed matchup and potentially win if you had the hands and kept track of cooldowns. This was back in the day were mages with low mobility were allowed in the mid lane.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty sure it started going to shit with the coming of Yasuo. Not that he was THE problem all by himself but it was a sign of the design philosophy at the time that just became worse as time went by. A lot of people complain about toxicity, and rightfully so, but it wasn't as bad back in the day IMO and I'm sure it had something to do with the game being overall more fair, with more thought behind the player experience.",

    "postText": "Hello.\n\nI am reptile. Botlaner for FNC Academy.\n\nOne question people always ask me is \"What do I pick when my adc is \\[insert an adc name\\]?\"\n\nSo I made this botlane combo to help people choose.\n\nThe Blind is good blind with that adc, even when not seeing the opponent's picks.\n\nCounter is it is working well with that adc, but as a counter pick to the opponent's picks, not as a blind pick.\n\nHope you guys enjoy.\n\nFeedback is appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwitter link for you to bookmark:\n\n[https://twitter.com/Reptile9LoL/status/1667552070256193537](https://twitter.com/Reptile9LoL/status/1667552070256193537)\n\nFacebook:\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=100093127584917&amp;set=a.120717464375839](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=100093127584917&amp;set=a.120717464375839)\n\nIf you don't use those then we also have Imgur:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ylVukca](https://imgur.com/a/ylVukca)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Nilah Taric is also incredible.\n\nI see other people talking about Rell. Generally pro players do not have enough time to investigate every possible champion. I think they could probably do better but it's hard to figure out every possibility.\n\nHere's a random one: AP Varus Top just 10x'd its pick rate in Korea last week (It's in like 5% of all games last I checked) and it's starting to spill over into other servers now. His build didn't change. It's all the same items (Nashor's Riftmaker Zhonya's/Banshee's) but just out of nowhere it's a thing now. We may even see it in pro. But it's just been there waiting for a year+",

Just lightly studying stats sites over the course of a few patches you can see most outliers (Nilah, for example) and just by looking at ability numbers you can see others (AP Varus). Been talking about AP Varus for idek how long, including to pros, and its just shrugged off.\n\nAlso, I am very glad that you are on the team now, after seeing your insights into the game such as this. Gold standard for game devs when it comes to transparency.",

Her shield is finicky and weak compared to the other enchanters, she has no healing or actual sustain, her q and e are slow skillshots, she has no wave control, and W is useless when you're just trading poke. If Rell/Nautilus/Leona were the main supports being played, you'd see her all the time, but when other teams are picking Lulu Milio Nami you just sit there and get your ass beat for 10 minutes. Her teamfight cc is strong but it's also not that much stronger than a regular enchanter's.",

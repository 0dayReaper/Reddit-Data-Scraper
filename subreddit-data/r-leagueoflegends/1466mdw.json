    "postText": "so I was 1-1 on my diamond promos and on my last game I have a neeko cleanse ghost adc, the guy saying nothing in chat (they didn t had hard cc eitheir to justify a cleanse) and well basically I dodged last second considering that this game would not be winnable without an adc (especially considering how strong they are in the meta atm), just thinking that I will Q up again to do my last game of promos. But I forgot that dodging resulted in ending your series, so I was basically faced to not win my promos thx to a random guy and I just find it stupid. I also reported the pick but I doubt it will do anything to this sort of behavior.",

I\u2019ve dodged plenty of promos and games where winning was a very low chance.  MMR is way more important, and I\u2019ll quickly make up the lost LP.",

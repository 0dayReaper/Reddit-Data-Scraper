Riot agrees to do this effective immediately.\n\nAll but 3 teams pulled out causing a lot of young people to have no job and potentially a lot of issues that wouldn't be quickly solved like leases and visas. \n\nLCSPA was upset since riot told them it wouldn't happen this year in their talks with riot. They plan a walk out for first week of LCS.\n\nRiot tryed to force teams to field any roster they couldn't get players since most free agents were the players who just got kicked from their NACL teams.\n\nRiot decides to postpone LCS 2 weeks until an agreement is made with the LCSPA. If there's no agreement riot would cancel split.\n\nSome Doublelift stuff happens.\n\nRiot and LCSPA come to a good enough agreement last week now LCS is on for this week moving to 3 days a week to make up for time lost.\n\nPeople talk about NACL to generate the hype since its main reason for people not wanting to be in that it's basically generates a lot of negative money. Views add revenue that is now being shared with all NACL teams for this split\n\nEdit: correct from no to now.",

Orgs are looking to cut as many expenses as fast as possible. North American esports likely has the highest operating expenses, but no LCS orgs are publicly traded, so we have no 100% reputable information.",

Coaching, support staff, further player salary slashes, it's all coming.",

If 2/10 teams of the league are profitable, that's probably above the odds for Venture Capital projects, especially since the teams lack broadcasting rights, or revenue sharing like NFL teams.\n\nInterestingly, Astralis is publically traded, and you can see their financials if you want at least a peak at Esports financials past orgs exaggerating their costs to justify cutting salaries, or upselling their growth potential to investors.\n\n(They're negative, but year-over-year they've gradually cut costs, and increased revenue, but there's no indication if they'll ever be positive)",

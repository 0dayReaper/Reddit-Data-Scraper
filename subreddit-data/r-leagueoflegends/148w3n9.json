    "postText": "So I just want to say, as a Zeri main she has been the most broken adc for the last 2 patches and the easiest to carry on, perhaps apart from Duskblade Samira. She needed to be nerfed, and hard, but I think people are underestimating how hard the nerfs truly are.\n\n(For people who haven't seen), here are the nerfs:\n\nP - steals 45% of the shields she damages and gains 10% movement speed for 2 seconds whenever she receives a shield - **Removed** (Passive fully removed)\n\nQ - Burst Fire no longer activates Sheen \n\nBuffs:\n\n\\+5 MS\n\nE - +20% crit scaling (65% -&gt; 85%)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe main nerf is the Q change. It was a massive reason why Trinity was good on her and bruiser existed. For people who don't know; 200% **base** AD **bonus** physical damage on-hit, 1.5 second CD. Trinity also gives 20% base ad after AAing 5 times. This meant that with Runaan's, every 1.5 seconds Zeri would apply 140 - 200 damage on hit, to 3 enemies. I think you can see why this is broken.\n\nAdd on to that the passive changes, and Zeri basically cannot go bruiser anymore. Which I think is good. \n\nBut however, in the current state, Zeri has no other build.\n\nPre 13.10, she relied on Shieldbow heavily for survivability (which she has none), and phantom dancer to giver her a good 2 item powerspike. She has neither now. \n\nYou need a mythic in your first 2 items to be relevant, but no mythic is good with her. IE PD is a good 2 item powerspike, but you can't go either first, because you become useless for 15-20 minutes. \n\nAll good 1 item powerspikes have no 2 items powerspike for her either. Either you have no movespeed, no attackspeed, or no damage. The best I found on her (before bruiser was re-found) was Shiv into IE into PD. And even then I felt useless for 25 minutes just for a mediocre at best powerspike.\n\nThis is known by all Zeri mains, and to the point where we are considering stridebreaker as an option to continue building bruiser, since crit is just so bad for us.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAll in all, I am not saying Zeri shouldn't be nerfed, or some of the nerfs are need, or that even these nerfs aren't deserved, as damaging as they are. It is just I see so many people say that we need to reduce Zeri to a sub 50% winrate champion, or that the changes will reduce her power but not completely. And as I have shown, this won't be the case.\n\nTL/DR Zeri nerfs will destroy her as her Bruiser build is her only good build at the moment, not just push her under 50% winrate.",

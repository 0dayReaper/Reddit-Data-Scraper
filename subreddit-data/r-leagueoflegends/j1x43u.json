In some other games there are runs like this done showing you how to play at a given rank and maybe this was done in LoL at some point but I'm not aware of it.  In Starcraft 2 there is an ex-pro named Vibe who purposefully plays slower and shows you exactly how you can play to get out of every rank from Bronze through Grand Master.  His \"Bronze to GM\" run is frequently cited as one of the best resources for a brand new player to get into that game.\n\nAt some point though, at least in LoL, most of these runs just became about flexing and for whatever reason some people enjoy watching someone stomp on new players.",

Vibe also *plays* at the level he's teaching and doesn't deviate from a plan. If he sees the opponent is doing x,y,z strat and can be easily countered, his gameplay doesn't change. \"Oh, looks like I'm being rushed. That's ok, we're gonna keep doing what we're doing, probably lose these overlords\" etc.\n\nThe league equivalent is something like not watching enemy jg pathing at iron, purposefully never using wards, or ignoring matchup interactions. Personally in all the lol guides I've watched, nobody has gone as far as Vibe, but maybe it's out there.",

It comes even worse for those who feel unhappy from that experience, then trolling or becoming toxic in their future games.\n\nI think people forget how easy negative behaviour ruins the game, especially in high elo where there are less player.\n\nSmall actions to one person can go a very long way, same with positive behaviour, making someone's day doesn't only affect how you and the other feel, but those the other communicates thought the day (10's to 1000's). LoL games stems the same way,  Flaming one person in game or inting doesn't only affect them or you, but their moods and actions with future games or in real life. \n\nWhen someone does something negative and gets away with it, it only makes the community worse as others will do it or use it as an excuse that others do it. Hence why punishment systems are so important which LoL lacks to look after or keep a firm line with, epically with content creators. Actions like this aren't okay, and it's unfortunate a punishment is a mere at most a \"consideration\".",

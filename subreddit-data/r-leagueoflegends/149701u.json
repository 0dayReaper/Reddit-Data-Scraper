    "postText": "To start this off, we both met each other in year 7, first year of highschool and we both were considered the nerdy kids. We both liked to play games like WoW, Runescape and all that stuff, just fun, casual games until we for some reason stopped talking for about 2 years. During this time I began to get into league and at the time it was insanely popular, I was a bit late to the party but regardless I played whenever I could for as long as i could, always asking my mom 1 more game or 20 more minutes. I wouldn't consider myself the most unhealthy kid back then but my mum was worried I would become too skinny while my friend on the other hand was always running around at school, top of the class in sports like soccer, basketball, just any sport requiring great cardiovascular endurance, anyway, term 2 of year 9 comes and I recognise my friend while walking through the hallway, at first I was hesitant to talk to him becuase he looked pretty different since we last met. His nice, neat brown hear was all messy and scruffy, from having a healthy posture turned to a slouch, a bit of facial hair has grown, especially around his neck and he has gotten noticably chubbier. We say high and catch up on what we have done over the years not talking to each other, while we are walking I get to my class and we say our goodbye's. Once I sit down in class i couldn't stop think on how much he has changed, I talk to my classmates on how he has changed, at first they didn't know who I was talking about but once they realised they were shocked. Days go by of us talking about random stuff I asked why I didn't see him for ages, he then brings up how he's been playing this gam called League of Legends, at first i was estatic that I had another friend to play league with but then I realised he was explaining why he wasnt at school, I remember being excited about playing with my friend but didnt understand this had a relation to his absence. He then explains when he got home one night he was watching youtube late at night until he got an advertisement about League of Legends and thought it looked like a cool game, he said he downloaded it the same night and began playing the next morning, as soon as he got on he claimed that it was just such an addicting game, he then convinced his mother that school wasn't that important and he should take a days off, then days turned to weeks, then weeks turned to months, and then months turned into more than a year worth of playing league of legends. I secretly felt disgusted at this but i decided to hide my true feelings about what happened but I feel like I should confront him about his habits, we still play but over the years he has gotten more and more aggresive and just negative vibes. I feel like I can't keep playing with my friend and I feel like his behaviour is affecting me aswell, I've noticed my behaviour from a few months ago has just been more lazy and reluctant to do things. Can anyone give any advice about my friend or mabye should I stop playing league",

But at the end of the day a person can do whatever he wants in life. So long as it is legal of course. \n\nYou could try to invite to other activities you do but if he doesn\u2019t want to then that\u2019s that.",

Do what little you can to nudge him in the direction *you* *think* is correct, but ultimately you have to realize that it's out of your hands. Don't get *too* hung up on it even if you do care. Based on the post there's way more to his situation than just league of legends, he might be severely depressed or something similar. \n\nIf you really do feel the need to do something about it, simply confronting him in whatever way you feel best might be your best option, but don't go into it thinking you'll get results.",

Wanting to control them is a red flag. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just because you care, and you worded it weirdly.\n\nYou also are blaming League, but perhaps you don\u2019t have all of the facts. Maybe your friend\u2019s home life suck ass\u2014going through a rough patch, depression, maybe his parents aren\u2019t treating him as well as you think\u2014hard to say.\n\nSo he uses League to escape.\n\nAgain, impossible to say, but based on your friend\u2019s entire behavior changing and his hygiene dropping off\u2014I highly doubt League did that. Assuming he played games before League, this isn\u2019t new. \n\nSomething else could very well be going on in his life, and you might never learn about it. I had some of my own very close friends who had pretty messed up childhoods, and despite hanging out nearly daily, I didn\u2019t learn about the abuse until I was in college.\n\nAll you can do is be there for your friend. Maybe if you feel strongly you could reach out to a guidance counselor or something, and they can raise the issue anonymously on your behalf. They could also drop your name though\u2014not sure how it works\u2014so just be prepared that your friend might find out you asked the guidance counselor to check on him.\n\nIt also seems like you are projecting a bit\u2014perhaps you feel bad about how much time you are spending on LoL? Your last line \u201cor maybe I should stop playing\u201d implies you don\u2019t like your own behavior, so maybe you are judging your friend harder because you want to make the change yourself, but can\u2019t.\n\nAlso perhaps learn to use the enter key/space your paragraphs out\u2014Jesus Christ it\u2019s basic online courtesy lol.",

            "comment": "My first thought is, how is your friend's life at home? I know why you want to try and help him, I really do. As long as he has other things going on in his life, like still doing sports at school, video games are really no problem. But the second, anyone neglects everything due solely from playing video games is a sign of unhealthy coping. Like I said, his situation at home must be complicated, maybe his parents split, a family member died, parents are very busy people, either way he is not being treated well and might have depression. The thing you need to understand is it's not a 'problem' to be 'fixed', it's an experience that needs to be understood. Listen to your friend if he tells you something. Remember this, listen to him.\n\nInvite him in sports he likes. If he genuinely enjoys League, invite him to play. He plans to drop high school don't worry, It's not big of a deal unless you're a person applying to Ivies. He can drop school, get a GED, and still go to college to pursue anything once he's sorted out. He can still play video games in his adult years, if that's what he genuinely enjoys. It really doesn't matter, life is full of experiences and it's up to anyone to make meaning of it.\n\nI suggest invite him to play sports with other friends too, do you want to confront him? If so do it. You will learn more from doing things by yourself than if you let other people decide for you. Let this be a good lesson you will remember  my young friend. Sending best wishes to you and him!",

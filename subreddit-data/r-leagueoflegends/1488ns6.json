    "postText": "As the title states; I just lost LP for a game that the system allowed us to 'forfeit' 45 seconds after the 3-minute remake option was unavailable\n\nFor reference, the person AFK'd (was disconnected)  at 1:45\n\nGenuinely - what is the point of the remake system if this is even possible? In less time than it took to queue for the game - and less than the champ select took - I lost 14lp (with 11 mitigated)",

            "comment": "While I agree with the sentiment, if they mess with the remake window; it will become a foggy line between becoming an *abusable* feature vs. something that potentially increases QoL of regular players.\n\nRealistically, how many times have you lost a game because of this? \n\nPersonally, it\u2019s significantly less than 1% of my games. At that, I\u2019ve also won a few games because of this as well, so it\u2019s roughly even. Your 1 loss and 14 LP isn\u2019t going to drastically impact your rank outside of where you would end up anyways. I think the system works well as it is - when the remake system is actually functioning properly at least. \n\nFudging the remake window means boosters or duo abusers can just force a level 1 risky play and afk if it doesn\u2019t go well. This could become an issue that not only screws with the system but again, impacts the QoL of regular players negatively when they have to deal with this sort of strategy.\n\nThis is just one simple idea, and I\u2019m certain the clever duo boosters would find even more creative ways to take advantage of a larger remake window to prevent losses on a specific account/guarantee wins. Cheese build/champs with first wave all ins and afk if it goes poorly, the list goes on. It just wouldn\u2019t end well.",

Takes time, feels unfair. Not a good experience.",

Sadly, they\u2019ll never be able to prevent people from leaving the game at any point. They can only change how they deal with it.\n\nI just think there\u2019s a fine line that can\u2019t be crossed, and they\u2019ve mostly settled on that being the start of the game (esp with implementing rapid punishments for being late to the game). Personally, I agree that this is where the line needs to be drawn and extending past that will probably cause more problems than it solves.\n\nNo way to know for certain, but it\u2019s just my opinion.",

    "postText": "Hey guys so I had a question and was wondering do you guys think this will be a better change for ranked. ok my question is since your mmr depends on your winrate, what if instead of winrate it was on performance on the specific game? for example, I played a game a few hours ago where I got a S+, the most damage with like 3 KDA but because I got an inting nocturne we lost the game and because my mmr is bad, I lost 27 lp while gaining 22 if I win, so I thought what if instead of the winrate it was performance and since I performed that game great I should lose less lp if its a loss and vice versa for win except you get more lp? wouldn't that be a better change in general for ranked? Would love to see what you guys think about this.",

You try to fight and lose several teamfights after the other, while 1 or 2 teammates just don't approach those fights and just CS more, to get a better score. In the end you go out like 6/4/1 and get a lower score and lose more lp and the other people who didn't fight will lose less LP if you lose. If you manage to win those fights and carry, yes you maybe get a better score or your score is fucked up because those fights and those who didn't and just played safe will also win the game and get even more lp. That would also be unfair. As I said, in the end it's probably a preference, since both would be kinda valid",

I ended up getting a flank and that helped ace the enemy team for us to get baron and snowball it into a win. 8k down at 18 minutes, not a single ff vote the whole time. \n\nI ended the game 2/11/3. Two teammates up voted me for \"monk mental\". With your idea, performance based lp gains, why would I even try once I got so far behind?",

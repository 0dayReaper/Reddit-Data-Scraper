    "postText": "Since it's the end of the split, smurfing is becoming a serious problem. Lately it feels that I have no impact on my games anymore and the team that's ultimately going to win is the one with the smurf.\n\nFirst of all, let me define what I call a smurf, so it doesn't feel like I'm complaining about genuinely better players in the same elo.\n\nI'll occasionally (about 10% of my games?) see a level 30 account that botted their way to 30 then jumped straight to SoloQ, with a winrate close to 100% and a 20/5 average KDA or something. There's no way in heck a new player is stomping Platinum lobbies that hard.\n\nNow, for me. I seldom \"lose lane\" versus smurfs If I'm the one against them, so at least I'm not actively feeding them win-vitamins. In most of those games, I'm actually doing pretty good and so are some of my teammates, but we ultimately lose the game because our macro decisions simply can't compare to theirs.\n\nI'm at a point where I'm more afraid of a 5/4 Sion smurf than a 30/3 Platinum enemy Katarina, because low elo players make readable mistakes, but I'm not on a level to identify and capitalize on the (few, if any) mistakes made my boosters with high elo macro.",

Make sure lanes are pushed, priotize waveclear if you can (static shiv over rapid firecannon for adc for example) and \"turtle\" (bunkering around your base and maybe your jungle and playing defensive, trying to catch up with enemy gold).",

Her entire team was grossly underleveled compared to us but it didn't matter. At min 14 she started spawn-camping us and killing us before we could leave base, giving her 1/8 mid and top enough time to push and end.\n\nSince she was last pick, we didn't pick a ton of CC in our team. We only had a Nautilus but at that point it didn't matter anymore.",

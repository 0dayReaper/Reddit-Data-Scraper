            "comment": "Souce: lived in Japan for a year.\n\nIt is mostly like any other server in terms of skill, if you are playing somewhere between low-diamond and low-iron.\n\nThe queue times are absurd due to low player numbers, 5-6 minutes is normal and expected. \n\nThere are not as many Japanese players, especially when it comes to plat+ ranked, because the server is used by Chinese/Koreans/etc. to have a simpler time climbing.\n\nFlaming exists, but honestly, Japanese can't flame for shit. They usually stop at \u6b7b\u306d or something like this. Chinese are more creative in that aspect, though.\n\nEhh, that's everything, I guess? Japan had no serverwide unique events, I got 19ms in Osaka. Okay, now I am done.\n\nEDIT: Oh, about ranked. If I recall correctly, you can queue up anytime.",

                            "comment": "If you are D4, the main difficulty will come from having high queue times. I was D3 when I transferred to Japan, and was met with the infamous combo: my MMR may be the same, but my division was around P3-P4. Because of it, I had to climb all the way back with D+ queue times, and they are anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes. On average, you waste one game-length of a time for every 3 games you go into.\n\nIn terms of skill, no. I think that Japan is easier than, say, EUW at D1+ level, but until then it is just the same. If you are circling somewhere around D3-D4, you shouldn't notice anything too different. The only thing that comes to mind is occassional micro gods from China that fucked my shit up with Qiyana and the likes.\n\nEDIT: Oh, about accounts. It's a hard question. Transferring seems the best, because you can continue to improve your account (skins, masteries, challenges, if it's important to you). However, Riot regularly disables transfers for long periods of time, so you may end up with your account locked in Japan for quite some time. I returned from Japan in April and had to wait several weeks until Riot miraculously enabled transfers back. But I got really lucky, though.",

FLY/C9 are top tier. Every other team could be anywhere below that. I place GG third based on their success in spring, but could see their overall performance lower. Most of these teams just don\u2019t make any sense to me, and aren\u2019t really playoff contenders. Outside of IMT and FLY, the roster changes were questionable throughout the league. That said at least 2 of them will be moving on to face international competition.\n\nMark places TSM/IMT too low and EG at 5th is funny",

They don't have their starting mid for week 1 either, and with every week being 3 games the longer that goes on the more it hurts them.",

EG blowing up 4/5 spots on their roster is definitely going to make them a weaker team than they were last split. NRG is pure NA copium, CLG had a miracle run last split and I don't think they can do it again. No one on this NRG roster is top 3 in their position, and some of them aren't even top 5.",

CLG 2016 failed to make finals after winning spring. 100T looked worse after they won summer 2021, and never improved despite staying together for 3 splits.\n\nI'm sure there are a lot more examples of non-first place teams getting worse between splits as well, I'm just focusing on split winners since they're more memorable.",

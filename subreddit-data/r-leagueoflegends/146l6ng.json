Do you believe it had a positive or negative effect on the game? Or do you believe that it added zero impact to the state of the game?",

A lot of people will check the bushes to get a cheeky kill or just stop your back but very few people check the alcove. Plus they offer good outplay potential. Sometimes you're getting ganked and you can turn it 1v2 but you just need a few seconds for your CDs.  Though I play top idk how well they work for outplays bot.",

See, people don't think they do too much because they don't have any obvious negative implications at any phase of the game. They don't do \\*too much\\* positive either, in just about every situation their presence on the map is either neutral or slightly positive. I think that's the best possible state for any released change to have. It harms nothing, usually has no effect, but when it does, it's a positive one.

Its not a big negative, but overall still negative.\n\nThey change almost nothing outside of cases where a mobile champ can abuse the fact that they have mobility and someone else doesn't; it took a problem that already existed and amplified it.\n\nAside from that, they just extend some outcomes; not change them unless its one of the above mentioned cases.",

    "postText": "So, recently I've tried stuff like Bardo or Sion support with smite and Teemo/Pantheon support and camp top lvl 1 and I really enjoyed just being a nuisance in normals (lets just say I couldn't replicate the same cheese in ranked games)\n\nI don't think there's a crap ton of variety when it comes to cheesing your games other than harassing the jg or camping a brush, but who knows, maybe it just takes some creativity. As the title suggests, I wanna see all of the innovative and funny early game strats (a.k.a cheese) you can think of.",

It was very hard to pull off and I don't think it's possible anymore with the s13 jungle changes, before you could heal off of smite and a ton of potions, you'll probably get killed by their buff if you do this now lmao",

We both start with spellthief and no pots  go top level 1, and usually get flash/kill, then we go mid and finally go bot. We then proceed to lane until we get mobis and just perma roam after that. We don't do this in ranked, however we have a pretty good winrate on the strat i think.\n\nAlso we build mobis&gt;Everfrost&gt;Cosmic drive&gt;Deadmans/Force of nature for more movement speed",

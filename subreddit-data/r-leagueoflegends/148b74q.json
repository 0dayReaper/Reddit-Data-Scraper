    "postText": "Hello summoners! I have started playing league of legends in season 10 and I decided to share my experience on this \"experiment\". So, when I started, I was bad, as everyone which is not a problem, I kept going and training and I got better, eventually escaping bronze, i was pretty happy. \n\nSeason 11 starts. I immediately got gold IV from a few games, something like 20-25 games. I was hard stuck gold IV for a year with over 300 games, I gave up on this season, at least i reached gold. \n\nSeason 12 starts. Not, this was the first season I really spent time playing this game. I developed so many new skills and yet I was still not able to escape gold, but I always felt like every game is a coin flip. Every game I always had at least 1 person that died once and decided he will leave or either troll the rest of the game. Something happened one  day and the game let me out of gold after 850 games. Ridiculous amount of time spent on such a low rank.\n\nSeason 13 starts. I see myself as a great player. My mechanics and my game knowledge is actually really good now. Nothing crazy, just a diamond level i think. But my rank is still platinum IV. This season I have 900 games. CRAZY! But i kept going, I lost plat over 6 times due to trolls, but I always went back. My lp gains are terrible: +15-16 for a win and -29-30 for a lose. I don't know if is it me or the account or my luck. I can't just pull the plug on the account because I have spent so much time and money. There are no games where my kda or farm would worse than any of my teammates. I always win games where my team doesn't even win lane, they just stand under turret and dont feed. It's enough for me to 1v9. Im an adc main. So when Im lets say 9/0/2 in lane, and press tab my top is inting 0/8/0 my jg is perma typing doing nothing, we have bot prio but bo drake, I have to take it. My mid is not always terrible but usually never wins lane, but that's not even a big problem. Just don't go 0/10 and let me carry. \n\nAfter this many games, I still don't know if Im the problem here, or my luck, or my account. \nHelp\n\nThanks!",

In fact, if you're mentally stable, you have 5 potential inters in the other team versus 4 in your own team. If you're good, you win, if you win, you get higher lp. It's that simple.",

I don\u2019t even play on that account anymore except to Smurf. When I got a new account - 22 games. 22 games and I was higher lp on my new account than my 300+ game one. That account is now Diamond 2. It\u2019s INSANE how many games I would have to play on my main account to finally bring it up to my smurf.",

            "comment": "The experience will not get better until Riot starts punishing people who grief. And they will never do that. I don't know why. Maybe it's a logistics issue. But I can't imagine it's all that hard for an algorithm to detect blatant griefing.\n\nA support has 70 cs in 20 minutes without gold-sharing item, and ad has reported that person? Punish. \n\nJungler took no objectives despite the average lane position of all lanes being higher than the enemy (aka high prio) in the first 20 minutes, and two or more people reported him? Punish. \n\nSomeone died 30 times in 20 minutes? Punish. \n\nSomeone is taking no action and is reported by three people? Punish. \n\nThese are not hard things to implement. Have different categories for griefing, to make things easier. We already have leaverbuster, so no need for afk report. Make it clear that the afk report is for people who are intentionally not actively participating in the game.\n\nHave a report option for supports taking farm, or standing behind doing nothing.\n\nHave a report option for a player sabotaging teammates with abilities, like Trundle pillar, Anivia wall, or Blitzcrank hook.\n\nHave a report option for anyone following the jungler around trying to steal camps.\n\nThere are loads of things Riot can do, but will not do.",

                    "comment": "Bro no hate but i think your pretty far from the truth here.\nMeasuring Grief on an objective and automated level is pretty much impossible.\n1. Every Normal Player has a bad game where he just dies 6 times in lane with no bad intention\n(Not even considering Jgl camp etc.)\n2. To rightfully punish Griefers you always will be forced to draw a line somewhere. So tell me is 0/3 int? If not is 0/4? No is 0/5?... Anyway somebody is gonna get a Punishment bc he randomly died one more time than someone else?\n3. Punishing Supports for taking cs or jglers for not taking Objectives would be punishing based on Meta or Playstyle (Maybe the jgler has a Gameplan where his Farm is more valueable for hin than drakes or he doesnt want that elemental drake and waits for the enemy to take it).\n4. How would u even automaticaly distiguish things like griefing with anivia wall?\nAs a Main i have placed many many almost Perfect walls that turned out to be accidental Grief by a Pixel.\nCode cant tell if somebody tried to help and failed or griefed ( Maybe maybe u could consider canceled ally recalls but then maybe friends get each other banned by accident for having fun)\n\nBut the Biggest Problem is:\n5. Every System that implements big reactions to Reports can an absolutely 100% be abused by the same Griefers u meam to punish.\nPremades bombing one random the adc reporting for every cs taken.\nJg report for no objectives bc he died to your lane opponent or took a buff u wanted.\n\nIn conclusion, i think implementing effective automated anti Griefing systems is way harder than just giving the players a report option for everything and programming:\n/if grief\n  then punish\n\n(Just a policy for the future. If u have an idea to fix a long existing Problem fast and easily it probably isnt that easy to fix)",

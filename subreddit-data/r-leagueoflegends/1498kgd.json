No other adc would have had the balls to flash forward in a game 5 at worlds to win his team the game and there is a world where he messes up and loses his team the game.\n\nIts really not a bad habit, its just a result of his playstyle which isn't bad or anything, someone like ruler plays more consistent but the result of ruler's playstyle is that he can't carry as hard and plays passive.\n\nDifferent playstyles come with their own risks and rewards, its just that the risk in Jackeylove is much more visible than seeing Ruler playing too passive and losing his team a fight they could have won if he went in 100%. Its just much easier to tell when Jackeylove fucks up coz he just dies, much harder to tell when a player fucks up by being too passive.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am what you would class as a new player to League I have had my account since 2012/2013 but I never really played during that time. I would occasionally come on for the odd game but I had no idea on how to play the game or anything. Anyway, back in February I picked the game back up due to some friends really enjoying playing it and I am really loving it (I am basically addicted).\n\nThe reason for this post is because I really enjoy playing ranked, I am currently Iron 1 in both Flex and Solo/Duo but I was Bronze 2 last week and Bronze 4 before that for Solo/Duo (I had a very nasty fall :( ). I usually play Top Lane and I am really liking playing Ornn as I find the idea of being a tank that just get's in the way and knocks up enemies to win team fights really fun. However, I feel that the people I am getting matched with are just not really able to capitalise on my plays to make it worth it (It is here I should mention I am not bragging or saying I am the best Ornn player ever, I am just saying that I have games where I have the most kills and damage because my ADC or Mid is basically just a lane minion dressed as a Champ and I am sure we can all relate to that).\n\nOutside of Ornn, I can play Darius and Pantheon quite well and I have dabbled in Fiora, Camille and Cassiopeia. I find Darius is fun but I feel you start to fall off as the game goes long since in team fights you just get pounced on and Pantheon for me has a similar issue to Ornn as to me he feels he does better for team fights to play around his stuns. I can also play Mid to an okay degree and I have logged many hours playing Jungle.\n\nMy questions are the following:\n\n1. What role should I invest in learning if I want to climb out of Mid, Jungle and Top?\n2. Based off the role you recommend who is a solid champ to pick for low elo climbing who can do a lot on their own?\n3. Are there any resources or materials you would recommend to a newer player looking to learn the games mechanics better?\n4. Is it just me? I am fine with honesty and I understand I have a lot to learn and do as a player to grow, if I sound like a quitter or you think I am wrong please do tell me as I would like to know!\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this guys :) !\n\nHere is my [op.gg](https://op.gg): [**https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/GhostMasterGod**](https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/GhostMasterGod) \n\n(Please do not judge the name I made it when I was 13 and also ignore the ADC games, that was me just trying something new since my rank is already super tanked.)",

This game is, contrary to what people make it out to be, genuinely pretty well balanced. Buffs and nerfs and shifts usually only move a champion a few percentage points in either direction and anything that goes further than that is often reversed in the next patch, champions are rarely massacred into significantly handicapped territory and when that happens it's almost always because of pro play. That isn't to say there aren't stronger and weaker champions and the meta is completely irrelevant just that consistency as a player and being able to execute on a champion or few champions you're practiced on is usually much more valuable than a couple of percentage points fluctuation in winrate from patch to patch, especially in lower skill brackets where people aren't good enough to capitalize on the micro stat changes that came with a patch anyway. And it ensures more long term skill growth than just jumping from meta high win rate champ to the next each patch (also why I always tell new players not to look at tier lists, they're pretty worthless for anyone trying to learn, and very quickly obsolete in a patch cycle this quick). I'm not saying you have to keep playing Trundle jungle or anything but just in general if you like a champ and its playstyle and feel you do well, don't worry too much about the nerfs your comfort on the champ will very likely cancel them out.",

Specifically, you're looking for champs that are more meta agnostic; which means a champ that tends to at least usually be decent, if not good, and is a core part of the lane meta over many years.  \n\nLooking at mid currently, champs like Akali, Sylas, Viktor, Ahri, Zed, Akshan etc. are fairly meta agnostic as they tend to be around regardless of the specific quirks of the meta.  \n\nHowever, if you are to look at a mid tier list currently, you might see a lot of tanks and bruisers, stuff like Renekton, Nasus, Cho, Malph, even Ksante is showing up there.  These are the kinds of champs I would not recommend a beginner midlane player to focus on, because while they are currently strong in the meta at the moment, and while they are sometimes useful as a specific counterpick in mid historically, they are unlikely to remain in the mid meta for a long time, and Riot is not going to try to balance for them in mid, as they are not considered mid champs.  \n\nTo give you some examples of this in toplane, you've got the classic \"Four Horsewomen of Toplane,\" Irelia, Camille, Fiora, and Riven.  These are usually decent regardless of meta, especially for one tricks or experienced mains.  Darius is also an absolute staple of toplane soloqueue, and really the main difficulty you will face as a Darius player is he gets banned a lot.  On the tank side of things, Ornn, Sion, Cho are all toplane staples that you will see pretty much regardless of meta.  There's a lot more than these, but they're just the ones I know off the top of my head as a non-top player.",

Pick 2, max 3 champions that you like and stick with them. \n\nOrnn is very good, always useful even if you are behind. Watch some youtube vids for Ornn combos, he can burst people surprisingly well.\n\nDarius is fine, but he's banned and picked a lot, play if you like him but it may be hard to pick him.\n\nPantheon is a really specific champ, you need to know matchups to win early game, have good roam timers, and understand the map very well. I'd say drop him for now and maybe come back after you're more experienced (doesn't apply if Panth is your favorite champ, then just play him and learn)\n\nSuggestion - Mordekaiser. He plays very much like Darius, rather simple to pick up, and if your team needs AP damage you got them covered.\n\nIf you want some gameplay commentary: \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRYOKK6Dzlc&amp;t=8274s&amp;ab\\_channel=BrokenByConcept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRYOKK6Dzlc&amp;t=8274s&amp;ab_channel=BrokenByConcept)\n\nThey look at different toplane clips and discuss them. You will probably be overwhelmed, but you could listen to it just to see how a high elo toplaner thinks and maybe rewatch it after some time.",

That said, as a jungle main, I can say that until Plat, jungle is FREE to climb with if you know how to move your camera and clear camps at the same time. Ppl just overextend on vision and stay in lane with no HP giving you a lot of free kills.\n\n\n2. Just avoid playing early game champions that fall off a cliff because you and your teammates probably don't know how to snowball and end games early yet. Stuff like Nunu, RekSai, Elise, Lee Sin, I'd probably avoid.\n\n\n3. I just watch vods from a OTP or high elo player to learn how they use their skills. Stuff like how you clear jungle, how you gank, how you approach fights, etc. Videos about game basics in general can also help you a ton since you're new but I haven't watched them in some years so IDK what to recommend in that aspect\n\n\n4. There are always games that are unwinnable regardless of your performance if you aren't smurfing like 2 divisions below your main. So no need to be harsh on yourself, and if you keep winning your lane and outdoing your lane opponent in fights, you'll climb. You only need to 1v9 carry every game if you want to accelerate your climb",

Trundle is one I'd avoid only because you'd struggle versus good duos who can kite you well so you'd depend on your team and feel really helpless versus those scripters/smurfs. Some others who are really good, consistent, and versatile imo are Ekko, Kayn, Hecarim, Vi.\n\nPersonally am a Rengar main, currently Master, but wouldn't recommend him for ppl starting out, KhaZix is an easier alternative if you do enjoy it",

You can climb with anything though. \n\n3. Those skillcapped and proguides videos could maybe be helpful for newer players? I'm not sure, maybe other people can attest to those 2.

Since Yuumi is giving mana these days, can we reintroduce that to Soraka's kit again?",

Zephyr's an interesting item, it basically makes bruisers good vs tanks, but league's entire item philosophy has been bruisers are good vs tanks for so long that tanks now only have knock ups and displacements in their kit, so the tenacity is useless and that was always the hallmark of the item. Mana.... mana manipulator? Who runs out of mana these days?",

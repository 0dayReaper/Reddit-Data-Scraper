That shouldn\u2019t be a thing and is quite literally broken. \n\nThis is not a skill gap, it\u2019s just nonsense. Have they said anything about this? Because I hope they\u2019re patching it soon cuz wtf.",

I was able to spot the minion Neeko; realizing her exact location amongst the minions, so I shot my skill shot R at her and I thought to myself, does she really think I\u2019m that dumb? And my R proceeds to do nothing lol. I was flabbergasted. Oh well. Another rito moment ig. \n\nIn a way, she\u2019s rewarded for acting oblivious cuz now my R is on cooldown.",

She takes the negative traits from her transformations as well like things that deal increased minion damage, she can get Sion E'd etc. \n\nThat said it can feel very bad if you are Varus as you cant easily break her disguise as say Senna can with her CC.",

Can jinx R a minion? No so why hit something disguised as one. Same thing with Sion E. Sion E knocks back a minion, so he should knock back Minion Neeko.   \n\nThe only real inconsistency with the Ultimate negation is Caitlyn where if Neeko transforms as Cait R is flying in the air she will still get hit for full damage. Which funnily wasn't the case initially as Cait R deals 0 damage to minions hit, so this was added to Caitlyn as a countermeasure.  \n\nHeimer Turrets, Shaco Boxes (Both from R and W), and Maiden all use their basic attacks without their special cases such as Heimer Beams or Maiden applying %HP Damage. GP Barrels cannot be turned into.",

            "comment": "This is kinda hard to explain and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a better way but the best way I could think of atm is if you imagine your monitor as a big square, divide that up into 4 quadrants (4 smaller squares). I typically put my character in the middle of one of those 4 quadrants. Maybe not exactly but about that spot, and the specific spot or quadrant will change depending on where I am on the map.\n\n\nFor example blue side bot lane would be in the bottom left square, this gives me more view of lane and my enemies, the space behind me isn\u2019t as relevant, but still a little visible. Red side is worse for this because the HUD gets in the way more often.\n\n\nMy game is 99% unlocked screen (I only lock it to recenter when I\u2019m looking away then immediately unlock it), but some people hold spacebar or even play fully locked screen during laning phase. Unlocked is obviously better overall but locked at times is fine, do with this whatever is most comfortable for you.\n\n\n\nFor not seeing people until they\u2019re on your screen, you should be looking at your minimap much more often. Like basically every second or two you should glance. I don\u2019t think this is a camera positioning problem, it sounds like a wards + looking at minimal problem.",

            "comment": "Good camera positioning boils down to providing yourself as much relevant information from your FoV as possible.\n\nWhile laneing you generally want to have your character towards one corner of your screen and your opponent(s) towards the diagonally opposite corner, with some adjustment made so you have a reasonable view of jungle/river exits. This will vary based on the wave position and also which side of the map you are on of course. For example, you are the blue side top laner pushed up to the opponents tower: your ideal camera position would be to have your character in the top left quarter of your screen and your opponent (under their tower) in the top right quarter. This means their tri-bush jungle exit is in your bottom right and the river entrance is the bottom left. If we use the same scenario, but this time you are the red side top laner under your own tower, you want your opponent and the wave in the top left quarter and your character in the top right quarter but slightly more towards the centre of your screen than to the right. This is because you will want vision behind your tower in case of a dive from behind and the fact that a gank via the river entrance is an unlikely one so deeper vision of the lane isn't necessary (an exception here could be that you have a ward in the lane brushes and so may want to keep that in your FoV too, though it would be better to spot this from your minimap). \n\nA good exercise to help your understanding would be for you to figure out for yourself the following scenarios for bot lane as both blue and red side: pushed to enemy tower, 75% towards enemy tower, even wave state, 25% towards enemy tower, and under your own tower. If you do and want someone to look over your answers feel free to reply/PM me.\n\nWith that all said, while good camera positioning will help improve your gank survivability, by far the biggest factor is your ability to read the game and adjust accordingly. League is a game where you're almost always playing with incomplete information and have to balance risk and reward. For example, you are the top lane and enemy jungler started bot side camps and so most likely they will end up top side between 3-4 minutes. Let's say they decide to gank mid and get a kill but leave on low health: you didn't actually see them recall, but the most likely decision is for them to recall and spend their gold, at which time their bot side camps are coming up again. The most efficient decision is for them to go bot side for the camps, meaning you have at least 2 minutes to push/trade until they're likely top side again. There's always the possibility of course that after recalling they immediately run to top to gank you because you're pushed up, but this is where you have to learn to balance risk and reward not just for yourself, but also your teammates. Their jungler may come straight top, but in the process loses all his bot side camps to your jungler, who then also dives the enemies bot lane.\n\nThis got much longer than I originally planned, but hope it gives you/others something to think about!",

            "comment": "Your real problem with ganks is not the camera, it's watching the map. When you are getting ganked it's not really about being able to see them immediately on your screen, but rather having a ward bit further than the river bush and spotting them already when it's safe to retreat, or a logical thinking such as hey we spotted him going to his bot side jungle, I'm guessing he will likely try to gank me in about 30-50 seconds depending on the camps. \n\nWhen it comes to the camera itself play around with the camera sensitivity till you find one that feels right to you. What a lot of players do too is that they constant switch between locked and unlocked while playing, e.g. unlocked during farming and locked during fighting when they want to concentrate on movement rather than repositioning the camera none stop.",

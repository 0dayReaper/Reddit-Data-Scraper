    "postText": "I can partially understand why emerald might be the first choice to consider when naming the tier because it could be a reference to the Emerald City or because emeralds are quite expensive or valuable, but I think that naming it after something else would be better because unfortunately it is next to the Platinum Tier which already has a greenish/teal tint to it. It is possible that they will make the tier a shade that is not similar, but it will still most likely be too similar. Emeralds do not only come in a greenish color, but that is the color that is mostly associated with them so it would be a little strange for the tier to not be green but that might be an option to consider. I think that a better option might be to consider naming it after a different gem. The best option to me seems to be Onyx because it is a unique color and does not make people think of other gems like emeralds, rubies, or sapphires.",

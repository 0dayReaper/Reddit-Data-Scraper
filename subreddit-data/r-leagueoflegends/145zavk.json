The issue is that the adc role has become a position that players for the most part only ever want to be filled by marksmen, auto attack based ranged carries. Which then means they will forever be doomed to relying on their team mates to keep them alive and enable them to output the damage their character is capable of. You could \"fix\" it by making bot lane more than just marksmen, which it has been for a couple of years now, but then you're in a dilemma where marksmen are useless and you never pick them, or they're incredibly broken and the entire meta revolves around them. \n\nAdditionally, the people that like playing adc like it because they WANT to play marksmen. It's the only role where the players don't want more options, they like what they do and don't want to expand, it's a very specific gameplay deliverable. I'm not blaming the players, because I too love playing marksmen, but if bot lane and marksmen became as loosely related as mid lane and control mages/assassins has become, this issue of balance wouldn't exist. You'd just have another issue that adc mains hate the game (in general, many players do both)",

But if you want bot lane to no longer have the issues it currently has, it would need to get away from being a role occupied 99% of the time by marksmen. That wouldn't necessarily be an improvement though. While it might fix a lot of current issues, it would cause a lot of new issues, and people who play bot lane on the whole would hate it, which was the entire point I was making that you missed",

Good luck with him on tanks xD. Not that tanks are hard but players who specialize mainly in squishier carries have really INTeristing and weird gameplay when they are on tanks. They try to do too much instead of keeping it simple and often get bored. Bruiser-oriented players typically are much more stable on tanks but suck on carry toplaners. Also, Ale is as good on Camille, Fiora, Gnar and some other champs as Bin, he doesn't \"just play carries\", Bin is just a more adaptable and versatile player and nobody can really rival him except 369 with his masterclass team fighting on tanks or Shanji specifically on his Rumble so it's kinda unfair comparison for anyone, not just Ale.",

The man was looking like Faker outside of maybe facing Bin, Ale and Shanji who would take those mechanical skill checks on carries no problem (YSKM still looked decent enough) for some time until he got figured as an extremely one-dimensional player and super-specialist even compared to most carry type of toplaners like Ale himself. Now people just do a 369 cosplay even if it's without of any of his finess and a very scuffed one and usually it's still enough to completely stone wall YSKM making him extremely inefficient.",

And Leave, while hyped, was an unproven rookie. Just because a team makes top 3, doesn\u2019t make them a super team. It\u2019s not even like EDG were top 2 for most of Spring because of raw individual skill, it was their macro that set them apart similar to GenG.\n\n2. Ale has been really good this year. He was a top 2 top in regular season and the best carry top player until Bin had his playoffs run. He made 2nd team all pro in the league with the strongest toplaners. Also was the player that laned best vs. Bin in playoffs. A bad series or two from a carry toplaner is not unexpected for the role.",

I think it's less about prostitution being illegal (though also a problem) than about it being incredibly frowned upon. \n\nI think the biggest problem is not that it's illegal per se but that EDG is one of the biggest esports orgs in the LPL, maybe even THE biggest in terms of fans. Keeping Leave on the team would result not just in a team environment chaos but most likely also in a PR nightmare - and idk, but I'd guess that Suning back then, being a less popular team, didn't suffer nearly as much from the backlash as current EDG would.",

If 369 and Knight can peel Elk the same way they peel Ruler than they should be fine. It's also more about the jungle matchup against Kanavi",

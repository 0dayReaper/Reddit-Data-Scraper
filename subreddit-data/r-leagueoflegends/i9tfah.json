Like, I wouldn't advocate that he get another on target spell, but maybe a projectile speed increase on Q, or less of a delay on W would really do a lot to help him.\n\nLast time I played him, I would throw out well aimed spells for characters with even a single dash to just avoid the brunt of my damage. That's totally ignoring things like Yasuo who can repeatedly dash through creeps making it effectively impossible to land the Q or the W. He's definitely balanced numbers wise, and I really miss playing the champion, but damn if all the extra mobility didn't make him harder to play than he's really worth.",

Or not joining their \"engage\" despite you being low on mana, health and out of wards..\n\nOr the entire team that watches too much pro play and expects a low elo support to roam all across the map at level 4, magically providing more than 3+1 wards, make plays for every role and also protecting the overextending adc..\n\nYou cannot outdo this pain we chose, but you may be the person who makes us feel like the struggle is still worth it.

Zyra is more like a control mage, so protecting her wouldn't be really that important in most scenarios, but her plants are often overlooked in teamfights, and they do hurt with Liandry's/Sorc(/Oblivion)\n\nHealer, like /u/ahambagaplease mentioned, but also other enchanters like Lux (support), Karma, and Lulu (1st rule to win against Lulu is to kill Lulu) are worth peeling for, considering they can do it for you too, but have hard time doing it for themselves alone.",

He has not yet learned that you can't just run forward into enemy territory, or even your own territory late game if you're losing because you don't have the vision control or the map pressure to back it up.\n\nAll HE sees is that he's constantly being jumped on. The problem is that he is assigning the fault to the lack of team support instead of recognizing that the team support isn't there because his position is an unwarranted one. I see several clips where he's isolated in the middle of a lane where it's obvious from a minor glance to me that the team is on the back foot. This can happen occasionally even to good players, as they can expect backup in a situation where they'd win if they have it, but that clearly isn't the case here.\n\nHe's just far to aggressive and reckless with his positioning as well as some serious mechanical errors when it comes to his champion.\n\nI'd say he's in bronze or maybe low-middle silver (at best) - possibly even Iron if he's new, and most likely he is playing with a friend who is higher rated in a normals game. Otherwise if the account is high rated he clearly bought the account in the first place barring some critical physical injury to result in brain damage.",

Gold players would win lane 9/10 times vs a Bronze player, but Gold players will still make brain dead plays. Skill is relative to whatever rank you're at, for example...\n\nA Gold player climbs through Bronze relatively easily because they'll almost always have more gold due to better farming and mechanics, so when they make brain dead plays they will work more often because they have more items &amp; levels. \n\nWhen a Gold player is playing a Gold game, it's harder for them to get those advantages and so they will look much worse when these brain dead plays happen. They still deserve to be their rank most of the time, but these types of players won't climb because they don't understand more complex areas of the game like cooldowns, gold differentials, positioning etc.\n\n**RE: Toxicity**\n\nYou'll find this at EVERY level of the game. Not always, but probably 30-50% of games you'll play with somebody who has a bad attitude. You should learn when to mute people and always focus on yourself. Don't get drawn into it and just remove yourself from the chat the moment it starts (mute. mute. mute) you'll enjoy the game a lot more",

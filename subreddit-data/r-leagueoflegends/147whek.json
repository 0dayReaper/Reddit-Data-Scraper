    "postText": "I know I am not original with this, but I wanted to share this with you guys.   \n\n\nI started playing in 2011 and played ranked since. I was once dia 1 80-ish lp in season 5, but never that high until now. I've beenconstantly in a really bad mmr situation as so many of you nowdays, always the d4-5 with seemingly no hope. Until 2 months ago when I allowed my account to decay and then spent 1 week dodging (dodge nr 3 is 12 hours and I have work). After this my mmr did re-bounce and I started to climb. I got to D2 pretty fast and with like 1 short lose streak I went up to the promo which I just won.  \nI am really happy that even though I am over 30, I feel like I've never been even close to this good. Excercise, mental health and many other aspects did improve in my life and I am grateful for this journey that I've been chasing for over a decade. Getting master maybe is the easiest ever etc, but IRL circumstances surely did even out the competition.  \n\n\nI may have a terrible hairline, huge forehad and be (slightly) ugly, but FK yeah no1 will take this from me, I am really happy.  \nThank you!",

Everybody claims elo inflation when in reality players are just getting to the ranks they wouldve achieved if they put in 500 games. Players are still hardstuck all the same so good job buddy! Top 0.5% is a serious achievement, my buddy and I also just hit masters this season and we're over the moon.",

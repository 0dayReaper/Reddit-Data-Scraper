            "comment": "I think it's viable to an extent as long as you know how to Yasuo.\n\nBest supports are those that are aggressive with him and allow him to snowball early. Someone like Janna may seem interesting but it's not my preferred pick with that. My personal favourite is Pyke for him, actually. If he can snowball early and shut down enemy ADC he wins.\n\nI used to run Yasuo + Pyke bot a real (s9-s10) while ago and it's genuinely very fucking fun if you can play it, it's nasty. Certain displacing supports (I know for sure Pyke, but Naut also works. Idk about Thresh, probably not) actually count as a knockup, and you can use your ultimate with it if you need. Naut is probably best. (EDIT: Forgot Rell, might be best supp for him) \n\nYasuo is generally a massive fan of playing aggressive, it's his entire playstyle (there's a dose of reason behind his 0/10 meme). Yasuos just beat their head against the wall until their play works and they become good enough at the champ that it works most of the time.\n\nHowever, if you want to play him more like a scaling carry in some way, you can try playing more passive with, once again, someone like Janna or some enchanter I GUESS can work. I didn't try that.",

Karma-Yasuo helps you establish pressure, poke from range, shield Yasuo to farm, and the root can set up a guaranteed knockup. Couple the shield with windwall and you're actually pretty safe for a lane with a melee ADC.",

Very obvious how you play around them. They hook, and you attack targets in your face. Windfall behind them, and you force 2v1 fights that the 2nd enemy laner has to watch or walk into.\n\nDiving supports are a lot more hit or miss, but the idea is mostly the same... these are your rakan, Leona, Alistair, etc. \n\nEnchanters? Besides yuumi. You're gonna have to play really far back with them, and go for winning via attrition. Cause if you go in? Your support can't easily follow you. Yuumi? Makes you feel God mode once you get like level 6 and Zerker greaves.\n\nMages? Similar to enchanters you're gonna play back. But once they land something big? You follow them up... and not much can survive a mage+yasuo on them.",

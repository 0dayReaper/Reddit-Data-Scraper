    "postText": "I got this idea from Valorant about how they allow you to q with more than 1 friend but you all gain and lose less rr. I think it would be cool to be able to q with 2 friends instead of just 1  (in a ranked mode that was competitive) to be able to have more coms and more reliable teammates.  \n\n\n Why not just q flex as it is? well if you don't already know flex rank is completely ignored by 99% of the community so often times when you q flex with a few friends you will all be silver in flex,  gold in solo duo (the mode that people care about) and the enemy team will have people who are silver in flex DIAMOND in solo duo. This happens in a majority of flex games.   \n\n\nTo balance it out it would be the same as flex where you can't q 4 stacks only 1 2 3 or 5 stack q. Every 5 stack plays against another 5 and 1's 2's and 3's get into games together. Also as mentioned Valorant makes you gain less RR for queuing with more people and more if you're solo/duo. Also Diamond would only allow solo/duo and Master+ would still be solo only. \n\nThis change would allow for good players to climb much quicker and more efficiently because they can pick and choose reliable players to q with therefore making the game MORE competitive because, at the end of the day, LoL is all about its competition. \n\nThe change would also allow more semi-competitive for-fun players still play ranked against evenly matched players who are trying to win (less likely to run it down, ff, or first-time new champs)\n\nPersonally, I would be all for this change but, I think the BETTER alternative would be to REMOVE DUO Q and have only RANKED SOLO and FLEX q. \n\nThis change would have the people who prefer to solo q play with others who are solo players and everyone else (still only ques with 1's 2's 3's and 5's) can play a more team-based style of league where you can play with 2 friends if you want or even 5 stacks and come up with strategies and work together instead of flipping the dice on random teammates. And for this version of the RANKED Q's diamond and masters + can continue to play with 1's 2's 3's and 5's if they want \n\nIf you read this far let me know what your thoughts on this matter are. Would you prefer ranked as it is, no more solo duo and flex split just RANKED q, or SOLO ONLY and RANKED Q.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "They should've implemented VALORANT's rank system to League long ago. It's literally a superior system. \n\nYou could play with more friends (which is what most want), Flex Q is worthless anyway at this point. It's ranking system simply doesnt work, since soloq is a separate thing, also you can play non 5 stack vs a 5 stack which is terrible. I really don't undertand why everyone values solo/duo so much. We all know what experience that is, games are more like coinflips for griefers/egoistic assholes in your team that refuse to win.\n\nMy take on that is: remove solo/duo, implement VALORANT's system along with performence bonus system that is has. Since it's the only rank Q and everyone plays it, you can balance out 5 stack vs non 5 stack issue easily.\n\nFor anyone that says solo/duo takes individual skill into account and this would make it worse.  You are simply wrong. As long as Duo exists it's will never be indivitual skill especially since playing duo literally matches you with worse teammates. On the other hand making it solo only would kill it completely, even now Master+ players are complaining that they can't play duo and the game is boring. Imagine that for everybody.\n\nAt the end of the day most of the community are casual players. No game should be designed around top 3% of the playerbase, and current middle ground just doesn't work. Sweats want soloQ only, everyone else prefers to play premade.",

Some say it is a terrible idea because no one respects flex q which is why I think this is a good idea to begin with. Some think that Solo would have no chance against 3 stacks and 5  stacks (they wouldn't go against 5 stacks) and if the 3 stacks are good they will climb and face players at their level. If having coms as a 3-man was SOOOO broken people would drop the discord links in champ select WAYYYY in order to climb faster. League HEAVILY focused on the teamplay and not the individual skill so being able to play with a good group that can coordinate better is how it already should be.  FLEX is a JOKE as of now but if they removed the seperation completely or made is SOLO or Ranked q most of the playerbase would switch to caring about Ranked q not SOLO.",

Riot imo has failed with flex queue and I think Im in the majority of wanting to scrap it and return ranked 5's instead.

This would remove Duos from solo (less matchmaking problems for the \"serious\" ranked mode) and fix some issues of flex (namely population size and Qtimes)\n\nPersonally, I see it unlikely to implement because it's a risk because of how many people may consider stopping playing Ranked altogether if Duo is removed (because Flex may still be seen as a joke), not to mention that it may not necesarily fix Flex's population problem. It can help with 3s + 2s, but if you have too many 2s and too few 3s, that still leaves very little solos for the last spot of the team.\n\nAt the end of the day, league is a game, games are meant to be fun and league is usually more fun with a friend. FlexQ is seen as kind of a joke and if you remove ranked duoQ and tell them to play Flex it doesn't necesarily means they will actually go there, as the \"rank that matters\" in the eye of the community is solo/duo, just like no one actually cares if you were dia+ in TT, because \"lmao 3v3\" and no one but high elo ARAM players actually care about high elo ARAM or even know it's a thing.\n\nSome will say \"b-but my ranked integrity\" but realistically you are playing a 5v5 co-op teamwork game as a solo player, integrity is kinda relative here and Riot's matchmaking tries to compensate.\n\nSome will say \"well, if you want to play 4fun then go to normals\", which is *exactly* why you are not in charge of big decisions that could alienate your playerbase away from your company's product.",

                            "comment": "As someone who plays a bunch of midlane mages - mana costs are absolutely still real, I constantly run out of mana early game and still occasionally run out late game, even with building a lot of mana giving items and often running manaflow band, and sometimes even biscuits. Lately I've been playing Ziggs - you take manaflow and biscuits, I buy tear on first back (which often happens cause I'm oom with like 500 or so gold), then go into liandries through lost chapter, then build archangels..... and I'll run out of mana before basically every back that isn't a death or near death, and even those I'm often low (often the reason I die lol). I only stop having constant mana issues once I have both items and a fully stacked manaflow band, and even then I still occasionally run out on a particularly extended outing. Any more frequent/continuing mana issues would simply be unfun. And don't get me started on the amount of mana constraints I'm under when playing Cass.....\n\nWhile yeah, mana is less of an issue for a lot of champs, that's a good thing. Running out of mana is an unfun experience for most players, especially since using abilities are what make individual champs unique and fun. Wanting people to have to stringently use their abilities to conserve mana all the time isn't gonna be as enjoyable of an experience for most players. Mages - the class that it makes the most sense to have to deal with mana issues - still constantly have to struggle with mana. A scattering of other champions do as well. Mana costs aren't gone, they're just not as core of a thing gating everyone from playing as much. Sure a high level mage with many items and a stacked manaflow band won't run out of mana often, but that's the idea - they got to get to late game and fulfill the champ fantasy of being a spell slinging mage who blows people up all the time (or whatever the theming is). Mana costs constantly posing issues for everyone is not a fun gameplay experience.",

            "comment": "Wow, it's been more than 24 hours since I uploaded this video, and I just wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you who showed interest, shared, and engaged with it. I have to admit, I never expected it to generate this much attention, but I'm genuinely thankful that it did!\r  \n\r  \nNow, I want to take a moment to address a few discussions and clarify some points in the comment section.\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Firstly, the title was meant to capture the upbeat spirit of an article featuring Ryan Swain, an incredible professional skateboarder, who was attempting a skateboarding world record. Check out the article here: [https://www.gazetteherald.co.uk/news/23202314.ryan-swain-take-guinness-world-record-300-mile-skate/](https://www.gazetteherald.co.uk/news/23202314.ryan-swain-take-guinness-world-record-300-mile-skate/).\n\n\u2022 Let's be clear though, this video doesn't hold the actual world record for the longest Swain ultimate. There are players out there who have lasted even longer during a Swain ult, and I'm sure they have some truly impressive footage of intense team fights. If you're one of those players, please come forward and share your attempts with us! When I searched for Swain ult world records, I stumbled upon a video of a streamer who achieved a 1-minute and 4-second Swain ult with Sylas in diamond 3, and trust me, it's quite remarkable. Unfortunately, it doesn't qualify as a Swain record because, well, it's not Swain. Being Swain is a must for the world record. Check out the clip here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/xwwphs/longest\\_swain\\_ult\\_in\\_d3\\_solo\\_queue\\_1\\_minute\\_and\\_4/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/xwwphs/longest_swain_ult_in_d3_solo_queue_1_minute_and_4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\n\r\u2022 So, was the main purpose of this video to showcase the duration of my ult? Perhaps, but more importantly, it was to capture my genuine surprise when Mundo fell for Swain's deimatic display and got too intimidated to engage. My intention in that fight was to prevent Mundo from teleporting back to defend against Tristana's offensive, and I wanted to buy as much time as possible for a teammate to respawn and join me in securing the kill. Little did I expect the hilarious outcome of taking down that poor low Elo Mundo, and it had everyone laughing hysterically!\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 When it comes to playing Swain with style, it's all about cunning and zoning. You want to keep your enemies at the right distance, not too close but close enough to strike. Predict their next move, leverage the terrain, and make strategic use of your W for zoning and E for crowd control. Give them the tempting choice of stepping into your W or being pulled by your E, and if luck is on your side, they might even make the mistake of doing both! Either way, you'll be stacking up your passive. Let me tell you, I've never gained mastery points in a champion as quickly as I did with Swain. I absolutely love playing him!\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Lastly, I want to emphasize that I strongly discourage anyone from going in-game and harassing that Mundo player. We've all been in his shoes at some point, and heck, some of us still make similar mistakes with champions we've never tried before. Let's keep it friendly, folks, and remember, a big fat gg goes a long way!\r  \n\r  \nWith sincere appreciation and a passion for Swain,\r  \nMaze Mazaria",

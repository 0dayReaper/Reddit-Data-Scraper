    "postText": "TL;DR Ex-plat on a bronze loss steak, how do I motivate myself to get out of this?\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a few years since I played league ranked, trying to get back into it. I used to be around plat IV in S6, and consistently got gold (without much effort) in 7-8-9.\n\nI still played passively on the side during my \u201cbreak\u201d but nothing hardcore. I\u2019ve stepped back into the ring and got put in bronze III. Could have been worse. I went on a good win streak up to bronze I 97 LP, looking good to climb\u2026.until it inevitably come to an end.\n\nI\u2019m a support main, which is all fine and good until the games go out of my hands. My past 5 games have involved 1) ADC misposition 24/7 (I can\u2019t fix this) 2) junglers getting caught when objectives are up (even if I put down vision, ping roams, point out enemy jungler etc) 3) top lane being top lane aka one side running away with a lead.\n\nI know I\u2019m the only constant in my games, but over the past few, most people (other than myself) on my side have had KDA like 1/5/2, 0/12/2 etc. \n\nI can usually turn a neutral game into a win, but my experience is telling me in this elo that they don\u2019t know how to *stop* dying when behind or play defensive. I\u2019m great at doing this and finding our win con. I barely ever die to misposition or lack of vision.\n\nThere\u2019s been 1 game in the last 5 where my lane fell behind/lost due to an ADC dying 5 times before 12 minutes from walking up to far, getting caught. \n\nI\u2019m also aware it\u2019ll even out in the long run, but in the short term it\u2019s super irritating and making me feel kinda eh about the game. There\u2019s only so much I can do to \u201ccontrol\u201d my teams positioning. I also find myself to be the \u201cshot caller\u201d in most games I win, but when I\u2019m not, it tends to be a loss.\n\nDo I just keep playing until it sorta itself out? I\u2019m not \u201ctilted\u201d and what happened in the last game stays in the last game. If I lose two in a row I quit for the day, which is fair enough, so needless to say I\u2019ve played 1-2 games a day over past week. \n\nCurrent champ pool-Lulu, Seraphine, Lux, Rell, Swain.",

However in both instances I had times of long plateau or \"ups-and-downs\" from Silver 1 to Gold 1. I hope that shows our similar background.\n\n1. It is difficult to advance when you are thinking of how you are deserving of a higher rank. Accept now that you are at the beginning of the journey, not at the end -- you need to celebrate small improvements in gameplay and decisions, not tear yourself down for not getting perfect outcomes out of lane phase, or games. Choose 1 thing at a time to improve on, at 1 specific stage of game.\n2. While losses can come from poor plays of teammates -- ex: \"my jungler who spent 5 mins on top side of map with worst pathing, refusing RiftHerald call as enemy jungle took drake and forced dive onto us\" -- there is also an element of communication and shot-calling present in games that go from slightly behind or even, to complete loss. Most common example is how supports will not properly identify when a Baron call is possible, and then complain of \"winning lane but losing game\". In our ELO this is so rampant that I don't lose hope in losing positions, since enemy doesn't know to push objectives with gold lead.\n3. Champ pool is a big factor; you need a certainty in what your champ excels at, your matchups, how to execute those plays, what signals to look for when u decide on the action (push, freeze, poke, ambush, clear vision, etc.). I can play Lulu, but as a Bard main, I have less experience with Lulu's nuances (whether to Polymorph or AS-buff my adc, OR shield with E vs use E's burst dmg to finish fight).\n4. When you have narrowed your champ pool or practiced all relevant skills with the champs, you must review a game, see what surprised you in the game, and think about how you approached that play/gank/defense. What were you focusing on? How were you positioning, or using spells? Should you have saved CC abilities for the threat of jungler gank? Or were you committed to the push that would let you recall before any jungler could make it in time?\n5. For improvements, see guides and videos from people on YouTube such as Coach Cupcake, CoreJJ, Phroxzon (who later became Riot Dev and balance team leader, yet has excellent YouTube series on LoL concepts). Some high elo players will play champs completely different; Bard has 3 builds and playstyles by Cupcake, Lathyrus, and PolyPuff, each player believing theirs is most effective. So be aware that you can win in different ways, but at least with their perspective, you can add things to your gameplay.\n6. For all of this to not feel like WORK, you need to de-couple the win/loss from the time you spend playing LoL -- this part I am still trying to embody myself. You gotta enjoy the highlights of the game, more than seeing the LP go up. There are some people who skip or ignore LP screens.",

There are a couple of junglers who beat them level 3, and another handful that can outplay them. \n\nEven things like Udyr, Hecarim, Kayn, can duel them level 3 if they catch kindred face checking. \n\nAlthough, I don\u2019t think any champ (except maybe Rek\u2019sai or Elise) can \u201c destroy\u201d her pre 6.",

Good, safe pathing can also be a great way to avoid getting invaded by the kindred even in these matchups though. \n\nAlthough, trundle can outplay, especially if you take ghost. Use pillar to block her efforts to wall jump away. Not an easy outplay regardless, but certainly possible.",

Not only does give you way more pick potential late game by flash pillaring someone like the enemy mid or adc, it gives you way more 50/50 smite steal opportunities by flashing over walls instead of having to ghost through the enemy team\u2019s CC.",

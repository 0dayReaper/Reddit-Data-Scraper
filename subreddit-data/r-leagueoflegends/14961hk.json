Draft a Nautilus or something, get carries in every other role, and have support perma-roam while Jhin farmed under tower with Q and sometimes followed-up on teamfights with W and R.\n\nI've heard that teams usually FF early in scrims, and Jhin is a strong lane bully with good midgame teamfighting (hence his always good winrate in SoloQ - win lane, win game). His powerspike is *right* where teams would normally FF. However, current pro meta is *very* enchanter+hard carry ADC oriented. Teams baited into picking him right now might be overestimating how hard they're winning lane and underestimating how quickly well-coordinated teams can get their Zeri/Aphelios/Jinx back into the game and to 2 or 3 items.",

Compared to the best in the league on the best, most hyped teams his performance is not special but he is still very very good. His ezreal is a legitimate threat and I can see him shooting to top 3 if the patch favors him. His main problem is the early game but if he gets to his items, even if behind, he can blow even T1 up like in that Varus game cause he knows how to teamfight. Its rlly just if he can get enough gold by himself. He was also amazing on KT last year so give him his dues. He isnt well rounded enough to be considered amazing but he is good enough, and good enough adcs who can play with their teams have won worlds multiple times at this point. Or has the sub changed their mind on lwx and ghost again?",

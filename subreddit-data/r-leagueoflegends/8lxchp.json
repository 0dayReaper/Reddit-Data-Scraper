The Total Biscuit of Rejuvenation now known as the Total Biscuit of Everlasting Will. \n(Source: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Total_Biscuit_of_Rejuvenation)\n\nIn a way, through this game we all play he lives on, and the sincerest condolences go out to the work that he did and to his family.\n\nRest in peace John Peter Bain, may your soul find rest.\nJuly 8, 1984 - May 24, 2018",

At the time, the scan may have shown findings that weren\u2019t necessarily obvious and could have gone either way.  The public always assume radiology and pathology reports are black and white when there many situations that are gray.  But people always expect a definitive answer.  It\u2019s always easy to look back and claim a \u201cmistake\u201d when you already know the outcome.  \n\nOther possibilities include the doctor finding it and the patient dies anyways.  After all metastatic disease often means microscopic cancer cells are floating around in your blood stream.  No matter how many masses you find \u201cearly\u201d enough, you will get more.  \n\nAnd finally, what if the doctor overdiagnosed and he was actually negative.  Then if they treat more aggressively - many of the cancer treatments are quite deadly - he may end up dying from the treatment or from sepsis due to immune suppression from the chemo.  Maybe even earlier.\n\nBottomline, the public tends to think that if someone dies, a mistake was made.  I don\u2019t the doctors in this case so who knows, maybe there were mistakes, but I will say this.  In medicine, there are two kinds of mistakes that can be made.  There are mistakes that no one should be making (negligence), and there are mistakes that anyone could make.  Unfortunately for us, the public usually doesn\u2019t (or can\u2019t) differentiate and tend to cast blame for those mistakes.\n\nIn this case, the very real possibility exists that his survival of 2-3 years was the best possible outcome he could have hoped for.  Sometimes, there\u2019s just nothing that could have been done that would have been better.",

I don't really remember what my dad was like before cancer.  He went terminal in October and there are no words to describe what it was like to watch him go to functional and self sufficient to not even able to talk or eat or drink in a matter of weeks.  I'm grateful that I live in the state that pioneered stem cell transplants, which helped him to outlive his initial prognosis of 5 years MAX.  People really underestimate what donations and funding do to progress cancer research.  I miss him so so much and there's still times where I think \"Oh the doorbell rang, I bet dad is home\" before realizing that he's proooobably not going to be ringing the doorbell from his urn (lol).  Anyone who has the means to should consider dropping a little donation to a cancer research clinic, or donating to cancer wards and charities that help families of people with cancer.  It might not feel like it, but it really makes an impact. ",

But I think it was when I starting following the \"WTF is...\" series that I took more of an interest in games in general, and that was influenced my eventual career in game development. \n\nWatching him cast SC2, even though he wasn't as knowledgeable as some other casters, I remember thinking to myself that his posh British voice somehow made the competitions more real, made esports more legitimate to me. I'm gonna go watch some of his old StarCraft casts today. RIP TB\n\n",

He filled his bowl with cereal and noticed there was no milk. I called his name and said he can use the extra from my table. He accepted, grabbed the milk and started walking away. He then turned around and asked if it was ok to join me. Of course I said yes.\n\nFor some reason, he apologized to me for not saying hi the night before, and then we shot the shit for an hour. Absolutely incredible guy.\n\nHe will be missed",

Athene did the same in between that time, while the rest of us was convinced it wouldnt count. \n\nIm happier now we have something to remind us of tb in the game. Like Salt made way for grief ofc.

We happened to cross paths one night at a diner. He was by himself, alone in his thoughts as his eyes were stirring over his cup of tea. After nearly a decade, he was decidedly a very different man from what I remembered. I stood up, said hi and asked if I could join him. He accepted and we spent the next hour discussing life and the nature of this world and the next. He seemed to have a very grave appearance, fully aware of his own situation. We shook hands and I wished him the best. He ended up buying my coffee for me and tipping the waitress $100. He was a good guy with a positive impact and a willingness to learn. He will sorely be missed.",

    "postText": "I remember in 2018 when we had 3 western teams make it to final 4. There was hope that this year might be the year the west finally wins worlds by beating an eastern team.  \n\n\nThere was a hilarious video that put the three western teams icons over the faces on this video and I really want to watch it again but I can't ever find it. Was hoping someone here might know about it.  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPzIWFJU\\_3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPzIWFJU_3s)",

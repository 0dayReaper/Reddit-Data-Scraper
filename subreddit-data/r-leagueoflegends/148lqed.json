            "comment": "Learn about minions.  Not just CSing, but how the game flows around them.  This is very important when it comes to learning when to base or roam into other lanes.  This is also vitally important to know when to trade in laning.  Using minions to your advantage helps so much with objectives too.  For now, just learn about minions.  \n\nQuestion: how many minions does it take to hit level 2?  You need to know that because if you hit level 2 before the other guy, you'll get a bunch of stats and an extra ability.  Level 2, 3, and 6 cheese is so important to the game.  \n\nYou are a little too new to be learning about how to counter champs.  If someone annoys you, look up his kit.  Some like blitzcrank's rocket grope have a longish cooldown window where they can't really do their thing.  So if blitz Qs and misses, you know you are free do to stuff.",

            "comment": "In general, when you wish to be better at anything, spend more time watching a more experienced player than you. \n\nI watch many players such as T1\u2019s Gumayusi(ADC main here aha), Keria, Deft, Ruler. Whoever is at the top of whatever role you are playing. People on YouTube also break down their gameplay and what they are thinking abt when playing.\n\nSo what I like to do is go on YouTube and search, for example, Gumayusi Spacing, or Wave management. Or roaming. There are bunch of free videos and educational content available.\n\nNext thing would be to slowly improve over time, focus on one thing, master it, then go onto the next\n\nLast thing is to be patient, it feels great to be a god on the rift, but that only come from practise\n\nGood luck!",

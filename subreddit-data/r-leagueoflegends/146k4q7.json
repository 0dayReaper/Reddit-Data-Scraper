It requires correct timing of portal R just as it passes you, which became a lot harder after the Portal nerf (Q counted as being 'near you' the moment you cast the Portal, but the nerf made it so its' not until she pops up, so you have to cast Portal earlier, which is to say, you get to walk less), but still entirely possible. What I don't remember is if that nerf made it so that you can no longer reach 2550. If you can't, I am pretty sure it's just barely.\n\nThat is to say, the difference between a good Zoe max range Q is either the same as or at least no meaningful difference between this hexgate.",

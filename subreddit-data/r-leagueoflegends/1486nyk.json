    "postText": "I think there is no exact number that has been revealed yet for new LoL champions, but it seems that in 2023 we should be getting the same amount of new champions as in 2022. I think that getting four or five new champions a year seems feasible. \n\nIt is not confirmed this yet though and I'm just speculating, but in the last few years we've received around four to five champions yearly and with the amount of Mid-Scope updates, as well as other updates happening this number seems to likely stay consistent. what do you think\uff1f",

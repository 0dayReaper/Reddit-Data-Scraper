Master tier will become smaller and diamond tier only a little bit. I think up to D3 will be moved down to emerald to make space in diamond for the master players which will be pushed out of master.",

After this can you make a tier in-between silver and gold (or silver and bronze) cus there's a lot of people who shouldn't be in silver but not bad enough to be bronze but will also never hit gold and it's like 90% of the player base in one tier. Hopefully this change will effect this too but it sounds like it's just another tier of the many tiers that have been added for 1% of players in those tiers.

Promotions generally require you to play a bit better to rise in rank to begin with. Winning 3/5 or 2/3 so your mmr starts around low D3. \n\nDemotion Shield usually protects you for about 3 games, so yeah, it's possible to lose 5 games at 0 LP, 3 more games on top of that because of the Shield, then one more game to finally demote. \n\nThis is usually prolonged if you win a game or two from pure luck.

Since you lose 5 LP instead of the 20~ you should've lost. Anyone who has had a loss streak with 0 LP in a 4th division or lost multiple games with single digit LP over the course of the season has had their MMR to LP ratio damaged without any way to fix it other than playing 500+ games to equalise and hope you don't get into any situations where you damage it further.",

Since the LP gains and Losses also never really reflect the events in the game, you often feel betrayed by the game itsself.\n\nMaking the winning play after 40 Minutes to get 15 LP feels supershabby. So does loosing 30LP , despite playing well, or  playing against players much higher above your rank, but still getting less LP because you find out their MMR is lower than yours (which makes you feel double betrayed)\n\nI don't think the solution has to be individual LP, it's still a team game, but such high LP differences being the norm is just bad for the integrity of the ladder and your psyche.",

                    "comment": "&gt; I argue League should try \"true elo ladder\" once again - no promotion series, no demotion shields, instant promotions and demotions. Only downside is the anxiety it would cause in division 4 players who face demotion, but it could be better situation than the current one\n\nNext ranked split is already removing all promotion series and thus having all instant promotions and demotions aside from when you're demoting from a tier.\n\nI would argue that the main purpose of having demotion shields is literally to reduce the anxiety people feel when playing right after promoting or when they're on the verge of demotion. The whole point is to encourage people to play more instead of parking their accounts, and I'm relatively confident that Riot has survey data backing up the fact that many people would not be willing to play when teetering at the edge of a tier without the demotion shields being in place.\n\nAside from that, in the long-term people will either demote or not demote anyways, the only difference is a mismatch between rank and actual mmr in the short term. So when the outcome is either \"literally the same\" or \"players stop playing anyways\" you can see why there's no point in removing demotion shields because it's just a net negative. I would also argue that some would say it feels worse to constantly flip-flop between e.g. Gold 4 and Silver 1 than just having a demotion shield so you have space to build up an LP buffer against unfortunate loss streaks.\n\nFrom personal experience it's pretty annoying flip-flopping between Masters and D1 (no demotion shield) because I'm not a Challenger smurf who can guarantee a series of wins that prevents an unlucky streak from flip-flopping me.",

I can explain this further, but I think you can see the math behind this?\n\n&gt; losing like 2 games at 0 LP feels worse than just getting demoted for me because i know it's gonna effect my climbing by massive losses and small gains for like 10 games. \n\nI will say, as someone has previously been stuck on the edges of Plat 4 and Dia 4, I don't think losing 2 games at 0LP (or at any point) should do much to your MMR or affect your LP gains at all? The only possibility I see for this occurring is when your \"actual\" rank is around, say, Gold 2, but you winstreaked into Plat 4 and now the system is trying to make sure you actually belong there\u2014in other words, it's still trying to match your visual rank to your MMR, which is still back in Gold 2.\n\nI think this is a real conundrum, because some people are going to be very happy to winstreak into Plat 4, even if they fall back out, and some people are going to be very upset that they hit Plat 4 and then subsequently demoted (this is what the demotion shield is for).\n\nThe third group of people, however, can win just barely enough against the demotion shield (which works by demoting people who fall below a set MMR) so that they get, say, +15/-25, and remain Plat 4 even though they have Gold 2 MMR. For this third group of people, personal experience and my understanding of the system indicates that if you remain at a 50% winrate at Plat 4, the demotion shield will prevent you from falling **but** your MMR and LP gain/loss will remain the same (because you have a 50% winrate). You need to win more than you lose (obviously) in order to recover your LP gains, and the difference between the current system and the system that others are proposing is whether your visual rank is Plat 4 during this period or Gold 2.\n\nObviously, Riot wants people to have slightly inflated visual ranks in order to encourage them to climb. They think it's a worthwhile tradeoff in return for limiting LP gains once the discrepancy is too large. I think it might be worthwhile for Riot to test \"no demotion shield\" and see how it turns out, but I personally believe (as someone who has been around for the ELO system back in S1) that people vastly prefer the current, more forgiving system that makes people feel a little better about their progress (with the current tradeoffs).",

The problem with this is that if you're at 0 lp, it compounds to the point where you HAVE to win 2 games to not go back down to 0lp. you win one and get 22, but you lose one after and now you're -4, so your next games you perhaps get +21/-26. and it just goes on and on until you winstreak out of the bottom, but by then you're probably only getting +20/-27 or something because you've been stuck at the bottom for a while. which makes it easier to fall down, and the only way out is to winstreak out, but then the game thinks you just winstreaked out, so you have to winstreak out and then basically never lose streak down. it's an insanely frustrating system that only really punishes people who play a lot of games.",

The enemy players average around ~1500MMR. The player loses 5 games for -10 MMR each, putting them at, say, 1450\u2014except they didn't actually lose MMR, and instead all the enemies that the player played against jumped up +10 MMR without the corresponding decrease in MMR for the player. Instead of the player being at 1450 and the enemies from all 5 games being at, say, 1510 each, the player is still at 1500 and the enemies are still at 1510. Now the player is higher than their \"actual\" rank of 1450, with an extra 50 MMR present in the system.\n\nNow this happens a few thousand more times over the next few days as players promote and lose. Each player contributes an extra 50 MMR to the ranked distribution, skewing it upwards because thousands of people are 50 MMR higher than they should be. Adding on to this problem, tens of thousands of players have had \"easier\" than normal games because they're playing against a player who should be down at 1450 but was represented at 1500. Compounding upon this is the fact that playing against lower-MMR opponents should net you a lower MMR increase, but this isn't accounted for at all because the player was 1500 for each game.\n\nThis is kind of complicated but do you understand what I'm getting at?\n\n&gt; like +23/-25 which is probably about normal or so\n\nNormal gains are +25/-25. I want to make it clear that if you're experiencing gains of +23/-25 you're *already* a higher visual rank than your actual MMR. If you continue to lose, then clearly your \"real\" MMR is lower than your current MMR, and thus your LP gains will decrease. This is intended and is literally just how actual matchmaking/ELO systems work.\n\n&gt; and it just goes on and on until you winstreak out of the bottom, but by then you're probably only getting +20/-27 or something because you've been stuck at the bottom for a while.\n\nYou are at +20/-27 prior to your winstreak because of your series of losses. If you start up a winstreak, your LP gains will slowly recover as well. The thing is, if your visual rank matches your MMR, you *will* be experiencing +25/-25 gains. The visual rank literally doesn't matter, it will eventually adjust itself to your actual MMR no matter what.\n\nI understand that you see a loss streak and then a winstreak resulting in negative LP gains, such as your example of being at -4 after losing 2 and winning 2. However, this accounts for the fact that when you lose, you're against *easier opponents*, which means you're gaining less LP because your visual rank hasn't caught up to your actual rank yet.\n\nIn addition, this also means that if we flip your LP gains and losses, if you start the season off with a winstreak and then a loss streak you'll end up with a +4 LP gain despite winning and losing the same number of games. E.g. you're at +25/-23, winning 2 and losing 2 might put you at +4. This is because visual rank is slightly lower than your actual rank.\n\nEventually, you *will* catch up. Winstreaks will let you skip divisions. On the other hand, loss streaks won't drop you multiple divisions (though you will lose more LP per loss, up to a cap IIRC). This system is literally already biased toward the average person losing less LP for losses (demotion shield) and gaining more for wins.\n\n&gt; it's an insanely frustrating system that only really punishes people who play a lot of games.\n\nIt's actually the opposite\u2014in the long term, the people who play a lot of games will see mismatched visual rank adjusted to their actual MMR. For people who don't play a lot of games, their visual rank may lag behind their MMR if they're on a winstreak. And if they don't play enough games, they may never hit the divisions skips to have their visual rank catch up to their MMR.",

You could drop to 1400 and still be gold, but after you got below 1400, you would downgrade back to silver (arbitrary numbers for ranks because I don\u2019t remember what the mmr cutoffs were for the old system). This still acted as a \u201cdemotion shield\u201d but it was completely transparent to the player when you\u2019d demote instead of the sudden warning of \u201cLOL IF YOU KEEP LOSING, YOU\u2019RE GONNA LOSE YOUR RANK\u201d which I believe causes bigger anxiety to players.",

But the Demotion shield is a lot stronger than that (like 8 games?) and protects you with a lot more games. They could easily keep Promos and a Demotion shield if it were the same Game Value as the Promotion.\n\nThe Promotions would be a lot less jarring if people couldn't tank their promos for MMR gains and experiment a little less if they reached a higher tier.\n\n( They should at least try to retain a sense of special moment when you can reach a higher tier. But considering that the games often feel worse instead of better, there are certainly better ways to do that. Ideally everyone should sit in the same boat with the goal of winnning the game in one team. )\n\nInstead now you can still tank you MMR, but it is even harder to get it straightened out.\n\nYou could instead create a system with multiple MMRs for the Players with different Roles and Champs (or Fill) like a new Career in other games.\n\nThe fear of people sitting on their Tier is probably the highest in Gold. (Most players sitting in silver trying to get to gold) because thats where you get the big Prize.\n\nKeeping People from sitting on their rank in other forms would probably mean creating additional incentives in the form of completely new Skins and other Prizes to make people try to reach higher during the season apart from just having a badge.\n\nEven these Career slots could be a Prize to be gained that you'd otherwise have to buy (which you already do to get a new lvl 30 account right now from shady sources).\n\nHonestly the Fear of loosing players and players just pausing to struggle with the game is  holding back the evolution of the game.\n\nAt the moment they still try to make both work. Keep people playing AND less ressources allocated to additional prizes.",

Because I would rather have less of that Plat Garen otp suddenly choose to play Support for the first time in my game.\n\nMultpile MMRs on ONE account would allow this to be monitored a lot better. Besides. You could adjust the limitations of each Career. Create different challenges for that career. Like limited Champ pools, autofill only, otp, role or lane limitations and so on. These are just examples. Sure you might have to readjust some of the banning and matchmaking mechanics. But isn't that what we are doing right now?",

Creating another rank **anywhere** allows them to lower the high limit of bronze and silver, so that a bunch of current silvers will be gold.

The difference between a top 4% player and a top 14% player is ridiculously massive in comparison. That's why ranked distribution systems naturally skew downwards. This system completely undermines that.\n\nSince they want to artificially cap Diamond at ~4% players, this just means Emerald 1-2 will have LP gains like +8 -20. There's literally no way to achieve a curve like this without making the rank be an absolute hell LP vise. It will be absolutely miserable.\n\nAll they had to do was add Emerald, populate it with P1/D4 players and use that to stretch silver, gold and plat to be more even.",

Putting those players from gold into plat will drop the people that don\u2019t deserve master into diamond/emerald and then the hardstuck golds can finally be plat, and the silvers that are sitting with 51% winrate can finally be gold while the 50% winrate silvers sit in silver but now have a greater chance of finally hitting gold.

There's no other way to drop from 20% in emerald to 4% in Diamond (which is supposed to be smaller than this split too).\n\nWith a natural ranked curve where each subsequent rank has about 1/2 of the population of the previous one, you don't need to artificially skew point gains. With a curve like this with a drastic drop-off they will need to make sure you have to win significantly more games than you lose to get to Diamond.

The only reason the high elo ranks were flooded was the mmr reset letting plat and diamond players climb way too high on 50% winrates.\nYou can still look at the region ladder in master and see that like 80% of the players are sitting in master with like 500 games with a 50-sub 50% winrate.\nThat\u2019s not how it should be, those people should\u2019ve demoted long ago.\nThe new system is good, keep people where they should be while also still giving LP gains that would allow them to climb where they deserve to be.\nAnd why would it need to be +8/-20 if it\u2019s a new split. There\u2019s already a soft reset so it doesn\u2019t matter. Everyone would play their placements and go from there.\nThis isn\u2019t some random change being added mid season, it\u2019s added after the split, which means everyone plays 10 placements anyway. If people were sitting in diamond with a demotion shield with a 45% winrate let them place gold and earn emerald and subsequently diamond if they deserve it.\nWhile low elo players should have opportunities to climb I\u2019m tired of being 600 lp getting 3 challengers on my team and one random 1 lp master with a 50% winrate that inflated to 200 lp against other inflated plat-diamonds and then the integrity of the entire game hanging in the balance of our inflated player vs theirs. Not to mention like 80% of master+ players are first time master this year and it\u2019s not due to a healthy ladder, it\u2019s because of how insanely inflated everyone\u2019s placements were.\nI have to play from plat 2-1 and then through diamond to get to gm every year, meanwhile this year I was already diamond 1 mmr after placements and in master in like 15 games. Gains were way too much and the soft reset gave way too much inflation to the ladder.\nAdd emerald and let it be more spread to show people\u2019s actual rank. It\u2019ll also force boosters to up their prices cause now diamond+ will be an extra rank of grinding through to achieve.",

It literally has to be +8-20 outside of the first week of the season when people ride their rank reset MMR up.\n\nIf you have 20% of players in Emerald, but only want 4% of players in Diamond, the LP loss has to be significantly higher than the LP gain. Otherwise Diamond would have ~12% of the population. So Diamond 4 MMR will be artificially much higher than it should be (~800MMR above Emerald 4 instead of 400).\n\nWe've already had a system like this in seasons 3-5 and you'd sometimes get +2 LP for a win in Plat 1 while winning most of your games.\n\nI'm not saying they shouldn't have added Emerald or that the Diamond/Master inflation was fine. They just chose the worst option to fix it because it appeals to the players who have been stuck in silver all their life so that they can finally \"progress\" to a higher rank.",

Second, this just leads to severe elo inflation. More lp is constantly being added to the system artificially if you were to do that. Take valorant for example, you can climb with a 45% wr because of the performance bonuses. The average rank in valorant is plat which is a problem. High elo should never be a average rank in a competitive game.",

There are plenty of people that are brand new to the game or have a year or two of experience and climbed through silver/gold and higher.",

I'm not too keen on emerald being such a large fraction of the player base, bigger than current plat even, while diamond, for whatever reason, is still going to be that \"sort-of-elite-but-not-really\" tier that they're clamping down on. \n\nIt's just so odd to me that they're massively populating the new emerald tier and then creating a big gap between it and diamond. The lower to upper ends of emerald are going have a bigger variance between the lower to upper ends of current plat. It just doesn't make sense to me that emerald will have more players than bronze. Isn't it natural that lower ranks have more players in any skill-based distribution? But they're artificially flattening the curve while at the same time clamping down on diamond.\n\nIdk, I think I've always been a little bit annoyed about how diamond is handled since they force it to hang in that \"in-between\" space of elite and not, and it looks like they're going to still do that in the new split while inflating the tier right below it. Don't know if I'm articulating my thoughts well but I just feel like diamond always gets the short end of the stick because it's not handled like the \"regular\" tiers nor the elite tiers.",

If the majority of players are in silver &amp; gold, it's because they obviously don't have the time &amp; skill to play higher. To reduce the percentage distribution of silver &amp; gold, players would have to get better, or Riot reduces the barriers to advancement &amp; supports, or favors players of lower ranges, correct? Which then means that players who play in Platinum are now matched with players who obviously belong in lower elos.\r  \nisn't the health of the ranked broken with such a change?",

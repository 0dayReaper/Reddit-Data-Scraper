I'm not trying to climb, just play the game.\n\nLately, I've pushed into Plat 2 and I swear to God I don't know what I'm doing differently. I still get dumpstered in lane and feed fairly often, but it doesn't seem to matter.\n\nFor comparison, I'm silver 2 in flex queue and definitely am not carrying those games.",

Was also playing toplane which was never my role. I also know someone who was stuck silver for 10 years, but got gold this year. Someone else also said he heard similar stories.",

If your games full of plat+ players then you're probably actually a plat player, congrats. \n\n If you're getting silver-gold players then you probably went on some fat win streaks at some point and your MMR got severely mismatched from your display rank. In that case, you would be getting like +10 and -30 each game while the game tries to match your LP and MMR.",

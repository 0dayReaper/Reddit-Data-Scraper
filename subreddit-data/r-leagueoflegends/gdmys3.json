Riot hasn't made any effort because they don't want to or they're not capable. Should be very apparent as there has been no meaningful since a dinosaur like me can remember.\n\nTook years to crack someone as patient as Voyboy but as he explains it's just getting worse. Competitive spirit is dying more and more everyday and it feels monotonous grind is being promoted.\n\nEvery system including ribbons, tribunal, etc have been cancelled or failed.\n\nThere's posts from Hai, Bjergsen, Scarra if you look hard enough through search histories the collective opinion is there. GOD looking back is so AWKWARD but here's a post 6 years ago about me complaining about NA solo queue and having an open dialog about solutions.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1sjc73/twitter\\_clg\\_hotshotgg\\_na\\_will\\_always\\_be\\_the\\_worst/cdy6xse/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1sjc73/twitter_clg_hotshotgg_na_will_always_be_the_worst/cdy6xse/?context=3)\n\nI still believe my idea was great (which is essentially a rip off of GW and WOW). I just want players to have something to strive for that isn't unlocked by their wallet (Riot's fav) or spamming normal games. It's the WoW accessibility problem all over again. Everyone has to have access to everything here at Riot Games, Christ. Give us one cool thing to show off all the effort we've worked towards to become better players and don't quarter ass it like giving away 300 shitty jackets.",

The first thing that someone hears about league is about how terrible the community is.  I think maybe that it is too late.  They had the chance to do something early and it didn't succeed.  If they wanted to go with your idea of rewarding players for their rating it would have to be something worth a large amount of value.  Most people own all the champs, chromas are lame, and people expect skins through events and loot boxes. My thought is that the honor system( which sucks currently ) should change a lot more often.  Anyone below honor level 2 can't queue up for ranked.  The issue with that though is I don't know how you can make gaining/losing honor fair.  It definitely can't be left in the players hands because the now toxic people will fake report.",

But people get the rank they can get the reward they feel they can possibly achieve, and then just stop trying to get any further. They probably already know they've capped out at their skill level and have no realistic chance of getting any higher (if the higher rewards are even worth it to them). But they still play. Play knowing that they are no longer playing for anything meaningful. \n\nIt's that death of motivation to do well that is probably at the core of the problem and the best place to start a fix, even if it won't cure everything.\n\nPeople need to want to win every time they queue, or at least want to do well.

Voyboy makes them feel bad about themselves because he is a good person in situations in which they aren't able to be.\n\nThis is why streamers like tyler1 are liked by the community, too. They tell the community that toxicity is normal, and anger management problems are something to be celebrated. They stroke the ego of the playerbase we have. Voyboy simply existing makes League players angry because he shows them that they're not OK. They attack him to try to bring him down to their level so they can go \"See, he's no better than us\". Alternatively, if attacking him makes him go away so they aren't reminded of their failures, that's good too.",

Riot's punishment system is ultimately weighted towards people who use toxic language, instead of people who tank games - and while I concede it's a lot harder to detect the latter, in my experience people who get angry and type in chat do so because they want to win. It ultimately comes from a winner's mindset, while people who feed, or give up at 5 minutes, or abandon lane, effectively do so because they have a loser's mindset.\n\nI ask you, which is worse?\n\nI'd rather have a team of people who use profanity and expletives but try to win over a team of pathetic limp-dicks who give up at the first hint of adversity but never type in chat.",

Not in a toxic way, but more in a frustrated manner. I've never seen him do that, but I felt really bad cause I could feel all the pain he's been experiencing this season.",

He did it to Flyquests top laner Solo just this past week while playing with TL Broxah. Solo was playing ez and just afk split pushing/dying over and over in a very winnable game. Broxah tried to reason with voy by telling him to let it go so it doesnt get to him/tilt him. Voy explained that Solo has been doing this since season one and is a known offender for doing this thing. Its pretty pathetic when your friend or random does this in your games but for a professional player to be doing this in ranked is inexcusable. Pro players and streamers need to be held to a higher standard when playing the game bc their actions influence others. Prime example is T1 fan boys trying to emulate their idol by acting a fool and running it down mid bc theyre alpha as fuck. Sry rant over\n\nEdit-T1 as in Tyler 1 not SKT. Thank you RussianBearFight for bringing that up",

You absolutely do not want to end up in low prio. You get low prio automatically if you leave/afk/abandon more than 1 game in your last 25 games - that 1 game is basically like one \"free\" abandon in the case of people having internet issues and such, because Valve realizes how harsh the punishment is. You can also get low prio via excessive reports.\n\nHow does low prio queue work in Dota? First, it puts you in the matchmaking pool of other low prio players, so right off the bat your games are filled to the brim with ragers, leavers, and griefers. Second, you don't even play the regular game mode - you play this called \"Single Draft\" which basically randoms 3 heroes for each player and you can only choose from those 3 heroes. Effectively, what happens is everyone picks the greediest hero of the 3 and the game becomes 5 carries vs. 5 carries. \n\nIn order to get out of low prio queue, you have to win games. I believe the default number is 1 game, but it goes up to 3 at your second offense. This doesn't sound like a lot, but keep in mind it is HARD to win low prio games, not to mention incredibly draining emotionally. It makes you not want to play Dota at all. \n\ntldr: low priority queue is an absolute nightmare and acts as a HUGE deterrent to leaving and AFKing.",

Which means that if you play 100 games you should mathematically average out to a 50% winrate. Maybe 60% if you are a high ranked player.\n\nBut practically speaking, we're not working with that kind of sample size. Sometimes you'll blaze through your low prio games winning 3/3 games. Sometimes it'll take you 8 games to win 1. \n\nWinrate aside, these games, like I said, are draining as well. You are literally queued up with the scum of Dota players, who are already notorious for being one of the biggest assholes in the gaming community. They just aren't fun. They feel worse than chores. I'd rather work or study than play a low prio game. I'd rather do leg day than play a low prio game. You're stuck playing with 4 people you hate, on a hero you don't like, in a lane for which your hero is likely not suitable. If someone on your team abandons (very likely, btw), you still have to play the game out and there is no surrender function.",

Every report will decrease the behavior score while long disconnects and certain words will automatically lower the behavior score. Reports that are accumulated in a short period of time impact the score more. If you get reported enough, you are automatically punished. The amount of reports you need to be punished is based on your behavior score.\n\nPlayers have a limited number of reports. They gain more reports over time to a limit and regain their report +1 if they reported a player that was eventually punished. You have to choose what is worth reporting and the Dota 2 community chooses mostly feeding and griefing over chat abuse because mutes in Dota 2 will permanently mute the player even in future games. There may be some modifier as to how heavily reports are weighted for the typical player but not usually.\n\nThis report system works much better automatically than Riot's manual system except one: high-profile players are reported more often usually just for the memes. The way Valve fixed this was making high-profile players manually reviewed rather than automatic. \n\nNow for the punishment system that is the most different from any other games:\n\nThere are four types of punishments you can receive in Dota 2. Global mute(works similar to League), low-prio, temp-ban, and perma-ban. Temp-banning is similar to League except the durations can be for months(I think up to 6 months) so they can feel permanent. Perma-bans are the same. Low-priority is where most players end up and is easily the most punishing.\n\nBeing in \"low-pro\" in League means just waiting a little while before you can queue for X number of games. Low-prio in Dota 2 means you can only queue up for a single mode (no ranked) for X number of games where you are given random heroes to play. You have to win the game to count so people in this mode tend to be the most toxic. If anyone leaves on either team, the game is nulled and you receive nothing for participating. If you are the one to leave, your low prio game count is reset, and maybe even extended past, the original amount. If you join anyone's party, they are forced to play low-prio as well. This is a hellish punishment that can cause players to quit entirely.\n\nTL;DR: automatic punishments based on limited reports, hellish punishment system.",

Even, and I think LS mentioned this sort of panopticon effect, you don't have to actually review every game, just because people know they might be watched by someone they'll behave differently.\n\nI also agree it would help because perceptions about the meta being bad come from experiences with bad games, and I also wonder how much that filters down from streamer attitudes.\n\nMy once caveat is I also think a lot of frustrated people are just blaming meta/toxicity when in reality they're just burned out of the game and that's why they're miserable. Even more so for a lot of streamers/pros, they've been playing for months and years. Kinda sucks to have to play constantly because it's your job but yeah.",

Every month or two there would be a new initiative where they tried something different, were very public about it, and after a while everyone just kind of knew that it was something Riot was really trying to address and that they were watching.\n\nI honestly can't remember the last official word from Riot besides \"just report them.\" It feels like they just kind of gave up on that front. What's messed up is that might not even be true because obviously we don't know what they are doing on a daily basis, but they don't even talk about it anymore so the assumption is that they don't care anymore.",

Sure people like IWD get flamed by the community, but then you have people like Tyler1 and NB getting 30k viewers for essentially flaming and running it down every game.            \nThen you have a good number of pro players just run it down as well. You'll see a ton of pros complain that solo queue isn't competitive and that it's not a viable way of practicing, but they're also a huge reason themselves that it sucks. For the majority of the people on the ladder, even in high elo, we're people who play the game as a past time. Then we finally reach the top of the ladder and we're met with pros who essentially just run it down. Nisqy is a huge one. He's literally on the current #1 team in the continent, but he's a notorious coin flip player who doesn't try his best to win. It doesn't sound like a huge issue until you realize that everything starts somewhere, and it's a huge gradual accumulation that ruins the majority of games. What I mean by this is that even with just 1 pro in Nisqy running it down, he tilts 4 people on his team in 1 game alone. They bring it to their next game and play worse as a result, and then suddenly the number of tilted players increase exponentially. And that starts with just 1 player not trying. With high elo being as small of a community as it is, it really doesn't take that much to make games feel terrible.         \nIf people want solo queue to be improved, it starts with Riot and pros/streamers holding themselves to actual standards. It means nothing to trash on the ladder when it's convenient for them, and then be the reason it sucks in their next game. Pros/streamers especially should be held to a higher standard since they're literally role models for everyone else, but if anything, they get more leniency and almost never get punished. It's a joke that it's persisted for as long as it has, and needs to have actual consequences.",

I loved interacting with the other players, working as a team, and competing to climb the ladder. I\u2019ve been through all ranks from silver to masters. I\u2019m glad somebody has finally spoken up about how player behavior has become increasingly worse throughout the years.\n\nI\u2019ve never considered myself toxic nor have I\u2019ve been punished for any behavior within the game. But I can say this: throughout the years, my behavior towards other players have slowly changed. I\u2019m more aggressive, hostile, and acted in ways I would never think I\u2019d stoop down to. I\u2019ve always tried my best to win without any negative behavior in the past. But playing with an increasingly amount of toxic teammates can take a toll on you. I started to get extremely frustrated with negative behavior from my teammates which made me reflect that negative behavior towards other players in my future games. I know I cannot be the only player who has picked up bad habits of negative behavior out. After I realized this, i decided to quit playing all together. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the community or the game itself, but I completely lost all interest in playing league.\n\nI see new players post on this reddit discussing about the issues of toxicity in early level games. A lot of experienced players respond and say \u201cjust mute all\u201d and this really irritates me. The fun of playing online games is working with a team and communicating to achieve a single goal. I felt like I am defaulted to muting all each game which makes the game really stale for me.\n\nAlthough the nature of online competitive games is overall toxic, I really don\u2019t believe it\u2019s okay to just accept it, acting like it\u2019s the norm and it will always be this way. I think riot should be actively trying to tackle this situation along with our community.\n\nThis is also all just my own personal opinion. Hope this is heard and I hope I can develop love for this game again.",

            "comment": "Nothing will change until Riot does some type of HUGE overhaul. Tribunal, harsh punishment on streamers, setting strict rules and enforcing them by not only bots but human resources.\n\nIt's like a virus. As people get griefed more and more and see that it's the norm they will in turn do the same thing. I'd be lying if I said I sat and sweated every game I played when some dude with 3k games, 48% wr, first timing a champ is just solo making the game unplayable because he has nothing else to do with life. Most people know they won't be punished for just alt f4ing or AFKing, and it's pretty damn hard to punish soft inters.\n\nI think if the game itself was better (client, different type of balance, big rewards for tryharding/climbing/not being toxic) then people would feel inclined to not brain off 5 minutes into the game. Valorant sorta did this with making you lose less 'MMR' if you played well or grabbed as many rounds as you can. Obviously this is very difficult to do in a moba and would probably take a year to create a proper system but it could be hugely beneficial. You can afk and lose 20 LP or deal damage, block damage, do CC, etc and lose maybe 10-15.",

Riot is a billion dollar company that up until this year has been built completely on a single product. It's not and essential product either. It's literally one piece of entertainment media that has carried the company to this day.\n\nNow, they're about to blow up with a bunch of game releases in already hotly contested markets; Legends of Runeterra which has to compete with Hearthstone and Magic; Valorant which has to compete with so many other shooters; Project L their fighting game which has to make a splash in the incredibly finicky FGC; and of course Wild Rift which will have to compete with Tencent's own mobile MOBA in China. If any one of these games ends up going belly up, which I think is actually quite probable, it's going to be an awful look for the company.\n\nThat means they can't risk shaking up the regular League playerbase. They don't want to remove the toxic trolls because toxic trolls do also spend money on the game. They're also confident enough in their market share in MOBAs and F2P gaming that they know disgruntled players that have to deal with this aren't as likely to leave.\n\nLeague's golden era is over. If you want to keep playing, I suggest adopting a significantly more casual mindset because between the issues with the community, the issues with the balancing, and the increasingly profit driven decision making, you're just not going to be rewarded for investing your time and energy into this game anymore.",

That's actually so pathetic. I don't care if someone has a bad connection or something, if you leave more than like one game every once in awhile it should be an insta suspension. It's very unfair to other players to have to deal with that garbage when there isn't any sort of leave early mechanic or anything like that.\n\nI know people are going to say its recency bias or w/e on my part, but this season has legit been the worst season for me in terms of getting AFKs on my team.",

You lose all your objectives and get wiped if you try and contest when behind. The general attitude is just that people would rather just quit a game if they start getting behind even if they could win it rather than waste time.

I'm not much of a gamer, so I don't know if this is an esports-wide problem, or if other games have it more or less under control, but there's literally no respect for any of the people you're queuing up with, and it ruins the dynamic of a team based competitive game. \n\nToxicity is a problem, but I honestly wouldn't even mind being flamed if I felt like the person overall had respect for me as a player and a teammate and was lashing out after making a mistake in a high pressure situation. But people lash out over anything and everything and when they do lash out it's absolutely to try and degrade the person rather than angrily react to a poor play. I've had times where I've apologized for misplays and accepted fault for shit and the person still doesn't get over it and like spams ff and runs it down. Like I genuinely don't know what they want out of the game.\n\nI really think that having a system in place that rewards sportsmanship might be really helpful. Expand the honor system which imo is pointless right now and no one cares about it. Let people honor as many people as they want, and if you don't give/receive enough honors throughout your games have some sort of punishment. Maybe put in a low priority queue or something. I don't know, I'm not a professional in charge of this problem. But the utter lack of sportsmanship among people who play the competitive mode of this game is honestly so awful.",

    "postText": "Close matchups and crazy action marked our second week of LPL, and we\u2019re just getting started! Although many are looking ahead to the return of the king Uzi, let us first take a look back at how this week panned out:\n\n**MVP of the Week:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9rowz8dkp5b1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0a4005ff684aa6d4d1eb21a281b5e07d584f20f6\n\nJDG put their doubters DOWN this week. After a slightly shaky week one, they put the hurt on two very solid teams in EDG and OMG, with two sweeps. Critical to these wins was the man you see here - the golden left hand Knight. No matter how easy some people will say Annie is - few can make her look as easy as a man as talented as this, as he used her to send OMG back to meet their maker. And if JDG really starts hitting on all cylinders again - it may just be over for the LPL already.\n\n**Rookie of the Week:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/an9iuzdekp5b1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dd495457f5faeb2828b42cf4f32d40f654fe21be\n\nToplane, being a role for those as solid as a rock, is often the victim of having rookies struggle with stability. That has not been the case this week with Rare Atom\u2019s toplaner Xiaoxu, who looked like a seasoned veteran out on the rift against FPX and LGD. Be it obliterating enemies with Jax or \u201c\u201dplaying safe\u201d\u201d with Sion, nobody seems to be able to stop him - earning him a well-deserved Rookie of the Week!\n\n**Positional Standouts:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3pszvi0gkp5b1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a67289a4af5cdde92c73f675cb388edffcc3884b\n\nSpeaking with all honesty, is anyone surprised by this lineup? With the addition of our Rookie of the Week Xiaoxu, these guys are all people who should be expected to dominate - who went out and dominated. JDG looked just like the team who just won MSI, and TES catapulted off the back of Jackeylove to take three series this week. BLG as well took down EDG and UP, much due to the solid aid from their support ON.\n\nTune in next week for some of the most exciting series yet - and the possible return of a great. Catch every second on Twitch or Youtube, we can\u2019t wait to see you there!\n\n**Week 2 Standings:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9m204upkp5b1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8c39cfee06ebb92f1b5a0709ce4a847fb992ae64",

RA and UP haven't performed against good teams meanwhile almost all of the top teams played at least one to two BO3s against another good team.\n\nClearly JDG+BLG are in the first tier, with WBG,LNG,EDG,OMG and TES in the second tier, then everyone else in the 3rd tier. So I would say 5 teams contending for the last two spots at worlds, with some lower-tier teams looking to make a run (WE and NIP imo, RNG looked decent at times too)\n\nThe five contenders all have their strengths and weaknesses and after week two I really dont see any of the five pulling themselves out of that second tier any time soon, with EDG being the biggest mystery with the addition of Uzi.",

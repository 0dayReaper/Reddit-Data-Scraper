Blindly downvoting like that should be.\n\n\nZileans can max any of his 3 abilities first and be ok.\n\n\n3 points in Q should be mandatory because of lane pressure. Maxing it first afterwards is good because it scales non linearly but you miss out on utility. But sometimes you need to start putting points in E for safety \n\n\nE max first is good vs no dash enemies, even if they are mobile, if they rely on speed boosts you will break their knees. Points after 3 give somewhat diminishing returns because of caps, 3 points is usually enough for about everything you need to do\n\n\nW max is good for generally uptime on all your abilities, I would say it's a priority vs E max first if enemies have ways to deal with a massive slow and you value uptime more than damage on Q\n\n\nDon't sleep on W. It's as good as the other two once you have points in E",

I also liked to put an extra point into my E early to make it even easier.  \nWhen roaming (after buying Shurelya) I would first use Shurelya to close distance and save my E for slow (to use the mentioned combo). Afte they get unstunned I would then have another E slow waiting for them.  \nZhonya is great item for Zilean. It gives you protection so you can use ult on teammates rather than yourself.  \nWhen enemy had a lot of immobile champions that would like to go all in, like sett, jax..

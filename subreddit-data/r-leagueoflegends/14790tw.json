Just because someone is older doesn't mean they never want to play in LCS again. So what metric can we use other than age? Solo queue rank? \n\n\nImo all the players playing in NACL (and amateur/collegiate) are there because their end goal is to be in LCS. It's not fair to any of them, especially the ex-pros, to say they have no LCS aspirations. Stixxay was \nthe GG Challengers coach before playing on the team and getting the call-up to LCS, culminating in an MSI run. Dhokla dropped his ego and went down all the way to Tier-3 competition (playing on the original incarnation of Wildcard Gaming with Arrow and Bradley), only to perform well and get called up to TL Academy, then CLG Academy, and is now back in LCS.\n\n\nIn the end, whether someone *should* be in LCS is different from whether they *want to be* in LCS.",

In order to actually have a chance at creating good rookies in the league then we need to have as many good players old or young competing in the academy as possible. This increases the strength of the league and that increases the talent created by the league. It also gives young players a chance to prove themselves against the older players which is their best chance at getting promoted.",

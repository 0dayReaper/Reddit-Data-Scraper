    "postText": "threaded volley has got to be the worst design ive seen, the ability hurls rocks in only direction that cant be changed and it shoots them all. it should be redesigned as an ability that when used, its active for 10 seconds during the 10 second you recast 5 times (1 recast per rock) so now you can actually snipe and hit individual people with it. the rocks will be around her for 10 seconds as she moves freely. keep the same cooldown it has but give it the option to shoot one at a time in any direction. the ability felt unfinished when i tried it and thought it was bugged that she just shoots in one direction.",

            "comment": "No, simply no Volley is a well designed ability and part of Taliyah\u2019s skill expression is the ability to land her Q on enemies.\n\nLimitations are what make abilities interesting, Jax\u2019s leap having to be targeted to something, Sejuani\u2019s ult being weaker at close range, or Graves auto being body blocked.",

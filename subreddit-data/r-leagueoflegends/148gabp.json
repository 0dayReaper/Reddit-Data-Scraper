However, due to server tick rate, this might or might not happen. Sometimes she can't hit back, but other times she can.\nEither way, yes, range has a lot of weight in pro play matchups",

You are forcing MF to do something in lane against one of the safest adc picks out there. Plus you can easily turn a bullet time into a kill if you have e up as ez.",

Jhin also can run away pretty well and prevent draven from engaging on him so it becomes a pretty uninteractive lane and then jhin outside of lane can just press r for teamfights and has a w + e. Draven generally struggles vs champs that are hard to punish in lane which generally means champs that can neutralize the lane (go even) or they are lane bullies as well. \n\nCaitlyn is one of the hardest draven matchups because you can\u2019t actually run at her. She just has 100 auto range over you and she has her e which prevents you from trading and she will chunk you for free. Seraphine is another cancer matchup because in a 1v1, she will just slow you and maybe even root you with double cast if you try to attack her and she just has way better teamfighting with r.",

As well as the unspoken part that Ashe's passive only counters Kalista *if she's jumping* but any Kali player who is worth their salt knows that hopping reduces your DPS and will stand still when eating a slow as long as it'll win them the fight with rend.\n\nAlso it's heavily understated but Cleanse on Kalista is very strong as well as swifties are an incredibly potent buy on Kalista because her new build allows her to overcap on attack speed so easily. I'm a 1.5m Kalista main, so you'd be shocked how much I play the Ashe matchup because the hop/slow interaction is so commonly known.",

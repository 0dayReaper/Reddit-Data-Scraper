RIOT has a ENORMOUS community on his hands, with a lot of creative people among them.  \n\n\nidk why riot never did something like this and why they removed the custom games with the custom game mode of the week, on old days of league you could create a custom game on the ARAM map with URF as example, they removed that.  \n\n\nThere is a lot of people that just want to have fun with league without try harding on the Rankeds, and having something like this will make the game feel a lot lot better.",

They do this to prevent cheats from being made easily and avoid certain exploits that happened back in the day. \n\nleagues codebase at the end of the day isnt built for giving the level of freedom you want, its just that honestly. they can't just make the tools since theres nothing there to work with to make said tools so unless they do a massive code rewrite which would be expensive and time consuming even then might not be worth it in the long run (look at wildrift which is dying compared to pc league thats growing).",

The core of League of Legends is old and was made by a bunch of interns who didn't really know what they were creating. They never expected the game to blow up like this. They never knew what types of designs would be added 10 years down the track either, because they figured it probably wouldn't last that long. Compared to something like Dota2 which was actually developed by a AAA dev company with this modding ability in mind, League of Legends is really hampered. \n\nIt also creates a little more space for cheaters and third party apps. But an in game tool like Halo's Forge or DOOM 2016's Snapmap would be a good middle ground I think. It would just need to coincide with League of Legends being built from the ground up.",

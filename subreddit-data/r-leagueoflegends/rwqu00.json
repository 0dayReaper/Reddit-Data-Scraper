But why this skinline and not one that'd make sense to even half a braincell.\n\nI'm still surprised that we literally are getting a fireworks skinline and a porcelain skinline and the character that could fit for both, who hasn't gotten a skin in like 1300 days or something didn't get one. Where's the Firecracker GP that makes his barrels those fireworks batteries, or where's Porcelain GP who plonks down Ming Vases for his Barrels.",

Battle Academia is nice but it just doesn\u2019t scratch that itch. I used to think it\u2019s the best skin in the game but now I feel like it\u2019s just missing something. The mythic skin isn\u2019t even really anything but a golden shine on a 1350 skin, is it really worth complaining about him getting? \n\nPorcelain based on the animations and the sounds seems like a really good and more than easily his best skin now. I own almost all the Ez skins barring like SSG and explorer and I still end up using Frosted Ezreal the most. \n\nSure this is all subjective and not really a justification or defense of him getting an added skin, my point is just that somehow almost all of those Legendary+ aren\u2019t up to snuff quality wise.",

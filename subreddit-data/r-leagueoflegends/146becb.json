    "postText": "I'm level 14, and I think I just played my last game probably ever.\n\nI've watched hours of videos explaining how builds work, how to properly lane, how to auto cancel, the role of each lane, etc. So, I think I'm doing a fairly good job at learning how to play the game, especially compared to what I'm assuming most players do.\n\nWith that being said, I try loading into a few normal matches, and I get absolutely destroyed by people who are apparently \"level 4\" and yet are somehow going 27/2. Not only is that entirely unfun and impossible to play against in lane, but my \"level 8\" teammates are spam pinging me and telling me to uninstall because I'm trash, AND it takes me roughly 12 minutes to find a match in NA.\n\nSo, I thought, maybe I'll try the Co-Op vs AI mode, because playing normal sucks when literally everyone is a smurf and telling me to end my life...\n\nI swear to god, those are the absolute DUMBEST AI I have ever played against in any game, EVER. It makes the AI in Redfall look like how people act in real life. Even then, I still have teammates getting pissed at me for not playing perfectly every single game.\n\nI don't understand how you're supposed to get good at this game, especially when playing alone. I can't play vs real people, cause I spend the entire time getting ganked and flamed by people who play this like a job... And I can't play vs the AI, cause I learn absolutely nothing by playing against something that is dumber than a literal wad of moist toilet paper.\n\nWhat am I expected to do? I really like Smite, and I \\*want\\* to like this game... It just seems impossible to start.",

The only nice thing is there are far less Smurfs in dota shitlo (still a LOT, but when I was grinding to lvl 30 in league every game was like 9 Smurfs) but it takes far longer to learn the proper intricacies",

The disadvantage would be taht you switch champs everytime. The advantage would be that you can learn faster what the champs are doing.  \nAs i saw this beginners guide, I thought it might be helpful:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQbo2X2Qysc&amp;t=20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQbo2X2Qysc&amp;t=20s)  \n\n\nFor summoners rift it is propably very important to play simple champs, to just get a feeling for the game without bothering for mechanics",

I'll eventually come back for more ranked, at least that's what I've been saying, but I dunno when. Imo DotA has a lot more outplay and teamplay potential and so is more fun to watch, too. The team fights and stuns and disables, etc. are more dynamic imo. The engage range is like double compared to League. Crazy stuff can happen, and yet it feels balanced. As a support main in both games, the saves and disables are a lot stronger and longer duration.",

MMR exists in EVERY matchmade queue.\n\n The problem with alternate accounts is that for any given player, the effective duration of disruption is multiplied many times over.

You probably have a slight grasp of a couple aspects, but there are many more aspects to learn and it takes even more time to master.\n\nJust take it with small steps: Can you actually get close to 100cs in 10 min? Can you actually manage mana well? Wave management? Back timings? Matchups can be very intricate and complex. How about jungle paths, even when not jungling so you can manage ganks/help a teammate out? Obvious warding spots? 2v2/3v3 skirmish matchups? Trading objectives? Item builds, especially adjusted to the specific game/matchup? Perhaps its worth giving up in a certain area, like cs, to force the enemy even further behind? \n\nJust pick one and get yourself a good benchmark and start tracking it. When you load into a game, everyone is the same strength. Learn when it starts to shift in the opponents direction. Figure out the difference in their decision making. Etc. Perhaps this is all a bit too advanced, but since you mentioned you felt you are not a beginner that much, this might show you some of the depth you might encounter over time.\n\nTake it slow and imo there is plenty to learn even against bots or custom games. Things like cs'ing, wave management, builds and pathing are generally pretty good goals in less competitive mods. But just use the mute all function in game and enjoy yourself. Figuring out what works for you is only something you can do. We can give angles and options, but you decide. That is what the game is about :-)",

The game recognized your prior moba experience and is matching you with smurfs because it showed your performance against actual new players was way to high vs the average. This is a bit of an awkward situation for you though because on one hand, you are new, but your also better then other new players by a lot but no were near experienced enough yet to compete with smurfs. You will just have to tough it out for now though and reach a higher level which will start to balance your matchmaking some. Best bet is to just mute all every match and focus on your own gameplay while you learn.\n\nActual new players wouldnt have done as well as you early on when you first started and wouldnt have been put in smurf queue. They play against other newer players just fine. I know this because my cousin is brand new to League and has absolutely no prior experience and it shows when he plays. He almost never plays against smurfs in his games and its a lot closer to his skill level overall. He did play against some smurfs early on when he first started, but it didnt last long.\n\nNow his complaint is that when he watches me play or plays with me and then plays his own games, he just now realized that the people dont play the game correctly and he learns bad habits. He feels he improves faster when he plays with me since even though he gets wrecked, he learns the proper way to play at least.",

Getting abused by everyone in your team all game because you've played literally 3 matches and they have 1000s of hours was genuinely upsetting. So I feel your pain, the matchmaking will even out once the system realizes you are actually new but its shit untill then and I don't blame you if you quit",

I was playing in the top 3% in dota (back in the beta when your matches had the \"very high skill\" flag in the match history). But in league I'm bouncing around the mid point of skill. I enjoy League way more though.\n\nMatchmaking should very rapidly put you into matches where you get a 50% win rate - is that not happening? Maybe you care too much about what the other people in the match think of you, I just mute everyone and treat it as a bot game. I'm particularly excited and love it when I see a 20-0 player in the game because I can watch the replay from their point of view and marvel at how skilled they are.\n\nThe gameplay loop I like most in league that for me to stay long term is getting S rank performance on a champion which gives you a lootbox. It's like a personal challenge to improve yourself and you can sometimes get the S rank even if your team loses. It's not something tied to your MMR and you can just slowly and progress through all the Champions each year and then it resets in January.",

Keep watching streamers you enjoy that are good at the game especially if they explain their thought process, I challenge you to find a role that you like and try out some free champs til you find one that just clicks or if you see a streamer and you like their play style try to imitate it. if you want to give up I don't think anyone blames you. this game has a high skill floor compared to other games and an even higher skill ceiling since it's an ultracompetitive game.",

No. Cause I was dead 90% of the time, in a lane where the opponent has a 4 level lead.\n\nIf the only way to play against people similar in skill, is to spend 100hrs to hit level 30...

But it's the nature of competitive games. If getting combo'd is enough for me to quit playing the game, then I clearly don't want to play that game, or I'm not mentally cut out to even attempt to learn the game.\n\nPlaying **rocket league** I never got much higher than gold to be honest. But in that game, my first games were people flying above me with the ball and hitting trick shots on an empty net and spamming techskill which to me looked completely foreign, they were playing a different game. It seemed like their car just had better \"upgrades\" even, but it was an even playing field, and I was just not good. I barely even get to touch the ball, let alone functionally control my car.\n\n**Apex legends** you get sniped from half way across the map and lose all your armor and you have no idea why, or where the shot came from. Then suddenly they're air strafing and b-hopping and wall jumping off of shit and meleeing you because they know you suck. Meanwhile you can't even shotgun the fucker because he's moving around like a wasp on crack cocaine.\n\n**Valorant** you don't even know what gun to buy or when to buy it. People are yelling at you to kill yourself and save the gun (what does that mean?). You end up standing in a place where you get spotted and die. Next round you swing wide completely exposed and get killed from an angle you didn't even know existed. Your death happens in 0.1 seconds and you have to spend an entire round watching your team struggle 4v5.\n\n**Starcraft**. Where do I even start? It's fucking starcraft, one of the hardest competitive games in existence. You have to be able to think of 900 things and silmultaneously have the bare minimum requirement of being able to type 80+ WPM on your keyboard. Then you notice they're cannon rushing your workers and they all die.\n\n**Elden Ring.** Not even a multiplayer game, but I promise that 99% of people did not kill the first boss, in their first try. Simple as that. Dying over and over to the same boss is enough to make most of the playerbase quit, and that's fine. You don't like the challenge, and you want to succeed, or win, or your metric of fun is different from others. But for some, that failure, makes the victory sweeter, and even the failure itself is enjoyable, because the reward is not that your character gets stronger. It's that YOU get stronger.\n\nI get that it's hard. I'm not denying that. But all competitive games are hard in their own way, and none of them are easy to learn, and they only get harder as the game lifespan goes on. If you quit at the first instance of friction because you're not winning, or you're dying to much, or the enemy is scoring more than you, or you can't hit all your shots. Then maybe just go play cookie clicker or something.\n\n***TL:DR*** \\- Massive rant, not specifically directed at you, more just in general. But I'm so tired of seeing people complain about \"X\" video game is hard. Don't fucking play it. Or push past the first barrier you meet and be better. It's not that you can't play the game, it's that you don't want to, and that is also fine.",

Honestly the most fun I\u2019ve had with playing League as a relatively new player (for 2 years playing) was the first &lt;50 levels when I still didn\u2019t know everything. I found everything so fun and amusing especially as I was playing with friends who I know wouldn\u2019t judge me as a new player. \n\nSome things you learn over time the more hours you put into the game. Try to just learn the basics and don\u2019t overload your brain with so much information from the get go. League is a game to be experienced not a game you learn in theory without application. \n\nAt the end of the day, playing should be fun for you. Take all of the variables aside like your teammates, the enemy team etc - are YOU having fun with the game?",

Anytime I saw something \"OP\" or \"Broken\" (usually it wasn't) I would immediately try to get that champ and try them for myself. I envy new players, they aren't hardened by years of playing and losses and they still get to experience the game through a new lens.\n\nLeague isn't a game you just hop on and learn in a week. Or a month. It's going to take a ton of time, and if that time ends up being 50% frustration and anger because of losing, then just don't play League. Or better yet, don't play competitive games, you're not cut out for it.",

But it took several months before she was able to understand the mechanics of the game and objectives etc. League is such an amazing game and I think you just need to keep playing and notice patterns that work. Mute everyone at the beginning for a while till you feel comfortable. Like others have said don\u2019t stress about it too much, just play the game. Maybe look at some champions that are on the easier side and decent.",

I started in 2018. the game was already 'hyper competitive' style attitude, this did not deter me BECAUSE I had played competitive games such as quake, CS, overwatch at a decent-high level. I understood the contract i signed coming in, its a hard game with a steep curve and players are literally 10 years ahead of me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nits getting to the point where i could see if you dont have the 'correct' mindset getting into league is a waste of time, the same way getting into a game like quake (other than stylistically a turn-off) the number one complaint you hear from new players is 'it feels like i cant do anything' so it is viewed as too hard/a waste of time. That may be a genuine concern for riot/the community to have to deal with\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there is absolutely a type of person who would still find the enjoyment in this game from day 1. you just have to 'want to get good at something'",

If you\u2019re actually new, not just a player on a new account, you just won\u2019t know enough about the game to even keep up in bronze/silver games.

He's an MMORPG reviewer and one of his main points for MMORPGs is that \"it gets better after 100 hours\" shouldn't be a good thing. I'd argue it's best to use this kind of mentality with any game. I started the game a decade ago but I know for a fact, especially after playing more games throughout the years, had I not gotten into LoL so early, I wouldn't have stuck with it otherwise. From person to person, please don't feel obligated to like something if you really can't find yourself actually liking it.\n\nI do wanna ask though. What about LoL makes you wanna like it? I'm assuming it's more to do with gameplay considering you come from Smite, right? If that's the case I'd probably say the best way to learn LoL is via someone who plays both games and can directly translate mechanics back and forth.",

Not to mention, the silver teammates you get initially will be pretty awful to you, since you\u2019ll end up griefing them, by accident, but they won\u2019t care. \n\nPlay normal drafts, mute your teammates, then mute their pings if needed. Try your best to learn &amp; avoid worrying too much about winning. Learn to play safe, especially if you die early. As a new player, it will be hard for you to carry games for your team, but you can basically solo lose them if you feed to hard. Watching videos will help you learn more advanced things, but when you actually play, try to focus on the basics. Wave management &amp; proper objective rotations won\u2019t matter if you go 0/5 in lane &amp; can\u2019t properly last hit minions. \n\nIt might seem daunting, and the new player experience is essentially as bad as it could be, but there is light at the end of the tunnel, if you really think you enjoy this type of game. I absolutely despised the new player experience when I started a few years ago, and there\u2019s times the game frustrates me still, but I\u2019m personally glad that I stuck with it enough to become relatively sufficient.

If you play well, not just on score but things like CSing and APM, after just a couple of games you're flagged as a smurf and exclusively play vs other players flagged as smurfs.\n\nWhen you already have a lot of MOBA experience, that's what happens. It sucks for people in your position, but the detection needs to be really aggressive. There are A LOT of garbage and extremely toxic players smurfing because ther main account got banned.\n\nThis way the new players with little to no experience in MOBAs (the majority) are somewhat shielded from that. You get screwed for it though.\n\nMaybe try making a new account and playing like shit for a few games. I've no idea how good you are, but if you weren't super good at DOTA or Smite then maybe the system won't flag you as a smurf later on.",

So instead of getting huffy that your level 14 account isn't winning or stomping every game, learn something from every game instead, wins mean nothing compared to growing yourself as a player.",

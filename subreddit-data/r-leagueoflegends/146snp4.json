Learn WHEN to roam tho, communicate that you are roaming etc. \n\nI think in reality when there is a diamond+ smurf in your game in mid  gold elo and you lose because of it there isnt much you could have done, so realize that and dont let your mental get broken by it. If you did your best, awesome!   \n\n\nFocus on self improvement, your own gameplay, what YOU could have done better, and ignore the losses that you feel were out of your control, noone playing league of legends wins every game, no matter how good they are.",

If you can't help it, take longer pauses in between games and watch the replay of ur game to see where it went wrong for YOU and focus on what YOU could improve, ignore what your team mates did because you can't change that. Yes you might have still lost, but you learn from losses far more than you do from victories because in losses your mistakes are punished while in victories they are almost invisible.",

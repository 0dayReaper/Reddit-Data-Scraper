When I see my team has 3 auto filled players and the other team has everyone on roll. Then my duo I get who\u2019s lost 6 in a row compared to their duo who\u2019s won the last 4. No way that game is 50/50 per day. It\u2019s more like 55% to lose 45% to win. Then you have to factor in draft and what not but still. How hard is it for riot to make sure everyone\u2019s on roll and everyone on both teams are in a similar state from their games. If I lost 5 games in a row I should be playing against other people who have also lost 5 in a row or are on losing streaks. Same goes if I\u2019m winning a lot. Why do you think \u201cauto fill\u201d is a thing. Do you not realize how many people play this game at any given moment in any rank? Matchmaking would be better off if there\u2019s no MMR no nothing. Just give me 4 random people on my team 4 random on the other team. Then, I should get the option to avoid shit players I get who are either toxic or straight up inting (i don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a bad game). I don\u2019t care if it takes me 8 minutes to get into a game. If those 8 minutes actually give me a fair 50/50 matchup based on all the shit they know about who\u2019s about to be in the lobby id rather have that then an insta queue because someone dodged and I\u2019m filling in that spot.",

    "postText": "https://streamable.com/h9ifi \n\nThroughout the entire game he goes on about how bad his teammates are and that the way they play should be bannable. All while being 2/8 before ending 2/11.\n\nAfter this he bans 20+ people from his chat after he went over the vod and asked twitch chat who's fault that game was and they responded 'you'.\n\nHow is this guy not indefinitely banned? All of this happened while streaming to his young, impressionable fan base.\n\nEdit: For the people asking for [a clip of him afking](https://streamable.com/wmowb) . Sat in base while his team wanted to keep playing. Unfortunately I can't get a clip from the stream because vods are sub only. Would like to add that he had said earlier in the stream that he would have afked earlier if he wasn't streaming.",

They have a massive, impressionable audience and their actions (and consequences, or lack thereof) absolutely affect both player norms and the public perception of the game. When they act toxic all the time and nothing bad happens to them, that demonstrates to thousands of viewers and even some people possibly being exposed to the game for the first time that this kind of behavior is acceptable. They *should* be held to a higher standard for this reason.\n\nTake this post as an example - #1 on /r/all and exposed to both everyone on this subreddit and the millions of reddit users at large. What kind of picture does this paint of League's community? Hell even /u/The_Cactopus was posting here a little while ago so we know Riot must be aware of the exposure. And yet, it is almost a certainty that nothing will be done. This will be swept under the rug and forgotten about within a few days, and the cycle of toxicity in this community will continue. In front of millions of people, there will be no consequence, and it will be used to justify future behavior.\n\nIt really is disappointing.",

Qiyana's more satisfying to play though imo, and she's an ok jungle champ which means you're not as screwed if you get auto-filled.",

Kata has no such utility but therefore is better at dishing out damage. Yet again you are an assassin, kill the enemy carry and you are good to go. Also the Qiqi Community here on Reddit is very wholesome.",

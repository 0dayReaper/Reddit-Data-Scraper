    "postText": "It still baffles me that despite league having over 160 champions that riot hasn't added a yearly champ rotation like every mainstream card game does. You're meaning to tell me that a new player not only has to learn almost 200 items but 160 champions and their respective ability and active mechanics aswell? Eg how many of you truly understand how zhonyas works? They do this for the items but apparently it's \"good game design\" to have to learn and read a fucking English essay every time you want to try a new champ. Pro play is shit and solo queue is terrible because of all these awful unnecessary factors.\nJust have a wild cespool mode where every champ and old item is available and the competitive standard draft mode for a way more balanced experience. Would fix every problem with this \"game\".",

Btw imo overloaded kits (like samira passive having 3 or 4 different passives) is a lot problematic then \"weird\" stuff like akshan W or kindred R where you understand after facing the said champ once. Riot also did a kinda good champ simplifying item choice and rune with all the predone stuff and when it comes to champions most people are OTPs and imo its part of the game to play against certain champ and learn or look up for what they do",

Power Creep is becoming more and more problematic because of these old systems negatively synergising with newer ones. Ashe E is a disgusting example of this; Information is everything in this game now and a global line of warding just is not fair. It is only poorly balanced because riot does not want to take the risks that would actually improve the state of the game.",

And it isn't necessary to do what mainstream games do either.\n\n&gt;how many of you truly understand how zhonyas works\n\nWhat's hard about Zhonya, like for real? Probably effective usage but it comes with experience \n\n&gt;read a fucking English essay\n\nI'm sorry if your comprehension skills are that poor \ud83d\ude2d League ability descriptions can have weird wording sometimes (Belveth \"stacks infinitely\" on ult for example) but it isn't related to the length of the text\n\n&gt;all these awful unnecessary factors\n\nWhat factors? That the game *wooow* is more complex than more popular games? Many players enjoy it for what it *is* and wouldn't want it any less skill expressive.\n\n&gt;have a wild cespool mode where every champ and old item is available\n\nWhat is \"old item\" supposed to mean?\nThere are in fact three \"cesspool\" gamemodes: bots, blindpick and normal.\nIt's a bit different story with every champ thing, because most likely Riot wants that new players yield to playing easier champs, which cost less by the way.\n\n\n&gt;Would fix every problem with this \"game\"\n\nI'm afraid it won't fix every problem... Not even a small part. And why is game quoted lmao??",

A card game has rotation because of the bountiful amount of required interactions and choices to understand. You're telling me 163 champions isn't reaching that level?\n2. Zhonyas, a singular item has more interactions in this game than Annie, Nasus and Malphite combined. It is a very good example of the required complexity League needs (which is why it is the 2nd best item in the game) but proves my point that this game is in needence of a more restricted Champion pool in modern gameplay\n3. Akshan\n4. 12% missing health item passive + lethal tempo and (insert champ here)\n5. Banner of command? Zz'rot? Hextech Gunblade? C'mon bro let's go to the DVD store and rent the new Adam Sandler movie\n6. League is man's best Learning tool. It is not a fun video game",

Having 2 backups in your main lane helps and having 1-2 you can kinda play in your offroles is good.\n\nSo if you know 7 champs, you're good.  \n\nAs for items, make 1 item page for each of your seven champs and use something like lolalytics, or [op.gg](https://op.gg) or whatever to figure out what to build and fling them on the item list for that champ.  Don't have to learn 200 items.  Most are part of the build path or not relevant for your champ.  \n\nYou really don't need to know every champ and matchup until diamond.  Before diamond, just learn to read the minions and position accordingly.",

BDS Adam (Darius Onetrick), G2 Hans Sama (Draven Onetrick), and others like FNC Trymbi who played support only because of Thresh's release. People love their champions and they would rebel if they were taken away from them. On a side note, rotations are god awful, and are the reason I'll never play a card game except Yu-Gi-Oh. I still have my Agent of Creation - Venus from third grade, and even used her when Agents were a rogue deck last year",

It could be as basic as settings, something more advanced, or even role specific tips!",

I remember playing my first placements the moment I finished leveling up my account just to see what my skill level was, but there where just a couple of days before end of season. I ranked ~14 games (counting placements lol) and \"ended\" that season in bronce 1 and from there on I've always end up placed in bronce 3 or 4 lol It got me very demotivated and after that I've never actually played that much ranked games.",

So since Nunu needs to Q, like Cho needs to R they can be CC\u2019d pretty easily to stop them - which then just makes it a smite-off with the 2 junglers. If Cho\u2019s ult were on lower CD he\u2019d probably be better than Nunu since he has harder CC to protect himself and give best opportunity (knock up/silence vs root/shorter knock up). Nunu is still great, and great at securing objectives, just giving the other side.",

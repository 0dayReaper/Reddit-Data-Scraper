    "postText": "Having been playing the game since Season 3, and with 163 champions currently in the game, there have been numerous times my friends or I have misheard some champion quotes. Most of the time, we've laughed, corrected each other, and moved on. Other times, those misheard quotes became inside jokes between us.  \n\n\nI started playing about the time that the Get Jinxed music video released with Jinx being the newest champion added to the game. She immediately became my favorite champion and I've mained her ever since. She has one quote when walking where she says, \"Ask me if I'm listening... Hint: I'm not!\" For the longest time I always thought she said \"lesbian\" and not \"listening.\" This is even funnier to me now considering all of the Arcane memes.   \n\n\nThere's also one where Lissandra says \"Plans within plans\" that I've always misheard as \"Plants with implants\" as though she were calling Zyra fake or something. My absolute favorite misheard quote, however, was when one of my friends was playing Gragas. Gragas has a quote that goes \"Don't get pushy!\", to which my friend immediately misheard and exclaimed, \"DOWN GET P\\*\\*\\*Y?!\"",

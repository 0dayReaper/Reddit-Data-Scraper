I couldn't find any when searching so just wondering if it was safe, thanks!\n\nUPDATE: Asking about frames and not the actual plate number on the car. I did send a support ticket asking this question but opinions are welcome!",

At least that\u2019s the policy for most companies cause it\u2019s simply not worth the legal hassle to sue you for it when all they can get is you taking the frame off. Their legal team drafting the paperwork costs infinitely more in billable hours than the value of the frame. So unless you did something entirely unrelated that personally pissed off someone at the top that they\u2019re willing to do it simply to spite you, you\u2019re safe.",

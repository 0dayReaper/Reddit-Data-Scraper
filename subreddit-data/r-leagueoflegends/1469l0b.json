    "postText": "Yes, winnig is all that matter when we are talking about the elo, and it is result of overall team play performance and should not be tied to KDA or cs. But when we talk about individual performance there is a difference, that's all about how you played. So why a S on a loss gets less champion mastery point than an C on win? that makes no sense. You can go 16/2/10 on a lose and gain +193 MP, or go 0/12/2 on a loss and get +500. \n\nWhat's the motivation on mastering a new champion if the individual performance does not matter?",

Win or losing has more variables than individual performance, but mastery should only be about how you permformed. \n\nI'm not even gonna comment about how someone with a good kda does more to the result of the game than someone with a terrible one.",

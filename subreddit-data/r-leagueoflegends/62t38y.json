Then as you level, you get talents to enhance these abilities. Ultimate abilities still come at level 10, but heroes can pick between two different ultimates. At level 20, you can enhance your ultimate.",

This game is harsh for beginners who are trying to get into it. Even if you are a better carry than the enemy's carry, you will still lose if he has better runes than you. This game encourages you to \"main\" only a few champions and therefore it can be harder to get into due to how boring and repetitive it can get.\n\nDotA's basics are not simple. It takes years to learn the game and lots of dedication to ever be good at it but it's so much easier to get into. Unlike LoL, DotA comes with every character unlocked from the very start. It encourages you to learn every hero rather than \"maining\" a specific one. No tedious grind is required, just a very steep learning curve. Dota is that game where anything goes. Even the most absurd builds will win you the game if you're good enough. You can switch your hero's role at any time. You probably won't get bored of playing it nonstop for 24 hours, but you will lose your sanity when you realize how cancerous this game is due to its heavily competitive nature.",

What the guy above is exactly how I feel and pretty much how all dota players feel. I don't get into the whole rivalry very much and I think this whole front page thing back and forth is dumb, but I will say this. Dota has so many more mechanics and little intricacies to the gameplay. Even putting all of the paid stuff in league aside, I think dota is a much more entertaining game because the skill cap and flexible heroes allow for much more unique and original gameplay than league. For example I know in league a lot of champions have to be played an exact certain way or you'll get flamed whereas in dota most heroes can play multiple positions on the map and this along with more interesting and unique item abilities allows for much more interesting gameplay imo. And all of this also allows for a MUCH more interesting pro scene imo. If you want to try dota out just message me and I'd love to teach you the basics.",

It's classed as a MOBA on steam, most people know it as a MOBA and the genre generally has been known as MOBAs since LoL's release. The genre used to be called Dota though and some people still prefer that name (or action RTS). In part, this is due to Riot Games pioneering the term MOBA (becoming synonymous with LoL) and commercializing the genre, something that Dota never represented to the same extent. Many people are also opposed to Riot's game design philosophies, which differ from that of the mod and Icefrog. ",

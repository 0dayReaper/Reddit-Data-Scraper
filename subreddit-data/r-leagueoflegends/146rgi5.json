If I'm at the peak of my ability and I want a competitive fun game, I want the other players im playing with and against to be at the same level as me.  Where I am on the ranked ladder doesn't matter. \n\nSo if you play a game where somebody unbalances the match by playing something they know nothing about, I can see why it is frustrating.",

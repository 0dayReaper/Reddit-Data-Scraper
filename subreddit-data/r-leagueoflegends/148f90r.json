            "comment": "There's too much to go over, really. You're honestly better off just treating the game as if yourve never played before and are learning for the first time. Most of the items and objectives you're familiar with are different now. Even many of the champions you knew are now different, having been reworked or adapted to fit modern league. If you want to have fun don't overthink it and try to absorb raw information, just play the game and have a good time! You'll pick up on what's changed over time",

            "comment": "Everything changed a bit but the core of the game is the same.\n\nThings of note are new champions, but that youre going to learn as you play - just keep in mind that new champions are usually better than old champions, more mobile with more complex kits. Id watch a few videos on each of them to see if any interest you.\n\nThe rune system changed, but it is also automatic if you dont want to bother with it yet, theres a button next to the rune list in champion select that allows you to pick a set out of 3.\n\nThere is still dragon and baron, but they also added the herald. It is like a big crab that spawns up to two times before the baron. If teams kill it they can spawn it and it is basically a siege monster, pretty useful.\n\nDragons now are of different elements, you can look that up, the first 3 are all different types, when the third is killed all next dragons will be of that type, and will change the map accordingly - also look that up. If one team kills 5 dragons, the next is an elder dragon, harder to kill and gives a buff that instantly kills enemies that are below a threshold of hp. Baron buff now buffs minions making them better at sieging.\n\nThe jungle monsters changed but its mostly the same thing. There are some plants in the jungle now that heal you, give vision, or allow you to jump walls\n\nNow you have trinkets, everyone gets it, there are several types but basically allows you to ward at no cost. Pink wards can only be obtained in the shop though\n\nThe items changed a lot, now there is a new item class called mythic. You can only have one mythic and its stats increase based on subsequent items. You can just buy what is recommended on the shop it wont make much of a difference in the beginning while you relearn the game.\n\nYou probably know that but now we have a pretty strict meta now of solo top, solo mid, jungler, adc and sup in bot, so try to play around that\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats the summary of the changes, but Id suggest you to just pick whatever you like and play in normals, you will get used to things in just a few games",

            "comment": "1) The game uses these new rune pages instead of the old mmorpg style tree. You can pick 4 from the first page and 2 from a second page.\n\n2) Try to go non-aggressive support, you can still react to things but slowly learn as you play and see different champions. Nami is a great example because you can blind pick her into many team compositions (ally and enemy).",

            "comment": "Hey, it should me easier to learn the game now, as even though there are many new things, pretty much everything has recommendation: runes, items, and so on.\n\nWhat you remember are masteries, they are gone, or should I say they merged old runes and masteries into new runes. If you want more help, you can read some guides on sites like League of Graphs to see how others are playing your champion.\n\nThere are some changes on the map with dragons and plants, but you should feel ok after 10 or so games, and up to date in 50.",

That proves how big and grown-up anime is. But anime has so much more than that to offer. Comedy animes are a gold mine. So are slice of life shows, although they're not for everyone.\n\nI really like a lot of the fantasy adventure animes with a lighter tone, like Konosuba and No Game No Life. A lot of animes \"get\" fantasy and gaming settings more than traditional media. They cater to people who live their lives in videogames and DnD sessions and they don't spend the whole time introducing boomers to the world of the internet. They get right into it.\n\nBased on what you said above and nothing else, I'd recommend Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Watch it dubbed if you want, it's a good dub. It's an adult show, cyberpunk setting, but it really slows the pace down and gives you time with the atmosphere. It's less about getting from A to Z and more about everything you see and hear along the way. If you watch it, compare it to the recent Hollywood remake and you'll get a feel for why some of us really click with anime.",

Some of them are directly connected to the OG like being it prequel while others are set up as different 'timelines'.\n\n\nThe common factor in them all are 'servants'  a powerful familliar summoned from human history(something ancient like hercules or even new like tesla himself, as long as they are remarkable and left a mark in human history)\nThey usually fight in a battle royale (the classic is 7 servants) with their masters(the summoner) for an ultimate wish granter called the holy grail. Not all servants are created equal, some are stronger than the other but the most important is the chemistry between the Master and Servant because the servant can just literally kill their master if they dislike them.\n\nThen there are also series that a part of the franchise but do not have servants in them like Garden of Sinners. This usually explore the magic system and some other stuffs.",

Just change Rabadon's Deathcap to \"two needlessly large rods\" or \"dual wielded NLRs\".\n\nIt only works if they kinda make sense to be stronger when put together.

You can't take Blood Thirster's components and be like \"it's a big sword duct taped to a scepter with a cloak wrapped around them\".",

And despite only getting 70% back, selling those items actually gives you almost exactly enough for this item. So when you're about to be full build, you can just sell everything and buy this and your raw stats will go up, not down. Then you can continue getting stronger into the super late game (or even mid-late game if you're hard snowballing).",

If you want to know what an actually good client looks like, [take a look at this](https://clips.twitch.tv/OriginalFlirtyBaboonFeelsBadMan).\n\nThe Dota 2 player wants to know if an ability of his champion can remove the cc of another champion (which is like their version of Skarner).  So, in the middle of his ranked game, he creates a test game, spawns the enemy hero, and has them cast their cc on him, to test the interaction.\n\nThe whole process takes him less than 30 seconds.",

There's nothing wrong here from a usability perspective.\n\nFrom lobby, the queue pops and the bottleneck is the timer to accept. Their use of animation to indicate the real time status of this timer is great. Usability is fine here. \n\nFrom picks and bans, the UI conveys what's going on and who's taking action next. It looks like they add plenty of redundancy with the animated circle + arrow, usage of colors and the caption on the top of the UI. The added delay between banning and picking is necessary considering you have a range of players who are new to the game to those with thousands of games - you can't design for one group in this case. Usability is more than fine here. \n\nUsability: \"the degree to which something is able or fit to be used.\"",

It was too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch is the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. \n\n\nChristie, take off the robe.\n\n\nListen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. \n\n\nSabrina, remove your dress. \n\n\nln terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. \n\n\nSabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. \n\n\nTake the lyrics to \"Land of Confusion.\" In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. \"In Too Deep\" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as, uh, anything I've heard in rock. \n\n\nChristie, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. \n\n\nPhil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial, and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially songs like \"In the Air Tonight\" and \"Against All Odds.\" \n\n\nSabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. \n\n\nI also think that Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group than as a solo artist. And I stress the word \"artist.\" This is \"Sussudio.\" A great, great song. A personal favorite. \n\n\nLook at the camera. Christie, look at the camera.",

There\u2019s actual Knock-Up\u2019s like Yasuo Q; and there\u2019s Knock-Back like Maokai Q; Knock-Aside like Taliyah R; and Pull like Blitz Q.\n\nThe golden rule has basically become \u201cif it moves your champion even if it\u2019s just a visual move, it\u2019s essentially a knock-up\u201d; but way more champions have access this kind of CC now and some champions heavily rely on the full CC duration applying.\n\nYou can say that Tenacity should apply on all CC; but then what about Blitz? Do you just get to go free 3/4ths of the hook distance? But the converse is true; it should be fair game to build treads in Malz/WW, because if that much of their kit power is locked up in Suppress duration; they\u2019re not an actual champion just an ult bot.\n\nI think Riot needs to stop treating these 4 kinds of CC like they\u2019re the same.",

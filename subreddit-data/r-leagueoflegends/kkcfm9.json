He sleeps poorly/barely, he gains weight, he\u2019s depressed, he\u2019s forgetful, he nods off during the day a lot, and last February he had to get a double bypass and a valve replacement. Doctor told him he needs to use his mask because the apnea is so hard on his heart. He still doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s like one thing he can do to not kill himself, but he won\u2019t do it. \n\nNot completely relevant but I guess I just needed to vent. Sleep apnea left unmanaged fucking sucks.",

They are often covered by health insurance (atleast in germany)\n\nI hope that your father will someday realize how easy to \"fix\" his problem is and even a 7 year old that now uses the mask for close to 20 years had no problems adapting to using it nightly.",

My girlfriend tells me I stop breathing in the middle of the night all the time, and other related sleep apnea issues. Have tried to get it diagnosed this year but the sleep clinic is closed here due to covid. Just wondering if you\u2019re saying you can actually die from it?\n\nEdit: I appreciate the advice \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019ll get it checked out ASAP.",

I went years with mild symptoms (didn't recognize them at the time) and then it accelerated *hard* one winter to the point where i was waking up 2-4x nightly with hallucinations, couldn't stay awake/focus without caffeine because of sleep deprivation, got dizzy when standing up from a chair, got cold hands/feet when I never had before, and even had heart palpitations. \n\nThen I finally got a sleep study, got diagnosed with OSA, and then within a few months of CPAP therapy my life had turned around completely. \n\nFor other people, their symptoms might remain difficult to notice (many people don't wake from their apneas). Their treatment might not be noticeable for months, or it could change their life in a couple weeks.\n\nCauses are also different for everyone. Mine unfortunately does not seem weight-related, because I'm at a healthy weight now (dropped 70 pounds) and I *still* have it :/",

You don't get runes immediately; for the first few levels there are preset pages that you don't get to choose paired with each champion. Eventually they give you control over that.\n\nBasically, now you can change your runes in champ select, and runes are more flashy and unique than scaling or flat armor or mr or ap or ad or cdr. You get a keystone rune that you're meant to base your build off of, 3 rune choices in the same \"tree,\" and then can choose a secondary \"tree\" to get 2 runes off of. Finally, you get some choices for armor vs mr vs hp, and ad/ap vs attack speed vs cdr, that sort of thing.\n\nSorry if that's hard to follow. tl;dr yes runes are free now, and everyone can choose them in champ select.\n\n[Here's](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Rune) the wiki page if you want to do some more reading. Personally I'm a fan of the change, as less ip grinding is always a plus in my book.",

No, New GP actually needs you to pay attention to waves and brushes, the fact that everyone can have an Oracles and OP junglers like Kayn have not been deleted and bounties means I can never even push up anymore without paying 100% focus attention to the whole game, it's way less fun this way.\n\nSeason 3-5 you could bullahit and have fun with your Team, today the New dragons and bounties mean you have to stay on top of your game AND meticulously coordinate your team into not throwing every minute of the game or the 0-16 enemy kayn/yasuo will come back and 1v9 you for no reason\n\nJust let me have FUN in the jungle again Riotttttt pepeHands\n\nEDIT: Also lie to my face and tell me this ranked music was not 10x better than anything that ever came after it: https://youtu.be/WIOh512j8XM",

When league would go into maintenance or when servers were down or if the thing was just bring buggy the play button would be greyed out. you could type this thing and the client would force the play button to light up.

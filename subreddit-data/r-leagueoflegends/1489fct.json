These players also has weak mental and will throw games immediately because it doesn't even matter to them.\n\nI played 5 games yesterday and had a player like this in my team 4 times.",

Back when they first got rid of elo and bought in this stupid ladder system it used to be that when you hit the top level of a certain tier (i.e. gold 1, plat 1, dia 1) you'd start getting +1 or +2 for a win and lose like 14+ for a loss. I once spent nearly an entire year trying to get out of plat 1, got to 99LP and won a game and I swear to god got +0 LP. I took a long, long break after that. ETA: I was playing against people in like D3-D1 the entire time this was happening as well.",

The flip side is what we used to have where smurfs play like 50 games in silver-plat and stomp them all. Those players feel the exact same way. It's like \"why the fuck is this guy with a 90% wr over 40 games still playing in plat\". You can't ever have a system that puts people in their true mmr instantly.

My bot lane is a Bronze 1 support (8 wins - 8 losses) and my adc is in their first game of placements (this game ended a 9 game win streak, so my reward for winning 9 games in a row and being in silver 1 with 20 lp was to get placed against 3 people in gold and have 2 teammates who aren't even out of bronze??

Yes, visual rank doesn't matter, it's just about your MMR but how is my MMR the same as someone 900 lp below me :/? How are Bronze 3 adc's with a 14% win-rate ending up in a lobby with a gold 4 mid laner? If you're 800 games into a 6 month season and you're squarely at a 50% win-rate, I think maybe, just maybe you should get teammates who are Bronze 1, Silver 4, or Silver 3 (you know people who are actually at your rank) and instead this guy got a 1-7 bronze adc and also a random gold 4 mid laner. It doesn't seem like the issue is player skill, it seems like the MMR system is meaningless and is not creating good games.  \n\nIf this is supposed to be a ladder system, I should be playing with and against people who are the same rung as me OR on the rungs below and above me. And instead, it seems like 1/3 of the games are wildly inconsistent matchmaking and that whenever my visual rank starts to outpace where Riot MMR's system has decided I should be (like a 9 game winstreak) I don't end up in a lobby where I have tough opponents and a fair shot, I end up with back to back game where's my teammates are bronze 1 with a losing win rate and are duo'd with people who are just starting their placements and I'm against opponents who are all in and around my elo?? In what world is that balanced.",

If your mmr is higher than that threshold you get increased lp gains, and if it's lower you get decreased lp gains. LP gains are constantly trending towards the visible rank your mmr belongs in. The only difference between this system and the old system with visible elo is that it isn't so volatile. It's to stop somebody who is 1490 elo from jumping between gold and silver every time they win or lose a game, because that contributes to ranked anxiety. If you're a 1501 elo player you just won't queue up because you don't want to get an unlucky game and fall out of gold.",

They might be within a few points once it considers you to be stagnant and no longer improving but it will never settle to equal your visual rank. It doesn't float as far as, for instance, halo infinite mmr where it can be over an entire tier different and never catches up or down with your visual rank, but to be honest, if it's more than half a div, that's too much variance.",

Olaf has 200+ games played at 48% wr, Zac has ~250 with 53%, Lucian has ranks going back to Season 6 and stopped playing in S10, so it's understandable his level is low, similar thing for Ahri, she has a rank in S8.\n\nA lot of the other games are pretty similar. There's only like three accounts there over a 60% winrate that aren't a small sample size, and I don't think I saw a single one you mentioned being under 40% like you claimed. This kind of just reinforces what I think about people complaining about smurfs - you do actually run into one every now and then, but you're so obsessed with finding them that you think there are far more than there are.",

First game had lvl 33 Annie, second game had lvl 33 Vlad, and  fourth game had lvl 34 twitch. Second game MAYBE had a second one with the lvl 43 Yone and the third game MAYBE had one as well with the lvl 41 MF. The 5th game is the only one obviously without a smurf.  \n  \nDefinitely not to the point where they outnumber the normal player as OC put it but it\u2019s definitely common enough where one will exist in a majority of your ranked games. You can check your own ranked match history as well, a majority of your games will have at least 1 smurf.",

At around 30 Lp S2 I suddenly for 3 games get lvl 32 Bronze IV players in the enemy team who are legendary by minute 15. And I get compensated with a lvl 70 Bronze 1 player who has 70 cs in minute 20 and plays varus top for the first time. Yeah. This is clearly a good ranking system. Especially when I win 1 of those shitridden games, I gain 18 Lp for carrying that game. If as expected by this godforsaken ranking system to \"test me\" i loose 28 out of sheer spite. Back to 0 LP and My MMR goes even lower. I get even more of those Pest infested weird games where peoples MMR is already in S2 but they are in Bronze( and even Iron) and the other way around. The Cycle continues.\n\nIt's not fun, it's not competitive, it frustrates. It makes everyone tilt easier. It doesn't represent any kind transparent or well presented skill level. It causes anxiety, it gets people in the cycle of \"the next one will be better\" addiction even harder. It's not an occasional random thing, it's a systematic part of the game.  Why is this not forbidden by law again?\n\nThis is NOT a FIX.",

Agree we can improve here.  \n\n\nMMR disconnects &amp; Smurfing are things we take pretty seriously and are constantly looking to improve, but are a challenging problem space.\n\nWhat OP *most likely* experienced were intense disconnects between MMR and display rank, which can happen with newer accounts who win often enough.\n\nWe used to matchmake on both display rank and MMR, but this led to pockets of disconnected (in the ranked terminology) players playing together, which ended up being called smurf queue. -- This also negatively impacted players moving through those pockets even if they themselves were not smurfs. Most often this happened when a player returned to League after an absence.  \n\n\nHere are some of the future plans we have for these systems:  \n\n\n* Looking into some holistic improvements to the MMR system itself that will help get folks into the correct position something like 25% faster\n* Longer-term investigating updates to the MMR system that will get people into the correct position 80%+ faster (this is further out)\n* Creating better systems for new players so they are not interacting with smurf accounts as often\n\nOur goal is that you have extreme fast, extremely accurate matchmaking in your games. Please keep letting us know when we are falling short of that.",

At the beginning of the season, my first 350 games were like 90% good quality, I couldnt believe how good the matchmaking was and I climbed from low plat to d2 and stayed there for 3 weeks. After that 350 game mark its like a switch was flipped and all of a sudden the matchmaking quality went completely out the window, some ques started taking 3-4mins and I started noticing significantly more toxic players and trolls in my games. I sunk back down to plat 4 over another few hundred games and averaged a consistent 40% w/r the entire way down no matter how good I would play, so many doomed games that I wasn't seeing the entire climb up. As a statistics enthusiast, I couldnt understand what was happening since this consistent good luck and consistent back luck ive had, that had been displayed over such a large sample size, didnt make any sense. Not a single win streak over 5 in 400 games seemed almost impossible considering I was trying my hardest, yet I still got plenty of loss streaks over 5",

In no fuckin universe should a Bronze and Gold be in the same game and no the Gold wasn't deranking or Duo with the Bronze.\n\nRiot support said that, even though there wasn't parity across roles, there was overall parity between the team total MMR and that just makes no sense to me.\n\nHow does a Bronze JG beat a Gold JG? And since we had a Bronze JG he never came Bot once. But, the enemy Bronze was a Support against me. We won lane but didn't smash with lots of plates or anything and never got any objectives in spite of having Prio because our Bronze JG never got Heralds or dragons.\n\nTo me, this is another major flaw of the system. Having a matchmaker that goes \"eh, both of these average MMR are equally weird so it must be a fair match\" makes no sense to me. It's like putting an NFL player on two peewee teams, where one team gets an NFL linebacker and the other team gets an NFL Quarterback. It's \"balanced\" but it's not in any way fair or equal.\n\nThe fact that you're not matched on YOUR OWN MMR but instead matched to an average MMR that the matchmaker thinks is equal, is total garbage. Each position should have MMR parity with each opposing position, not just average the 5 MMRs together and call it close enough.",

I have no issues with players climbing faster on a new acc to get them out of Low elo in case they really \"are a smurf\". But if the system says you get 10times the Elo of the average old/normal account, then there is a huge fcking issue on riots fantastic stupid and nonsensical idea. **If it takes my main account to gain 100Wins over loses to reach from unranked to diamond for example but a new account has just to win 10 wins over loses in his first 15 games played and then he is diamond MMR, well then i have a fcking problem with riot.**\n\n**IDK what riot is smoking but this system is clearly ruining High Elo and mid Elo gamequality because every second player is getting Elo inflated and goes far beyond the Elo he ever reached on his actual main account**.\n\nwhen i see a insane bad player, one that is so bad that i'm literally mindblown ingame by him, i tell myself nowadays as a meme, let me guess it's a low level fresh account isn't it? I check his profile, and 90% of the time it's legit a low level fresh account. Clearly showing these players get massively Elo inflated. it's just a joke there is no excuse anymore, there is nothing to say anymore. in this regard riot is really one of the worst company, because they kept this system in for 2+ years and since last year so many people call it out, of how hardcore this system potentially elo inflates players, and it's a joke that they aren't acting. I hope more people speak up on reddit often about this or riot will never change it. But as a master+ player myself on a REAL account. I can tell you, this is ruining Solo q, and Solo q will be ruined more and more if riot doesn't stop this madness\n\nThis system shouldn't even exist because it's unfair treatment, you can't just give a chess player for example massive Elo boost, because the chess players plays in his first season ever. everybody has to follow the same rules. you can't just say \"oh you started to play tournaments today in chess? well for every victory on ur side we give you ten times the Elo gain a player get's that played since years ago. It's just completely unfair, nonsenical and it ruins every single Ranked tier, not just Master or Diamond. Everything that is above the default MMR, which is most likely around silver 2-3 or maybe a bit lower, is being affected and ruined. Every single rank above Silver is actively getting hurted by this System existing. Gold plat diamond master, gm and even challenger potentially can actively get hurt by this nonsense.",

Quite the opposite, i would like ranked to be less grindy, make the smurfs go up the ranks faster to get where they are supposed to be so they don't play at low ranks",

Let\u2019s say as a jungler, it\u2019s not ideal having to teach people the basics of macro and micro play in a \u2018high elo\u2019 match. According to OP.gg they played better then me but that\u2019s because of the time length of the fame + the nature of the roles being more kill oriented then my Rell JG.",

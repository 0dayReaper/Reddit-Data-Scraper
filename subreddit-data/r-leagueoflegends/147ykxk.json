Additionally, it will deal way more damage than Q auto, since the Auto can't proc the Q.\n\nHow is waveclear more important in sidelanes?  \nAfter all, you want to create a slowpush for better sieging, so you can either take turret faster or go roam, while one of the enemies has to take the huge wave. For that Statics is not needed and can even be a hindrance, since the proc might even push the wave too fast.  \nAnd in case you really need to push that wave through, e.g. to join your team for a drake or Baron, W with R is good enough and by the time a fight breaks out, R is up again.",

So by the time you get your Statics, your laning phase is over and waveclear matters far less. Besides, you now can also clear a wave pretty easily with W +Ludens.  \nAnd let's not forget, you're forced to build completely usless components for the Statics that give you next to no power by themselves, which decreases your combat power significantly. And on LB the 1-2 item spike is probably her strongest in the game, so you want to then have as much power as possible and not sit on a crit cloak and farm so you'll eventually be able to waveclear.\n\nAnd if you buy it later, the waveclear gets even less important, while the extra AP and AH from Lich far outdo the stats that statics give, ontop of the lower CD.",

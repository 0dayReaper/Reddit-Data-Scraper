Sure, it may feel bad to have lost agency as Lucian when that's the premiere aspect of him, but data shows that current Lucian still is prefered than back when he was constantly getting hit with nerfs.\n\nNot sure if these count, but:\n\n- Diana has been definitely more popular. Be it jungle or mid, she just has a heavier pr imo\n\n- Kench may be dead in supp, but he already was dead there. his PR in top is small but relatively good and his wr seems healthier without being broken.\n\n- Irelia, while not classified as a midscope. turning her to use 4 marks instead of 5 and balancing her around this. Removed the need to control waves so hard and let her enter teamfights more reliably, which is pretty good for soloQ. Still can outplay people but now you can play without having to outplay + helped reduce the proplay pressence.",

Generally goes on for around 30 mins or more where we fiddle around with builds and stuff (seemingly more fun than normal league). Kinda crazy how everyones diving into the details of the fight cause we just slapping rocky foreheads at this point xD. However i did wanna go to the wolves cause we didnt want super minions getting in the way. We always let each other farm up and have a fair fight. Imma post the match history of this game here and the deets just so yall know its real.

Generally goes on for around 30 mins or more where we fiddle around with builds and stuff (seemingly more fun than normal league). Kinda crazy how everyones diving into the details of the fight cause we just slapping rocky foreheads at this point xD. However i did wanna go to the wolves cause we didnt want super minions getting in the way. We always let each other farm up and have a fair fight. Imma post the match history of this game here and the deets just so yall know its real.

    "postText": "Afternoon all,\n\nWith the upcoming changes to ranked seeming to be a step in the right direction (in my opinion anyway). It got me once again thinking about another issue that has been cropping up for years, and in my personal experience has become one of the main factors as to why I currently hate playing ranked.\n\nThe fact that solo/duo isn't just solo really irritates me, I'm in low Gold and the amount of purchased accounts that I see boosting a premade up is insane, this is on top of general smurfers playing on their own. The issue is, unlike smurfs having a fairly proportionate chance to being on my team, this doesn't seem true for duos, especially when I am in a duo of my own.\n\nI'm not entirely sure why solo isn't solo and flex is everything else, as far as I am aware, solo is, and always has been the \"proper\" rank if you will, so the fact this can be unfairly swung in one way or another because one of my team mates is matching with their new buddy who is playing his first ranked game or an enemy who is carrying his mate up to near his main account ranked is... odd? \n\nAs I mentioned, this works two ways - not only can duos be unfairly matched (or at least encourage it, I imagine some smurfs don't like playing low ranked games, but will do it to play with a friend). But it can also swing the other, creating imbalance because you can premake with people lower than you too. \n\nThis is also forgetting that again, in my thousands of hours on league, premades seem to be the most toxic group, they feel they can run the game no matter what, often looking out for each other before the team.\n\nI'm not sure what the difference is between 2, 3 and 5 man premades all being in the same pool and I can't find too much discussion on it that doesn't quickly result in a shouting match of \"You're just bad lmao\" (like most things League tbf)\n\nIf worst comes to worst, why not just introduce a third rank, solos, duos and flex?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: Ranked solo/duo should, in my opinion very obviously be just ranked solo.",

While you lose a wave, the enemy jungler gains a lot less XP from helping shove the wave while the enemy midlaner is losing just under half of the wave in XP.\n\nYou're going to lose something, that is just how the game works. Stop playing emotionally and assess the situation objectively. As I said, adapt to the fact if the jungle is duo with your lane opponent you are the victim of cyber bullying for the duration of lane phase. It is annoying, but also happens when junglers aren't duoq. They just don't focus on one lane as much.\n\nPlaying emotionally is never the answer. Getting 'mad' about having to sack a wave due to jungle pressure is legit just and mental, and isn't something that's exclusive to duoq junglers.  Happens plenty of times with solo junglers. Spoiler alert, it still happens in master (where I play) despite there being no duoq.",

They boost it using duo, as it's much faster and easier to do (guess why 2 premades mid+jng vs 8 is easier than solo vs 9).\n\nYou may call it different, in the end result is the same. Lower elo will face them and they don't give a shet, or this duo does it for money or not. They gonna play against them anyway.",

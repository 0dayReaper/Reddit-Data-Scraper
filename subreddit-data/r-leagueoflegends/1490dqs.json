    "postText": "A permanent ban is completely pointless unless it's an IP ban. The player will simply get another account (if they don't already have one). They can just make a new email and level a new account themselves, or they can spend all of the $12 it takes to buy a fully leveled account with like 200k blue essence on it from any number of third party providers. If Riot's goal is to legitimately ban players permanently, it has to be an IP ban otherwise it does nothing. The majority of the trolls getting these perma-bans are intentionally trolling only on their alt accounts because they know how Riot operates and are abusing the system. \n\nWhile it is possible to get a new IP address, it is significantly more difficult than getting a new account. I can't stress this enough: please do not underestimate how much this change would benefit the overall community.",

    "postText": "Do you guys think the 13.12 nerfs will be enough to finally put these two to rest? Or will they continue to be 100% presence pick/bans for the rest of the season?\n\nIt's crazy to consider the state these two released in, how MANY rounds of nerfs they've gone through and they STILL see play at the pro-level. Turns out trying to balance a hyper-mobile ADC that deals amazing damage along with an incoporeal/immortal support that can run an extra combat summoner for free and act as an extra legendary item stat stick for said ADC - all while being beginner friendly to execute on - is a POTENT combination even at the pro level.....BUT WHO COULD HAVE POSSIBLY FORESEEN THAT EVENTUALITY!?\n\nIf I wasn't so jaded by them I'd laugh.",

Gutting her current build entirely will require pros to pivot, and that usually takes a bit of time.\n\nYuumi also takes a few hits in both 13.11 and 13.12, between her direct changes and the various nerfs to Enchanter items. Could very well be enough to drastically lower her priority, especially if more engage supports see play.",

I have a hard time believing a new build will be any close to the old one and she also has all of her synergies with enchanters nerfed as well as nerfs to those enchanters.\n\nFor Yuumi it depends. The triforce of enchanters have been nerfed as a whole so if they all stays meta then no it won't change.",

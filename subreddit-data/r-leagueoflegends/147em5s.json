            "comment": "All you really have to do to climb is to do your job better than the enemy support. Getting out of bronze is most definitely not a champion issue, especially since you play Milio who is one of the strongest supports in the current patch. Rather you likely do not understand what agency you have as a support.\n\nI think the best thing you could do is to research about your role and to try to apply those concepts to your gameplay. I personally highly recommend [this fundamentals playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbaTayc6KBJjEEFEAN6garVbadjDpeHsX) by Coach Cupcake. Record VODs of your gameplay, reflect on your mistakes, set small and specific learning goals, and you will eventually climb.",

If you're an offensive player, try being patient and exploiting the other team's mistakes. As a support player, you want to be using your time to make the biggest impact on the map possible, so it's important to think about what will get your team the farthest ahead. Is it babying your Adc? Is it mirroring your jungle to set up ganks/contest objectives. Is there anything you could be doing, that you're not doing to disrupt what the enemy team wants to do? Re-evaluate your strategies from the assumption that whatever you're currently doing is wrong.",

His healing was off the charts so any damage would just come straight back unless we caught him 5v1.\n\nMatch op.gg: [https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/Jestaah/matches/ewOhykeZdeeFY-n8Qie9J6GFtKq-N5QNvcE0vfO9JtE%3D/1686746645000](https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/Jestaah/matches/ewOhykeZdeeFY-n8Qie9J6GFtKq-N5QNvcE0vfO9JtE%3D/1686746645000)\n\nHe was fed very early in the game so was always ahead.

When I play Senna, I almost always buy executioner's calling after finishing my mythic. So my build path would be Umbral&gt;Eclipse&gt;Executioner's Calling&gt;RFC&gt;Mortal reminder\n\nEdit: also just noticed that you took heal when your MF already had it. Senna usually takes exhaust, which whould have also helped tremendously against Aatrox. That or ignite for the anti heal. Double heal lanes barely sound good on the surface, but if you both used it in too short of a time the second one would be wasted",

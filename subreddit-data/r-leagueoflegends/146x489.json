Companies prey on people like you releasing stuff with a cost, whether it's money or time.\n\nThere's a difference between entitlement and companies forcing you to play every day or otherwise miss out on things vs them releasing an achievement based thing that doesn't expire. One is predatory and the other isn't. There's plenty of other ways to release skins, emotes, etc. without them forcing you to play with a certain timeframe.\n\nIt's like when they release halloween skins that come back, that's perfectly fine because you can get them the next year or maybe every other year they come back, but when they release a skin with the intent of you never being able to obtain it again you're at a standstill. Do you spend $20-30 on a skin for your champion or never have the opportunity to get it again?\n\nYou saying that people are entitled makes you apart of the problem with company greed and you're feeding it. Lets make things for players, not for company greed. Fomo isn't for players.",

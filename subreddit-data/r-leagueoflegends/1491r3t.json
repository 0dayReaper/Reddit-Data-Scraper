Whether that means letting them walk forward to do some damage and lantern ins then back or just playing in a good range to peel for targets. Or sometimes you just need to step forward and try and catch people out etc. that\u2019s the beauty of Thresh. He\u2019s so versatile with his kit.",

Sona is my #1 choice cus if you misstep at all you're basically insta dead. Zilean and sera would also probably be top picks too... And probably Milo, soraka, and Renata. Karma for honorable mention. Depends on her build and match up.",

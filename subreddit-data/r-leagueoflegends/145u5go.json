    "postText": "TL;DR \n\nThis is a survey specific to League of Legends and will use the responses to be put into an index in order to see how certain ranks contain particular attributes in relation to other ranks, other games, or even sports.  \n\n[https://forms.gle/MsS4V5MC2NjqfvVG9](https://forms.gle/MsS4V5MC2NjqfvVG9)\n\nThis survey will not capture any of your information, emails, personal data. The full details are in the heading of the survey. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDear Competitive Gamers,\n\nMy name is Jeremiah Gann, I am an assistant researcher with the Human\n\nPerformance Lab at Idaho State University. At this time, we are conducting an\n\nimportant study to better understand how competitive video game players\n\ncope with the various adversarial aspects of this unique and stressful gaming\n\nenvironment.\n\nIf you are **at least 18 years of age** and choose to participate, you will be asked\n\nto complete a 5\u201310 minute online survey. The survey itself was designed by\n\nresearchers in Human Performance and Psychology and has been used for\n\nmore than 25 years to examine the coping skills of various athletic and\n\noccupational groups.\n\nThe results of the survey will be kept completely confidential and neither your\n\nname nor any other descriptor will be associated with the publication or\n\npresentation of the results. If you have any questions about the study, feel free\n\nto contact me or the Lab Director, Michael C. Meyers, PhD, FACSM using the\n\ninformation below.\n\nTo take the survey please use the following link:\n\n[https://forms.gle/MsS4V5MC2NjqfvVG9](https://forms.gle/MsS4V5MC2NjqfvVG9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAttached here is the official recruitment letter:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dhoka0s2c55b1.jpg?width=2550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7719cec298868781c72a1179e75bdfee14d08fc1\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

That is a big wave, and Ezreal is about to lose a HUGE amount of gold + xp by missing out on it. \n\nVi is pushing it fast so that some of them die before he can get back to lane.\n\nThe other reason is your wave will hit the tower, then start pushing back to you. You can allow that to happen then freeze it closer to your own tower. \n\nVi isn't stealing it to be annoying. She also needs gold / xp to make up for ganking the lane too, or she will fall behind to the other jungler clearing.",

And even then despite all that, she couldve frozen the wave in a much better way without taking my gold.",

He's already at his T2 before you've even got out of base lol.\n\nWhy should the jungler not fix your wave and take some gold / xp at the same time?. Jungling is about tempo, being ahead in levels is a big advantage when fighting over neutral objectives.\n\nYou are thinking purely selfishly. You asked why she took your wave but don't like the reasons why. \n\nIt WAS the correct play.",

            "comment": "1. The first scenario is an immediate slow push towards your side. Thinning the wave sets up a slow push back while denying your minions from enemy if that is the intention. On this 4:14 wave then, you could freeze afterwards or let it shove into tower. \\~50-80 gold and exp is lost from enemy minions dying while it pushes. Vi gets less gold and you get the majority of the gold from the 2 waves (3:14 and 4:14 waves). But this would also require the thresh to know how to lane and properly hold this 5:14 wave.\n2. Clearing this wave freezes the lane past midpoint towards enemy tower because it would crash at 5:14 and there is 6 alive left at the end to stall at enemy tower. There is going to be a pushback to your tower on the 6:14 wave if you only last hit. The rest of the scenario is the same as 1. Vi gets all the gold from the 2 waves.\n\nHowever, you could also fast shove the 6:14 wave again since you are hitting it first. This opens up harass under tower/platings if you are playing aggro, or dodging jg/warding/recalling again. Though, it is not easy to harass or get plates since it is only a 1 wave crash. But, the scenario again turns into 1.\n\nIn the end, the difference becomes who pockets more gold, and what the lane state is between 5:14 and the next few minutes.\n\nBecause Ez is solo laning when you return on the 5:14 wave, there is a window where you could freely poke Ez under tower on this 5:14 wave to get an hp advantage by choosing scenario 2. You could maybe convert this advantage to a kill on the 6:14 pushback if Ez played terrible. If you knew the jg started top, then they would not be bot side to punish you poking under their tower because of their top side timer.\n\nBut a pressure advantage can also be achieved in scenario 1, where thresh holds the freeze, and you both zone him off your 6:14 wave since heimer is not in lane yet. However, you would not get an hp advantage since ez is not pressured by tower damage to farm minions and can q as he pleases without taking hp. If you did not track jg, this would also be the safer play. Losing the \\~50+ gold and exp here is the downside.\n\nSo I think 1) is the proper play IF everyone is good at the game. If I'm the Vi and im smurfing in silver like this game elo is, then I would take those 2 waves because none of you are thinking about the above and it is best to play for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will say there is also a 3rd scenario of Vi just leaving immediately which is completely atrocious but since the comment is quite long I will only detail it if needed.",

He would then come in basic attack get the kill and leave. He kept doing this in every lane. We ended up loses and my teammates were saying it was his fault he was also stealing kills from adc. He then claims to have best k/d on team and we were getting diffed. I wanna try jungle but is this the way it\u2019s suppose to be played?\n\nEdit I realize I misspelled blame the dyslexia.",

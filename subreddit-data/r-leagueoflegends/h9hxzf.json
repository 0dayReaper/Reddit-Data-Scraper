    "postText": "TL;DR: I'm old but Gold.\n\nI've been playing League for over nine years now, and the dream always was to be above average. It's not a big dream, but there you go.\n\nWhen we still had ELO, that meant being above 1200 (I never was). As soon as we had the ranked system, I wanted to be Gold. That's where the shiny borders are. That's where you get skins. That's where you can tell people you're actually kinda decent at this game.\n\nThe problem always was that I suck. My already non-existent mechanical skills managed to deteriorate even further after I hit 40. I also can't play every day, since my family and my job come first. And there's always too much happening on the screen for me to follow. I regularly confuse my own character with one of my teammates. I'm incapable of outplaying anyone.\n\nSo what I do is play braindead champions in the toplane, disable chat, ward as much as possible, bash towers whenever I can, and let the young folk carry me.\n\nThis afternoon it finally happened. I goofed around on Garen a bit while my Draven killed everyone and everything, and at the end of that game I was Gold. I'm absolutely ecstatic, but no one I know plays League. In fact, everyone I know thinks I'm a bit of a twat to still play videogames at my age. But to me this is a big thing.\n\nSo there you go. And I'm pretty sure if I can do this, any one of you can too!",

Press R when it\u2019s available. And one of the best feelings in the game is hitting a fully charged Sion Q. People look down on brain dead champs but they\u2019re so fun and always reliable.",

But then he was also, like, the only truly safe blind-pickable top for 6 months or so, and it was a period where I was playing a lot so I would always end up blinding Sion and having to learn to play it into everything...years later and, like, Sion's one of my go-to champions if I don't know what to play and I do really enjoy playing him.  Playing a champion who is just fairly hard to fuck up with is always nice.",

Each gun has a Q, and augments his Ult in a specific way when they are his primary gun and R is pressed. Many of his abilities/guns involve applying/consuming marks. \n\nGuns at the start of the game are always Green/Red. Green is the sniper rifle, red is short-medium range with lifesteal. You basically can't force him out of lane until Red runs out. He uses Green to harass with autos+Q, and heals with Red. From there, he gets random guns when they run out of ammo.\n\nBlue, beware the AoE damage. The blue Ult WAS one-shotting teams months ago, and it still does good damage if you clump. Also, Blue+Runaan's is nasty if you're stacked. Spread out. Q shoots a wave that marks you, which he follows up by hitting you with the off-hand. Short-range. \n\nPurple, beware the roots/slows. The Q will root a marked target. Marks are applied when he autos you with Purple, or by his abilities where applicable. It's the least likely to kill you, but most likely to get you killed by his team or save him. So, look at the map. The ult applies a large slow, but no mark. Once he's in range he can stick to you, but he's still short-ranged.\n\nRed grants lifesteal and a short-range blitz attack for Q. Nasty damage and alternates weapons (applying marks), but you can play back and poke him. It's a mediocre sustain tool and good if you're jumping into him, but useless against range and requires minions to heal off. Ult grants him a flat heal if it hits something with it. Not a large one, and no scaling.\n\nGreen has a long-range skillshot for a Q. Get hit by Calibrum during any Q, and you're marked. He autos you after that from a huge distance using the off-hand, and can follow up with the other ability if applicable. Other than that, it's just long range. Think Caitlyn, except not as good. The green Ult marks you for a follow-up shot, just like the Q. \n\nWhite is the gun people don't respect, in my experience. White lets him shred anything stationary, and you if you're dumb enough to get in melee range, because **white gains increased attack speed based on the proximity of the target**. If you stand on top of him, his AS goes through the roof. If you're 500 units away, it goes down. Hitting enemies with abilities spawns Chakrams, which increase the damage of each attack. The Ult instantly stacks his chakrams.  Aphelios with White murders idiots who try to jump him. White's Q places his other gun as a sentry turret, applying marks as applicable. Red/White quickly stacks chakrams, White/Green lets him use chakrams at range, white/blue gives him an AoE turret plus the chakrams. This is the \"I have insane damage, run away\" gun.\n\nGranted, that's... a lot to take in. But, it basically boils down to \"Red is sustain, White is DPS, Green is ranged, Blue is AoE, Purple is CC. Getting hit by his Q causes him to apply/consume marks, and then the other gun does its thing.\" \n\nSo, how do you deal with him?\n\nThe BEST solution is to pick Syndra/Vel'Koz/Xerath and kill him from range. Note that most of his guns are short-ranged, and Green isn't his highest DPS tool. He has garbage magic resist. So, that's really effective. Even if you just chunk him to 15%, he's now out of the fight. Aphelios can't build defensive items other than PD and maybe DD, and those come in third/fourth at the earliest. For a long time, he has no defensive tools. \n\nSecond-best (at least in my opinion) is to pick Malphite and ult him. He kinda just dies, like every other Marksman, and the AS slow Malphite has will cripple him if the initial burst isn't quite enough. AP Malphite will literally one-shot him with the Ult. Armour Malphite will do 40% of his health, and stick on top of him with Q/E crippling his ability to deal damage. Both are ultimately successful, in most cases. \n\nThe worst solution is to pick four melee champions that want to jump onto Aphelios, then bitch about how a champion that excels at murdering enemies really close to him is OP when you run right at him. Because, that's stupid. Learn something else. Want some suggestions? \n\n* Top - Neeko, Malphite, Karma, Cho'Gath\n* Jungle - Malphite, Karthus, Shyvanna, Graves\n* Mid - Xerath, Syndra, Vel'Koz, Malphite, Varus, Karma\n* Bot - Syndra, Xerath, Vel'Koz, Varus, Senna, Ezreal, Karma\n* Support - Karma, Xerath, Vel'Koz, Senna\n\nIf you pick Sett/Jarvan/Galio/Kalista/Thresh into Aphelios, you're gonna have a bad time. If you draft Malphite/Graves/Syndra/Ezreal/Karma, Aphelios will look like a useless champion. \n\nYes, I REALLY like Malphite as an Aphelios answer. He does well into Wu Kong, which is pretty big in the LPL, and is just generally useful. People don't play enough Malphite. He has plenty of winning lanes, and functions from behind if that's where you end up.",

I mained support, had around a 60-70% win rate in my placements, I ended up in Iron 1.\n\nYesterday I tried playing Jhin for the first time in ranked. I was much lower rank than the rest of the players in the match, and my support immediately started asking why they were matched with an Iron player. I said I had no idea and focused on playing.\n\nThe enemy ADC was much better than me, but I avoided feeding (only died twice, and the second time was about 3 seconds before we took the nexus) and did the best I could to ward, participate in teamfights, and take objectives.\n\nIn the postgame lobby, my support made fun of my damage dealt, but y'know what? I did the best I could, I went 4/2/13, and we won. So screw the haters.",

I started playing ranked in season 2 and always tried to be that sick OTP producing montage plays every 2 seconds. Over the years I mained Lee Sin, Yasuo, Zed, Fizz, Lucian etc. and I never made it out of gold. Eventually I came to the realization that mechanics are simply not my strength, but macro game and game sense is. I'm still playing midlane as my main role but instead of trying to go for solokills all the time when there are no real opportunities and trying to be that deadly OTP, I climb by having decent wave control, warding, map awareness and general macro. I'm now Diamond whereas the highest I've ever been with my old playstyle was Gold 2 or something. Good midlane picks for this playstyle are Galio, Malzahar, most glacial augment users, Lissandra, TF, Ryze imo.",

Work , family(if u have some) , the need to work out since your body is starting to function badly if you don't take care of it , and your social life is what keeps a lot of people from playing as much.\n\nEven i barely play a couple of games per week. i'm mostly on reddit rather then even playing the game curently.",

It may explain why the friends that you have left dropped. People forget that this is one of the world's richest, most widespread entertainment industries and shun their grown-up consumers, while you have 40-50 year olds burning hours per week watching Netflix and Reality TV Shows like it ain't nobody's business.\n\nThe fact that you haven't given up on video-games (or any hobby for that matter) as you grew older is just a sign that you preserved your individuality at an age where people expect you to sacrifice all that you are for something else (kids, careers, wife, etc) as you do the grind.\n\nYou may not game as much as you used to, you may never be able to outplay a decent teenage gamer anymore, but the single fact that you're still having fun and investing in a hobby that is a part of you, is something that so many people your age lack out there.\n\nThis is your victory. In every sense of the word. Congratulations for hitting Gold, welcome aboard.",

            "comment": "Congrats on hitting gold from one old timer to another.  :)\n\nI've only been playing since around season 5, but last season was the first time I managed to hit gold (so sad I missed Victorious Morgana skin and got Aatrox instead  D: ).\n\nAs someone who is \"old enough to be everyone's mom\" in League I understand what a big accomplishment this is. You have other responsibilities, less time to play, and the slower mechanical reactions that come with age. Don't let anyone diminish your sense of pride.\n\nI also think continuing to play games as an adult does a lot to keep you mentally sharp. League is like 3 Dimensional chess where you only get to control some of the pieces. It's always changing and presenting new challenges and circumstances. And if you can learn to play League without letting the general toxicity and pressure get to you, you can become practically a zen lord when it comes to dealing with real life stress. If you have to choose between games and tv, surely games are much more intellectually stimulating. \n\nI've always felt the same way... that my mechanics are just \"okay\" most of the time, but learning about controlling vision around objectives and reading the overall macro state of the game is where older people can really shine in League. We aren't so prone to falling into that \"1 vs. 9 in the jungle, perpetual death match at 20 minutes\" mentality that your typical 20 year old Yasuo is plagued with.   ;)\n\nCongrats again!",

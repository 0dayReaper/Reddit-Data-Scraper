And this discrepancy will only increase the lower the elo.\n\nOn top of that you should keep in mind you are matched with players of similar skill level. They will make mistakes, you will make mistakes.\n\nIt is not your place, your job, your right ot whatever to flame them for making those mistake.\n\nThe problem is introspection is hard, it's easy to blame allies for making mistakes and blaming them for your inability to climb/win games. It's much harder to look for your own mistakes, and more importantly your own lack of abusing the enemies mistake. Because those are also people of similar skill, making the same amount of mistakes.\n\nAnd yes it's frustrating that a decent amount of games will be decided just by #mistakes your team &lt;&gt; #mistakes enemy team, regardless of how you play.\n\n\nBut I never understand the point of flaming someone for a \"mistake\", and I deliberately quote it, since it's you thinking they made a mistake. They likely think it's the correct play. It's just shitty behavior to flame people.",

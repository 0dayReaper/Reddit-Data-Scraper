Will probably do damage to its attackers somehow or function as a longer range single use yasuo windwall/Fiora parry?\n* Will have true damage somewhere\n* Will be a slow heavy hitter like Jhin, Caitlyn or Graves\n* Will have a repeatable ally on-hit effect that fits in with her as an auto attacker in general, but her low AS will make her want someone else to apply auto attacks quickly alongside her.\n* Will want help sticking to targets\n* Will make use of Lucian's W movespeed well while Lucian makes good use of a late game damage source from Senna as well as protection as a shorter range ADC. Will have surprising effectiveness with Kalista or maybe Ashe/Sivir\n* I wonder if Lucian will receive a mini change to his passive that lets him back with Senna? I don't think they'll have free in-combat synergy like Xayah Rakan though\n* Has CC of some sort\n* Everyone will try her literally everywhere else and she'll actually be decent at least as ADC.\n\nEDIT: I just realised I predicted the supp marksman thing literally 30 mins - 1 hr ?

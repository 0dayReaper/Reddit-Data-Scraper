I can play any role and I\u2019d do better than the average player.",

In which case where does rank actually becomes a symbol of \"impressive\" play? Top 5 percent? Top .05 percent? That subjective. People will argue you on that. But nobody can argue that Plat is the top 10 percent of players. Statistically speaking being better than 90 to 95 percent of people at a practice does make you considerably skilled. \n\nMy argument is numbers and nothing I've said is debatable. Everything you're saying is debatable. That's the difference. What you're saying is your opinion. What I'm saying is a fact.",

You will allways HAVE to pick the currently meta champions but meta is shifting, you need to define your \"pocket picks\" now during your time in gold thats what it was about for me pocket picks are champions you can play solid with no matter the enemy no matter the meta you need to know how to play advantage as well as how to play from behind with them...\n\nShortly that was my journey from gold to plat... for more info feel free to DM me",

Well, that's almost pointless. The only thing you should be worrying about is getting more cs (6.1 is ridiculously low for a Malzahar that thinks he should be climbing), and you should be killing your opponent more. \n\nYou're playing a DPS champion, go DPS. You do support levels of damage in most of your games, and you die so much too. Look for ways to deal damage until you start to feel uncomfortable when you aren't hitting the enemy. Then, and only then, draw back so you die less.",

So not exactly the Plat advice you're probably hoping for, but I think you should still want to hear what I have to say.\n\nA lot of things OP says doesn't feel right to me. He says Malz is a DPS champion and it's true Malz is capable of doing great damage, but he's not a carry type, he's a disabler with good dot. He's also not great at forcing fights, but rather at punishing enemy mistakes. Maybe the person who commented didn't use these terms literally, they were just trying to say you seem to not do much in each of ur games and you should try to get more damage and kp in, not literally that you need to dps more and force fights.\n\n&gt;Look for ways to deal damage until you start to feel uncomfortable when you aren't hitting the enemy. Then, and only then, draw back so you die less.\n\nI really really disagree with this. You're Malzahar. You don't want to be in someone's face all the time. This advice doesn't even sound good in general.\n\nI think as Malzahar you don't want to be aggressive and starting fights, but you should definitely strive to be at fights that are happening already. Your game history shows variable DPS, I don't think that's necessarily the main issue, but that's how I would approach getting more DPS in your games. Again, not forcing fights, just being there.\n\nYour deaths do seem slightly on the high end? Yeah this might be due to positioning: Malzahar's R disables both you and the enemy so you generally want to at least try to be in a decent spot before using (there's exceptions ofc. like say there's a fed kogmaw you just need to take out even at the cost of your own life). I think general map awareness is also good for preventing deaths. \n\nI also really don't think warding too much is an issue. 6 control wards a game to me sounds fine as long as your farm is decent. I think the important thing here is just to make sure you're placing good control wards.\n\nLooking at the other comments, you seem a little hung up on your former Plat rank and you seem to lament about warding \"not being good enough anymore\" or something like that. I think that's bs. You're not plat because over time, players have improved and you haven't such that you're just not plat anymore (one of the top comments mentioned this i believe). Warding is still important, you just have to improve in other aspects too.",

Also if you put them in spots where they get found easily you're just feeding your enemies gold and XP. \n\nDon't get me wrong you should ward but do it efficiently.

            "comment": "The thing is, anyone who tells you that a specific tip or trick will get you out of a specific ELO range would be lying to both you and themselves.\n\nThe reality is that incremental improvements in *any* of the fundamental skills (from last-hitting to warding, map awareness, wave management, laning + trading, map rotations, team fighting, building flexibly, and managing mentality/avoiding tilt) will lead to an increase in rating on average.  A game is won when one team makes more good decisions/plays and less bad ones than the enemy team.\n\nUltimately, to get to a higher rank, you need to increase your winrate.  What factors both increase the chances you win and are within your control?  All of those things I listed above and more.\n\nA mistake more novice players might make is assuming that there's not much room for improvement left for them in any one of those skills I mentioned.  *There is always room to improve no matter your skill level*.  Focus on one or two of those skills and make a deliberate effort to hone them both in and out of your games (lots of helpful guides, resources, and comments on reddit for any of them).\n\nFinally, never ever fixate on the performance of your teammates - they are just a random element that are an inevitable thing you need to adapt to and play around.  Sometimes you get good teammates and you will need to learn to minimize your mistakes so they can carry you.  Sometimes you'll get bad teammates who you will need to accommodate for (but this is never something to blame for being stuck - enemy teams also get bad players).  The biggest indicator of \"scrub mentality\" in this game is blaming losses on teammates and attributing one's inability to \"I always get bad teammates.\"  More on that in this enlightened [ramble](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/30xznn/how_to_improve_your_play_at_any_skill_level/) I wrote a few years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**  There are a ton of fundamental skills and habits within the game that each increase your chances of winning.  No one fundamental is the universal answer to pass a certain ELO.  Getting better on any of them will make you a better player, and a better player will win more games on average than a worse one.",

You have a big pool so just pick some that you like and are strong in the meta.\nNext take an hour in the practice tool and READ every champions every single ability and number.

And Malzahar can only properly do the first after level 6, and can't do the second at all.\n\nHe's mostly a supportive pick, but gives up way too much agency pre-6 for what he offers post 6, so he loses on pressure to early roamers, and loses HARD to hyperscalers since he doesn't really have solo kill pressure early.\n\nHis winrate will always be fine since he's very good at shutting down your opponent - press R in fights vs assassins, or shove endlessly after midgame, but he's more of a \"not lose\" rather than a \"win\" champ, and only really gets a significant advantage alone if the enemy gets impatient",

You can also play stuff like fizz/zed and just Giga stomp lane and win that way. Annie also works if you really want a mage.  \n\nBut yeah if you are gonna play mages it\u2019s not gonna be fun. ( obv you can get out quick with them if you are a lot better than gold, but if you are just a bit better like play it\u2019s hard these days lol). \n\nAlso, dodge big comp diffs, especially if you can tell by the champs that your botlane is gonna end up 0/5 very easily.",

I think i can give sound advice. \n\nHonestly I've come on reddit and lurked and asked the same questions as you and applied other peoples theories...even though everyone says play what you enjoy and you will climb, learning macro/micro, farm well, Youre just not good enough, you're farm is too low etc, your op.gg etc. Its not all good advice coz there's not game context. Theory and reality are different and their games aren't necessarily like yours. Same goes for LP gains and losses. (I just got out with 19lp for a win -29 for a loss)\n\nAnd I can elaborate on every point if u wish after but I'll try to keep it short for my first response\n\nPlay what u enjoy &lt; play what's OP/can 1v9\nTanks for top (front line wins in low elo), aoe or CC for mid, aoe hyperscalers bot preferably with some selfpeel.\nPlay a lane with more agency unless ur VERY good in a particular role \nDon't focus too much on 10cs per min. Just try to have more farm than your opponent and then try to be at all tfs if possible especially if its getting to late game where one fight can end/flip the game.\nFind runes and items that work for YOU and how u play. Not the best runes and items with the highest WR. That was the big one for me\n\nAnd this one worked for me but I dunno for others. I rarely pushed. The pros just never outweighed the cons\n\nI won 15 of my last 20 games and climbed from like g4 to plat in the last few days.\n\nLike I said some of it sounds off and backwards to what everyone said but it worked for my games. And nobody knows my games better than me. \n\nI dunno about jung unfortunately",

The chances of all of them being \"just bad\" are actually pretty low.\n\nI could make the same argument about UK players btw: For years, there were barely any, at times none relevant UK players in the LEC/LCS. If we narrow it down to English players, it gets even worse, as Alphari is Welsh. Does that mean all players that come from England just suck and we shouldn't give a rising English talent a chance, if they deserve it? Absolutely not.",

Not just the charity spots given to them for play-in stages...  \n\n\nThis esport is so bloated with shit teams across the world that talking about the reputation of one league that can't even threaten real teams at global events seems hilariously melodramatic.   \n\n\nNA included as a major region with way too much money.  \n\n\nIf this was traditional sports, there would be one league and it could probably house about 20 teams *max* of top tier talent. The rest would be absolute farm teams.  \n\n\nThis game is way too bloated with shit teams and shit regions.",

The feminist way of interpreting it as I understand it is that gaming has traditionally been regarded as a boy\u2019s activity and that translates beyond just a general lack of encouragement for women to game into men and boys enforcing that stereotype via the \u201cegirl\u201d memes, assuming an account with a certain kind of username and a penchant for playing Nami or Janna only has to be a girl, often harassment, etc. \n\nI do have a problem with this team and it\u2019s the org appropriating a good cause for publicity. The women are faultless.\n\nYour last sentence also makes no sense. It seems like just pure naivety that you think more women would be in the scene if they \u201cshould be\u201d. Translate that to other issues, how about \u201cless people would be poor if there should be less poor people\u201d? \u201cThere would be fewer racists out there if there should be\u201d?",

But I do know that there are female players who are in challenger at least and would be worth putting in a team for pro play. Again, males dominate the pro scene but perhaps that's because they also dominate the whole playerbase by a large margin. I'd personally like to see more female players in general playing the game. There are a lot of female streamers who play league already and soon I hope to see more and more females playing league in general. League's not only a game for men, girls can go play and enjoy it too... and play at a very high level and compete against the best!\n\nAnyway here's some thoughts nonetheless:\n\n1. (most likely) The ones who are qualified aren't picked by teams because they have other players they think are more qualified.\n2. (highly unlikely) The female players who are qualified and are invited for pro play don't want to.\n3. (highly unsure about this one and I would appreciate a correction as its most likely false) Teams in general prefer same gender due to cultural and/or housing reasons? It's easier to put 5 male players in one house where they could practice non-stop than putting one sole female in the mix. (There are a lot of instances of girls and boys living together yes but some cultures frown upon it maybe?)\n\nIt'll be nice to see more girls in the pro scene competing in high level play against the best. People/Teams/Organizations should keep encouraging more girls to go play the game. It's fun and enjoyable and if they feel competitive enough and qualified they should go pro. At the same time reputable female personalities would be great inspiration for girls who wish to play but are afraid to play due to \"exclusion on the boys only club\". On that note. Twitch rivals have a decent number of female players playing and they're pretty good as well. And people enjoyed watching them. There's no reason why it wouldn't be possible in higher level of play!\n\nedit: Just remembered Mayumi's a pro female player. the 1st one.   \nedit 2: if you're not satisfied with the above then this vid may explain it better  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuOS8tmMZ2E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuOS8tmMZ2E)",

I'm sure having a better balanced gender proportion would help league grow as esport. My gf doesn't look at all at League, but maybe if there was a girl player in some team maybe it could get her watching some games.",

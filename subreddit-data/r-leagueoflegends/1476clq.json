    "postText": "I've seen lots of posts complaining about smurfs lately.  I'm not saying it isn't frustrating but duo smurfs are much much worse.  I'm really hoping when we add this new Emerald divison duo queue is removed and we get real solo queue finally.\n\nIf duos can't be completely removed, then let's at least remove it from Emerald and higher.  Duos belong in normals or flex queue.  Let's have a real solo queue so players can test their skill against other solo players.",

I'll hop on a smurf to learn a new champ or role for example, I think that is a legit use of smurfing because the alternative is having me first time a new champ in a diamond game.\n\nWhat I don't like is when a high elo streamer plays their well practiced OTP just to smash people",

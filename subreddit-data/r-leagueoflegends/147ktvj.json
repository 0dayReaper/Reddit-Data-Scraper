However, the two highest win rates are actually EWQ (3rd down) and EQW (2nd from bottom).  I would lean towards WEQ just due to the high win rate and pick rate, but it makes me wonder if E max is the best, but just not popular yet.\n\n######DIAMOND+ JUNGLE\n\nFor jungle, Q max does look noticeably better, with her worst two builds in the top 7 both being W max, which includes her most popular build. Her jungle pick rate is so low that it's hard to draw anything conclusive from this, so lets see if these patterns hold in Platinum+.\n\n###Rell Platinum+ Data Comparison\n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/KWqZYas.png) is the data for Rell support and jungle in Platinum+.\n\n######PLATINUM+ SUPPORT\n\nOnce again, both W max and E max are both viable, with W max being noticeably more popular. The E max build (EWQ) has a noticeably higher win rate, though it only has a 6% pick rate. This is the same build with the highest win rate in Diamond+.\n\n######PLATINUM+ JUNGLE\n\nWe have a lot more games to look at in Platinum+, and it's much more clear that Q max is the way. The three Q max builds in the top 7 only differ in the order of their first three skills, while still averaging out at a very high win rate.\n\n###Conclusions\n\nI don't play Rell, but I would say EWQ on Support and QWE on Jungle are the way to go, just looking at the data. They look noticeably better when it comes to win rate, and this trend does hold in both normal elo and high elo.\n\nFor what it's worth, I took a look at the Gold-only data too, and the pattern holds there as well.",

Yes if the melee assassin is fed you can die fast, but if they are level 2-3 invading you, generally you can live long enough until someone collapses. She also straight wins into Kayn in the 1v1, as he can't get through her shield and you can just auto him down, then you can interrupt his E to prevent him from healing.\n\nVery fun champ, extremely oppressive.

Similar to my main, Sejuani, with more durability and AOE CC, but weaker initiation because she can't CC at long range like Sejuani's R lets her do.\n\nI've been maxing Q, since Crash Down is on a relatively long cooldown that doesn't decrease with levels and it also doesn't directly combo with E. For jungling per se, the additional attack speed is pretty minor because you have so much ability damage, and the durability increase isn't huge (plus, you're durable enough to heal pretty rapidly from jungling on any level of W). Her single-target clear starts off a bit slow, but by level 3 she's quite fast, and once she hits level 4, she's on par with the fastest junglers. This is not really getting nerfed next patch, so I'm happy.\n\nRell is relatively decent at not dying to invades early on, and it's always nice to snag free assists by pressing E and hasting someone in a fight you aren't even involved in. One slightly amusing problem is that she can get fast enough unmounted that I sometimes erroneously believe I am mounted and am surprised to find that my W does not take me over walls.\n\nBuild-wise, I've built fairly standard tank jungle items. She has absurd AP ratios vs jungle monsters (this patch; that's getting replaced by flat damage bonuses), but by the time you can get any reasonable amount of AP, you already evaporate camps, so it's not really needed. Iceborn Gauntlet is great on her as additional CC, and she tends to somewhat spread out her ability uses to best layer CC, so it works well with her kit.\n\nI imagine that Trundle would be a fairly lousy matchup for her. He's generally good vs tanks, and Crash Down has a slow enough animation that a good Trundle could probably interrupt it with a pillar pretty reliably.",

Success is about getting knocked down, time after time, and getting back up.\n\nNo one embodies that more than Tyler Steinkamp.\n\nTyler1. He is one of the most jacked and tall marksmen/jungle/top in NA and the World, but regardless of that resum\u00e9, he has never won a 1 vs 1 against anyone, but he has never lost his drive.\n\nAnd what's more, is that even a couple of years ago, even making Twitch Rivals final seemed out of reach.\n\nUntil 2018. Everything was set up to perfection for T1 after getting unbanned. He reconquered NA after years of Yassuo and Tarzaned domination. But as we all know, it was a tragedy. Tyler1 was chat restricted every game and couldn't climb. It was a shameful display, and what was worse, it felt like a lost opportunity that may never come again, for Riot, for Draven players and for T1.\n\nThe most beta streamers rose as having the most viewers. And Tarzaned would dominate the Ranked ladder two times in a row. But T1, he did not stop fighting, and in fact in 2019, he was finally able to put one of his biggest demons to bed, creating Shadowdogs Unleashed and winning the whole twitch rivals without dropping a game!\n\nAnd now? Now we're here. 2020. Where the expectations for T1 were at their lowest ahead of this ranked ladder climb playing TOP. The worst bronze players that has beaten T1 down in this lane, time and time again; and TFblade, standing tall and poised to be rank 1 again.\n\nBut so far we haven't gotten TFblade domination, we haven't gotten the Tarzaned highlight reels, and we've gotten T1 and Mordekaiser lane kingdom.\n\nIt all comes down to this next promotion series. Demons can be slayed, expectations be damned, and T1 can cement himself as the player he always wanted to prove he was.\n\nIn this next 3 games, it's all up to him and his Mordekaiser to make their dreams come true.",

Tyler1 is a content king and plays a similar role that Asmon plays for the WoW community: a lot of people got something to say about them both but they have a passion for the game they play. Like what people are saying though, Tyler is beyond Asmon in his current position with his skits, constant grinding, retaining same viewership even if he switched to variety, etc. Dude's a monster. Looking forward to seeing what happens, hopefully some more collabs with Faker in the distant future.\n\nAlso wanna point out how you can tell absolutely nothing really changed: Dude went on to shit talking Joe instantly. Love how they didn't try to filter and muzzle him at all. They know what the people like.\n\nEdit: Changed some wording around.",

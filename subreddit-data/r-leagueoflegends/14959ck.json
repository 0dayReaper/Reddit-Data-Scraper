It's your secret weapon for bot lane supremacy.\n\nI've broken down all the basics of what an ADC is, and I've dug into the different types of champs that can be ADCs - like Marksmen, Assassins, and Fighters. I've also shared some of my top ADC-Support combos, with a deep dive into pairs like Vayne and Anivia, Jhin and Xerath, and more.\n\nBut there's even more! I've also revealed my top secret tips on warding and trading techniques. Basically, it's your fast track to becoming an ADC pro.\n\nCheck it out here: [**How to Play ADC in League of Legends**](https://understandinglol.com/how-to-play-adc/)\n\nI'm eager to hear what you guys think!

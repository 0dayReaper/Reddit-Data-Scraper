    "postText": "Riot recently announced a couple of changes to clash, one of them is reducing the amount of Clash Tournaments by 50%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**These changes are the 3 short-term fixes to major issues:**\n\n1. Players who forfeit after losing the first game\n\nThey will be changing the way the rewards work from ranking-based to win-lose-based\n\n2. Clash's overall reliability\n\nChanges to how they monitor and support Clash servers and code to provide more stability\n\n3. \"And making Clash an experience worth planning around\"\n\nThis is where they announce that Clash will be monthly instead of bi-weekly from now on.\n\nThe amount of Victory points received will be doubled, while the amount needed for the rewards will stay the same\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first two seem like perfectly fine fixes, but man, one Clash per month is really shitty in my opinion.\n\nNot only does that just mean less Clash games with friends (duh), it also fucks over anyone who just happens to be doing something else on that particular weekend - which could also mean the VP rewards are \"tougher\" to get, since you can't miss that many Clash-weekends\n\nIn addition, they announced more non Summoners Rift Clashes (most notibly ARAM Clashes in both August and December this year). So out of the 5 remaining Clashes this year (there seems to be no Clash planned for November, see the Blogpost below) only 3 will be the \"regular kind\", where you and four friends come together and tryhard (and have fun!) on Summoners Rift, as if it was an organized scrim.\n\nThis essentially means one \"proper\" Clash every two months - that's.... not a lot\n\nYes, yes, ARAM-Clashes... but let's be real here, who really wants to tryhard in ARAM?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVideo (with timestamp):  [https://youtu.be/WUttY3xVF1Q?t=109](https://youtu.be/WUttY3xVF1Q?t=109) \n\nBlogpost: [https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/clash-changes-and-split-2-schedule/](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/clash-changes-and-split-2-schedule/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is your opinion on this topic?",

            "comment": "I love the idea of Clash. To me, League is at its most fun when you're in a 5-man party, and the majority of league players probably never get that full experience.\n\nNot sure why Riot hasn't leaned into it more. I agree with other people here that a monthly clash is dumb. It's such a bad feeling if you miss one you have to wait an entire month again, and potentially even two months if you don't want to do the ARAM one.\n\nHopefully we see something like the premier system from Valorant added in. The older I get, the less interest I have in grinding solo queue, and the more interest I have in playing with my friends when I am able to be on.\n\nI'm in a golf league - and it makes Tuesday's something to look forward to each week. I'd love something like that for League where I know Wednesday's are my \"League league\" and I have to play a BO3 or something with my boys. I know there are amateur leagues out there, but I'd love to see a built-in version some day.",

            "comment": "Riotmeddler:\n\nThe shift back to monthly isn't about population size, but about how we've seen people engage with clash, sentiment about it, perceived specialness etc. At biweekly we see a lot more \"I'll just wait for the next one\"/\"this happens often enough it isn't that special\"/\"it's hard to get my team together all the time\". In retrospect the monthly schedule we originally had for Clash looks like it was a better fit for a larger time commitment that requires some preparation and in exchange should be more of a high moment",

            "comment": "Agreed. And tbh, I think this change in particular will be bad and make clash participation even less than what they think it will.\n\nWith the bi-weekly clash like we have at the moment, you can play regulary with your friends and if some can't play, it's fine, you can cancel and play the next one without any trouble.\n\nBut now, if someone has something scheduled for the days they announced clash, they will feel bad to miss out since there are so few now. Not everyone put League above IRL priorities.\n\nAnother thing is, it can create loss of motivation to play further clash, especially if you often do 0-3 or 1-2 with your team. Even tho the rewards are a bit better, you still need to win or win most of your matches to get the best rewards. And with so few clashes in the year now, what's the point of playing?\n\nAt least, with the bi-weekly schedule, you could keep trying your best until you eventually win. I don't think people would have the patience to wait one year to win a clash tournament.",

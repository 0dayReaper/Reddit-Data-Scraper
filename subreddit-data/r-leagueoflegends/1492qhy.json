I wasn't super good at editing in 2018 but the picture turned out pretty good regardless! It's probably not very popular anymore since this game produces content at the speed of light but it will forever hold a very special place in my heart &lt;3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65qheas05y5b1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=09009e8c6cbad5fb891b77d5630449949f286ab0",

A bunch of things here really made this shot pop, the combination of the props you used especially like the glasses and sleeves+rings; your pose/demeanor plus whatever magic you did with the image edit/filters made this look insanely cool. \n\nHella impressive. not really a wonder it's still one of your favs honestly one of the coolest cosplay shots I've seen",

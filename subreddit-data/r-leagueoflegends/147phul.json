Xiaohao has been one of the best junglers since he joined the LPL though, just had a bad split in spring. Shame he's wasting his talent on AL, would be sick if he was on TES or OMG instead. Zorah could probably be good for an entire split and I'd still not be sold on him because he has in 90% of games just been a disaster tier player.",

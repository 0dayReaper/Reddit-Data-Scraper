    "postText": "I just got to Gold for the first time last week and now am working to get enough SP for the ranked skin.\n\nHowever the skin meter on the ranked page hasn\u2019t changed in any way since I hit gold. It seems like it\u2019s still tracking SP as if I\u2019m in Silver (I.e. 1,600 points needed for skin). \n\nI\u2019ve played 6 games since getting to Gold and would like to have some sort of idea how close I am to the skin. Right now it seems like it\u2019s not even tracking it.\n\nIs this just a client bug or what?",

If you're uncertain and want to be safe it's 10 sp per win and 6 per loss so you can manually calculate what you've gained from your games while in gold.",

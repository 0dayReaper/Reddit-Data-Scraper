They obliterated EDG and BLG afterwards. The T1 one they were still in control for a vast majority of the series. Tf does \"inconsistent in bo5\" even mean here?",

Currently across the summer split JKL is by far TES best player followed by Tian. Wayward has been mostly solid, but not top tier by any means. Rookie has been a non-factor in 4 out of 5 series - mostly a passenger - but hard work was done by JKL/Tian, except for the last series vs WBG when he woke the fuck up in game 2 and 3 and schooled Xiaohu. Hopefully this form continues now.",

He literally doesn't even frontline for JKL, often he's even outright griefing him like in the EDG series where he's standing right beside him and can save his life in 1238123 different ways, chooses to not utilize even one of those ways and kills himself after he lets JKL die. Wayward is a disaster tier player, he plays a role and champions that are supposed to buy space in teamfights, yet JKL is literally buying Wayward more space per fucking game than Wayward would buy JKL for an entire split.  \n\nIf Tian/Wayward was good then this team would've still done things even without JKL, but everyone who has watched TES this split knows that they would've lost pretty much every game they've won but 2 of them if not for JKL.",

Ruler is great, top 2-3 imo but the reason he looked like he did at MSI because he has the two of the best solo laners in the world who also happen to be the best at peeling adcs in an adc meta. Bin may be better than 369 in lane but no way he protects Ruler the way 369 did. 369 and Knight are much further ahead of the competition than Ruler is. 369 because of his ability to go beyond just laning and diving backline in teamfights and Knight because Knight. I'm not even convinced Ruler is better than Elk when he literally has the best ADC meta team in the world",

JDG literally played so perfect for their adc that I would say they could have won with anyone of: JKL / Guma / Elk / Gala / Viper / Light and possibly worse adcs. Ruler played pretty good but I would rather say if you put him on any other team in MSI he doesn\u2019t win because he simply does nothing to really elevate the team. I would even argue that another Chinese adc would do even better due to better communication and not having to work on that for a lot of spring.\n\nLike in Grand finals swap bot lanes and tell me JDG doesn\u2019t still win, change mid/jgl and I have BLG winning",

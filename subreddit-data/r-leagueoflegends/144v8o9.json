Also, what do you personally put your attack move on? I have mine on left click, A feels like it takes my finger off my abilities too much.",

Personally, I can't use attack move on A at all, and I put it on press, and on left click, so I can right click, left click, right click, left click for kiting.",

There settings are set to locked screen, not unlocked and then hitting or holding space bar like you or I probably do when we want the screen locked. \n\nMaybe if instead of just assuming everything you decided is law, you\u2019d be less insufferable and grow as a person if you\u2019d give new information a chance\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s not always about winning and losing.

Ofc if it goes 5.0, 6.0 attack speed then such apm is probably not sustainable, but with adc having 3.5-ish attack speed, that equates to about 10-12 actions per second, with the same mouse movement",

But they use them because it simply feels good to them or because they're used to it. Doesn't matter if it's suboptimal either.\n\nFor example, did you know Shiphtur frequently moves his camera with the *arrow* keys? With his *left* hand no less? Like, he moves his hand from the left side of the keyboard all the way to the right side. You can watch vods of his where you can see his arm and you'll see it make wide movements every so often while his camera moves around.\n\nThere's also Allorim who while he didn't have an expansive pro career, he's consistently been a challenger player and he moves his camera and rests his fingers on WASD. Abilities on Q, E, R , F iirc. His is less weird as it stems from his experience from playing WoW but it's unorthodox by LoL standards.\n\nReckful, considered to be amongst the absolute top players of WoW PvP, strafed his character with Z and X and moved forward by holding down his mouse (the latter a thing done by a lot of WoW players but unlike Reckful most still have a dedicated move forward button).\n\nIn the end it's all about what works for you and whether you're comfortable with it. If you're comfortable with it and it's working, there's no real reason to change things up.",

We're likely talking 2-10 times a second, occasionally even more. \n\nmeanwhile jackeylove: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKwhXjLiVhE doesnt even use it once, at least from what I saw (aa range indicator not showing). \n\nDoublelift has also famously said that he doesnt use attack move or attack move click. He just right clicks and move his mouse, he also acknowledged that its bad to misclick and accidentally \"run forward\". Honestly people like DL/high elo players generally have very accurate click and are really fast with the mouse so it rarely happens to them, and if it does they are quick to click back anyway.  Its mainly champs like yasuo in the middle of a minion wave that might be hard to click, but attack move wont really help you there either.  \n\nAlso, DL might have started using it since then, I have no clue (havent watched him much). I can just remember that this is what he said in S8-S9 (it was not crazy long ago, but maybe im off by a year or two).\n\nAt the end of the day none of this actually matters much. Its all preference and what you are used to. I dont think it would take you more than 50 games to actually change ur settings and get used to playing differently though (if you want to do that, all I am saying is that it wont really help you climb). \n\nThe reason you arent challenger isnt because you don't play with the same settings that some of these really good pro's use. There are players in challenger with unbelievably bad settings, so if they can hit challenger with their bad settings, why cant you? There are challenger players playing with all kind of settings (even settings most people would argue are non-ideal/outright bad), and even default settings, or the exact same settings as you do. You can honestly argue that what DL is doing is non-ideal since he can accidentally run forward (while for instance orb walking). Same with guma, why attack move when you can attack move click. Im sure there are challenger players that normal cast all/some of their spells as well, which is by definition non-ideal (although those kind of players are really used to it/fast with it anyway).\n\nWith all that said, if I could give you any advice i'd say: learn to be accurate with your clicks, and obviously use attack move click (not attack move), but dont use it as a crutch for innaccurate clicks. Learn mouse control/movement. Also you can bind \"left click\" to attack move click, and \"A\" to target champions only. Once you have mastered and gotten used to all these three things (accurate/fast clicks, attack move click and target champions only), you have all the tools that you need to succeed. But dont expect that this will randomly make you higher elo or anything (compared to someone with \"inferior settings\", because as I said, its mostly preference, and people can get used to, and play good (even with bad settings). Like gumayusi not using attack move click, the mid laner version of that is not using quick cast but people that are really good/fast with normal cast are effectively as fast as ppl that quick cast.",

But what if you want to keep hitting the same champ that isnt closest to you and is stacked on top of his teammates. Attack move adds a layer of rng that you cant really control because enemy champs move unpredictably. So you use A+click to stay on the same champ the entire time so you dont reset your silver bolts. \n\nIts kinda hard to describe good examples of why A+click is more accurate but im sure you get what i mean. It just gives you more agency over your champs behavior. And at some point you get so used to it that theres really no speed difference.",

            "comment": "A+click has a couple of advantages over simply right clicking. Firstly, it shows your attack range which allows you to better kite your opponents and play at max range. Using A+click on most ADCs is common so you know exactly when you are in range to fight. This is easier than constantly holding down C as it is bound to the movement you are about to perform. \n\nA+click is also a way to prevent errors by giving explicit commands to the game. Where your right click can be used to attack or move, A+click will primarily attack and only if enemies are not in range will it move. This means that if you A+click beside an opponent (did not click them) your champ will still auto them whereas if you right click beside them you will just walk toward them which may be fatal. \n\nLastly, and somewhat tied to the previous point, it allows you to preposition your mouse to dodge skillshots and maneuver around enemies. Since A+click can be set to attack the closest enemy to your cursor, using it allows you to be walking away from your opponent while simultaneously A+clicking to kite them. You do not need to flick your mouse back and forth between running away and attacking the opponent. You can A+click a Malphite and have your mouse already in position to flash his ult, etc.\n\nI can comfortably kite at 4.0 attack speed with A+click so unless you are going above that I doubt the added inputs make a significant difference.",

            "comment": "Attack move lets you kite with extremely fast attack speed. Picture this. You're a Kogmaw with 2.5 attack speed and Lethal Tempo. You're running from a Mundo who is out for blood. He's gonna take 20 hits to kill, but if he gets onto your face, you die.\n\nWith regular move and attack clicks, you have to rapidly flick the cursor back and forth between Mundo and where you are running (presumably on the opposite sides of the screen). This is just not possible with any semblance of accuracy, in fact in your haste to do it you may likely click *beside* Mundo and thereby walk *towards* him.\n\nWith attack move, the game will register an attack on the nearest enemy to your cursor that is within range, and THEN if none exist, walk in that direction. So, you can keep the cursor pointed *away* from Mundo, in the direction you're running, and alternate attack and regular moves, A, click, click, A, click, click all without needing to move your cursor at all. This is considerably faster AND will therefore let you run away between each attack. Because it's so quick it'll also lets you make your animation cancels more precise.\n\nAttack move is also handy for farming if you can't afford to misclick and walk towards the wave (Lux, idk). But it's not without its own problems (accidentally attacking the wrong target as you run).",

For example on Ezreal I never normal cast Q, but if I haven't played the champ in a while and don't feel confident about the range and width, I spam shift+Q(cancel afterwards, don't fire) in between autos or whenever there is down time until I feel comfortable again.\n\nEdit: Just thought of a situation where I might normal cast. Whenever the opponent is running away and I have a CC or skill shot that might kill them. For whatever reason Blitz and Anivia Qs feel easier to hit whenever I normal cast and don't have to fear retaliation.",

Attack love on click I hit space next to the guy and I\u2019ll auto ur face \ud83d\ude02 doesn\u2019t work when I turn target champions only on and dive (but that\u2019s an A click bug I think?

Zeri can easily 2v5 while being nearly immortal and having some of the best mobility in the entire game. \n\nTeams could claim credit for being good at playing Kai'sa, just because of the coordinated effort it took to make her truly broken. No player deserves praise for \"being good\" at Zeri.",

Tier2 would be challengers, 2nd leagues or the regional leagues in EU.\n\nSource: https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Pentakills/2023\n\nSo long story short, its only a few compared to Zeris 35. Aphelios' Penta number (pentas/year) is still inflated due to release Aphelios before Flamethrower R got nerfed. Which is why his pentas have a bad rep.",

    "postText": "Hey y'all.\n\nI'm back with another graph displaying every champ sorted by the average number of days in between each skin release. Basically speaking, the further down this graph, the more deprived of skins a champion is relative to how long they've been out.\n\n[https://imgur.com/teVU6rL](https://imgur.com/teVU6rL)\n\nThanks to u/Cocoduf for suggesting to color code the bars by year of release.\n\nThis graph is updated to patch 13.12. Five champions received skins on this patch, and I've added arrows showing how their position on the graph has changed due to the release of those skins.\n\nENORMOUS position change for Lillia who, by simply receiving one skin, moved from very near the bottom of the graph to much closer to the top. Also lots of nice gains for relatively deprived champs.",

On top of this, the gap between $hitaphine &amp; the next champ after, Senna, is nearly 2 entire months.  There isn't another disconnect that large on the whole chart.\n\nPS: the numbers are only going to get more sickening once the Sailor Scout skin drops.",

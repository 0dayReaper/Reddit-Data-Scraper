Just making the bot retake the captcha would be enough to complicate things for the botmakers by a lot. Also a system like this should fail the moment it put even a single captcha in front of a human player, since the patterns these bot accounts show are very distinct\n\nAlso the captchas could stop after lvl 30 because if a bot makes it there the system has failed anyway",

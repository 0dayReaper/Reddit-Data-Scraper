    "postText": "Maybe they already answered and probably i'm missing something but:\n\nLet's say everyone gets a 2 rank reset, the d4 guy is now emerald 2, and the p1 is p3.\n\nI know it evens out in the long term, you should be able to climb really fast since you are playing against p1 players in an elo which now belongs to g1 players, but still it feels odd,  especially if you don't play too many rankeds.\n\nwhat do you guys think?\n\nEDIT: the general opinion is that as platinum, you will be reset into emerald (which is what make sense), as gold into plat etc. as the distrubution graph has shown.\n\nI thought the graph was the situation after the ladder evens out, not the situation directly after the reset. And I belive something like \"we are resetting all of you into an higher rank\"(visually) should be said a bit more clrearly but maybe it's just me.\n\nThanks all.",

Some d4 dude barely avoiding platinum? Is gonna be the pinnacle of Emerald. \n\nWhich is honestly the best part of emeralds existence. It might make these players actually try to improve again rather than just saying \"eh I'm diamond, and I don't wanna no life for masters\" and then just autopilotting.",

That's 50% of the player base has the potential to do so all the time.\n\nAnd mate? You ignored my most important point. Emerald is NOT higher rank than platinum. It IS platinum rank. \n\nCurrent platinum rank is the top 15%-top 3% roughly. Emerald is gonna be top 20%-top 1%... so going from plat 4 (top 15%) to say Emerald 4 (top 20%)\n\n**IS GOING DOWN IN RANK**\n\nYou keep saying \"its unprecedented, and they don't say it in the video\"\n\nIt's unprecedented because they don't normally add entire ranks to the game. Unless last time they did were iron and grandmaster which are at the extremes of the ladder. This is the 1st time theyre adding a tier in the middle. Yes it's unprecedented the entire situation is.\n\nThey don't say it in the video? Because they don't wanna admit they're inflating visual ranks for the masses. Your average silver friend will just suddenly be gold because new gold, is the old silver. Platinum will be what gold was. And emerald will be what platinum was.

If today you are at 2k mmr, you will be playing against other people with 2k mmr. Exactly the same people you are playing against now.\n\nAnd if you visible rank, which again, has no impact on matchmaking, is below what it should be according to your mmr, you will have masssively inflated lp gains. It already works that way.",

Imagine if they changed each tier to have eight divisions instead of four: you could say that you went from \"Plat 3\" to \"Plat 6\", but there would still be exactly as many people between you and diamond. \n\nIf you take it to the absurd extreme, imagine if they made each division an individual player. Yeah, you're now in \"Plat 58,955\", and need 58,955 divisions before Diamond, whereas before you were in \"Plat 3\" and only needed two divisions until you hit Diamond. But it's not that 1 division = 1 game or even X divisions = Y games; it's just a different way of bracketing the players.\n\nThey're not changing where the brackets are around Diamond+, they're just changing the brackets in Iron-Platinum. The overall order and MMR/ladder position of players will be untouched.",

It aims to boost the lower tiers up a division (most likely to give a wide portion of the player base a false sense of achievement) silver1 will become plat4 in the new system gold will be spread between plat 3 and emerald 4 bronze 1 becomes gold 4 etc etc. Some posted an extremely useful graph a few days ago that gives an excellent visual representation of the new system I highly recommend checking it out.",

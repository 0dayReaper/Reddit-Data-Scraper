    "postText": "This is kinda annoying. I get that point of reporting is to get them actually muted, but for this match I'd still like to see what they type. Every time I report someone I make sure to unmute them as fast as possible so I don't miss something. Also, a question: Do they 100% get reported after game when I report them inside the game? Cause after the game I can report them again, so I always do it because I'm not sure if it works.",

So I wouldn't worry too much if you already reported them for verbal abuse. As for whether or not in game reports carry the same weight as post game reports I'm not sure.",

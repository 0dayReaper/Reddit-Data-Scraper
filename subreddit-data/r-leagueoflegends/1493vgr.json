Edit : yeah it was against EDG\n\nThe Faker shockwave game, T1 vs EDG worlds 2017, probably greatest comeback in Worlds history should be there since no one predicted that swing after one teamfight with 10k gold down (no objective bounty back then)\n\nTES vs GAM 2022, the infamous JKL bug game, that one was pretty intense for me\n\nHonorable mention is T1 vs DRX game 5 Worlds 2022 purely because the Deft vs Faker storyline, it was intense with several varus baron steal until T1's failed backdoor",

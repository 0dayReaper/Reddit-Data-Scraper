What this will just do is break her core kit completely requiring riot to double her heal and shield size because her kit does not work without sitting on a player. \n\nIt isn't the easy solution. If you want to gut her just cut her stats in half and that's it.",

Morde is the only thing I know besides death that can remove her. If her champ gets cc'd, then she gets knocked off. She's not cc,d and she's free to hop back onto someone after .5 to 1 second. That alone would make her so much less annoying.",

Her anchor getting CC'd would mean Yuumi dies. And their are much easier ways to make gut Yuumi than that.",

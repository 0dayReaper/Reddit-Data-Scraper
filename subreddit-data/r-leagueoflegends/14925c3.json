It\u2019s almost like lethality but for mages. \n\nUnless you\u2019re into a ton of tanks, why would a mage with burst damage want max health damage from the likes of things like liandrys or demonic. \n\nA burst mage is there to dish out huge damage to the backline, similar to an assassin. Shadowflame simply is just the best for this. Also, Horizon Focus is super buggy and glitchy, so people avoid it. Meaning shadowflame is just the best 2nd item.\n\nPretty sure mages and their items kinda just suck rn.",

But, Vlad also scales AP in a unique way on his passive, also his charged q has a huge 110% (I think) ratio. I think if you want to optimize him there's 2 different ways. \n\nThe first would be Proto belt, cosmic, death cap, void. That gives you pen, AP, and AH. I also personally like proto belt more than night harvester because you choose when to use your additional AP ratio. Sometimes with night harvester if you trade in lane right before a fight your burst is a little strange, especially cause so many of Vlad's lane opponent's have sustain (which would mean proccing harvester in lane for them to sustain it back before a fight makes that passive useless), also cosmic should be enough AH, especially if you take any in runes \n\nI think the next build would be to just build more bruiser. Probably Riftmaker, cosmic, death cap, demonic, void. Yes you won't have pen till really late, but this build also makes it where you just out sustain and beat the crap out of people, the Omni vamp is also absurd and you can split push against basically anything.",

Shadowflame is more damage\n- Shadowflame has a better build path which creates better tempo for the person building it. Hextech Alternator is really really good. Needlessly Large Rod may be expensive, but sitting on a Blighted Jewel early game SUCKS.\n\n- Void Staff doesn't help as much with waveclear, clearing waves fast also helps with tempo. Imagine playing Ahri and losing the ability to clear waves quickly because you built void staff for SLIGHTLY more damage on targets you shouldn't be hitting anyways?\n\n- Almost every AP champ has some AP ratios that don't benefit from magic pen. Some notable examples: Annie, Lux, Vex, and Zoe. If any of these champs built void staff early they'd be losing crucial shielding, healing, or true damage. Don't even get me started on AP melee champs like Sylas who rely on flat AP to have any ability to survive trades.\n- Shadowflame has 200 HP which is more impactful early to mid game. Combine this with my previous point and you'll just get statchecked. Ironic\n- You might consider this a stretch, but I'd like to believe League of Legends revolves around the ADC. Doing as much damage as possible to the role with infinite resource attacks is really important. I did the math and you'll do slightly more damage to champs below 60 MR, most ADCs don't even hit 50 until level 17 naturally. If I lose 150 damage vs tanks but gain 75 damage on their ADC, I think I'd take that.",

(35AP means 100-120 potential bonus Magicdmg output for majority of mages that void staff won't give you) And Not to mention that you don't gain any HP at all with voidstaff compared to Shadowflame, which can make the difference between killing and dying aswell, or killing and living through it. Void staff is a good item vs tanks, or players that actively buy MR but not vs enemys that only have their base MR as their only defense against you",

            "comment": "Assassin / burst mage player here.\n\nSure Void Staff is better for tanks, but why would I use my long-cooldown abilities on the 4000 HP tank who isn't dealing much damage to my team?\n\nEven with true damage, I might not kill him with one rotation. And regardless of whether I do, my spells will be on cooldown when the high-damage enemies step forward.\n\nIn contrast, Shadowflame lets me get to the backline and kill high-damage targets before they're a threat to my team. A lot of times you come out the other side of that with less than 200 hp. Even if you die, it might have bought you enough time to secure a crucial kill.\n\nTo reiterate, my ADC melts tanks. Their class has higher sustained DPS. Their weakness is burst mages / assassins.  So if I take care of the enemy burst mages / assassins then my ADC can do their job of cleaning up the tanks.",

The item spike is also achieved earlier. \n\nOn the other hand there have also been cases where people widely bought it when it was suboptimal - I've seen the item have &lt;10 passive damage dealt after 10 minutes because of having too much magic pen. There are cases where (again, due to too much magic pen) the item is simply worse than Horizon Focus but Shadowflame is *perceived* as good while Horizon Focus is seen as bad. And lastly, you've got Cosmic Drive that's another great item but it's fully overlooked and since it gives different stats than Shadowflame, you can't simply math it out to see when it's better or worse than Shadowflame (unlike Horizon Focus). \n\nSo, mostly, Shadowflame is great and that's why it's built that often. But it's also sometimes built when it shouldn't be.",

It provides a super strong spike, but doesn\u2019t provide that many defensive stats.\n\nI\u2019ve found that if you have a dark seal stacked up, you can actually justify something like Zhonyas to keep the snowball going. You will be doing significantly less damage but Dark Seal provides enough damage to get you to kill in one rotation anyways.\n\nIf you are equal or behind, Shadowflame is *usually* the best choice as a second item to provide the damage to start killing in 1-2 rotations.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s moreso for your item curve than anything else. Rabadons has expensive components and an expensive combine cost, while Shadowflame has better components (though you still need a large rod) for similar damage output and 600 less gold all together. Sure if you look at your final build you\u2019d rather have a Deathcap in that slot, but you can\u2019t always play for the exact best items.\n\nYou also have to think about what happens when you get Deathcap second. Your next best damage item is Void, then what? Most items just wont give you a good powerspike in damage, especially since Shadowflame will most likely have much less value at that point. Whereas if you get Shadowflame second, your third and fourth item purchases are also huge spikes to your damage, again, of course you could\u2019ve gotten Deathcap and Void sooner but you don\u2019t get many better item purchases after you complete those.",

For deathcap and void staff you need to have some ap already, so buying them as second item is not good. Meanwhile other items give significantly lower damage and instead offer utility, majority of which is not impactful enough anyways.",

    "postText": "As a huge fan of the pre-rework Mundo in early league I was very excited to see how riot could bring him into modern league and to my surprise riot delivered a fantastic rework, on par with the likes of fiddlesticks and Volibear. The new appearance, abilities, and voice lines were top notch with corporate Mundo by far taking the cake as what I think is the best skin in league. He was good too, simple to play but still had a high skill ceiling since he wasn\u2019t like traditional tanks or bruisers with cc but rather the opposite, cc immunity. I will admit some nerfs were needed, the high base ad and early damage with his Q made him hard to fight but over 3 nerfs later he started to feel average and then\u2026\u2026.the major adjustment came and it killed a huge portion of power the Mundo rework had. Passive now has no regen early, his base ad is terrible, his W costs 8% current health and is only useful for the first .75 seconds after it\u2019s cast and had its duration shortened. His E was improved but does not scale well until late game and worst of all Riot thinks giving him bonuses health regen in ult at rank 3 makes up for the terrible early game and mediocre mid game. The Mundo rework was fantastic and yet has made him sooo much worse for what feels like no reason when they had it right to begin with. It\u2019s just sucks since the aesthetic and new coat of paint are fantastic but the gameplay really has fallen off a cliff.",

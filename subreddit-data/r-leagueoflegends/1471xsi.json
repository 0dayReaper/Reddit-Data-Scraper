Then they could do a max per 3 games or something for regular season. So if you picked Zeri week 1 you couldn't again until week 4. Then in champion select there is a section that shows ineligible champs near banned champs.\n\nYeah, a game with 150+ champs should encourage a very large portion of those to be played in pro play. Having some additional rules to force players to go deeper into the pool would facilitate this.\n\nIt could be especially cool during best of 5s though. Like if your team is winning almost every game they have Zeri in then you've gotta decide which game/draft state you want to bring that champ out in.\n\nEdit: Just thought some more on this. If you went with this type of approach then after Zeri is picked the next game would have bans targeting Lucian and Aphelios for example, pinching things a bit more. Then after Xayah is picked the following game we'd see a different ADC again. So this should bring in 6-8 viable ADCs at least, instead of constantly seeing the same 2-3.",

While there were periods where he was grossly overpowered such as with Runeglaive, Death's Dance, Kleptomancy and the like, bare in mind that this is mostly due to the interaction with said items or runes (for Klepto's case) and not with the design of the champion itself. \n\nEzreal **abuses items specifically** but he isn't exactly broken himself because for all intents and purposes, his kit is very tame, even underwhelming in some cases when you look at the current state of modern champion design.\n\nZeri is essentially what happens when you give Ezreal both scaling and raw DPS on top of both good range and mobility.",

No amount of reworks or changes can fix that, and conversations about it can't go anywhere / don't add up, because Riot will never acknowledge it.

Leauge tries to avoid *hard* counters. DotA dosen't. So even a weak hero can suddenly be a great pick against the right enemy.\n\nJust as an example off the top of my head [I'm no DotA expert], Medusa is a hypercarry. She's pretty weak eartlygame but between Split Shot and her massive lategame durability with Mana Shield [she can direct damage to her mana] she's a terror lategame. Mana Shield absorbs *98%* of damage and it's not even a 1:1 ratio. It's up to 4.9 damage per mana with a talent. Medusa however has THE lowest HP pool in the game, with literally 0 Strength naturally.\n\nThere is a hero called Lion; who is generally played as a Support. He has a unit-targeted stun as well as a polymorph totaling 5.4 seconds of C.C on a single target; and an ability called Mana Drain. Mana Drain; as the name implies; drains mana per second.\n\nDue to how Medusa works; this drain [up to 150 per second] is effectively up to 735 DPS against Medusa.\n\nLion's Ultimate is also a *massive* nuke. The base damage of Lion's lv1 ultimate is actually enough to oneshot a lv30 Medusa's entire HP pool; assuming she has no addittional HP.\n\nSo you can pick Lion into Medusa; and she just... can't farm against Lion. If she tries Lion will stunlock her; drain her mana, and then her abysmal HP pool will result in either Lion's carry killing her with ease; or Lion will just Ult Medusa and oneshot her.\n\nNow of course Medusa can get items to mitigate this; but Medusa needs *gold* to get things like that. And it's a bit hard getting gold if Lion just ruins your day as soon as he sees you. Especially when death loses you gold in DotA, and Medusa has 0 mobility at all.\n\nOh; and every time Finger of Death oneshots Medusa; *it gets stronger*. And a farmed Lion can get an aghs to make Finger hit an AoE and have a 20 second cooldown; and has a talent which also makes every Finger kill give HP too. Medusa cannot run away from Lion either; Lion has a higher movespeed.\n\nBasically; you *really* don't want to fight a Lion as Medusa.",

Each hero has at least one mechanic and niche that only THEY can provide, uniquely and individually. For example, even when Medusa is bad, her mana shield provides her a level of tankiness that no hero can match. Even when Jakiro is bad, his aoe stun and ability to reduce tower attack speed is special and means he can be picked if it's a good situation for that, or if there's a draft that needs that.

Someone more invested can come up with an analogy that fits it, but my point is they do not understand what they're doing and have made too many huge changes in a short time period to the point they're behind on fixing the core issues and just patching champions. We all know the rune system is to blame to some extent for why certain champs are so powerful, but the champs being discussed in this thread are purely design issues.

They're already removing Zeri's shield-stealing, next they need to get rid of some of K'Sante's CC, one of Nilah's passives (preferably the Q passive, or just nerf it) and some of the true damage of Bel'Veth's kit and I think all those champs would be in more balanced spots.\n\nIt makes me worried that Naafiri is going to be a balance nightmare since she's being marketed as an easy-to-play assassin, then they go and give her a a ability that swaps and enemy's AD and AP stats or something",

Add to that the fact that LCK gameplay is often farm 20mins  then do one teamfight and then the game is over. It's so boring that it literally makes me sleep since I watch lying on my bed and watching on my phone.",

They\u2019re already getting it on PBE, on top of zeri loosing literally an entire ability. I don\u2019t think a champion has straight up lost their entire passive before. So why complain when a solution is already in the works?",

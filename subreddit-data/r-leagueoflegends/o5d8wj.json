It has these little mini games throughout that are equal parts fun and frustrating. Overall it\u2019s a great concept for a warm up game or if you want to dick around without actually playing a full game of League, but needs some serious polish if they wanted to keep long term.",

Yes your kda won\u2019t look good, but if you don\u2019t initiate, you will just lose if you keep getting poked out/ enemy takes turret plates. If you miss an E and think you have the better 2 v2, just flash in instead, people save flashes to get out of fights but as Leona you want to be right in the middle of all the action, living after is just a bonus, and you usually do survive in a 2 v 2 anyways",

Because that's not what her purpuse is.\nShe can't cc people when she's dead.\n\nShe can't soak up any more damage when she's dead.\n\nMy take on soloq is the balance between you don't wanna die Nad you wanna learn as much as possible for the next games which includes limit testing. And good limit tests can involve dying.\nYou have to learn the game which could even include inting.\nIf you learn the right things and apply them in the next games you will long term die less.

If the enemy groups on me i can 2v1 on yi if im fed and they can force midlane if they see me get grouped on. \n\nSo in this case they have 2 clear instructions the can fulfill. Most players get caught cause they lack direction and are not good enough at the game to give themself instructions. \n\nSame for baron, if i see 2 people botlane from the enemies, i tell them to rush baron and if the 3 enemies top side come contest we turn on them immediatly and stop baron to not get it stolen. So everyone is on the same page from the start.\n\nOr telling your support to hold their onclick cc for the enemy fed assassin no matter what. You need to tell them that their most important job is ccing the enemy fed assassin and that they should hold their ability just for them. Give them a small task they can focus. \n\nIf you manage your team this way winning gets so much easier.\n\nYou need to write a lot sadly, cause there is no voice chat, but it is so effective. Sometimes people dont listen, but generally people are thankful for directions, as they themself have no clue.",

Believe me you got to play for the people that are fed or fill your role.  I have won more games after inting then I have lost count because I peel properly for adc or mitigate the enemy fed top laner Long enough for my allies to win.  It\u2019s not hard but people don\u2019t understand it or don\u2019t want to win a game where they got carried.  It\u2019s called playing for your win condition.  Majority of games you won\u2019t be this giga fed player.",

Always compare their KDA, but in the end, they stand behind (as a jungler, or a top laner or a tank sp) and wait for you to engage as a enchant sp or adc or a mid laner, if not they just blame you 24/7. Imagine what is going on in their brain!!!\n\nMe (solo queue) : Meh, They don't deserve the win, I'm fine losing anyway\n\nAlso me : Happily eating pop corn, and watch how they teach me to engage as an adc or mid laner or a enchant support, while the KDA player (jungler, top laner or tank sp sits behind wait me die and waiting for that juicy clean up) But if I see some mistake I will engage but if they took my kills, I will just sit behind and watch how our towers and objective getting destroyed 1 by 1 and smiling at defeat muhahahahaha I'm so evil sometimes ;V",

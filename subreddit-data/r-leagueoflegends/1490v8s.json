Her 2v2 or 3v3 when laning phase is still going on is abysmal even after 6 so when she gets counterganked, which in high elo junglers know how to do, she will just put her and her laners behind.\n\ntl;dr she is just super unreliable with how her current state and kit is. in lower elo's this is punished much less because people make alot more mistakes themselves and dont know how to deal with her.",

In shyvana\u2019s case however, I think she could use a rework as even in low elo her kit is not ideal. Amumu is an example of a low elo skewed champ but he has a good kit and can be used in high elo in situations because of his good cc and tankiness. Shyv doesn\u2019t have anything like that, basically just a farm machine until 6 and then she nukes people with her E.",

Some popular champions skew that number hard though. \n\nI think the same point applies though, 1k is far less but only her mains are on her. As one of those players I can tell you anecdotally Shyvana is not fun in high elo. Playing j4 amumu or almost any other champ is just 10x easier even though shyvana is the \"easy\" champ.",

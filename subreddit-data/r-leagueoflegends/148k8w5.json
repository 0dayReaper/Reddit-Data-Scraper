    "postText": "With the removal of Prowlers claw, Riot felt the need to buff RekSai and Renekton as the item was the core item for these 2 champs.\n\nRekSai in particular got a big buff, too big imo. The champion is completely broken and game-ruining right now with how op she is. Let me present to you the win rate, pick rate and ban rate data from 3 different data sites as Phreak himself complained about people using LoLalytics because the win rates are inflated on that site in his livestream (I asked how is she not getting a nerf in her current state, I can go back and clip it if people would like!)\n\nU GG Data:Plat+: 53% win rate with a decent pick rate and decent ban rate\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8766stsrct5b1.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bb4de0e9a8a4b4e74ee21b2e7a8519a02301cfcf\n\nMasters+: Nearly a 55% win rate with a even higher pick rate\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/374w3r7zct5b1.png?width=1225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=612e0e8202bf6025c723159ca96fee292e41e905\n\nNow lets move on to LoLalytics.Plat+: Almost a 55% win rate in 'lower' elo.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umpripp5dt5b1.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a99aac07aa9258d7be9adf3091ecf307d5f66cdd\n\nMasters+: A WHOPPING borderline 59% win rate. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/464v5hoadt5b1.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aba5c6751f764fa3a3fc2b9a99e2d259360ea454\n\n[Data for Top RekSai mains for last 7 days](https://preview.redd.it/rlb4atxbet5b1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=14c5dd14e960164b547707dc57d2c7f70fd97f85)\n\nNow for OP GGPlat+: Over a 53% win rate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/evrlctshdt5b1.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=961df7fcae145587f749a921c0bfc94217c5c532\n\nMasters+: A 55% win rate\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nsdsoyzkdt5b1.png?width=873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a9d5023715dfa8cf2f5a3571f4fb370d2de39748\n\nIt is mind boggling to me as I see she is not being talked about right now (as far as I have seen) and every game in my games she completely takes over and demolishes the game. She was not on the 13.12 preview either.\n\nPhreak said in his stream that LoLalytics was inflating her winrate with the '1,000 games' played my master tier players. Clearly it is not as the other 2 big data sites (which are more normalized win rates, phreak says himself) show she is statistically overperforming.\n\nHe then later goes on to say RekSai MIGHT be op and says essentially, \"oh well, we might see her in a few games of pro play, so be it\" basically admitting they are allowing a champ to be giga-broken as long as a 'few games of it' are picked in pro once the pros catch up patch wise. Quite interesting words from a gameplay balance designer. This is the 2nd twitch clip linked below.\n\nIt also feels champions are allowed to be broken for way too long, especially this season. Zeri? Gragas? RekSai (with nothing in current patch, at LEAST another 2 weeks of it.) Kindred? (Kindred is also a champion that is extremely strong right now due to the hotfix buffs she got, I do not know why the Riot balance team does not let changes settle before hotfixing).\n\nI decided to go back and clip those from the stream and will put the timestamp as to when this gets talked about.\n\n[https://clips.twitch.tv/QuaintTentativeMelonPastaThat-ZZEbTjuEc3ffxFn-](https://clips.twitch.tv/QuaintTentativeMelonPastaThat-ZZEbTjuEc3ffxFn-)[https://clips.twitch.tv/AbstruseThankfulPandaGrammarKing-BYrzB9sppzQQfmJZ](https://clips.twitch.tv/AbstruseThankfulPandaGrammarKing-BYrzB9sppzQQfmJZ)Timestamp: 01:08:50\n\nP. S:This isn't a post to direct any kind of hate or anything towards any person at Riot, simply a discussion.",

She has always been an exclusive high elo menace which majority of ppl arent.\n\nI have to say, i see her often in high elo streamers but almost never in games even though she counters popular champs like Lee K6 Rengar Eve.\n\nI guess she just borrowed under the radar like an UBoat",

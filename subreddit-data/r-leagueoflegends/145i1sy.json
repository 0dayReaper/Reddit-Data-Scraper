                    "comment": "There are several factors that hold Brazil back.\n\n1- ***LoL does not have the biggest playerbase in Brazil.*** As you said, CS and Valorant have more players here, which makes the ranked queues more competitive and that makes it easier to produce good local talent.\n\n***2- Brazil is an isolated region.*** Think about this: Players from Turkey and Eastern Europe can play in the EUW solo queue. Players from Japan, China and Taiwan can play in Korea solo queue and players from LLA can play in NA. Brazil... There is no major region close.\n\n3- ***LoL's competitive circuit format.*** Brazil is already an isolated region... With the current format of the international LoL circuit, Brazilian teams had contact with the international scene for about 2/3 weeks a year (MSI and Worlds). In CS, for example, it is an open circuit and Brazilian teams play against international teams all the time.\n\n4- Brazil has started to develop the teams' infrastructure only recently. In terms of coaching staff, Brazil still behind. There is even a big discussion in the Brazilian community about how it would be better to import coaching staff than players.",

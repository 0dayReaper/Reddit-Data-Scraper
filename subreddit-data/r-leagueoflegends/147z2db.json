Just cool lil stats.\n\nThey give you orange essence for disenchanting them, which means you can use the orange essence to upgrade skin shards into actual skins.  So really it\u2019s either \u201ccool lil stats\u201d or \u201ccosmetic\u201d. \n\nConsidering you\u2019re new, I\u2019d hold onto all of the skins and skin shards until you figure out what champions you really like and really don\u2019t like. Then use them and you\u2019ll probably have a pretty decent amount for getting whatever you want with it.",

Even if you get it for a character you like it's not tracking historical progress, so your 9999 mundo games are ignored.\n\nThe only reason for keeping eternal shards is if you're betting that they will change them in the future. They could increase the value, they could improve the trackers to track previous games, they could make them universal, they could combine eternals into 1 instead of 3 separate series , they could add more SFX , they could tie eternals to other effects and even skins, they could give eternals unique voicelines etc etc",

I am not familiar with K-pop culture and I don\u2019t know what makes it K-pop or if the genre is just appropriated by those other cultures. There are three Koreans on the team, but no one actually performed in Korean. To me, it sounded like an assumption that 4 out of the 5 players were Korean, but that isn\u2019t true. IF that is the case I just feel it\u2019s important and respectful not to assume someone\u2019s background like that because there is a stark difference between being Korean and Chinese for example.",

It mostly evolved into its own genre and character at this point which is what people refer to when they mention \u201ckpop\u201d, not the actual cultural background of the person (for the most part).",

It\u2019s maybe easy to have heard of them but it doesn\u2019t mean that you interact with or are exposed to their music. The internet is vast and at the palm of the user\u2019s hand which means you can basically pick and choose what you want to see, it\u2019s rarely if ever going to randomly come on like it would on the radio or TV. Music as an internet genre itself is crowded with so many artists and different types. I\u2019ve maybe heard a handful of BTS songs but I had no interest so I couldn\u2019t tell you what I\u2019ve listened to let alone what they are up to, member\u2019s names, famous songs, etc. I didn\u2019t even know they did the World Cup song last year until I looked them up because I don\u2019t watch soccer/football either\u2026\n\n\n\nImagine getting flamed for not knowing this specific song being parodied when you don\u2019t even cross over to that side of the internet and you aren\u2019t getting fed \u201cpopular\u201d content but stuff tailored to yourself as an individual. League of Legends is a perfect example, it\u2019s a huge worldwide game, but do you expect everyone to have heard of it let alone seen it or played it? Remember the champs they saw? Fame and popularity is so much different these days compared to 20 plus years ago.",

Last Summer, it seemed like LSB was favorites to be first in the qualifier gauntlet and make it to Worlds, but they lost to Damwon...and then DRX began their Cinderella run, by pulling an upset on LSB and denying Prince from Worlds. Prince was denied again in LCS Spring, when he and FLY got gapped by C9 and then choked out of their minds against GG. I really hope, Prince finally goes to Worlds. he and Fly might not win anything, but hey he will at least break the curse.",

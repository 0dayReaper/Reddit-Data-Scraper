Graves, kindred, even lethality vi are good champs to climb in low elo just because they punish bad positioning from enemies which in lower elo is more apparent. Those champs are good low elo then kinda fall off without more knowledge in like gold-low diamond then get good again in high dia-chally.",

You want to master a champ that has straight forward goals, so when you fail to meet those goals, you\u2019re more likely to understand why and improve for next time.\n\nMundo is simple to pickup but not that simple to be impactful with. Sure, it\u2019s easy and funny to be tanky and run around the teamfight, but a Mundo that\u2019s carrying is totally unstoppable and can 1v5.\n\nPlay what you like, but I think he\u2019s a poor pick for your stated goals.",

Compared to the meta tank junglers, he has worse engage (Maokai, Zac, Amumu, Sejuani). Udyr is the closest comparison and I think Udyr actually starts clearing faster once he starts getting levels in his R.",

Lee sin, Elise, and graves are all nightmares for him.\n\nI say his goals are unclear because many champs have clear priority targets in a teamfight, clear windows of strength, and clear spikes in power.\n\nLike, many junglers have huge spikes in power when they hit 6 and can start spam ganking if they want. Mundo isn\u2019t like that at all. Other junglers scale hard into the mid game and can take over teamfights by then. Mundo MIGHT do that, but you\u2019ll need to carefully cultivate a lead until then.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ll learn the game better with a champ that has nebulous goals, but it\u2019s most common for people to recommend iron and bronze players more one dimensional champs so they get the basics down.",

Great clear speed but weak ganks and is generally stronger Top / outperformed by actual Tank junglers.\n\nA lot of his power is how strong rushing &amp; stacking Heartsteel is for him, and his ability to split as a beefy juggernaut-tank hybrid, which is less effective in the jungle since you get less Heartsteel stacks, are a lower resource role, and want to be grouping for objectives.\n\nI'd honestly recommend someone like Udyr or Maokai as stronger tank Junglers at the moment, though Mundo's playable if you just really love the champ but don't want to take him Top for whatever reason.",

This is aplicable for any champion you're curious if they work or not.  \n\n\nIt will give you a feeling of what the champion looks like in the jungle. Keep in mind low elo is a different beast, so ultimately it's up to you to decide if you can apply pressure in a game like the person does in the video.   \n\n\nOverall, what I can safely say is that yes, Mundo works in the jungle.",

Your goal is to clear quickly, take 1 scuttle and back, then either do 1 camp and rush drake or 3 camp then drake (whenever you have either lane priority or info on the enemy jungler's position). \n\nAs for leveling, put 3 points in Q then max E. Look for ganks only if the enemy laner is pushed in,  but remember that early 2v2s will probably not be at your advantage. Take ghost instead of Flash it'll make your ganks easier if you have opportunities. \n\nRemember that your lv1 ult is quite bad, your goal is to outfarm the enemy jungler and secure most objectives. \n\nSo to sum everything up: get a deep ward to know where the enemy jungler is starting, start at blue then full clear and take scuttle, back, start looking for drakes and perma farm unless you see an obvious ganking opportunity. Jungle tracking is what will ensure that you don't get caught out in the open when you're at your weakest.",

If he picks up some small buffs down the road it could become solid jungle pick though.\n\nHe power farms well and is solid at taking herald/dragon solo but his ganks are quite bad and he is very weak before level 11 and ideally at least two items.\n\nFor iron he should be fine. You just need to survive your team tilting because most players believe the jungler should be simultaneously ganking all three lanes at every second of the game while also getting all the objectives by themselves.",

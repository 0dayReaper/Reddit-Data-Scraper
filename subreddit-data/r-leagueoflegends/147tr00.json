    "postText": "This is the first time i post on reddit and probably also the last. But something today really pissed the fk off me. \n\nI lost a game today because my jungle went 0/4 in first few mins of the game and spammed ff15 since then. Nothing out of ordinary right? yea, im used to that sht. I reported him, I think at least 1 or 2 more guys reported him. Guess what? Next game i have the same jungler and of course he ran it down again. \n\nWhy is it possible to get the same person you just reported for sabotaging the game right in the next game as your team mate? Is riot out of their mind? There have been plenty of issues with the game just like any other complex invention and nobody should be surprised, but this particular issue is simple common sense.",

It would literally  be optimal to report half the lobby every game even if nothing happened even if they didnt break any rules just so you dont queue into them again.\n\nThen what happens in higher elos? If I Was challenger and reported half the people there, who am I going to queue into.",

Riot purposefully puts you in unwinnable games and games you will 100% win. It\u2019s almost never in between, and if it is, it isn\u2019t enough to rank up. It\u2019s how the system keeps you playing. When\u2019s the last time you had fun playing ranked?\n\nStick to aram or uninstall this game. I mean it\u2019s a 1 hour commitment per match based on que and champ select. It\u2019s not a good investment at all. \n\nIf anything you should be thanking the guy who said ff15, because perhaps it was one step closer to you giving up on this game.",

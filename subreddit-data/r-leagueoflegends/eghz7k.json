You still have to factor in timing and distance when using them. Now nearly everything is a skillshot and while yes, that does create more exciting outplay opportunities, it's just not as much fun. I used to main Ezreal/Kennen (way back in season 2) because they were THE 'skillshot champs' and I felt good about being good at them. Nowadays literally anything I pick up has a skillshot and it's just not the same.",

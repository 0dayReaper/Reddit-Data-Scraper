    "postText": "&gt;Zeri, Yuumi are receiving significant nerfs in 13.12. We're not happy with their state in Pro and intend a meta shift away from enchanters (+Milio nerfs)\n\n&gt;Both champs benefited from 13.10, 11\n\n&gt;Zeri is too strong &amp; tanky on Tri Force spike + Yuumi has strong synergy with Helias\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RiotPhroxzon/status/1668706853008863232\n\n\n&gt;Item changes have made both champs overtuned individually, which makes them especially overwhelming together\n\n&gt;We're optimistic about their future and mechanics, BUT think sub 50% WR is a better spot for them to sit long term &amp; are open to more drastic changes if that doesn't work\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RiotPhroxzon/status/1668706854724325376\n\nAbove are the tweets and links to said tweets.\n\nSo it seems like they are receiving big nerfs (as we see also in patch notes).\n\nIt looks like Zeri and Yuumi are planned to now be much worse for solo queue so they don't become too good in pro play.\n\nPersonally, this seems to indicate to me that the Yuumi changes were not successful at all. Wasn't the entire point to have her be playable for casuals without being too strong in pro?\n\nRiot is now straight up saying that they are open to more drastic changes in the future. He says just after Yuumi already received a full rework once. Lol.\n\nI honestly don't know what will happen with these champions anymore. I think it's time for Riot to have a long hard thinking session about how they design their new characters.\n\nWhat do you think?",

And at that point my added safety isn't worth it anymore.\n\nYeah you can also go bruiser Kalista (with Bork Jak'sho and Titanic), but it sucks when it comes to the dmg numbers so you go full glass cannon on hit stuff, because dealing dmg is your job.",

But that feels like shit to have to deal with as the Yuumi player. Basically, there is no way to fix Yuumi for both the player, and those against her, that will ever feel fun so long as she has the attach mechanic. It breaks such a core tenet of the game, interacting with your enemy, that she cannot work.  The attach mechanic is 100% a failed design that needs to be removed.",

If you catch her out or get on top of her, or have some kind of burst damage, she\u2019s dead like any other ADC. I think she\u2019s like Akali where eventually, given more changes and refinement, she will be in an okay place.\n\nYuumi on the other hand is the only champ I can outright say does NOT belong in League. And it amazes me how 4 years on this is still the case. The issue with her is so simple, it\u2019s that she\u2019s an enchanter you can cannot target. The whole counterplay of enchanters is that they are easy to kill and need to position well so they can benefit their allies while being a safe distance. They\u2019re the champs where they will buff and save the fuck out of people but you as an enemy can identify and respect this and kill them before they can turn whoever into a 1v9 machine. Yuumi just straight up ignores all of this by design and has no acceptable counterplay whatsoever. The only way they can make Yuumi fair is by either making her early laning so underpowered that she just loses her ADC the lane by default, or making her abilities incredibly unimpactful. Because if Yuumi does have abilities that are even say, 50% of what a Soraka could do, the impact of those abilities goes up astronomically by the fact that Yuumi physically cannot be killed or removed from her teammate. People say \u2018oh well Yuumi can only heal and buff one person at a time\u2019 but that doesn\u2019t matter because when teams start to group she doesn\u2019t need to buff anyone except the most fed person on the enemy team, even since her rework. Like great, she can only shield the fed Bel\u2019Veth and not the Irelia or Syndra or Kai\u2019Sa at the same time but.. it doesn\u2019t matter that she can\u2019t buff those others because she makes a big threat into a\u2026 mega big threat, idk, but one that you have to deal with. I\u2019ll say what everyone else does, and rightfully, Yuumi is unsalvageable with her current identity and needs a complete rework from the ground up.",

If she doesn't scale with player skill and has little to no execution requirements, then if she has a high win rate in low elo, it will be purely based around her numbers. If her numbers are good, then she will clearly also be effective in high elo play.\n\nThe only way for her to perform better in low elo than high elo is for her game plan or kit to have a flaw that can be abused specifically in high elo, but that seems hard to build in to a champion that is built to be non-interactive.",

Imo pickrate doesn't indicate how good the champ is as some champs are popular even when they are garbage and the same is true for banrate. Zed was the most banned champ in some periods but i wouldn't call him overpowered, or more powerful than the rest of the assasin roster",

An unfair shortcut pretty much.\nIf Yuumi is absolute garbage tier, then people are less likely to say to their friend/gf/whatever \"come play with me you can just pick the cat stick to me and you'll have fun\". She is meant as a gateway drug to League to get new potential addicts hooked, and hopefully they buy a couple skins.\n\nSuch a shortcut champ is completely unfair to the current playerbase but Riot has KPIs like \"influx of new player\" to improve so yeah sorry not sorry! Same reason getting rid of smurfs and bought accounts is simply never happening, it pumps the KPIs. 0 fucks (and respect) given to the players.",

I think they should have removed the move speed alone, if they felt they absolutely needed to hit her passive.

He's literally the perfect top laner with all the tools he could need. He can build full tank and isolate a carry and kill them with ease, while being hyper mobile, having shields, choosing when he wants to trade his tankiness for damage, it's completely bogus. He was hype to watch in pro when he released but it quickly became apparent that no other toplaners can provide the amount of tools he does. Competely overtuned. Hard to watch at this point.",

Abathur didn\u2019t lane\u2014he just manipulated things remotely and sat in base, causing teammates to be down a traditional body for objectives or team fights, with Abathur playing his own version of the game.\n\nYuumi isn\u2019t as bad, but she still forces the whole lobby to play a different version of League. Her ADC is forced to be the only target in lane, forcing the ADC to position better until 6. The allied jungle has less help tanking until 6. The enemy jungle has a harder time ganking or the best time ganking, depending on how the ADC plays. Same with the enemy botlane\u2014free double kills or they get one at all since Yuumi healing is insane and the slippery is so high.\n\nThe fact that Yuumi can just be completely uninteractable and untargetable permanently by ALL members of the lobby while she is attached is just insane. It\u2019s antithetical to the core gameplay. \n\nRiot\u2019s defense that \u201cYuumi is great for new players\u201d is also complete BS because Yuumi doesn\u2019t teach you how to play League\u2014you don\u2019t learn moving, backing, positioning\u2014none of that.\n\nSo \u201cnot being able to be hit while practicing skill shots\u201d or whatever is idiotic, because all other champions need to worry about movement, period. I\u2019m pretty sure anyone who has played any video game ever understands that you need to aim your abilities lol.\n\nThen on the flip side, the pro player impact is insane too. Yuumi has been proven to be toxic as hell\u2014always banned, and anytime not banned, always picked.\n\nPretty sure Riot shared criteria awhile back for \u201cgood\u201d Champion design that covered counterplay, balance, skill expression, casual play, and pro play-and Yuumi just fails all of those factors.\n\nShe isn\u2019t good for new or casual players. She isn\u2019t good for the pro scene. She offers no counterplay or skill expression\u2014she\u2019s untargetable with zero interaction. She can be a toxically powerful enchanter while ALSO dealing top damage in teamfights\u2026while being again, untargetable\u2026so basically no downside.\n\nOne final point is how Yuumi is the prime target for botting. Like she is perfect for bots. Yet another reason to stack on top why here current decision is giga trash and toxic.\n\nIt\u2019s insane. I have no idea how Yuumi hasn\u2019t been on the chopping block, either for an Aatrox style redesign gutting or just removal entirely.\n\nAlready too long of a comment, but Zeri also falls into a lot of what I said above. No real weaknesses or downside\u2014can be tanky, mobile, and a damage dealer all in one. Plays very differently from other ADCs to the point it feels like she doesn\u2019t fit in the game/is playing another game, etc. The amount of dev time spent on Zeri and Yuumi is insane.",

Hots Maps differed in size, but often were eithr smaller, or easier to move around due to mounting, vs in League. That means if someone saw Aba on the map, they could move to hunt the Aba. Aba also would need to move out of base to get max value from the Locust he spawned to help push waves since they only last so long. That means an Aba would be extremely vulnerable to gankers like Genji or Tracer. Yummi suffers no such fate. Top laners won't be moving to kill a Yummi because the top lane is too far from anyone else, especially bot. Along with that, Yummi sits on another player and is immue, always giving bonuses to that person until they die. Then, most of the time, Yummi will die after getting through about two life bars of whoever she is sitting on. Yummi as a concept is a lot more toxic of a design since there really is not counter to her being immune, vs Aba losing value if he doesn't move from base.",

All this work they're doing is good work thrown after bad, they might be able to get them into a place where the numbers kinda work but at the end of the day, this is causing frustration for both the players who play Yuumi/Zeri, and the ones who play against her.\n\nBut I guess Riot made a lot of money off their skins so, net win for them at least.

We're going to continue to balance her out of Pro and Elite play. \n\nHaving said that, the main point I wanted to make a clarification about is that the 1-30 experience is different from the average player (~mid silver) experience. \n\nDespite being sub50 for average players on paper, if you account for her steep mastery curve, she sports very reasonable performance metrics. A lot of this is due to how different she is to other champions for a player who's played thousands of hours of league, so she has quite a different playstyle (similar to singed in that respect) and tanks a lot of winrate on games 1-5. \n\nHaving a steep mastery curve for the average player doesn't mean that's the case for a completely new player though. The reason why we tried to design around the attach is because she is far and away the best champ to play with a completely new friend to learn the very basics of the game, like how to kill people, use your abilities, win the game, etc. (1-10 especially, but 10-30 also). After that, people can choose to stick with her or play a more traditional champion. She has a 5% higher winrate than the number 2 champion, while being in the top 5 pick rate for this player bracket, despite her previously expensive cost (6300). \n\nIt may turn out that she can't even live sub50 without causing problems, in which case, we have some tough decisions to make. But that's our hope at least. \n\nAt a minimum we're going to listen and make whatever changes we think are necessary to get her into a good state, but thought this piece of info would be useful for the discussion.",

I won't even say that you're lying, I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt that you're being completely honest when you say this, but it's so utterly out of touch with reality. MILLIONS of people learned this game before this champion ever existed. And how exactly does she teach even half of what you said? Learning how to kill people? But she doesn't kill anyone, the person that she's attached to does all the killing. Literally the only thing Yuumi teaches a new player is how to press buttons. That's it. In the meantime it teaches a bunch of bad habits as if the player jumps off that character they now have to worry about a bunch of other things such as positioning that the character taught them absolutely nothing about.\n\nI feel like this argument from Riot is super disingenuous. Yuumi does not attract new players, Yuumi attracts players *who don't want to improve at the game*. And I really really hate this intellectually dishonest, tacit argument that her attach mechanic is somehow NECESSARY for new players to have access to. How can you possibly assert something like this when the game has literally existed for over a decade?",

They do small slow tweaks to try and bring the game to a balanced state. They know that sometimes it takes a long time for creative players and coaches to find the tools to counter strategies that seem overpowered. The meta game is determined by player culture and strategy and can change without a patch. \n\nLoL doesn't do that. They expect the game to be in constant flux. They expect there to always be weak options and strong options at any given time. The meta game is determined by what has been recently buffed and changes with new patches. \n\nSo this is right on brand for Riot. They will keep making changes forever. It's their design philosophy. They don't really care if there's a final balanced state for Yuumi or Zeri. They only care that they don't dominate pro play for an extended period of time because that makes the game look bad.\n\nI dislike it.

Movement speed is one of the most brutally overpowered stats in the game (the reason why Hecarim breaks the game every preseason, has to be butchered every year and slowly rebuffed until he tips over again), especially on a ranged champion. For Yuumi, we can see how toxic of a game mechanic untargetability is when Fizz or Duskblade does it. Except Yuumi is almost permanently untargetable. \n\nThe people designing these champions messed up, it happens. Just stop being so stubborn about it and admit it. Not every champion is going to be amazingly designed, but at the very least they should be reasonable to a certain extent, which Zeri and Yuumi aren't.\n\nOh and while you are at it - maybe recognising how Ghost disables counterplay and changing the spell could help. Just maybe.",

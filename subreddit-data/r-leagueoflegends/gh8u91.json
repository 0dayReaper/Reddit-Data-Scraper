You're right, he makes little use of enchanter items but once stacked becomes one of the better poke-ADCs so you can together be an oppressive poke threat when sieging. Also even bad Ezreals will usually be competent enough to E-W-Q a rooted target which, if you're full AP can amount to a lot of pressure and even a kill if one or both of you have ult. Full AP also lets you help him push waves, which is his most annoying weakness. You need to wear the pants in this lane, my friend.",

She's much easier to bully out of lane than an ezreal, at least he can stay safely back and take potshots with q to secure minion last hits. Her big upside is that she WRECKS tanks, a champ type that can easily ruin ezreals day, is the best adc at killing super minions if your inhibitor goes down thanks to silver bolts dealing true damage, scales like a fricking beast, and is extremely safe during team fights thanks to her ult giving tumble a low cd and invisibility allowing easier repositioning to stay safe.",

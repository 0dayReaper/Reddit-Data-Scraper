It\u2019s like these players are compelled to play ranked as if it were breathing.\n\nA few of the main traits these players share are:\n\n(Main one) \u2022 Easily tilted - they expect a free and easy win, as soon as any challenges are presented they give up.\n\n\u2022 No map awareness (tunnel vision).\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t know when to rotate.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t understand what scaling is.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re one of these players, don\u2019t be discouraged if a challenge presents itself, that challenge is how you learn and grow to become a better player.\n\nNo painz no gainz.",

Last game was about five years ago and I spent thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars on it.  It just stopped being fun.\n\nI was never trying to be some great player.  I was fine with losing.. obviously I wanted to win and I always tried hard, but if you lose, you lose.  But the negativity that pervades the community single handedly turned me off.\n\nI think mobas are actually a great genre, they should be a lot of fun, but what people don't realize is that with ranking systems, you rise to your level of incompetence.  That is to say, you win until you're not good enough to beat the competition at a certain level unless you improve, and lots of us just plateau and can't figure out how to beat that level of player we're stuck at.  Unless you're a legit world class player, that's how it works.  And it's hilarious and sad that toxic players don't realize they're stuck in the same level you are for a very logical reason: that's where you're ranked right now.  And maybe their toxicity affects their winrate, but of course they're not ever going to even consider that.\n\nAnyway, back to Harvest Moon and Mario Kart, games which are too ridiculously casual to get all upset over.\n\nThat fuckin blue shell though.

At least in overwatch, you can still get a couple a kills and have fun, even if getting massacred.\n\nI also feel like you can \"hard carry\" and will your team to victory in other games. In this game, it doesn't matter if you got 10 kills playing mid when your botlane dies 18 times in 20 minutes.",

How you doing?\n\nI used to play a lot of SR norms and the like, but I got frustrated with the two pick systems being very frustrating. Blind pick was just an absolute shit show and a dumpster fire to the max. Draft was fun... except for how it supposedly would mean you would get to play what you wanted, you usually wound up either getting countered, banned out, or it would get picked by them. So fucking hard to learn a new character or an old one when you can\u2019t even guarantee a game with them. Team builder was great for that (Queue times were ass, but at least every game you got was actually guaranteed on the champ you wanted in the position you wanted.)\n\nIt probably sounds odd then that I love ARAM after just bitching about not being guaranteed a champ, but it\u2019s more the expectation thing. I go into ARAM knowing that I won\u2019t get a specific champ. I can reroll and grab from the bench as needed, but I\u2019m not guaranteed anyone and it\u2019s upfront about that. ARAM is going to a strip club and the girls saying up front that you can\u2019t pick any of them. Draft is going to the strip club and the signage saying that you get to pick, but then you really don\u2019t. SR is a fucking cock tease of a game mode.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on Ranked. That\u2019s just a fucking shit show.",

Games are designed a specific way to entice you in and keep playing. Considering league is a free to play game, there are a lot of hidden costs namely buying RP etc for skins and stuff. But, more importantly time. I'd suggest you look into skinner box for video games because thats basically what league is. Stuff like promo system from going from gold to plat and winning 5 games is completely unecessary. Means you need a 66% wr when ideally you should have like a 52% if you want to climb.

The higher skilled you go, the better people learn how to punish off meta strategies.\n\nBut here's the thing: you will hit a skill ceiling, where meta picks will lose you games anyway. This is just how matchmaking works  -- it tries to get you to 50% winrate.\n\nInstead, if you play off-meta picks and tank your ranks, eventually you'll get to play with slightly less skilled people and you'll start to win games again. Your artificial ranking will be lower, but in returns you get to enjoy the game with a much bigger available champion pool.",

You'll often find yourself in games that are effectively over by 10 minute mark, yet you're finding yourself stuck in that game for another 20+ minutes. It feels like completely wasted time, because... it is! You do not even have the option to quit the game, unless 3 of your teammates also agree to quit. \n\n2. You're playing ADC and you're going even in bot lane. But it's 5 minutes into the game and your top laner has already died twice. At 10 minutes, the enemy top laner is incredibly fed and no one on your team can deal with him. You're probably going to get shit on in team fights despite you playing well yourself. You're going to probably lose due to how bad your top laner lost. This is what I mean by \"not in control of your own destiny\". You never got a fair chance to beat that enemy top laner. You got an UNFAIR chance to beat them, because by the time you got to fight that enemy top laner he already got fed a lot of gold that you could never have possibly stopped from happening.\n\n3. Snowballing exists in many modern games and, when done tactfully, it's totally fine. An example of good snowballing is Halo 3, where players can get a powerful item on the map like a sniper rifle or rocket launcher. This gives them a *temporary* boost in power relative to others on the map. But in LoL, when people get gold, item, level, and objective buff advantages, then they get PERMANENT advantages over others. You could outplay them and still lose badly simply because they are so much stronger. Combine this fact with fact \\#2 and you're in for games that feel very unfair.\n\nI believe that the best thing Riot could do to make LoL less frustrating to play is reduce game length significantly. I would do that by reducing minion wave size, increasing speed at which minions come (every 20 seconds instead of every 30), reducing turret HP, increasing death timers, increasing passive gold generation (or reduce item costs), increase experience gains globally, etc. Let's have average game lengths of 20 minutes, with forfeit option at 10 minute mark.",

Even in other long games like CS you have round-by-round gameplay where only economy carries over, and even that is temporary and can be countered with saving. You always hold the mentality of a fresh start every round, while in League it just snowballs worse and worse until you literally can't make a difference and its super frustrating. In CS always have a fair chance of coming back.",

Keeps flaming jg (who actually is doing bad but not troll bad or game losingly bad)  \n\n\njg gets tilted and start trolling and they are each trying to out troll each other by taking turns stealing cs from each other in the jg and mid and both of them running to top and bot to ks or just int.  \n\n\nLose game.  \n\n\nNext game you get a bot lane duo that are first timing champs, go a combined 3/18 and feed enemy kalista/veigar.

It's becoming one of the few games where I feel like shit even after I win. Frustrating encounters, frustrating teammates, feeling the need to go sweaty in a non-ranked game. Lots of toxicity, all-round. A lot of other games are not like this.",

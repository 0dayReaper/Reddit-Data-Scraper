I remember seeing a video where in one of the clips heimerdinger ults someone (maybe Kaisa?) and theres theres the Overwatch Pharah \"rocket barrage incoming\" sound on it. It was like one of my favorite videos to watch and it always made me laugh. \n\nDoes someone know the video, if you do could you maybe link it on this post? Id greatly appreciate it :) Finding that older piece of league meme history would mean alot.",

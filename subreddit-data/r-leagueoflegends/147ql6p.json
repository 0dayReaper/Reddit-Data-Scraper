Having a level lead is an auto win in lane, and 2 waves is about the same amount of gold as a kill, so each wave you miss is a gigantic hit to your strength and money.\n\nHope this helps",

Still suck at league (silver) and don\u2019t play a ton, but I do know some shit in theory. My personal curriculum for my league education is: \n\nYouTube - finding a high elo player, coach or educational channel that focuses on your role. Some YT channels like Skill Capped get criticized a lot, but can be fine for learning absolute basics, especially if you remember to critically analyze what you\u2019re able to actually successfully apply in game. Can also just search \u201cX champ guide\u201d, watch a few, and get a broader perspective on one champ. If the videos are older, the items will definitely be different, so could be valuable to try to find the newest videos you can, year or less is probably safest. \n\nPodcast: Broken by Concept is my go to, though it focuses on more advanced player development. I don\u2019t have a good beginning podcast recommendation, sorry. \n\nReading: There are pretty in-depth guides on mobafire.com that people write out explanations for their build decision-making. You can learn what items do, which ones to build in which circumstances, which stats are best for which champ, etc. \n\nTwitch: Find a streamer or two you like, especially if you find they tend to describe their decision-making process as they play. \n\nIt\u2019s not much reading, unlike this comment, but you could study those videos or podcasts like they were readings. I do, but for TFT, and I climbed from Bronze 2 to Plat 3 this past season, so I can at least say that has been helpful for me. Welcome to the fucked up League club!",

I like to read more than watch to learn so I understand it can be frustrating, but there\u2019s not really a singular written \u201cmanual\u201d for how to play. There are a bunch of people on YouTube that break down champs and gameplay and macro you can watch which is as close as you\u2019ll get. You learn by watching people and playing games. If you have the attention span for it, watching pro play can help with macro (LCK or LPL). ARAM and co op vs AI are decent for learning teamfighting and learning how to farm respectively. (The AI isn\u2019t really good for anything other than learning abilities and learning to farm, it\u2019s too stupid.) ARAM will force you to learn new champions and give you a feel for which class and which champs are better and who counters what.\n\nRunes are very situational for most champions. Try experimenting with what feels good in the practice tool or against AI. You should start with a few champs that you wanna learn first and find some high elo players that make videos on them and they\u2019ll usually explain which runes they take into different matchups and why.",

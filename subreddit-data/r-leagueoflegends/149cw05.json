    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter many, many, years of playing this game, I finally hit diamond. Tried many champions, Riven, Yasuo, Fiora, Vayne, etc and I was never able to do it.\n\nNow that I am mostly maining Qiyana, I finally was able to reach my goal. Ever since I started playing this game in 2015, Diamond was my goal. Everyone above it seemed completely unobtainable, and even diamond felt like it would never happen with me being bronze back when I first started. I'm just very excited and happy to share my accomplishment with you.\n\nQiyana was my main champion I played in order to do this, ending off with a 65% win rate with 75 Qiyana games played.\n\n[https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/Faded%20Gravity](https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/Faded%20Gravity)\n\n\\*please note I am still aware diamond 4 is not good, but it was my goal since I started playing this game and I am very excited.\\*",

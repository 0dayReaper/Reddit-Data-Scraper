So it's not a buff for bruisers, just not a nerf either (if we pretend bruisers were using it lol)\n\n**For anyone saying it's supposed to nerf ADC: It won't. It has a very low pickrate and winrate so all it does is force the users into a better rune. It reduces rune variety without nerfing ADC.**\n\n**For anyone saying it's supposed to nerf Pro-Play: It won't. Every single adc pro build uses PoM.** ~~(source:~~ [~~https://probuildstats.com~~](https://probuildstats.com/)~~)~~ EDIT: Aphelios and Zeri use overheal, rest doesn't.\n\n**For anyone saying the nerf isn't big: It's huge, it's a 20-30% shield nerf for its current users.**",

They could change it to 14% max hp if they want bruisers to use it. \n\nliterally the only champ using it is aphelios the other adcs have max 20% pickrate with it. So why leave aphelios untouched but nerf his garbage rune? It's so nonsense. \n\nNerf aphelios and either change overheal to 14% max hp or just don't nerf it",

Marginal at the moment but it is one.\n\nThen re: Aphelios - It is a nerf for him because of this strong correlation between him and the rune, you can almost consider the rune part of his kit. And nerfing the rune in particular is actually targetting the champion's issues.\n\nPlus he got a small nerf recently and I believe they want to see what happens before going all out on him.",

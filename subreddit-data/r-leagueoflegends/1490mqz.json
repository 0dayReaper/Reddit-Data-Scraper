With all the adjustments for skin vault/loot system, I think victorious skins should be placed in a system like the old gemstone shop. So instead of earning a skin, players earn a victorious token for a skin of their choice.\n\nLet me know your thoughts",

It's not to feel a sense of \"pride and accomplishment\". If you need that to feel like you didn't waste hundreds of hours climbing, you can look at a border or rank or icon. \n\nIf players put in the time and effort, they should be able to get any skin for any champion.

It is a proof that I have played back then and I was good enough to claim Gold (or was commited enough to play 200 games, if we want to use skins like Victorious Anivia as argument in a few years).\n\nIf Riot was to unvalut this skin, it would lose its whole meaning. Now, when I play this skin, enemy is \"Damn, he plays since season 4\". After unvault, they would be \"He plays either since S4 or claimed it last week\". Impressiveness disappears.\n\nI get your point, tho. Few years ago, I was Janna OTP and I really wanted Victorious skin for her. But I wanted it for its prestige and meaning. Things that would be lost during unvaulting. So I just dealt with the fact that it's impossible and moved on.",

Even if they don't unlock the old skins they need to update the current system, its outdated as fuck if they think giving people a reward they wont ever use makes sense. Where's the reward in that?",

It's very hard for free skin to be better than paid one due to company resources allocation. I would also like to see another type of reward/skin that actually looks good enough to choose it over other skin that was designed to be so good that people spend money on it. Just like they revamped Crime City, High Noon or Prestige, they should also revamp Victorious.",

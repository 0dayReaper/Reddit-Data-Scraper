Of course you either lose a gank or lose the item, so it didn't seem like there was a good resolution that both parties can agree too.\n\nI guess they made Aiming sell it at the end since it was his fault for purchasing it (not sure if Riot can actually remove an item from shop for custom games in a short notice).",

Game 2 happens and KT is behind a bit of gold, around 1k but its fine. Aiming recalls and decides to buy Statikk Shiv. A 'forbidden banned item\" because apparently there is a bug with renata which causes you to auto creeps and gives her the gold or something, but renata wasn't even in this game. They pause for an hour deliberate (no joke), and finally come back, and force Aiming to recall and sell the item. Which basically means GG for KT, they cant fight any drakes cause their adc is down gold bad and auto lose the game off of it. Game 3 happens and KT are so tilted you can tell by how they are playing, they are a shell of themselves and pretty much play horribly and auto lose that game. The least authentic bo3 ever documented.",

    "postText": "I've been playing for about 10 years now, and the toxicity in this game continues to reach increasingly nauseating levels year after year.  I used to spend my time writing out clear reports on toxic behavior (like intentional feeding, soft inting, sabotaging team fights, baiting teammates), but it's become clear from how toxic this game is, that whatever system Riot has implemented to discourage toxic behavior, it's not working.\n\nThe system we have now is actually more of a mental burden for the victimized players, who have to take the time and write out what sort of things were detrimental to the game, only to see the EXACT SAME BEHAVIOR get repeated sometime in the next 3 games they play.\n\nAt this point, I've completely given up on the reporting system.  It's actually easier for my mind if I just mentally check out at the post game lobby and go next, instead of spending any amount of energy on trying to recall/relive the bullshit I just had to deal with.  Honestly, why would players spend time reporting behavior that isn't being punished?\n\nSo yea, I've checked out of the reporting system because it's literally not helping reduce problematic behavior - it polices chat and that's about it.  But it seems that in my absence of reports, on the regular Riot is sending me an alert that they disciplined a chat violator who I didn't report.  \n\nThis alert does nothing to encourage me to write more reports, because I don't care about chat violations when I can instantly mute people - what I care about games that are constantly being sabotaged by other players, of which there is nothing being done about it.\n\nRiot is literally a billion dollar company that is doing business across the planet.  I think it would be great if they could use some of their resources to hire human teams to investigate problem players, instead of relying on automated systems to keep the community safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Meaningless alert](https://preview.redd.it/e41714y9et5b1.png?width=523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=78f34aaa46b689128c4583b4a3ea378dfb0fc810)",

Social media companies have to do this, or else nobody would buy ad space on their platform.\n\nRiot on the other hand, is a $1 billion game company, and they easily have the money to hire sufficiently sized teams to police their ranked ecosystem if they really wanted to.   \nRiot states that it doesn't want toxicity in it's game, yet toxicity has been present here for so long that it's become a part of this League's culture.",

Sometimes I also add intentional feeding if its really obvious.  \n\n\nYou don't even have to have chat enabled. I reported so many people for verbal abuse and negative attitude when I had chat entirely turned off (reporting based on spam pinging, its really obvious when people are flaming)",

Murder and stealing are against the law, and you go to jail, but these things still happen. \n\nMy point is that i think there needs to be more positive reinforcement in league to get the toxic players to want to be better people.",

Sure we still had toxic Streamers, but you always had an Alternative, for every toxic Streamer there was a Voyboy, an Imaqtpie, a Shipthur.\n\nNowadays all you really have is either educational Content like Vars or Exil, or just every single other Streamer who gets mad and yells untill their Eyes pop out of their fucking Sockets when something goes bad. That's the Type of Content Creators the new Members of the Community get and that's the Behaviour they'll reproduce.",

Smaller games with less resources have figured out how to fix this shit, there's literally no reason for riot to sit back and do nothing other than that they don't feel the need to because people are still playing and buying shit etc, which is genuinely a very shitty reason to drive off what are probably honestly better players that just don't want to put up with the \"guess I gotta play extra games every day/week/month just to make up for these idiot assholes\" grind bullshit and instead want people who they get matched with to actually play the fucking game and not be bitch babies even if they're behind. \n\nThe mental in this game continues to slip further, while riot sits on their hands about it. Mostly because the poster child for this game literally acts like a child and if they did anything they'd have to lose that free exposure and marketing they get. But also because they think that for some reason the rest of us are ok with these clown babies to be in our matches at all (truthfully I don't even really like them on the enemy team even though it's virtually guaranteed to be a free win, I genuinely think they sway the results of matches too much and it makes it impossible for something like mmr to be accurate).",

I don't think it would be possible to hit a definitive zero mark on it, but I'd say that if it's affecting more than 5% of matches (1 in 20) that it's substantially overrepresented and a significant issue. \n\nWhy should I, as a player who rarely types in chat outside of things important to the game (summs, ults, enemy jungler unable to contest objective) and does not afk, ever get matched with someone who does... well, the opposite (only types to flame teammates, afks, soft/hard int, etc)? Me being on their team won't change their behavior, I can verify that much. I shouldn't have to babysit someone's mental just to make sure that the other 4 of us who are actually ahead don't get completely fucked over by one player who dies a single time and types \"ff 15\" in chat every 20 sec after. \n\nThis might be a controversial take but one of the reasons older players are nostalgic for the way the game was before is because comebacks were a thing and people didn't have wet toilet paper mental, and ffing was not something floated in chat by at least 1 player on each team every game before 10 minutes. I genuinely think the game would be in a better state if the ff option was reset to its original state where it's only active past 20 minutes and requires 4 yes votes, since it would force people to at least fucking try for 20 minutes until baron spawns. And to the people with weak mental who don't want this: git fucking gud you crybaby bitches, grow the fuck up and learn you're only one part of the formula and you're not necessary for the rest of us to succeed.",

Before, no one was actually getting punished and when they did it was basically part of a mass shadow banning that would become pointless the second these people created a new account.\n\nNow it feels like I get these reports if someone sneezed at their monitor and it vaguely sounded a slur. Neither of these system policies have given me any confidence that the it's actually making any affect in the game.",

Any pro adc can play every adc, but they don't. They have certain roles within the adc role to fill and bans can effect that.

Scarra has been playing a lot of meta on stream recently probably trying to get back into shape.\n\nQT has been pretty vocal about wanting to go pro again as well but not being open to moving back to Cali unless he had a good deal so CS makes sense for him too.\n\nShiphtur has been team searching for quite some time so I can definitely see him giving in and joining a CS team.\n\nDon't watch much Voy or Dyrus so dunno what they've been saying.\n\nEdit: for those asking NACS is played online until the Finals far as I know. Dunno if that'll change this split or not.\n\nAlso QT lives on the North East coast which is why moving back to Cali would be a pretty large commitment especially with him having a house.",

We want to be clear that the decision to restrict Swain games is an action taken to protect lower-ranked players from themselves. Do they want to end up in Platinum? Diamond? Above? We know they really don't want to be in the big pond with the big fish, and this action is taken to prevent exactly that. Swain is a meme pick--we recommend gold players and below actually perform their due diligence by listening to their overlords, the mega hot streamers and diamond youtube content creators.  \n\n&gt; \"...the limit of three games will be imposed until Swain's winrate has returned to normal. Thank you for understanding!\"\n\nAs well, players silver and below will no longer be allowed to play Rammus. Highly respected and diamond-ranked coach BaldBaby92 claims that this move will \"stop the plebes from ruining my games, or taking Swain from me in Champ Select.\" \n\nMore at 11 or what the fuck ever",

            "comment": "It is with a burdened conscience that I must reveal the following underlying game mechanics in this post, in order to retain proper control of champion spawns to Summoner's Rift.\n\nFew people know this, but there is a limit to the number of Swains allowed on the rift at any given time. When you lock in Swain, you are actually borrowing the champion from a \"champion pool\" behind the scenes, available to players during draft. Normally, players may draft Swain and play him on the rift, but what happens if a player picks Swain, but there are no more Swains left in the pool? This clearing house mechanism is essential for fair* gameplay. Of course you don't know this. Why would anyone want to ~~make us money~~ play the game if they know their draft pick isn't available to play 100% of the time? So you see, it's for the common good of teh League community that they don't know what we do.\n\nWe at Rito GameZ regret that having this \"champion pool\" is a necessary evil. We would like to state that we will *never* take action to affect the state of the Champion Pool with out expressing such actions in a post like this (e.g. crashing client, not allowing game to start, advertisements to watch LCS/LEC to ensure competitive players have Champion Pool prio, etc.) They only way to replenish the champion pool is to purchase skins for champions (champion shards are simply fractions of whole champions taken from the pool, when a champion is over-represented in the pool).\n\nObviously, we want players to keep ~~making us money~~ having fun playing the game, so we have allowed players to keep picking Swain. The trouble is, you won't actually get to *play* Swain, because we lied about the amount of Swains we have off hand to meet player's pick demands. For those of you who have picked Swain and are hodling on waiting for your game to load, please leave. Release your Swain pick back in to the pool, so that teh League community can continue growing. \n\nTrust us, this will *never* happen again. The actions taken to limit Swain picks of shit players will ensure that Swain is available for the players that ~~make us the most money~~ are able to best utilize the fun he provides.\n\n**fair* implies that you are Diamond 1 with an account that is noted to be actively climbing the ladder.",

Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.\n\nHedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn\u2019t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it\u2019s unlikely that it\u2019s anyone at all.\n\nALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DON'T GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!\n\nGET RID OF THE STOP LOSSES, THEY WILL TRY HUNT THEM\n\nIt's possible the ladder attack at the end of day yesterday was just a trial run for today. They held the price where they wanted it (around 227) for ages, and then with just one ladder attack got it to 197 which had two effects:\n\n1) Caused a volatility halt at 15:59:41 - so we had no chance to get it back over 200 in those remaining 19 seconds 2) Made sure the EOD price was under 200\n\nI think today there is a chance that they won't go for 150, 115 or 100, but just take the guarantee of hitting under 200. Take a beating over a killing.\n\nThey will want it resting on around 227 and then time their attack to sneak it just under 200 with the halt in place to see out the clock. So if it is ~227+ with under 10 mins to go, we know what they will do. And those few minutes before it could be crucial.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e",

It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local Swain ranked game, I play swain at least 3 times a week for promo games and a norm, 1-2 times for aram on the weekend (dodge alot to get swain), and maybe once for RGM when I'm in a rush but want a great game mode that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily swain needs.\n\nI even plug swain in my legends of runeterra deck, it's OP!

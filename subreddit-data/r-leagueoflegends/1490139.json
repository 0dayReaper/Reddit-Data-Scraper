    "title": "Finals of all tournaments should be BO7 with maximum of 6 games in one day. If it goes to 7, it's played one day later for player recuperation. It's the best to determine best team, but AWFUL for ticket buyers that makes it impossible.",

(When players are shaking before the game over built up tension throughout hours and months to be decided in a few hours)   \n\n\nThey deserve a rest, for the viewers sake and players sake and investors sake (including people that bet).  \n\n\nFinals is about finding the best team, winning every game prior to the finals, to be eliminated in the finals is disgusting, not \"hype\". Period.  \n\n\nTime-wise: OBLITERATES people who are time strict to a schedule like a job or anything. WHICH MAKES THIS IDEA IMPOSSIBLE.....................or we can have Bo7 and one long day. And just say \"bro they played 20+ games in one day before, 7 stage games would be equivalent of stress and allow for adapting mid-series\"kinda heartless but you know 1 Bo5 is dingo garbage disrespectful.",

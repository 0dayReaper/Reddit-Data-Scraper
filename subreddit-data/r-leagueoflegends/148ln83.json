Why is it not?\n\nNot a rioter, but if I had to guess, it'd be because the original code did not account for mass disenchanting, making the code for every different type of \"disenchantable\" different. Ideally, you'd write this:\n\n    foreach Disenchantable d in Loot:\n        d.Disenchant()\n\nBut if some loot items disenchant to blue essence, some disenchant to orange essence, some to a new emote, or some actually need multiple to create a new item instead of a resource (skin rerolling) I can imagine that the method isn't standardised.\n\nIs this good practice? No, but as someone who codes, I can absolutely relate to not knowing where your system will end up and unwittingly making bad decisions in the process.\n\nIt's a bit like converting a car from manual to automatic, when automatic transmissions haven't been invented yet. Sure, you might learn to understand the difference between a manual gearbox and an automatic gearbox, but that doesn't change the fact that the car wasn't designed to have a replacable one; in turn meaning that you might have to dismantle the entire engine just to do so.\n\nAnd again, I'm not a Rioter and as such I'm not privy to their actual code and what caused this issue, but literally almost every single project I've ever coded I've hated afterwards, and wanted to rewrite from the ground up. Therein lies the problem: if your automatic gearbox doesn't mesh well with the rest of your car, you can just release a new car, and the old one still works. Software, especially a game the size of LoL, doesn't have this luxury. The new League client _has_ to comply with the previous one on a fundamental level, or else you have to completely rebuild _everything_ and have every player download League 2.0, or maintain two different versions and playerbases.\n\nWhile for one last time making the disclaimer that I'm not a Rioter and there's essentially a 0% chance that this comment is 100% accurate, I'm reasonably confident that the _tech debt_ problem I've described here is at least part of the reason why this problem is so hard to fix.\n\n**TL;DR** the astounding interconnectivity (and shortcut usage) that computer code almost always has means that things that are intuitively very similar might not be that way in the actual code implementation.",

Champs that are tanky due to lifegain effects get really broken with ARAM buffs.\n\nOn the other hand supports get 20% nerfs and don't care that much.\n\nBut what's really fucking amazing is how Vlad continues to dodge nerfs despite being able to at least 1v3 every game.",

Q cooldown starts when the barrel is thrown, not detonated, so he can throw another one immediately after popping a slightly cooked barrel. He can hold a choke with Q indefinitely, the moment the barrel times out he can throw a new one in. Also his E scales infinitely better with AH than most abilities, coming down to a near 0 cooldown as well, and his W damage reduction can be almost 100% uptime if he autos quickly after drinking.",

It completely nerfs his current strengths which are early and mid game and might not be giving him enough power later to make up for it. It doesn't look like he'll be very much stronger late game and they hamstrung his early game kill pressure. They also nerfed his W and he still doesn't have viable sustain top lane and will still get destroyed by most bruisers but now he won't even be able to have kill pressure early. I think this is mostly a buff to jungle he has just fallen behind the curve as far as how much top laners have in their kits.\n\nI think most pointless change though is the dumbing down of his heat mechanic and it probably won't have a huge impact for good players. His best trade damage involves overheating so players are just going to hover 100 now instead of 50 and he's still going to be too squishy to take advantage of using two rotations in a fight anyways. Especially because his role is basically just lay down ult and overheat and try to kill someone as fast as possible in a fight.   \n  \nIt's almost as if the person making these changes has never played rumble in the late game. AP itemization is terrible for tanky stats in the late game and you'll always be squishy or do no damage. A better change would be to give champs that don't need mana liandries back then these dumb Q changes. Why are we completely changing a champ when his itemization was fucked with the item rework anyways.",

I know its not a lot of games but like..... its just fucked. Sitting here playing games don't even feel that hard meanwhile top laner going like 2-13 or yas mid going 4-16 and you sit there thinking \"wtf\". But no..... its the people saying the bad words that was always the problem with game quality and who need to be banned. Not the trolls and intent feeders....... Don't think there's anyway Riot can fix this issues its been too many years and now eveyone has multiple accounts.

    "postText": "Hey im Vitor, and I have been playing League since 2011\n\nI cannot express how much I am frustrated with this game not having a voice chat, I don't know how many games I lost because of bad communication with my teammates, in my opinion, the game is far too complex to be able to express what you want to do by the means of pings, It's like asking someone to explain trigonometry with 1's and 2's, the game NEEDS a shot-caller, a voice, fast communicative calls! \n\nI have read a rioter explaining why they would NOT implement a voice chat in the game because of people feeling shy about their voice, and ending up feeling pressured into talking, listen, the game is COMPETITIVE if they do not want to feel pressured then don't play ranked at all because that itself is a very stressful environment regardless of voice chat or not, people expect you to perform and that's it.\n\nLet us not forget why we are playing ranked, to win, most players I know, don't play ranked to have fun they play to climb the ladder, and I doubt that adding a voice chat in the game would negatively impact your odds of a victory, in fact, it would make the game more coordinated and organized. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/148rwgx)",

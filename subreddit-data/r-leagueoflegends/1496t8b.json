The lp gains are similarly screwed for me too. It feels like the system makes it impossible for you to climb. And I know stats do not tell the whole story, but my stats are not even remotely as horrendous as this one, actually OP seems like the person who is in an opposite situation, as he is very bad at the game, but he stays relatively same rank, cuz of the matchmaking system. Don't really want to sound offensive, but this guy is consistently outclassed by his role opponents and he usually has bad kda even in winning games. It feels like he and people like him are the reason why I can't climb(or at least climb faster), cuz whenever I win games I am paired with people with similar performances. I mean, literally , he has 2 13 score on malphite in a game where they won, like how worse can it get?",

I'm posting here my latest version of my project, but it is a demanding read with lots of details about her whole kit and needs prior knowledge about her. Please let me know your thoughts and let's discuss!\n\nP.s : the Power stacking mechanic was in my project long before the official update was announced and i can prove that, but i did take inspiration from their update for the E effect.\n\nDocument: [(ENG) My ideal Syndra - Documenti Google](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GuFZ3jTfiCjCGRzYNsr1RZQ1J6rn8MfzZKmpTMDN3DA/edit)\n\nThe pro player's reaction: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1843432580?t=09h41m49s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1843432580?t=09h41m49s)",

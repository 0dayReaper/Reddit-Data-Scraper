    "postText": "There was a video showcasing a 1v1 with Yasuo and Yone with a different kit. Yone's icon was just a red \"Y\" with a black background. In the vid Yone's W is 2nd lunge just like like his Q which can build stacks and at 3 stacks makes him recoil backwards as he throws wind at the enemy(like cait E) . He follows enemy dashes with his E and his ult knocks people up and then pushes them away from him in a circle (kinda like gragas+diana). If I remember correctly Yone's current model wasnt used and was replaced with Nightbringer Yasuo",

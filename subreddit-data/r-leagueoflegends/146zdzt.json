    "postText": "I'm pretty sure i'm not the only one with dozens if not hundred of emote by now who likes to arrange them depending on the champion I play. But the menu to find them is just terrible and the search bar barely helps.\n\nHow are you supposed to find out angry Neeko by typing \"I will destroy you\"?\n\nOr thumbs up troll Lux \"Nice try\"?\n\nOr Cowboy hat tipping TF with \"nothing personal\"?\n\nEach emote should have a set of tags to em, basics like champion's name, skinline, event, emotion/gesture. I get it extra work for little reward but at some point adding more emotes to your collection isnt all that incentiving anymore if you feel like you're not gonna use most of them anyway because of the poor search system.",

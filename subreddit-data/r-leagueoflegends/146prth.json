            "comment": "As the other dude said he is deceptively difficult. Not because toolkit is overly difficult (it is a tiny bit compared to others) but i feel like after playing him compared to other assassins that he gets SERIOUSLY overly punished for the same things every other jungler does. If u fuck you u fuck up and just die. Shaco does not get ANY blunder recovery. Compared to talon, zed, eve, kha, and most other assassins im not remembering all have some form of \"oh i jumped over into a blantant mistake, i can pop my ult to escape rather than kill bye\" shaco has \":&gt; hehe oopsie ima pop clone and 50/50 the enemys IQ\"",

I always dodge the game when i have him on my team, simply awful experience cuz they are always cooking and most of the time cooking shit",

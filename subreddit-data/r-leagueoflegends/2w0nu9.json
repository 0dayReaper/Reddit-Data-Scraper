                    "comment": "**Context for /r/all:**\n\n* **TSM** and **CLG** are professional teams in North American League of Legends Championship series.\n * TSM and CLG are the two most popular teams in NA. They are currently at the top of the table, but they have maintained a very high fan support even when CLG was facing relegations (dropping from the NA LCS).\n * Their game was a regular game in the league season, but due to the popularity of the teams and potential implications, it was highly anticipated. All sorts of internet hype ensued.\n * The winner of this game is most likely going to remain on top of the table next week, and therefore gain a spot at **Intel Extreme Masters World Championship Final** in Katowice, Poland, the biggest independent LoL tournament out there. More on that on the bottom of this post.\n * CLG and TSM are old rivals; it's one of the longest and strongest rivalry in the LoL world. Challenges, taunts and even insults are not unheard of. their head-to head score in regular season matches before this game was 8-8.\n * The amount of hype lead to a bet: the owner of the losing team has to dye their hair pink.\n* **League of Legends** is a video game based on Defense of the Ancients (Dota), a mod for Warcraft 3, a real-time strategy game. If you know what it is, scroll down to the next point in bold.\n * Two teams of 5 players fight in order to destroy enemy base. Whoever destroys the enemy *nexus*, wins.\n * In an RTS-like setup, players control single units, *champions*. There are AI units that walk towards the enemy base, *minions*, and neutral units, *monsters*.\n * In order to destory the center of the enemy nexus, teams have to destroy structures such as *towers* first.\n * There are secondary objectives that can power up your team, *Dragon* and *Baron* - powerful neutral bosses that take a team effort to kill. Dragon will be referenced to later.\n * Players start the game dueling against their opponents in one of the three *lanes*. They gain gold by killing enemies, enemy minions and neutral monsters.\n * Since there are 5 players and 3 lanes, one player moves to the *jungle* (later referred to as *jungler*) and the last one joins one of the occupied lanes as *support*.\n * Support usually assists the most vulnerable and important player, the *carry*, ensuring they survive the enemy attempts at killing them, and allowing the carry to safely gain up gold.\n * The middle lane is occupied by a mage/assassin type of champion that can disable an enemy with their spells and deal a huge amount of damage in a short time window. The *midlaner* can either pick off enemy champions or sit in the back and deal damage in subsequent bursts.\n * The third lane is called *offlane* in Dota, in LoL the last player is called *toplaner* even though they often end up alone in the bottom lane (this movement, called *laneswap*, did not exist when the terminology was forged). In an usual (amateur) game, the solo laner will be always in the top lane and the bottom lane will be filled by the duo (support + carry).\n* **TSM vs CLG game lived up to the hype**, and consisted of several strategic elements making a great show.\n * The pick and ban phase has set the CLG team on a timer. It was given that provided the game goes long (30-40 minutes), the TSM carry champion (Sivir) will be stronger than the CLG carry champion (Corki).\n * There were some other differences in scaling involved, for example the TSM's toplaner (Sion) deals next to no damage when the game goes very long, but in the end, it's the carry champions who deal the lion's share of damage.\n * Losing your carry in a full-blown teamfight (5v5) often means losing the fight, or having to withdraw.\n * However, the pick/ban phase did not go against CLG's plan - **their lineup gave them the tools to deal with the TSM midlaner** (Ahri). CLG's jungler (Vi) and midlaner (Lissandra) are both excellent at dealing with Ahri.\n * **In order to win, CLG had to maintain a decisive lead over TSM, which they did.** In the laning phase, the CLG duo (Corki + Janna) killed the TSM's toplaner (Sion) for the first kill of the game (*first blood*), gaining some extra gold. This continued, and a well-executed three-man assault on Sion gave CLG a second kill.\n * The CLG team continued to hold an advantage over the game, securing over and over an important secondary objective - the Dragon. Killing the Dragon grants your entire team a stacking buff, creating an impeding threat. Dragon respawns every 6 minutes, and when a team kills 5 Dragons, they gain an enormous buff to all sorts of stats that is quite overwhelming.\n * CLG has destroyed many TSM towers, gaining a *gold lead*, which meant that they had more money to spend on items that increase their statistics or provide unique effects. They also achieved *vision advantage* over TSM.\n * The vision advantage (having lots of invisible wards that spot the enemy) gave CLG tactical advantage over TSM, allowing them to destroy the TSM towers with no repercussion, as they could freely move through the TSM half of the map. It also gave them the possibility of safely killing Baron Nashor, the second neutral boss, which gives a huge buff for siegeing the enemy base.\n * **CLG has managed to secure 4 Dragons**, meaning the next one would be most likely the end of TSM. Paired with gold and vision advantage, it put the game highly in their favour, and the CLG carry champion Corki was at his strongest point. The kill score at the 30th minute mark was 7-7, but the advantage was clearly CLG's.\n * The pressure was especially visible when the CLG's toplane champion (Gnar) could harass and engage onto TSM's champions with no repercussion from TSM. After giving up the 4th Dragon, TSM lost a teamfight, with 3 champions dead on their side, which resulted in CLG destroying one of the last turrets, opening a hole in TSM's base.\n * Held against the wall and immediately after respawning after the lost fight, **TSM managed to pull a miraculous comeback** in a full-blown 5v5 teamfight. It resulted in them gaining the Dragon for themselves, postponing the 5 Dragon threat from CLG (and gaining the 1st stack of the Dragon buff, which is minor early in the game, but actually measurable when this late into the game).\n * The comeback can be attributed to incredibly well executed spell combination by TSM jungler (Jarvan IV) or a sum of bad play by the CLG midlaner (Lissandra) and carry (Corki). Lissandra's spell was arguably misused, after which Jarvan's disable combo resulted in her instant death before she could do anything, and Corki went too agressive and died to the TSM carry (Sivir). \n * One won teamfight did not mean the chances were back to equal: CLG still held a gold advantage and whenever the Dragon respawned, they could still get their 5th one.\n * **TSM won a teamfight for the second time**, suffering 2 deaths and taking down 3 CLG champions. With that advantage, they went on to fight the Baron. However, a quick return of the only two CLG champions alive (the jungler, Vi, and the midlaner, Lissandra), allowed CLG to interrupt the Baron attempt and take down 2 of the remaining 3 TSM champions, including their carry (Sivir). **The game, despite the comeback, was still on the knife's edge.**\n * With TSM's carry being dead, CLG took down their second Baron, gaining gold, a stat buff empowering their teamfight power, and a pushing buff that could secure them the game after a won teamfight. The teams began to circle around the respawning Dragon, which could be the 5th Dragon for CLG. The sum of Baron and 5th Dragon buffs gives incredible power that vastly increases the chance to win the game.\n * In the final teamfight around the Dragon pit, TSM wiped out 3 out of 5 CLG players, including their key players: carry (Corki) and midlaner (Lissandra) with no losses on their side. Having a huge numbers advantage (5v2), they've stormed the CLG base.\n * The CLG nexus was destroyed in a very close situation, with all the CLG players respawning in a matter of seconds. If TSM took 5 seconds longer, they could have gotten wiped out and lost the game.\n* The winner of this game is most likely going to the **Intel Extreme Masters World Championship Final**.\n * The IEM final takes place in Katowice, Poland.\n * IEM is the largest independent LoL tournament in the world (and the only major one remaining). Most of the professional games, world finals included, are organized by Riot Games themselves.\n * The event will be held in Katowice's Spodek, and last year it hosted 75 000 people visiting various esports competitions, including LoL, Starcraft 2 and Counter Strike: Global Offensive.\n * The top seed from NA will be invited. There are more games to come, but this one has given TSM the advantage and high morale for the next week.\n\n**TL;DR**: Two top teams of North America that are overhyped even when they don't perform played this time for the top spot in the League of Legends league (lol ^(lol x2)). The game was actually good and lived up to the hype.\n\n---\n\n^(goddamnit this is now my highest upvoted comment, surpassing my /r/gameofthrones followups T_T)",

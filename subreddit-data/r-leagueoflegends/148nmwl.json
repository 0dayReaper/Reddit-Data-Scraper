If you don't have demotion shield then you'll demote after a couple lost games on 0 LP. Frankly it's much harder to demote than promote, especially if your MMR is higher than the rank below it.",

            "comment": "I was demoted twice from gold, you get about 5-7 games of protection at zero LP, then the shield will turn red, next loss sends you back.\n\nInterestingly, I guess the game feels bad once you do get demoted because I climbed right back up same day both times.\n\nIt's not great tho because losing while not actually losing LP hurts your MMR and will make gains going forward tougher. I often times get about 20 for a win and lose 27 for a loss now so... It's rough lol. I have made peace with being eternally gold 4. (Unless the new ranking system moves me)",

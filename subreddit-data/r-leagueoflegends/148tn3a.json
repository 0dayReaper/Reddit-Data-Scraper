    "postText": "As a dirty yuumi main i wanna put some of my input in to how to potentially make this champion fair to play vs and maybe more skillful.\n\nTargatable yuumi:\nAllow her to still attach to champions but make her targetable and allow to circle the champion she's attached too. \nShe could help potentially with blocking for certain skill shots while also being at major risk of dying. Now i feel like the best friend mechanic would have to also be reworked to allow her to smoothly jump around the team without having to be stuck to your adc all game. (Also her hp/armour numbers?)\n\nJust an idea it might be a terrible one but after over 350 games on the champion that's personally how i would approach her.",

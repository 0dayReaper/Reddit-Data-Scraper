    "postText": "The only way to solve toxicity in SoloQ is with more sexually aggressive skins. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThink about it. What causes toxicity in Soloq? Toxicity exists because players play the game. However, by having more sexually aggressive skins/champions. By limiting the hands require to play the game to one the toxicity would be reduced literally to 50%. That one toxic player in your team? His toxicity now are reduced to 50%. He call your mom fat? He now calls you mom. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#But We already have some and that didn't help\nPool party Taric, Armor of the fifth age Taric, Ahri, Pajama Urgot, Rek Sai, etc. They are all great skins/champions but there is a greater demand than the supply. Everyone has their \"playstyle\" and not all their \"playstyle\" is being fulfilled. So more skins/champions would make players happier. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's compare real numbers. Not counting PBE let's say toxicity level in Fiddlestick Rework Patch is 10. Right now the toxicity level is 0 on Voibear Rework patch(10.11) as of today. You can even say no one is playing on that patch except Riot Client Programers. This is why I think Fiddlestick should have been reworked to a Waifu that hugs you when he ults and not this little scared farmer's son hiding in the jungle. \n\n#Real Science behind it\n Freud the father of Psychology says that libido, our sexual desire, drives our every action. Libido has a broader meaning than just sexual desire but it doesn't fit my narrative so I am going to ignore it. Right now League player's libido are not being fulfilled so they try to release it in ways that could be harmful to people around them and themselves. \n &amp;nbsp;\n\n#Top Lane\nTop lane has been recognized as one of the worst roles to play but there is a reason people still play them. If you ask any top laners why they **really** play top lane they would say \"I just want to see two big dudes smashing each other.\" This is why people play top. People pick Jax so they can see and feel Jax use his big and necessary large rod against Malphite who is literally just a big bulge. However, this is not enough for some players. When they play jax they imagine themself as Jax smashing Malphite but when they realize they are the one being smashed their mental collapse. Their libido went unfulfilled so they tried to smash anything that is close by which is in many cases their junglers. They smashed Jungler via their chat and well that is how toxicity start. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut if Jax or even Malphite has a attractive skin Jax wouldn't need to chat or int to fulfill his libido. He could simply zoom in on his character which he is already doing it anyway. He could just play his best and accept he can't be on top every game and sometimes he have to be bottom. This combine with 50% of hand usage elimination would eliminate toxicity on Top lane. \n#ADC\nADC players are masochists. They like being slaved around by their random braindead partner. They like comparing their suffering to other ADC and enjoy the rush of freedom when eventually their shackle are set free. That high when 0/10 Jinx reached 4 items and is no longer a ranged minion is something no any role can reach. But now that even when you reach 4 items that high is no longer guaranteed. 30 minutes of buildup just to be instantly killed off by a 0/2/99 mid laner. Where does that energy go? That energy that has been built up for the last 30 minutes? Into the chat it goes. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPeople start picking Mages bot not because they are stronger or something(lol) but because they have better skins. Ahri, Vlad, Ziggs, Syndra all have very attractive skins and only MF could really compete against them. Which is probably why MF has one of the highest pick rate and win rate. \n#Mid/Jungle/Support\nNO one cares about those roles. They don't do anything in game anyway so there is no need to talk about them. Right now games are decided by Top and ADC. Mid/Jungle/Support has no agency whatsoever compare to Top/ADC so there is no point talking about them. \n#It's time for more Kaisa Skin\nVoibear Rework is a step in the right direction. This would fulfill people with questionable desires and hopefully stop them from going outside. Many people libido are being unfulfilled and by giving them champions and skin that matched their disgusting desire they would be happier. Don't ask which demographic they made Yuumi for. For F2P player the Honor System could reward them with skins which would prompt them to think libido in long term and reward holding it in. Streamers should also be encouraged to equipped those skins so the viewers could learn that that is a way to release their libido. I don't think it is right to witch hunt streamers that don't equip those skins since everyone has their own \"preference\" and you never know what the context is. Unless obviously if they play Taric without Pool Party or Gem of the fifth age skin but even then just report them and don't personally attack them.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#What I am trying to say is: It is time to pull out Pool Part Urgot.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Potential Question:\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1. Why does NA have this problem and not Korea?\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA: Cause NA doesn't have Kpop and not having Kpop stars ruling your country is a big disadvantage culturally. Everyone there is playing League to please their Kpop King/Queen so victory is the way they fulfill their libido. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2. How about the little blue mens ruining my games??\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA: Those blue men are typically called smurfs and they are actually pro player/coaches trying to scout that Gold 4 Brand that solo killed Faker years ago. Unfortunately, the scout is unsuccessful but still ongoing and now it is almost a part of the game. Just try your best and maybe you can fool them that you are the brand player and get in LCS. Just remember that they are scouting because they are not at Faker's level so just laugh at them desperately trying to scout Faker killer in Iron 2 and being hardstuck at LCS. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3. What should I do when other player tries to fulfill their libido on me?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA: If you are into it you can enter their role play but just don't become the problem trying to solve the problem. Let's say your step-sister is stuck in the bathroom and needs your help. Don't go in and get stuck yourselves. Call the fire department because accidents in the bathroom are dangerous and can break some bones if you are not careful. Sometime the fire department comes too late or never comes. In that case, you should simply lock the door and cover your ear to prevent your sister's dying cry from traumatizing you. Know that even Saints like Voyboy are unsuccessful in helping others get unstuck. Don't get yourself stuck trying to help others because now your stepmom has to come help and it just keeps ongoing. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4.

    "postText": "Since coming back to the game I started playing  ranked again and constantly get people who die 1 time and troll the rest of the game. What doesn't make sense to me is anytime you decide to give advice to these players as well they get insta tilted and feed on purpose all because you told them the call they made was bad and caused us to lose a lot of objectives etc.\n\nOr I get players who go \"off meta bot lane\" and proceed to feed 0-20. Stop wasting peoples time. People need to start getting perma banned for this type of play.\n\nThe picture attached is the player who died one time in bot lane. Nothing negative was said. Disconnects from the game for 3 minutes comes back to sit top lane in a bush.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0oy9flj08l5b1.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=12cf9eff9ca12d689477ba3e0d08a41cb4bb2807\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/za8q2400cl5b1.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e9e567e2ab252921d70ac302c9264f3158cbb471\n\ngame promo 2 another leaver.

Of course you gotta make sure it\u2019s gankable but if it\u2019s not even helping grab herald or helping the jungler invade and take camps works. You could try that out. Just remember to continue going back to your lane and csing and staying caught up in xp and gold. If you keep it hard shoved against someone with poor wave clear and they follow you, even if you don\u2019t kill them they lose gold and xp mid lane if they don\u2019t get a kill on their roam. \n\nBut this doesn\u2019t work for every match up so you gotta get a feel for it over time on who you can out roam.",

I learned that it doesn't really matter what happens in a 30 minute game, and you're not serving toxic people on a game by giving them advice or even talking to them. You serve them by ignoring them, not giving attention to them, and focusing on your game. We all know they're useless, just leaving their words unheard is the most powerful thing you're allowed FOR FREE to do in the game, so use the MUTE button. Unmute pings for comms until the second some idiot spams and abuses it. I normally leave them because it's a waste of time for me to deal with and it doesn't affect me at all while I'm playing.\n\nDon't make a big deal, don't make a fuss. You're there to win a game to climb, to learn League, nothing more. The game gets more interesting once you leave this stupidity behind, mute /all chat and take breaks after rough games. Best wishes.",

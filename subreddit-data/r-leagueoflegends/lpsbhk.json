Having to readjust to skins every single game is annoying. Theres a reason LCS/Worlds had a ban list for skins. Some give a distinctive advantage that no one seems to talk about.\n\nEasiest example is elementalist lux.\nIt is absolutely fucking bullshit, for 12mins ive been dodging red colored skill shots and when I go to gank bot a Blue skill shot comes out of fog of war during the gank and I get pinned into being 100-0rd because I had to process who could of possibly been attacking me.\n\nSo i end up dieing because a brand new colored skill-shot came out of fog of war. And I decided to dodge a different skill and died for it cause lux changed her colors mid match.\n\nIts actually to the point where if enemy team has a lux with OG visuals it throws me off so hard cause its so hard for me to see them now.\n\n\nPLEASE LET ME DISABLE ENEMY SKINS!

It sounds like you have protanomaly (red cone spectrum is shifted too close to green cone), while OP suffers from protanopia (red cone absent). Even within protoanomaly the severity of the spectrum shift can vary drastically.\n\nThis is one of the major issues with colorblind support in video games. Dev team will find a protan (often an existing employee with protanomaly) and work with them to add a \"colorblind mode\" that satisfies that person's vision. They don't know that their solution only works for someone with equal or less severe colorblindness of that type.\n\nAlso, that is why the Enchroma test results say \"Strong Protan color blindness, also known as protanomaly...\" Enchroma glasses are only effective for those with anomalous colorblindness. Telling someone the truth that they have proanopia and that the glasses probably won't help is a lost sale and goes against their (deceptive) marketing.",

Probably even more so than giving the user the ability to disable skins. Sure, it wouldn't be an immediate profit, but it would definitely give the playerbase a boost as more people would be able to play.\n\nUnfortunately, because it isn't directly a profit it's unlikely they'd do any of these things. :/",

All they'd have to do for deaf players to alert them to sion/kled ults is put a little thing in the chat like \"sion/kled ulted watch out!\" But it's not there. I can't imagine them fixing all the indicators in the game for people with colorblindness. :(",

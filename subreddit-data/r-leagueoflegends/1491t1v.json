    "postText": "WBG (2-2) takes the first game against LGD (0-5) . Although LGD are 0-5 in the standings, they managed to take 4 out of 5 Game 1s meaning they have potential to win but fall short. Decade subs in for fearness at top. WBG are born to wintrade. They are very inconsistent sometimes, but their teamfighting is superior. Can LGD come back the next two games or will WBG take the series?",

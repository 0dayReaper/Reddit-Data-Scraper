Since they're that fast I assume they're bots but I'm not sure.\n\nDoes anyone have any more info? it happened twice in two days and I'm just curious, not particularly annoyed.\n\nAlso if they're indeed bots we could just report any profile of this type right? Would that work to prevent whatever business that is from growing?",

They don't need to make it annoying for regular users. Anyone who got introduced to League by friends should be able to add them from the beginning. Spam bots work because they can send hundreds to thousands of requests.",

Oh hey Riot. Remember that kind of bot accounts you didnt care for? Well... They are still there. And they are still making problems for the entire player base.",

And now what? They know which words are bad and which are not. So they use different words/spelling etc. System is countered, consequences 0.  \n\n\nOh they got a chat ban? No problem. People will troll differently. They will grief you until you are getting tired of it.  \n\n\nOh they got an account ban? Well... Thats preventing a lot of people of coming back... Or is it possible to have a cheap source of unlimited number of accounts? Oh right, you can buy new accounts for just a couple bugs and keep on going.   \n\n\nSo everytime Riot tells that they are doing something against the toxic people I know its worthless as long as they are still supporting multi accounts, botting, etc.",

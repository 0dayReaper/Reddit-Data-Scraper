And it's now been 5-and-a-half years.  \n\nHe was beat to death with a hammer and my grandmother discovered him when she arrived home.  Knowing it was family that did it made it so much worse.  \n\nHonestly, while I wouldnt admit it then, it really fucked with my head for a while.  I went from straight A's to failing, almost immediately.  Ended up dropping out of college 2 years later - suffering from (undiagnosed) depression, a likely symptom of my (diagnosed) PTSD.  \n\nWith all that being said, I can't imagine being Doublelift right now.  It was hard enough having my grandfather, who I had a good relationship with, pass away.  I've talked about this before on Reddit, but my father didn't have the best relationship with his father before his death (same grandpa) and it really tore him up.  And he had been 'reconciled' with his father since before my sister was born (who was about 25 when it happened).  \n\nThe (arguably) worst part of all of this is that it's not something you can get over quickly.  You still have a trial that brings a constant reminder for years after.  For my family, that trial dragged on for nearly two years, before my cousin finally confessed to the murder.\n\nDoublelift, while I doubt you will read this, if you do, the biggest advice I can give is to seek help.  I let my problems go for 2 years because I didn't think they were actual problems.  I know you're strong, but this isn't something you deal with on your own.  I wish you the best.  ",

My Mom attacked my Dad while he was sleeping by pouring gasoline over him and lighting him on fire. My Dad eventually passed on May 29th, almost a full month later, from the extreme burns from his waist up...and I mean the entirety of his body from the waist up. My Mother also died that day because she is no longer herself. My parents had a very happy marriage and this all came out of nowhere. Turns out my Mother was severely sexually abused as a child and then was raped when she was 19. She now thinks she's in 1984 and therefore does not know who my siblings and I are (I was born in 92). \n\nThere are two reasons for why I am putting myself out there:\n1. Mental illness needs to be talked about. It shouldn't be taboo and instead be communicated to approach possible ways to cope before something irreversible happens.\n2. As someone who has very recently experienced a traumatic event like Doublelift, I want to express my sincerest apologies. There is no 'protocol' for an event such as this and EVERYTHING will be tough. If he/Liquid somehow reads this, please encourage Doublelift to find options on initial therapy - even someone very close to you helps (my wife has helped immensely in this regard). The sooner that he can learn to understand what has happened, how his life has changed, and helpful techniques on moving forward...the better. I would be happy to reach out however I can if an opportunity arises. Hang in there.\n\n\nAgain, mental illness NEEDS to be discussed to further prevent horrible damage to families across the globe. \n\nEdit: Thank you for all of the kind replies and thank you for the Gold, friend. It makes me happy to be able to use this platform to speak out and encourage others to reach for help if they need it.",

It goes beyond gameplay - his story of how he entered the scene really hurt, and it's been personally incredible and rewarding to kind of grow up alongside him and watch him reach success and recognition in the scene over the years. It seems kind of silly to care so much about an internet figure/gamer but the longer I've followed him, I became really fond of Doublelift as a player and a person beyond just LCS - it was really heartwarming to know that he had sort of reconciled with his family recently, that's how much I've grown to care for him, and I would never want to wish this news on anybody, but knowing his story/background makes this even more horrifying and heartbreaking for me to hear about my favorite player.\n\nI just wish there was something more I could do for him, but as a fan not personally connected to him, all I can really do is let him know that him and his family will be in my thoughts. I just sincerely hope he gets the support and love he needs during this time. Please, above all else, just remember to take care of yourself Peter...",

            "comment": "For those on /r/All \n\nDoublelift is a undoubtedly one of the most popular pro League of Legends player in North America. He plays the ADC role for Team Liquid. His story is absolutely inspiring. You can watch him talk about his rough upbringing [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XQQhrssnBY&amp;feature=youtu.be). If you don't want to spend 7 minutes watching it, I can summarize it a bit.\n\nHis parents never really believed that he had a future in gaming. They were a strict and fully expected him to follow in their footsteps. After butting heads endlessly, they essentially kicked him out of their house, leaving him homeless. He was forced to live with a friend, making almost no money at the time. But even after he saw some huge success and had a stable income as a pro gamer, he still had no contact with his parents. Here are some particularly relevant quotes from the video.\n\n&gt; - [0:08] (https://youtu.be/2XQQhrssnBY?t=8s) \"I haven't verbally spoken to my parents, no. For two years.\"\n\nWhen trying to get his parents to let him go to a big gaming event in Sweden, he said\n \n&gt; - [1:15](https://youtu.be/2XQQhrssnBY?t=1m15s) \"I finally got my older brother...to try and convince my parent's that it was ok...and he helped me out.\" \n\nThis is the brother who he is talking about in the tweet that committed the heinous acts. \n\n&gt; - [5:10](https://youtu.be/2XQQhrssnBY?t=5m10s) \"Yeah, I miss my brothers sometimes. Uhh...I think my older brother is the most influential figure in my life.\" \n\n&gt; - [6:10](https://youtu.be/2XQQhrssnBY?t=6m10s) \"I just wanna go back to them and just like...just be their son one day, ya know? Just be like 'ok I'm you're son, and I'm doing well'\"\n\nThey did eventually make up. Around two years ago now, Doublift tweeted [this](https://twitter.com/tldoublelift/status/638405012951953408).\n\n&gt; Today I realized I still love my mom. Guess family really is forever, even if I spent 10  years angry with them.\n\n\nAdditionally, here's a pretty endearing [picture](https://image.ibb.co/cGO4jn/dl.png) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6rl8OuTq-8) of Doublelift with his mom. \n\nAnd if this weren't already tragic enough, Doublelift's team, Team Liquid was set to play in the NA LCS Grand Finals next Sunday. It's unclear if he is planning on playing, but I think it's safe to assume that he will not. And that is completely fine. \n\nThe entire League community is behind you, DL. Stay strong. \n",

He will decide on his own.\n\nI do wonder how Bonnie will take this. They have been together for a while and DL pretty much stated that they are serious. Very heartbreaking to watch your lover go through such conflicting times.",

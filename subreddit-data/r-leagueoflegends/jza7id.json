If that is not the case, correct me, but otherwise I think that you are missing some key points.\nVayne does not need more damage. As long as she builds attack speed, her damage will be fine because there is very, very limited counterplay to %Max HP True Damage, so not having significantly more damage is acceptable.\nThe reason why she should be stronger than before (in theory) is because of 3 reasons:\n\n1. The class she counters is the strongest in the game currently\n2. Many other ADCs that would normally counter her are significantly weaker, those who need Crit like Caitlyn.\n3. She benefits the most out of a diverse item path with more beneficial defensive options, again, because of her W's %Max HP True Damage.\n\nI myself don't think that she is much stronger than before, but it is still important to look at the other side of the coin.",

For an assassin to be viable in proplay they need to be able to one-shot squishies from a near neutral state, hence the Evelyn. Akali is a bit different due to shroud and target selection with ult so you could argue with that. But the only recent good kass performance (at least from worlds) was a blind pick from a playins team into another playins team, that team then proceeded to go winless in groups stage.",

It does more damage than it costs and with Mundo ult you have more effective hp than most opponents, so trading hp to deal damage is worth. What you actually should've done differently is used your E as an auto reset and only thrown Q between autos and moved in between autos to maximize dps (and you can move back to avoid malphite getting to auto you depending on the timing).",

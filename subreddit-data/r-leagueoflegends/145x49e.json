            "comment": "Definitely didn\u2019t doubt WE at any point in that Game 1. Nope. Marked out Kindred? Just kill\u2019em and then win. Genius stuff.\n\nWith YSKM rejoining the starting lineup, we got the interesting matchup between Cube and YSKM. As per usual YSKM was placed on his more damaged focused top laners and while YSKM\u2019s Game 1 Fiora was fearsome, it wasn\u2019t because he crushed Cube\u2019s Sion, who minimized deaths and was important in the front to back that eventually WE won with. YSKM just seemed disjointed from the team at times as in Game 2, a teleport down bot backfired when WE converged and killed him early. Not a massive performance from Cube, but we didn\u2019t need it. We didn\u2019t need it from our top laner most of the time last season; the upgrade from Biubiu is still felt and appreciated. I have to think it will come into play at some point as WE faces stiffer competition and then we\u2019ll see what Cube is really made of. Hopefully it\u2019s something strong like titanium or something.\n\nHope hasn\u2019t needed to put on the carry pants in the previous 2 series with the team winning pretty solidly as a whole up to this point, but he stepped up big time in this series. Getting the Jinx twice over Aphelios in a matchup WE seems very comfortable taking, his out scaling on that matchup was critical to WE making their Game 1 comeback, complemented great with Iwandy\u2019s Milos furthering empowering the Jinx to run rampant. Game 2 allowed Hope to once again take a back seat as Shanks re-took the reins but, man when the chips are down and Shanks has those occasional off games, it\u2019s so crucial to have that second carry in the back pocket, as Hope hasn\u2019t had any let down games to this point of the season.\n\nIt was a rookie jungler showdown and while Tianzhen had the flashy picks with a mark-empowered Kindred and signature Rengar, it was costly mistakes from the IG rookie that ultimately flipped the game. Heng did well to limit the damage of his mistakes, for the most part dodging out on Wink\u2019s hooks with well-timed Wukong clones. Game 2 was another mixed big for Heng, as there was some decent picks on an overextended Cryin and then some bad, like just dying after winning the bot lane TP teamfight and giving up a dragon basically for free. Regardless despite of the silly moments, you felt like Heng out-impacted his opponent jungler that Game 2 as the Rengar largely felt inconsequential and picked because Tianzhen saw it was open, rather than there being a plan around it. I know people have been harsh on the IG rookie, but there's talent there. It's clear that he's not ready for the big time right now, but frankly, given he was literally not allowed to resume his Pro League until this September of this year (turning 18), I think he deserves some slack. The age limit really hurts prospects like him as he's going to take his lumps with his promotion.\n\nShanks meanwhile had his biggest struggle thus far this season in Game 1, getting picked a few times and having some really poor Gragas moments, including missing Everfrost on Ahn pointblank and an ult that likely saved YSKM down bot. Still he kept his head in the game and ultimately was the one to crucially pick off Tianzhen\u2019s Kindred to get WE back into the game. While I asked for him to win all the MVPs, I wouldn't have given the honor to him for that game, but whateves. The Jayce in Game 2 was a return to form for Shanks who seemed more in his element on a more damage centered champion. Killing basically everyone in sight, whether it\u2019s YSKM on his bot TP, Cryin\u2019s Annie up top, YSKM again down bot, or basically everybody in teamfights, it was a clinic for my favorite mid laner and he rightfully won MVP for his Game 2 dominance.\n\n__________________\nYou can still argue that WE hasn\u2019t played anyone, and I would agree with you. We won\u2019t get to see it until Week 4 at the earliest however, and even then they don\u2019t get the biggest challengers off of the break. Apparently they\u2019re off because WE is representing the region for some Asian Games pre-event? I don\u2019t really know what that entails but happy trails to the team and I\u2019m eagerly waiting watching the team in a week or so.",

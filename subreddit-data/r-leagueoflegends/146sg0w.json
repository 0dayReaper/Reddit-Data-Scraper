There's no shortage of ideas and I does not seem THAT difficult to  create.  \n\n\nEven Dota 2, with fewer fundings / players and more barriers to entry, manages somehow to create a better experience. It's almost as if the new-player experience for LoL is a project that's been passed from team to team since the beginning of the game, but no one's been working on it or is willing to do so.  \n\n\n**Would it be possible to get an official answer on the challenges involved to understand why it seems so difficult?**",

That is it. \n\nNow, why they don't have separate optional tutorials you can play through for some rewards that go into specifics is beyond me.",

That could be huge.   \n**- Too much too learn**: you could implement half game half tutorial in SR after the Summonner Rift or even replace it. You would play but an vocal assistant pre-recorded could help you understand the basic of the game / or what to do not do. Features with uplifting message could also help the feeling.  \n**- For incentives:** it's more on the feeling / pipeline experience. Some people don't get you can have free skins, etc.  \n\\- **Smurfs / Toxicity:** toxicity is well reduced thanks to their policy and smurf is the biggest problem. However smurf with new players is even a worst experience than a regular player. As a regular player, you at least understand what's going on, you just getting shitstomp. As a new player, you're literally submerged with too much information and the *feeling* that you could never achieve this level / the game is not made for you. It's not the same problem at all. Ideally, system could be implemented to measure you click rate / how you move etc / =&gt; put in a AI =&gt; build a program detection =&gt; if you click too well / move too well etc =&gt; you're match with normal players.  \n\n\n\\- No monitoring: it's not normal for a game to have to find people in a subreddit or a discord. You could have functions to find it in the client. Dota 2 has a mentorining function. Dota 2, the game with less than 500 000 players...  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, if new players say the experience sucks, it means it sucks. LoL does have a pretty big barrier to entry, and I feel the pipeline new player experience isn't well thought at all.",

Yet the game isn't anywhere near as popular with under 20 year old players as it once was and less than 5% of the playerbase are new players.\n\nDo you understand what this means?\n\nIf not [here's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid) a helpful article about population demographics and how they develop over time. Tldr as people get older they will have less time to play due to real world commitments (e.g. work, children, spouses, aging relatives) and unless you replace those players your population is going to decline over time. The fact that the players who have played less than 6+ years is smaller than those who have played for more than 6 years makes league age pyramid top heavy (population decline over time).",

If you would, you would not be in Iron.\n\nIf you are in Iron after 9 years most of the following will apply to you :\n\nyou dont ward enough, you die too much, you have no map awareness, your itemization is bad, your farming is bad, your mechanics are bad, you play too many champions, you play too many roles, you play bad champions",

Here's a video explaining this in detail so you can have a head start: youtube.com/somethingsomething\".

And since he's Iron He certainly IS BAD, He is at the very bottom of the ladder, He is bad for a fact and If I we're in his Shoes I'd say im bad myself.\n\nHe can be good in comparison to his teammates, He can be good considering his time played or whatever but He's been playing it for 9 years and cannot get out of Iron so unless He starts changing his mindset and his gameplay, he's certainly going to stay there.\n\nDo you really think after 9 years he didn't watch any Videos about it? Or doesn't Bring in some experience of DotA, HoN, etc? He claimed so many solutions to be wrong, If he can't Accept that he's not as good as he thinks he is, he wont improve.\n\nI am Dia and I could improve in these aspects aswell. Why can't he? Should I cuddle him beforehand? You think this is going to Help now? Guess not. Most likely He knows some stuff, what hes got to do but he can't perform it in a Match, Decisions take way too Long, he can't execute His knowledge in a practical Match.",

Also you don't need to cuddle him, why do you feel the need to go from one extreme to another? I legit only said there is a nicer way of going about trying to help him, I don't see why that's so difficult to swallow. \n\nAnd yes he most likely will never improve because in his mind he is far better than he actually is, but telling him he sucks won't change that, especially judging by his attitude here, he will just turn away and not take your advice seriously. But now he is in a shittier mood for it. \n\nConstructive criricism and helpful advice doesn't need to be rude to be effective, that's my whole point.",

Theres people who need that. Theres people who need to be \"cuddled\" and Theres people that need to be clapped. And whatever your answer May be, this is a fact and it's being taught to teachers in how to teach people, especially younger ones. When I get a Trainee i'll watch His Attitude and considering his personality im either going to tell him \"He could do better If ...\" Or \"This is Bad, Go fix it right now.\" Some people need that and you can go read it up yourself: \n\nextrinsic motivational Type \nIntrinsic motivational Type \n\nthey wont be motivated If you dont slightly kick their Asses. I was a little harsh and thats on purpose. Cuddling and telling him it'll be better one day wont help after 9 years. \n\nBut hey, who am I to Tell you that, I just learned it during my Engineering Masters Study in which I needed to complete my instructor aptitude test and I've had success with it when performing it.",

What role do you play? \n\nMain advice is to play a greedy ass champ that can bully, learn to farm like a madman, and don't chase anything unless you are certain you kill them and live and you're not missing more gold by chasing than you do by staying and getting minions and tower plates. \n\nIron players don't get ahead. Stay and get waves when they roam at a bad time. Make sure your waves aren't pushed in before starting an objective. \n\n\nIf you link your op.gg or just list your summoner name and server we can take a look at your champ pool and match history and see if there's anything that sticks out. \n\n\nHope you have a good day!",

That's a LOT of characters and in many differing play styles. \n\nFind one or two champs to focus on and only play those champs, at least in ranked. \n\n\n\nI'm a nasus mid one trick so I can offer some help on him but honestly the folks over at r/nasusmains are more on the pulse. \n\nIf you are picking your champ for the game based off of what your team or the enemy is picking, stop that. You playing a champ you know and can pilot consistently is far more important.",

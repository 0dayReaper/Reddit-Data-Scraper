    "postText": "I've been playing League of Legends for the past 8 months, and to be honest, I'm finding it difficult to break out of the bronze rank. I've been struggling to improve my gameplay, and it's starting to feel a bit disheartening.\n\nHonestly, as a girl in the League community, I sometimes feel like I face additional challenges. The toxicity can be overwhelming at times, and it makes me question if I truly belong here. But I refuse to let that discourage me! I know there are many incredible female players out there who have overcome similar obstacles, and I want to learn from your \n\nWhat advice do you have for someone like me, who is passionate about the game but feels stuck in bronze? How can I improve my skills, navigate the toxicity, and rise above the challenges? I'm open to any suggestions, whether it's related to champion picks, macro strategies, mental fortitude, or fostering a supportive community!!",

            "comment": "Unless you're playing all the time Bronze within the first 8 months isn't a bad rank. Half my friends didn't really even play ladder for almost the first year they played. The most important thing I feel is the approach to ranked. You might be aware of this already, but to further emphasize this because this is important, approach to ladder absolutely has to be with the goal to IMPROVE little by little, rather than to win and get LP. If you get into a game with the mentality that you're trying to do one or two little things better than you've done last game(pick whatever. a little better cs-ing, dodging abilites, rotation time, pay more attention to map etcetcetc) and try to not look at winning as the goal -- you can even disregard it completely. It's far less furstrating to have you motivation to win as part of respect your ranked team rather than your own ambition for immediate rise in rank -- you will not get dissuaded. Focus everything on improving. If after the game you felt like you played slightly better than last game, which should be your main goal, and you WILL acomplish this guaranteed although the degree of which you improve in each game varies of course..  you succeeded. Instead of setting your goal for getting Silver in 2 weeks, either don't set any rank goal at all because your goal should really be to IMRPOVE and not reach a ceratin rank, I do know not everyone has the same mentality and even if this works for some people this may not work for others, if you want or need to set a rank goal, instead give a much hugher time frame with higher rank in the end, like 3 months for Gold or even a year for Plat, this way you're alletivating pressure from superficial things like reaching a certain rank fast and can focus more of your attention on improving between each game. Like if you go on a loss streak it doesn't matter at all, because if you improve as a player you'll certainly get all that elo back and much it's a fact.\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of practical advice it's difficult to give without you providing on what role and champion you play. The easiest advice I can give is people in Bronze make mistakes all the time, heck people in plat and diamond make mistakes all the time as well, and in bronze it's just in massive increase in volume.. The easiest thing you can do is be patient until the opponent screws up royally with either a bad tower dive, an awful dragon/baron call where you can wipe them or even just a very poor decision to engage which results in an opponent missing some simple dash ability into multiple members in which you held your cc ability for that opportunity, then win the map after since it's now a 5v4.",

This game can be based in only 1 condition, and it's being mechanically good, how do u become mechanically good? By spamming the same champion 100 times, with that u literally can reach platinum without much difficulty. I experienced that a lot of my friends play 80 champions in soloq and they are mad cuz can't get out of silver\n\nif u have any questions add from EUW: miata jg",

I played AP Zac support for \u224870% of my games, and if I got autofilled in top, jg, or mid, I would still play Zac (tho sometimes tank depending on the matchup). if I got filled in adc, I would just dodge if no one wanted to swap.\n\nfind your favorite champion, and one trick it.\n\nas for dealing with toxicity\u2026 I definitely got a lot of it as a Zac support player. lots of people thought I was trolling, inting, or was just outright regarded. they had a lot to say whenever I died, but nothing to say when I played well.\n\nreally there\u2019s only 2 things you can do - take it in stride and ignore it, or just mute them the second they say something negative. personally, if someone was being really toxic to me, I would egg them on and then report them after the game. I wouldn\u2019t say anything mean, but any time they died I would be like \u201cLMFAO\u201d and stuff to that effect. I\u2019ve gotten several toxic people permabanned like that lol. \n\ntruthfully, most of the community is actually pretty decent, it\u2019s just that humans have a bias to remember the handful of times when things got truly toxic. if people are being toxic, just mute and play with pings only. \n\nrespectfully, I get the feeling that you really want to chat with players in the game, which is why the toxicity bothers you more than it does most other people. if you\u2019re playing ranked, you\u2019re going to encounter competitive people who want to win at all costs and don\u2019t care about chatting. \n\nlastly, you could always play ARAM which is what I do these days. I encounter toxic players maybe once every 50 games and the games are over in under 20 mins. there are quite a few people who chat too and the vibes are a lot more chill than in ranked.",

Can't tell you how often someone has a crazy skin and I have no idea who they are until I check. It's been that way for a while to be honest. Riot kind of abandoned the whole clarity thing a while back. \n\nI remember when one of the Ahri skins came out the community went crazy asking them to change the color of her Q to match the skin. But riot responded that abilities needed to look the same for clarity's sake, because if you don't instantly recognize the model you should instantly recognize their abilities. That went out the window at some point though, clearly.",

Omnistone itself works great with cho since you'll get predator a good amount of the time and cho actually wants to auto to use his E so the ones like PTA/HoB/Lethal Tempo are still somewhat decent. Phase rush is nice, aftershock is nice, grasp is nice, aery is ok, comet is ok, fleet is ok (cool if you get it while jungling since it's the only runethat can proc while doing camps), conq kinda sucks except in really weird scenarios but sacrifices must be made. Glacial can start being good after you complete a slow item, either glp, twin shadows, or righteous, I don't know which item is better in the jungle tbh.",

It's ridiculous. \n\n\nEven if you're going full AP I'd recommend taking Cinderhulk by the way. You get so much HP off of your R, and you're going to be building a lot of hybrid AP/HP items, so you get a tonne of value out of it.

Glad he made it to LA without any hitches, unfortunate he won't play week one but excited to see how he meshes with the team during week 2.",

I could understand if they kept Maple because they want to mayne move him to China as well but there's no way in hell they're ever going to think about bringing Ruby to LPL.\n\nIt just really shows how different TSM is now that everybody's gone. Just a braindead soulless corporate organisation with no face. For some reason whoever is making these decisions thinks that they'll retain more fans coming 8th with a nobody Korean, rather than maybe 9th with a resident mid.",

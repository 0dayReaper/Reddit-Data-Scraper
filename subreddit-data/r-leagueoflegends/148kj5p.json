If it's not on, I don't play, thus no support for the company with any types of purchases. Overall seems like a loss for them, am I just one of many with such a perspective? Undoubtedly so",

ARURF is considerably higher than ARAM  \n3. ARURF matches are 1.5-2x faster than TFT (usually 20 vs 40 minutes) and yet averaged more play hours, meaning that players not only opted into spending *more time* playing ARURF than TFT, but they also chose to play *more matches* within that daily time spent -- which means that while having the ability to choose to stop playing after a smaller period of time had they disliked the experience, they decided to *continue* and queue for more games, clearly liking their experience.  \n    \nWas your smug reply pretending to make a point against URF/ARURF? Cuz it ain't lol",

It basically makes it so that you now have a chance to be the ONLY team with a carry champ or the ONLY team without one. Any Rapid Fire game mode will be that way and since it is inherently more focused on specific champs than comps, it will always fall back to the same issue. If you wanted this, you would need to make the champion pool be ONLY the \"broken\" champs so that everyone has a fair time, but how much do you want to bet all of those will always be perfectly balanced?",

Which looks as though there really is no enthusiasm for anything of the like within riot. I always found that it was fun and challenging to work together with randoms or friends to overcome these broken champs. I think most of the time if it was truly balanced compared to its previous/current state, more % of games wouldn't just be a broken champ fest. I also find there is so much synergy of the weaker champs when they group together. But overall the complexities of why one team having an edge over the other is why league is so fun, and it really is never the same each game",

Aram has similar balance issues (see when all assassins would just build heartsteel) but it benefits from the fact that the broken person has to go fight 5 other people. URF has the same balance problem without the check of forced team fights. If URF was constant, you would have URF smurfs, who would just play the broken/mobile champs. There would end up with a champ pool of like 20 people that could be considered \"viable\" with nothing else being good. Often those champs are high mobility bruisers or assassins. At that point, with only 20 champs, its a question of did the enemy pick the hard counter or not.\n\nIt's fine to hope, but permanent URF would quickly become the least fun, sweatiest mode, and would directly lead to a drop in player base. In current rotations, we reach that point after about a month.",

Assuming you have 1 developer, who you can pay the least amount possible, who can not only analyze the ENTIRE champ pool, but also develop balance updates, and implement them with patch notes without the position having crazy burn out (none of those assumptions are realistic), then your number is $81,650 that Urf would need to bring in Annually to establish a worhtwhile profit margin. But realistically, you have a range of pay rates for different levels of experience and likely will need a minimum of 3 people to complete these tasks (likely more).\n\nAll of a sudden, URF alone needs to bring in almost 500K annually to even be profitable. You said ARURF helps balance the monotony of the game mode? Good luck selling skins to people who can't even guarantee they get to play the champ they just spent money on. Riot would be lowering the marketability of their product (skin sales) by utilizing ARURF at all, which makes that profit point harder to hit.\n\nBut you're now asking questions that no one can answer, you stopped looking for valid input as soon as you saw the first comment. You like URF, cool. I hope you enjoy it the next time it comes back! But asking more questions isn't going to make it a better monetization of LoL. See every other comment for why.",

Not ideal by far, but it's better than blind pick urf in its current state obviously. Theoretically we won't know what a proper balanced &amp; tuned URF mode would do to the economics &amp; player base of the game until it actually comes to fruition, which looks more than unlikely. So its great to brainstorm and hear the thoughts on the subject  \n\n\nThe thing is I just wanted to voice my only perspective on the game as there is not much conversations out there on the agenda. Cheers for the elaborate input, appreciate it",

Of course a Patreon won't just simply support his team but at least it's a more honest and simple approach for now.",

They were \"burned\" by promises not kept and they aren't going to open their wallets again for the same deal. \n\nIn essence, e-sports blew their one shot and they dropped the ball. The money was so flush, the teams thought the money train was never going to end. Teams expanded into other e-sports thinking they could just rinse and repeat their winning formula. Well, they killed the golden goose and the money train ended.",

So much potential monetization venues have been ignored in favor of other (easier?) revenue streams like sponsorships and VC. This is partly on Riot (why the hell are team icons, emotes, chromas, banners, etc so unavailable in game?) and on teams. \n\nI've been following esports closely for years now, and there's only a handful of times I've actually bought something from a team - a bunch of Flyquest jerseys because the org's jersey artist was really really good at making beautiful designs + their sustainability stuff, and CLG jersey from their 2016 run because I really liked the way it looked. 100T for some reason gets flak for being a hoodie org, but why are teams slacking so hard on merch and content? It doesn't even have to be clothes, things from patches, stickers etc could all go some way to building a solid fanbase even if it might  not be a huge moneymaker.\n\nEven some sort of subscription on Twitch or something for emotes, it doesn't have to be like a Patreon.",

The reason why every org is fucked is because of their reliance of sponsor money and the lack of revenue streams with some orgs being the exception because they have alternative revenue. \n\nSure, LCS orgs oversold themselves. I don't blame them, that's always going to be the case when you're pitching to sponsors/investors/VC. \n\nYou're going to sell big numbers and the appeal of winning worlds and having the sponsor's name in front of the world and how you're going to use the money to build the strongest team to do so. That's their only selling point.\n\n\"But if we told the investors that if we invested in NACL we would have NA Faker, NA Uzi\" The investors could be high on crack and that would still be nothing compared to the amount of copium Reddit has about the potential of NACL. \n\nInvestors aren't exactly going to be jumping at the opportunity to part with their money if you told them they're investing in a league that gets 4k~ concurrent viewers and 11k~ views content video.\n\nOne of Toast's selling points to sponsors is that his team does have a bigger presence in terms of views and interactions compared to LCS orgs which is valid, even if you aren't the best as long as you have an big audience that in itself is appealing to potential sponsors.\n\nIMO LCS should have focused on developing personalities over trying to win worlds or be a competitive region.\n\nThe problem with this is that the new gen NA league players don't have a brand and they aren't actively developing one for one reason or another that's not entirely their fault (they personally aren't interested, orgs not promoting them, fanbase is toxic af etc.).\n\nName the biggest three new gen NA league pro players in recent times: Blaber, Danny and Jojopyun.\n\nFeel free to put in whoever's name you want to replace Danny. I guaratee you their brand is a fraction compared to the old gen league players, QT, DL, Scarra, Sneaky, IWD and that's not including league streamers at any point in time past, present and future.\n\nWould you even actively remember/follow the new gen players if they retired from league? I doubt it.\n\nThe issue is more than just sponsorship money and developing talent.",

Competitive success doesn't really translate to bringing in many new viewers, it mostly just helps bring old viewers back. It's mostly a question of if people think international success or interesting personalities would bring in more viewers, though knowing how NA works as a region, I believe the latter would result in more viewers.\n\nBlaber and Jojo are pretty much the prime examples, since Blaber is basically native star in NA right now, likely ahead of DL currently, but who actually cares? It's really only the real diehard C9 fans who care. When I asked my friend (who barely watches LCS) who he's excited to watch, he told me Berserker. When I asked him about Blaber, he said \"I'm excited to watch him int.\" While I don't think many other casual fans have that reaction, it also shows Blaber isn't very interesting to follow either, despite his 4 years of domestic dominance. Then there's Jojo, who I guess is interesting for people who follow his Twitter, but only people already in the scene know about his tweets. The story of a new NA mid is really only interesting for those already watching LCS, to casual fans that isn't really a reason to watch LCS.",

Like, okay, let's assume NA LCS and NACL are run by complete incompetent clowns who stumbled their way upwards.\n\nThen what about LCK? Are LCK run by teams and organizations who have no idea what they're doing and they're also a bunch of clowns? Because as of right now, even LCK teams aren't profitable. T1 Wolf even said it, LCK is in a bit of trouble and he was even surprised Brion managed to find a sponsor. Yeah they're no T1 or GENG but even GENG wasn't profitable. \n\nThere's a clear issue with the league ecosystem. Never mind the fact that sponsors and VC funding drying up is also due to economic issues that LCS teams have no control over.\n\nIs LCK's development league in the dumps? No they're producing talent, but the league still isn't profitable and teams aren't profitable. Even if we were to assume NACL was pumping out mini-Bjergs and mini-Doublielifts every split, would that automatically make every team profitable? There's a profitability issue and a sustainability issue in Riot's competitive structure. Korean orgs kept competitive SC;BW alive for so long Blizzard literally had to kill it to force a transition to mainstream competitive SC2 - and look how that ended up turning out. It's almost like developers don't necessarily know how to create a sustainable competitive esports scene, but Riot wants a stronghold on everything so they won't allow anything else.\n\nEdit: The bulk of sports teams' revenues comes from broadcasting revenue/rights. Riot only allowing their own sanctioned events kneecaps how much organizations could make from that because they only have two splits and two international events. Riot either needs to hold more events and matches to have more ad spots to sell in order to raise total broadcasting revenue, or they need to allow independent tournaments at the risk of franchised teams participating in other tournaments. It's more nuanced than lmao NA LCS orgs are stupid. Riot is just as culpable for the shitstorm that's come up.\n\nEdit 2: A bit ironic people are eager to shed Riot of any culpability in their lack of interest in the competitive scene while the post about lolesports.com being dogshit is the top post of the sub. Totally the behavior of a commissioner's office that cares a LOT about the competitive scene. Like the NBA commissioner's office gets praised for what they've done since David Stern. The MLB commissioner's office gets shit on because they don't know what the fuck they're doing and don't know how to market the game in the modern age. Baseball fans aren't shitting on the Angels, Orioles, or Pirates for not marketing the game. When ESPN tried to shit on Mike Trout for saying he's the face of baseball that no one knows about because he has no social media presence and personality, the public shit back on them because that's his personal choice and it's the MLBs fault that they can't market - not the players. Meanwhile, so many people on this sub are just completely immune to blaming Riot for being a shitty commissioners office, and go so far as to blaming the players for not being social media personalities. Holy shit.\n\nEdit 3: Some of you guys are way too lost in the sauce as if you guys are Tencent shareholders. How were teams supposed to budget around a global economic crisis? Are teams supposed to employ a team of economic forecasters to gauge how much VC funding and sponsorship marketing budgets are going to be? The discourse around Riot's responsibility around a product they control 100% of is kinda laughable. Some of you mother fuckers are really out there being like it's because LCS doesn't have a \"Lebron\" whos good and holds labor power as if that's even how collective bargaining and labor power works. You guys really took what someone like Dom said a couple years ago about how league popularity was going down because people don't have personalities like Sneaky and Dlift did, and took that to heart, without realizing how in the realm of physical sports, that kind of take would get laughed at and it did get laughed at. Every collective sports fanbase understands that when something shitty is going on in a league, it's the commissioners office fault",

People are just saying look it's because NA has no success when there's clearly a bigger systemic issue at play and it's that Riot just doesn't care about the competitive scene. I don't get how people have such a cognitive dissonance about Riot and Riot being a terrible commissioners office. Yeah sure they're not officially a commissioner, but they act in that role. In any other sport, the commissioner is the one that gets the shit for league-wide issues, not the teams. \n\nDid teams spend exorbitantly? Yeah, but there's also outside economic factors at play that led to projected revenues being slashed and orgs having to cut spending. And why are people suddenly acting like Riot has acted in the best interest of the competitive scene, when they have never displayed their attitude to do so. They simply don't care. \n\nPeople are just casually knocking off the fact LCK is having financial issues too. Their academy players are on minimum wage salaries, and they're still having trouble too. Clearly it's not just a NA bad thing, but I guess because it's the simplest and easiest conclusion to draw, people just parrot whatever the fuck doublelift or dom says about it. \n\nIt's just impossible to have any nuanced discussion about this when people won't even concede the fact that Riot has been a shitty commissioner and the fact that Riot also having a profit motive in League creates a conflict of interest with the competitive scene.",

No, they designed the board and put the development into it. But are they shafting their partners and other organizations that were part of the ecosystem? Yeah. EVGA - one of the most reputable board manufacturers - straight up said they're unable to profit because of Nvidia's pricing structure in a time when the GPU market was having a boom. And at the end of the day who gets shafted? The average consumer like you and I. \n\nIn league's case, Riot is the only one making a fuckton of money while also acting as the commissioner of the league.

LCK teams were paying players extremely small salaries, League-minimum or just over, and these teams started offering these players multi-million dollar a year contracs.\n\nLCK still doesn't pay as much as LPL/NA, or even the bigger teams in LEC, but it definitely pays a lot better than it did. China/NA started the salary wars and started offering such huge contracts, and LCK had to keep up or lose.",

Why not? Let the teams organize however they want, let them participate in any tournament they want, and etc. It's like if the inventor of basketball decided only he could decide who can play competitive basketball and any other televised tournament was illegal. \n\nThat's essentially what Riot is doing it. By the letter of the law is it right? Sure, but laws are imperfect. Riot wants to own the whole competitive ecosystem and expects the organizations to find profitability within the confines they've set. Imagine if there could be another tournament with a bunch of sponsors that want to see the most popular players and teams play from across the world. Nope, can't do that because Riot won't allow it. The bulk of any sports teams' revenue comes from broadcasting rights. Why? Because ad spots are hot. With Riot's ecosystem, there is only so many opportunities for that ad revenue.\n\nThat's why even LCK teams are having trouble. You don't think those organizations could sell a bunch of ad spots to a tournament where they privately organize and invite whichever teams they want? \n\nRiot wanted to have their cake and eat it too. They wanted sole control over the competitive scene in case it blew up into this huge thing, but also only ever saw the competitive scene as a marketing expense that they don't want to increase spending on. \n\nThat's all to bring it back to your original point. Even with well planned teams and experience there is in the LCK, they're having trouble with profitability. Regardless of whether or not the individual LCS orgs spent their money stupidly, profitability in an ecosystem that has only a limited amount of ad spots due to Riot's monopolistic tendencies was always going to be a difficult thing. If Riot isn't going to let orgs have some independence in how they want to operate in the competitive scene, then yes, they should eat the cost since they're making a fuckton of money anyway.",

That's their safety net.  It wasn't Riot that made teams spend a disproportionate and unsustainable amount of money on player salary.  It wasn't Riot that made teams do fuck-all with the money they got from investors.\n\nWith Riot's ecosystem?  What?  Riot is not Youtube.  They are not Twitch.  Traditional sports teams sell their broadcasting rights to regional and national broadcasting networks.  Who is Riot supposed to sell to?  Youtube and Twitch aren't buying.  ESPN or Spectrum are not paying for League of Legends broadcasting rights when it can be watched for free on Twitch and Youtube.  Riot doesn't have leverage.  The most they can do is threaten to broadcast exclusively on another platform if they aren't paid but then they're cutting off a huge amount of their own viewership which hurts the viewership metrics used to attract sponsors.  At least Riot has a fighting chance to implement actual broadcasting rights in e-sports, though.  If all their games become successful, they can threaten to pull them all from a platform and that would actually be a real threat.  Individual teams stand no chance.\n\nRiot is already eating the cost via revenue sharing.  If this was just like any other tournament, unless it's an invitational with pay-outs, the tournament runner doesn't just revenue share that with the teams.  They take that money and put a part of it into the prize pool.  That's how it's paid out.  If you don't win, then you get fucked financially.  That has never been a sustainable e-sports model.\n\nThe best you could argue is that the revenue is not just sponsorship and viewership revenue.  It's also the added revenue e-sports and its teams generate for League of Legends itself and that should also be included within the revenue sharing model.  I think that's a legitimate ask but it's hard to really quantify how much money that really is.\n\nIf you want open tournaments, then you can't have franchising and you can't have a revenue sharing league model unless teams somehow have leverage and they don't.  Why would Riot agree to split their revenue with teams when teams can just go play anywhere they want to?  It dilutes the league in a myriad of ways.  If an NBA team wanted to go play games in the Euroleague or CBA, you can be sure as hell there would be major issues with the NBA.\n\nWith the league and franchising model, sponsors invest into the league and that money is then proportionately distributed to the teams.  It gives sponsors a more legitimate, reputable, financially stable front-facing company that they can more reliably invest into (Riot).  It also gives the teams legitimacy by association.  \n\nLCK teams are not having trouble because of any of the shit you mentioned.  They're having trouble because players are now making gigantic salaries due to years of irresponsible poaching from the LCS and LPL.  If you want to blame Riot for something, blame them for not implementing an international salary cap system.  But, legally, that would be a nightmare to do so they've left it to the individual leagues to handle.",

Thinking the whole competitive scene can be buoyed by ad sales through just the two domestic leagues and two international tournaments (which for the most part only have a few really high value slots) is Riot's fault. \n\nJust boiling it down to \"teams should just be less stupid\" just completely absolves Riot of the fact that they have for the most part neglected the competitive scene and have set up a terrible competitive structure that limits how many ads they can sell and how many high value slots they have, which is the most important revenue stream for sports organizations. \n\nRiot is league. They own everything. Organizations can't fold from the LCS/LCK/LPL and form a new league. Riot is the one that ultimately has all the power. Riot's inaction speaks just as much - it just says they only see the competitive scene as a marketing expense, which is why they're indifferent to the general direction of the scene. Riot is basically the commissioner, and from what I've seen since, they've been a shitty commissioner. And that's to be expected because Riot itself is an entity and has a separate profit motive. Except that essentially creates a relationship where the league is beholden to how benevolent corporate Riot wants to be. Imagine if on top of the NBA teams, the commissioner's office was owned by Google. Google has a profit motive and would inevitably want a return off of what the actual teams are making. That essentially creates a toxic relationship between the commissioner's office and the teams because their goals aren't aligned anymore. Which is why in other sports, the commissioner's office is seen as the public facing puppet for the team owners. Riot inherently can't act like that, so their goals aren't aligned with the organizations unless Riot wants to. Instead of the commissioner of league being an organizing voice and a collective figure of the team owners, they're the ones holding the leash",

How are you supposed to sell something that is free?\n\nI don't get why you think that's what I suggested. I'm talking about ad space. Ad space that broadcasts have. When TV networks buy broadcast rights, it's because they want to sell ad space. Riot is the network because they control the whole broadcast. \n\n&gt; It's not only on Riot to increase the marketability of their game. It's also on the teams and players to increase the marketability of themselves.\n\nSure, but that still has nothing to do with the fact that revenue streams in league are still unsustainable and inconsistent. Do you think the Lakers can run profitably just off of Lebron jersey sales? The NBA  actually markets the league. What has Riot done besides when they want to sell tickets to Worlds?\n\n&gt; Riot has already put out an extremely popular, genre leading global game. What have the LCS players done in comparison? Have they made the LCS an extremely popular, e-sports leading global league? lmao. If every team was as popular as T1 and all the players were as marketable as Faker, then Riot would also have a much easier time selling sponsorships.\n\nOkay, that has nothing to do with that. Is T1 profitable then? Wolf said T1 was in the red and the whole league is having a hard time. Is Riot also not in charge of LCK? And using Faker is like saying why couldn't every NBA team have a Michael Jordan. It's a disingenuous argument that completely misses the point of everything I previously explained to you. Like great Riot created a fun game. That doesn't mean they know how to create an esports league. Blizzard, a F500 company with more legitimacy than Riot couldn't do jack shit. They ruined every competitive scene they tried to mingle in.\n\n&gt; The most important revenue stream for a sports organization is their broadcasting rights because that is essentially their IP. That's their product. But, in esports, they can't sell that.\n\nAgain they can't do that, but who has control of the broadcast. Riot does. That's the whole goddamn point. There isn't enough ad slots in the current competitive structure that Riot has created. There just isn't enough ad slots. \n\n&gt; Ultimately, that doesn't really matter. It just means that because there is less revenue due to not being able to sell broadcasting rights, there is less money to spend on the team. Whereas the NBA revenue sharing is split from billions of dollars, it just means League of Legends will be much lower so team operating costs and player salaries will be proportionately lower -- reportedly still a few million dollars a year per team.\n\nYes it does matter because I'm pretty sure Riot gave rosy projections when they proposed franchising. Ad slots are where the big money is spent. The fact that there is a lack of ad slots due to the structure of competitive league isn't something to just glance over. If you think otherwise, by all means, continue to believe that. \n\n&gt; If teams and players simply spent within their means as dictated by the revenue sharing amount, they would've never had any financial issues. The problem is that they took more investor money and was spending beyond their actual means.\n\nNo the problem is due to global economic circumstances, belts were tightened. When budgets are slashed, marketing budgets are cut first. When the Fed increased interest rates, VC funding as a whole was cut. Their risk tolerance becomes a bit lower and prioritize investments that have a shorter timeline to profitability. If not being able to predict all of that is the organizations' faults, sure. But companies don't operate and budget around once in a lifetime events\n\n&gt; That's the fault of the teams and players. Not Riot. Today, if T1 said they were quitting league and Faker went on a media run doing interviews blasting Riot, do you think Riot wouldn't feel pressure? Riot might lose the business of the entirety of Korea overnight.\n\nLol. If you don't think Riot holds all the leverage because they literally own the fucking intellectual property, I don't know what the fuck to tell you. \n\n&gt; Instead, the best the LCS can do is what? C9 threatening to quit the LCS? DL blasting Riot? That would barely register as a mosquito bite to Riot.\n\n Again neither hold real power because Riot has ownership of everything League related. What you're describing is PR campaigns to have boycotts. Those are two different things. Why are you even using these bad faith arguments instead of actually arguing my points off of economic theory. \n\n&gt; When the NBA negotiates their collective bargaining agreement, it is because the players have power that they can ask for concessions. It is because when international superstars like LeBron James deny you their labor, you are losing millions of dollars. Power is not given, it is earned. \n\nCongratulations. You described a union and what a union does. Except its a bit different because legally, Lebron could go and start another basketball league if the NBA team owners don't make concessions. Labor holds power in that situation because they have the ability of choice. Riot owns league. No one can legally produce and broadcast a League of Legends tournament without Riot's approval. There is no ability of choice for labor here.",

Riot. \n\nLet me ask you this, when EVGA publicly denounced NVIDIA's shitty business practices and announced they would no longer be manufacturing GPUs because NVIDIA is making it impossible to run it profitably, were you questioning why EVGA wasn't cutting costs and paying staff lower wages and outsourcing to cheaper countries? NVIDIA is legally well within their rights to do whatever the fuck they want because they own the property and IP, right? MSI, ASUS, and EVGA should just get good? Except that's not the response that the PC industry had. Everyone collectively shit on NVIDIA for being greedy.\n\nI outlined the reasons why I think Riot fucked up and why they're at fault. I explained why the structure in which Riot is also the commissioner of the league creates conflicting profit motives. \n\nI explained that Riot's inaction speaks just as much about how much they care about the competitive scene and what they view the competitive scene as. Just a marketing tool. If Apple all of a sudden bought the universal rights to basketball, do you think the NBA would be a better product or a worse product? Apple will want to extract value out of the league, whereas in the current NBA system, the commissioner is completely parallel to the team owners and act as the collective figurehead.",

But because they never won, they just kept going and going because it was the only way to remain sorta competitive (Everyone memes the 3-3 finishes, but that's still 50% win rate). So now we're sorta stuck because 'at the moment'  we need to import to stay sorta competitive and nobody wants to take the L and invest in the future in fear of falling behind.",

Your profit and loss statement for your outputs include non cash movement and that could show a net loss for the financial year, even if you're not spending more than you earn. The reverse can also be true\n\nFor example, if you use the revaluation method for some PPE, and that you had a major revaluation loss during the year and no revaluation reserve from prior year to offset this revaluation loss, you would have to debit the loss to your profit and loss account and not to other comprehensive incomes. \n\nMeaning, if you had major revaluation losses during the year, you could very well be showing a loss despite having a positive cashflow during the year (I.e. making more money that what you are spending)",

It's just crazy teams overly focused on being competitive in game but didn't put more effort competitively marketing their brand more. Every opportunity means more money and they didn't take it. Fucking ridiculous so many people saw the writing on the wall but the valuations of these orgs kept going up regardless. They treated LCS like a dick measuring contest for so long but didn't even compete in the areas that would've made LCS an attractive product for sponsors and the fans.

The only reason and quite literally the only reason eSports was even popular is because the 18-34 single male demographic is THE single most difficult demographic to market towards. It turns out eSports couldn't really convert their spending in a profitable way so sponsors are pulling out.\n\nToast also brought up an important point where his views are double another eSports org's (I'm guessing EG but he left it up to the editor so no idea) and his Twitter engagement was 10x but the sponsor still said no. The numbers must just be terrible and not worth the time if 2x on views and 10x Twitter engagement doesn't get a deal.\n\nIt also coincides with less easy money and all companies having to tighten up, even the super rich, huge companies. Companies just can't spend as much on marketing and the dollars that do, aren't worth going into eSports especially since NA is very casual and have always traditionally gravitated towards console games anyways.",

I think we will see more sponsors once the market corrects itself, but the market has to be stable for sponsors to negotiate a fair deal. They too overspent on false promises.

The VC model is almost exactly this where the 2-3 supernova hits (Amazon, Facebook, etc) and like 2-3 medium hits will pay for the other 10-15 duds. The cycle has ended for the initial VC money (around 10ish years) but there\u2019s always people trying to start a new cycle.",

Most of that is probably sponsorships, viewership, and possibly ticket revenue.\n\nThat money is then split between Riot, the teams, and the players.  At least when it was originally reported, the split was 32.5% to Riot, 32.5% to teams, 35% to players.\n\nThis is fundamentally the same as a league like the NBA.  In the NBA, their CBA dictates the split between the league and players -- typically around half of basketball related income goes to the players.\n\nThe main difference is that with the NBA, they can actually sell their broadcasting rights to local, national, and international broadcasting stations.  Riot can't sell the broadcasting rights for League of Legends because Twitch and Youtube are free and nobody is paying for those rights when they can be watched for free on Twitch and Youtube.  Why would ESPN pay a lot of money for the rights to broadcast the LCS when you can legally watch it for free?\n\nBut, ultimately, that doesn't really matter.  It just means that because there is less revenue due to not being able to sell broadcasting rights, there is less revenue to share.  Whereas the NBA revenue sharing is billions of dollars, it just means League of Legends will be much lower so team operating costs and player salaries will be proportionately lower.\n\nIf teams and players simply spent within their means as dictated by the revenue sharing amount, they would've never had any financial issues.  The problem is that they took more investor money and was spending beyond their actual means.",

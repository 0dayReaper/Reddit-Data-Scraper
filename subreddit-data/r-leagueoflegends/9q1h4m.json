Afreeca was sent here to judge the fate of our region. It found a region whose teams had deviated from the Koreans' blueprints . A region where not everything has gone according to plan. Cold logic deemed our region not worth saving. Cold logic, however, does not account for the power of Sneaky in lane.\n\nIt's up to each of us to prove this is a region worth saving.\n\nThat our teams... our teams are worth cheering.",

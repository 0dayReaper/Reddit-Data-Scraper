They left the restriction because it\u2019s time gated for 3 days. Whatever.  But they fixed the Honour level. \n\nI had to appeal 3 different times.  First time I got Blitzbot, Second time Virtuoso just RPing as Jhin and not actually answering my question. Third [I forget which it was atm] sent me the chat logs. And FINALLY Manakete sorted it out.",

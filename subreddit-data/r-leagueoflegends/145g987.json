    "postText": "I have played league on and off since 2010. I absolutely love the game, and watch it all the time. However, when I play I always choose ARAM because the community is much more accepting. However, I really miss the regular game and decided to give it a try after years of avoiding it due to fear of my teammates being toxic. I played one game and even though I told them I haven\u2019t played regular in a long time, and it was an unranked game, they were very rude and threatening to report me (I had 6 deaths total in the whole game, and tried very hard not to int. Also, we won.)\n\nMy request is to have a more positive attitude when playing unranked regular games. There are those of us who feel unwelcome to even try to practice a game we love. Bot games are not the same at all, so as much as I can practice with those, I will still be rusty when I play a regular game.\n\nI totally get the frustration when you get put on a team with someone who doesn\u2019t play up to your standard, and that\u2019s okay. But if you want them to play better, constructive feedback will be more helpful than shame.",

The game is fun, but 99% of the time there's not a single useful thing in chat that can't be expressed through pings.\n\nThe game is also way more fun for me when playing with friends, I play ranked alone, but for normals I try to at least have one buddy for a duo, though 5 stacks are the best!",

But there's no point in letting them keep pinging you or talking shit. Talking shit back is just two monkeys flinging shit. Just mute and play the game.\n\nEven if you misplayed and your teammate is annoyed at you, if you mute them and play then your play will be a lot better than if you flame them back or let them flame you and get tilted and not focus on the game.",

Yes you might win an odd game here and there that was doomed by trying your best to mediate and communicate with your team, but the stress and exhaustion it causes is never worth it. Nowadays the pinging system is good enough to still be a team player even if you have chat off. \n\nThere is absolutely no reason to have chat on, unless you like: \n\n1. dealing with in the heat of the moment gamer rage \n1. arm chair psycho analyzing sickos\n1.  ruining your long term enjoyment of the game\n1. CBT\n1. all of the above\n\nAs a side note while typing this out I realized that I did not disable chat for the longest time due to not wanting to miss out on making friends that enjoy LoL. I remember back in S4 when most of my friends enjoyed the game and we'd have 5 people even at 4 am to game with, it was the most fun I had with the game. Unfortunately they all moved on years ago and now I'm the last one left of the group with a friend list filled with offline people. I got over this FOMO quickly though, when people started doing the: add someone after game, wish them cancer then delete them before they can reply.",

The current Ahri got an entirely new model and animation package, she shares nothing with the old Ahri.\n\nThe reason SG Ahri and Spirit Blossom Ahri weren't touched was because they were more modernized Legendary skins that checked off all the boxes for sticking to their modern standards for legendary skins. They still looked pretty great and Ahri's silhouette didn't change enough to need them to completely overhaul them.\n\nThe reason champions like Mundo, Nunu, Kayle, etc., got their legendary skins overhauled was specifically because their old skins had aged horribly and were no longer up to standard for skins of their tier level. Galio is like 2/3 of the way there with his legendary skin, which uses the new base animations (which is not standard for 1820s), but has an additional VO, but champions like Tristana weren't remade when they were willing to stick to skin standards, so Firefighter got left in the lurch by having barely any difference from the base skin.",

The Legendaries already have new models and animation packages, and if they're newer with the more recent skin standards in mind, they're pretty much fine as they are. SG Ahri was one of those skins that was newer and adhered to modern standards, so that's why it was left alone. It also didn't help in Ahri's case that they went to PAINSTAKING efforts to fiddle with her tails in the ASU, almost to an obsessive degree.",

I highly think that you are blinded by nostalgia and bias and hate the update for simply being new.\n\nIt's as if Cho'Gath or Zilean were to get an ASU or VGU and you or some other Cho/Zilean main would say \"wtf the old models and animations were much better and smoother!!!\".\n\nThey are not downvoting you for having a opinion, they are downvoting you because that opinion of yours is flawed and doesnt reflect the fact that ASU Ezreal is visually superior to old Ezreal.\n\nEveryone can have an opinion, but if that opinion contradicts with facts, be prepared to have it challenged.\n\nBut even if they downvote you, who cares? These are meaningless internet points.",

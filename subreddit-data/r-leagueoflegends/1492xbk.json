Of course, I don't like it too much either.\n\nToday I logged into the game and found that there is nowhere to set private, cheers for this decision.\n\nSo, I wonder when did this great decision start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9797q0u6y5b1.jpg?width=998&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=99225296d6ec3790bbe57d60531f3729f15ff3b2",

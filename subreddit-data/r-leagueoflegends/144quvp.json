This means the NACL teams will have to abide by minimum standards in order to receive payments or revenue share from Riot  \n* A minimum of 30 days' severance pay for termination without cause for any player earning up to 1.5 times the league minimum salary and 15 days' notice for any player competing on a visa  \n* Player and teams will share equal representation on a committee to determine any future changes to the practice schedule in a collaborative manner  \n* Teams will take action to ensure all foreign players have mandated healthcare available to them by the first day they are in the US  \n* Riot and the LCSPA will sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that establishes meetings and notice parameters to ensure all parties are aligned before any future decisions are locked an communications are made  \nThank you again to the LCS community, both here at home and abroad, for supporting our players throughout this process. None of what was achieved today - nor the numerous issues we continue to fight for behind the scenes - would have been possible without your voices in support of the players.",

Because without that, players can be kicked out of the homes overnight unless the team has the good grace to house them during the transition. So I'm glad to see this.  \nNegotiations like this are like car buying or making legislation in the Capitol, you don't go in with your exact demands, you go in over the moon and then negotiate back towards what you want. So a lot of these things are in line with what I personally expected them to come away with",

Individual teams will have to give a shit to survive and can't just tread water.  They might actually have to work to generate more views and more fan-base enthusiasm.\n\nThis is where the other point of having a \"Team Participating Agreement\" which dictates eligibility for revenue sharing matters.  If you aren't pulling your weight, they can just say you don't meet the TPA and cut you out.\n\nThat said, it's a crap shoot because it's a question of if any of that is even worth it.  As a team owner, you're basically paying $300k+ in salary alone just to hope to make back at least a sustainable amount through revenue sharing and individual sponsorships in a dying e-sport.  That seems like a god awful investment.",

Some teams thought it was useful and players could review, eat, grind, practice with each other, etc. Others thought it was too long (ie: asked for 1 hour break) or couldn't find enough things to fill that time effectively. They would rather finish scrims by 5 so they can focus on those other activities afterwards. \n\nBasically, when you have 50+ players and 10+ coaches, everyone will have different thoughts on what is the most effective practice. Because everyone needs to match schedules, the majority rules. I believe the orgs voted 5-5 this spring, and they decided to give it a try.",

A lot of these points are just hot air. \n\nRiot and the teams concede next to nothing:\n\n&gt; A new NACL business model, in addition to the previously committed $300,000, that shares revenue between the tournament operator and participating teams to drive towards long-term sustainability\n\nRevenue sharing in a league that has miserable viewership and no profits is slicing a nonexistent pie. \n\n&gt; Improvements to the NACL governance model, including a Team Participating Agreement (TPA) and vetting process of the participating team organizations\n\nUnless there are actual enforcement mechanisms, this means nothing.    \n\n&gt; Minimum 30-day notice and severance requirement for players earning up to 1.5 times the league minimum salary and minimum two-week termination notice for non-resident LCS players (players and teams are free to negotiate terms over-and-above this)\n\nTeams still can fire players when they wish. They just need to let them know sooner. Unless there's some clarification, there could probably be some hilarious situations where a team finds a replacement, gives 30 days notice to the current player, and that player is only released from his contract after the split has started and/or rosters have locked.\n\n&gt; Creation of a working group between teams and the LCSPA to better optimize scrim schedules\n\nThis should have been done on a discord channel already.\n\n\n&gt; Reinforcement of healthcare insurance requirements for international LCS players when they arrive in the U.S.\n\nPretty standard. \n\n&gt; Refinement of working procedures between the LCS, LCSPA, and teams to continue conversations around the improvement of the competitive landscape in North America\n\nWord salad.",

If the LCSPA never reaches an agreement with Riot and come up with a proper requests, they would look useless/incompetent at their jobs and would take some blame for having the season cancelled. I'm sure the players would want to play the remainder of the season but theyre at the mercy of LCSPA to finalize a deal with Riot. Now, to appear victorious in this walkout, the LCSPA had to settle for peanuts and small W's so the LCS can start again... Don't be fooled that this was a big win and that LCSPA was useful in this walkout, they were under pressure with not a lot of leverage, so they settled for small W's.",

If it were more one sided, it could be fixed more easily. Not saying it would be. It honestly could have been worse but I doubt it. Think the main point was that Riot shouldn't be able to snap their fingers and fuck so many people over overnight. Now they can't but doesn't really change the big picture. Still proud of the players for the walk out. This is definitely still an improvement and maybe the LCSPA will gain more leverage over time, but the entire ecosystem is still quite fucked.",

You still have to show up, but depending on the job, you do jackshit anymore. If it is homeoffice it is basically freetime. Severance is also given. It can easily be 6 months salary for a severance after 10 years of work. Almost every german has a legal protection insurance and will instantly sue you for a hefty severance and in almost all cases the employee wins. That is why most of the time one call to HR is enough to get your severance, just the implied possibility of a lawsuit is enough to get your severance. Firing you is also very hard, but this post is already long enough.",

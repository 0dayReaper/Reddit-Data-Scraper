    "postText": "As per phantom dancer providing the 'ghosting' affect after 4 auto attacks, shouldn't Akshan's E no longer collide with enemy champions?   \n\n\nI thought so, and decided to test it out, however- that doesn't appear to be the case.  \n\n\n  Its weird, and many of the players I have talked to thought the interaction should overwrite the E, being able to run into a champion hitbox.. If they change this interaction, maybe he will have better matchups vs bruisers/tanks who could just walk in his path to interrupt his only reliable escape?",

            "comment": "Ghosting is about pathing through units, you can always overlap units by dashing or blinking on top of them unless that overlap triggers a collision proc like Akshan, Camille, Gragas, etc, because there is an effect triggered when the hit boxes touch, even if you can still path through them",

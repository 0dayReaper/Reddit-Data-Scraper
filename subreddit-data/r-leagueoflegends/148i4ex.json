You need look no further than current Vitality - amazing roster on paper, didn't make it to MSI.\n\nYet, JDG's roster is performing exactly as you would expect based on the names in it. They won the LPL spring split and they won MSI. They are looking dominating.\n\nWhat makes them successful? It can't be the names alone, because just having big names has never made a team great.",

Plus great coaching staff. \n\nLEC had successful superteam which was 2019 G2 and the players there also had similar mentality. Jankos completely changed his champion pool when he joined G2 if it meant it enabled other carries (he literally said in interview he didn't play tank junglers before). Perkz also roleswapped if it meant that they get great midlaner that will boost the team's ceiling",

(And very, very good at the utlity/enabler playstyle. Playing weakside/enabler is a skill, it's not just turning off your hands and admitting you're \"not good enough to carry\")\n\nEdit: Vitality in particular has a habit of not knowing where their wincon is and playing around it.",

A players worth is subjective and can be influenced by things such as recent game play, their personal brand, marketing potential, career trophies and achievements, etc. There are players who are criminally underpaid that perform at a high level and conversely there are players who are overpaid that play at a lower standard. \n\nA good example is HLE. Pretty much the entirety of DRX last year had a very mediocre year and barely scrapped through to Worlds. For various reasons they were able to make the run to win it all. Despite having a mediocre year this drastically increased everyone\u2019s price tags when they shopped for teams and I guarantee Zeka and Kingen made out like bandits. That and pulling Viper to the LCK means HLE likely dropped serious money qualifying them (debatable) as a super team. \n\nTL:DR The super team tag is more about the money spent on a roster rather than the quality of players.",

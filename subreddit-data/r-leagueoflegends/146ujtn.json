You having played similar game before will help in terms of mechanics in some way but playing with friends would also help a lot too, also reduce the frustration of playing with smurf account.",

My advice is to set your chat to \"party only\" if you haven't already. \n\nIf you've played similar games before I assume you're playing with free camera, but if not unlock it as soon as possible.\n\nIf you want to learn what champs abilities do more quickly (and get better at dodging them), mix some ARAM games into your rotation. It's pretty 4fun, but it helped me learn all the new champs after I came back to league after a multi year break.",

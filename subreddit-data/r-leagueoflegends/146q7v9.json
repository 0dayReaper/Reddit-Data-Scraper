Insane mobility, high damage against both squishies and tanks, plus one of the most insane gold -&gt; dmg ratios in the game (she can be a full item behind and still be a serious threat). That last one is my biggest gripe. Dumpstering an Akali and then watching her continue to carry as though it never happened is super fun. ",

Considering her E2 doesn\u2019t really ever hit the 1k damage mark until she\u2019s sold boots for another a 6th item and has elixir (a fraction of games) I would say that\u2019s not terrible.",

            "comment": "Oh, definitely not! Akali is the epitome of balance and fairness. Her mobility is completely reasonable, her damage is perfectly tuned to only tickle squishies, and her ability to shred tanks is absolutely nonexistent. And that gold-to-damage ratio you mentioned? Oh, it's just completely in line with the rest of the champions in the game. There's certainly no advantage or disproportionate power spike that she gets from it. And let's not forget the sheer joy of dumpstering an Akali, only to witness her crumble and become a non-factor for the rest of the game. It's like a heartwarming fairy tale, where the big bad Akali is finally put in her place and has no impact whatsoever. It's truly the most satisfying experience in League of Legends. In conclusion, I completely disagree with your assessment. Akali is a well-balanced, fair, and utterly unproblematic champion in every sense. Facing her is a breeze, and shutting her down once is enough to render her useless for the entire match. It's an absolute pleasure to witness her insignificance after a single defeat. Who needs a challenge or a competitive environment when you can have such a predictable and straightforward encounter with Akali? Truly a masterpiece of game design.",

But she's not the only champ where it applies, see GP or Qiqi.\n\n&gt;Dumpstering an Akali and then watching her continue to carry\n\nThat's the case with all AP melee mids, they are supposed to lose early, be behind in cs, then spike in mid game and hopefully take over.",

You farm gold twice as fast as everyone else thanks to first strike + passive, your Q crits for like 1500 dmg, and your passive dmg, while not as egregious as it was a few patches ago, still does upwards of 5-600 true damage in the mid to late game.",

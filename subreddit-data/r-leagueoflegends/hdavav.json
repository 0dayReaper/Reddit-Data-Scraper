If I ever play again, I\u2018ll instantly block allchat. It honestly kills my mood when people treat each other like that.",

You're likely just going to lose another teamfight, end up even further behind in gold and exp, and then lose tower you were \"grouping\" to protect in the first place. \n\nIn a lot of cases it's better for your team to soak exp in sidelines so they have a shot at catching up. Even if they're taking your mid tower, they're sharing one lane worth of gold and exp between 5 players. If you guys have 3 mid and two players in sidelines, it gives the players in sidelines time to catch up in gold and exp, and they can probably take a tower as well, trading tower for tower while gaining solo exp and gold.",

Pick broken fotm champions (if you\u2019re playing mid pick Galio nocturne talon basically fast clear roaming champs). Jungle I\u2019ve personally been seeing success with sylas but u can play things like zac and olaf (or even Warwick). U need to be the rock in your team that\u2019s going to carry them from these reliable roles. And in low gold and below unfortunately people play the weirdest champs in roles so definitely dodge the games where u get things like jhin top.",

I really do feel like ranked queues sometimes just decides it wants to put you in a losers queue for a bit just to mess with you. You'll pop back up though. If you got to gold 1 the first time you can do it again and it's not too far a jump up to plat.",

[ roller coaster matchmaking](https://i.imgur.com/xWFOE43.jpg). Basically it gives you easy games then hard games back and forth (not a binary W/L/W/L though, more streaky). Why?  To keep people addicted and have more chances to buy RP rather than have every game be as close in skill as it can. It got to the point that the most efficient way to climb according to most people was to just look at team match history in champ select and see if your team is win-streaking or lose-streaking and dodge accordingly. Obviously skilled players can still climb normally, but it's less enjoyable than it should be and makes games more toxic. \n\nLot's of video game companies are looking to get more money via psychology these days and it's really hurting the games themselves.",

I don't believe in ELO Hell, but Riot basically designed a matching making system as if they were creating ELO Hell. There's no worse way for ranked players to feel mentally than to win a bunch of games, go into Gold/Plat/whatever and then lose 8 games and fall back down. I don't know if promotion series are still around but it's the single most stress inducing thing in that entire game. I remember giving up and not playing my promotion series for diamond because the disappointment of losing them was worse than taking the opportunity to play the games. Of all the competitive ladders/systems if its ESEA/CS:GO, Dota2, Overwatch Competitive, etc, there isn't and probably never will be a game that makes ranked play feel more shitty than league. Me and my buddy we both quit playing back a couple years ago after trying to grind out ranked for a while, it just wasn't fun and it kind of killed any enjoyment we had for the game. It's funny because we always joked about Riot fixing our matches because of how used to this nonsense we were, we wondered if we were going to get queued up with our Silver friend because we won a game. It's kind of crazy after a couple of years people still talking about these issues.\n\nFor what it's worth I think Riot has a gold mine on Valorant but I just hope they don't introduce shitty system into that game and hopefully care a bit more on the balance aspect of the game.",

Then the group fell apart and I wasn't able to find a group of people that fit my schedule with that approach. So I played solo and I tried to play right, but I don't have time to keep up and I've just gotten shittier. So I stopped playing rift because it wasn't fun feeling like you are just wasting peoples time and no one was having fun. So I picked up aram but then it kind of happened there too. Like I'm not great at the game, I know, I can't play that often but I'm trying my best. Just get verbally abused by a bunch of 14 yr olds hiding behind their anonymity. Yeah, not fun. So we don't play it at all anymore. Great game. Lots of fun to be had but the community and na pro players have fostered a really shitty attitude towards a cooperative game that is just hard deal with. So I don't.",

Even playing other (far less addicting) video games helped. And then over time the memory of the game just started to fade, especially with such drastic changes to the game recently.

Sometimes someone else does it at the same time and there's a cacophony of pings for a bit, which is funny.\n\nBeing able to laugh at yourself reduces your ego and makes mistakes hurt less.",

It isn't worse or better now, but we got tools to work with that:\nMuting and disabling chat before the game starts is the best thing Riot did for Chat-toxicity. Do yourself a favor if you tilt from the smallest sample of flame and deactivate chat. If you can handle it before it gets to a point where it's unbearable you can let it stay active and muter the flamer.",

I just love the high-difficulty games like KOF and TEKKEN, it drives me to further discover how i can improve! \n\nLeague looks cool and interesting to watch when the LEC/LCK/LPL pros do it (i think im forgetting one major region), but try to log in and climb ranked?

                    "comment": "As a dota player, i think i can pinpoint league's problem to the surrender button. Every time my friends want me to play league with them, when we start to lose they immediately want to surrender ASAP. Every time we're winning the enemy surrenders ASAP. Even when they have a comp that will clearly outscale the enemy if they hold the fort for just a few more minutes, theh don't care. They want to forget about it and move on to the next game. Very few games actually reach lategame in my experience. This does a few things to the game as a whole. \n\nFirst, it tilts the statistics that riot can work with into the early mid-game games. This means that the statistics used to balance the game will tell you that champs that are essentially lane bullies as well as champs with good early fight potential will see higher winrates because of their early advantage leading to surrenders, while late-game characters that would rely more on holding the fort long enough to make a comeback will see lower win rates. Riot COULD then use these stats to balance the late-game champs around the surrender timer, but that would make them severly overpowered in the late game... \n\nThis bias for games to end earlier than necesarry wil also lead to the earlier champ smasing popularity trends, which only serves to exacerbate the problem. Players past their powerspikes wll be much more likely to surrender a winnable game. So the more early champs are played, the earlier players will potentially want to surrender\n\nCompare this to dota, no surrender button. Late game characters are just as popular as early ones. Even hyper-late carries like spectre see their time of day. Comebacks happe quite often due to powerspike timings. A snowballing queen of pain may destroy your team for the first, 20 minutes of the game, but if your anti-mage can farm his items he WILL put her in her place. Early game compositions are FORCED to push and end early or suffer the late game of wrath of their opponents.",

            "comment": "We EVE Online now.\n  \nMore seriously, I am still having a lot of fun in League - much more this season actually, than previous ones. The previous season I played very few ranked games and more ARAM/Draft, for fun. However the lack of competitive pressure actually made the game feel very stale to me. Now, I am all for removing trolls/flamers/smurfs from the game, but personally with the current state of the game, SoloQ is where it's at for most fun, for me.",

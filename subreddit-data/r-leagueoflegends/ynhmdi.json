Ever since their first step toward Worlds, they have never been favored once:  \n\\- Pre-Playoffs: Out of the 6 teams that can qualify for worlds, we might not know which teams will make it, but we for sure know that DRX won't make it.   \n\\- KT vs DRX: KT should handily beat DRX -&gt; DRX win in close 5 game series -&gt; KT 'choked' and LSB should sweep DRX.  \n\\-LSB vs DRX: LSB is heavily favored -&gt; DRX win in 5 game series -&gt; general consensus is that DRX is the worst team out of the three to represent the LCK.\n\n**Worlds**  \n\\- DRX is the weakest eastern team at Worlds; they probably won't make it out of groups.  \n\\- RNG should clap DRX -&gt; DRX win and secure 1st in play-ins.  \n\\- DRX is fighting for 2nd place in groups, TES should be locked in first and RGE is still   \n  favored against DRX -&gt; DRX finish 1st in groups.  \n\\- EDG favored against DRX -&gt; DRX wins after an insane reverse sweep.  \n\\- GENG heavily favored against DRX -&gt; DRX takes the win.  \n\\-T1 heavily favored against DRX -&gt; DRX wins and becomes World Champions.\n\nI think the casters summed it up perfectly, if someone explained DRX's miracle run as the plot of a story, I would probably roll my eyes. Constantly the underdog in every series, makes it to the quarterfinals and faces off against the *Defending World Champions* on Deft's Birthday, reverse sweeps EDG after losing game 2 because of an inhib respawn (and being one auto-attack away from destroying the nexus), then goes against the *Pre-Tournament Favorites* and *LCK's 1st seed* GEN.G, unexpectedly beats them, only to go against the most accomplished org in LoL history and the GOAT, and winning in a close 5 game series. Deft has been in several superteams and failed to win Worlds, only to win after joining a seemingly mediocre team. DRX's run will definitely be remembered for the rest of league history.",

    "postText": "In Riots newest dev blog they shared some information about how they want to redistribute the players on all the ranks (and their new rank \"Emerald\"). So I worked on some graphs that shows you where in this new distribution you will most likely end up (note that the graph does not take into account if individual players actually get better/worse at the game).\n\nfirst lets look at our current distribution:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[current distribution](https://preview.redd.it/w0vjro7vd15b1.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ef06b46b7381c3a14c4dd6f3c12010110da59041)\n\nAnd now look what riot is aiming for:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[riots new distribution](https://preview.redd.it/87wbv6a1e15b1.png?width=835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3a14c6179aa4aca17df15178133dca0d1f822909)\n\nAnd now i split up every elo from split 1 into the new distribution:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[new distribution filled with old ranks](https://preview.redd.it/sdgoueh9e15b1.png?width=835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=48abfef964ad9c16f8c3b71afb23f84781a9ab25)\n\nSo if you are currently in high Silver 1, next split you will find yourself in low Plat.\n\nIf you have questions feel free to ask!",

Right now it looks like in the new graph the 3 biggest groups are at the same height as the old graph. So the gut reaction is that they shifted things to the right only.

Since most players are around the middle of the distribution, what this does is make a player who may play 100-200 games to get from Bronze 4 to Silver 1, instead go from Silver to Plat in the same range, giving a better sense of progression. (Also probably why they flattened out the middle instead of keeping a bell curve.) This also allows them to (at least for the bulk of players) even out LP gains/losses so they don't feel so bad.\n\nIt's all about perception. Since there were as many players in silver as all of gold-challenger, they're doing this so there's more of a spread across the middle range.\n\nAlso most other games have gold/plat as the 50% average, so Riot is also matching those games so League doesn't feel so punishing compared to competition. As it is now, someone could be gold or plat in Rocket League, Overwatch, Apex, etc. but be Silver in League, which makes people feel the matchmaking is rigged and losers queue and all that. This is essentially Riot saying, \"No, it's not, our distribution was just different, but here you go, have your ranks now just shut up about it already!\"",

With the exceptional on the top tier, and beginners and the worst on the bottom. The majority SHOULD sit in the center tier if they play any ranked game  regularly. Look at FPS, fighting games, sports games, etc. League is the odd one out. The had majority of the player base in lower tiers. That\u2019s just odd, how is the average amount of players below average? For an entire decade. That hundreds of thousands of people not improving. That doesn\u2019t make sense, the curve should have slowly shifted over the years. But League\u2019s bad matchmaking, random LP gain, annual elo reset, and promotions were only there to force players to play League longer. It\u2019s been know for years the only way to find your true placement, is to start a fresh account every season.",

In most things that require skill, the vast majority are on the low end of the skill distribution, because developing high skill takes time and effort, and also talent as you get to higher degrees of skill. And the vast majority of participants are not going to put in the time and effort to develop skill at a higher level.\n\nFor example, look at the elo distribution on [chess.com](https://chess.com)'s blitz leaderboard: [https://www.chess.com/leaderboard/live](https://www.chess.com/leaderboard/live)\n\nThe vast majority of players are sitting under 1000. The average rating is 657, and the median appears to be somewhat over 500.\n\nWhen you force skill into a normal distribution like this, you're distorting the real picture. You're making it appear that there's far less difference in skill at the top end than there is, and a far greater difference in skill among lower skilled players.",

Sure skill generally may well be like chess where some upper level is far above the regular population, but this is a team game. \n\nWithin a rank random sampling from an unknown distribution (or a log normal which you allude to) the sample means are going to be normal.\n\nMoreover league has far more independent variables as opposed to chess, which is one person\u2019s knowledge vs the other.

As someone who played a ton in early seasons, and has stepped away in the last 5-6 years, the \"average player\" in gold is what plat used to be, and this ranking system basically moves people around to make it more sensible to what ranks once were. Now your gold (plat in earlier seasons) player is now actually plat. Shifting everything makes sense to me on the outside, having played just a few months ago and seen the overall caliber of high gold/low plat players compared to when I played a lot (was d2 at peak in s3-s5).",

The reason there's a giant cluster at Silver-Gold is because skill-wise that's where most players are at. According to this math, I'm going to come out at high plat. \n\nTheoretically, I'm going to still see similar opponents, they'll just all be mid plat to low emerald instead of gold. But I'm concerned the matchmaking will be comfortable matching me against opponents that used to be too many tiers above me. \n\nMaybe I'm getting too concerned about a problem that won't come to fruition, but I do still see the ranks squashing back how they did. If the skill gap from silver 3 to gold 4 isn't all that drastic now, that's going to end up making a similar skill gap from silver 1 to plat 4 in the new distribution.",

Just counter productive. if its Gold 2-D4, the matchmaking and flame going to be horendous. D4 will freeze lane, use optimal resets,  while G2 homie just got the hang of objectives. \n\nShit going to be brutal fiesta lol",

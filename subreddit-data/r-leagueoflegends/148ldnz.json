In past Years we had your typical toxic Streamers, but also People making Memetages, fun, creative Videos, Games with Friends, etc. All of that provided a different Look and Attitude around the Game.\n\nBut those all left, I can't think of a single wholesome Creator that actually plays the Game and makes Videos in which they promote somewhat positive Behaviour in the Game. All we have left are some Documentary Style Channels and toxic Streamers left and right.\n\nThat's what new Players will replicate.",

Those are things some people may not like.\n\nAll that to say, I've noticed over the last few years that there has started to be a loud minority that have weaponized \"toxicity\" to mean anything that they don't like, anything that is uncomfortable or inconvenient, or anything that they don't agree with. These people are softer than Charmin and it gets really old hearing people cry about \"toxicity\" when the real toxic is the sentiment that any kind of opposition or difficulty you can't handle should have the developers shield you instead of you taking care of yourself.",

I can't tell you how many times people run from fair fights or fights where they have numbers advantages, but they still choose to. It ruins my experience and the experience of friends.

    "postText": "I reached gold 4 and after that i stopped playing because i just wanted to get the skin without grinding 1600 split points. Now, i have a question: when i look at the ranked zone in profile in client, there is no \"ok\" or something like that on the split points needed to get the skin, so i need to get the 80 split points while im gold or the ones i got while climbing are enough? Im answering because ppl online have a \"tick\" on the circle in bottom left with the info about sp but i do not.",

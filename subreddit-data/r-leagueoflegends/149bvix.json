    "postText": "Made a slightly different frame to match the theme of Darkstar Lux. I wanted to match her vibe and if you play Magic then you know, frames styled like this don't exist. There's no color that would use this. This is literally just for the purpose of matching with the skin itself. It's a fun project, I started making League Magic cards some time back just because it's fun to have. Fun to use. ALSO I've looked for the artist of both of these, I can't find them. If you see them, feel free to leave their name below. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/up4lni58b06b1.jpg?width=2550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fb99d38bb309a274568417a4333299c779151e0a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbsm4k58b06b1.jpg?width=2550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aa4aee6250f9e1391834bfd565d7f8ddb25d38d8",

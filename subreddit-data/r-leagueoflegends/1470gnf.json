    "postText": "I'm sick and tired of smurfs/fresh accounts in my games.It's either some really toxic player perma typing (hence why they just bought a new account)  or some high elo player who stomps his lane .Needless to say this brings down the  game experience for many players. It's sad  to see atleast one lvl 31 account in every ranked game we play. Why does riot allow an account into ranked queue which has'nt even played a single normal game before and only bot games ?It's  unhealthy for the game.An Idea to semi fix it is  to force  accounts to play atleast 10 normal games per 3 months to be able to queue ranked for the first time. (This obviously makes it harder for botted accounts to be able to instanly queue ranked)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:  Naturually people want proof\n\nThis is my account [https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/J%20Wizzly](https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/J%20Wizzly)\n\n* vlad game: ekko new acc\n* 0/1 twitch game: zed new acc\n* ziggs game: gnar AND renekton new acc\n* 18/6 twitch game: ekko AND j4 new acc\n* vayne game: Kha zix new acc\n* pyke game Kindred new acc\n\nthat is litereally 6 games in a row for you, with a minimum of one new account per game. Take into account that I defined \"new account\" very strictly meaning lvl 30-40 accounts.\n\nThis is only my account, people in the comments have checked their own accounts and approved my complaint, facing new accounts every game.",

Also the mugger is live streaming it with the hashtag #police",

If a smurf wins in a smurfQ game, is he going to be placed in non smurfQ bronze? Silver? Plat? Even after 50 games in smurfQ. There is no correlation to mmr on the other side of the Q where non smurfs play. You would actually need a completely separate queue, but i doubt that would have sufficient players and even be a remotely sane solution. Even aside from the implementation where someones main account would often end up in it.",

If anything having one or two smurfs every game is 100 times better than having to play with 9 smurfs and hoping you get the good ones, oh and because it's smurf queue, your queues are long and you play with the same people sometimes 3 games in a row, enjoy.",

Imagine being a non smurf there, you would have 0 impact on any games outcome really.\n\nThen you get out of smurf queue, finally get to play some real games, decide to take a break and it's the same all over again!!!!!\n\nAnyone who wants smurf queue (as it was) back is just braindead imo",

I kid you not almost every single game back was this exact experience. At first I thought it was me just being crazy but I legit asked and they all just admit it. Apparently accounts cost like 2 bucks so no one cares and if they get banned they just buy a new account. Games boiled down to which team had the better Smurf.

It's the wins too. So many of my games I get hard carried by a jungler who decided the game in the first 10minutes and I didn't have to play the game. It's frustrating when you're against them, and it's boring when you're with them. They need to fix it. Matchmaking is a disaster and smurfing is a LARGE part of it.\n\nOh and boosting is out of hand. People can buy a level 30 acc, rank it up, and sell it. It's even safer than boosting because you're not playing off someone elses account (technically).",

It\u2019s just annoying that games are held hostage by smurfs in lower elos, one way or another. Just wanting to play the game with similarly skilled players to slowly improve becomes near impossible, you just have to keep throwing your head against the wall in hopes of getting better when they plague your lane.\n\nKinda makes me wanna see the Korean method of accounts, like how they have their SSN tied to their account so they can only have ONE, or Alt accounts all have similar elo because it\u2019s tied to the main. Definitely makes it so you can\u2019t flame and troll on an Alt then switch to your main, all accounts would be penalized.",

That level 30 thing hasn't changed in 13 years.\n\nMake qualifying for ranked something a bot can't do. Require wins, require deathless games, require 10 kills, give it missions, like a whole UI page. You need to make getting a new smurf and starting to play more effort than it is or they will never care what happens to that account. If they don't care, there's nothing to hold over them to make them try to behave.\n\nA bot shouldn't be able to just play vs AI then immediately sell the account and that new guy be able to queue for ranked. The bot should have to do things in normal games that a bot would find very difficult to do and they need to be lengthy enough that if the buyer does them there's still a lot of effort in for them to make losing that account a pain.\n\nI don't think new players need ranked so urgently that they can't do a qualification series of missions to enable it. Level 30 is too low of a single barrier to entry.",

From level 30 to level 50, players will have to play PvP modes. \nIf account botters actually have to manually level their accounts, they\u2019ll be forced to sell them for higher prices to make it worth their while. \nBasic economics tells us that as prices go up, demand for accounts will go down. \nCurrently, when a toxic player gets banned, they just buy a level 30 account and immediately continue being toxic in ranked.\nWith this change, they will have two options:\nOption 1: buy a level 30 account and have to play 20 levels worth of norms where they\u2019ll be banned again before they hit Ranked if their behavior continues, or;\nOption 2: shell out the money for a level 50 account and change their behavior because buying a level 50 account actually hurts their wallet.",

People complain about other 'stuck' players making new accounts and deem them smurfs because they won vs bronze or silvers and they 'troll' gold-diamond games when in fact those players are gold-diamond themselves and that's their legit skill level, not trolling simply being outmatched. A proper smurf doesn't get to play with people below high diamond for more than 20-30 games.  I feel like the masses are shifting the meaning of the term, smurf is supposed to be a high elo player on a low account not just an alternate account regardless of skill difference.",

Yes, it is possible for that random gold player on your team who has 2m mastery on katarina to buy another account and also style on you because it is literally their otp. Mechanics are some of the easiest things to develop (watch a few guides and then put in as much practice as is necessary, very linear improvement curve since WHAT you need to develop is clear). It is also very possible to develop mechanics and still stay stuck. \n\nHere's a test. Mark the last 10 smurfs you think you've encountered and then track their climb over the next couple of weeks (or even months, it doesn't take that much effort to do). See how many remain in your mmr and see how many don't.",

You got your account and your friends account flagged as smurfs for Normal games (this is different from the smurf queue that Riot removed from ranked) because you are in fact a smurf. By game 5 you were probably already playing against smurfs (just low elo ones), and you beat them. Even if your friend is literal dead weight, you would probably hard carry most games against most players.  \n  \nIt sucks, but it's not possible to provide fair matchmaking for the scenario you described. If they put you against opponents that let your friend play the game, you'll just hard carry every game. They either ruin the experience for you and your friend, or they ruin it for 5 other people every game.  \n  \nThe only way I can think of for you to play with a new player that MIGHT not be problematic, is if you play support, refuse to take any kills, don't roam, and don't build damage. While your friend would definitely do better than if you weren't there, it won't steamroll as hard. You would be more dependent on your friend's abilities to actually win games, which should result in you losing some (which is necessary to not drive up your Normals MMR to Masters).",

You have to play according to the elo to not be flagged. Means you have to grief super hard if youre masters skill.",

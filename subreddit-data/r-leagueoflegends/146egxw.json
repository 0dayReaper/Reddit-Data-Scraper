Bo2s give you draws, but they're much better for competitive integrity while also keeping a flowing schedule\n\nEDIT: for some other esports examples, Dota2 does Bo2s for the same reason outside of playoffs.  CS:GO doesn't, but they don't tend to have round robin group stages and they'd have a lot more draws since both teams would get a game on a map of their choosing.",

A match can end in just 1 hr~ if one team rolls the other (Say for ex a 13-2, 13-4 game), but can *easily* go over 2 hours if it's a close match and goes to map 3 (For ex a 13-11, 10-13, 15-13 game). Length volatility really doesn't seem like a justified reason. \n\nI feel like every game deserves its own conclusion. Also imo viewers will naturally leave dissatisfied if they invested an hour into watching a game and the game ends on a draw specifically because the format heavily enables draws. \n\nSurely Riot/the TO can figure out a way to make the schedule work with Bo3s, especially with the League only having 10 teams now instead of 16.",

League is so streamlined that almost every game falls between 25-40 minutes so you schedule 2 hours per Bo2 and you have a comfy schedule.\n\nAs for the satisfaction of draws, isn't soccer the most popular sport in the world?  It's clearly not a dealbreaker for a lot of viewers",

Soccer might be the biggest game in the world, but it's not in America, and it's not close. Soccer is the favorite sport of 7% of Americans, no one here gives a shit about soccer.\n\nAmericans don't like ties in our sports. There's usually one tie per year in the NFL, and everyone unanimously hates it. They used to have ties in the NHL, but everyone hated it so they removed it and replaced it with 3-player OT and a shootout. Baseball added special rules to shorten extra inning games. Basketball has obviously never had ties.\n\nI get it, people in Europe like soccer and ties. NA fans don't. Except the ultra hardcore eSports kids like you, and let's be real, easy marks who love it that much would watch regardless of format. \n\nBut hey, NA League is clearly thriving, so no one must agree with me. Player numbers and LCS viewership just keep going up and up, so no one must agree with me. See what I'm doing here?",

The better team doesn't always win in a Bo1.\n\nBo1's also have the rather big problem of side selection mattering in League. Blue vs. Red side is not an equal 50/50, and depending on the meta one can be quite heavily favored, at the very least in draft phase if there are certain picks that are super strong. The problem has been 'avoided' historically through the teams playing one another 2 times over the 8-9 weeks' regular season, once on each side, but there are patch changes that can alter the power dynamic of each side quite significantly. Bo2 completely avoids that problem by both playing once on each side.\n\nBo3's are *for the most part* the better format, but they take quite a bit more time to play out. The Eastern leagues have had a Bo3 regular season for quite a good while now regardless, but they also play on most days of the week to compensate.\n\nI do agree that it ending in a tie is somewhat anticlimactic, but at the same time, the regular season games aren't 'supposed' to be the exciting ones to begin with. They're the games for seeding and to see which teams go to playoffs and such. That might be a rough way to look at it, but I don't think most people would argue against that either.",

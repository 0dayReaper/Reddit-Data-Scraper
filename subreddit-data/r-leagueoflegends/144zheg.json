Kinda crazy but probably true once you factor in the full population.\n\nI think in the western region it's probably not as true, but since League is growing a lot in developing countries like Vietnam etc, it's probably true in general. Especially since so many countries got much more connected to the internet over the past decade.\n\nI'm sure even in the west, there's a huge share of the current population that started in 2020 during COVID lockdown as well for example. \n\nJust funny to imagine how even a lot of the people that write comments here on reddit might have started the game so late and that obviously shapes their opinions and preferences a ton.\n\nIf someone fell in love with LoL in 2012 and someone else fell in love with it in 2020, they basically fell in love with totally a different games at this point lmao.",

A lot of the old champions had point-and-click CC; it's just CC was generally rarer, and mobile champions were just generally more mobile versus the marksmen which generally were even slower and shorter-range than today, but became WAY bigger stat-sticks.  CC champions were old WW, old Malz, Gragas, Old Panth, old sion, old Annie... You get the picture.  Not to mention assassins being like old Akali, old Kat, and old old Talon.  Back then, Ashe was a lane bully because she had pretty high range with that charging guaranteed crit over time when not AA'ing, so people would just max crit damage runes at L1 and drop someone by 40% max HP on first trade lol.\n\nAnd how in 2009, pre-rework Malady + BT + IE was like a modern-day four-to-five item build for DPS alone, since iirc that was like +200 AD, 75% crit chance, 30-50% attack speed, 40% lifesteal, 50% crit damage, 22(?) on-hit damage, and flat armor shred on hit.\n\n\nThe game was VERY different back then where weird combos like lane bully Ashe and 900AD Crit Shaco were things people could and did climb on.",

While needing to purchase them sucked, there were a lot of factors you could customize based on the match-up, champion or playstyle.\n\nA few of my favourite selections:\n- Flat Armor Quints and Scaling Armor Seals against certain AD match-ups could be hilariously against certain opponents.\n- MS Quints were great for certain roles and playstyles\n- Scaling CDR Quints/Glyphs were quite nice on champions who scaled well with CDR but had trouble itemizing it.\n\nIf they made the runes free and let you customize them in champion select (rather than only letting you select a pre-built page), they could have stayed around.",

It changed nothing on how those champions truly looks like.\n\nTheir model, their rig, their animations, their voice lines are still the same. Only the outer paintjob is somewhat crispier.\n\nBut painting a pile of poop in gold color, doesnt make the pile less of a pile of shit.",

Akali is the only champion in the game that I'm guaranteed to run it down on. I roughly know what to do:\n\n(Q -&gt; E back out of the Q circle -&gt; E2 onto enemy -&gt; passive hit + Q -&gt; ult out of circle -&gt;  passive hit + Q/R to finish) \n\nbut idk I just fucking int every single time.

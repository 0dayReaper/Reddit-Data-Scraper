It's not uncommon for the final cut to arrive at broadcast station hours before airing popular tv series, replacing older version that are either rendered faster with less image quality or, in the context of cartoon, not fully colored/inked.\n\nThis is why when you buy CD/DVD/Bluray version of whatever series you watch on TV you end up feeling that there is more details because... [there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y4vvnVVT3U).",

There's stories about it all over the internet - just last season, one of the producers for Wonder Egg Priority [was hospitalized](https://animegalaxyofficial.com/wonder-egg-priority-producer-hospitalized-due-to-overwork/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20rumored%20tweet,final%20episode%20of%20the%20series.&amp;text=Later%20on%2C%20the%20tweet%20was,who%20uploaded%20it%2C%20as%20well.) and they ended up \"wasting\" an episode to run a recap instead, with the true series finale now [delayed until June](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-03-30/wonder-egg-priority-anime-gets-special-edition-broadcast-to-conclude-story-on-june-29/.171306). That producer ended up going back to work 5 hours later too.\n\nThis is not the industry normal afaik. You have plenty of shows like Steven Universe and Avatar: The Last Airbender having entire episodes completed months (or even a year+) in advance and then the network just sits on them until they decide they have a good slot for premiere. Just watching the Marvel TV Shows on Disney+ I highly doubt any of those were finished last minute either when we had promo reels for some of those scenes like 2 years ago before Covid hit.",

It seems like the show will switch back and forth between the past and the \"present\" of Runeterra, starting off with Vi and Jinx as young teenagers before eventually shifting over to their current adult ages.\n\nAssuming Ekko's in-game dialogues and taunts are still canon, he knew and admired both Jinx and Vi before the former \"started talking to her gun\" and the latter \"betrayed\" Zaun's people for Piltover, so there's a good chance he could be 8-13 or so during this period, I suppose.\n\nEDIT:  IIRC, Riot's writers have admitted that excessive time travel might have affected his aging process to some degree, so there's a chance he could be several years older than he looks.",

Judging by the show happening in the past and is to be an origin story, they could show him as having a cameo in the dredge being chained or tortured or something even without a major role before him becoming cyborg bane.\n\nThey can still insert some major characters showing them in their past lives, granted being heavily rooted in their region, Piltover and Zaun (Camille, Viktor, Singed, Warwick etc.) Still it depends on where exactly the show happens, it is totally possible that he would still be at Noxus during the show's timeline so yeah.

In league its a blue dude trying to collect all the stones to save everyone but in MCU its a purple dude collecting stone to kill.",

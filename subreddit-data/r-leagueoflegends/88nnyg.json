Overall they were strong back in the day sure but with power/mobility creep over the years I feel confident that a good xayah or a good  Lucian player could run circles around old graves/corki",

Adc corki, adc graves, mid gragas, could be some others I'm forgetting, basically the entire core of the champion, and what position they excel in was completely changed. Nowadays riot is much better about keeping the spirit of the old champ alive when they rework, such as irelia where much of her core gameplay was kept intact, and performs a similar role (bruiser toplaner) that old irelia did",

Their changes ruined her feel for me, she stopped feeling smooth and fun to play.  Same with Graves, who was my main ADC, just wasn't fun to play anymore after the rework.  I played a lot of Corki before his rework as well, basically if I was ADC and I couldn't play Graves for whatever reason I played Corki or EZ.  Also less of an issue, but I really didn't enjoy the Gangplank or Ryze rework either.  Oh, and I really don't like the Malzahar rework either.\n\nOlaf was another champ I *loved*.  They totally destroyed him because he was too OP, let him sit at like a 35-40% winrate for months and months, changed him and buffed him back up, he was good again but they thought he was too strong again.  So they nerfed him which balanced him, then next patch nerfed all his core items which sent him back into the dumpster.\n\nI just got freaking tired of riding the rollercoaster, it felt like every time that I settled on a Champion I got the rug yanked out from under me a patch or two later by Riot.  Got real old.\n\nAlso I was one of those masochists who really enjoyed the support era where your main job was buying wards and oracles, and thought that supporting became a lot less fun when you couldn't do that anymore.",

Didn't win much, but I had fun and enjoyed it. The new sion I've played like 3 games on and it just isn't the same champ. Who cares if he's never picked, just leave him be (or nerf his cancer AP Q) and put a new mega undead champ in the game that is current Sion...",

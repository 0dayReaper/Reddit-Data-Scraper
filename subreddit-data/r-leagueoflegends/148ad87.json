If you\u2019re playing support don\u2019t worry about CS right now and just get used to the map tbh. When I got started I would be constantly lost in terms of location, but it\u2019s important to know where and when heralds/dragons/baron spawn. Try walking on the map in practice tool and note where the brushes are. Those are where enemies can jump you.\n\nIf your friend is playing with you on their main account , don\u2019t worry too much about dying a lot for the first couple of games. It\u2019s because you\u2019re being paired up with much more experienced players (ideally you should be playing with beginners but smurfs are a thing anyways). Turn chat off, and have fun! \n\nNote: ARAM is a game mode with no objectives, and people get random champions. It can be good for choosing a champ or just practicing movement/dodging since there\u2019s only 1 lane. It can a little overwhelming though because it\u2019s constant team fights, just a suggestion in case you\u2019re frustrated with summoner\u2019s rift.",

Some supports that have value even if you fall behind and relatively easy to play are Sona/Soraka (healer), Leona/Nautilus (tank), and Zyra (mage). Again, just turn chat off until you\u2019re comfortable with the game :)",

            "comment": "Some basics:\n\nAnimation cancelling; every champion has a 'wind up,' 'execution,' and 'wind down' animation for their auto attacks (and spells). Learning to cancel the 'wind down' time of your abilities with more useful commands---movement, other spells, auto attacks, item actives---is an important early skill to master\n\nSeparate keybinds for quick cast and casting with indicator---smartcast is ok, but it's slower than quick casting spells, but the indicator's useful sometimes, so default quick cast, and then bind cast with indicator or smartcast to shift + ability.\n\nUse keybinds for levelling up your abilities.\n\nSwap your f and a keybinds; you don't ult much, but attack moving is very important and helps with spacing, so you can use your index finger to attack move and use your pinky for other keybindings/a long cd summoner spell (alternatively you can put seldom-used bindings on your mouse thumb buttons).\n\nIf your keyboard has a huge gap between the numbers and f keys, or if you have difficulty finding a 'home' for your hand, move all the keybinds down one row so you can home your hand off of f, and have an extra row of easily accessible keys above your hand (I personally find it easier to reach up 2 rows than down 2 rows).\n\nSet your 'target champions only' key to something you can easily select with your pinky (caps lock and a are decent choices, esp if you bind a summoner spell to one of your mouse keys.\n\nYou can hit the 's' key to make your champion stop auto attacking/performing actions, which is very helpful.\n\n(It might help just looking up a settings guide on youtube tbh)\n\nI recommend not playing support, but just try a bunch of champions in different roles vs bots; see what you enjoy.\n\nWhen possible try to practice hitting the enemy anytime they're last-hitting cs, or after they've used an ability as it'll give you a big edge once you start  playing vs humans.\n\nLook up a warding guide before you start playing humans. \n\nOnce you've got the basics down look up wave management; it's not important until you've got the other stuff down though.\n\nYou can use sites like [op.gg](https://op.gg) to look up builds, runes, and champion match ups, which is very helpful if you're newer.\n\nWhen in doubt, do a google search! The game is well-established, and there's a youtube video explaining anything you might possibly have a question about.",

This is just a generic 'good practice' you should do for 5-10 minutes whenever you sign on to build muscle memory and get warmed up, and not something you need to sink a lot of time into all at once.\n\nRelated to cs-ing: When you're csing under tower without items, it always takes 2 tower hits and one champion auto to kill melee minions. For caster minions it's inverted, always 2 champion autos and one tower shot. (This changes after you buy some AD, if you're an AD champion)",

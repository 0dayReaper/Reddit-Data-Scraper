    "postText": "Riot may claim a thousand times that group reports count as one (or do they not? but such a myth exists among the players), but you can get as many insults as you like, and the only way to punish for this is to be in a group and send several reports. I never get notifications now - none for solo reports. And I get \"soft\" warnings for playing without any insults only from group-players when I'm playing solo. The most rude thing in my logs is mirrored \"no, you're silly\". The person who called me silly didn't get a warning, of course - he was in the group.\n\nSo if you usually play with friends, you can insult solo players with impunity, call them rude words, etc., and you won't get anything for it - because the player will send only one report! But if he/she answers you something, even neutral, without insults - feel free to send 3-4 reports and enjoy the punishment notification.\n\nAnd if you play solo in a game with a group, then ... endure in silence. You will be \\*\\*\\*\\* and \\*\\*\\*\\* (insert any insult in your own language). But God forbid you to answer something like... that their parents raised them badly - otherwise you will lose honor, and the offender will lose... hmmm - nothing. A samurai has no goal, only a path - endure it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, of course, it's good that the company is trying to fight toxicity, but these guys are missing a few important points: not considering the severity of the offense, but considering group bullying. This is not the way the game should go.",

If someone is being toxic best you can do is mute them in game and go on with life these days. I personally have been getting many more feedback reports lately, nearly every time I log in I get one so I don't know if there is a bug or they are actually addressing more reports.",

Many many more times than that we had a person freakout after loading screen scouting seeing we were a 4 stack, despite us posting the discord in the lobby. Vast majority of the time it was fine, they just noticably lagged behind in coordination given the pins vs vc planning.\n\nGranted, I'm somewhat less toxic than the average league player, and so are my friends. I have no trouble believing there was issues with the format.",

I played a game today where I was trolled by 2 people, like legit inting and ruining the fun. Reporting after game wasn't enough, so I wrote a ticket. It got answered in 3h, and right after I finished my game they sent another report feedback, but this time the text was different. If you really think someone deserves to be banned for trolling, and by trolling I mean trolling for real, it's just better to send a ticket.",

For years it was nearly daily, sometimes after not even dying, but just getting out farmed, or being slow to roam. \n\nI also wanted to add a note to the thread without editing my earlier comments, just logged in and got a \"REPORT FEEEBACK\" from riot about having PLAYED with somebody who deserved a report and not reporting them. It reads \"Thanks to another player's report, we've issued a penalty for a player abusing text chat in one of your recent games. We encourage you to use our reports to help us keep our community safe!\" I shit you not. I doubt they are fake lmao.",

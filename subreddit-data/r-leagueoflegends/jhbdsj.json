He was considered the reason why GRF bombed so hard at Worlds because other top tier laners just manhandled him. The man reason why is he is so hated though is because it is commonly believed that he accused GRF coach cvMax of being physically abusive against him. However these accusations mysteriously came to light only after cvMax decided to bench Sword for Doran. A vast majority of the GRF staff came out in defense of cvMax, but Sword complained very hard to upper Griffin management and got cvMax suspended and Sword ended up playing for the team at worlds instead of Doran. After this incident, GRF imploded and only Sword and Tarzan remained. People blame Sword for blowing up the GRF roster because he couldn't handle being benched and they accused him of making up the abuse story so he can get cvMax kicked and remain the starting top laner. The case of whether not cvMax was abusive is still up in the air, but most people tend to lean towards the side that Sword was making it up.",

Not all good domestic players get the international success they want. \n\nIt's a bit surprising though Bjergsen would rather retire than go to a worse NA team or back to LEC. He really must have felt he can't get better than he was anymore. That he's past his prime, that or co-ownership is too good to let go.\n\nIf that's how he feels, then I respect him for making that hard decision also allowing a new player to grow in TSM. I'm excited to what he brings as a coach.\n\nClearlove also retired without the Worlds success he craved, but he didn't want to take up younger player spot. He did win MSI. I love that they both transitioned to coaches.",

So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as Bjerg would rather retire than go elsewhere \u2014 it just makes way too much sense to not leave this kind of long-term stability behind.",

After the lucian play to go out of groups the team lost all mental fortitude and NA saw their chance to have a competitive international team fail. \n\nOutside of C9 I don't think the region ever really recovered from the disappointment and if TSM gets out of groups as first seed I think the landscape of North American league is insanely different right now",

I am sure if they managed to pull off a good world's run it would have motivated him to stay a little longer.\n\nEdit: \n\nDL said on stream he only found out when Bjergsen made his final decision about 10 days ago.

Seeing Bjergsen finally \"give up\" is... defeating, like reality's gravity finally pushing you to the ground. All the more shocking because he just had such a great split in NA. I certainly hoped he went out on a better note. Not sure what to say except that I hope history is kind to his career, for my money he's easily the NA GOAT, whatever that's worth.

I hated how good you made TSM and how dominant you made the team in NA. I would feel a special type of euphoria when my original team, CLG, managed to beat you in Madison Sqaure Gardennfor the first time. I have yet to ever feel that type of way from a competitive league game. You made the gsme worth watching in NA. You were the benchmark for play for such a long time. I respect what you brought to the region, what you endured from its fans and their expectations, and the lasting impact on professional lol in NA you certainly have made. Good luck as head coach.

It's always the same excuse as to why he is taking so long but Udyr that they had to give a ton of models and work on his skins took way less time than him. I thought ASUs were supposed to be way faster and a happen lot more during the year. With this rate, champions like Cho'gath will only be reworked on 2035...",

Their main claim has always been that the infrastructure is not there and cannot support the changes we want. It's time for LoL 2, i.e., a platform they can fix and update in timely and modern fashion. I don't know if that will ever happen.",

In addition I'd argue that reworking a champ is probably *more* difficult than creating a new champ, as you have much tighter restrictions to work within whilst still maintaining the original feel of the champ.\n\nCross team work at a place the size of riot is going to be a nightmare I imagine. Rework team needs to come up with a theme, kit, identity etc (which could take *months* by itself), then needs to be shuttled off the arts team for prototyping. If it comes back and rework team aren't happy then there needs to be more prototypes or the original rework theme needs to be reconsidered. \n\nOn top of this it isn't like the arts team is just waiting for the rework team to contact them, they have plenty of other work to do as well, so they fit in the prototyping around ongoing work when they hear from the rework team which is going to extend how long things take.\n\nNow imagine all of the above, but for the rework team, arts team, kit team, animations team, balance team, etc, and it's easy to imagine how these things can take months or even over a year.\n\nAgain this is all just guesswork, unless someone internal at riot comes out and tells us whats going on then we'll never know. Notice also how I'm not saying that it's a good thing or it's acceptable for reworks to take as long as they do, merely pointing out reasons why it make take this long.",

If I am your design lead and I tell you \"I want a revamped Lee sin Q.\" Then before you, my particle effects person, can begin making the particle effects, you need to know how the spell is supposed to interact. Things like particle width, particle lifetime, looping effects, is there a special effect on hit, how should it look as it fizzles out on a miss, etc. But before you, my particle effect person, can begun making that you need to wait for me to sit down with our concept artists so I can get a unified vision of the spell on paper for you to replicate. So until I have that you are \"blocked\" on that job and need to do other jobs, maybe you are working on particle effects for a new ezreal skin in the meantime and you have a backlog of work to do. So you spend 2 or 3 months working in effects for other jobs that have been in your backlog since before I could even unblock you before you can start working on my Lee sin q.\n\nIt's not like riot stops working in every previous thing in their pipeline just because they say they're going to do a rework.",

Before they can be coded they need to be conceptualized. Before they can be conceptualized you need to come to an agreement on what the core identity of the champion is. Before you can come up with the core identity you need to search through forums of players who play those champs to get input on what matters the most to those players.\n\nLet's say that you realize what you are doing will not work halfway through coding. You are going to get kicked back 2 or 3 stages of development.",

All you\u2019re doing is explaining the process when it doesn\u2019t matter. This isn\u2019t some small start up company with a team of 6 people. This is one of the largest games in the world, this is a billion dollar company. No amount of explaining the process of updating a champions model will excuse the fact that riot has consistently underdelivered. The game literally has 2 maps and whenever they try introducing a new mode or Event it\u2019s always infested with game breaking code and never polished. Just look at the disaster that is clash, another half baked product by yours truly. \n\nThere\u2019s a core issue at riot somewhere that is causing this. No one would be complaining if riot simply didn\u2019t make promises they can\u2019t keep and treat their player base like garbage. The whole game should just be scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up. Take vex for example, a champ that took a ton of extra time and resources because of her \u201cunique and complex\u201d design of having an animated shadow but at least it was a new champ and unique. Leesin and teemo are flagship champions that have been around for years like you mentioned. There\u2019s no designing of a champions kit and abilities, theme, lore ect. These are 2 fleshed out iconic characters that are receiving a visual update and you want me to believe that it should take as long as it is? \n\n\u201cBefore you can come up with the core identity you need to search through forums of players who play those champs to get input on what matters the most to those players.\u201d \n\nWhat game have you been playing? Since when has riot sifted through forums of champ mains and took their input and feedback seriously? I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re being serious or not but I\u2019ll pretend that you are. Riot doesn\u2019t give a shit about people who are passionate enough to main a champ and learn the ins and outs of the champ and dedicate hours of their time to them.  Go look at almost any r/ champ main subreddit and you\u2019ll see nothing but tons of dedicated mains posting great ideas and balance changes (not all of them, most of them are just ridiculous). It literally takes petitions and  thousands of people all begging to riot when something as simple as a new skin for a champ comes out but has a glaring cosmetic issue. Take for example the lancer paragon blitzcrank skin, when the skin was announced people begged riot to change his walk animation. The skin has no legs and he is supposed to be hovering but uses the base walk animation of blitzcrank and looks ridiculous. Riot refused the communities request and even refused to make a compromise by just copy and pasting a walk animation from one of his other skins (I believe it was the irobot skin) over onto the new one because of \u201cvisual Clarity issues\u201d which is absurd now in the present with the skins and champions we have today that look almost identical, hell even certain ward skins look like a champ when sweeping. Nothing but excuses from a dog shit company at every turn. \n\nRiot cares about two things only and that\u2019s money and what champion gets played too much in pro play so they can knee cap whatever problematic champ out of existence so they can retain what little viewership they have that\u2019s getting tired of seeing the same 10 champions every game.",

Sure, that'll take some time but are they really claiming they are taking their full 1-3 year skin development time redoing skins that already exist? Re-brainstorming and conceptualizing everything? I doubt it. It sounds more like all their texture/vfx/splash artists have a massive backlog of skin and vgu work to do for many years to come rather than it being nebulously \"hard\" to fix a champ.

They might give you some PR answer, but the reality is, there is for sure way less people working on League.\n\nAlso, imagine you are Riot and you hire a great talented insane game dev. Are you gonna put him on the game that already peaked and is only slowly dying as not as many new people are coming in, or will you put the dev on some new project which gives him more freedom of work, more money, and also in general requires more work to be done, so for sure they will put the dev in that game.",

Many people have quit in recent months/years due to the scandals/end of WFH policies amongst other things. \n\nThe current Game Modes team has *nobody* on their team currently that even worked on the first Spellbook run in *2021.* That is an insane turnover no matter the industry, and these people they're bringing in, whether they're fresh out of University or they have 20+ years experience in the field, need training up, need testing and need experience working *within Riot.* \n\nSo there is likely roughly the same amount of people working on League directly, just the experience levels have plummeted down to a lot of factors.",

I'm saying plan things out and ramp up pods as needed so there's a new one every 2 months, even if it takes 12 months to work on or something.  So every 2 months, start a 12 month project on a different VGU and in a year, they'll start coming out.  \n\nCadence for the end user should be 2 months between the game getting something fresh, not for the dev team.",

It simply does not take a year to crank out any visual update unless one of two things is true:\n\n1. The developers on the team do not know how to use industry standard tools.\n1.  The developers, teams, and resources behind visual updates are being mismanaged.\n\nNow I can't speak for Riot's internal processes, but judging by the speed of these, it's safe to say that champion updates are a low priority *at best*. What's more likely the issue is that the same people doing modeling work for updated champions are also the ones doing modeling for skins, and out of the two of those it's obvious to see where the focus would be.",

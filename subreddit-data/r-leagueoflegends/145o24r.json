    "postText": "Hey I was wondering what peoples \"Rule of Thumb\" is when jungling and going for ganks  \nDo you:\n\n* Focus on Winning/easier kill lanes to try to make a fed carry (Carry being anyone massively ahead not specifically ADC)\n* Focus on helping your behind lanes in a hope to bring them back into the game (or keep them from brain booming)\n* Try to spread out across all lanes regardless of Winning/Losing lane\n\nObviously, this is a gross over-simplification as you might have the stars align for a easy gank. Theres also many points where ganking isnt the play at all. I was just wondering what the consensus of the community would be as I've heard all of these points argued for in some way or another.   \n\n\nVise versa, as Top/Mid/Bot which of those options would you prefer your Jungler to prioritize in your games? \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/145o24r)",

You basically just want to gank where they are likely to be effective or likely to succeed.\n\nIn the current meta botlane ganks generally give better reward than sololane ganks, but it's not always that simple.",

Generally ganking or diving for a winning lane will get your team greater rewards than doing so for a losing lane, i.e more tower plates, first tower gold, objectives, enemy jungle camps, and better players will establish vision control if they have control of the lane, especially botside. And since the enemy jungler is more likely to be playing around his winning lanes, trying to gank for a losing teammate is more likely to result in a countergank and a lost 2v2/3v3 in higher ranks. If the enemy jungler shows elsewhere and your losing teammate is not so behind that you can get 1v2d or 2v3d it can be correct to go for it if you won't lose too much on the other side of the map, but there's a reason 'don't gank losing lanes' is a rule of thumb",

And in about 70% of cases you'd still be better off not helping them if they're losing early. \n\nYou're a Kayn with an Annie mid for example. Your garen dies to Darius level 1, tps back, and dies again.\n\nThat garens probably tilted af and will be tilted even more if you come top and die 2v1. Which would happen if Darius spends his gold and plays his lane properly.\n\nIf you instead focus on getting the 0-0-0 Annie a lead, and powering yourself up in the process, the 2 of you can roam top together at her 6 and neutralize the threat",

I mean yes it's right you gank winning Lanes but winning Lanes are probably pushing for Drake Prio so you probably Dive and not Gank. However if you spamgank everywhere, you will get abused by CS so hard you can't even play if the other jungler has atleast 1 Hand and a half Eye. Watch like how Agurin gets every Season Rank 1 and you know what i'm talking about. Perma fullclear into only 100% Ganks or Dives. If alot is winning he keeps powerfarming to get himself ahead because he knews the other Jungler has to try somehting or else Enemy Team cant win anymore. So Enemyjungler will waste time pretty often. So its not all about ganking. There is a reason why River Shen isnt playd lmao",

Ganking lanes that are losing hard often results in just feeding them more or failing to kill.\n\nIf top laner is down by 2+ kills I usually consider the lane over and ungankable. Most top laners are pretty oppressive so if you try to gank them when your top lane is down an item or 1-2 levels, you probably just get doubled killed and feed them more. Not worth it even to make your top laner feel better.\n\nGanking behind mids is more feasible since they are often squisher heroes, so if you have some cc to chain it's possible to not get 1v2'ed.\n\nGanking losing bottom lanes can work sometimes as well, especially if the mid roams.",

A GP with shutdown gold and  a large chunk of HP missing?

And not sure how he would improve that much in NA tier 2 at its weakest role. Also, mid pool in NA has for sure gotten better, at least at the top end. Who of Gori, Emenes, Vicla, Palafox, Jojopyun, Jensen (yes he had a good split despite his team) is he clearly better than? I could also see Quid (we don't know much about him) or Haeri being better, I don't think he looked better than Haeri in academy last summer. Best I could see is him being 7th best in current league and I'm not even convinced of that\n\nEdit: also, he's pretty lucky for this spring-summer offseason, because Maple and Bjergsen are for sure better than him.",

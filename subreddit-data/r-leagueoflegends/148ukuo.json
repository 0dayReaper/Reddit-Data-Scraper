    "postText": "Hey guys, I dont often use reddit but I have read the new post saying how theres gonna be a new rank called emerald. As a plat player im all for it, but i heard they are gonna be distributing the players. Is that going to happen in second split or end of season. I assume that means I will be emerald next split? Sorry I dont know how to ask so I apologize if this is a dumb q.",

Thats why they increased lp gains/losses.  I expect we're doing placements again.  Emerald tier will probably  consist of plat 3-1 players at the moment, they mentioned that skill level for d4 shouldnt be changing.",

I know it's not that simple because people push for rank ups and stop playing, but yeah",

    "postText": "There's a lot of things wrong with the \"pacing\" of this game... or this game in its entirety, but I think that one of the primary things that needs to be changed/reworked is the LP and MMR system. This isn't just some personal rant because I lost a few games, this is a genuine issue that I feel gets overlooked. I'm not the only person with a positive win rate that loses more LP than gaining, and it's been this way ever since I started playing ranked. I know very well that I'm not the only person who has had many games where they stomp in their lane only to look elsewhere and see that everybody else on the enemy team is fed while their teammates are tilting and flaming each other inevitably ending in getting shutdown and repeatedly slain by everybody on the enemy team until the game is straight up lost. I understand that this is a team game, but why are players constantly getting punished for playing as best as they can with the teammates that they're given? Inters, feeders, griefers, etc. All forcing a loss onto you just because they're having a bad day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe amount of LP you gain and/or lose should be based off of your general performance in the match, the same way you get a letter grade. If you have good vision score, CS, damage to champions and objectives, healing towards teammates, etc, you should be rewarded by gaining more LP if its a win and losing less LP if its a loss. In the same way, you should gain less LP if its a win and lose more LP if its a loss if you had a bad performance within the match. There are so many genuinely good players that are stuck in Gold, Silver, or even Bronze because they have bad luck with their teammates, with many players getting frustrated by this and quitting playing ranked or playing the game entirely. Your rank should be based off of how good you are as a player, not how lucky/unlucky you get with teammates.  \n\n\nTL:DR; I believe the LP and MMR system should be reworked to reward players with good performance and punish players with bad performance within their matches, regardless of teammates and regardless of win or loss.",

            "comment": "The issue with making gains performance-based is that it would be gamed/min-maxed in an instant. KDA is taken into account? People will become far more KDA players. Vision score is taken into account? Wards will be placed wherever, just for a good vision score. Expect flame if somebody takes \"your\" ward kill. DMG dealt? Everybody now plays poke champs. CS? Expect (even more) flame if you go to somebody's lane/\"steal\" their CS. Grades for example already encourage a CS heavy &amp; KDA player playstyle. \n\nThe only non-gameable objective is wins, because that's the game's objective in the first place.",

And that expresses it self through your winrate. And guess what: you're already gaining LP for a win and losing it for a loss, so your average LP gain per game is dependent on your winrate! (and on your MMR vs Rank, which also comes back to being dependent on your winrate). \n\nYou say the system needs a rework, but it's already the best it can be to achieve what you ask of it. \n\nYou just want faster, easier LP. And what I think you really want, however, is to gain more LP based on your KDA or some shit, because you believe you should be rewarded for what you think is \"performing well\" on games you lose. But that's bs: if your performance doesnt turn a loss into a win, you don't get to claim reward for it.",

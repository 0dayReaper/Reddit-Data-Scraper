    "postText": "You see it pretty often, and I'm fairly certain there's been more than a few people doing YouTube series of just, like, 'Splitpush to Masters' or whatever. All it takes is a team with a little bit of pressure and a (optimally) tanky AD champ top lane to afk and hit turrets. Usually you will see it on Sions, since he stacks HP and has two health bars (kinda) to throw at turrets, but recently I've seen Volibears go top to do it (his ultimate I assume) and of course Illaoi and Tryndamere have been splitpushers since their inceptions.  \n\n\nMy main issue with it is that it's literally non-stop pressure in the top lane, and it wouldn't be a huge issue if having your top laner there countered that pressure, but often times these champions will be *un***GODLY** difficult to do any meaningful damage to, have ways to heal their health back absurdly fast/easily, or straight up just 1-shot anyone who tries to stop them because Tanks With Bonus HP Scaling Of 50% Or More Are Okay\u2122. God forbid they build a Hullbreaker, making them functionally immortal save for your ***entire team*** going to stop them. And in a lot of cases (Tryndamere, being the biggest), they just run the moment someone shows up and are actually impossible to catch with non-existent cooldowns on their mobility skills, usually paired with Ghost and Magical Footwear. Then they just show back up 15 seconds later once your attention is on something else important, such as Baron, Soul Drake, Elder, etc. There are a ton of team comps you can run that are good enough at stalling/denying a fight 4v5 that the splitpusher just gets to run it down to the Nexus uncontested and there is *actually no way to stop it if they decide to do it.*  \n\n\nIt's boring. It's non-gameplay. It's way too effective for how little consequence it provides. I even see plenty of high ELO people say it's too strong. So now the ball is in Riot's court. Will they bring it in line with actually playing the damn game, or will they ignore it since you don't see it in LCS's 12 minute games that are over after one teamfight? :T",

You sitting in a lane never leaving means your team never has prio for dragons and your team will get clapped 4v5 before you manage to make a significant dent into the enemy base. Unless your team was clapping all early game that they don\u2019t need you, splitpushing just isn\u2019t a strong strat in this meta.",

It's far from dead, and if anything the recent buffs to Hullbreaker (Why, Riot?) are going to make it even more prevalent.   \n\n\nAs for 'too little reward', the champs who generally do splitpush are extremely good at clearing waves and have ways to either disable turrets or build so tanky that they just ignore them. Teamfights themselves are a gamble. They might make your team a nice lead, but they might give the enemy team a lead also. You know what always gives you team an advantage with no downside? Global gold from turrets and objective bounties. Couple that with the way most of them play being more or less 'do what you must, I have already won' 0-10 worth less gold than a melee minion, as well as taking at least 3 people to even kill? Yeah. I'd say it provides plenty for your team. You cannot simply ignore them, and fighting them gives the enemy team huge numbers advantages everywhere else.",

                    "comment": "In the situation that prompted me to make this post, there was a Volibear who was, at one point, 0-6, and was worth a shutdown when I killed him because of how much minion and objective gold he got. Our team was not ignoring him. Nor were we ignoring objectives. The issue we had is that he, along with many other splitpushers, was extremely difficult to dissuade from just sitting on a tower and auto attacking it. Because of Demolish and items like Rageblade comboing with his passive, he was able to take an entire turret from full to dead in about 1.5 minion waves. Contesting him only made it take maybe one wave longer, if he wasn't managed to be killed. Nobody on our team could 1v1 him. And even if they could, he would simply choose to not fight them anyway and just hit the turret. Only the turret. Nothing but the turret. Killing him was a herculean feat and was rarely worth the effort to do so outside of protecting our base from him because he never fought back so he was never worth any gold.  \n\n\nAnd then he bought a GA. :T  \n\n\nSo you see, my point is that you can absolutely do everything to try and prevent a splitpusher but unless your team is ahead to the point that a 5v4 (which should already be in your favor) is an absolute stomp, the splitpusher will just splitpush, and make up for their lack of presence on the rest of the map with boatloads of gold for their team in objectives, pressure from map control, and just how many people are required to fucking stop them from being a piece of shit in the first place.  \n\n\nIt's especially egregious with people like Sion, who become exponentially more difficult to kill as the seconds tick away and he has, like I mentioned, basically two of his ENORMOUS health bars to throw at turrets, the second one being even more effective at it due to the huge increase in attack speed. Suicide Sion is the most viable way to play the bastard, and I hate it.",

All this takes away from the decision making of when and when to not Split push, especially when you have champions that literally stop caring about their deaths like Sion while still being way too hard to kill. A player should be forced to choose between Split pushing and grouping, not be incentivized to brainlessly run it down one lane and not give a shut about what happens to your teammates or engaging in teamfights. This is just bad design and the concept should be overhauled.",

There are characters like Evelynn and Blue Kayn that are literally designed to punish ppl splitpushing off position. \n\nThe only problem with this IMO is that demolish rune is a joke. It should be designed for actual split push characters. Instead here comes full tank sion / cho'gath or any other hp stacking full tank items character, dealing 50% of the turret health with it. It's just bad design, it shouldn't scale with bonus hp only. \n\nNot only those characters are much harder to kill while splitting, but also usually they do more damage to the turret short term, than actual designed splitpushers.",

Even with Grudge, and Cleaver, and Goredrinker, and 3 levels up on them, with like 20 stacks of Dark Harvest... you just aren't allowed to deal any damage to them, and they will summarily 1) Ignore you and just hit the turret anyway, or 2) Kill you in 2-5 hits, because tanks (and juggernauts) deal a ton of damage for... whatever reason.  \n\n\nOnly way I ever have any way to deal with one of those is by going Rhaast instead which is still fine with the Blue Kayn build and runes, but it's a lot harder to deal with most other currently popular champs from other roles, with their 14 dashes and blinks and moe speed buffs and 90 billion damage in 1.2 seconds.",

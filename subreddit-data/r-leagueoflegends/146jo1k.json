    "postText": " I pretty regularly play normals because ranked stresses me tf out, but lately idk what been going on but my games have really sucked. I was trying to learn a troll AD Morgana build for a bit (miss ad yuumi mid, used to have a decent winrate on it suprisingly before they reworked) and my games have gotten horrible even after stopping queuing for ad morgana mid. Is there a troll queue or something, because out of the last 10 games I've played, 8 time someone dc'ed within 8 mins of the match starting, most games FF15, and both teams were super toxic in all chat. Is this just me, or is this something people have also been noticing? ",

Whenever I wide flank in valorant from the start of the match with a shorty, I don't get told to kms by both teams in all chat, yet I do even when playing meta stuff, like Azir. This toxicity has gotten even worse for me lately, and I've had to take a couple breaks for my mental health and while I love this game, if this keeps going I either quit or actually kms.",

I'm never toxic, and I only get a toxic teammate maybe once in 6 or 7 games.\n\nUsually the toxic guys are better than their rank and just are stuck lower than they should be because of mental weakness. Half the time I can pull them back from the cliff and we pull off a win. \n\nI definitely think there's a queue for people who get reported for toxicity+ a lot.",

It happens way too often that I get blamed and reported for losses while im the only one doing well in the team.... but my pick is the problem...  \n\n\nPeople used to be so chill. AP Udyr bot? cool! full AP Sona mid? nice! adc janna top? interesting!  \n\n\nnow people cry if they haven't seen an asian pro team play your pick on the specific role with the exact item build.",

She will just be back to awful in solo queue while still being picked in pro play.\n\nSeriously I don't know how Riot gets out of this one. I can't see any easy path forward.\n\nYou know what I honestly think might happen? Riot will ban this champion for pro play only within the next year. They will cite that Yuumi is a champion for beginner's and serves a different purpose than pro play. This is my prediction. It will be quite a historic event.",

Riot clearly doesn\u2019t want to just clap her down to the point of utter uselessness, but as long as she can remain as a permanently intangible backpack and extra item for a carry, she will never not be broken in pro. Yet her design is *so ingrained* in this playstyle that they just can\u2019t change it. Barring a full rework, which I honestly expect at this point.",

Shes not a noob friendly champ because shes meant to teach them some mechanics without having to bother with others (positioning and movement). I believe shes meant to introduce league to non-players. Like a friend asks their friend if they want to play LoL but the asked friend doesnt really play so the friend whos experienced can just tell them to hop on yuumi.  In that regard i think the hop on mechanic works. Problem is its ass for everybody who plays regularly. I dont think she'll be reworked.  I think she actually draws in new players whoch is good for the game. I think the balance team is just gonna have to come to terms with the fact that she cant be balanced for both new players and regulars. Riots just gotta olaf her and have her only be played by new players.",

When I think of yuumis design I'm not thinking about a player who is familiar with gaming and wants to improve at league, I'm thinking of the player who maybe plays the game once or twice a week with friends and will never touch the game otherwise. \n\nIn that respect, I think yuumis design works. the problem is that her numbers are good enough to where the good players try to play her as well. I think she achieved her purpose better in the gutted state before the rework.",

There's no counterplay to not being able to damage or interact AT ALL with Yuumi.  \nThen there's the Leviathan-problem (the old stackable item):  \n[What is Yuumis weakness? Her ADC dying. What does Yuumi prevent? Her ADC dying.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=52BhRt7lY6Q&amp;t=70)  \nAnd finally which is arguably why Yuumi is so completely broken: She get's free gold in the vicinity of about 2000 gold, which she doesn't have to pay with her kit strength for. She does not have to buy boots which is between 1000-1100 gold she doesn't have to spend which other supports have to and she does not have to take the flash summoner and can take a combat summoner which I value at about 800-900 gold (judging by the price of stopwatch and quicksilver sash I'd say that's a fair estimation).",

It isn't gamers who are comfortable playing PC games, that happen to be starting LoL. It is people who have never touched a PC game in their life and aren't even used to gaming with a mouse. It's a surprisingly larger audience than you think when it comes to certain games, and LoL is one of them.\n\nDo you remember what it was like to pick up a console controller for the first time? Remember what it was like the first time you turned on a car and started learning to drive? Or perhaps, imagine playing LoL using a track pad on a laptop. Imagine what it's like to have only ever played videogames via a touchscreen device or a console and now you have to use a mouse + keyboard.\n\nUsing a mouse is a skill. Gaming is a slill. LoL itself is a vast skill with a lot of depth. Most of us grew up as kids able to learn how to game in general, how to use a mouse, etc and take it for granted. There's now a whole generation and beyond that have barely if ever played games using a mouse, as well as people who never owned a gaming PC but are now moving to that instead of consoles.\n\nThat's who Yuumi is for. The people who DO need handholding, ARE essentially babies when it comes to videogames and/or t using the tool you play them with, and don't have either the time or patience to learn all the skills required all at once.\n\nI think most people on Reddit take for granted how much they know about gaming, LoL, and using various controls. Try to teach your 80 year old grandma who has never touched a videogame in her life to play LoL and you will know what the Yuumi target audience plays like.",

The end. \n\nYuumi exists entirely for people playing the game with their gf or bf who don't actually play League, so they can play Yuumi without actually having to play League of Legends, but they still get to spend time with their partner doing their hobby.\n\nIt's a girlfriend champ, and it gets alot of girls to try League with their boyfriends. They're not going to remove that, it accomplishes the goal of the champ: Getting people into League who wouldn't otherwise play if they had to actually play the game.",

He can then psychically jump on team mates to give them a small shield and shoot little skill shots while being hidden away somewhere.  \nThe downside is that he is very fragile and if your real body is found while your looking at your team mate (because that\u2019s where you are using your abilities) you will die very quickly.  \nI think it\u2019s well balanced and thought out as you are actually targetable (unless you stay in base but then you\u2019re not soaking xp) but you still have a cross map effect.  \nWhat riot did was completely remove the dangers and create a completely imbalanced scenario.  \nHotS is one of those games that I wish did better as I think it\u2019s better balanced, more fun, more build diversity and fixes so many issues that league has. Sadly it just doesn\u2019t feel as good to play and the rotation of maps is frustrating for some.",

And he loved it. Eventually he then learned Enough to graduate to start playing his own champs like Magni, but ChoGall had a lot to teach him. Things like combining our ults together, working together to make our rune bombs work, what talents to get and when.

There's more to the new player experience than \"how much do you learn from this champion\". If you had a friend start playing league in recent times you'd know the barrier to entry is abysmally high. It makes sense to have a champion with a significantly lower barrier of entry so they can be eased into the game.\n\nBy your definition the perfect new player champion would be something like Riven. You can learn animation canceling, combos, spacing, etc. But obviously this is not the best champion for a beginner, and instead you might recommend something like Lux, which teaches you significantly less about the game, but is easier to pick up.",

A core mechanic for adcs. \n\nW teaches positioning, because you learn very quickly to use it properly you need to put yourself in a spot that maximizes its effectiveness. It wont take long for a new player to learn to position themselves to hit the enemy, but also it wont take long for them to realize that the opponent can use the minion wave to block, which also helps to teach positioning through a negative feedback loop.\n\nE teaches the importance of vision. Its a first step towards warding. \n\nAnd the ult is good for teaching trading, engaging, and disengaging, as it will likely be used point blank for new players. The natural response to learning that you have a stun that does big damage with no range limit? Hit the enemy with it when they're half health to kill them. To do that, the logical learning step is to trade which teaches about good trading vs bad trading. \n\nImo Ashe is an excelent beginner champ, atleast for learning laning.",

If hitting a 5 man ult doesn't make a difference, if her heal/shield is so weak it doesn't have impact. You learn nothing from playing well/bad if there is no difference in outcome.\n\nBut thinking about it, a good learning tool would be a Yuumi that can just hop on and do nothing at all as a 6th player. But the \"host\" can decide to give her control over his spells, or active items or movement, so you can try to practice one aspect at a time as a new player. But ofc this only works with a very close duo.",

Skills like animation cancelling are advanced skills which can be learned later, but movement and positioning in particular are such key skills that literally every other champion has to do, but not yuumi. \n\nSo yes, Riven is a bad choice for a new player champion because she's *too* complicated, but yuumi is *too* simple, and lacks truly integral mechanics which every player needs to learn, champions like lux or annie are complex enough to teach the core skills, while still being easy to learn and not overwhelming a new player with complex mechanics.",

Their definition would not necessarily assume Riven is the best champion to learn the game.\n\nWhat you need is a simple champion that lets you focus on the fundamentals instead of getting bogged down by specific champion mechanics. Riven is guilty of this as you say, but so is Yuumi.\n\nYou need to learn the fundamental skills as a beginner. Farming, positioning, spacing, dodging, harassing while not getting harassed. All that stuff.\n\nThis is why a champion like Lux or Annie is great for this. They are simple to understand and to play and they function like most other champions. The skills translate to the vast majority of other champions. Yuumi's doesn't.\n\nIn general, new players should never play super specialized unique champions if they want to learn the basics.",

Even if they find a way to make her balanced, it'd still be bad design and harms the game more than it helps it.\n\nI would like to see them rework that gimmick to be her ultimate and be a temporary effect. So, perhaps, her ult is that she latches onto a teammate for 5 seconds and she gets to cast a supercharged version of Q, W, or E (like heimer where she has to pick which one she wants), such as making her Q into her current ult, W into an ability where she dashes very quickly between all nearby teammates to give them additional passive defenses (armor/mr) or E to give teammates a big heal. \n\nThen you can rework her Q, W, and E to be used when she isn't latched onto to people since now she'll almost never be latched onto people. I think her W should still allow her to quickly jump from ally to ally, so that's an easy one.",

In HotS, Structures lost interactable mechanics, they reworked every single siege/map control character, and started releasing a bunch of characters with dashes, resets, and oneshots.  Mobility creep got so bad that they just blanket buffed every character's base movespeed universally.  Traditionally the balancing point for raw hero-killer dps characters was poor pve (waveclear/push/structure manip/dmg), but they kept nerfing the value of pve and stripping it away from characters who traditionally had it (including some tanks and ALL healers losing any waveclear or objective-dmg builds they had).  In addition, they removed the distinction between healers who are generic healers, or prefer healing over long periods of time, and in-combat healers.  Almost all healers were reworked to scale their healing with combat situations (Damage dealt to heroes, damage taken by heroes).",

If Yuumi is really supposed to be for new players to \u201clearn\u201d then it makes absolutely 0 sense that it is allowed in competitive soloqueue games, yet alone pro play.

Yuumi should be just like that, but instead becomes stronger while climbing up, with her apex being professional play.",

Which is why the honour shop hasn't been rotated once ever, why the micro transactions got worse and more ingrained, why more skins get released every 2 months even though not needed, which is why champions overhauls (side eyeing Skarner there) take an obnoxious time: they are not profitable. The time when Riot Games was a company dedicated to the players is long gone. \n\nAnd be happy: the champ designs will remain toxic, hypermobile, damage overloaded kits with way too much sustain or tankiness (or both) that are made for the cringe main character syndrome players that infested the game. \n\nThe game has never been in a worse condition than now and Riot clearly jumped ship. We're the most dedicated community and the biggest eSports, but as we're not the focus anymore and only a cash cow, they don't really put much effort into balancing and game design",

I also don't like the idea that simply because she has 100% prescence it means the rework failed, I think there's a lot more to it. Tbh the nature of her kit is one that if her numbers are ever even remotely passable and items are in a good spot, she will always be viable.

[Here is a link to his comment for those interested.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/14464fg/when_is_the_yuumi_rework_that_was_supposed_to/jnfpy66/?context=3)\n\nMy problem with Phreak's argument is this:\n\n- He takes into account other region data to skew the data in his favor. If we look at exclusively the top leagues in the world (LCK and LPL), Yuumi is super prioritized and is winning a ton of games.\n Even if you consider only LPL and LCK there are also interpretative issues with the data (see points below).\n\n- LPL plays way more games than LCK which biases the data. Since Yuumi has a lower presence in LPL than LCK, this sways the data. If LCK played more games than LPL, Yuumi's stats would look different. You cannot look at champion data like that without taking into account regional differences.\n\n- To illustrate my point above: LPL has played 88 games in Summer 2023. Imagine if LCK had played that many games (spoiler: Yuumi presence would be way higher). \n\n- Now you could argue that LPL not picking Yuumi as much is meaningful (and I agree), but we still need to consider how this regional preference biases the data. To do proper data analysis across regions, you would do a \"game-equivalent\" presence data point to correct for regional differences in amount of games played and thereby remove this bias.\n\n- If we don't do this correction, we implicitly assume that LPL is more than 3x more important than LCK in terms of data quality. I don't think people would buy that assumption. \n\nAnd most importantly: The stated goal for the Yuumi rework was to move her away from pro and towards casual players.\n\nYou don't get to say that your change was a success when Yuumi is looking insanely dominant in the best regions of the world. Yuumi does have lower presence in LPL as I stated, but she also has *75% winrate*. \n\nRight now Yuumi has 50% winrate according to Phreak's comment, but she is clearly very OP in pro play.\n\nSo what does that mean? \n\n**- Yuumi has to be nerfed to dogshit winrate in solo queue to be balanced for competitive play. This obviously means that Yuumi changes failed because she has to suck for casual players to not ruin pro play.**",

You *could* argue that the LPL is drafting better, based on this data, or that the LCK read on her value as a pick is too high, but the only champions that sort of fit into her stats are Poppy, Gwen, and Xayah, all very much more \"counterpick\" champions whose winrates should be higher than average. I don't think Yuumi should be running 75% wr as a blind pickable champ.\n\nShe's also banned in 20% of Silver+ games (% increases the higher elo you go), so now you have a strong possibility the noob friend you're trying to get into League by duoing with Yuumi won't even get to play her.",

The champion is unfun to watch, unfun to play and unfun to play against. Should be sitting at 40% winrate and used by beginner only, not by proplayer who trained their whole life to just sit on their adc.",

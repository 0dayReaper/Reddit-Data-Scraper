    "postText": "So I was playing kata mid vs a neeko, Neeko ganks bot and i forget to ping, she gets 2 kills, Jungle gets so mad he starts pinging me all game. After getting Ult Neeko kills me so I decide to play it as safe as possible but farming becomes too rough and Neeko mostly dominates the lane while Jungle refuses to gank me. Moral of the story, the game is lost (low elo btw). Now, i understand my first mistake but was there anything i could do to remedy the situation? I did try to ask for gank but Jungle would just ping me and not listen.",

She has an aoe knock up ult that counters you. \n\nUnless you got fed early on then no one is to really blame. Let this game go.",

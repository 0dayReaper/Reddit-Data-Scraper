At Worlds, Zeka showed more versatility, but he's recently gotten the 2 trick label because he's been inting on non Akali/Sylas picks throughout the split. Stuff like his recent Gragas and Trist play has been atrocious, and even his non-int performances are nowhere near the peak he saw at Worlds, which leads to people calling him a 2 trick",

The top gap was of course the reason they lost, but if such a massive gap was apparent, shouldn\u2019t he have had all the more reason to take a carry role instead of staying on tanks all four games? The point is in internationals Chovy usually cruises by, not making any major mistakes nor actually taking any risks to win the game. To reiterate, it\u2019s not necessarily choking, just not living up to the hype he gets every single internationals, and if you were a casual viewer who watched pro play occasionally without any info on players coming in to the tournament, you\u2019d have no idea he is suppose to be the best player in the world as most people hype him up to be.",

Point is his international play is not memorable considering the praise he gets from everyone. I don\u2019t doubt the praise and hype he gets, he just hasn\u2019t lived up to it.",

Because Chovy carrying that HLE team to quarters is the single most impressive thing I've ever seen a pro player do. Morgan and Willer are quite possibly the two worst Koreans to ever play at worlds. And 2021 Deft looked like he was finished for most of the year.",

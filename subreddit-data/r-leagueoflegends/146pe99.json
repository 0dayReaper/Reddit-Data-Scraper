    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nJust a quick question that I can't find on the internet.\n\nAfter a period of time, you'll start to decay in ranked (only diamond at above), and the ranked ladder shows you how many days you've left before you start decaying. \n\nWhat I'm wondering though. How many games do I need to play in order for the rank decay to reset back to the approximate 30 day timer?\n\nThanks for clarifying.",

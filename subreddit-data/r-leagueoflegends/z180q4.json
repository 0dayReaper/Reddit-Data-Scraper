And it this has actually been bugged for months, where you toggle it off, but eternals still show up next time you die. So you actually have to press \"N\" after every death.\n\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous, especially considering even the most veteran players don't know what the fuck it means that Akshan has 30 \"Bad Day to be Bad\" unless they both play Akshan regularly and really care about eternals, which must be a ridiculously low % of the people playing. But no, everyone's gotta have like 10% of their screen covered in completely useless information.",

I leave it on cruise control and quickly grab a sandwich. When I come back, auto-pathing tells me I should contest the next dragon. Riot heard the complaints about the Dragon voting cluttering up screen space, so now players must vote to start the Dragon vote. I trigger this initial vote, but none of my teammates respond because they're vote restricted for spamming too many noose pings. In anger, I follow my teammates around and smite all their cannons. The game ends in a loss, but it wasn't all bad. Riot recognizes that my teammates were toxic, so they compensate me with the last bit of honor I need for level 5.",

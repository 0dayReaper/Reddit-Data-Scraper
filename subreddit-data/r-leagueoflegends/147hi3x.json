    "postText": "Its my first time touching rank and pushing to master. Once completing my diamond promos to master, will i have the full 14 days of banked games upon reaching master? (Considering that I already have 24 days in diamond) or do i have to play another few games in master to rebuild my banked games to prevent decay.",

            "comment": "Yes, your banked games carry over and you have 14 days of decay protection. \n\nYou also have 3 games of demote protection, so you could technically extend it to 5 weeks total by playing 1 game a week, if that's really what you wanted to do. However, I highly encourage playing. Don't be afraid of demoting :)",

    "postText": "I know I'm bad mechanically at this game. I'm almost 40 years old and my brain just can't work as fast as it did when I was younger and played dota on wc3. I stopped trying to climb in ranked because of, like everyone else will tell you, the trolls and helpless feeling sometimes that games are completely out of your control. So I started a challenge with myself to get M7 on all champs in ranked only and just have fun. I'm at 46 right now. When I started playing ahri I demoted to bronze from silver and had just met some friend from a class I'm taking. We started discussing ranks and they all said I was bad and deserved to be in bronze regardless of me explaining I'm not trying to climb. They were stuck on my rank being bronze so I suck. We then made a bet that I would try, for the first time in a year or so, to climb as high as I can and beat their ranks. They thought there is no way a bronze player would beat their ranks of gold. There are still two days left and I just hit plat for the first time. I'm pretty excited about it. I know I'm not good with ANY high mobility champs, my brain just can't see where I am and figure out what buttons to press quick enough. I play the most basic dumb champs but realized how important macro is and \"playing babysitter\" to the kids that tilt because a banana peel fell on the floor. Just a random post from a random guy. Love you all. Thanks for reading. Have a great day. Ign: gh0stFACEkller\n\nI'm a otp veigar when climbing. Slow old man veigar. \ud83d\udcaa",

That's where I was born, raised, grew up and some say I belong :) \n\nIt's nothing fancy. My first goal was to \"not die\". Literally thaat was it. Practicing not dying in lane is boring but the moment I started doing that I insta noticed a difference. And in regards to macro I just count how many enemies I see on the map and if 4 are bot and one top I shove mid as hard as possible or whatever lane everyone isnt in depending on the wave state. like how far its already pushed on its own. trying to realize when to rotate and when to push was the hardest. Most people get mad if you dont rotate regardless if you would have showed up after the fight was over and died yourself. but tbh there were times i should have rotated but didnt because I thought I wouldnt have made it there in time. So learning when to and when not to was the hardest for me.",

Practicing not dying in lane is boring but the moment I started doing that I insta noticed a difference.\n\nSooo many people need to learn this, i cannot count how many teammates i have in my gold 2 games that somehow have 10-14 deaths, i am astounded as to how that even happens. The highest amounts of deaths i get is 6, and that is a rarity for me, i usually average 2-4 deaths a game.  \n\n\nTo be fair I am used to playing toplane so you learn pretty fast that if you die once you have to play very defensively or you lose the lane very fast, and if you die twice the lane is gg and you usually need to hug the turret after that, which is why i am an advocate for saying that people must go through 10-20 games on toplane because you learn a lot that other lanes don't seem to get",

Some people don\u2019t train at all and just participate, some show up high or drunk, some just stop midway through the race because they just don\u2019t feel like finishing. And yeah the rest are people who care about winning and actually train because they\u2019re serious about it. \n\nThe only subset of the population you care about comparing yourself to is the serious person. Many ranked players don\u2019t play enough to get to their true rank, many just treat it casually or don\u2019t care about climbing, others have horrible mental that prevents them from climbing.

I guess its better than average? But if you're spamming 100s of ranked games season after season and ending up in platinum, you're probably dead average for how many games were played. Most people I know who even play just a handful of ranked games per season are mid silver at least and could probably hit gold if they tried. But they don't. Yet reddit says the platinum player who played 700 games in 6 months is high elo... \n\nAnd I'm not saying that to take away from the achievement. The game is really hard and its not easy to learn. Its definitely something you can be proud of. I'm just saying that being platinum doesn't mean you are in the top 15% of *talent*",

If 40+ year olds can still be pro at fighting games, a genre where you're often tasked with reacting to things happening at 20 frames, then age doesn't mean anything for LoL. The only thing that tends to change with it is time and effort investment and you don't have to be 40 to not have a lot of time to spend on this game.\n\nGold is just not impressive, it doesn't need to be impressive to be a meaningful personal achievement, march to the beat of your own drum, the nice thing about it is having reached a new individual milestone, there's not much prestigious about the rank itself.\n\nI don't like the stigma around age that surrounds this game in specific and has damaged the career of many pros who still had it in them, and I think we can appreciate achievements without creating a fake narrative about them being super hard to get",

Everyone were on such huge egos getting to gold 5-1 and comparing each others skill, champs, roles etc... No one even knew I sat comfy in D2 playing morgana mid and listening to them gave a lot of laughs :D\n\n(I had 2 accounts, the Diamond one I grinded on, and another at gold something to play either duo with a friend, or queue up with classmates in 5player norms, had to use 2 accounts, as some of my classmates were generally toxic in games and sorta bullies at school, it was simply easier to be offline and playing on an account no one has in the friends list, rather than deny invites (If some of you have toxic friends, you understand what I mean)).",

Started playing in S5 when I was 24 and was always drawn to heavily mechanic/flashy champions like Yasuo, Zed and Katarina. But because I started \"late\" and got introduced to the game by friends who were playing since season 1, I obviously knew very little about macro but was able to keep up with them in silver with better mechanics than I'd say most of them. \n\nHowever, I would often not know how to translate that to consistent wins. I still managed to get G5 (at the time) grinding way too many games.\n\nAs time went by and I had less time to play because of work and life in general, my mechanical skills started deteriorating and being 31 now I can tell you the difference is night and day as far as reflexes and eye to hand coordination go.\n\nI ended up changing roles to top lane and shifted to bruisers and eventually became the tank player I am today. And having to manage mechanics less actually allowed me to learn macro, wave management, tracking cooldowns, identifying win cons, etc. and have made it to plat on the last 4 seasons with waaaay less games than I did to get to gold.",

Enchanters also require very good timing for lots of their abilities to get the most value out of them which also comes under mechanics.\n\nAre they as mechanically intensive as something like an ADC, no obviously not, but an enchanter with terrible mechanics is just going to int and provide nothing.\n\nYuumi however......",

    "postText": "Hey,\n\nStarted playing this game around 2 weeks ago, and I mostly main Caitlyn and learning the ADC role. I Feel comfortable with her E&gt;Q/W&gt;Headshot basic combos, and wanted now to emphasize on optimizing my damage as much as possible, especially for punishing people getting on traps.\n\nI saw some videos about double headshots cancels, but looks like they are got patched not long time ago, so I am not sure if most of these videos are relevant anymore, and what should I do instead.\n\nAre there some recent guides that still relevant for now? Or if there are Caitlyn mains here who can share the optimal combos, especially the best way to punish people on traps, I'll be grateful.",

            "comment": "EQ and EW are the most important ones by far.\n\nFast trap is very useful (go auto-move-W-move-auto, it\u2019s WAY faster than auto-W-auto)\n\nAuto-&gt;headshot cancels still exist, but they\u2019re slower (they used to be basically instant, but now they\u2019re about the same speed as any auto cancel e.g Nasus auto-Q). Someone steps on a trap -&gt; you auto someone else, then click the headshot with the right timing, canceling the your auto winddown. You don\u2019t always want to do this; sometimes saving a few frames to kite better or burst one target is more important.\n\nWhen someone is about to stand on a trap within your auto range, rightclick them just before the trap triggers, and you\u2019ll auto-&gt;headshot cancel them automatically. You usually have time to go auto-headshot-Q, or auto-headshot-E-Q-headshot if you\u2019re close.\n\nWhen someone is about to stand on a trap at long range, Q-headshot is usually all you can do.\n\nThere are also net cancels that let you go E-auto-headshot, but they\u2019re very situational and pretty difficult to execute. Press E, cancel the dash with flash or galeforce, right click your target before the net lands, you\u2019ll go auto-headshot. You can also cancel the dash by putting your back to a thick wall, or by getting rooted or grounded during the cast time (before the dash starts).\n\nSuper advanced (\u201crainbow combo\u201d): If you flash during your E cast time, you\u2019ll throw net from wherever you flashed to (like Ahri flash charm). You can then use galeforce to cancel the dash into auto-headshot. Timing is super tight tho. E-flash-galeforce-rightclick. Super situational, tbh I wouldn\u2019t bother learning it.\n\nI think that\u2019s everything that works these days. Learn your spacing and positioning, put traps under CC/GA/Zhonya\u2019s/TP and stuff like yone\u2019s ghost, learn kiting and how to maximise your autoattack uptime while staying safe. All of that is a higher priority than any combos except for EQ/EW and maybe fast trap.",

I guess I should move in between to the same point where I want to place the trap, and then put the trap immediately, so I can aim the trap accurately?\n\nAlso thank you a lot for all the details options, gonna try them soon.",

Ofc, if you\u2019re putting the trap directly under an enemy, you have to click on the ground next to them.\n\nIf you move too early you\u2019ll cancel the auto, so you have to wait until the windup finishes (when the bullet leaves the gun), but the other four commands can all be done as fast as you can input them.\n\nIf you don\u2019t input the second auto, when you do it right you\u2019ll sometimes rotate and slide around weirdly because you start moving during your W cast animation.",

Don't worry about combos on Caitlyn for the time being. Her strength is her aa range. Learn to trade with her while not getting retaliated on. If you can get good at poking and staying on the edge of her range you'll do far more damage than any combo which can come at a later stage. Once you have this down move onto the next stuff.\n\nThis is just one man's opinion. In the end play the game however you want and most importantly, enjoy!",

Caitlyn is a lot less about combos and a lot more about positioning and laying traps effectively in combat. Learning to lay traps precisely where someone is walking, laying traps under your own feet when you're being dove, stealth traps hidden behind the tower etc. are all the difference between a good and a great Cait. The feeling of just absolutely finessing a trap right underneath someone who's chasing you is unmatched.\n\nAlso if you build Galeforce you can instantly cancel your E knockback with it for some fancy stuff.",

All u need to know is E flash interactions (E slow flash vs E fast flash) and E W vs E auto W and when to use which. \nCaitlyn is mostly positioning and wave management, at the moment her builds are not the greatest, best being Stormrazor into Galeforce into RFC which is getting nerfed next patch. Infinity Edge is just a very underwhelming item and Lethality options are not reliable for game to game bases. Next patch she will probably build Statikk into Collector into RFC with her mythic depending on the game. \n\nAnyways my biggest tip for Cait is do not focus on combos other than E W and ur positioning, trap placement and wave management",

You shouldn't play Caitlyn for flashy combos, instead focus on trading, positioning, and controlling the play area with traps, and learn the basics of playing ADC and Caitlyn in general. For example, her Q deals less damage to targets beyond the first, but if you snare an enemy with a trap, you'll deal max damage. Also, if there are bushes nearby, use it. Bushes makes your passive charge faster.",

I just buy the recommended items, I haven't bothered to read the descriptions because idk wtf \"true damage\" or any of that stuff means. Just ugh, how do I learn this game, it's like there's no place to start, do I just start reading item descriptions randomly and googling shit? it feels really fucking stupid and complicated. ugh.\n\nedit: and the beginning is always really fucking boring",

Some games will be a legit waste of time some will be close some your team will dominate. \n\nStick to your lane until turrets are down or until you\u2019re being pushed on too hard you can\u2019t hold the lane. Call for help if this is happening. Abandon the lane when everyone else is pushing middle. Or if you\u2019re fed push the lane to take down some turrets but be careful.\n\nAt some point your team will wanna take the dragon down, baron. Your team will wanna push middle to get the big minions up. \n\nDon\u2019t jump turrets to get kills pre level 6 you\u2019ll likely just die.\n\nDon\u2019t trade kill for kill with certain champions, don\u2019t trade kill for kill vs adc.\n\nIf you\u2019re jingling make sure to help your lanes when they need it. If your support don\u2019t steal your adcs gold.\n\nAll things you slowly learn by playing",

This game requires some practice and knowledge, you need to spend some time learning what you have to do, it's not of those games where you have a good performance by playing the way you want.",

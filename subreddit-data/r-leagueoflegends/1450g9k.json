Immediately picks up the champ and is quite literally a one trick.\n\nAny other champion he tries to play he fails miserably at, and his learning progression is severely slow. The most he knows how to do proficiently is press summoners.\n\nRecently he\u2019s been moving away from the cat to Ezreal but it\u2019s going about how you expect with him even wanting to just go back to her.\n\nYuumi cripples any new player that plays her, it warps perceptions of the game, how to play, and any meaningful skill expression. \n\nAlso with how they are nerfing her, and most likely again soon because of pro play, she not only promotes extremely bad habits, but is also terrible for solo queue. \n\nWish she never existed.",

But there is also another group of players --- people who would never play the game at all if yummi didn't exist. People who ONLY play yummi or two trick yummi sona or something.\n\nI hate yummi. I detest yummi and enchanter players. But from a business perspective, it was probably still correct to release yummi.",

I think yuumi actually allows new players to quarantine off parts of the game so they can learn at an easier pace. \n\nIt's not like new players will only play yuumi forever so I think players will want to play other champs when they feel comfortable and will have more fun when they do since they know how champions interact.",

Sure you can't position your own chamption as Yuumi, but you shouldn't police others on how they want to play or learn the game. I personally learned how to play League through arams when I started since it was a less stressful way for me to learn the game.",

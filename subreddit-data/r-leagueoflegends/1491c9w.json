    "postText": "Mersa (Support of TH) recently tweeted:\n\n[https://twitter.com/MersaLoL/status/1667965174416850944](https://twitter.com/MersaLoL/status/1667965174416850944)\n\nIt showed a video of the LVP where they played Shaco orianna combo where shaco just delivered packages to the enemy team for them to get oneshot.\n\nHe said the following:\n\n&gt; Just taking this clip as an example I never understood why weaker teams dont try similar stuff like this internationally. If the enemy team is a clear favourite you have nothing to lose. Stuff like ivern-rengar bot in the past or anything new that they never faced could help imo \n\nNow eventually he also said about the topic after someone asked why don't they play it in the LEC because they had \"nothing\" to lose:\n\n&gt; I dont think the gap is that big, especially bo1's everyone can win from times to times. Im talking about x NA team vs x LPL team for example at worlds\n\nNow I don't want to discuss which teams are bad, and should try these meta strategies or not. But I think the meta overall is way too much copying what other teams are doing and just  handshake and see who's best. whereas there is many ways to throw people off guard with other strats like the abovementioned Orianna shaco combo. \n\nIn the past we have seen things like laneswaps, LS short stint at C9, Reapered old weird drafts, G2 flexing pyke. but overall it has not been enough. \n\nIn my opinion this is partly due to the fact that the meta is always played on a delay. I know 3 days is a bit short for teams to practice, there is a PBE, and there is patch notes. I think if there are teams that are really good at adapting to the meta, they should be given that window. And lets be honest only 1 every 4 patches or so actually contains a significant change that could stir up the meta. Most often it's just filler content anyways. \n\nIf we look at the LEC who have been playing every phase of their bracket on the same patch. Which eventually means they will be behind 2-3 patches which honestly is more ridiculous. \n\nI think the overall opinion should also change on picking \"cheese\". It has a negative stigma where you apparently agree that you are worse than the opponent and thus have to try to catch the opponent off guard. However at the same time we all seemed to be fine with the way G2 played in 2019 spring finals where they played funnel vs Origen. I think cheese is a good way of playing the game, it's less consistent but if you are consistent at pulling it off over and over, isn't that just pure skill?\n\nTL;DR\n\nI think LOL pro scene needs to remove patch delay to allow for more prone meta read differences and that it should open more to cheese which does not show you are inferior to the enemy in any way at all.",

Which allows you to be the frontrunner.\n\nAnd if mersa thinks that especially in international tournaments these things can bring good succes then why arent these things practised domestically.

Good teams play the meta, because it offers the msot reliable wincons, and the fewer blind sides.\n\n&gt;Sometimes a cheese isnt Just a draft advantage its also a countermeta thats developing. \n\nPlaying Nautilus mid isn't a cheese, it's just a reactive/counter pick. Playing funneled Nocturne jungle to ult the enemy supprt when they're level 4 is a cheese, not a counter pick.\n\nA cheese really all come down to a draft advantage, and *maybe* a slight surprise in-game. Pro players tend to play hundreds of games every month, they've already seen everything you're gonna throw at them; so the biggest advantage you have is baiting the enemy team into a draft that's unfavourable, because they didn't expect you to go for said strategy.\n\n&gt;G2, MAD already qualified for playoffs so next split they technically can develop their own meta as there is nothing to lose.\r  \n\r\n\nThere's only so much time to prepare in a week. Either yo upractice your cheese, which has a chance of winning you or losing you a game, and is very unlikely to win you anything after the first 1-2 times you pull it out, or you train to become a better team that plays the meta more effectviely.\n\nAs I said, teams in major regions don't practice cheese because they need to practice meta to have an actual chance of performing, and they're not so far behind that they're playing for 1-2 upsets.",

As much as we want to deny it, G2 was sucessfull not because their 5 players were all better than their asian competition, but rather that good/some of the best EU players knew better how their opponents played than they how G2 played cause of their flexes etc. \n\nEven FNCs \"sucess\" in 2020  vs. TES in the first games came a lot with pocket picks from Bwipo and Hyli, if I'm not mistaken.   \n\n\nBut for this to work against asian teams more than one game/series, you need to be really good with your style. And thats the real difficulty, being good enough for doing this at regional level with out being figured out all year and still be among the best before even going to worlds/MSI.  \n\n\nTH never had the caliber of players in any role to do that or win in a \"honest way\". If anything Flakked and Vetheo are more capable for this than their previous players.",

Playing Caitlyn bot isn't a cheese strat, playing Xerath APC bot is.\n2. You say that West vs East hasn't performed well without cheese picks/specific strats, and that it's the big difference... but how common are LEC2 vs LEC8 upsets, without specific picks/strats? To me it's one and the same, and both underdogs are vastly outclassed by the favorite team.",

They had crazy strong 3v3 and 4v4 fights and insane side lane plays. DL said it best, other teams really had no fucking clue when to back because G2 would find a way to sneak an objective or get a pick.\n\nFNC success came to the fact that rekkless was the best senna and probably the best jhin in the world at that time, hyli was stronger yyj and selfmade was comfortable with the meta. At the end knight and 369 completely gapped bwipo and neme on standard picks and karsa had a crazy good game on nidalee, but fnatic bot was absolutely skill checking TES\u2019 for most of the time.\n\nI don\u2019t think that individually EU is that gapped (bar specific players), its just the Asian teams are on a different planet when it comes to executing meta comps.",

The community seems to also have embraced playing by the book to the point anything beyond standard drafting is considered trolling. \n\nThat being said, TH is one of the best teams to play unorthodox strategies. Flakked can play off-meta ADCs, Evi can play picks like Trynda or Urgot and Vetheo can play any of the two windbros. It has worked in the past, G2 made Pantheon work by adapting to his strong lvl3 and having Yike play for topside, Labrov playing Blitzcrank against Fnatic which just dictated the entirety of the game's pace, and we also have had players picking comfort like Comp's Sivir, or LIDER's Irelia, which became powerpicks down the line.",

Cheese comps are fun, but the reason they\u2019re cheese comps is because it\u2019s hard to pull off consistently, as you said. If you could pull off stuff like the shaco Orianna combo reliably and consistently, it would be meta, but people can\u2019t for a variety of reasons (communication and coordination, laning matchups, general usefulness of champions, etc). It wouldn\u2019t be cheese if it could be reliably replicated. \n\nChampions that are easy to pull off and reliably execute the same thing every game are going to be more prominent, Annie being the biggest example right now. That\u2019s part of what contributed to the enchanter meta, tank metas, and why Azir was so popular for so long. As for why there are picks that are seemingly consistent or reliable but not played, that has to do with players and coaching staff internal dialogue that none of us are privy to.",

Kanavi literally first timed Naut jungle at MSI. It's what I call Ryze syndrome. Whenever Ryze is meta every single mid in the world is spamming Ryze, they need to get 99% proficiency in all of Ryze matchups and gameplay so their soloq is 75% Ryze games and the other 25% is Ryze lane counters. Pros literally waste their time by playing their 20th Ryze game of the week to get 0.01% better at a matchup than play something they think *could* be strong i.e Fizz/Qiyana/Swain/Anivia/Malz/Xerath/Zilean etc... and when you ask them why they don't at least play the occasional game of these off meta champions the reponse is \"Faker/Chovy/Doinb/Showmaker etc.. don't play those champions so they suck\" meanwhile all it takes is a few games of Zilean to get 90% proficient for an Elite level mid laner who can then say \"Hey guys, instead of picking Ryze like everyone else is doing I've played a few games of Zilean this past week and think it's really strong I'm not 100% but trust me\".",

If from this point onwards patches ceased to exist, I imagine throughout the course of the next few years the meta will develop to the point at which it is hardly recognizable compared to today, despite playing the exact same game.\n\nBut because patches exist, if you find a strat that differs greatly from the gameplay that Riot wants to be played there's a good chance it will be heavily nerfed or removed altogether from the game. Its probably not the best use of time to invest heavily into strats that will likely not work in the future.",

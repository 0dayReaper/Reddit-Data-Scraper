I\u2019ve recently been helping a friend who played to level 30 and at this level, the game is way too demanding with all the stuff that\u2019s going on.\n\nZac has a skill shot in his Jump, he has his blob mechanics that players need to play around, his Q is a skill shot as well. He\u2019s a champ that is totally unforgiving when you go in, don\u2019t hit your Q and don\u2019t gather the blobs to stay alive and heal. Now combine that with 9 other champs that have abilities and need to be watched, combine that with all the Macro and micro shit. This is way too much. \n\nLike many people said, amumu is one of the best junglers for beginners, fairly strong in current meta and always useful due to his ult and cc even when behind. His jungle clear is also absolutely simple and realiably fast. Again, as soon as a mechanic is involved that is specific to a champ and is literally a core to the champs kit or if there\u2019s crucial skill shots that need to be hit, that is the point where a layer of complexity is added to the game which makes a champ absolutely non beginners friendly. \n\nBeginner friendly champs with a one dimensional gameplay (one dimensional is not always bad):\n\nTop: malphite, garen\nJungle: amumu, nunu\nMid: Annie, Lux \nAdc: ashe, sivir\nSupport: lux, nautilus, Leona",

You can do just junglers if you prefer that role, but I've been doing all roles (I'm at 135 champs!) \n\nI used to basically only play supports and mages, hated anything meelee. Then I figured out I really enjoyed and was surprised at how good I was with auto attack based junglers. Olaf and trundle are really fun for me.\n\nThat also helps you see what the weaknesses of each character is and allow you to abuse them at their weak spots.\n\nOf course playing meta helps, but metas shift. I think the best of idea is finding what you succeed at and not just because you guessed you were good at it but because you tried and saw it for yourself.",

There's a reason why Maokai after initially being buffed into pro-play spotlight has remained there even after he was nerfed into the ground... His kit is just that good!",

Lots of hard cc, easy clear, easy ganks, landing Q is pretty much the hardest part about playing him. \n\nZac is a good one too. High dmg tank with an easy kit.\n\nSejuani isn't too hard either. \n\nThese 3 are probably your best options for low ELO, Zac especially tends to catch people off guard very easily with his insanely long engage range, and tons of disruption. \n\nThe problem with tank jungles is your lack of damage means you rely on your damage dealing carries to do what they're supposed to. \n\nKayn is a good option for climbing, as he is incredibly easy to play and is VERY strong in low ELO. (Incredible healing, versatile itemization, walks thru friggin walls, untargetability, some hard cc and good damage) most low ELO players suck at playing around his healing and ult, and his ability to gank from any direction really shines in an ELO where people don't even have minimaps.",

There are too many recycled veterans, and the overall quality of play has been noticeably worse since the ban, reaching its lowest point this year.

I won't be surprised if importing volume returns to 2015 levels by next year or the year after.\n\nEdit: One LDL team (Miaojing) even has 3 Korean imports.",

Now he has Elk/Xun as his teammates which are great carry players. Bro can finally chill and let his team bring him victory.

People overreaction early on in the split are always so funny to me just like how people were on edge about jdg cause they were kinda sus in regular season spring split. Until blg beat jdg in a bo5, they will always be below jdg and currently they are 0-4 vs them so idk what these people are smoking.",

Look at how they play like the rift is just a play ground. ON being on other players face, Elk flashing/galeforcing/dashing towards an enemy team, Bin with his minimum kp, Xun and his 2 digit KDA on k6, and Yagao being the trollest Neeko ever. I would hate them too tbh.",

But this list is for current form not playoff+ form btw. \n\n&gt;Until BLG can beat JDG they will remain the second best team. Remember this is just the reg season\u2026 JDG dropped games and series in reg season but they still finished first. They even lost to WBG last split too..\n\nI mean this for current split and they had not yet face top wbg or JDG so it is not fair to say so yet. \n\n&gt;LNG are a great reg season team, it\u2019s just that they cannot replicate that during the playoffs.\n\nAgain current form. \n\n&gt;WBG is very coinflip and that isn\u2019t a team I want at worlds. \n\nOfff disgusting. Even if they are coinflipy you cannot deny they beat JDG and LNG which make it deserve they got the first place spot.\n\n&gt;EDG another team that does well reg season but haven\u2019t been able to do well in playoffs (this year). I\u2019m not convinced and I think they are pretenders.\n\nI mean they literally have problem of the team with leave even going to alt accounts to flame Jijie which kinda tells you all about the state of the team. Uzi can very well fix that because at least we know he is a normal person who is already a friend with 3 players on the roster. \n\n&gt;TES can be pretty good but I don\u2019t trust them\n\nTrue.",

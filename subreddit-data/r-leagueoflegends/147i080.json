    "postText": "Mage as a class is too open ended, AP as a stat is too nebulous because AP's purpose changes from champ to champ whereas AD, AS, Crit etc. are more well defined.\n\nI do think that the problem with AP itemization is that people expect items to be good on everyone in general so design should approach a more agressive way with items to have a core user base. They would really like the item and its a good option for them but a niche-non optimal item for most. \n\nLike Rylai or Lich Bane. They are used by a small amount of champions BUT it's a good item for it's users. Thats it and thats fine. AP itemisation could use more items like these.\n\nWe need to have general AP items that are for certain situations and then specific items for groups of champs.\n\nHaving these overtuned general items like dcap, void staff, etc is how we get to the dull itemization we have right now which affects even AP Assassins.",

AP assassins and bruisers are the reason why the itemization is fucked. Dcap is overtuned because if we took its power budget and split it on other items, then ap bruisers and assassins become too strong.\n\nMages are mana reliant and squishy, they need items to fix their kit before they can move on to stronger items. Akali, Fizz and Katarina can build with 0 haste and 0 mana, they straight up go immediately to ap, mpen and health. On top of that, they have huge base damage as assassins to help them carry out that gameplan.\n\nWhat's keeping them in check is that AP itemization is backloaded towards rabadon+void, and that's a huge commitment.\n\nFor AP bruisers, it's different, they are made to function really well on low AP, and they are not allowed to use rabadon. Splitting its strength in other items would require many nerfs, that would probably make them even more item-reliant than they already are.\n\nIf you're looking for a culprit, look at Mejai. That thing is too strong in the right hands across the AP roster, and it's hard to balance.\n\nYou want to fix the itemization ? Allow mages to pick an alternative to Rabadon that maximizes AH and counters tenacity, then you can nerf it.",

Both Void and Rabadon are just mehh design, not exactly for what they do but what tehy don't. granted my woording was poor but what i meant to tell is that these items are blatant, one dimensional. If you ask a 10years old to create something he/she would create some op shit BUT if you would tone it down you would get a better item which also more creative than having 2 items (1 AP boost and 1 MP boost). Look at Serylda. It combines Rylai and Shadowflame (arguably because AD assassins needs strong effects for having access to relative weaker stats, but you get the point.)\n\nMejai is a difficult question. Design wise the item is simple and universal for every AP user so it incentivises a creative, snowball heavy game on some champions but you also loose big value if you die like 2 times in a row or so. But if you have a lead it's a win more item until you need to sell it (if you are full build but you need deffensive item you need to sell mejai every now and then-based on champ).",

Protobelt for mobility, zhonyas and banshee for good deff, crown for even better deff, everfrost for cc, rylais for slows etc.. What else do u guys need to not suck?\n\nThe only thing I would ask for is better or more MR pen items or % dmg (liandrys dmg kinda too slow to deal with a tank chasing u) cuz I can't deal with tanks but that's also not my job as a mage.. If u pick a burst mage into 3 tanks it's your fault.",

Both items are build by all mage subclasses because there are no other alternatives to these items. ADs have like idk 4 items as percentage based armor pen with everyone of them changing your playsytyle. \nYour argumentation with ap items exist for certain champs isn't refected by reality where 96% of the mage class build the same 10 items.",

I believe Burst Mage is the only one who have a well defined built. Luden Sorc Shadowflame core (or Horizon). \n\nActually I believe Rylai, Shadowflame, Seraph, Horizon, Cosmic are somewhat well balanced now that ppl finally have options (not saying they could not have been better tho, or have better access) and the biggest issue lies in the rabadon-void area.",

It was even good BEFORE the morgana jungle buffs, so I think the buffs came out a little bit out of \"nowhere\" the ONLY thign I feel with Morgana jungle is that you don't have a \"set in stone rune\" that is just...insanely good (think PTA lucian, conq darius etc) and you don't have THAT much hard carry potential in the fact that your damage isn't like assassin, where you can just delete someone immediately, it's more backloaded in that the Q hit is huge burst, then W wittles them down and at the end of R is the one that usually kills. \n\nI feel like she is kind of a more all-inney Zyra jungle, in the fact that Zyra jungle can peel and stay back, and wait for them to make mistakes, as Morgana you kinda got to go in if you want to \"hard carry\" or else you just become a support with some damage and just peel for your carries with E and Q and zone with R.",

It's not like she was farming against Zed in lane where Zed could, if ahead, deny her from exp and gold (although, admitedly, laning with that Senna most likely was worse). Also, with him being in the support role that means champs like K6 and Zed have 3 targets to focus on: the midlaner (an LB), the ADC (which, yes, sucks but common soloQ players will still focus them no matter their actual damage) and lastly him as Lux support. 3 targets they need to be blowing up, and one of them can possibly burst them just as hard and maybe even quickly.\n\nThis isn't to undermine his play, he played to his strenght (range and catch potential) and reacted well in catching out people off guard and peeling, but the enemies had enough targets to open up disorganization in their coordination and him as Lux can reduce part of the enemy's burst with shield for survivality (assuming they get on him instead of attacking his allies that, again, may seem more important or simply are in better range to be engaged upon).",

At one point, about 15 minutes, I\u2019m 4-1, 30 CS up on on the kayn (who is 1-1).

I\u2019m like, I\u2019m trying to carry. I have a big lead. They just int because they refuse to give up a turret that will die to one herald charge and then blame me for it. Just over that crap.",

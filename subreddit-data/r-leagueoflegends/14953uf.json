    "postText": "GAME 2 not 1: Invictus Gaming ties it up 1-1 against Edward Gaming. Ale giveth and Ale taketh, had many solokills but gave it all away. The legendary Uzi is back and looks great in team fights and in lane. Crying did a great job of stunning multiple targets. This is Uzi's second game on Aphelios and good in team fights but hard to win with Ale running it down after laning phase. He started 6-1 and just kept getting caught or dying in team fights and ended 7-8. Props to Wen's GP in his debut where although he got beaten in lane he was able to help significantly in team fights. Game 3: Who will win?",

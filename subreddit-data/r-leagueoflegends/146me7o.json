Do i go back to silver 1 0lp or silver 4 0 lp?\n\nThanks.",

There's a limited number of challenger slots (like 100 per region), so you play and get awarded points per win. Every hour the 100 players with the highest points get moved into challenger. All the others are moved into Grand Master. If you stop playing ranked for two weeks then you start losing points and get demoted until you hit diamond.",

You go to kill a ward and suddenly the ward is attacking you. By end game you are ignoring the minions in the middle of a fight but wtf why is that caster doing so much damage to me? She changes the game to an extent that you never have to think about when she isn't in game so it simply won't ever be learned like say, pink ward for Eve cause there are plenty of other champs with stealth but nothing else does what Neeko does.",

This isn\u2019t a normal situation. The team has inhibitors and nexus turrets down, this means you MUST be focused on the map. Everything HAS to look good in your base. Might be the time people buy scanners so that you can lower the likelihood that someone has a ward in your base to TP to. If they have champions that have long stealths, I don\u2019t just afk my brain and let them walk in. If you don\u2019t see neeko in the fight, it\u2019s reasonable to expect shenanigans somewhere.\n\nAlso, kinda unreal, if you\u2019re playing a game with neeko and start ignoring minions, I think you kinda deserve to lose the game",

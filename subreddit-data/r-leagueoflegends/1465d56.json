    "postText": "Disclaimer: I am not talking about 1 month or a 1-2 years, but people like me who played 1 month - 2 years at the start of the game and came back to it. \n\nI watched a beginners guide. The guide person said pick different champs and jump into normal mode. This I did. Normal mode (blind smth) and picked veigar. My teammates got pretty angry with me, because apparently you type the roles in chat and the fastest gets the role (?). I was also confused about Runes and what spells to use. Picked a lane tried my best to not die and kill some minions. Teammates got really mad. So I muted all of them. We lost, but then again the entire game felt pretty disorganized and ppl just did what they wanted.\n\nOkay, after that I read up on all of the stuff, but shouldnt this entire knowdlege at least be somewhere in the game? Yes, it should be the players responsibility to inform themselves, but I dont think a lot of them will do. Why not do some tutorials like\n\n\\-&gt; here are you runes\n\n\\-&gt; here are you roles\n\n\\-&gt; this is how jungle\n\n\\-&gt; wards are now \"autmatic\"\n\n\\-&gt;in blind pick (other game modes) you say your role at the starts\n\n\\-&gt;this is how you get new champions now\n\n\\&gt;these champions are good for beginners in the role\n\n\\&gt;a game mode that allows you to pick your role/champs BEFORE the game (like you pick a class in Hearthstone)\n\n  \nWhat do you think?   \n",

An evolving tutorial would be required. \nFro your first point well runes are automatic by now so not much more they can do, you have to read them. \nThey tell you roles exist and there isn\u2019t much more that can be done without taking a deep dive, they already give you the option to sort for champions by lane. \nGiven that jungle can be the most complex of them all they really can\u2019t do more than showing you where to go on the first clear otherwise it would invalidate know how. \nAnd what do you mean by wards are automatic?",

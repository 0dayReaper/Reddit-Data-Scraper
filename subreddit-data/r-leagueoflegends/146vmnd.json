Once something is GA\u2019d, no team is allowed to use said GA\u2019d gun/attachment/lethal/etc.\n\nI know that league has a different system, but what if they GA\u2019d things like Zeri or Yuumi? Seems frustrating that teams have to waste bans on champs like these, who have seen pro play relevancy for quite some time. Not saying this is an easy fix or something\u2014just sort of thinking out loud and wanted to start a discussion.",

If anything it would be more intelligent to complain to riot since they would listen and change it rather than to have this manlet agreement that would require all of the 300ish players who could be attending worlds to accept it, after all you don't want to arrive at worlds and face a team who plays zeri yuumi while you didn't play it for the sake of a GA.",

What it does is severely limit the amount of variance that can be seen in a match where metas are already somewhat stale . It's really boring and disconnects players from pros even more. You should wondering why Riot is doing nothing about a goo brain, alleged noob champ being top tier at pro level.",

Its just another gun, with one that is better being banned away. If you banned Zeri Lulu you would make other picks possible that then cant be answered properly, because the champs you need to answer them are banned.   \n\n\nIm not really deep in the pro meta currently but lets say Draven Leona is hard countered by Zeri Lulu. If you then ban Zeri Lulu Draven Leona becomes infinitely better because a possible countermatchup is banned away. It might even become OP enough that this lane would have to be banned aswell and then you start going in circles",

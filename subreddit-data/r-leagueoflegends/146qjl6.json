    "postText": "Whenever I do basic actions the game takes control of the camera.\n\nWhen I use hexportal - the camera gets fucked.\n\nWhen I get ulted by many champions such as Tahm Kench, Poppy, Urgot, Jhin - the camera gets fucked.\n\nWhen I use catapult on URF - the camera gets fucked.\n\nThere are probably more actions that I forgot to mention.\n\nThis is highly disruptive to the gameplay. Especially on ARAM. Imagine watching a teamfight then you have to move camera back to base and click hexportal then click somewhere else again. You lose at least few seconds of teamfight action and you might miss certain key elements such as enemy champions using ults/summoner spells etc.\n\nIs there a setting that I can toggle or a way to stop game from taking control of camera?",

Unfortunately, there is no way to stop them from moving your camera (that I know of) so the next best thing to do is just click on map or spacebar. \n\nRiot should definitely add an option to settings that simply stops uncontrolled camera movement.",

People have played like 7 or 8 seasons in the minors and still get called up. And people will get called up and then have a rough time and be sent down for more seasons. This is what developing talent is over a longer period of time. Clearly, orgs see value in the players they hold onto for multiple seasons in academy. Even if the goal was simply to have a decent emergency sub, those people have to play somewhere. Nobody is not getting a shot because of Ryoma. If the org wanted someone other than him, they would have chosen them over him. And they didn't.",

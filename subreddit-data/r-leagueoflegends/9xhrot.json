                                    "comment": "&gt;~~Viktor~~ Vayne is so lucky it just came off of cooldown as he passed the wall.\n\nIt's a 1 item Vayne with with 260 health and 3 full levels behind the Viktor. The stun would look cool, and then the Vayne would just die anyways, and probably blow heal too. I don't even think the Viktor would need to hit anything but a Q+AA, but let's check.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n * From OP.GG the Viktor was level 13 with Q maxed and had a sheen.   \n * From OP's video of the Viktor's POV we can see Viktor has **223 AP** on the first part of his Q, and **232 AP** when he has the movement speed from it (celerity). The Viktor also has **92 AD**.    \n * From the video OP posted we can see the first part of Viktor's Q alone doing **201 damage** to Vayne.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nFrom this we can tell quite a bit... Viktor's Q would have done 229.2 damage to a 0 MR target (140+0.4AP). Vayne's MR reduced the damage to 201. It did ~87.7% of the damage that it would have if there was no MR involved.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nFollowing that same logic the second part of his Q deals significantly more damage, 120+1.0AD+0.55AP+1.0AD(Sheen). This would be a total of 120+92+127.6+92 = **~431.6 damage** for the second part of the Q. Assuming Viktor Q converts the full auto attack to magic damage like Nidalee's does (not sure if this is the case) then it's 431.6 pre-mitigation magic damage, reduced at the same rate as before would give us **~378 damage**  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nSo a Viktor Q+AA should deal around **579 damage** to the vayne. \n&amp;nbsp;  \nVayne had 279 health as her E was about to come off of cooldown. Another 225 effective health from heal, for a total of 504 HP. So Viktor's Q+AA overkills the Vayne by 75 damage. Vayne would need to heal at least 75 health during the stun (1.5 seconds).  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nVayne has 12% lifesteal, so she'd need to auto-attack for 625 damage to out lifesteal the Q+AA. But Vayne also has ravenous hunter, so the condemn would have healed for a bit too. Between the BOTRK, Ravenous Hunter, and passive health regen, the Vayne might actually just barely survive a Q+AA. If she dodges the E and Comet it could be close, but with only a BOTRK she still probably doesn't kill the Viktor before his Q is back up again, or he autos 1 more time. ",

Once the player uses their ability, they have a 10 second window where they can use it a second time for free. After that 10 second window, you have to wait about a minute to use it at all.\n\nKha'Zix also has a special system of upgrades. Every 6 levels, the player can pick 1 of their 4 abilities and make it stronger. For Void Assault, you get another free activation in your 10 second window.\n\nSo the player in this video just happened to choose Void Assault as one of their upgrades. They ran into this tall grass (no one can see you in tall grass unless they walk inside it). Then an opponent checked inside the tall grass, and the player timed their invisibility juuuuuust right so it looked like the place was empty.\n\nThe opponent then checked two more times because they were confident Kha'Zix was in the tall grass, but the player used their 2 free Void Assault casts to avoid getting caught. At that point, the opponent decided that Kha'Zix must have run somewhere else and went away.\n\nIf the player hadn't chosen to upgrade Void Assault, if their opponent was a little more patient, or if they messed up any of the timings, Kha'Zix would definitely have died. You can see that they almost messed up when they activate Void Assault a second time.",

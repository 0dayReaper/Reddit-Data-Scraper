We pretty much know armao isn't going to stack up, and sheiden, I'd be surprised. Role to role, they stack up either lower middle or bottom tier with only Jojo and unforgiven being possible carries. \n\nUnfortunately I'd guess Jojo gets burned out VERY early if this team loses in the first couple weeks. If they start winning early, they'll be a momentum dark horse.",

With a rookie you have a much, much higher chance of that.\n\nI swear it's only NA that seems to have this weird mindset.

He also has had a tough time with very mediocre to bad rosters on IMT. Guilhoto considered him to be a diamond in the rough just last year, saying in time he can grow and improve. Perhaps a new roster will really unlock him.",

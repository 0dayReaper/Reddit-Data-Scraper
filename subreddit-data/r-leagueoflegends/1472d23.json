It can even be someone that isnt usually a mid laner I just want it to work in mid lane.  \n\n\nI refuse to play vlad though that champ feels horrible to play",

He's useless in early skirmishes too, so it's pretty likely the opposing laners gets mega fed by roaming to river fights and invading with their jungler. Leblanc doesn't scale *quite* as hard, but she can actually win lanes and contribute something to 2v2 skirmishes, and her level 11 and 16 power spikes are still enormous.",

The ranged carries i named have more consistent dmg and probably less burst. Dare i say it... And then vlad does his combo to nuke all",

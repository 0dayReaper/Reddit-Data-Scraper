I would rather play Vayne or Kalista if I want to hop in and out of the fight.\n\nI just do not get why she HAS to always be viable, regardless of patch. Pro meta is getting super stale because of her",

She is basically like another Ryze but to an even bigger level since he offers so much utility with his ultimate while Zeri is just pure ADC.",

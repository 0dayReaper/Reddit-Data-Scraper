I would like to suggest a change on deathcap build path.\nHaving 2 large rods makes the itemization feels bad.\n\nSomething like:\n\nLarge Rod + Blasting Wand + Amplifying Tome\n\nWould make the transition a lot more smooth and satisfying than going back to base not being able to buy anything because the components are so expensive.",

            "comment": "Neeko is horribly overtuned.\n\nEven without taking the concept of disguising as a minion into consideration, her kit powercreeps those of Lux and Morgana.\n\nHer snare is faster and travels through minions. Her AoE does more damage than Lux's E and Morgana's pool and has stronger synergy with her snare. She has an empowered auto attack that's easier to get off and has stronger lane presence. Her ultimate, a large AoE close range ultimate literally does Morgana's ultimate faster and better and can be comboed with protobelt.\n\nObviously she lacks the defense of a shield or spell shield, but her offensive capabilities are too damn strong and easy to use. And all that is compounded by her ability to disguise and the ease of taking players by surprise.\n\nIt's easy to dodge a Lux/Morgana snare UNLESS they take you by surprise. Neeko snare is faster and she surprises you a lot more often.\n\nProper Neeko nerfs: the projectile speed of her snare and AoE should not be faster than Lux/Morgana. It is unreasonable to expect players to anticipate a disguised Neeko especially in a stacked minion wave, and even when you do properly count the minions you don't know which one is Neeko. There should be a 0.5 or 1 second cast time before Neeko can break disguise and cast an ability to give players a chance to read and react.",

She hits as much as a pantheon emp w + q early game with a single ability.\n\nClones copying the snare is also hard to counter imo.",

But they are using the argument that the pros outweigh the cons. If their logic is that the possible upside of being able to strategize is worth the flame, then we would of had Voice Chat in SoloQ a decade ago. It seems to me they don't actually care about toxicity at all.\n\nPeople use Team Chat for flaming more than strategizing anyway because using text for it is extremely archaic and hard to used in a real time team-based competitive strategy game with minimal downtime and the constant stream of new information. \nWe've needed more communication options for SoloQ for years, especially to try to close the gap between SoloQ and competitive. It would probably help out champs who's WR's suffer because of lack of better communication tools. \n\nBut that this point, just nuke team chat and wash your hands of it Riot. Flat out admit you want SoloQ to not be a team game and continue to ruin balance by trying to cater to to many audiences at once. Divide the gap further and not make it easier for yourself.",

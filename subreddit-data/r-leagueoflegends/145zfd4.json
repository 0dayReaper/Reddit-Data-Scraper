The time is finally here: today, we are proud to present you all of the details about CBLOL English, our English broadcast, starting this Saturday, the 10\u1d57\u02b0 of June, with the opening of our second split.\n\nWe will be live on our newest Twitch channel ([right here for you to follow](https://www.twitch.tv/cblolenglish)) every weekend until September. Eight casters from four different countries (and of course all passionate about CBLOL) will bring all the thrill of our competition to a new language. They are:\n\n* Benton \u201cAxeman87\u201d Paterson  \n* Rafael \u201cDiA\u201d Ruizh  \n* Henrique \u201cFourY4\u201d DaMour  \n* Ben \u201cHawk\u201d Hawkins  \n* Ruski \u201cRoodood\u201d Hamidouche  \n* Ryan \u201cRMC\u201d Teo  \n* CJ \u201cTrajan\u201d Macdonald  \n* JC \u201cY4SO\u201d McDonough  \n\n[See them here!](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltad9188aa9a70543a/blt7af271de87b43402/64836bf574d5011196014192/CBLOL_ENGLISH_-_CASTERS.jpg)\n\nThe project is part of a series of strategies to take the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends, our pride, to other regions. After watching the work of this group, who have followed our competitive scene for quite some time and understand the essence of CBLOL, we decided to collaborate with them to bring CBLOL English to the international public!\n\n\"Like we announced at the start of the year, we are taking another step in the project to globalise CBLOL. This initiative responds to a growing interest we've observed from the international public. We believe that the time is right for CBLOL to be shared with this audience and to win it over, showing how we game and entertain in Brazil,\" affirmed Carlos Antunes, the Esports Lead at Riot Games Brazil.\n\nBe it in portuguese or in English, watch CBLOL live, from the 10\u1d57\u02b0 of June to the 9\u1d57\u02b0 of September and divirta-se (or have fun) with the most DIFF League of Legends championship on the planet.\n\n---\n\nAlso see [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/145i1sy).\n\nFrom what I understand, they contacted a fan production that had been casting CBLoL in English unofficially for a long time, and brought them on board! How cool is that? A note about this Diff stuff \u2013 #CBLOLDiff is the hashtag/slogan that CBLoL have been marketing themselves under for 2023, because it is built different. Essentially the idea is just to highlight the uniqueness of our entertainment.\n\nSo a little bit of my personal thoughts here: I am the child of Brazilian immigrants and I started watching CBLoL just as a way to improve my portuguese \u2013 the casters use more slang and speak quickly. From my parents, who knew nothing about Esports, they both agreed that the Brazilian casting sounded *exactly like* Brazilian football casting \u2013 it really gave me faith that the Brazilian spirit was there! My non-portuguese-speaking friends did not understand the broadcast, but enjoyed the energy nonetheless.\n\nThis is really valuable to me as a way to be able to share CBLoL, which I love, with my friends who would not understand it otherwise. I'm tired of having nobody to talk to about these games!\n\nThe Brazilian scene is full of characters, ridiculously fun bits ([like this one from when Yuumi was nerfed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc0ZqAHCSsM)), and passion from absolutely everyone involved. It might also be worth a watch for Brazilians trying to improve their English, as I know many may be trying to do \u2013 I see you out there with your 'relou's and 'gudebai's. I'm just an enthusiastic fan but I really do hope people check it out!",

Hopefully the CBLoL continues down the right track in developing their ecosystem to be success  for the long term future.",

I am, of course, still with Los, despite the loss of an incredible Pyke one-trick . . .",

    "postText": "After having been turned from a mythic to a legendary, it feels like nobody buys this item anymore. I don't think I've seen anyone this whole year in my games building this item. Even being the counterpart to sunfire cape, the cape still sees frequent use amongst many tanks.\n\nBefore the changes made to many adc items, stormrazor had a similar experience, being too niche with the passive and stats it provided.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that there is already an item (Dead man's plate) which kind of does the same with its passive, even if it does not give the same amount of move speed. And the whole mov speed concept feels too overused (youmuu's ghostblade and even the keystone Predator has a similar move speed buff).\n\nWould it be possible to change the passive a bit to make it more compelling and interresting to buy, like what stormrazor recieved?\n\nMaybe something like this: For the next X seconds, gain (scaling with level % atk speed) and your basic attacks deal bonus magic damage damage (scaling with bonus hp). (Optional) Increase the duration of this passive by 0.4 (or something similar) seconds with each basic attack, for a total up to X + Y seconds (Kind of like Rammus W).\n\nThis passive is a bit inspired from Arcane and how the item buffed up the bruisers fighting Vi and Jayce.\n\nWhat do you think?",

I want to see everyone with their own thing, going a build that's speficic to this game and this game only.\n\nI wanna have 300+ buildable items, so that my head literally explodes the moment I open the shop and try to think what to build next.\n\nI want items that change your summons, that give you an ability reset when you activate it/kill someone with it activated. Items that let you tp to towers (but not minions). Items that let you fortify towers/minions.\n\nI want to see people making weird builds that somehow counter the entire enemy team. I mean, you've invested 40 min of your time yo make a builf that does that right? Maybe you don't do dmg anymore, but now you don't take any either. \n\nO look, samira got an item that makes her melee, but now she has 100+ dmg and +15 lifesteal from just one item. Or now Jax is ranged but gets -50mr and -50 armour. I want to see negative stats too, give me something cool at the cost of stats like Guinsso's does.\n\nI want to see people complaining they can't kill teemo becouse now he just shrooms all of the map in 3seconds with 200%CDR at min 50.\n\nI want builds that make you a powerhouse if you want to, or unkillable if you want to, or a glass cannon that oneshots towers.\n\nI want to see people flaming in chat becouse the enemy bought the one item that counters their strat for the game and now their build is useless.\n\nI want to see build mindgames. \n\nPeople this days just ignore other player's builds, becouse the optimal is always the same more or less, maybe 1-2 items change in your build if you had the luck to pick a champ that has different builds. It gets boring pretty fast to try new builds or play your main becouse you never leave those 5-8 items that you are already tired of seeing.\n\nIt will also teach people to build right, couse people right now just look op.gg or go with what porofessor or league's shop tells them without thinking what they are buying really. Like it's not bad, but maybe you should know by yourself what's best to build and when? Otherwise you are just following a trend that some korean guy started and plays in niche matchups to get their opponent by surprise... like staticks's veigar (which isn't bad, it's just weird that veigar gets to use statick's while who would need that aoe/autoproc much more like shyv or ori can barely fit it in their builds couse it's just not cost effective for them).\n\nIdk... maybe i'm just weird.",

I want wolves to go and push my lane for me. I want my tower to be a Malphite with a laser. I want my creeps to have a commander that boosts their AS and resistances while there are no enemy champions nearby so I can choose to push a lane without being there, becouse I invested money into an item that does that.\n\nWhy doesn't hextech Drake connect botlane and toplane?\n\nWhy do we have no antivision AP items? How am I supposed to clear wards as Sona!?!!! \n\nWhy can't you use herald's eye to improve and allied tower instead of crushing it into an enemy one?\n\nSummoners rift games devolved into being much more fast paced, displacing scaling champs and making split pushing a bad strategy becouse the very first 20 min of the game there's gonna be like 5 teamfights where if you are 4vs5 you probably lose the game due to snowball.\n\nI want league to be more interactive, I don't care if it's more chaotic, I don't care if it's weird, I want to have weird strats available no matter the champion I play. If I lose becouse I decided to go a weird strat, that's on me.\nBut if I lose becouse I picked a champ that only has 1 viable build and it happens to not be good vs my enemies nor synergizes with my team, then I've practically left my team in a 4vs5 for the whole game. This is a niche situation, yes, but if I am a mage assasin, I should have to be able to have a build available that's good vs an enemy team that consist of 1 adc, 1 control mage and 3 tanks. Becouse if I can't I can only target 2 champs in their team, which happen to be the ones they peel for, so I'll be useless unless I can sucessfully engage, which with 3 tanks... it's not happening unless I get a play or they fuck up.\n\nI should be able to sacrifice burst for anti-tank dmg. Zed can, why can't nidalee? Becouse there are no such items for her unless you build ad. You can't build something for nida that makes dmg to tanks. \"But nidalee isn't supposed to kill tanks\" Yes, she's not, but if my max range Q does 250 dmg to them full build, when they have 5K hp how am I suppossed to fight them? To make them disengage with poke? I can't and that's it. They go in, CC me and I'm dead. Unless I run away from them and reliably dodge everything while microing Q's between pounces thru walls I can't even get close to killing them, even if they were to 1 vs 1 me. \n\nIdk, It just seems like you either pick a champion that has few counters, or pick last so they don't counter you. Becouse if they counter you, you are in for a boring game.",

Visage outcompetes it for anyone with healing/shielding in their kit or on their team. Abyssal is better for any ap tanks or any tank playing with a team that does magic damage. Four different MR items and 2 of them(stoneplate and FoN) are just better in straight up tanking. The other two are more situational, sure, but those are some decently common situations, and the only reason you'd have them competing with Chemtank is if you were building full MR because if you're only building 1 or 2 these four are just competing among themselves.

It works, but the situations where it's the best item for the situation based on both the active and the stats is very rare. It needs to be a game where you need the move speed to engage and want MR more than armor, but also don't need to maximize MR. Maybe if it gave armor and MR it would be more versatile, but most engage tanks that rely heavily on move speed to engage aren't that great right now anyway so idk.",

Also, a movement speed burst that decreases, which would let a diver tank stuns and slows to reach their target.\n\nFor the stats, keep it MR and Armor only with CDR. No HP, but the high resistances make sustain that much stronger. CDR to let the champs sustain thru their kit. \n\nThis would be a key item for a Bruiser, basically the item they build when they know they're strong enough to kill one or two and just need the ability to keep up a target and stay alive to finish the job. Bruisers, Divers, and Zaun Melee champs need more love item-wise.\n\nFor Tanks, it's a luxury item that lets them be even tankier, but it only really helps if they're dominating.",

    "postText": "So I just came back to this game after exactly one year (my last played game was on June 3rd of 2022) and I am essentially relearning the game as I only played for 2 months when I initially picked up league.\n\nI have been trying to find a main so I can learn the game and get better, but I have to find what role I want to play first. I usually suck at doing this though, picking one of anything is always difficult for me because I am extremely indecisive and I usually can't pick just one in games like this.\n\nI just can't really decide which role I want to choose, I used to play jungle but I want to try other roles, mainly mid top and support because they sound the coolest to me. I feel like I wouldn't like ADC just because I hate being squishy and I suck at positioning, also I dislike ranged champs for the most part.\n\nTop is cool because I like being really strong and powerful, I also like the solo aspect. Mid is intriguing because I still get to do damage and stuff but I get to do support things like roaming and helping my other teammates also. Support is for the same reasons as mid but I get to do more of the healing and caring for my team part of it.\n\nI don't know what I want to play/try out, I don't really have a ton of currency so I kind of want to know what character I should try and get first to see if I like that role or not.\n\nAll comments are appreciated :)",

            "comment": "My advice is find a champ you think is interesting and try them instead of focusing on a specific role. Once you find out what types of champions you like to play you can usually find one or two of those in each role and then figure out which role you prefer the most. \n\nI know that I like to play a more supportive role, but I don't like enchanters as much. This led to me to try engage champs and I didn't quite like that either, so I realized I liked more hybrid champs. I started playing Rakan, Malzahar, Taric, Braum, and even some champs like Ornn and Amumu. I also hated csing in lane, so I finally realized that I liked to play support the most and jungle second. \n\nHopefully this somewhat helps!",

            "comment": "I\u2019d suggest either mid or support. Top is really really *really* punishing if you fall behind or \u201cget gapped\u201d. The game becomes unplayable insanely fast. \n\nMid is similar, but given that you\u2019re in the center of the map, it\u2019s WAY easier to still have an effect on the game.\n\nI prefer support. I play a lot of thresh and nautilus. Even if I\u2019m 0-15, I can still have a huge impact on fights. I\u2019m always useful. The lane is also a 2v2 so it\u2019s less punishing for a single person to make a mistake since the other can potentially pick up the slack. Also playing well with a good adc is imo one of the most rewarding things in league. Feels amazing to clutch up a close fight.",

I'd play the hardest champ in the game if it mean't I loved playing them. \n\nWhen I play jungle I pretty much play kindred, and she's one of the harder junglers supposedly. When I came back after my break I realized that when I played my first match as jungler and picked her lol. I got destroyed.",

I like playing brand, xerath, and nasus primarily. These guys can cover every role except adc, which isn't worth playing in the first place. I might not always win but if I'm going down its with 70k damage and a lot of laughs along the way.",

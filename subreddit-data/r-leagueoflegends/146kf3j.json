Not based off the kiting that's actually doable when having a good day but the fact that he shoots his Q perfectly in a completely different direction while kiting which would require him to move his mouse at Mach 5 to the target and pixel perfect back to continue kiting in the same direction.",

Could be a funky setup like move on Z and attack on X and spamming it but that that rate, you are bound to cancle at least on auto in that entire play and he does appear to have almost perfect timing on every single auto.",

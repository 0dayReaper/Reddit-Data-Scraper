    "postText": "Ever since the rework this champ has been unbelievable unbalanced, if you don\u2019t each minion every time you go to lane or remember every single ward your team places you might end up just getting 1 shot by a Neeko. The pick rate compared to win rate ratio is wild in all roles and the champ just seems to be broken on purpose. With 13.12 coming up and no Neeko changes listed my hopes are dwindling that we will have a bearable meta soon. On top of Neeko, CC is becoming more and more of an issue as tenacity keeps getting nerfed and more and more ability haste items allow for champs like lux and Neeko to get cc up ever 3 seconds. I haven\u2019t had this little fun playing since the kassadin 95% win rate. Keep in mind my tales are from the point of view of a plat 1 so im not an expert on what it\u2019s like in high elo. Let me know your thoughts.",

Unless you're a melee champ, you should be able to farm further away where you should notice abnormal minion behavior if she's trying to angle.\n\nAs for the scuttle, wards save lives. Keep your zones lit up, and you should be able to notice when the Scuttle is taken and or mysteriously there again. Also keep tabs on the timers to know when you should not be seeing a Scuttle.\n\nAnd hell no, damage does not need to break her disguise. That's what made it completely worthless in the first version. The passive would be actually useless if things like a ping from Luden's or a stray auto cracked her disguise.",

Neeko is similar based on your point about tracking minions and wards. No other champion makes you meticulously track minions and wards when they are off the map. It\u2019s not her overall kit that\u2019s the issue, it\u2019s her ability to disguise herself as mundane objects.",

I do not find the concept to be game breaking, but is one that definitely needs much better balancing. Something as simple as a half-second to a second cast time to break disguise gives players a chance to identify and react. While players can be asked to count the number of minions in a wave, it honestly is too unreasonable to ask them to count minions on a stacked minion wave AND identify the Neeko, so at least give players a chance to see and react before Neeko's combos pop up. \n\nOverall, her offensive spells straight up powercreep the likes of Lux and Morgana already, but are made even stronger with the way too easy ability to surprise enemies with a disguise.\n\nThe projectile speed of her abilities seriously needs to be reduced to match that of Lux and Morgana and/or there needs to be a cast time to let players identify and react to a Neeko breaking disguise.",

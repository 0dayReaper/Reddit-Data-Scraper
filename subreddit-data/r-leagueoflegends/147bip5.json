I'm also tired of games where an enemy quits but the rest of them are gods so it takes a boring 30 minutes to end the game.",

I've been playing for 9 years and I achieve gold every year. \n\nThe difference in game knowledge between myself and the people on my team or I'm against is astonishing. I see nothing wrong with putting the new players in iron. It may even allow then to learn at their own pace instead of getting flamed and put off the game completely. Silver/gold is more competitive than people who only spend 20 games a season in it realise.",

Riot wants to make money so they are going to want to release skins that people would buy so they need a big playerbase for that champ, commonly the most popular champions have the most skins when the least well have the least.",

Yasuo, Ahri, Lux, Akali, Ezreal, Vayne, Morgana, Zyra, Zed, Leona, Lucian, Jinx, Fizz, Ekko, Caitlyn, and Master Yi are some of the more played characters in t he game, and they have prestige skins (a lot of them have more than one, excluding the 2022 variants). There are some like Seraphine, Senna, Qiyana, and Kai'Sa who got them very early after their release, but that was because they proved to be pretty popular at that time. K'Sante is a bit of a special case, since his skin coincided with World's and was designed by Lil Nas X, who was deeply involved in that World's.",

In the early seasons, buying $2 accounts wasn't a thing like it was today and it was much less common to have alt accounts in general. Especially the culture of buying a new $2 account if you \"ruin\" your winrate wasn't very common in the past but it is now. \n\nIt also took way longer to hand-level to 30 and you needed to buy runes for IP - so there are many various factors of why people didn't smurf as much before.\n\nIt goes without saying that smurfs really matter for this data, because one player can account for more than one ranked account.\n\nMy takeaways:\n\n- Game was growing a ton in Season 4-7 era. The peak was Season 7.\n\n- Game took a huge hit in Season 8. S8 was infamously very criticized by the community.\n\n- Despite smurfing and buying accounts becoming super common in the past few years, the amount of ranked players is quite stagnant. This suggests to me that the amount of unique players is declining.\n\n\nTo really say any interesting things about the popularity of the game, we would need different data than this. The best indicator would be total amount of hours played for multiple reasons:\n\n- The same person can't reasonably play on two accounts at the same time.\n\n- The data shown above counts a player with 10 ranked games and a player with 1000 ranked games as equally important.\n\nSo overall, hard to say much. League is obviously still very popular. I'd love to know what this data looks like with no smurfs though. I suspect 2016-2017 era would the highest by quite a decent margin as smurfing was less common then, but we can obviously never really know. Personally, I think one of the mains reasons smurfing isn't really addressed by Riot is because it inflates these stats nicely.\n\nMaybe one day Riot shows us better data, but this is the best we can do for now.",

Like I said, total ranked population is pretty flawed due to the amount of alt accounts going around nowadays.\n\nIn fact, I find it a bit alarming how the ranked population is unchanged with the current level of smurfing but it's impossible to quantify anything, so this is purely based on my intuition.",

They reverted it in the end though.\n\nSmurfing has definitely been relevant throughout the games history -- in more recent seasons you literally can't play duo q unless you smurf.\n\nIt also takes 8 hours to go from level 30 fresh account -&gt; master mmr (15 wins-0 losses)\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/G3rHDm6.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OaYiB9h.png",

And guess what, the exact same champions are being picked and the item rework is pointless. Zeri is a 7k hp mobility monster building titanic hydra, Twitch &amp; Draven are building Trinity force, Lucian/Nami still broken for 3 years in a row....\n\nThey make \"changes\" but don't change anything. Wake me up when they make meaningful changes to Mages and Melee supports, these classes have not been relevant for ages. \n\nBot lane has been so broken for so long now, toplaners irrelevant for years, midlane is pretty much utility role (Annie, Ahri, Nautilus). And what does riot decide to do? Rework ADC items ONCE AGAIN. Oh and here's a ridiculous TP change &amp; Lost chapter is 200g less just to spit in your face. \n\nDon't let Phreak's \"open communication\" fool you, because he's probably one of the most stuborn and arrogant people at Riot.",

                    "comment": "I wanna be as objective as possible since I'm an adc player so I'm kind of biased but Riot nerfed ADC hard enough that people just started playing other shit bot lane and since a lot of adc mains *only* play adcs, a lot of adc mains stopped playing for a bit. Here's a summary of the changes:\n\n- All adcs base AD down, AD per level up, health regen down, this made their early game much weaker\n\n- Fleet footwork (a keystone rune that charges up like stattik shiv and then heals and speeds you up when you auto) nerfed by lowering heal amount on minions, lowering move speed buff, removing bonus heal on crits\n\n- A lot of ADC items became higher priced + lower AD on them\n\n- Infinity edge crit damage removed, replaced with converting 15% of crits to true damage. So if you have 200 AD you crit 400 and 60 of that 400 damage will be true damage. This was nerfed again about 4-5 patches later to be only 10% instead of 15%. \n\nI grabbed some [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/Ri5gwCL) from the wayback machine for you to see op.gg's statistics for bot lane changing before and after. You can see that playing mages and other champs in the bot lane became popular enough that they changed the \"adc\" category to just say bottom now. With a couple exceptions, the only traditional adcs that were playable at the time were the ones that could go non-crit builds. Notably MF and draven going armor pen builds, Lucian going botrk black cleaver and kaisa with her stormrazor guinsoos nashors tooth build. Jinx and jhin were the only two above 50% while still building normal adc items.\n\nIt was definitely fun to watch proplay that year with all the weird shit going on bot lane. Just not a fun year for me. I barely played ranked at all that year. I think I had 15 games",

Bot lane essentially ruined the game for the rest of the team, and pro play was giga boring to watch all year. Worlds finals was 5 games Galio vs Malzahar. \n\nS8 riot realizes if they make fun champs and facilitate fun play styles, the game is actually more fun to play and to watch. We get Zoe, Kaisa, Pyke, Irelia, Aatrox, and Akali in one year, and meta shifts favor solo lane dominance over everybody is ADC\u2019s bitch boy. It really kicks off the modern era of league, and I don\u2019t think riot gets enough credit for un-fucking their game here.",

You'll notice a lot of the lvl 30 accounts he mentions don't have high winrates.\n\nThe most important part about smurfing is that 1 bought account that just plays 10 games and is abandoned counts the same as someone grinding 1k games on their main.

Only the least charitable interpretation possible would take that one off-hand sentence and base a whole attempt at discrediting the post from it. It's a very Reddit thing to do, so I guess I should expect it of you.\n\nCherry picking a few formulations out of context and attributing them some greater intent from me is pretty dishonest.

A game with a moderate playerbase playing a moderate amount of games is in a much healthier state than a game with a low playerbase playing an obscenely high amount of games. It's hard to account for smurfs I agree, but the number of unique and still somewhat active (like at least a couple games per week) players is a meaningful stat as well.",

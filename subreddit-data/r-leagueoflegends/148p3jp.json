I don't expect anything new to appear in near future (Seraphine/Orianna/Senna are just a Wild Rift transfers... those are not a new skins).

I'm sad that I couldn't get the border since I didn't start League until 3-4 years ago. \n\nI do also like Pajama Guardian MF. Its super cute but I don't play ADC often unless I am queuing up with friends.",

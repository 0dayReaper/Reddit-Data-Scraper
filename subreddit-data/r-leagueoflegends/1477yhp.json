More bans is even LESS fun than \"realizing ur champ is weak\" because it means people whose champ is strong don't even get to experience the maximum strength and will only get to play them on the weaker end. Let's say you give 2 bans and both teams remove all S tier champs. Now A tier champs are op AF in the microcosm created. So now you ask for three bans and on and on.

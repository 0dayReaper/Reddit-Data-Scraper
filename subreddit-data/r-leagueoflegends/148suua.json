Thank you for everything you and \n@Ququlani\n did. This one big\ud83d\udc96\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sheds some light on why older champs take too long to have their VO updated.\n\n\nAt this rate, you can safely expect that popular champs with outdated VOs will not get any updated VO soon (Miss Fortune). In fact, why even bother? It only makes sense not to update them to encourage sales of Legendary and Ultimate skins \n\nAnd unpopular champs with outdated VO will most likely not get a new VO ever. (Zilean, Xin Zhao etc.)\n\nis this the norm for the industry? almost a year to ship out 8-10 minutes of voice lines?",

            "comment": "its weird cuz who said it took the VO 11 months to be produced and shipped? the VO has several voice-lines about Naafiri so it wouldn\u2019t necessarily make sense to ship it so far before her release. riot has time lines and his voice update was probably coordinated to provide hype/teasers for Naafiri. Just taking a second and thinking about it and this is literally the most logical explanation.",

Cast the va's for the other languages, schedule them into the studio or hope they have a home studio,  get upper management to approve the recording and give notes, re-record any lines that notes been given on if they can't fix it in post. Post production, then there's lining it up for the best release window.",

Even then what sold them on updating the champs is that Nidalee and Varus have solid kits so they won't ever need a VGU.\n\n Basically this isn't the norm to get updated VAs, we aren't getting a new VA in 11 months.  The norm is no VA updates.  Only VGUs and ASUs care about updating voice lines essentially \n\n\n\nBut let's say you are Riot rn, why tf would you care about the lore nerds? They aren't really going to bring in any revenues lol\n\n\nThis is why they stopped the short stories and slowed down on updating lore etc.\n\nThey didn't lose anything aside from Necrit having a mental breakdown and I doubt that had in any form caused Riot to rethink their strategy lol\n\nPersonally this is a shame, many champ kits and models withstood the test of time but it can be very boring/stale/bland hearing the same 5 lines over and over specially if you main them\n\n\nTldr: You want to hear Runeterra characters speak with each other? Go play LoR you nerd \ud83d\udc80",

Angry, cocky, emotional, happy? How do you reflect that in his voicelines? What about nuances? What obvious traits do you want to tell? In Varus case there are some hints at him seeking redemption. What champions will Varus meet on his lane, which should he interact with regardless? How do these interactions look? How do his voicelines interact with his kit?\n\nThen the voicelines are passed to the Localization experts after some time. They need to check if everything can be localized easily or if you need to translate stuff differently for it to maybe not be offensive or because some saying doesn't work.\n\nThis may need some back and forth surley.\n\nAfter that a Voiceactor needs to be aquired for each language and a session has to be booked, in accordance with every VA's schedule. In Varus case, make this 3 per language.\n\nAnd after recording enough good takes, the sound designers have to work on it, deciding on filters, normalizing volume for each language with hours worth of sound data.\n\nAnd then, if everything comes together, leaving out possible bereaucractic hurdles and reevaluation, assuming that this is the only thing each person in the chain is working on it can be presented to quality assesment and then it may be shipped.\n\nOf course this would include that it should be instantly shipped, maybe there is some context it should be released to, then its pushed back.\n\nWithout complications, adsuming everyone is soley focused on this project, I would already think this takes 3 months or so.\n\nAnd Varus VU was surley not a high priority project.",

It\u2019s not very interactive to play against. Also because you can beat her in lane, but it won\u2019t matter when she AFK attaches to her Fed Top Laner that\u2019s strong outside of your control. \n\nEssentially she makes champions that are Meta/Strong in the patch even stronger, directly. Every other support can at least be focused/targeted while doing that. It can obviously get frustrating after seeing the Yuumi hop on the 5-0 Hecarim for the umpteenth Time and just act as a stat stick.",

I really hate when people get so tunnel-visioned on a single thing that they don't see how improvements can be made or changes can happen.\n\nYuumi's tactic of being attached to champions isn't a major problem. The duration of her attachment to another champion is. She need MUCH, MUCH stronger reasons to detach, or her attachment needs to be like Urgot's W, in that it has a duration early and eventually loses it once she maxes the skill out. If she had more reasons to not be on someone, that would clear up her issues without changing her drastically. Maybe remove her E since it's been a festering boil on her kit, and give her an ability that can only be used when detached, or give her R some kind of slow when she uses it while detached. There are tons of things that can be done to open the window of opportunity to hit her without deleting her from the game.",

None of that is a problem aside from the E. Her major problem is that she doesn't have enough windows of opportunity for opponents to punish her, meaning there needs to be elements of her kit that either time how long she can be attached or give her more to do when unattached. This is why I said remove her E and make it an ability that operates only when unattached. They do not at all need to butcher her kit if they were going to increase the windows of opportunity where she's unattached. She may need some stat readjustments depending on how long those windows end up being, but her kit can largely remain the same, as she's supposed to be stronger when attached and weaker when not.",

Yes, OBVIOUSLY her current design is being attached 95% of the time. \n\nThat 95% of the time is the problem. If it was 60% of the time or 50% of the time instead, this gives the opponents a lot more opportunities to deal with her directly. If her kit is stronger that 50% or 60% of the time where she's attached, that weakness AGAIN leaves her wide open for retaliation for the times where she isn't attached, thus improving player interaction with Yuumi. Her kit does not break down when her windows of opportunity are widened, no more than Karma's kit breaks down when she doesn't have Mantra available, or Gnar's kit breaks down when Mega Gnar is not active.\n\nYou are far too hung up on how she is now and not being able to see how she could be if changes are made.

You've presented zero compelling points and yet still just say \"You're missing the point\", no the other guys not missing the point since there isn't one. \n\nIll lay it out for you. Yuumi at her base is an enchanter character who has been designed around being attached. When NOT attached Yuumi does not have a Q, does not have a W, and CANNOT heal/buff teammates as an enchanter. She is a useless champ when not attached and no amount of number or stat tweaking will change that. \n\nYuumi would need entire abilities changed, quite drastically, in order to allow for gameplay that doesn't have her attached 90% of the time. The fundamental problem here is that you have now created a new champ called Yuumi whilst also deleting the old champ Yuumi which YOU wanted to avoid in the first place. \n\nI agree that Yuumi as a champ should have larger windows of weakness, but the kit as its currently designed it cannot fit those into it. Yuumi was not designed as the champ who attaches, she is the attached champ and to change that will change the champion.",

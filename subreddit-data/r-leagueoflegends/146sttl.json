    "postText": "I'm 2 years in, and I think I just drafted my last game probably ever.\n\nI've watched hours of videos explaining how builds work, how to properly counter, how to strategize, the role of each lane, etc. So, I think I'm doing a fairly good job at learning how to draft against certain picks, especially compared to what I'm assuming most players do.\n\nWith that being said, I try cooking into a few normal drafts, and I get absolutely destroyed by people who are apparently \"sophomores\" and yet are somehow going 27/2 as Zeri. Not only is that entirely unfun and impossible to play against in teamfights, but my \"die-hard\" fans are spam flaming me and telling me to resign because I'm trash, AND it takes me roughly 30 days to prepare our strat against Zeri in this patch\n\nSo, I thought, maybe I'll try the Co-Op vs Hanwha mode, because playing against LPL sucks when literally everyone is a smurf and telling my top laner they're gonna crush him...\n\nI swear to god, that was the absolute DUMBEST JUNGLER I have ever played against in any game, EVER. It makes the junglers in the LCS look like GODS in a vacuum. Even then, I still have fans getting pissed at me for not drafting perfectly every single game.\n\nI don't understand how you're supposed to draft at this meta, especially with 3 bans alone. I can't draft vs blue side, cause I spend the entire time removing Yuumi/Neeko/Maokai and flamed by people who backseat me like this is their job... And I can't learn vs scrims, cause I learn absolutely nothing by playing against teams that find scrims as meaningless as a literal wad of moist toilet paper.\n\nWhat am I expected to do? I really like cooking, and I \\*want\\* to learn how to draft... It just seems impossible to start.",

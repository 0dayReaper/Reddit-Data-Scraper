If you win lane you can starve vision and play picks well, but you really need to get rolling to be useful considering you\u2019re down 2+ levels compared to where a mid lane Ahri would be at the same point in the game.\n\nPretty much any time you pick Ahri support though, another champion would be better for most stuff she does. Unless you\u2019re just really good at Ahri pick Naut or something like that instead haha.",

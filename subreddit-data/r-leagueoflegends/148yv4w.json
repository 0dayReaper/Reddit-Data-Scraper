    "postText": "I am level 110 on league, I have a decent grasp of the game but still not the best. I only play unranked draft and for some reason the enemy laner is always this insane player that has like 200-900k mastery points on their champ and i get my ass kicked. Is there a way to get against players my skill level? The only reason I think this could be happening is because my friends I que with are higher levels then me but they are nowhere near the levels these people I'm against when I solo que.",

While its usually the case that they know their champ, first of all its only an indicator of how much they play it, not how well",

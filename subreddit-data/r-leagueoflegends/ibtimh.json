His winrate would be 30%, so going by stats he would be dogshit. Yet at the same time, he is still fundamentally broken. Riot decides to remove that passive, and some players complain about it since 30% winrate was not op.\n\nWhen balancing, you can NOT just look at the total winrate. You also need to take in the effectiveness when things go right. Shaco box cheese was not without drawbacks, but when it worked, it was dumb all around and not a sliver of fun for the receiver.",

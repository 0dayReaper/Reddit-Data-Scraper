Of these hundred games, how many would the gold player win?\n\nHow high is the Luck Factor? How would it look like if two random teams play each other, where the team has an average elo of diamond, vs gold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I know, 1v1 in league of legends discards a lot of skills that a high skill player need to have, like makro play and map awareness. What i want to know how high the skill factor is in an closed enviroment. In tend to think that in this game u have way lower chance to win against a player that is better than u, than in other games or gamegenres.\n\nFor example if i play a fighting game, and my opponent is really better than me, i would still win some by landing some lucky punches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit2: Since a lot of u (rightfully) say that 1v1 is not nearly as representative as i imagined, consider a slightly diffrent scenario. Lets make it a Team where the players are Diamond on average, versus a team where the players a gold on average.",

Gwen has a very peculiar flow to her. I'd actually argue that my lane mechanics somewhat suffer, which has led me to losing quite a few lanes. That's something I'm embarrassed about.\n\nHowever, I have ALWAYS been able to end up carrying the game. Here are a few reasons why.\n\n1. The gold player might have shitty lane mechanics, such as not pushing or freezing when needed. Sometimes they don't respect my ghost on wgwen and I chase them across the lane and kill them.\n\n2. Have absolutely 0  and I really mean 0 sens of macro. As gwen I often hang around invisible in side  lane bushes and the SECOND I see 3 or 4 enemies on other side kf the map, I CHARGE the sidelane. Since I eventually outduel most toplaners, I can simply dive them or ignore them and hit turret. \n\nWhy can I do this?\n\nEnemy arms when there is no objective. They don't plan the objective and ambush me. They panic and do both at the same time (I e, one person backs off from the tf so that they are fighting 3v4 on baron for example. They get swept and my team gets baron. If I die, cool, 4v2 and free baron so free turrets.\n\nIf not, my team pushes mid and I'm 1v1 vs enemy toplaner again. Back to square 1).\n\nAll that to say, that imo micro doesn't mean shit. The way with how this game works is that if you get champ diffed, (eg swain vs yi,) you get champed diff. That's it. Most game impacting decisions are macro orientated and gold players have shitty macro.",

Assume that \"gold\" and \"diamond\" translate directly into a numerical elo rating.\n2. Assume that these ranks were obtained in a 1v1 mode with the rules you set above and not in 5v5 SR.\n\nthen, using the elo rating system, we can predict the outcome of a game between any two players as long as we know their rating.\n\nfrom the wiki:\n\n&gt;The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.\n\njust keep in mind there is way too many factors in a 5v5 rank to strip it down and try to generalize how well a player would do in 1v1s. even within the same rank, player skill varies highly when it comes to individual aspects of the game.",

There are certainly some champions with hard to hit, high-impact skillshots that will on average favour the diamond player, but also allow for some \"lucky punches\" as you called them for the gold player. Contrary to that, if both just play e.g. Sett, then the only deciding factors are going to be spacing, reactions, knowledge of champion dmg and all-in potential and there will be close to no variance.",

One of the Turkish players successfully wins a one-on-one duel against Messi, taking the ball away from him. Now, that player might think to himself, \"Wow, Messi isn't really the greatest of all time. I managed to steal the ball from him.\" This analogy can help illustrate the perspective of low-ranked players when they boast, \"But I killed him once in lane.\"\n\nDon't you comprehend the insignificance of a solo kill or the outcome of just one lane? The complexity of this game is what makes it so challenging. Even a whole match of League of Legends is far from sufficient to showcase all your skills. It takes around 20-30 games to adequately demonstrate your abilities. It's reductive to narrow it down to a single lane or one game.\n\nDuring a 1v1 situation, there are very limited opportunities to truly showcase your game understanding and skill. It becomes restricted to a single champion facing off against another, whereas the game itself takes place on an expansive map with diverse objectives and an extensive roster of champions. This vast variety of champions allows for countless combinations and strategies to be explored, highlighting the depth and complexity of the game.",

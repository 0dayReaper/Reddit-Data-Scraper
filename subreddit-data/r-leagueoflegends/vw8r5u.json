Streamer got sniped by 4 people. 2 in her team(Nasus, Jhin) and 2 in the enemy team(Evelynn, Senna)\n\n2. Can't end game by voting surrender since you cannot get the numbers\n\n3. Nasus and Jhin cleared minions to prevent the nexus from being destroyed\n\nSenna and Evelynn prevented her from doing backdoor(Nasus and Jhin tell them where she is)\n\n4. Game goes on for over 3 hours. Death count of streamer was over 120\n\n5. Streamer got banned 14 days by riot (snipers reported her by negative attitude and intentional feeding). Some say why not just leave the game, but she would've got banned for afk then.",

You can say shibal obviously in KR servers but they lack the English skills to know where fuck is allowed.\n\nI don't blame them, but seriously an auto translator would pickup that I was frustrated and swore, not that I abused someone lol. There's a profanity filter for a reason. This isn't just for 10 year olds.\n\nKoreans honestly suck at this game and they blame everyone but themselves.

It's almost like they want to ban you rather than stopping people from flaming.\n\nAnd i used to live in Korea too and i paid to transfer my EUW account there.

Senna is attacking you from 1.5 screens away for 70% of your health bar a shot, and Nasus Jhin are telling her where your backdoor attempts are at all times. If you somehow dodge her, you have to deal with the 2.5k AP Evelynn oneshotting you with E.\n\nOk, but what about the other team? Same problem, different champions. You try to backdoor and Nasus with his 3k stacks one taps you. If you get past him or avoid him somehow, Jhin rockets up with his 2.2k AD and one taps you instead.\n\nEven worse, siege and super minions keep scaling. 2 hours in and siege minions have 10,850 health and 220 AD. Supers have the same hp, but **825 AD** and 100 armor. So once supers start spawning, you have a mini raid boss minion every 30s that most champions start failing to be able to deal with.\n\nIt's the same with all of the very long summoners rift games. Both sides try to turtle and stall while stacking up, until the game reaches the point where the 2 stallers can deal with the 3 real players by themselves. Then they hold the game hostage however long they want, since there's no realistic way to break the stalemate at that point unless one of the real players was on an infinite scaler themselves or took gathering storm on a high enough ranged champion to try and deal with the fake players.",

If you don't 100-0 him in one shot (spoiler you never will because of his ult) he will heal your damage on like 3 minions while you needed to ate all the damage in the trade with no way to be healthy. I've opened a ticket to Riot and even made a post here to address the issue but looks like his playrate top is too low to change something in his kit",

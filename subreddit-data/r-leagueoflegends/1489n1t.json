    "postText": "I like that they want to flatten the curve and are adding in Emerald as a new rank but after I saw this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/145d4i2/where\\_will\\_riots\\_new\\_rank\\_distribution\\_put\\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/145d4i2/where_will_riots_new_rank_distribution_put_you/) I think its been utilized wrong? (or someone can explain it to me would be nice)\n\nI get that it needs to be there to absorb the shift but wouldn't it make sense to squish down high elo to fit into the new distribution as well? Basically anything below Diamond can expect half to a full rank up and thats fine by me if they want to create this artificial rank up but a flat 20-20-20 down the middle seems like too much and we end up with Silver in Platinum and Emerald containing high Gold, the entirety of Platinum and Diamond 4.\n\n[Riot's version](https://preview.redd.it/cdwns3fcjq5b1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aa512fb89d77eebe468546f5b28aaf6363603fb3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[u\\/just\\_me929's graph](https://preview.redd.it/rgs2vo4wmq5b1.png?width=835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=72ddbe30ac867e74555e0c35b543095a50f9b3d4)\n\nRather than the 20-20-20, I think Gold can become the new rank with the most population at 25% and shrinking Emerald to make up for this so high Silvers/Golds wouldn't skip 2 ranks\n\n[My version \\(not 100&amp;#37; accurate but a rough representation, cutoff points can be adjusted accordingly, esp in Masters idk how you would decide that](https://preview.redd.it/1lw0893dpq5b1.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b4832d632aacce04ff1b4173b6029997ff65e259)\n\nAnd I know this will feel bad for those players (I myself is around this rank) but maybe 'demoting' (at least some of) Diamond 4s making up Emerald 1 and Masters low LP become new D1-2, old D1-2 now D3-4. This will close the gap on D2+ being much better than those in D4 despite being in the same rank as well as maybe help with the problem of having like what, 6 thousand players in NA Masters?\n\nNot sure how promos and qualifying would work there now but I feel like this would make it more competitive at Diamond and above regardless and maybe those who do get 'demoted' this way wouldn't mind if it makes their rank mean more when they achieve it?\n\nAnd again none of the numbers are definite and I just want to convey that 1) Emerald should not span over 3 old ranks and 2) Emerald and Diamond ranks can be used in a better way\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

A way for riot to ignore the actual mmr and matchmaking issues they themselves have created throughout the last few seasons (lp inflation, bot accounts, account buying, removal of smurf queue, etc.), by adding into the game an artificial and imaginary rank boost for hardstuck players to feel good about themselves while struggling to make the climb. And it will backfire, causing more issues.",

Adding more elos won't change this fact, and will not really fix matchmaking. It might be a temporary fix early in the season, but it will devolve into the same problem after a short amount of time.",

Who knows how it will really turn out, there is a good chance that it will barely get better, but I think having less players that someone can match with is a really good change for having quality games",

The new elo bracket distribution is just a way to \"gift\" hardstuck players with the illusion that they belong in a higher bracket, and that the reason they were hardstuck in the first place was just because the elo system was not accurate in representing the player's actual rank. Its just a marketing strategy to give some happiness to the playerbase, especially the low elo player base.",

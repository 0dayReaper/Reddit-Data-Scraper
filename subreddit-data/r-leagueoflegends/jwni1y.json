Worlds finals appearance or bust.  \n\nHowever Perkz is a big deal identitywise so it'll be interesting to see what happens.\n\nI REALLY REALLY hope FNC manages to do well with their new ADCs tho. Its still a really solid roster and theres solid ADCs available. Who will have a worldclass support to bring them up a notch if theyre up to it.\n\nAlso... Sam Matthews must fucking HAAAAAATE Carlos at this point lmfao. Signs Caps as a Free agent. Allegedly blocks Perkz from going to FNC. Signs Rekkles as a free agent.\n\n\nEDIT: I gotta add this because I dont see it mentioned enough. Rekkles has been around for a VERY long time now. He's still reaching new levels. He was a free agent and there wasnt a single report of him going to NA. Now ofc he's gonna be paid super well in G2 but I really respect the fact that he's so far into his career and wants to win that badly still.",

This boy wants to win worlds and he has better chances in this G2 lineup over FNC. Over the last couple of years the G2 management has shown more hunger and effort to become the no.1 team in the world compared to fnatic. I was hoping he would stay until he retires. Worst day as a fnatic fan for sure.\n\nI know G2 fans are worried that his playstyle might not fit but i can tell you that rekkles matured over the years and hes much more flexible as a player now than what he used to be. Hes by no means a KDA player anymore,hes willing to take risks in lane , play around his team but also being able to solo carry. For me personally the best western player of all time. Hes the most consistant player out there and i can only imagine what he will do with this G2 lineup.\n\nNow this is a tough time as a fnatic fan. No money and no upgrades means a tough year is ahead of us. Im ngl im gonna root a lot for G2 this year,not because of hate but because im really interested what this lineup can do.",

By blocking Perkz to FNC, G2 offloaded the biggest player in the west to C9, who funded the buyout by selling their shit midlaner to FNC, who then proceed to lose a top tier ADC to their direct competitors in G2.\n\nIt's the literal worst off-season moves I can imagine. FNC just feeding their competition.",

No one embodies that more than Martin Larsson.\nRekkles. He is one of the most experienced and celebrated marksmen in Europe and the World, but regardless of that resum\u00e9, he has never won an international trophy, but he has never lost his drive.\nAnd what's more is that even a couple of years ago, even making a Championship Final seemed out of reach.\nUntil 2018, everything was set up to perfection for Martin and for Fnatic. They reconquered Europe after years of G2 domination, Caps stepped up as a true carry, and they faced an IG in the Finals they had beaten twice in the group stage. But as we all know, it was a tragedy, it was a quick exit. It was a shameful display, and what was worse, it felt like a lost opportunity that may never come again, for Rekkles, for Fnatic and for Europe.\nThe LPL rose as the unbeateable beast we know them to be. And the LPL would dominate the World Championship two times in a row. But Rekkles, he did not stop fighting, and in fact in 2019, he was finally able to put one of his biggest demons to bed, with Uzi and RNG.\nAnd now? Now we're here. 2020. Where the expectations for Fnatic were at their lowest ahead of this best of five versus Top Esports, the first seed from the LPL. The LPL that has beaten EU down in these best of fives, time and time again; and JackeyLove, standing tall and poised to win his second World Championship.\nBut so far we haven't gotten LPL domination, we haven't gotten the JackeyLove highlight reels, and we've gotten Rekkles and Hylissang lane kingdom.\nIt all comes down to this next game. Demons can be slayed, expectations be damned, and Rekkles can cement himself as the player he always wanted to prove he was.\nIn this next game. It's all up to him and Fnatic to make their dreams come true.",

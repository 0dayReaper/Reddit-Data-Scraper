To winning LCS for the 1st time, and doing it with a pentakill vs tsm, to then losing to brtt at worlds, to then joining TSM, having to carry an expired EU legend, then fucking hoisting the trophy back to back, proving all those clg haters, to then retiring for a little quickie, to coming back , to getting 1 shot by viktor, to being told on reddit you were getting kicked, to joining TL with ur CLG trio squad reunited, to having one of the worst tragedies and persevering when others would've just sank into despair, and becoming a back to back champion......\n\nMan, Doublelift was really someone I followed for a decade, and fuck it just stings to know hes finally done...\n\njust feel so empty man...\n\nEdit: Fuck I realizing I'm nearing 27 as well, and saw a parallel in my life to DL's, and thru his tragedy, I was able to be a better son for my mom, or atleast work towards it, for fear of never knowing what our last moment together would've been. Maybe it sounds weird as just a fan of his, but his loss really made me start to treasure what I had, even if our relationship was rocky at times, at the end I always knew she loved me, and seeing those vids of DL just talking about wanting to be their son again, and wanting to heal that relationship, it did resonate with me. Lo and behold, a year later I lost my mom to cancer, so I dunno if DL will ever read this but man thank you, I don't know what would've been if I wasn't able to tell my mom I love her before she passed...",

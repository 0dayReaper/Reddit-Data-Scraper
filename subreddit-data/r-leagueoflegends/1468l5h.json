Upgrade over Rekkles and Advienne? \n\nHopefully these were the missing pieces FNC needed to finally contest for the title again (considering they pretty much need to win the split to even have a shot at getting to worlds)",

Then they had to replace the new supp by Klaj. Then in summer YellowStar is back, then Gamsu is out and Kikis steps in. Meanwhile there was a Twitter war with Rekkles, Freeze and Forgiven... Last time we really had Rekkles \"tweeting\".\n\nBesides all that, this roster still managed to go to IEM finals, losing to SKT but taking RNG and QG (with Doinb and Uzi at the time).... So weird that this messy roster got this good showing on a tournament.",

Last time Humanoid did it was Worlds last year while Caps hasn't come close to that level since 2020, arguably since 2019 since all Caps really did in 2020 was dominate Bdd when Bdd played one of his absolute worst series of his entire career.  \n\nWhen worlds comes around this year there will be a 3-4 year gap for Caps since he last played at or close to his peak level and only 1 year for Humanoid. I think assuming that Humanoid has a greater chance of approaching that peak level again than Caps is not unreasonable or far stretched at all.",

He didn't look bad play wise at all, probably somewhere 4-6th on lec supports, but watching any of fnatics out of game content he seemed like such a positive force for team morale, super positive and easy to work with guy, this is probably equally if not more important as long as his skill level is ok. We've seen super team after super team on paper fail to get results, how a team clicks together is usually more important (look at mad lions, arguably none of them other than elyoya is a contender for best in their role, but they still always outperform expectations in lec)",

                    "comment": "9th place is a bit extreme lol, this roster is a huge upgrade from the winter split  \n\n\nOscar has huge potential and showed tons of promise last split, Trymbi is defo an upgrade over advienne. Don't know much about Noah but he seems to be a big deal and can't possibly be worse than Rekkles",

He does not care about the game where he earns his money. \n\nRekkles was the by far most stable player in FNC. There's simply nothing you can do if the enemy team decides to four man camp the living shit out of you or your mid/jgl duo runs it down like always. I can't believe people still defend Humanoid. \n\nYou want a face and definition of \"paycheck stealer\"?\n\nHumanoid is your man. \n\nI can understand if Rekkles nopes out, I wouldn't be able to play with a hard inting midlaner for a damn split.",

Not sure if you saw the graphic I posted, but that's only recently, going back 8 years it doesn't get better.\n\nNA LCS Spring 2015: 9th  \nNA LCS Spring 2016: 10th  \nNA LCS Spring 2017: 5/6th  \nNA LCS Spring 2020: 7th  \nNA LCS Spring 2021: 5/6th\n\nMy post was also low-key a jab at the latest LCS drama and how stupid the slot system is. Dig can forever fumble around in the dumpster and place dead last and never be booted out. Needs to change, regardless of your opinion on which players they hire this year.\n\nIt was also a low-key sarcastic joke that Dig is just silently waiting for their slot to be worth more money so they can sell it and make more $$$ than attempting to win Worlds or really anything at all.",

DIG has passed through multiple different ownership and management groups in that 8 year period. It's like pretending post-MSG CLG is the same as HotshotGG CLG. DIG were bought by the Philadelphia 76ers last year and they decided to invest more in the LCS. They shouldn't be ridiculed by the community because they roster they created, that the whole community thought would do well, underperformed. So their past performances are pretty irrelevant? Especially the ones fking pre-franchising... Like we are saying current DIG deserves to be kicked out of the league because an entirely different ownership group got 9th/10th 8 years ago? Also, why are we just looking at Spring? In the year immediately preceding franchising, DIG shelled out for Ssumday &amp; Chaser, then shelled out even more to replace 3/5ths of their roster for Summer where they made top 4 kicking C9 out of playoffs, pretty telling you didn't include that...\n2. The slot system will never change and it's intensely stupid the community is constantly calling for it. LCS teams paid $10-30 million to get into the league, under the assumption they would have a guaranteed slot. That slot is also the main asset driving LCS teams' valuation, as their revenue streams are otherwise garbage. A change to this system would either require buying out all the LCS teams' slots for \\~$200 million, buying out a couple slots for \\~$40 million + compensating LCS teams for their loss of exclusivity, adding a couple more tens of millions. Are the benefits of changing this system really worth those costs? Couldn't that money be better spent elsewhere? And don't buy that franchising is really the problem in NA, EU/KR have franchised systems and perform fine.\n3. You do realize this is the strategy of basically every VC or sports-team owned team in the league? They all buy in, spend money to improve the value of their slot, then sell it off to the next rube for massive $, like Misfits or Rogue in LEC. But that doesn't mean they don't care about winning. Part of improving the value of the team is building a fanbase/brand value through winning and these teams are spending money (however inefficiently) to that end. My point was that DIG is clearly still invested in the league, they spent big this year, and if you care about previous years, they also spent a lot in 2017 and 2020, only 2021 did they go budget.",

    "postText": "Why is Baron so squishy and easy to take now? Literally 2 champions can be soloing it pretty easily, if you make a play on bot lane and 2 out of 5 enemies are missing then they are likely using that to easily get baron. Since when has been taking baron so easy? I remember when taking baron would at least need 3-4 to people and actually hurt.",

    "postText": "#Delete her!!!\n\n___\n\n\nNo, okay, for real.\n\nLet's fix Yuumi mechanically and thematically.\n\nYuumi is a character that can attach forever to an allied champion, which is the main source of frustration for everyone who plays against her. There is barely any counterplay to it, and it provides really boring gameplay for the Yuumi player.\n\nBefore the rework, Yuumi would have to jump out occasionally to proc her passive and sustain her high mana costs, but with the tragic rework, that mechanism is gone.\n\nThe current Yuumi barely benefits getting out of champs at all post-laning phase, other than extending her ward range for 1 second and jumping back in.\n\nThe reasoning Riot gave for the rework is that they want her to be a beginner champ that is good for newcomers to learn the game.\n\nI disagree with that change because it teaches nothing other than the pace of the game. If that is her only intended purpose, then she should NOT be allowed in ranked or pro play and should be free for every account. It's as simple as that.\n\nThat's not what I think they should do with her.\n\n**Yuumi is a cat**. Let me ask you this: [What are cats known for?](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6c/be/8c/6cbe8c449196e98408574f37509d503e.jpg) \n\nThe cat wants out, so you open the door, but when you close the door, the cat wants in. Would it make sense thematically that Yuumi the cat only wants to cuddle and never go outside? Heck no!\n\n---\n\n#Give her a new passive: \"**Outside Cat**\"\n\n*Yuumi yearns for independence and gains a stack (max 1) whenever she leaves an allied champion to be on her own. She gains an additional stack if she stays 5 seconds outside of her ally (to a grand total maximum of 2 stacks).*\n\n*Yuumi's E ability consumes 1 stack and is 100% effective if it does so. If Yuumi has no stacks, her E ability is 50% effective in all regards (movement speed, attack speed, shield amount, mana gained).*\n\n---\n\nWith this passive we have reduced her power level as well as introduced counterplay to her AFK playstyle, if she wants to be a menace she will have to go through great risk by timing her jumps outside.\n\nThis incentivises Yuumi players to track the cooldown of CC available to the enemy at any given moment instead of eating ramen and watching Netflix while spamming E.\n\n--\n\nWhat to do with the old passive? Give it to her for free, make it so that the current person she sits on is her best friend. That would fit thematically with cat's impulsiveness of finding a \"[new best friend](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9482808064/h765855AB/my-new-best-friend)\" \nThe current passive is genuinely bugged, coded wrong or has the wrong description. You can basically never switch your best friend even if you stay outside your laning partner the entire game.\n\n___\n\nConclusion:\n\n* AFK Yuumi is ~50% weaker.\n\n* Yuumi will expose herself to danger, providing counter play opportunities for enemy team.\n\n* The Yuumi player is more than a spectator and needs to think about surroundings.\n\n* The Yuumi player can no longer meet random ADC afk/troll and lose the \"best friend\" passive.\n\n___\n\nWhy I play Yuumi: I have a nerve condition that prevents me from being able to right click for an extended period of time. If I would limit myself to 2 hours of gameplay then I can play anything, but occasionally I play for 10 hours straight and that's where I have no other option than playing a champ that is less intensive on my nerves. But I want this champion to be healthy and currently she is not and Riot is not doing a great job at balancing her.\n\n[opgg](https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/Rich%20Fortune)\n\nNerfing her to trash tier is as good as just disabling her. \n\nThank you for reading.",

Jumping out to block the jhin W, R or cait R can make or break fights. \n\nPre-rework, jumping in an ally from the outside procced Aerie, giving them a tiny but vital shield in clutch fights. (No longer works)\n\nWeaving in autos and baiting out spells with quick jumps makes for fun gameplay to me as I expose myself to risk, but with the rework, the auto attack range has been reduced as well as the rewards for trying, so now she is pure afk champ, so I don't play or enjoy her as much.\n\nAdditonally, in lane I would spend 50% of my time outside of the carry using my autos just like a janna, lulu or soraka would, so there wasn't much difference in skill ceiling there. But, now that the attack range has been reduced, it's not as viable so maybe 15% of the lane I'm outside now.\n\n2) \n\nWithout a consistent duo partner, you (or at least *me*), wouldn't be able to reach diamond 2 by watching Netflix during gameplay. I've generally only played with randoms and you really have to pay attention to which team member is suicidal because you don't want to give 600g for free. If I had a duo that one-tricked heca or yi I could have easily been carried to master but then it wouldn't have been \"my acheivement\". I could probably float around P1/P2 while watching Netflix since I know the champ well but I expect most Netflix Yuumis to peak around G1. \n\nI generally don't watch something else unless the game is ultra one-sided in either way where you know for sure it's gonna be ff15.",

Even if u would heal for 10 hp its better than healing nothing. Also with this mechanic u can just build it up before the teamfight.",

That's \"changing something for pro play\", the yuumi is forced to get out or be barely useful in extended teamfights.\n\n&gt;Even if u would heal for 10 hp its better than healing nothing\n\nIf yuumi could only shield for half of her current amount, teams would pick lulu/janna/karma over yuumi.\n\nCurrently her shield value is from 80-180 (just now, nerfed from 90-210) and you're saying 10hp shield would be enough?

[This is the live LPL game](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1845882660?t=07h28m27s) that was happening as you wrote your first message.\n\nHere is a transcript of the events:\n\n    LEVEL 1\n    1:37 out\n    1:51 in\n    \n    3:44 out\n    3:52 carry dead...\n    (double reset, does not count as out)\n    5:15 in\n    7:30 out\n    7:36 in\n    7:41 out\n    7:47 yuumi dead\n    (reset, does not count)\n    \n    8:26 into jungler as carry is resetting\n    8:30 out to kill wards with jungler not harrassing anyone and not in lane so doesnt count\n    9:02 in \n    13:24 out\n    13:27 in\n    \n    14:23 out\n    14:28 in. \n    \n    Laning phase is over, carry and yuumi are now mid.\n\n\nDuring those 14 and a half minute, Yuumi spent a total of 42 seconds outside of her carry and 14 of those seconds were level 1 when enemy Milio had not yet leveled up his Q. Additionaly, 20 of those seconds were spent warding, not harrassing as you claimed. \n\nYour perception of 50% of the lane harrassment is astronomically drifted from reality of this game where she spent actually 5% of her time outside of the carry at all and only half of it was utilized for harassing exclusively in level 1.\n\nIf you think this game unfairly represents how Yuumi is currently played you're welcome to link a more accurate VOD, this one was only picked as it was literally happening as you wrote that comment.",

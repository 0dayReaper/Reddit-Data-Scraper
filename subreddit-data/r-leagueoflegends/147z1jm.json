It's why cleanse is actually a pretty decent counter to a varus, it destroys a ton of his burst damage if you just snap out of his ult immediately and forces him to have to keep autoing you to get off his passive.",

Worse even, he ran into baron blindly instead of waiting for his team for a potential steal/wipe there. The fact that the rest of your team managed to pull back from the Mundo (who has half of his teams deaths) mistakes is a compliment to them.",

I think him TPing there with rift herald baited the enemy team into trying to dive and end the game, which they then fucked up and got themselves killed. It certainly wasn't a play that was guaranteed to work, but it was probably better odds than trying to defend; best case scenario is that red team leaves and just does infernal dragon instead.",

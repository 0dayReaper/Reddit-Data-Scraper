Easiest way Todo that is with the current method where set amount of hits kill them. Gives players a good rough uptime to deal with them. Thou on live it's ridiculous how a Leona w can randomly one shot them which is why the some change is happening since people don't even need to work to kill them.",

Other champions that were also picked a lot.\n\nIIRC I think the real reason she was reworked was so they could implement her new passive, which is the random RNG seeds that spring up. You get more seeds/plants, it's pseudo-random, but they had to make the plants weaker to do it. I think the primary reason was because they wanted more seeds/plants, not because the old plants were too strong (in a way that they couldn't just balance/tweak it).",

Like big aoe spells have lower cast ranges because they\u2019ll hit anyways and spells that serve as defining \u201cedge of your range\u201d spells also should be cast at max range, like syndra q. Some ranges just isnt very intuitive, like your for zyra your qwe is long as fuck range but then all of a sudden your huge fucking aoe ult is short cast range, but the expansion can actually reach, so it makes sense for it to be cast at max range. \n\nWalk to position is good for abilities that have a shorter range than intuitively believed, so you dont just chuck it and have it land short. I personally think walk to position is dogshit for any ability that isnt cc(annie r) or any ability part of a combo.",

And even when you are missing them, you're only looking at smaller numbers if you only succeed in landing 1 or 2.  The second hit almost breaks even and third onwards is strictly better damage at all levels (with more opportunities to land at levels 11 and 16).\n\ntl;dr : ulti gets a massive 40% buff and significantly improved AP scaling from level 11 onwards\n\nEDIT: The 20-30 + 5% AP buff is per CHAMP hit, not SHOT hit.  So those numbers can go a fair bit higher in a clustered teamfight scenario.",

The wave early on (and you opponent being in range to threaten you without ever backing off for cs/to dodge spells/to ward/to avoid a gank/etc.) is almost never happening enough that you are unable to use your ranged autos occasionally on minions. And you only need a whopping 2 extra passive autos (or 1 passive auto on champions) to go even, which isn't a hard ask when Xerath should be farming enough CS for 5+ extra passives before his first back.",

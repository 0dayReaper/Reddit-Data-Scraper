LCS matches this Summer will now be played on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays starting at 2:00 PM PT / 5:00 PM ET at the Riot Games Arena. \n\n&gt; Updated information on Summer Split, including tickets and revised match schedule, will be available on Friday, June 9 at 9:00 AM PT / 12:00 PM ET on Lolesports.com.\n\n&gt; \u201cDelaying Summer Split was not a decision we took lightly, but ultimately the dialogue between the league, the LCSPA, and teams provided the space to realign on shared goals for the future of the LCS and NACL. Building for the long-term sustainability and success of the LCS ecosystem is the win-condition for us all,\u201d said Naz Aletaha, Global Head of LoL Esports. \u201cWe want to thank the LCS fans, players, and teams for their patience during this period and look forward to seeing players back on the LCS stage next week.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LCS, the LCSPA, and a team representative chosen by the 10 LCS organizations have met regularly during this period. Throughout these discussions, the group engaged in dialogue across a wide range of topics for both LCS and NACL players. Based on what is financially scalable and sustainable for the ecosystem, league, and teams, the discussions resulted in the following:\n\n&gt;* A new NACL business model, in addition to the previously committed $300,000, that shares revenue between the tournament operator and participating teams to drive towards long-term sustainability\n&gt;* Improvements to the NACL governance model, including a Team Participating Agreement (TPA) and vetting process of the participating team organizations\n&gt;* Minimum 30-day notice and severance requirement for players earning up to 1.5 times the league minimum salary and minimum two-week termination notice for non-resident LCS players (players and teams are free to negotiate terms over-and-above this)\n&gt; * Creation of a working group between teams and the LCSPA to better optimize scrim schedules\n&gt;* Reinforcement of healthcare insurance requirements for international LCS players when they arrive in the U.S.\n&gt; * Refinement of working procedures between the LCS, LCSPA, and teams to continue conversations around the improvement of the competitive landscape in North America\n\n&gt; \u201cThe LCS Summer Split kicks off Wednesday and we\u2019ll build toward the Final at the Prudential Center in August and Worlds this fall,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Fernandez, Senior Director, Esports, Americas. \u201cWe are committed to bringing the best of League to the NA community and will be continuing to evolve the LCS with that goal in mind.\u201d",

I'm almost positive they're going to settle on $9 or so, even though they're threatening a strike iirc.",

Riot dropped Academy because the Orgs voted to do it. The Orgs were the financially liable party.\n\nI would assume the PA sent their demands to Riot because someone there understands that Riot holds all the cards when it comes to the LCS. But Riot's initial response was a complete \"get bent\" because they are not where the problem lies.\n\nSo the fact that Riot gave them ANYTHING is probably a rather large win. Does this really protect any of these players? Not even slightly. And Riot has shown that they could not give less of a fuck, the teams can field whoever the fuck they need to to put a product on, backlash or no.",

The only fault I really give riot is for axing the tier 2 scene with no communication. I don\u2019t think riot should be on the hook for money to fund that scene when it\u2019s the teams themselves that caused it to fail to begin with. Years and years of egregious spending on superfluous infrastructure and overpaying amateur players with no recouping of funds because that scene was not profitable, does not mean, in my opinion, that it\u2019s riot\u2019s problem. The 3 other major regions have had far less issues with their amateur scene and all have way more future sustainability with their systems as well as more international success (which I know is a side point to the main issue here). \n\nThe asks were high too begin with and left very little room for reasonable and meaningful change from riot\u2019s side, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing being reflected by these agreements here. While I\u2019m glad the PA did SOMETHING for the amateur scene that was abruptly and unjustly cancelled, I still think they fell very very short of any real substantive change or action to improve the quality of the scene or it\u2019s longevity. I think they focused on some issues and points that would neither be reasonable to ask for nor would they be beneficial enough to really spark a forward direction for the scene. I obviously don\u2019t have those answers myself, but I really feel like it was a haphazard and poorly thought out walkout and while it did get them a seat at the table, I think in the long run this is a humongous L for players both in the tier 1 and tier 2 scenes",

Seems like they're still in-line for a steep cut in salary on top of playing in a pointless league with no hope for promotion that will get even less viewers with top teams pulled.\n\nI honestly don't even see the point of Riot running an official academy league anymore. There's nothing to play for like promotion in past leagues or regional rivalry like in EUM, and there are no good players that are being generated from it either. You don't even get the benefit of \"looking like a professional sports team that cares about player development\" anymore, because all of the teams dipped.\n\nThere's no glory, no money, no excitement, no popularity, no player-development, and no more pretending there is player-development. It's literally the most useless sports league I've ever seen in my life at this point.",

It has no impact on the academy stuff. \n\nLast part about refining the comms between LCSPA, teams, and LCS sounds nice. IDK if it actually means anything though. \n\nThe old academy system wasn't profitable, mostly because teams were overpaying academy players and attaching insane buyouts to their contracts so they could recuperate the losses on salaries. I understand that teams are hurting because they're spending a shit ton on salaries, but [they're the ones that drove the salaries up](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Bike-Fall.jpg). They chose to hire multimillion dollar imports, and they're choosing to pay their bottom feeders 400k salaries. They chose to pay their \"academy veterans\" way more than they needed to. I just don't have any sympathy for the orgs. I'm all for budget cuts, but they should have done them where it made sense.",

The only thing that actually can make riot not scrap the t2 scene is making them realize that again, bad optics to not invest in the future of the league because it shows the Devs don't believe league is gonna exist in a few years instead of the grand 10-15 year plan they are gas lighting everyone into believing.

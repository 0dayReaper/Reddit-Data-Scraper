    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI have recently started playing League of Legends after having played Wild Rift for a year or so. In Wild Rift, I exclusively played Katarina and Irelia. Now in League, I play them also and have found my understanding of how the champions work has really paid off when playing them in the real game. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m looking for a third champion to add to my pool. In wild rift, there wasn\u2019t really any other champion that caught me like Irelia and Kat, which is odd considering lots of people say Yone and Yas are similar. \n\nSince LoL has many other champs, many I don\u2019t know if, I\u2019m hoping someone can suggest champions that provide the same satisfaction as the two I play already.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "What is it that draws you to Irelia and Katarina?  If you're looking for someone with a lot of dashes and the like, Akali is a good choice.  Actually, I would check out what other assassins are in the game (even if you tried them in Wild Rift, you might enjoy them more with this control scheme).\n\nIf you liked Irelia, I might suggest Bel'Veth or Gwen if you like someone with some mobility and focused on basic attacks.  Yasuo and Yone are also examples of that.\n\nOf course, if you're willing to spend the time on it, I think it's worth trying out anyone who looks like an interesting, even if they're not your usual thing.  You might end up liking something you didn't realize, or you may find someone you like for their personality/theme instead of just their gameplay.  Mages like Ahri and Zoe have some similarities to assassins, with high potential mobility and strong burst damage.",

            "comment": "Sounds like you are a midlane player. Look, what I'll recommend is a sin and many will be against it, but fuck it: Samira\n\nShe is an adc, yeah, but I've played her midlane and really had a good time (the enemy midlaner probably didn't)\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\n\n1. You are a ranged champion, and you sre AD, you can poke down the enemy with autos so you can all in later\n\n2. You have great *OFFENSIVE* mobility. Ehich, like Yasuo, can only be used on enemy units (minions, champions, monsters)\n\n3. You have a good defensive tool on your W which will block any projectile in any direction for a short while\n\n4. You have Wild Rift Katarina's R when you charge your passive (if you don't charge it, you have no R)\n\nCons:\n\n1. You miss half of your passive since Samira needs someone else to root/stun to trigger it. Will only use it if your support is a roamer like Nautilus or Blitzcrank, or if your jungler lands a CC out of vision\n\n2. You are bad at setting up ganks. Without a support, you can't trigger Samira's knock up, and you will depend of managing the wave state or your jungler being good/autosuficient\n\n3. You are still an adc. If a mage or assassin catches you off guard or poorly positioned, you'll die\n\nTake Samira into account and practice her, she even has a huge sword for meele autos (those deal extra magic damage)",

I wanted to share a thought that comes in my mind everytime I meet trolls/afk players that ruins game on purpose and that clearly play for lose. Why not just develop a way to substitute them after being confirmed to be trolls with league own ai bots that has prooven to being way more better than years ago ? at least they would cause less damage than a player that knows how to ruin a game.",

    "postText": "I really think that league should open up the door to community made skins. Also it would be super cool that instead of skin shard you earn different parts of a skin. You could equip different parts of different skins together to get your own unique look on your champion. I mean we already have skin shards, it could be that only community skins can be earned while officially released skins can only be bought. I think this would be really cool.",

I'm getting at least 1 friend request a day of boost accounts promoting, the games always have one (or a duo) of level 30 accounts with random names, I just can't anymore. 90%wr Rengar on a normal lobby, 100% wr mid laner with only 7 ranked games and the rest being intro bot games.  \nI know I'm bad, but at least let me have fun while trying to climb. I've been treying for years to get to plat, I got 3 times into promos and even if I play out of my mind or play like shit, it won't matter, cuz the smurf will win, I just have to get lucky that they end up on my team.   \nHow are we supposed to enjoy a game where the outcome only depends on if you have a smurf on your team or in the enemy's team?  \nI just want to improve without feeling exhausted or tilted cuz the \"first time\" vayne top is 7/1 and is comming for a 1 v 5 penta",

You can\u2019t write an AI for this problem.\n\nWith old Smurf queue for example, they had pretty wide sweeping markers that ended up collecting a good number of players starting ranked off on a statistically strong if not slightly over performing trajectory and these players would end up with a 54-60% win rate in \u201ctheir MMR\u201d despite a number of these games being played with/against other flagged smurfs so the system marks these players as smurfs as well. \n\nYou\u2019d need to do thinks like tracking accounts playing from the same IP within a week (before tech bros crawl up my ass yes I know IPs can be recycled but they don\u2019t recycle them while they\u2019re providing internet service in the moment) and then from there tracking things they traditionally track like APM, key binds, etc",

They said in their post that the main issue was it put returning accounts in smurf queue, I understand that, it happened to me and it was Dante's ninth circle of hell. But the VAST MAJORITY of these smurfs, and especially the giga toxic ones that are getting banned and chain buying new accounts, are level 30 accounts with no history. Making it so that it only filters for players with no past placements solves the returning player issue while weeding out most of the smurfs (sure some will still get through but it won't be nearly as bad, and if they've previously played ranked they will be closer to their real MMR anyway). Two birds...",

The only thing they want is to squeeze the base and everything else is 2nd prio.. RP gets more expensive, passes get worse, events are mega meh, teasers/cinematics are very poor although it was one of the big things that riot did well in the past.

Why does there being 133 champions matter when majority of champions are only viable in 1 or 2 roles? Top laners aren't gonna play Nami and Milio top. Junglers aren't gonna play Sona and Jhin jungle, you legit cannot clear camps with certain champions.\n\nYour suggestion means thirty bans. That's literally more bans than there are bot laners in the game and that's including the viable mage bot laners and Yasuo. What are ADCs supposed to play if 15 ADCs get banned out? What about junglers when there's 15+ jungle bans? Are junglers supposed to know how to play 20+ champions each patch? \n\nOn top of that, you're literally just hard buffing niche one tricks by allowing them to ban out 3 counter picks while no one bans their low pick rate mains like Kled, Urgot, Tryndamere, Yorick, Qiyana, Cass, etc. \n\nOr even enchanter support mains telling their team to ban out every single tank and hook support. \n\nDid you even think about how dogshit the game when you can literally ban out almost entire class of champions or when one tricks can ban out THREE COUNTERS?\n\nAll this change does is fuck everyone who plays popular and meta champions while hard buffing people who one tricks niche picks. \n\nI'm sure Riot would be really happy about all their most popular champions being unplayable in their most popular game mode.",

I\u2019m low diamond, if I get a new account, get 80% wr on silvers/golds, but then I reach platinum, I will still play better than my opponent probably, but I will not be able to stomp games anymore, because the difference in level is not as huge as people say.

You can only control one champ - yours, so try to play your best and rise to the level that these smurfs/new accounts are playing at. In the long term, these factors will all balance out until it's just your skill determining your rank.",

It's also not just playing against smurfs that's unfun--it's that they do not care about their accounts. One fragile ego and it's over. I don't have a single game in my recent match history that has no smurfs, and more often than not it's more than one.\n\nIt's so incredibly frustrating, and Riot doesn't care.

They're average players that think an mmr reset will net them &gt;400lp.\n\nWinrates for low lvl accs are also skewed. They've gotten the bulk of their wins against new/lower lvl players.\n\nWhen it comes to climbing, there's a general mental rule 1/3 games your team wins, 1/3 games the enemy team wins, 1/3 games you made the difference. The numbers can vary person to person, but the idea is to pick out the games you were the difference maker. Then, focus on what you could've improved on.\n\nAnd as an aside, real smurfs are rarely trying their best. Their baseline is just higher than the mmr of the acc. This generally means that if you've improved enough, you'll often peak over their baseline level, catching them offguard.",

Even when ahead, they'll either extend the game forever so they can have 6 items (and eventually throw) or do very risky moves that can backfire.",

Bronzes should not be playing with silvers unless they're in promos. Silvers should not be playing with golds unless they are in fact, golds. The MMR being the same is crap nonsense. An achieved rank is a steady variable, whereas the mmr is all over the place.\n\nUltimately having to climb over a dead weight feeder in every match is just a frustrating and immensely stupid way to win or lose a game. That's what they need to change. Close the player skill gap so that players can develop their skills organically amongst their peers. I don't really care what the dev team *think* these matches look like on paper, but most of them aren't made fair.",

It takes people hundreds of games to climb 200 LP because they don't learn from their own mistakes and keep doing silver stuff. So they win a few, lose a few, win even more, then lose some more.

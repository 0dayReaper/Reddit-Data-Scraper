            "comment": "On \"letting pro players adapt\" pro players for the most part just dont adapt and personally I also dont like it when people say to slow down patching or stop patching so that pros can adapt. Again and again we see picks stick around for months to years and pros will just perpetually handshake. Personally i think that some amount of revolving door and some amount of balance team intention is necessary or teams will just play Yuumi Zeri Lucian Nami Aphelios Lulu until the heat death of the universe. Vi Wukong even got some nerfs along the way, but for months and months now pros have still not deemed any champs better in the jungle than just taking these two as top priority. We're not that far away from the multimonth Udyr Hecarim handshaking, and like 10 other handshake metas, a lot of these champs have been in the game for a decade at this point, if pros haven't learned the whole roster I dont know what to tell you.  \n\nIf the balance team hadn't intentionally sat down and tried to bring back melee supports we would see 100% ranged supports until a balance change just the same way we saw years of Nautilus vs Leona. That being said there's just some champs i prefer watching in pro, i like that Riot brings Lee Sin and Pyke and others back every once in a while if they aren't seeing enough picks. \n\nMidlane for years was just pro players handshaking Azir Viktor Syndra Corki Ori, a lot of the current midlane meta changes required midscope reworks to become any different with Azir being less probound, Ahri Neeko Annie midscopes.",

                    "comment": "Also Phreak talks about adc power during the Milio section, and a lot of the stuff he's saying is stuff that i agree with, enchanters and the systems around the game contribute to adc power at the top level. Enchanters specifically work so well with adcs, and adcs multiply so well with enchanter buffs, ardent, etc, enchanters dont work nearly as well with any other class that is currently prioritized. Ardent nerf in the same patch is good from my perspective. \n\nIve said this a bunch of times already but i really think that if you swing back towards supports who bring value through roaming and map control rather than marksman synergy, that will also swing away from priority on botlane focused compositions. \n\nPurely my opinion but i personally find support a more fun role when enchanters and supports are more peel or cc focused rather than spamming buffs, I won a boatload of games on Milio when he came out by just spamming WE on my carry and it would take 20 minutes to stack manaflow band, but its not really fun even if im 90% winrate. Stuff like Glitterlance, polymorph, milio Q, Janna tornado, Karma QW are more fun spells to me rather than pressing E on my Jinx. Max cdr E max enchanters with ardent shurelya doesn't emphasize what makes these champs cool and unique imo.",

I think this situation is created because Gragas gets really strong with mana and some levels but players don't  think he falls off. \n\nIf you look at winrate per gamelength on lolalytics (for what that stat is worth) it  only goes down for Gragas after 20 minutes. It isn't easy to pilot him in teamfights and a CDR phaserush build works insanely well in 1v1 but less so in 5v5 where Gragas can die easily and his playmaking requires clean combos. \n\nHis laning is really easy but after lane outside of 1v1 he is really difficult. Proplay midlaners is where a lot of people noticed it first imo with how invisible Gragas looked while going even. You will never look straight up bad on Gragas.\n\nMaybe he needs some more work to change this.",

                    "comment": "Hard agree. I love Orianna (favorite champ, hence the name) but she's way too \"fair\" in terms of abilities compared to all the characters she's up against. I've mostly been playing Anivia and Zoe recently because it feels like less of an uphill battle in ranked.\n\nOrianna always was a monster in coordinated teamfights - her ability to zone with the ball is huge - and if she hits her ult on someone squishy in a teamfight, they're dead because they're cc'd. Buffing the ult's damage doesn't change that - if she's hitting big ults in teamfights, she was probably winning anyway. It's a \"win more\" buff.\n\nHer weakness is literally everywhere else. Her AP ratios and base damages with a full combo are well below other burst mages like Syndra or Lux, her range is lower, her waveclear is more committal (burn w or e in lane to clear wave and you lose trades), she has no hard CC on a basic ability leaving her with low kill threat - the list goes on.\n\nInto melee assassins her range is too low to poke effectively without threat of all-in. Her gank setup and early game 2v2 is mediocre, while simultaneously being vulnerable to ganks. Her pushing power is minimal. And if they have a dash (they all do) and a brain cell (debatable), her ult might as well be a zoning tool. She can't roam against them and she can't sidelane effectively.\n\nInto other mages, she's outranged and out-traded by most. And even if you dodge and close the gap, your abilities don't have the base damages or the AP scaling to oneshot, even with this buff. So you have to do all the work of closing the gap like you're playing Annie with none of the payoff and way less consistency because all your abilities are dodgeable and fair.\n\nShe has to be a battlemage, with low cooldown basic abilities and a high-power ultimate that let her dominate teamfights, like a utility-leaning version of Cassiopeia. She can't be squishy and bursty, she's too short ranged, too low mobility, and her kit is way too fair. Trying to make her into a burst mage is both not the fantasy of the character and flawed from a kit perspective, and I really dislike this direction.",

Why did we need this mechanic in the game then? Couldn't she just be a simple enchanter with easy mechanics?\n\nSo okay, the argument can't be that Yuumi is just another simple champion like Garen or Ashe. You can't use that to defend Yuumi's attachment mechanic. We see how problematic Yuumi's attachment mechanic is in high level and pro play, and if that niche can be obtained without the mechanic, then it's hard to defend keeping it in the game. You hit a logical brick wall arguing in this manner.\n\nSo: Instead, the argument has to be that Yuumi fills a new niche for new players learning the game because of her untargetability and attachment mechanics. This is also what Phreak goes into later, but the whole first tangent about \"champions like Yuumi and Garen\" makes no sense then.\n\nPhreak just conflating two things like makes the whole position seem a bit incoherent. I don't really buy it. It also worries me deeply that he said \"lots of more other champions like Yuumi\". Does that mean Riot wants more Yuumis in the game?",

                    "comment": "Because they offer different onboarding experiences.\n\nYour entire comment seems to ignore that both can be good for new players, but for different reasons. Yuumi is good because she is a literal first time style champion, where your friend downloads League and they can be a cute cat sitting on you. They don't know how to move, or CS, or hit skillshots or why turrets are scary or when a jungler comes or what the champions do or what macro is.\n\nThey have downloaded League, and **they do not know how to play it at all**. The untargetability + attach is very important for helping those players A) not quit the game because they spent 70%+ of the game dead and they don't know why or how to improve, and B) lower the barrier to entry because now the new player on Yuumi doesn't need to add \"constantly dodge skillshots\" or \"constantly properly micro move\" right away. They can focus on looking at what other players are doing, and timing abilities, and figuring out what champions and items do.\n\nThe point of \"like Yuumi and Garen\" are that both are new player focused champions. Garen has a passive that reward you for CS'ing to help teach new players that CS'ing is good in an immediate way (since gold gain is a bit abstracted), has 0 skillshots or mana so he doesn't need to manage resources or aiming, and has a big chonky true damage execute to teach \"use your spells in a certain order, because *this* spell is better when enemies are low health\". But Garen already assumes a player has basic RTS knowledge, and he only really works for toplane.\n\nSo yes, Riot wants more Yuumis in the game in the sense they want more new player focused onboarding champions. Especially given League is an enormously complex game that gets more complex every year: Riot for longterm game health does not want new players to be slapped with \"already know X, Y, Z, and delta to even begin playing the game at a basic enough level to be able to do anything in game\". Because if players download the game and get told that, most players are going to quit to play a game that *doesn't* lock having fun behind a 10 or 20 or 100 hour grind.",

Being balanced on high elo (not pro play) is the best option since they act know what is good and what is not, how to abuse it etc. \n\nWhile balancing for majority is for casual players that dont even pay that much attention to whats strong or meta and mostly play for fun. (For example never changing runes/builds according to matchups)",

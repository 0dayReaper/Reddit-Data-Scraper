He and Meiko faces Ahn and Wink, a not so good botlane, so it should provide a confident boost if they manage to smash them.\n\nUzi also becomes the oldest adc to ever play in LPL at 26\n\nUnrelated note, FPX benches the paycheck stealer H4cker (finally) and replaces him with faceless Bonnie.",

I have a similar wrist injury like a lot of pros develop, and the same mobility just isnt there. It locks up your fingers, your wrist, it feels like a spider web pully everything together, and when it gets really bad will lovk your hand in your playing position and hurts like a bitch. \n\nIts so hard to grind to be at your best mechancially when trying to manage that kind of injury. And the League schedule, especially in china and korea, is so grueling.",

Had the highest DPM during those 9 games even in more losses than wins, 4.5 KDA and 30% dmg dealt in the team which was enough to be 4th in the region. He also had 2nd highest KP. So sure you can focus on only the negatives like maybe he died a little too much and having more losses than wins is bad but his overall stats were pretty good considering how long he was away for and low amount of scrims.",

Gone are the days where you could play protect the puppy and reliably expect your adc to win through hands diff.

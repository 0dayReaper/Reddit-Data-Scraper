Nobody in Hong Kong trust the law system in China and in fact few years ago somebody was actually \"Bought\" to China from Hong Kong, which amplified the worrisome of businessman in Hong Kong. I can share you some news about some businessman critize the law publicly if you want.\n\nIt also damage the reputation of Hong Kong as a \"International city\". The reason Hong Kong is a international city is because Hong Kong have a well established law system inherited from UK, that's why Hong Kong can serve as a window for foreign companies to invest in China (70% of China's foreign investments are from Hong Kong.

They say they're hands off and just investing, and that's mostly the case (mobile ports of LoL aside).\n\nBlizzard made the move they did because they don't want to alienate the Chinese market, not because Tencent owns 5% of the company.",

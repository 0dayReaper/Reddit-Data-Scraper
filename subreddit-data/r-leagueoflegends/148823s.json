    "postText": "Right now, dodging is effectively a get out of jail free card for bad decisions, which is why it's being exploited so heavily the higher level you get.\n\nThe more people play to expectations of their champs / comp, the easier it is to predict how a draft will turn out and affect your chances of winning.\n\nSo the fact that you can simply leave, after you've made bad draft decisions makes no sense. It's  equivalent to being able to just leave the game after giving up first blood. Or right before you lose, even. Although to a lesser degree, but the game has already started - that's a fact\n\nMy suggestion is to subtract actual MMR from the person who dodges, and divide the amount lost evenly to the opposing team. \n\nFor instance dodger loses 5 (I don't know what number is appropriate), opposing team gains 1 each. Something in that order. The goal is mainly to deter people from dodging, while keeping rating net zero.\n\nIt could also be an option to introduce a surrender vote in draft, with a similar tiny amount of rating lost / gained\n\nLet me know what you think\n\nI know this isn't innovative, I'm sure riot has already brainstormed this and thought about why / not, but in terms of ranked integrity it seems, to me, the only way to get rid of dodging as a way to gain rating. Right now dodging is \"gameplay\" the way it's designed, and I'm 100% sure that doesn't go under good gameplay design in Riot's opinion.",

That's the whole idea - it's to make you not dodge, and play those games out. The chances of winning are a lot closer to 50/50 than what you'd think.\n\nThat is, unless you're in high elo where drafts start to matter, and the game becomes more predictable. It would also incentivise drafting better in those elos",

Moreover, games in low elo will mostly go on as they are, because people dodge far less there\n\nI'm also not really sure what your point is?",

Then subtract it immediately at the point the season ends. So if you dodged a lot, you might drop out of Challenger etc.",

All you've done is make those gains slightly less.  It's still strictly speaking the correct move to dodge if you are trying to grind.\n\nIf you want to make it an actual loss then the amount you lose from dodging needs to actually equate to more than the amount of time you save and convert into more chances to win.",

People dodge because they have terrible drafts, autofills, bad teammates, etc.  The chance of winning is lower than 50%.\n\nYou also aren\u2019t factoring in time.  Being stuck in that loss at least until an ff vote passes is time that you are not spending queuing for a winning game or in a winning game.\n\nAnd, it\u2019s also mental that you are preserving.  Even if you aren\u2019t getting tilted in that bad game, it\u2019s still mental energy you are saving to spend more effectively on a better game.",

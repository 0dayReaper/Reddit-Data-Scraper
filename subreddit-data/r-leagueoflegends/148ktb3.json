I will point out that I do have someone with an approximately equal rank on my team for matches I play against higher elo players, so mileage may very.\n\nPlaying norms against plats and low diamonds feels very playable in lane. With gold duo playing against high plat doesn\u2019t feel too different, definite difference in micro though. \n\nHigh diamond is where the stomps happen much more consistently, but not all the time. I\u2019d say this is the cut off for me.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the masters players just take it easy in norms since they always play casually and off role, but I\u2019m sure they would be much more consistent than diamond if serious. Whenever masters friend plays seriously it\u2019s pretty fucking brutal, micro, macro, game sense all significantly better. \n\nNever matched against chally in norms lol.",

I've found the following:\n\nBronce 1- Silver 1 it's easy for me to carry every game, I'm talking 25+ kills and even some games with 35-38 while dying 2-3 times. This is the ELO I play in with my gf. I've found I'm able to carry 2 inting teammates 0/9+ score kind of stuff, but never 3, the game becomes unwinnable no mater how fed I am. \n\nGold 4-1- (testing on a new account) I've gone 4-0 so far. Finished all games with 15+ kills and less than 5 deaths.",

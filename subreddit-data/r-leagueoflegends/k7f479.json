I can always stun e out if he tries to all in me so he can\u2019t kill me and I also can\u2019t kill him unless he doesn\u2019t utilize his passive but its just not a fun matchup.

You can definitely find generals that lost because they did something completely boneheaded.  However, you can also find generals that spent so much time jumping at shadows that they failed to act when they needed to or who came up with an extremely complex plan that collapsed under its own weight.",

He had vision of him for over a second where garen just chills next to the wall. Even if you still assume he has flash, you aren't going to completely run away before you see him flash, or else like we saw he will just walk away. Also he would've dealt extra damage to him and possibly force him out of the lane even if he flashes.\n\nI really don't know how anyone would read this as a \"this is a good player being faked\". The only situation in which you back off is if you think the enemy jungler/mid can be there. However he sees all enemies on the map and they are running away. 100% epic fail.",

The awareness to assume that he's going to flash just says a lot to me about this player, because bad players always assume there is no flash. So to just leave without seeing it tells me that the player is actively thinking about the other guy flashing which says to me that he's probably not a terrible player. It's very simple.",

Since they'd just keep chasing without even considering that something might be a problem. \n\nThis is probably Silver gameplay. Smart enough to care about flash but not smart enough to actually use that consideration properly.",

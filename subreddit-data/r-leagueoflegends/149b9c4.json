    "postText": "In some games i heard the voiceline \"I am infinite\" sounding almost like a shadow isle champ or a project skin. As it seemed to appear at random, i can't pinpoint it to a certain champ or skin.\n\nNot the best example but you can hear it here: [https://youtu.be/5m6nfZjuVyo?t=576](https://youtu.be/5m6nfZjuVyo?t=576)  \n\n\nAs it's neither illaoi, nor irelia, it does seem like a global voiceline.  \n\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

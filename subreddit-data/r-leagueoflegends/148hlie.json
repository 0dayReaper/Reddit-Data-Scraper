    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been getting back into league, I am plat 4 0lp. I am constantly getting diamond+ on the enemy team while I am getting silvers. I know normal matchmaking probably doesn\u2019t use rank but this is ridiculous, I\u2019m getting curb stomped by some of these players and it feels like they just get a free win because of matchmaking. Seriously am I just super biased or something? Like I had a game with 2 challengers on the enemy team, we were all plat 4 and we got obliterated.",

Recently I have been wanting to play again to see if I can hit diamond which I have hit before and I won 4 straight and was one win away from plat 3 and then went on a 5 game losing streak which normally I would stop playing but I saw my demotion shield was orange so I was like might as well give it one more game. Big mistake. Lost that game getting an S+ and demoted. Which shocked me because I thought the demotion shield thing had to be red before demotion. And ever since then I've been on a downward spiral through gold even though I play really well every game. I don't belong in gold. /rant",

Like match the master mid laners with each other and let the bronze people bot enjoy their game without getting their teeth kicked in. I know it will take more queue time but I'd rather have that then spent 15 minutes away from exp and farm because enemy top laner is grandmaster and knows how to put you out of the game beyond recovery. Which in a sense the guy has to do, knowing his bot or mid lane has the reverse situation.",

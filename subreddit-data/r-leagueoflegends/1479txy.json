    "postText": "title; every game I try tpo go on a lane to catcha  break from the stress and responsibilities of jungle.   \nLiterally 80% of my games as a laner are lost because either the jungler refuses to gank and powerfarms and only does one drake, whilst letting 1-2-3 lanes feed without giving them a chance to fight back and hopefully somehow scale and potentially carry, or they just gank (fail or not it doesn't last for long) while ignoring any objective and then ultimately loosing becaue too many buffs on enemies became the deciding factor in fights.  \nI've got a stable 60% winrate on jungle because I'm prioritising drakes/barons, and ganking when I can or when someone gets a lead, and if there's tons of gank space, and I usually make my team get pretty buff, leaving most of the kills if I don't need to step in and confirm the kill, but all I see on 80% of every other jungler in my team is: getting mad at people feeding (regardless of counterpick), ignoring drakes, not ganking alost at all, resulting in more than one lane feeding and that causing a steamroll for the enemy team, and just losing regardless of most of my efforts as....anything.  \nFor example I had a game where I went aatrox vs shen, yi jg, lee sin as enemy jungle. game starts, lee sin ganks twice in the first 5 minutes, then literally sits in one of his bushes for almost two whole minutes. I start pinging my yi to take advantage and powerfarm like an animal or invade, or do drake, he ignores it and tries to gank, then goes to do drake, while at the same level with lee sin, who was barely getting xp from shen's lane (shared too), then goes back to powerfarm, and in 1-2 minutes is back on the same level with yi, fast forward we lose because almost-steamroll and all objectives but the first drake (only took because I spammed pings for yi to take it) are already gone, and we almost all fed while lee kept ganking and relying on the kill xp and the extrmeely small shared minion xp to stay in line with yi? and it worked, lol.  \nso, what can I even do?",

I keep pinging whoever has too many wards with little vision, ask for them to put vision down (esp bot and top) when free wards or generally, just so that they know they get ganked, and so that they have time to prepare and get distance, but yes you are right lol, it's most of the situations too.",

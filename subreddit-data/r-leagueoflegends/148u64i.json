She was honestly pretty balanced winrate rise but if anything she was/is op because of the insane amount of healing she does*\n\n(Also people complained about her Jax E but that also wasn\u2019t a big factor. It\u2019s definitely a good ability but not game breaking)\n\nThere\u2019s prolly more examples of champs before 2021 getting this reaction but these are just the ones that popped up in my head immediately.",

Everything can be translated, but some meaning is always lost, just as meaning is lost when trying to speak in the first place / language is an imperfect medium.\n\nSome things lose more meaning than others, however, and I would argue this is present especially so in common phrases like \"itadakimasu\". Whereas basic concepts like movement/sight can generally be translated relatively literally with a little inclusion of context, phrases like \"itadakimasu\" don't have individual parts like \"thank you\" included in them despite their inclusion in the translation. As I understand it, \"itadakimasu\" is a polite conjugation \u9802\u304f(itadaku), a verb meaning to receive / eat. This however would not make much sense translated literally, hence the need for a more complex phrase. However, because there is not a simple, direct translation and the phrase has significant meanings specific to usage within the language, \"itadakimasu\" can be much more complex to translate.",

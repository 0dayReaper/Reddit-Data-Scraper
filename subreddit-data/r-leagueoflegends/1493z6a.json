    "postText": "EDG (1-3) beats IG (1-3) in Game 1. This game shows the return of the prestigious and beloved ADC Uzi. Amazing performance by Uzi as he gets acclimated to the pro scene again. He showed some nerves but great laning, positioning, and team fighting by him. Also, iG debuts Wen in the top lane and starts Beishang who was from WE.",

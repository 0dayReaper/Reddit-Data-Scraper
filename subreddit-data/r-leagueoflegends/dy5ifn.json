LoL is super popular and one of my friends asked me to play with him since he knew I've been playing for way longer.\n\nHe got me a bronze I acct and wanted to duo with me. When we got in our lobby and a guy called jungle before my chat even loaded. When it was his turn to choose he locked Lee so fast I thought he had the champ locked the whole time.\n\nWhen we got in game everything went normally for about a minute 50. Then with red buff in tow, he came to gank my top lane, that I'm barely managing to push in as renekton against a panth. Before the wave even collapsed, this mofo does the smoothiest ward hop -&gt; Q I've seen my whole life, and slams his level 2 body into panth, instantly getting stunned and with his whole ass 400 hp, giving away red for free.\n\nFrom that moment on I knew there are these chinese guys with god tier mechanics for lee andthe decision making ability of a fucking potato.",

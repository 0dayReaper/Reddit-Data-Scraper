    "postText": "And I hope she won\u2019t get nerfed into the ground in that position. \n\nThis post is more an appreciation post for riots recent trend of allowing all kinds of champions to (somewhat) thrive in the jungle, with Rell being a huge improvement to my enjoyment of that champion. \n\nWhen Rell first came out I thought she was really cool, as a long time Leona main who doesn\u2019t really vibe with any other engage tanks, it was nice to have someone to add to my roster in case Leona was banned, however, Rell wouldn\u2019t fill that spot. I found that once she did her combo, she didn\u2019t really do much for the rest of the fight, feeling a little underwhelming to my usual playstyle. I didn\u2019t mind her lack of damage, in fact, for the longest time I kept hoping a champion would be released that relied on constant CC and high bulk rather than damage to be a sufficient threat. \n\nWhen I first saw the changes and tried them in training, I didn\u2019t like them. She felt so much more clunky then before. But then, seeing all the buffs to jungle damage, jumped into a game to play her in that role. \n\nI have not had so much fun in the jungle in a while. Sure, I had played Leona jungle with multiple builds even before jungling became easier, but Rell is so distinctly different now. Her E allowing allies to catch up to your gank, the ranged stun into guaranteed knockup or the other way around so people flashing away can still be caught if you play it well, it felt great!\n\nI\u2019ve always been a fan of off meta, playing champions in silly ways and positions and with the runes and items updates always felt like that was way more of a detriment than it used to be. \n\nBut Rell kinda rekindled that, and I greatly enjoy using her in the jungle. Her coming changes seem more than fair and her Q cast time reduction might just be the thing she needs to feel smooth to play again. \n\nTl,dr: Off meta fun, Rell good, please keep Rell as an able jungler, thanks, an idiot.",

                            "comment": "The rework butchered her early strength, team fight sustain, ally peel, Q utility, and W range, damage, and speed. And in return, we got an ability almost exclusively useful for junglers. \n\nThe weaker passive means even if you hit your full combo, you get less tank shred than just an auto in lane. The inability to reset the duration also means the enemy can just ignore you after you engage until your stats drop off, which they couldn't do when you could elongate the steal previously. That, plus the removal of the hugs missing health heal makes you so much squishier in teamfights. The lost E removes most of your ability to cover allies, as the tank stats and heal are gone. The slower, shorter, weaker W1 is almost impossible to land now without initiating with Q, so you can no longer hold Q for shield break and lose masses of effective damage and utility because of it. On the topic of the Q, it's now shorter and slower to cast making it even worse than it was before, and that's not even mentioning the loss of heal to make poke lanes safer. W's passives have been gutted. Losing the early mounted movement speed to the new E (which is weaker than old W passive) makes her so much more clunky, and the added range and attack speed while dismounted is inconsequential with how much weaker the passive is now, to the point autoing to proc it isn't worth doing. \n\nAnd all we got as compensation was the ability to clear camps; something that shouldn't be a priority for a support champion, which Riot stated would be the focus of her rework. The new E is exclusively useful for camp clears and gank assist. \n\nLiterally everything but the ult (the only thing that wasn't changed) is now worse, less useful, and less fun for support.",

If they \u201cbutchered\u201d it like you say they did her wr would be horrendous but its better than it was before. Also you land your w with r, isn\u2019t that like the basics? Its not really harder to land unless you\u2019re raw doggin it. Think you\u2019re just playin it wrong.",

You HAVE to initiate with Q now to set up W, which means you can't hold Q for the shield break, which, combined with the heal we've also lost, was one of the strongest aspect of her kit if you used it right. W R engages also suffer because of the shorter W range, admittedly less so, but if you're exclusively holding off for W R engages, what are you doing for the first 5 levels?\n\nAnd she HAS lost WR. Just looking at support she's gone from 51.7% pre rework, to 50.6&amp; on live. And even outside of the fact she's been statistically nerfed, she's just no where near as fun to play anymore with her big impactful breakpoints being removed and high impact engages being neutered. And all that was compensated with nothing for support players.",

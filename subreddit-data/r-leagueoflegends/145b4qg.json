Usually bugs that benefit you, you are not allowed to use, and bugs thay disadvantage you, you can use but you don't get to complain if they happen, as you signed up for it.\n\nThe list is usually not that long, doesn't change that much, and most bugs are incredibly niche scenarios. Something like shiv being disabled would 100% be talked about, and accounted for in draft. Either the player didn't know, which is a failure from himself/coaching/supporting staff, or he just made a simple mistake ingame.\n\nObviously this is a sad solution by riot to make a decision that effectively decides the game, and I wish there was a solution like manually disable the item, spot it earlier, or rewind. I could also see a world where rewinding the game could be abused by a player to gain huge ingame info as the game state had progressed, and thus I'm not sure if there's a better decision they could have made once it had happened, unless they have the tools to manually refund the item at no cost, which I don't think they do.\n\nTldr: riot could have a better long term solution, but I don't think they made a bad call for this game.",

BRO and another team had to play with 4-5 players from academy and got stomped. Then suddenly the rules were changed to \"if the covid-positive player feels ok they can play from isolation\".\n\nSummer 2022 T1's jungle Oner had a bug on his smite wher the cooldown was lower, Oner repeteadly told the referee about the bug and was told it was ok. At min 13-14 when the enemy saw Oner's smite upgraded (impossible due to 5-uses of smite mechanic of season 12) and stopped the game.

IDK how known the bug is or when it got added to the list but if hes been playing with shiv from the start of the patch and they don't check for the bug/still buy shiv in scrims it isn't that weird that he would have muscle memory on it already. Also I haven't followed super closely but it wouldn't surprise me to hear that Aiming (and most pros) just didn't know the bug existed. Riot is supposed to tell the teams and players but I seriously doubt the players are paying that much attention to item bans.",

Sometimes several. \n\nOff the top of my head: \n\nBaseball this year alone added a pitch clock, the Ohtani rule, bigger bases and shift limitations for the defense. \n\nThe NFL changes what\u2019s considered legal for defenders all the time (part of why most scoring/passing records have all been broken in the last 20 years), as well as patches abuse cases in the rules from the previous season almost every year. \n\nThe CFL even added some weird ass eligibility rules that teams are abusing the fuck out of and listing their best players ad \u201cback ups\u201d and not having them play until the 2nd play of the game to skirt roster limitations for non-Canadians for \u201cstarters.\u201d\n\nThe NBA has tried to start cracking down on guys drawing fouls when shooting the last few years by specifying that if the shooter is the one who initiates contact for any reason other than to take a legitimate shot attempt they should be called for a foul. Though since it\u2019s dependant on the refs that\u2019s been a mixed bag. \n\nThe NHL added for this season the ability to review a major penalty on replay and rescind it altogether if it\u2019s found to not be a penalty. Last year I think they had some sort of rule change for what penalties could be assessed on a dangerous cross check. \n\nAgain, those are just off the top of my head, and I barely watch any of those other than baseball most of the year, so I\u2019m sure someone else could chime in and list more examples, but it\u2019s just untrue to say real sports don\u2019t change their rules.",

Is it not their jobs to observe the game in real time and make calls when they spot something off? Yes it's a dumb mistake but are the refs just sitting there looking pretty or what? It's embarrassing it took so long. And why isn't the item disabled in the client? Allegedly the bug only happens when Renata is in the game and we don't have the specific rulebook. They said the rulebook could be more clear so it's possible they interpreted it as ONLY when Renata is in the game. Riot Korea is notorious for these situations already so I'm not going to assign the FULL blame to just Aiming.",

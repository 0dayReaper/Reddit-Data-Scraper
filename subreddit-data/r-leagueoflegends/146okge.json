Have to draft better, like LPL teams were beating up LCK teams that picked annie with maokai and mid jayce. It's not something new. \n\nI'm fine with drafts like game 1 where it fucks with the opponent's plans. Game 2 was ezreal sucked hard so whatever we learnt the lesson. \n\nBut game 3? Thats a self counter draft that basically goes \"deft please play perfectly and we can win late game because most of our champs can't do shit into DRX's comp midgame\"\n\nthat's a frustrating draft.",

Yes we could win easier with a better comps but now we are looking stronger because we won against a winning comps. Last year we would lose this game if you remember.\n\nAnd those weird picks what makes DK so strong against any other team because you have no idea what they will play that day.\n\nSo we should just let them cook and learn and improve. I\u2018m sure if they play like this they will be very scary toward the playoffs.",

Showmaker had to split his attention between shotcalling and laning/carrying. You see it in their lack of vision control and mid/late game decisions are wonky ever since their shotcallers left the team.  \n\n\nTheir early game is still ridiculously strong and if they often get a lead they can extend it, but right now in the game there's too many comeback mechanics and for any team lose a teamfight post 20 minutes and you can lose the game. DK gets a bit sloppy",

I think DRX can actually play the game with him other than with Pleata who just AFKs laning phase and hopes for the best\n* Again, Paduck is crazy good. He almost hit every Varus Q and his Zeri in Game 2 was phenomenal\n* Rascal tries his best and it shows. He will probably continue to 2v8 together with Paduck\n* Please move Juhan to the starting roster. Croco showed form in the games today, but it's not enough to justify not benching him. We will probably see where the future will get him\n* It's hard to say if kyeahoo or FATE are better because they both do absolutely nothing. Sure, the meta is focused on Botlane, but Showmaker and Faker just did so much more today... all in all i think they are about equally good\n* Beryl NEEDS TO STOP RUNNING IT DOWN. It was fun in spring season but now it's just bothering me. Paduck has so much potential, but he's dragged down by someone who treats these games as flex queue games. His Ashe in Game 3 was brutally bad. No Arrows, no Laning, no Team Fight value. I'm still giving him the benefit of a doubt, but please pick something that actually fits the comp you're playing in...\n* If DRX continues this upwards trend, they have a legit chance for playoffs and even Worlds... PLEASE MAKE THAT HAPPEN :((((((\n* D+ looks like a fucking trainwreck. Solid roster on paper but they just don't click. Deft is in his peak form however, probably the one straw D+ is holding on right now. Sucks for him to not be in a better team...",

It doesn't matter that 4 people end up reporting them, they just keep on doing the same until they get into a game.\n\nI'm not even talking about the support singed players who *might* be trying to win, I'm talking about those who literally declare that they are going to run it down. But no - people saying mean things ingame is a much bigger problem!!!\n\nYou can't even send a ticket to riot because they hide names in champ select now... That would at least give you something to do in the 6 minutes of downtime you get from dodging.",

Effort Riot is clearly unwilling to undertake. I mean, you can still circumvent the word filter by slight misspellings, like using \"@\" instead of \"a\". In 2023. It's clearly the lowest amount of manpower and money spent possible.",

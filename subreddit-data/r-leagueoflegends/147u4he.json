    "postText": "I'll TL;DR for people at the bottom.\n\nSo in patch 13.12 I noticed this is being changed, and I feel it needs to be addressed.\n\nDuskblade of Draktharr\n\n* Bug fix for Samira \\[R\\] **Inferno Trigger** and Katarina \\[R\\] **Death Lotus**\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know why this is here Duskblade makes a champion untargetable after a kill. If Katarina or Samira got a kill during their ult then they would be un-targetable for the rest of the ult, which is obviously very powerful. Even though they are dealing damage they stay untargetable and cant be cc'd.\n\nI have 2 big concerns with this change\n\n1. Riot is classifying this a \"bug fix\" which as far as I can tell it isn't. (I'll explain below)\n2. Kat and Samira are not the only champions who can channel while un-targetable so why is it just them being changed and not the item itself. (Again I'll explain)\n\n1.Duskblade makes a champion un-targetable until they perform an action that breaks stealth. The only actions that break stealth are A**uto attacking** or **Casting a spell** (also recalling and summoner spells but those don't matter here). Both Kat and Samira are channeling an ability. They are not **auto attacking** or **casting a spell.** You could make an argument they channeling an ability is casting a spell but again that would be incorrect. The spell has already been cast and is being channeled. So calling this a bug fix is just incorrect. That's why they were able to do this in the first place. Duskblade DOES NOT break untargetable when the champion deals damage. We would have noticed that on any champ with a dot, or sunfire, or any kind of damage they deal passively. **The item is currently working as intended**\n\n2. There's not many champs in the game that regularly buy Duskblade AND have a channeled ability but that doesn't mean they don't exist. It might not be the most optimal mythic but I'll give a few examples of champs that could build Duskblade.\n\n* Lucian R\n* Miss Fortune R\n* Warwick R (unsure if his R counts as **auto attacking** for this)\n* Garen W spin (technically not a channel but it still has the same interaction)\n\nNow again most of these champs wont build Duskblade, but just because it isn't popular doesn't mean it shouldn't be addressed, especially if this is being called a bug fix. It's not at all a unique interaction to kat or samira so again I find it strange why is it just them being changed. In patch 13.12 if lucian is still able to duskblade while ulting and kat/samira cant then that's just inconsistent.\n\nAs far as I can tell what happened is the duskblade change just benefited them positively which.....isnt a bug. We're not calling Helia Ashe a bug just because it's a crazy interaction. We're not saying Rocketbelt Neeko is a bug just because its a good item on her. So why are we calling this a bug when its just a good item on them.\n\nGranted its more of a off meta build for Kat but it's absolutely strong on Samira. I have no problem with it being nerfed or adjusted in fact I dont even play samira. I just think this is a strange case of an interaction being correct and for some reason it's being treated as a bug. If duskblade is being changed to get interrupted on channels I have no problem with that but then why wasnt it noted in the patch notes. Why is it listed as specifically a Katarina and Samira change\n\nApologies for rambling on I just found this very strange and I hope I explained the interaction well enough.\n\n**TL;DR** Duskblade interaction on Kat/Samira is NOT a bug and is working as intended. It's only being changed because its a strong item choice which is then not a big fix. I have no problem nerfing them but then classify it as such or change the item not the individual champions.",

The only issue is that she has 0 survivability with that, and Duskblade *kinda* solved that issue. It also does have higher winrate on both 1st and 2nd item compared to Infinity Edge. Honestly IE is just bad, it's a tragedy they changed it into mythic.\n\nYou might think \"then why don't just build Collector into Shieldbow into IE\" or \"Shieldbow into IE\" or something like that - the answer is really simple! The shield is fucking **pitiful**, it gives 215 shield until like level 14. \n\nIt's literally nothing compared to what it was before, plus the item doesn't give any attack speed and the bonus attack speed that comes from procing shield is like 20 times worse than AD it was giving before. Apart from that, before it had hp from mythic passive, now it has nothing.\n\nSo - she can go IE, but with that she's even more of a coinflip and ultimate snowball champion that she was before, either killing everyone instantly or she dies trying, where before item change, it wasn't *that* bad. Plus, even though items before suited her way more, she wasn't that strong anyway.\n\nShe's getting buffed 100% before her mythic skin comes out.\n\nSamira was a champion that was utterly balanced around Shieldbow being a mythic. After it changed, she got fucked in the ass with 0 compensation (for now at least).",

I highly doubt any reports against him are going to simply be passed through an automated system alone considering how high-profile he is.",

Riot Sanjuro was a Lead Experience Designer, so powerful and so wise he could use Riot to influence the player experience to reduce toxicity\u2026 He had such a knowledge of toxicity that he could even keep the ones he cared about from being toxic. The Experience Design Department of Riot is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he had succumbed to toxicity on the /r/Leagueoflegends, then they called him out his hypocrisy. Ironic. He could save others from toxicity, but not himself.",

It's the reason he's reliably #1 in numbers, he doesn't have any real competition from ~7am to 5pm EST when he usually streams.\n\nIf you're trying to stream after 6pm you're competing with probably 5-10 pros and 5+ professional streamers. Tyler1 may end up beating the other people at that slot but there's no way he beats QT's numbers.\n\nThat's honestly a huge part of QT's success - his streaming schedule. Not only does he have the lowest competition time slot but he's been streaming during that time slot for half a decade. \n\nQuite frankly I'm not even other streamers are in the same league as QT. He's honestly closer to being a morning show host than he is a streamer, there's a reason for his success.\n\nHe's a good example of what kind of effort and passion it takes to find real success in gaming. Dude works hard. Tyler1 is actually one of the few people I would say I've seen put forth a similar level of effort into streaming (Trick2g is another). Tyler may do very well in his slot, but QT will always own the morning and thus the raw viewership.",

Out of all people given this penalty, only 2 have ever been unbanned (Incarnati0n/Jensen and now Tyler1). To get unbanned, you have to go through a very rigorous review process and have to kind of work with Riot almost everyday. Tyler1 is a popular streamer, even after he got banned; he would stream other games and IRL.  But his love and passion for video games all lie in League of Legends, so he worked incredibly hard to change his behavior and in the end, it paid off, he's finally unbanned.  I expect the first stream he comes back, he'll get at least 100,000 concurrent viewers. ",

He is overly passionate about this game and being one of the best. I\u2019ve watched him countless times reach masters and almost challenger within such short periods of time (due to streaming) which is insane to me. I know there are some people out there who still don\u2019t think he deserves to be unbanned but give credit where credit is due. For months he has held his composure and proved to everyone he can play the game without flaming. This game (imo) can be really fucking stupid and frustrating but yet tyler still held through and showed all of you that he really WANTS this and he is reformed. I\u2019m excited to watch him grow off of something he loves now and I hope you are as well ",

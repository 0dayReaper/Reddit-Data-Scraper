I know there\u2019s a lot of these on this subreddit but I would really appreciate it if you could take one minute to fill out this survey for me (it\u2019s mostly multiple choice so you can quickly do it on your phones too).  \nHere\u2019s the link: [https://efb15pudbt9.typeform.com/to/XVqySaQy](https://efb15pudbt9.typeform.com/to/XVqySaQy)\n\nI\u2019m building a League of Legends app and your feedback will greatly help me understand some of your needs as players and ultimately shape and improve the app for all of us.\n\nThank you for your help!",

I want to have players focus on their weaknesses and improve those weaker aspects of their gameplay. Apps that currently exist on the market do offer different types of performance tracking but none of them offer a way for players to train. Similarly to aim trainers for FPS games, League needs an app that will allow players to practice. Right now I'm trying to understand which features players will value the most, why everyone plays LoL, etc.",

That game had both the worse laning from summer and a lot of weird decisions from him similar to spring. \n\nStill really enjoy watching him because I think his insane spacing in lane together with always playing for pressure will lead to exciting games no matter what.",

League is a team game, Rookie's been good domestically, internationally, in the clutch, in pretty much every meta, basically had the perfect career individually, the worlds argument would work for Faker if he wasn't on stacked teams on all those years.",

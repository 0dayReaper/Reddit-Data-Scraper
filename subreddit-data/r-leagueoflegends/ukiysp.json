    "postText": "https://twitter.com/Biofrostlol/status/1522999710751076352/photo/1\n\n&gt; I'm gay. I've struggled with my personal identity my entire life. While my parents were working in China, I moved around a lot from homestay to homestay, which is basically where you live in a stranger's home. At the age of 8, I was bombarded with homophobic and sexist remarks at home, and whenever I did something that wasn't \"manly,\" I was told, \"Why are you acting like a girl?\" and to stop being \"gay.\" I was hyper-conscious of how I should act and tried not to act or sound \"gay,\" but I was still constantly bullied at school for it. No child should have to feel like they don't belong. Working in the video game industry hasn't helped matters either. On almost every team I've been on, I've heard homophobic comments from either my teammates or the staff and felt uncomfortable, even borderline afraid of possibly losing my job if I told the truth. I'm at a point in my life where I've accepted who I am, and it's taken me a long time to get there. My story is not unique. The gaming industry is rampant with sexism, prejudice, and homophobia. I don't believe there's a quick fix, but it starts with us holding ourselves to a higher standard and treating everyone with dignity. We need to educate people in esports of proper conduct within the workplace. I'm not making this announcement because I owe everyone the details of my personal life, but because I want there to be more awareness about the problems our community faces. Thank you to my parents and friends who have made me feel like I belong. You the real ones.",

I like many, repressed my identity as trans since I was little hoping that im just a feminine man, then accepted myself as a feminine gay man then finally coming out to myself. Awareness prevents people spending their lives feeling miserable and depressed because they dont know who they are anymore, its a horrible thing no one should have to experience. Im lucky that I realised im trans at 20 but many others arent as fortunate as me and spend the majority fo their life wonderinf why they are so depressed, dissatisfied and uninterested in everything before realising it all.",

Everyone always joked about \"When are you coming out of the closet?!\", \"Dating a girl?! I always thought you were gay, LOL.\", \"Bro, don't be such a f**.\" Then because I didn't feel manly like other guys it made me wonder if I really am gay, and that I should NEVER share that with anyone because it would prove everyone right (which means they convinced me it is a bad thing, when it's not). Then I realized I do not give a fuck even if they think I am. I will embrace my feminine side because that balance of manly vs. feminine isn't even real! It not about the manly side or the feminine side, it's all the human side. The spectrum of personality. Who I am as a person. So even I, someone who really has next to nothing to worry about when it comes to prejudice, spent the first 25 years of my life putting a mask on infront of others because I felt I had to be manly. Then I met my now wife, and she just accepted me for being a huge \"cute\" weirdo, and wanting to be overtly cuddly. I'm into butch girls.\n\nThis type of mentality hurts everyone, and I call it out every chance I get because it's simply not right, especially in the age of information. I'm sorry you and so many others have to hide or at the least endure such gross attitudes and cultural norms.\n\nDisappointed the teams didn't even understand it, but glad Biofrost is no longer afraid. The less fear, the less perpetrators can get away with, thus slowly ending the cycle for the future generations.",

I wouldn\u2019t automatically lump all people who used those terms in the category of homophobic or sexist, unless they refuse to acknowledge that those things were wrong. For sure people have better awareness and sensitivity to those things which is why I have no doubt that many of the pro players who used to say \u201cgay\u201d and \u201crape\u201d in those contexts now cringe and refute that terminology.",

In the interior of the states, people tend to be more conservative, so it must be very difficult to be openly gay in these places. In the state capitals (and big cities), things tend to be easier.\n\nI would say that things are evolving positively fast, even with an idiot like Bolsonaro in power. Things were much worse 10 years ago. Obviously we need to improve more, but... All countries need to keep evolving in this sense.\n\nA surprise for people outside Brazil is that the Brazilian LoL community is probably the most gay and female friendly among all games. There are some reasons why this happened, it is not an immediate reflection of the Brazilian society, anyway...",

And when following the TSM roster (still my favourite roster ever), I always felt a strong kinship to Vincent, not because I knew of his sexuality, but because I really saw a lot of myself in him. And it\u2019s so incredibly meaningful to me that he came out. I\u2019m fortunate to have supportive parents and friends so I\u2019m able to come out. And I\u2019m sure Vincent\u2019s story will help even more those kids who don\u2019t feel as supported or represented, to feel more comfortable with themselves, and not feel as alone. \n\nOne of my favourite quotes says \"Every time someone steps up and says who they are, the world becomes a better, more interesting place.\" Vincent probably won\u2019t see this, but I really want to say \u201cthank you\u201d. Thank you for being so brave and honest. Thank you for making it easier for kids like us. Thank you for making the world a better, and more interesting place. Thank you and so so much love \u2764\ufe0f",

I'm sure there are a number of other gay people in the league scene (as in other sports) who haven't come out because of fear of repercussions from owners, team members, and fans.  Glad he's being part of positive change and hope the community strongly supports him.",

Gay again.  \n\n\nI had to really look myself in the mirror when I was 18 and my younger brother came out to me as gay. I had to reevaluate everything that was ingrained in me by my upbringing and generally being an idiot. It's crazy to me now, in my 30s, that I lived like that for so long, allowing myself to behave like that. I wish, looking back, that I hadn't fallen into that social trap with my friends where gay was the word we used. I never knew at the time what I was really probably doing for someone else.",

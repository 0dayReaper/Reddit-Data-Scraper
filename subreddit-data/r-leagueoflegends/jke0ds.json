I am not saying you cannot learn to do what she is doing or that she is uniquely talented; I am just saying it is proven some people are better than others in various stuff.\n\nCase in point : Vo2max, you can train your vo2max up 5-15% but if your vo2max is shite to start with, you will still be miles behind to some newbie with great Vo2Max to start with...\n\n&gt;Now, back to our depressing revelation: There\u2019s only 5-15% potential improvement. Not a whole lot of wiggle room there. If you come into the lab and I test you as having a VO2 **max of 50 ml/kg/min, the best you can hope for with \u201call the training in the world\u201d is an improvement to ~57 ml/kg/min**. With world-class males typically scoring 75-85 ml/kg/min and world-class females scoring 65-75 ml/kg/min, an improvement from 50 to 57 isn\u2019t going to put you in sight of winning most local races, let alone validate your dream of winning a big one!\n\n[Sauce](https://simplifaster.com/articles/how-trainable-is-vo2-max/)",

Also Vo2 max alone isn't a good predictor for a lot of athletic events, for example long distance cycling events, most of the top athletes have a less than amazing Vo2 max, where as something like cross country skiing you'd typically see individuals having the highest level Vo2 maxs.\n\nYes some people are just better than others at some things, a good example would be muscle fibre distribution for long distance and sprint performance. But usually its only the very best in the world who've got the natural talent + training, but talent without training will never outperform someone with mediocre levels of talent but a lot of optimised training.",

There are tons of skills out there that get chalked up to talent like what we see in the video when really nothing they were born with likely contributed to their ability besides being born a functioning human being.\n\nThe one that I agree with \"talent\" having a role in is sports and similar activities that rely upon the way your body is and what it can handle. The thing is though nobody knows what is their body can handle till they try and not everybody has to be a world-class athlete to be happy with their efforts. \n\nTelling people that talent has a role in these kinds of things just causes them to never even attempt them. It's stupid, people should be realistic that not everyone will succeed, but they should also understand they have no idea if they will be one of them till they try.",

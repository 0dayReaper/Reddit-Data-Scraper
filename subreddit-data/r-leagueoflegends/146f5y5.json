If 9000 of that damage is in his E then at least he has to hit his skillshot on you to kill you. Akali could just E backwards and then kill you with no risk of missing and being out of range. \n\nStill miss bruiserish Sylas though. Having to hit your autos between every ability because they didn't stack felt really good, as opposed to pressing all your buttons and then turning into a beyblade.",

She had terrible numbers for a reason.\n\nCurrent Akali has been balanced for a long while now, she's just annoying.

He was one of the best divers in the game because of it. If you look at a diving tanks job of putting pressure on carry\u2019s and living for as long as possible in a fight, tank fizz was the best at it. Sitting on top of his e gave him essentially free zhonyas on a low cd. It\u2019s annoying when an ap assassin can do that, but when a tank does it they are actually pretty much impossible to kill when playing properly. \n\nEkko had a similar problem with getting too much value out of tank stats by being able to refill his hp bar for free with his ult. His w gave pretty good utility with big aoe stuns that he could more consistently proc because he was so fucking tanky. An ice born proc on a carry means they have to flash/ cleanse your stun because it\u2019s gonna hit. It\u2019s pretty decent, but what really pushed it over was all that plus insane base damage.",

Harder champs will and should always dominate easier champs because of the effort put in. Which means there will always be pro play stables and that's okay.

I get the similarities between tank Ekko and K'Sante, but tank Ekko was busted in literally every elo.\n\nIf you reverted Ekko R healing, I think you'd have tank Ekko back on the spot. Getting to nope out and try again for free is what broke tank Ekko imo. I think you're on the money with K'Sante getting to revert into a tank from All Out basically at will. Tradeoffs don't work balance-wise if you get to control the tradeoff completely. The time before recast should be increased.",

Right now, most people complaining never spent a game or two playing him and are confusing the fact that a lot of his kit is backloaded displacements, and the fact that he's high WR in challenger.\n\nK'sante is far, far, far from being Akali level of toxic when she was invisible to towers. His kit requires you to play him a bit and get used to the visual and gameplay loop. It is much more work than when Vex or Millio comes out, but it's not that bad.

Fizz a bit less so, so in that comparison it seems similar. Ekko was egregious, he just 0 skill shot ran you down and ulted away. Or ult back to lane and save tp. And his % missing auto damage was absurdly high base scaling. K'Sante's biggest problem is that Jak'Sho + Gargoyle (which is horrible on just about every other tank) provides him his best damage items and tank items. Gargoyle is really bad on most tanks, as the huge shield is often decayed because you have so many resists. K'Sante makes good use of the active after ulting because he's automatically low hp and resists",

But he's easily killable in ult form, and the damage he gets from ulting falls off extremely hard as the game goes on. Plus his build paths kinda suck. Build tank and you'll lose all your stats in ult anyway, without getting that much damage potential in return. Build bruiser and you wont be tanky at all. \n\nHis Q3+W+R combo CC is pretty ridiculous, but it takes a relatively long time to set up, especially when out of lane - not to mention how he was to get into a position to insec in order to effectively set up for his team. Unlike most other tanks whose abilities have a million times higher engage value than he does\n\nHis slipperiness is probably the most egregious thing about him, but even then it's not out of control. Want to ult an enemy squishy? Good luck lol, your base form dash is tiny, reaching backline without flash is very hard\n\nI see how annoying he is in lane, but he just falls off so hard to me. It's very hard to actually win games with him imo",

He swaps to % max hp true damage on his passive which scales extremely hard into late game. Ksante easily solos a tank in 5 seconds 100-0 after ulting, and the base AD increase alone is enough for him to kill a squishy. I regularly ult tanks over the wall and kill them with Q-AA-W-AA-Q-A-EQ-AA (sounds like a lot but this takes barely any time). \n\nAlso he is definitely fine late game (not as OP as lane I\u2019ll admit). He is one of the very rare tanks who holds his own on the sidelane vs traditional side laners like Jax. He also is an amazing anti diver and can reliably get picks with flash-R or just land Q3 on a squishy.",

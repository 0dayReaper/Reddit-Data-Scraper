    "postText": "For context I\u2019m a mid gold midlaner who play Akali, Zoe, and Cassio, who has played majority of champions, including hyper scalers like Azir, Veigar, etc. But I\u2019ve lately found, I find some hyper scalers so hard to play. 2 champions that come to my are A\u2019Sol and Malzahar. By the time you come online, the game already feels over 99% of the time, either for or against you. Early game champions can at least roam, or champions like Azir and Veigar can win lane, which I didn\u2019t feel felt possible on A\u2019Sol, Malzahar a bit more possible, but A\u2019Sol it felt very hard to do. What can be done to come online earlier and make them feel viable?",

            "comment": "Most important thing when playing hyper scalers is to be gold-efficient. You need to hit your spikes as early as possible.\n\nNever miss uncontested CS. Never miss waves. Get plates if your enemy laner roams. Don't build unnecessary items/components.\n\nA lot of lower elo players kinda stop farming as soon as the laning phase is over; you need to be constantly getting CS on side lanes as safely as you can. 10CS/min is the expectation, and you need to keep doing it the *whole* game.\n\nIt's always gonna be hard, though. Scaling champions are, by definition, weak early.",

                    "comment": "I think the most important part is actually being able to fight well in the late game. You're not going to be able to help your side lanes as Asol or Azir. You're probably going to have to give first drake and first herald (unless your side lanes win hard enough that you're not even the deciding factor anyway). So, from 25 minutes onwards, you best be ready to carry your team through the kills and towers deficit that happened around you while you were farming up\n\nNemesis loves playing these sorts of champions, and he shows how there's such a high burden to execute well mechanically when you're playing this slow style against really good opponents",

            "comment": "While the other comments I do agree with, I think it\u2019s also just a sign of the game shifting and these champs not really being accommodated for. \n\nAs someone who plays kayle solo I really am beginning to feel the shrinking game lengths across the board. Item spikes are happening quicker, objectives are becoming contested earlier and all of this causes people to lean more and more on early game hyper aggressive champs that usually stomp on late game scalers.",

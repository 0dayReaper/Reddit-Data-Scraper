Solution? win more so that your MMR climb near your rank even with less lp gains there should be a point where it should balance out and get back to normal. this is my understanding of it but I could be wrong.",

Even a new bronze account that I played 10 games in last year to get silver. This season after placement I'm already plat. There's no reason to play hundreds of games just to be stuck in silver/gold when you can just spend 1$ on a new account",

I assume (again nobody knows) there will be some luck involved, as matchmaking has to organize matches around the players available, I guess it should be possible the game only found weaker matches for you to play for the moment being (millions of matches organized, there will be inlucky streaks), but otherwise will assign you stronger matches later, we don't know. As I mentioned wr is irrelevant, the estimated strength of your enemies are what defines whether you gain or lose more in an ELO system - you can have a 90% wr and be stuck in bronze, if your opponents are for whatever reason iron MMR, you won't climb. Yes, ideally you would be assigned only iron matches, but you could just be extremely unlucky or the algorithm is very bad (again, nobody knows, this could just be the case).",

I mean it's already clear, they want their game to be this toxic garbage disposal, because if they didn't they would've at the very least removed the option for mature language filter and by now filtered out all the swearwords. eh.. why do I bother writing, it's like am talking to a fkn gravestone anyway game's dead asf and will never recover.",

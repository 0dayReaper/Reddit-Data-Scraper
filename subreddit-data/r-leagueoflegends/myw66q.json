So he can definitely gain an advantage in lane, but not such a heavy advantage that he can misplay. Darius punishes misplays really hard.\n\nPast laning phase Wukong is an excellent team fight champion and diver. He can lower Darius\u2019s armor and knock him up to help his team plough through him on the front line, or he can dive the backline and be more threatening than Darius who needs to stack his passive.",

Regardless of which site you pull stats from Kled is one of the worst matchups or *the* worst matchup for Wukong. So either Wukong is actually incredibly imbalanced or the matchup is definitely not \"brutal\" for at least one AD top.\n\nLate game Wukong can maybe claw his way back into relevance if he's left alone to farm or gets effective roams but it's going to be very difficult against a Kled who's dominating lane. Kled snowballs very hard and a fed one will run an underfed top laner down mercilessly, or use ult to counter Wukong's roams and kill him and his team when he gets there.",

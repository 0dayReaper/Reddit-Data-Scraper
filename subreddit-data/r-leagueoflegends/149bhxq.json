    "postText": "So I've recently been playing a lot of gwen and I feel like I always have a lead and can always make myself useful but everytime I pick her it feels like my team is doing everything they can not to win. I know that's not the case but I'm just unsure of where to look to find what else I can do to ensure I win these games instead of losing when I'm fed. Op.gg is FlamminfCarrot1 \nNA \nAny help would be much appreciated",

Grind out more games on her, just get more experience.",

I win lane 90% of the time it's just after I can't close out even when I lose lane I'm always even in levels and gold so I'm never behind but I just can't seem to make it more then a 1v5 on my side I always feel alone",

It absolutely \\*is\\* about your champion. Macro calls after laning phase are dependent on what champion you are playing.\n\nEven still, it should be clear and obvious that you have a deficiency in games with Gwen, and something that you can \\*absolutely\\* do is play more games with her. It's a relatively easy thing to do. Do the easy stuff first.",

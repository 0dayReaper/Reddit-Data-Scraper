    "postText": "LPL legend UZI will make his return to the league, as he has officially signed with EDG. UZI has accumulated many accolades over the years and is looking to make another mark on his storied career. UZI\u2019s last stint of play was with the BLG super team in 2022. EDG games (as with all top tier LPL teams\u2019) will be a banger this year, don\u2019t forget to tune into their matchups when UZI will take the stage!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ly2wb0wz255b1.jpg?width=1050&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=664cdb6539176c23a0c4ffe836d184cc9d5827de",

However, KT has had 0 international success and tend to stray towards the mid table of the LCK, with a couple of exceptions (2 domestic titles iirc?) in the past 10 years. At this point the rivalry is more of a cultural one than a competitive one, which is what I was getting at with the Leeds example. Liverpool vs United is still a competitive rivalry, Leeds vs United is more often than not a wash. T1 vs GenG is competitive, KT vs T1 is (most often) not.",

Uzi worked worse with the team maybe, but he still had great laning and was mechanically very good, just made a couple boneheaded decisions and looked out of sync with his team.

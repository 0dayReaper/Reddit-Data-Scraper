    "postText": "The official announcement was made in [this](https://twitter.com/paiNGamingBR/status/1668332342824550402?s=20) tweet.\n\nIn the video she says:\n\n&gt;When I joined paiN Gaming... Not many people know this story, but it was very tumultuous. I had left my previous team, I couldn't found a team and the second split (2022) already had started, but then paiN Gaming contacted me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The adaptation and the routine was difficult, but it was really good to join paiN. The fans are wonderful and received me very well. I try to see their expectations as a good thing, because they are very passionate... I think that sometimes, with me, they are even a little bit more passionate... Because they are always there asking to see me play. About the female fans, it seems that they are in everything... I really like the Herdeiras (Herdeiras da Tradi\u00e7\u00e3o, paiN Gaming's female fan group.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This will be the first time that I will have a big responsibility, I will try not to let myself be overwhelmed by things, i'll focus on my responsibilities... But I know that when the time comes, I will be very nervous.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I think a lot about the fans too, because they demanded (her to play) and now the time has come and I don't want to disappoint them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The time that everyone has been waiting has come, I am as excited as you fans are and I will do my best to not let you down.\n\nShe had already played for paiN in Split 2 of Academy in 2022 (split that she joined the team), but she was replacing ProDelta (starter Academy support in that split and now he is in paiN Gaming CBLoL) and at that time, paiN Gaming already had qualified for Academy Playoffs.\n\nShe did not play in Split 1 of 2023, probably because she was not yet fully adapted (she even talked about it on Twitter). But now she has assumed the starting position and even made her debut with a win against LOUD Academy (she played with Nami + Lucian botlane and had a KDA: 0/1/12).\n\nI don't remember any girl taking the starting position for an Academy team here in the CBLoL, they were always at best a reserve. This is huge news, especially since paiN Gaming has the biggest fanbase relative to LoL in Brazil.\n\n***Note: paiN Gaming missed the Academy playoffs in the Split 1 / 2023. In other words, it is not an overpowered team that will \"carry her\" for the organization make marketing.***\n\n***They also didn't change any pieces of the roster for the second split, only her who assumed the starting position. If the team performs better than they performed in Split 1, she will have her merits.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This is huge news, especially since paiN Gaming has the biggest fanbase relative to LoL in Brazil.\n\nWell, I understand what you meant about having very few female players in the top two tiers of Brazilian competitive, but it's important to remember that we have some initiatives that enable female players to access top teams (although I haven't found or can't confirm if this project is still active). One example is the Sakura Project, in which players with good performances were recruited for CBLOL teams and even got to play with the teams during the off-season in the[Superliga ABCDE](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Superliga_ABCDE) championship (an event organized by a players' association, equivalent to LCSPA) that resembled the off-season tournament that took place before the spring split of LCS.\n\nPlayers like Mayumi, Cute, and Kiit have played for teams INTZ, CNB, and Bulldozer, respectively. Of course, these are just a few examples, but if you check the league's link, you'll get an idea that there were other opportunities. However, indeed, very few had a chance to move up in the competitive tiers, and even with the project, it was still very challenging. We can say that it wasn't enough to facilitate access for female players. Let's hope that the efforts of everyone, regardless of gender, will allow for the development of new talents.\n\nLets hope that more Shakespeare (the LJL female proplayer) is one of too many that is yet to come!",

The CBLoL Academy, unlike what had been happening in the NA for example, actually promotes young players to the CBLoL.\n\n\\--/--\n\nAnother cool thing is that Juny (jungler of the Inclusive paiN Gaming team, runner-up of the Ignis Cup) was also joined (as a reserve) paiN Gaming Academy:\n\n&gt;[Thanks for everyone who was happy with my academy inscription](https://twitter.com/junylol1/status/1667590385047154689?s=20)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[I'm still feeling a little bit nervous, because I think I'm pretty good at soloqueue but I still think that I have a lot to learn competitively, so, it will be a nice experience](https://twitter.com/junylol1/status/1667590385047154689?s=20)\n\nJuny has 2 Challanger accounts in the BR solo queue.",

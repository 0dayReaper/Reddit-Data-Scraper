I currently am using \u2018Akana\u2019 for Akali and Qiyana combined, but am no longer using Qiyana as I don\u2019t like how she seems to have shifted into a mid game champion from early game. I digress, I am now wanting something for Akali and Zoe, but I\u2019ve failed to find something that gels. I also play Cassiopeia, Jinx and Xayah. And if it helps, I am also big into Pok\u00e9mon. Mudkip, Emolga, Turtwig, Celebi, Lapras, Victini, Zorua, are my 7 fav Pok\u00e9mon (in order). I would be super grateful to anyone who can give me a decent sounding username!",

    "postText": "Hey guys!   \nIm writing here, because I have no clue how to properly delve into this game.\n\nI used to play alot of HOTS in its prime but now most of my friends play LoL.   \nI've been trying to get into this game since season 10 I think, little by little ( I do not have alot of spare time unfortunately :/)   \n\n\nI mostly tried jungle, focusing on easy heroes like Udyr (before rework) and Xin Zhao or Rammus. I mostly played draft games but recently I began playing ranked.   \nDespite being in lowest possible rank, I still find myself playing against people who are 10 times better than me at everything.   \n\n\nThe moment I screw up something, die or not be where I was supposed to be I get flamed, pinged and  game proceeds to either forfeit or shit on me from both teams.   \n\n\nI've tried watching many videos about laning, jungle path, what to do and what not to do, yet still I find myself confused at various parts of the game, especially mid to late game where I get 1 shot by enemy champions most often. \n\nI tried changing my lane to top but I get annihilated and I feel like im playing a singleplayer \\*get destroyed\\* game in which one bad trade or poor luck with enemy jungler lurking nearby gets me thrown into the void  of staying behind everone for the rest of the game. \n\n  \nIs there any way to make the learning curve any less steep? Are there anything valueable I can learn/do to make myself better at this game? Everyone seems to be an expert when it comes to knowing what to do and what not to do.  \n\n\n BTW, Im using Blitz/online \"bis\" lists so to say for runes, gearing and so on.",

They are probably just as wrong as you are.\n\nDiagnosing gameplay mistakes through a text like this is really hard. you should probably get someone who coaches for free (and is decently high ranked) and/or watch a lot of high elo players play the same champs as you.",

If you queue up in ranked you are automatically assigned smth around gold mmr, meaning by getting dumpstered for smth like 50 games you recede to your actual skill level.\nBy queuing with bots for a prologed period of time longer than say 3 matches all you are doing is making this process longer than it needs to be\n\nTo point out directly, initially you dont face iron players you face gold players, ah such a laughable difficulty eh?",

The whole point of this is to learn how  league of legends works **YOUR WAY** before spending 2 hours getting dumpstered by seasoned players, spending half that time in the grey screen.

That said, if you find yourself playing against the same 3-4 champs every game it might be worth it to see if your matchup into whatever is popular is good. Taking veigar mid lane from low ELO up higher is perfectly fine for example, but doing it when everyone is playing fizz/kat/zed mid is gonna be a lot harder than if assassin's aren't as popular.    You don't need to counter pick, but if games stay really hard, check and see if your champ of choice is just hard countered by whatever is currently popular at your elo",

It's not a big deal to do well by your own, and ignore idiots.\n\nFirstly, don't feel bad because most people in bronze are hardstuck and been playing for 10 years.\n\nFuck around with the champions, just try this champion in Draft pick to see what it does, in Drafts it doesn't matter if you lose/win, it's about learning. Take like a game each day to do this. Focus on the learning part, not the tilt part. \n\nSo you have to understand, this game is very imperfect since inception. It's known for being centered on objectives, combos and counters and people who get good at playing around this easily get to Plat. Eventually you will see who counters who (go to Lolalytics and search the matchup), what this champion does, what you can do against the champion (run away or time an ability, expect an attack and counter). You will learn by experience and time, give several months for it to make sense.\n\nIn my experience as a top laner, I don't overcomplicate it. I'm there to win without nonsense, so I just made up these simple goals.\n\n1. Don't fight/do something dumb. Try not to die.\n2. Whoever wins usually gets lead in level and item, so you shouldn't give them more kills.\n3. Try to last hit every minions, mostly the opponent makes some dumb mistake and falls behind.\n\nThe thing with new players is it's hard in this game unless they learn the thought process from an experienced player (the game gets more complex every update). So keep asking advice, that might help. Watching videos isn't the same thing as developing game sense and muscle memory, just do things that make sense like don't die and push when the laner is roaming. When you focus on your mouse clicking, that also hurts, it should just be muscle memory while you think within the game.\n\nThe game is so complex that I can't tell you how to do things, you will learn what NOT to do instead. And over time you will learn what MAKES SENSE to do. It's a repetitive game, lane base on matchup, last hit minion, play objectives, push. Good luck.",

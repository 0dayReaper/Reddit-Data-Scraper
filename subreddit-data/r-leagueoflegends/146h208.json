    "postText": "Such drastic swings in the game state just feel unrewarding. Playing well in lane only to have to player super safe in the mid to late game feels unrewarding. You shouldn't be rewarded for playing horrendously than scoring a kill while the other team is inherently taking more risk fighting closer to your base. ",

I would agree that it feels like shit to give up a 700 gold bounty, but on the flip side I think it adds some much needed agency. You can't control if your teammates are gonna giga feed, but you do have control over whether or not you can kill the enemy with the bounty.",

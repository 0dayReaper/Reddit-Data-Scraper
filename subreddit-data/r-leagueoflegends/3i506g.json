Viktor + Yasuo game 1 completely caught TSM off guard - and the genius of the comp is that CLG wasn't even using Yasuo for damage, just for his knockup. Pobelter went glass cannon on Viktor (Luden's into Deathcap) and blew up TSM's squishies every fight after Zion held them in place.\n\nGames 2 and 3 felt like TSM going into full panic mode because bans weren't enough to shut down CLG's combos. Kalista and Tristana bans became mandatory and that meant Xmithie got comfort picks every time; plus TSM was scared of CLG counterpicking Bjergsen's Viktor and ended up letting Pobelter get him all three games. Santiron didn't look comfortable on Ecco whatsoever in game 2. Bjergsen taking away Yasuo felt 100% like a reactive pick since TSM has literally no answer to Zion's Yasuo. You also saw how Pobelter adjusted his build in games 2 and 3, going Hourglass first since there was no longer a need to go glass cannon.\n\nTSM ended up picking Kog all 3 games as well, which was weird because Sivir (one of Turtle's more common picks) was open the whole series. Maybe TSM was afraid of Doublelift's Kog'Maw - regardless, even if these were planned-out comps from TSM, this entire series felt more like they were scrambling to take away picks from CLG that they themselves didn't fully understand how to play.\n\nReally well played by CLG, with an absolutely fantastic draft.\n\n[Obligatory meme](http://gfycat.com/TornEmptyIggypops)",

TSM in the past few years has been one of the strongest if not the strongest team in North America. They always perform very well in playoffs, while CLG usually performs poorly in playoffs and has been struggling the last few years. CLG has just beaten TSM 3-0 in a best of 5 in the North American finals.\n\n\nBesides bragging rights and the trophy and all that, getting first place in North America is extremely important because of the world championship. The winner of this match (CLG) gets first seed for North America, meaning that they get to play lower seeded teams from other regions and do not have to play against the top team from other regions in the group stage of the tournament.\n\n\nEDIT: Both teams will still be going to the World Championship. TSM performed well enough during the first half-season (split) of play combined with their second place finish this split to lock them in as the 2nd seed from North America. CLG will be attending as the 1st seed. The 3rd and last seed for North America will be decided in a Qualifier next week.",

They were all great players on their own but could never find the teamwork you need to succeed at a professional level until now.\n\nCLG is that old veteran who you always kind of wanted to win just to see it finally happen and they did it at Madison Square Garden against their longtime rival (TSM) and finally got their fairy tale ending.",

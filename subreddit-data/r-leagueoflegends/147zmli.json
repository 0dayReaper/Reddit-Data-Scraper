    "postText": "Maybe one of the most unpopular here but i thinkt it is. A game should be fun and everyones time is limited, so why would you waste your time playing a game that seems not fun from the start? Everyone has some champs/combos they hate playing against and riot creates unbalanced op champs every patch, making your 1 ban quite useless to get rid of all those. So why playing a game against op, counter or hatet champs that you wont enjoy? \n\nSame in game, why stay in a 9-23 game where 2 people wont ff? Even tho the enemy has a lategame team and its obviously lost?\n\nIf you dont enjoy the game on atleast a basic level, dodge or leave and go for another one. Freetime is rare and you should enjoy it, dont waste it.\n\nEdit: as far as i know \"dodging\" is the term for leaving in champ select and thats how i used it.",

You aren't just ruining the game for your fellow team mates, the enemy who intended to play, now has an easy stomp which arguably, is not fun either.",

You want to only play games where you have the matchup advantage?  If everybody had your weak mindset then no games would ever happen because they would dodge when you get the upper hand.  \n\nIf you want to dodge those, it's acceptable but shows a lot about your mentality that leads to the other scenario which is a bigger issue.  \n\nAfking if you get behind is just pathetic and selfish.   You're wasting the time of at least 5 people but probably more.  Your teammates don't deserve having somebody afk.  The other team likely has some people just after LP but some might be looking to improve their gameplay which doesn't happen if cowards just leave.  \n\nAlso, in your low ELO games people suck at ending and are very prone to throwing a lead or making dumb plays so almost any game is winnable.  \n\nWhy not continue playing a game that you supposedly enjoy instead of just sitting waiting afk to go queue for another game where you will do it again if it goes wrong?  Stick to ARAM or customs, so the rest of us can have better games.\n\nIf it was acceptable, there wouldn't be a report option specifically for this and punishment associated with it.",

And I mean like auto 2 week ban, AND minus 125 LP (roughly equal to an entire teams worth of lost LP)... once you are past the remake point? You are a team. And the team decides stuff together.

I mean sure there are ban\u2018s and leaverbuster but often enough they will not be applied. I remember back in 2016, i left one game because of some urgent matter and i got the leaverbuster as soon as i left.

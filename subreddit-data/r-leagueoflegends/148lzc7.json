Will i ever get better? Is there a chance for me ? Or am i just genetically unable to actually even keep track of my own cursor in a teamfight.",

In that moment my primary attention is 100% on dodging that malphite ult, or staying out of range. Team fights are chaotic and the game has so much damage now it\u2019s impossible to focus on everything happening at once, you will learn to pick and choose to focus on what\u2019s most important in the moment for winning/survival",

It just takes time to get used to the differences between mobile and PC, I guess.\nYou are right about Galio though, since AD/Lethality is still strong now, he can't make good use of his MR passive, but if you like him, play him. \nI don't know where you are from or what languages you speak, but in the official German discord, there is a channel where newbies can ask for more experienced players to play with them, and I'm sure you would find someone willing to play bot or even unranked games with you, to show you a few things.",

You want that OFF.\n\nAlso, auto attack move with \"attack move\" or \"attack move click\" instead of just right click. This allows you to miss your target slightly and still register an attack command instead of a movement command.\n\nSlightly less important - try to keep your mouse sensitivity in windows and the league of legends client in the middle. If you want your cursor to be faster or slower, do it through your mouse's \"dpi\" setting instead. The program you use to do this will vary by mouse manufacturer.",

She has a long Auto Attack range so you can work on last hitting Creeps pretty safely.  Her Q resets if it kills a minion so helps with CSing even better, and I think a more simplistic style of play like that allows for more macro skills learning.",

You already have the general knowledge about a lot of stuff that many new players get absolutely overwhelmed and dumpstered by, so you are doing well and are on a very good, steady track.\n\nMechanically intensive, combo heavy champs you mentioned can be difficult, but since you already know a lot of the macro stuff, it shouldn't be too big of an issue. I also suggest playing an ADC/Ranged champion along with it so you can get used to kiting and auto attacking, I personally started with Zed and Jinx when I first played the game. I highly recommend getting a friend to play with you, or meet up someone to duo with, it will smoothen out the experience A LOT and will make it substantially better, in my opinion.",

The best advice for bronze people is typically \"fight a lot less.\" Take objectives, take waves, dont spam fight every time your screen isn't gray. First focus on what you personally should be rotating towards once some towers fall, once you figure that out and get an idea of macro plays, then you ping for allies to rotate towards where you think they should go. In bronze you're going to get ignored a lot, you might be wrong a lot, but simply having everyone on the same page is a big step up. You ping twice to do baron? Maybe your team goes there, maybe someone pings off and you dont do it. Either way you alerted the team to the possibility of doing it soon and consistent communication throughout the game is a good thing- keep people from autopiloting. Just play some more if you're enjoying it, you will absolutely get better.",

Use that champ almost exclusively while learning the game for a bit, that way you can keep the champion and runes consistent, while focusing on learning macro and gameplay mechanics. Once you've got a good understanding of macro and mechanics you can start branching out and trying different champions.   \n\n\nIt's better to keep as many things consistent as you can while first starting off, and working on each gameplay aspect at a time. For instance, first learn the champ you want to play and what they do, then move on to improving your CSing in lane or jungle clear (I don't suggest playing JG if you are new), and once you got a good grasp on that you can work on wave management, rotating, etc... Progression based learning and practice.",

It's just muscle memory, you barely think about clicking the mouse itself, your attention is set elsewhere within the game while the background is happening on your brain and hand. This takes experience and time, you need to take rests for your brain to actually develop muscle memory. This means no need to grind, do something outside gaming after a few rough games (even if just 1 or 2).\n\nDon't let it get to you, I will tell you myself I sucked for a few years when I started because I never played with a mouse before. But over time and experience, I barely even think about it. League is a repetitive game. The same patterns of the game repeat over and over, which is why even dumb people become good at it because they never think back once they do things properly. Just let the first months of experience happen, avoid mental tilt or making it a big deal. Take breaks, get off League sometime, and you will ultimately get better over time, because your brain is there learning even when you don't  think so. Best wishes.",

For every role, there are champions that are just easier to master in general, and require less playmaking skills. If you have a hard time with micro, I strongly suggest picking such a champ. I struggled with the same problem playing mid btw, then picked up Malzahar, and I got to plat with him basically not playing the game per se (game meaning talent cockfight in this context). I just accepted that most mids are more talented than me, so I afk farmed, then focused on landing a good ult, and some poke before the fight. Find your nieche :)",

You clearly have a problem with deep water in your case (as most would, it is only natural) so I suggest picking up an easy champ, then when you are comfortable moving onto increasingly harder and see how it goes if that is what you desire - you'll find your ceiling sooner or later, whatever you are still comfortable with but is also more difficult than Malphite. Luckily you'll find a fine gradual scale for champion difficulty in League with the hundreds of champions available.",

League being a considerably big one doesn't make it easier tho.\n\nImo, there are A LOT of guides for beginners and most things to learn in terms of 'fundamentals' all have some sort of content to watch and test out then.\n\nA lot will also depend on you, your playstyle, the champs you play and how well you play them...\n\nAnd a big thing: Matchups. So which champions you have to play against in lane.\n\nEspecially the last 2 things are points you will only learn by playing. And you need to play a lot. I mean we have like over 150 champions in this game, learning matchups... Adapting to player, etc. takes A LOT of time. Just try not to rush things and just enjoy the game.",

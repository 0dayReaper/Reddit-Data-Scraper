No where did I say it was a BAD thing, nor did I make it a joke and laugh about it, I merely stated what is clearly the obvious. If it was leaked by the girl/a third party that is not a good thing of course. But the actions of Photic that were revealed with the leak are what I\u2019m saying are down bad. \n\nEven originally i only brought up photic as we were talking about ppl that have had scandals involving girls, it didn\u2019t say anywhere it had to be crime related like Leave prostitute or whatever, only that he is one of the dudes that has had a girl scandal, which is also true. \n\nBut aiight bruh lol",

RNG wanted breathe and BLG wanted Bin but the WBG didn\u2019t want to give BLG Bin and WE didn\u2019t want to give RNG Breathe. So they made a mutual agreement to buy the top laner that the other team wanted and Uzi was roped in as part of the package to BLG since he wanted to play that year as well. Of course it all backfired when Bin turns out to be the real deal and was given to BLG as per the contract.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/v2iwff/official_bin_joins_blg_and_breathe_joins_rng/iasl0k4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1&amp;context=3",

EDG has been to like 6 quarterfinals, but only advanced once and when they did, they won worlds. Deft has also been to many quarterfinals, but unlike EDG he advanced to Semifinals twice. First time was on SSB in 2014 but got knocked out by SSW, and the second time was the DRX run. It'd be sick to see the two \"quarterfinals\" cursed player/team fight eachother for the semis spot.",

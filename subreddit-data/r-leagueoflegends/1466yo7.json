    "postText": "So will Riot change flex queue anytime soon or will they just leave it like the broken mess it is for eternity?\n\nI see the potential in an actual team based ranked mode but as off right now that queue is just broken. I am plat 2-3 stucker and play with friends flex more often then not and i hit master just by playing with friends i only played vs bronze players even tho i was dia. It clearly has a lot of issues.\n\nI dont get how this works and how it would ever be competetiv but i really hope they change that mode soon, so that it actually has some sort of skill expression.\n\n Maybe make it more team focused or something instead of just normal game 2 idk tho.",

            "comment": "I miss when flex had rank restrictions. Without the queue restrictions, it's literally just norms with a rank, and that genuinely sucks. At least it should account for mmr when it comes to solo players so you're not stuck in s mixed party with a dia 2 silvers and a bronze, against a team that's got like 3 plats and 2 dia, as a solo plat.",

            "comment": "Matchmaking depends on the players, if not many people better than you are playing then you rising means it's working as intended. Flex queue needs more serious players to become more serious, there is very little that Riot can do to change people's minds, and as long as people don't care much, there's little incentive for them to do work that few people will appreciate.",

    "postText": "At this point I'm kind of sick of all the posts complaining about the toxic smurfs when in reality if you look at the games it's just a matter of The pot calling the Kettle black.\n\nAs much as I agree with the fact that there are a huge bunch of toxic smurfs. Why does the league community never acknowledge the shitty things that new players do and always paint them as the victim.\n\nSome examples of such behaviour include :rage quitting games the moment lane doesn't go their way, throwing tantrums at teammates who try to teach them how lane works and the game in general and acting like a 12 year old ( I understand most new players are younger but holy fuck ) And also just pointlessly being toxic to the whole server in all chat \n\nAnd lastly, the specific group of new players I would like to call out are those who decide to mute all, completely run it down with the intention of never learning/ignoring all pings while having the entitled attitude that no one is ever allowed to get annoyed at them (I blame this sub for enabling such methods btw) \n\nThis has been going on for years but I believe that this just had to be said. Hopefully games will start being more enjoyable again but I don't really have hope anymore tbh",

It\u2019s rare that I go more than 5 games without someone griefing in champ select (either by picking/banning someone\u2019s champ on purpose or stealing roles) or just blatantly inting and trolling in game. And that\u2019s just my team. If it includes someone on the enemy team mental booking, that number drops to maybe 1 in 3 games. The toxicity and rage I saw when leveling a fresh account for a dedicated ranked grind was fucking insane.",

If I am playing a game, typically I don't like being told \"Do this, it's the best build and an easy way to get to the late game fast\". \n\nNew players quitting is just always going to happen, as they haven't really invested into the game and they will just hop onto another if there isn't enough time. That isn't \"toxic\".",

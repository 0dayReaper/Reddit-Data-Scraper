The main one right now is that if i\u2019m engaged in a fight (my AA is off by the way), and i love holding down my right click to move or even tapping it, 9 times out of 10 i\u2019ll accidentally click on a minion as i\u2019m trying to escape and i\u2019ll just be stuck standing still hitting the minion as the enemy team goes to town on me. I\u2019m so sick and tired of this, i have no idea why they made the attack and move the same button because it constantly screws me over. i\u2019ve tried to change the attack button to left click but it won\u2019t let me, i\u2019m honestly just stuck. does anyone have any idea what i could do",

As a support main myself i recon you Look into positioning for laningphase, that really helps a lot. And try to not keep your mouse button down, if you klick more you have a fester reactiontime.",

            "comment": "When you\u2019re moving around the best way to do it is to have your cursor really close to your champion. That way it\u2019s really easy to change direction. Logically if your cursor is really close then you can only move small distances in a single click, therefore have to click regularly. So if you click on a minion and start to attack, your next moment command will instantly cancel the attack and keep you moving. \n\nOr at least I think that\u2019s what I do. Honestly I barely use any fancy hot keys about targeting since I mainly play mages, tanks or AD casters, but cannot remember ever having this issue.",

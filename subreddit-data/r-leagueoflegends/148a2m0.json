His biggest issue mid is that maxing Q leaves him with subpar waveclear.\n\nBrand just needs a mini rework honestly, keep the W and R but E and Q probably need some serious changes. The fact he relies on two abilities to have any self-peel (and Q is really unreliable to land) means he'll never see play mid.\n\nIn general nerfing base damages and buffing scalings on some of those champions (or increasing the speed of some of their CC abilities) would already be huge in moving them to mid. Hell, we saw Annie go back to mid (and see pro play) with just some minor tweaks.\n\n- Zyra has 180% AP on her full combo (with no plant hits). Her full combo is also not super easy to land, while having low scalings.\n\n- Xerath has 235% with a normal W hit and one ult hit, potential 455% with a perfect W hit and every ult shot. Problem his all his abilities are super unreliable. In most cases you'll land a normal W and an ult shot, not your entire potential dmg.\n\n- Brand has 185% with a normal W hit, 200% if empowered. Super low scalings in general, even if you take into account his passive. His R has a pathetic 25% scaling.\n\n- Vel'Koz is the closest to normal mage scalings with 340%, but this relies on landing a full ultimate which even with his EWQR combo is unlikely to happen. His W's full damage only ever goes off if you combo with E, and E also does pathetic damage.\n\nWe can compare these with Syndra's 340% (double Q hit + W + E + R with base spheres plus the two Qs, fairly average scenario), Veigar's 250% (which isn't even that high but his passive makes up for it), Viktor's 280% (without any ult ticks) or Ahri's 303% (full W, double Q hit and 3 ult dashes).",

Score and Ambition becoming Junglers is possibly the most famous example of successful role swaps, Bwipo as a more recent western example too\n\nThe reality is that bad players exist in all roles and not only that, but there are plenty of good players who have bad games and when you only play with them once or a handful of times, you're gonna form an (incorrect) opinion on them with only a small sample size \n\nI still don't understand the idea that support is the most elo inflating role, even having never been a support main in 10 years of playing LoL, and no one ever presents a good argument for it that doesn't just resort to basically insulting support players with no real substance to their argument lol\n\nYeah no shit people tend to perform worse off their main role. That's true for every role and almost every player in solo queue",

You can influence how your jungler and your opponent jungler plays heavily by actually getting deeper vision as a top laner and make more informed moves on how to play based upon the vision you've gotten, and you definitely can do thing like hit 6, roam bot, tele top. etc.  \n\n\nThis is generally the same as people saying ADC is weak for the past 6-7 seasons while they continue to select combos/champions who have little to no agency when you could pick something that does give you agency in the lane and kill pressure.  \n\n\nLike genuinely it's not really that hard to have an impact on the game state even in the early game as a top laner. Even if it's as simple as harassing the enemy jungler with your xp lead. Or causing your jungler to have xp advantage by stealing a camp or two.",

What I see is a lot of adcs and junglers are actually putting the blame on support for a mistake coming from them in the first place.\n\nIndeed, it is really easy for an ADC to blame the supp when the lane doesn't go well, because how the lane is going higly relies on supports.\n\nAnd when it comes to roaming, I see a lot of junglers blaming because enemy supp is more present, either because he has better roaming possibilities, and often because jungler is not respecting timings at all or not giving space for his supp to roam.\n\nWhat I see overall is people are sadly often blaming the role (or champion) they don't have a lot of knowledge on (which is one of the reasons jungle gets blamed the most). That's not always the case but I feel like it is when the flame is the strongest.",

Support is the role for people who are cowards in real life and know they can get away without conflict\n\nEdit: And it is also elo inflated, from first hand experience, I tried all other roles before being a support main in ranked, I was eternally bronze but as sup I am going up the ladder easily. It is such an easy role I can make stupid mistakes but as long as I leave lane towards rift hearld to help my jungler we always win, that's it. You leave lane for 1 minute and follow your jungler or go mid and win the game. It IS AN EASY ROLE.",

I usually help my adc get ahead and then roam to help other lanes, but when other lanes get solokilled in the first few minutes of the game and then every minute afterward it's hard to help them (and can't do shit vs heavy engage).",

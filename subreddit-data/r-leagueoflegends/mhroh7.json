Did you pick someone with ranged autos into Yas? His W is hugely powerful. Did you pick Renekton? He has no W in lane.

Solo queue is disorganized, so it can be incredibly frustrating being insanely ahead while having your team ignore you while you are fed and you just die to a semi fed assassin. At least with some mid laners you can just dump your spells before you die and do some damage. \n\nSure you can outplay it...but it always looks like an adc has to play two divisions up to solo carry a game while other roles just need to play one division up. \n\nAn Ashe can be stupid fed, but if the team doesn\u2019t peel she is basically useless. \n\nThis is why I main support though...if I do well two people are ahead and I can actually protect the people who are fed.",

If he kills you before it expires, he gets to keep that 10% until you respawn.\n\n\n10% might not seem huge, and earlier in the game it isn't all that crazy, but lategame it's basically a temporary item's worth of stats.",

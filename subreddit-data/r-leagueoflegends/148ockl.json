With the amount of damage/mobility in the game, most mages need to be able to get some form of safety to even exist if the enemy team picks any viable assassin. Is it overtuned? Sure. The active is overtuned. But without it, champions like lux, Annie, TF, Xerath and others simply can\u2019t survive against the plethora of AD champions that can instantly gap close and delete them.",

When i started playing in S1 me and what felt like a good chunk of the community were only using custom skins and never bought any real skins. I remember saying something like the following to a friend: \"Why would you ever pay 10\u20ac for a real skin, if i can get a custom skin for free, even the same exact skin, the only diffence is that the enemy sees them too. Do you really want to spend 10\u20ac to be cool in the eyes of other people?\" \n\nDon't look at my account now, i paid a lot to look cool",

Being really good at one thing will always be better than being decent in many. This will also help you get more awareness of the map since you don't need to focus on your champion as much. For most champions you will find beginner friendly guides on YouTube so you should definitely look them up. A positive mental attitude will also improve your performance don't forget that! Good luck!",

You want to get comfortable so that you don't have to focus all your brain power on just piloting your character.\n\nIf you feel like you're now comfortable with the general gameplay, you can try playing ARAMs to get familiar with the many characters in the game since you'll be interacting with them way more.\n\nAnd remember most important of all: Have fun, if you don't then it's pointless!",

These are the people who will give you shit so just know that a very sad and pathetic person is on the other side when it happens.",

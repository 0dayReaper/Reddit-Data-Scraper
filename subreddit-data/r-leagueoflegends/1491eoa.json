Even in Platinum there are people who miss out on opportunities for a free gank because they dont realize the wave is coming back to their laner.",

Most of the time they will go from bottom to top and then get scuttle or gank top. Itemize based on your and the enemy team comp. \n\nPlay a lot to get a sense for what the enemy jungler might be up to. \n\nWard enemy jungle entrances or objectives. If you decide to get sweeper use pink wards for this.",

Just try to look for dia/masters players and guides. Play a few games watch a video, play a few more watch another video. \n\nGetting good habits in the start is really important. Getting new habits is easy but old habits are hard to get rid of. \nPlay all the different roles and a lot of different champs to get a feel of what they do and what they think of and why they think that.\nYi is fine in low ranks but the higher you go the worse he becomes",

            "comment": "There's a lot of abuse the jungler gets. Mute /all chat. Of course, mastering jungle clear and timing can only help you be the better jg. Stick to things that makes sense like try to gank when an enemy is close to tower, or enemy is low, or top-mid matchup is good for your allies so try to focus on bot, or recall when nothing to do. If you're confused, ask yourself why it makes sense. It's not that hard even, you will see these patterns repeat over and over with experience. \n\nDon't waste time ganking the impossible, you thinking it's impossible doesn't make IT though. Think rationally. Don't save your ult, smite or ghost/flash/ignite (unless ofc the enemy has some special ability), always use it when ganking to secure kills.\n\nMaster your jungle clear to the point where you can do it out of muscle memory while thinking about tracking the enemy jg or information about the game. You'll inevitably develop this through experience, it's not that hard once you jump the gap from thinking to muscle memory.\n\nLastly, Because your the jungler. Don't be afraid to spam ping your laners for objectives. Yi can clear baron by himself, so focus on getting all objectives. Don't focus on spoonfeeding your teammates, focus on being the better jungler and staying ahead. Good luck",

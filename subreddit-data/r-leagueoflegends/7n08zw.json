During this match there were four players who paired as two duos, popped into each other (now they control both teams ff's). By the time anybody realized what was happening, the duos were farmed enough to 2v3. So whenever a team went to end, they would communicate to their friends on the enemy team and prevent a team from ending the game. \n\nI've learned that this is something they've planned and executed before: https://twitter.com/mordeeasy2getlp/status/936469118097571840\n\nand that Riot actually encountered this game and didn't look into any possibility of collusion. In fact, they arguably celebrated this here: https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2017/11/ask-riot-longest-game-ever/\n\nHere's their youtube upload of the prior colluded game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahxwlzP0FX0\n\nI just have no idea what i'meant to do against such organized and dedicated griefing. I can't submit a ticket, i'll just get told to report them in post-game and they do the usual nothing about a ticketed complaint. So I need to get to end screen to report them. Oh btw, the client has bugged on end screen and i'm stuck at \"skip waiting for stats\" so now I can't even report them.",

It then goes to someone who has a higher again tribunal mmr and they vote too. If the votes are all the same, it's automatically conducted. If it's different, but the higher tiers agree where the lower tier voted the opposite, it goes in favour of the higher tier judgement, and if the top two tier players disagree on their verdict, it goes to a second player of the 3rd tier, and then their vote is a decider.",

After about 5 minutes we decided to just leave, fuck those guys, they can enjoy farming and getting slaughtered by the enemy team for 15 minutes while we do whatever we want. \n\nIf you\u2019re gonna troll me in a game for a bit of banter with your mates, I\u2019m tapping out and you can have fun with that shit without your \u201cvictim\u201d (since at this point, I dunno who is really the one losing out most). Don\u2019t fuel their behaviour, just get out of there so they have nothing to amuse themselves with, they\u2019re hardly going to have fun farming and dying. ",

But is it worth building it into the anti-cheat system? No, \\*but stomping down on instances of 4 people putting in the effort to annoy people for hours is probably a pretty decent return on time. Do enough people do that they would face backlash for just issuing temp bans to them? I'm guessing the equations falls on the side of more than 4 people preferring not to play if they encounter those people, with the their numbers growing much faster than the number of trolls.",

Say it takes about Y minutes to investigate a game on average - that means I can roughly look into X/Y games that were longer than any others this week, which should be trivial to retrieve. So this could be done dynamically.\n\n\nOf course that's the most brain-dead way to go about this. You could then filter games by queue type and other factors. Additionally, you could also search through a reasonable sample size of the longest games played per time period and flag players/IPs present in a certain number of them. This would be highly indicative of foul play and would probably suffice to make an attempt at solving this issue without wasting precious man hours. I'm willing to bet that Riot can quickly engineer a better solution than an idiot like me.",

We have a smaller playerbase therefore we have less 'good players', which is why we don't have a good competitive scene. \n\nNo-one is going to funnel money and time into a region that has less playerbase than less than half of another major region. We will never completely grow in a competitive sense because there's no effort being put towards it.\n\nThey made a dire wolves icon because they are our representatives, they are all good players who have high ratings on any server they go to - and top the leaderboard on OCE because its their closest server.\n\nOCE is far from the worst region, everyone just likes to say it is.",

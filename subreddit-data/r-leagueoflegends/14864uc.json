    "postText": "I am not a big fan of lol before, but my roommates in university always invite me to play. I suppose this game was a little bit complex for me, so I brought the simplest legend Malphite. Does anyone can tell me combos and outfits of Malphite due to I always die on top laner. Also, I have no idea about ward\uff0cI don't want to waste my money to buy ward.",

            "comment": "Play whatever character you like. It doesn't matter, you are a new player. Take things at your own pace.\n\nWhat I would recommend would be looking up what are the most popular builds for the character at websites like [u.gg](https://u.gg) or [op.gg](https://op.gg), and then literally only reading. Read what each rune does, each item does, what your abilities do, how do they scale up. You can literally copy builds and rune pages that people use, what's important is to know why and what those things do for your character.\n\nWhat you need is to grasp the game. It's gonna get so much easier once you understand how things work. You can figure things out yourself by then.",

Look up the current best item build and be ready to adapt. If your opponent does magic damage, don't rush armor as your first item, but magic resist.  \n\nIf you want to learn quickly, Skill Capped LoL has great, very condensed videos on the basics of LoL as well as top lane, laning, trading etc. You have picked a great champion as your first one, I wish I did that too, 10 years ago.\n\nRegarding wards, basic wards (yellow trinket) are free but last only 90 s. Control wards last indefinitely but are visible to everyone and cost 75 gold. High level players often buy a control ward every time they back to base.",

            "comment": "Top lane is probably the worst lane for a new player to be in. It\u2019s a hard lane, very punishable and the place that smurfs like to play the most because once you get a lead it\u2019s almost impossible for the other player to recover.\n\nThat said, play malphite mid or even as support. This will give you more room to learn how to ward and how to use your abilities because you won\u2019t be dead constantly.",

                            "comment": "Yea, all the 1v1 mechanics are much more relevant in the top lane. I would never recommend a new player to main top lane. My advice would be to play a bunch of the other lanes, jungle heavily advice. And once you have a decent understanding of how the rest of the map works you go top lane (by this point, hopefully, you\u2019ll adquirir decent micro mechanics as well to be able to duel).\n\nAnd still, it\u2019s going to be tough. Because top lane is very match up knowledge dependent. So you\u2019ll need to learn, by experience, how top lane champions work (powerspikes, cds, etc). And then you get matched against Vayne top and feel miserable because your jungle will never punish the feeble adc top constantly pushing the wave. But that\u2019s top lane life for you.",

            "comment": "&gt;  I always die on top laner. \n\nTop lane is a shithole, not good for a new player. It is isolated, and tends to have painful rock-paper-scissors matchups where one person just stomps the other due to their champion countering, and encourages new people to overextend and get wrecked by the jungler over and over.\n\n&gt; Malphite\n\nHis kit may be simple, but i would still not recommend him to a new player. He is basically a strategic weapon - his existence and ult (which is most of his strength) force the other team to play around it, and if you are inexperienced, you will never be in the right place to threaten with your ult, or wont use it effectively in fights. Malphite does not win lane fights, except against some specific champions who just cant damage him.\n\n&gt; I don't want to waste my money to buy ward.\n\nJust reliably using your free, recharging wards will be better than about 75% of players ever manage.\n\nLearn where to put them for various types of play so you can see incoming jungler ganks or what is going on at the boss pits.",

Out of these Morde is most fun imo. Nasus, Sion and Cho'Gath scale infinitely, meaning they become stronger the longer the game goes.",

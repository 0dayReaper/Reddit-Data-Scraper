    "postText": "I get it. I dont have friends and thats why its my fault that Im getting paired up with those groups. \n\nBut I dont understand whats going on in their minds? \n\nI tried multiple ways, playing Solo in FlexQ, finding a group of 4 via LeagueDiscord.. and its still always the same?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFew days ago: \n\nI played Clash with 4 people from league Discord. Illaoi Toplane. Hullbreaker Demolish. All lanes losing but me. First herald I took solo. 2nd Herald I took solo but jungle picks it up and places it midlane straight away. Doesnt even get T1. I ask why, as I could have pushed top Inhib / pressure for them to get drake. No flame, just  \"Man why?\" in calm voice. Guy tries to argue, I tell him I dont want to argue about it, lets focus. He kicks me out of voicecall, all premades flame me in text chat. Dont want to surrender Game2 \"for the points\". We win it (me still not in voicecall, they still flaming me in text up to a point where I mute them, all I say all game is \"nice\" when we win teamfights or take herald/drake etc. Everyone did good game, no soloCarry or anything. Pretty chill for what happened before. Then they instantly surrender clash after we got back to lobby, sending me Discord DMs like \"Ok you are right with herald, but at least we dont have to look for people because unlike you, we have friends!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother game today with 4 randoms, 3 of which are premade: \n\nMy ADC died, I have enough Damage to do drake but need a tank. Fiddle (enemy jg) top, enemy bot recalled after killing ADC. Leona (full hp/mana) collects fruit in river(why?). Runs in circles. Ultimately ends up leading -now back on lane- enemy bot+recalled jungler from blue buff (red side) to me. I die, we lose drake, fiddle clears my whole botside jungle. We play but ofc im behind. Cant gank because every lane pushing, ofc against fiddle keeps end up dying. They (the 3 premade, leona, adc, mid) start to flame me and end up surrendering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike, dont get me wrong. Everyone has bad games. I do too. This is not to rant about one specific game or whatever. But games like those two always keep up happening to me. I could list many more examples. And I get that SoloQ is better place for me playing alone. But what is it with premades? Why do so many think just because they are in a group they are free of fault or whenever you lose its the fault of the single guy in the game? Or is it just me that has this \"premade-experience\" again and again? Im not one to hide from citique. If im shit you can tell me. I can stand that. But what is the point of such behavior as mentioned?",

They always have a reason why they lost, and a reason to why they should just accept what happened and move on. It might be a broken champ, a bug, a roam/gank, or just being outplayed. If you\u2019re in a premade, you don\u2019t that to other ppl. Top went 0/3 in lane? That\u2019s just Dave having a rough game and sure the enemy laner can 1v3 but the team should be able to deal with it. Rando makes a bad play? Then they\u2019re just inting. Rando calls out your bad play? They\u2019re being aggressive and don\u2019t understand. And sadly there\u2019s a much higher chance for the solo player to be blamed.",

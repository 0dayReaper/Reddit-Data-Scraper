            "comment": "\"Okay, you're on the weak side. But don't worry, Daddy loves you. Just flop around a lil and I'll chuck some potions your way. Okay buddy? We're gonna make you nice and strong\".\n\nASSFACE sighed in relief. Coaxing Magikarp to participate in battles tended to raise ASSFACE blood pressure ever since there were news of members of Team Rocket being blown into the distance by a disgruntled freshly evolved Gyrados. ASSFACE quite liked being in one piece.  \n\n\nMagikarp started at ASSFACE blankly. Which was the most emotions ASSFACE ever got from the puny looking fish. Ah well. Soon ASSFACE would have a stronger Pokemon, one that could handle even battling the fourth gym which had a lot of grass type Pokemon.   \n\n\nThe Youngster ASSFACE was battling screamed something about a \"top 1% Rattata\" or something. Whatever. Rattatas weren't that scary. A perfect opponent for Magikarp to get some battle experiences.\n\nRattata quickly took the initiative and dashed in, leaving bite marks on Magikarp! Shit, okay that was one fast rat. ASSFACE quickly yeeted a potion like a grenade at the Magikarp, healing the bitemarks.  \n\n\n\"HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\" screamed the Youngster.   \n\n\nUh? Why was the kid so damn mad. Did he not have money for his own items? ASSFACE shrugged. He let Magikarp tank another hit before quickly swapping out for a Charizard who then proceeded to fire blast Rattata leaving a smell of cooked rat behind.   \n\n\nYoungster came storming up to ASSFACE. \"ITEMS ARE CHEATING!\". \n\n\"Says who?\" Assface retorted. \n\nYoungster stuttered for a bit. Out of the shadows came out a Grunt who sniggered.   \n\n\n\"Actually yeah that fella's right. Nothing in the Poke Code about not using items. Don't hate the playa, hate the game\" oozed out of the Grunt's shit smelling mouth. ASSFACE covered his mouth. Seriously, why did this creepy looking guy have to come over? Is he into kids?  \n\n\nASSFACE placed his hand on his pokeball, preparing to battle again. \"WAIT WAIT WAIT\" screamed the Grunt. \"Just wanted to make you an offer... We could always use more people like you... people who would do anything to win\". \n\nASSFACE threw out his Charizard again. Charizard used Fire Blast which was super effective on the creepy Grunt, sending the Grunt into the sky.   \n\n\n\"Nothing personal kid. Smell ya later\" ASSFACE chuckled and walked away from the crying Youngster.",

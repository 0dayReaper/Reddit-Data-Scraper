            "comment": "One moment, I was sitting in my room watching Youtube; the next, I was standing next to a massive banquet table in a circular room with nine other kids my age, looking just as confused as I was. The table had dozens of dishes on it, filled with more food than any buffet I had ever visited.\n\n\u201cWelcome, ladies and gentlemen!\u201d, a loud voice rang out. We all looked up to see a boy watching us from a balcony on the other side of the room. He didn\u2019t look that much different from us if you ignored the green snake eyes that he had and the curled horns on either side of his head. He clapped his hands together and started floating in the air. \u201cWelcome to the 2020 Superpower Feast. Please select a food in front of you and I\u2019ll give you a superpower based on that food!\u201d\n\nWe all stared at him for a few moments, too stunned to say anything. Then, one girl with brown curly hair spoke up. \u201cAre you saying...are you telling us that you\u2019re the one giving 16 years old superpowers every decade?\u201d she asked in a dazed voice.\n\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s me,\u201d he replied with a sly grin. \u201cOf course, I make sure to always wipe their memories before they leave this place.\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d he said, looking around at all of us. \u201cWho wants to go first?\u201d\n\nThere was a tense silence for several moments. The boy yawned. \u201cWell, don\u2019t all volunteer at once.\u201d His voice took on a more serious edge. \u201cBut, really, do choose something before I get bored and choose a grateful group of teenagers that does want superpowers.\u201d\n\nOne boy wearing glasses slowly walked over to the banquet table. We all watched him nervously as he picked up a plate that contained several slices of steak and began eating from it. Suddenly, we heard him gasp. Before, he had been fairly skinny. But now, right in front of our stunned eyes, massive muscles were appearing all over his arms and legs. The boy floating over us smiled and clapped his hands. Both the boy in glasses and the plate of half eaten steaks vanished from the room. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him,\u201d he said, gazing down at us. \u201cI just sent him back to Earth. He\u2019ll wake up, thinking that he was blessed with superpowers while he was sleeping. He giggled. \u201cWell, who\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nI raised my hand. \u201cYou said that we can eat anything from this table and we\u2019ll get a superpower from it, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s right,\u201d he said, floating over to me. \u201cSo, what do you want?\u201d\n\nI walked over to one corner of the banquet table, readied my nerves and bit into the table. I could feel everyone staring at me. I looked up at the floating boy and for the first time, I saw him look just as baffled as everyone in the room. \u201cWhat...what are you doing? \u201c he asked, tilting his head.\n\n\u201cYou said that we choose anything from the table. Well, I\u2019m choosing the table then.\u201d\n\nThere was a tense silence as we stared at each other. For a moment, I was worried that I had offended him. Then, he started laughing hysterically. \u201cMy gods, I forget how crazy you humans can be sometimes.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said with a devilish grin. \u201cYou can certainly eat the table if you want. But you have to actually swallow part of it. A simple bite isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\nI nervously gulp. It takes fifteen minutes of me constantly stabbing the table corner with a fork before part of it breaks off. The entire time, I can feel the rest of the kids looking at me, probably thinking that I\u2019m a fool or a lunatic. But I\u2019ve already committed to this. It\u2019s too late to back off down. I put the piece in my mouth. It\u2019s even more disgusting than I imagined, foul and rotten with sharp edges poking into  my gums. But, I manage to swallow it without vomiting.\n\n\u201c.Well, well, well,\u201d the boy says, smirking. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the first person in 500 years to consider eating the table. I think that such creativity deserves a unique reward, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d\n\nHe slowly descended from the air until his feet touched the ground. He pulled out a red book from his jacket pocket and handed it over to me. \u201cOnly you will be able to read this. Do take good care of it. I have a feeling that you\u2019re going to be very interesting to watch indeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d, I asked, struggling to talk against the waves of nausea coming from my stomach.\n\n\u201cMy cookbook,\u201d he said, laughing, before clapping his hands together.\n\nEdit: Parts 2 and 3 are down below!",

                    "comment": " I was originally only going to write a Part 2, but it seems that I hit the character limit, so I'm making a Part 3 as well\n\nPart 2\n\nI woke up, startled, in my chair. My first thought was that I must have fallen asleep at my desk and dreamed the whole thing. I certainly wasn\u2019t feeling nauseous anymore. But then, I saw it, the red cookbook resting next to my laptop.\n\nI stared at it for a few moments, struggling to accept what I was seeing. Then, I snatched the book up and immediately started paging through it. I was supposed to be working on my U.S. history paper, but who cares about any of that when you have a recipe book for superpowers right in front of you?\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the book was that it was very old. Which makes sense if it belonged to that boy that claimed to be over five centuries old. The pages were yellowed and close to falling out of their bindings, the ink was fading away in multiple areas and even the cover was crumbling away at the edges. The second thing I noticed was that I couldn\u2019t take photos of it. I tried using my phone to take pictures of the pages in case the book suddenly vanished on me, but in every photo, the pages appeared blank. I guess he wasn\u2019t kidding when he said that I would be the only person able to read it. So, I did read it for the rest of the night. \n\nThere were over 250 recipes in the cookbook, each for a different superpower. Some of the ingredients seemed like they would be extremely difficult to obtain. I can\u2019t imagine the average 16 year old being able to get their hands on uranium powder or the ground up remains of a tooth of a king. But other ingredients were much more common, things you could find in an average supermarket. Slowly, a plan began forming in my mind. I had to test this book, to make sure that floating boy wasn\u2019t just making a mockery of me. And I had to test it on someone else in case something went wrong. But who? Whoever I chose needed to be someone close to me, so I could see if they were actually developing powers. The answer came to me later as I was tossing and turning in bed, trying to sleep despite my growing excitement.",

                            "comment": " Part 3 (Final Part)\n\nThe next day was a Saturday. My parents were at work, which meant that I had the whole kitchen to myself for the day. Around 11 am, I woke up and sent a text message to my cousin Brennan, \u201cHey, do you want to hang out at my house at 2 today?\u201d\n\nHe sent one back. \u201cSure, I can come by then.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, by the way, while you\u2019re here, would you mind tasting some turnip soup I made? I\u2019m testing out a new recipe.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when do you cook?\u201d\n\n\u201cLol, gotta start preparing for college eventually, right? You up for it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t mind. Just as long as it\u2019s decent.\u201d\n\nI let out my breath in a sigh of relief. It had worked. Now, I just had to assemble my ingredients before he came. I had decided to choose the recipe for something called Underground Detection. The ingredients seemed fairly normal and unlikely to poison anybody. Also, I wasn\u2019t willing to give out any really major superpowers, until I had a better grasp on this cookbook thing. After spending an hour outside shopping, I arrived back home with a bag full of groceries, ready to see if this was actually going to work. The recipe called for very specific amounts of the ingredients in a very particular order. I doubled checked and then triple checked to make sure I had everything right. Once the soup was boiling, I turned off the stove and poured the creamy concoction into a bowl. I took a sniff. It didn\u2019t seem that appetizing, but it didn\u2019t seem that bad either for a first attempt. After that was done, I gathered all of the leftover ingredients and stuffed them into my closet. I didn\u2019t need my parents asking questions about why I had wasted money on buying stuff like chicken broth, acorns, potato extract, paprika or pumpkin seeds.\n\nAt two pm, Brennan showed up as he promised. I welcomed him in and walked over to the kitchen. \u201cWell, here it is. Have a taste,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice casual. I fidgeted nervously as I watched him drink the whole bowl. In truth, I don\u2019t know what I was really expecting, but I was expecting *something*. Instead, he just put the bowl down and licked his lips. \u201cNot bad,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, you want to play Super Smash Bros Brawl now?\u201d\n\nI tried my best to put on a fake smile. \u201cSure, we can do that.\u201d The whole time, I kept watching him from the corner of my eye, looking for anything out of the ordinary. An hour passed and I was getting increasingly frustrated now. One, because he had beat me seven times in a row. But also, because I was starting to feel like I was being made a fool of. My mind started wandering back to my history lessons. Maybe he needed a trigger. Not everybody immediately knew if they had developed superpowers. Sometimes, they needed to go through physical damage to know if they were gifted. In the past, they had used beatings. Nowadays, the government provided electric shock tests for any curious 16 year old looking to see if they had superpowers. As one might imagine, they weren\u2019t many volunteers. For a few crazy moments, I thought about knocking Brennan down the stairs and pretending that it was an accident. Then, I shook my head. No, that might cause serious damage and not prove anything. The only thing I could do now was to keep an eye on him for the next few weeks and see if anything changed.\n\nAround 5, Brennan decided to leave. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d I said as he stepped off the porch and walked across the lawn. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll -- ,\u201d his words cut off as his eyes widened and his whole body jolted. I could feel my heart skip a beat. \u201cUh...you alright there?\u201d I said to the silent figure in front of me that was staring intensely down at the lawn. For a few moments, I didn\u2019t think he had heard me. Then, he turned around to look at me, shock and confusion across his face. \u201cI can see it. I can see it underneath,\u201d he started babbling to me in a rush. \u201cThe ants, the worms, the water pipes, all of the minerals and rocks...oh my god.\u201d He looked down at his hands as though he was just seeing them for the first time. \u201cHave I had this the whole time and just never knew about it?\u201d\n\nA group of little kids riding on their scooters was staring at us from across the street. Fuck, he was causing a scene. \u201cUh, Brennan,\u201d I said nervously, my eyes darting around. \u201cCan we talk inside?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right, of course,\u201d he said, stumbling back indoors, his eyes dazed. I locked the front door and helped Brennan over to the couch. It took a while for him to calm down from the shock of realizing that he had super powers. Once he did recover though, he immediately wanted to rush back outside to see the extent of his powers. After I made sure the coast was clear of any witnesses, we walked around the neighborhood, seeing what he could detect. We learned that he could detect everything up to ten feet below the ground with no effort at all. And that if he really focused on searching for a certain substance like water or copper, he could go all the way down to around a hundred feet deep. After we were all done with our experiments, we walked back to my house, where Brennan sank back down into the couch.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d he kept saying. \u201cI mean, there are millions of 16 year olds across the world, and only around 6 or 8 of them are lucky enough to get superpowers in a decade. Never thought something crazy like that would happen to me.\u201d\n\nI nodded sympathetically while biting my lip. I had to approach this next issue carefully. \u201cAre you going to go public with it?\u201d I asked.\n\nBrennan stared up at the ceiling for a few seconds before answering. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m still coming to grips with the whole thing. I haven\u2019t even thought about that yet. But, honestly, I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s not like I could ever be a hero and I\u2019m not interested in being famous. And we both know that the government watches superpowered people like a hawk.\u201d\n\nI nod as I feel myself getting more relaxed. We had often discussed what we would do if we ever hypothetically got superpowers, so I had already been pretty sure that Brennan wouldn\u2019t go public. But, I had to make sure. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably for the best. Let\u2019s just keep this between the two of us.\u201d My eyes glanced at the clock. \u201cYour parents are going to get upset if you don\u2019t hurry back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah. My god, I just completely lost track of time,\u201d he said, getting up from my couch. \u201cI\u2019ll uhh...I\u2019ll let you know if anything changes.\u201d\n\nI watched him staring at the ground as he left. Then, as soon as he was out of sight, I ran over to my desk and pulled out the cookbook from the bottom drawer. I couldn\u2019t keep my hands from shaking. It was real, it had actually worked! A world of possibilities rested between my hands. I knew then what I was going to do. I was going to complete every single recipe in this cookbook. I wouldn\u2019t be able to complete them all in one go, of course. I would have to start off with the easy recipes, the ones with ingredients that were easy to get, and then, with the powers that I got from those recipes, I would chase after the ingredients of the harder ones. No matter how long it took though, I was determined to gain every last superpower this book had to offer me. And then, I would be the most powerful person in the world.\n\n**CIA Headquarters, Virginia**\n\nAlexander Kaminyar blinked in shock. He had just felt it, a new person had developed superpowers. But that wasn\u2019t right. Ten people had just gotten superpowers yesterday. It had always been only ten people every decade. Until now, it seemed. He walked over to a map of America. He couldn\u2019t tell exactly where the superpowered individual was, but he could feel it had happened somewhere in the northeastern portion of the United States. Which just so happened to be where another superpowered person had appeared yesterday\u2026 Alexander tapped his map. Something new was happening in the world.",

            "comment": "Due to various socioeconomic factors; 16 years ago there was an unprecedented baby boom. I was one of such born then. The rules are simple: one at a time you will approach the table and select a food from it. Upon eating the food, you will gain a power. We were told that we would have to each choose something different. \n\nI was always a patient person. Never in a rush to go anywhere or do anything. I just sat quietly watching the others rush ahead. One girl ate a cherry, and gained the ability to blend into any crowd. Like a sort of active camouflage that she could activate at will.\n\nA boy found a hot dog. He said that he didn't want to show off what power he got (although we later found out that his power wasn't too pleasant to look at). One after the other ate something. \n\nI lost count how many different foods from a wide variety of regions were there. I eventually noticed something interesting. Every so often it appeared like the table was shrinking. I started to watch it closely. \n\nA kid picked up a pie....Nothing. Then he ate a bite.\n\nIt shrank! Ever so slightly, but it did get smaller. Like it was adjusting itself for the amount of food left on it. Like it knew how much was on it. But it's just a table. It can't know; can it? \n\nBite after bite. Kid after kid. Little by little. It kept adjusting. There was never any new food being brought out. Just us kids, the food, and the table inside the room. I started to look around to see if anyone else had noticed or if the room were shrinking as well, but no one else seemed aware of the phenomenon with the table. The room was just as massive as when we had first started.\n\nWith less than 50 kids left; the table that was so massive one kid had to climb on top of it to get something or another out of the middle, now looked like a large banquet table. In what seemed like an instant, we were now down to 10 kids with a table that was about 2 feet square! I had gotten so enthralled at the strange table that I hadn't noticed just how few of us there were left.\n\nWe all formed a single file line, no reason to get into a fight like the guys that all wanted the porterhouse steak. One by one, they ate something. The guy in front of me said that he was sorry, but he had to eat something. I didn't know what he meant until I saw that there was nothing left. The table was now just the only thing left standing in the vast empty room with myself. \n\nI looked around for something to eat. Nothing. The room, much like the table before me, was bare. I called out to whoever could hear for something, but no response ever came. I had never thought that this could happen. How could this massive table, well it was, run out of food. Did someone somehow eat more than one thing? What was I supposed to do? \n\nI picked up the table, can I even still call it a \"table\"? It couldn't hold an olive on it even if it needed to. With no other option, I decided to make my final meal that table. I mean, I wouldn't live after eating a table, would I? What if it expanded out again? No. I had to eat something to leave the room. I hope that I don't get a splinter and I ate the table.\n\nUpon swallowing the table, I looked around at the room and waited. This is the room that gifted so many with amazing powers and many others with very ordinary ones. I sat down, waiting for the table to do whatever it would. Waiting to leave the room. Why was I still here? What would happen if more kids suddenly teleported into the room? I could feel myself starting to panic. Then suddenly, black.\n\nI awoke later inside my room, back at my desk where I had been studying before. I survived! The table didn't kill me. I was so happy to be out of that damn room. I looked down at my books, notepad, and pencil. Might as well finish these last few notes before class tomorrow morning. That's right. I had broken my last pencil before leaving. Now what was I supposed to do. I picked up the stub that still held the eraser on it. If only it were a bit longer I could sharpen it and finish. \n\nI stood up and went to the restroom to wake myself up a bit. Splashing some water in my face and looking in the mirror, I was happy to not have any strange difference about myself. All seemed normal. Nothing different anywhere. Satisfied, and a bit disappointed, I went back to my room. Looking back at my stuff on the desk there was my pencil. Or was that mine. It was still broken, but now it was around 3 inches long. \n\nThat's when I learned that I gained the powers of the table. What ever I needed, I could adjust as I saw fit. I would be able to work in any industry that I wanted to. Need a part changed on a vehicle, but can't get your hand into the tiny space? Just make it larger, replace the part and shrink it back down. Need a surgical device to fit in a place too small? Shrink it down. I can only wonder what the limits of this power could be.",

Men with guns and powers of fire and ice hot on my trail. \n\nJimmy, who ate the dog biscuits hidden in the corner of the table, had let that wolf familiar of his after me too. Fucking traitor! \n\nI had committed the worst transgression of our people: I didn't conform to the test and bit right into that stupid table. Jimmy was the one who dared me to and now I'm a fugitive of the village. \n\nI hit a dead end and stared at the mountain in front of me. If they catch me it's certain death. \n\nI reached deep into myself and called for whatever powers, if I obtained any, to surface and  help me.\n\nMy body stretched, my limbs twisted and as I opened my eyes I could see for miles around me. The village and forest were but mere pin pricks of lights and swaths of darkness.\n\n It had started to snow harder. Large wet flakes had started to hit my body and face. \n\n\"We lost him Captain!\" I heard a distant voice yell. \n\nAt a height of at least 200 feet I seen the hunting party close around me and stop. They stared at me from the base with a look of horror and confusion. \n\nI've never been good with geography or plants, but I knew enough to know what I've transformed into. \n\nOne came towards me at a slow pace and put a hand one me, marveling at the sheer size I've become. \n\nJimmy came forward, his wolf growling in my direction with his ears back and fur tufted. \n\nThe last thing I heard before I willed myself to fall on to the hunting party was the lone pitiful voice of my friend calling out in disbelief, \" IS THAT A FUCKING SEQUOIA?!\"\n\nI am The Arborist.",

Opening his eyes after chewing the harsh texture for a moment, he noticed how many eyes were on him.\n\n\"...What? What's wrong?\" He asked.\n\nNo one said anything. Some of them still sat there dumbfounded, a look of shock across their features.\n\n\"Is... Is there something on my face?\"\n\n\"The fuck??\" One of them responded. Carl himself was levitating nearby in an attempt to get a better look. He'd eaten grapes the first time around. And now, to Kevin's chagrin, he could fly.\n\n\"What??\" Kevin asked them all again.\n\n\"What're you eating the *table* for?!\" Carl pointed out hastily.\n\nSandra yawned nearby and excused herself as a small ball of flame rolled out of her mouth. Jalapenos had been her ticket.\n\n\"I just wanted to see what would happen.\"\n\n\"Bro, you gotta eat the food. You eat the food to get a superpower! Just pick something! Stop it.\"\n\nKevin considered this as he kept chewing. \"Eh, no sense in backing out now...\"\n\n\"Goddamn it Kev.\" Sandra said as she palmed her head at her friend's idiocy.\n\nThe sorcerer meant to monitor such a thing, Iliana, still watched in sheer amusement. Maybe it was the way he'd done it. Or just the sheer stupidity. Either way, she was having a great time.\n\n\"You gonna have splinters.\" Carl cringed as Kevin crunched more down.\n\n\"Eh it's more grainy then anything.\" Kevin shrugged. \"Kind of bland. Anybody got some hot sauce or something?\"\n\n\"Man you're sick.\" Someone else commented.\n\n\"Dude, I remember you said you ate crayons as a kid.\" Sandra added again. \"But this isn't it.\"\n\n\"It tastes better than it should be.\" Kevin said after adding Sriracha to the piece he'd broken off to eat.\n\nIliana had heard of this only once before. And it fascinated her to see it take place. Others didn't comprehend it. People looking for answers hadn't understood the smile slowly creeping across her face.\n\n\"At least look out for nails or something.\" Carla said as he tried to get Kevin to stop.\n\n\"Man's got a mouthful of bricks.\" Someone cackled as he watched the human rendition of a woodchuck continue his work.\n\n\"Enough.\" Iliana said as she stood. \"It is done.\"\n\n\"What? I'm done?\" Kevin said.\n\n\"Yes. You've gained a power very few manage to obtain.\"\n\n\"...And that would be?\" He asked after her silence.\n\nIliana glided around the table, her robes trailing behind her as she approached him. Kevin stopped chewing only to look up at her. The dagger she suddenly jammed into his ribs caused the room to panic, the horror encompassing all as they watched.\n\n\nBut Kevin didn't die. He had barely reacted to the move as the others screamed. Iliana pulled the dagger back to reveal the metal had bent to the point of being unusable.\n\n\"Invulnerability.\" She smiled. \"Well done.\"\n\n\"But... but...\" Sandra asked. \"He ate the table.\"\n\nIliana explained it with gusto many had yet to see. \"Whatever you take a bite of gives you your gift. We didn't say it was just the food.\"\n\n\"...So does this mean I can finish this? Or?\" Kevin asked after he put more Sriracha on the wood he had left.\n\n---\n\nFeedback and criticism are welcome! r/Jamaican_Dynamite",

            "comment": "(I don't usually write for these so be gentle)\n\nThe day finally came. It was my turn like my brother and sister before me. They each got their powers and now have been assigned jobs that took advantage of their powers.\n\nMy brother with his super strength works in a foundry lifting heavy materials. While my sister with her healing powers works in the local hospital. Both are super happy with their lives mostly.\n\nSome of my older friends have their powers as well. Some are really cool and useful like my siblings. Some aren't as useful like my friend who got super speed typing.\n\nNow it was my turn. The elders and trainers looked on in the room we were all in. Every power had a specific trainer. Their job was to make sure you learned how to use your powers correctly. Everyone had to walk up to what they were gonna eat. Then we all took a bite at the same time. \n\nUsually a bit of hell broke loose for a moment as people got used to their new abilities. Some things let you even morph into animals! I wouldn't mind that one. You get to work at the zoo as an exhibit.\n\nWe then heard the 1 minute warning. We all got ready to take a bite out of our food. Except me, I hadn't picked anything yet. I quickly thought about the different foods as time was being counted down. If you didn't take a bite out of something you'd be a \"normie\" or \"PL\" a powerless individual. That's not something you want. Then I heard the count down and panicked. I kneeled down and when I heard \"Bite!\" I took a bite out of the table. \n\nI heard a few gasps from the elders and trainers. I did something never done before. See what we didn't know was that every food had been prepared by the trainers according to a special recipe and that's how their powers were passed on during this short window in our life. However, no one could remember who on earth made the table. It had always been there since the beginning.\n\nAs other people's powers came forth and the elders were dealing with that, one came up to me and asked how I was feeling. \"Nothing has happened yet. So I don't know.\" I said to them. \"Well it can take some time to manifest. Go get some water and splash some on your face. See how you feel.\" they replied.\n\nSo I went to the bathroom and splashed some water on my face. As I was calming down I was reminded of a rain storm when I was younger. The water splashing on my face made me remember it. All of a sudden I heard rain outside and a voice in my head say \"Command accepted. Altering weather to rainstorm.\"\n\nI froze. Where did that voice come from? I then thought about sunny weather instead to see if I could get it to come back. I heard it again \"Command accepted. Altering weather to calm and sunny. Average temperature.\". What was this I thought to myself. Then I heard a reply that scared me \"Welcome back Superuser. Root command access granted. Account Deity reactivated.\"\n\nAn elder I hadn't seen previously came and found me at the sink and said \"We need to talk about your new power. There's only supposed to be one of us at time. You weren't supposed to take a bite out of my table ya goof.\" with a smile on his face. \"Come now. You have a lot to learn so I can finally die in peace.\"",

A cut of ham or a slice of pie. Not me. They all got the powers you'd expect. Healing from the apple or fire from those hot peppers. That type of thing. \n\nI bit the table. Just a big old chunk out of a mahogany table, teeth be damned.\n\nAt first, the council gave me a look that could say nothing other than *what the actual fuck*. And then it dawned on them, about as quickly as it dawned on me. \n\nI wasn't the weirdo anymore. I wasn't the outcast. \n\nI looked at Barry. Oh, Barry. He'd bullied me relentlessly for years, and he'd just grabbed one of those peppers and was preparing to light my pants on fire in front of all my peers. \n\nWe couldn't have that now, could we? I channeled my power, not that I had any idea what it'd be. Maybe I'd start flying, high enough to avoid the flames licking towards me. Maybe I'd explode something and cause enough of a distraction.\n\nBarry huffed and puffed--he knew exactly what his power was supposed to be. But no flame came. Not even a wisp of smoke. Stupid as I might have looked biting the table, he looked even more a blowhard as he tried and tried but failed miserably.\n\n\"What's happening?\" he cried, looking towards the council. \n\nThey knew no better than anybody else. But as they thought, using the wisdom bestowed upon them by their bite of the olives, their careful trains of thought derailed and turned to muddled nonsense. \n\nI'd done away with their powers, just like I had with Barry's. The table gave, and the table took away.\n\nThat was the power of the table that I'd bit a chunk out of. All of their powers were propped up by mine. And I didn't want them to have any power at all.\n\n****\n\nThanks for reading! If you enjoyed this, please check out more stories at r/MatiWrites.

Because it only works if I have a timer set. No timer? I have no goddamn idea how long it's been. You'll look in the oven and shit will be half cooked or burned, you'll check the laundry and it's got ten minutes to go, you have to be out of the house on time? Fuck it you're late.

Everyone that is except the hero of the story, who seems to have born without any magic ability at all (and is brutally bullied by some kids with magic talents).  His mom can reverse time in small areas (but only by ten seconds) and his father has an incredibly strong paralysis talent, so why didn\u2019t he inherit any magic at all?!\n\nNote the author wrote a ton of sequels, but I think the best books by far are the first and the third one (Castle Roogna).  You can skip the second one in my opinion and miss out on little.",

In *A Spell for Chameleon* if you don't show a magic talent by a certain age, you are exiled to \"dreary mundania\" through the barrier that kills you if it's not deactivated. They mention one guy didn't have to show the whole village after getting a certified note from the Magician of Information (has the answer you need to everything, if you pay his price) who was allowed to stay, and he had a fairly useless power (changing the color of his urine).\n\nTalents are also unique, although some can have similar results (One was a set of siblings, one could change her own hair, the other anyone else's hair).",

Offer me what's behind door number 1, you better believe I'm opening door number 2.\n\nTake me to a small room and show me a table covered in food?\n\nOh, I know what's up.\n\nThe food is trash, a diversion.\n\nIt's the table. That's the good stuff.\n\nUnder the duck l'orange, apple pie, and foie gras, there's a table made of the most succulent, delicious, textured maplewood I've ever seen. And who knows, this wood just might give me the greatest superpower of them all. Dimensional manipulation or something. It's possible. This is the magic 16-year-old teleportation room. In here anything goes.\n\nSo I sweep the food off the table and crouch by the corner.\n\nThe wood is there in front of me. It's rough. Never been sanded or polished. I can already imagine what all that texture will feel like on my tongue. I just know it's going to be divine.\n\nI brace my hands to either side of the corner, open my mouth wide, and, with a sudden snap like a viper's strike, I bite the wood.\n\nWhat follows is a pain like nothing I've ever experienced. I'm pretty sure every one of my front teeth has fallen out of my head. I want to cry, but the pain is so bad and my face is so squinched that tears can't make it out of my tear ducts.\n\nI'm in this state of hurt and confusion when the reverse teleportation kicks in and deposits me back at my 16th birthday party. All my friends and family are there. Their eyes go wide when they see me.\n\nThrough my tears I ask, \"What are you looking at?\"\n\nMy sister opens a pocket mirror and holds it up to me.\n\nPrinted in bright red letters across my forehead are the words:\n\nTABLE-BITING IDIOT\n\n*****\n\n*r/TravisTea*",

            "comment": "Through the years the great coming of age feast was always looked forward to by everyone. Every power was known due to having being tried at least once and due to variety of different cultures. The people all knew very well what they know they will get before hand. Some families pick a food that is their traditional choice, others break this tradition with a choice of their own. One thing is for certain, it is only you that is teleported to that room when your time comes. There are others with your same birthday but it is just you with that whole table alone.\n\nThe apples gave superhuman endurance and speed. The fish gave superhuman intelligence. Carrots gave superhuman vision. Bread gave you limitless wealth. Other things have more complex superpowers. The more ingredients there were the more complex or the more mixed your powers became. Chicken noodle soup gave heat vision, x-ray vision, laser eyes, super endurance, flight, and telekinesis. \n\nIt is your turn to go and you disappear into the room. Time nearly stands still until your choice is made to pick the food you want. The room is dimly lit with an unknown source of light above it. The table is wooden and looks nearly mid 1300 century with hand made rivets holding the table in place. The table is surrounded by similarly looking wooden chairs at each end and a bench on both of the longer sides. The centerpiece is a beautiful combination of plants that make it almost look like Thanksgiving. Surprisingly, there are no plates on the table just the food and the table. The soups were contained in a bowl but we're over flowing the bowls they were contained in.\n\nYou chuckle as you know there are a few people that have bitten the centerpiece. The power they received is interesting they can shape shift from looking like different people to even different objects. This power is very useful with spies and it is fully taken advantage of in many espionage operations. \n\nYou sit at the end of the table pondering about which one to pick. You jump between them all after a while you notice something. Everyone has made a choice with everything. You can name all the powers by heart just by looking at each food but one mystery remains to you. What powers does the table give? \n\nYour choice is made and you can tell what you want. It won't taste good but the table is the choice you made. Your curiosity has caught a hold and now you bend over to take that bite. Just as your mouth hits it, you are met with a complex set of flavors. It tastes like everything on the table and some flavors you can't even recognize. The flavor in your mouth turns to burning and then you feel a cool rush hit over your body as you disappear from the room. \n\nYou are returned to your class where you wonder if anything even changed. Your friends stare at you in hopeful wonder as they wait for you to tell what you picked. Many people were hoping you would pick the pot roast since it has some of the most desired powers to it. You try to muster something up but you can't figure how to or if you even have anything to summon upon. You shrug as you explain that you bit the table. Everyone of your friends laugh uncontrollably with disbelief. You feel like you kind of wasted your time but you thought it was a smart choice given the situation. \n\nSuddenly it hit you, the force of all the knowledge in the universe, all the powers ever received from the table and more. Time is irrelevant to you as you can see things way far into the future and things way far into the past. All while staying exactly where you are. You become omnipotent and can give and take superpowers at will just like the table does. \n\nYour friends see almost a galaxy glowing in your eyes as you finally know the purpose of the table and the food. The purpose was to test humanity with temptation while also having every power put in front of their faces. Just like you never judge a book by it's cover. With all this knowledge you finally snap out of it to go back to your math test in class happily writing out the answers as quickly as possible since you are omnipotent you do even look at the paper to complete the test as you teleport it in immediately to the teacher. There are many more important things to do but school comes first and you have unlimited amounts of time now.",

Like his father and grandfather, a tradition dating all the way back to his distant ancestor and founder of the first underwater city, New Atlantis.\n\nJoe hated lobster. Sure, the ability to breath under water and biological immortality were both amazing superpowers that most people would take without blinking.\nEveryone in the underwater kingdom of Oceana would eat the damn thing, or be forever trapped to live in the childrens dome.\n\nNot that people living on the surface acted any better, everyone assumed their food of the gods were the best, be it flying or whatever else the many kingdoms held in highest regard.\n\nNot that moving to the surface world would have been a possibility for Joestigar of Atlantia the next king of Oceana anyway, not with relations breaking down so much as they had. \n\n\"Shit. I really dont want to eat this lobster.\" he mumbled as he lifted the silver plate, a lemon falling to the marble floor.\n\nDaydreaming one last time of how nice it would be to tell his father to eat mud and move to the free choice colony on the south pole, he opend his mouth to take a bite, shell and all like tradition dictated...\n\nAnd bit into hard wood.\n\n\"If you are so damn unhappy about my cooking then dont eat it.\" A booming voice from behind him said. \n\nConfused and surprised, Joe took his mouth away from the table he just took a bite at, somehow, and quickly turned around. A kid about five or six years old, dressed in a dirty robe and a little apron, looking rather annoyed stood before him.\n\n\" Excuse me? \" Joe said with not a small dose of confusion and a little bit of fear, what if this little kid was some all powerful god he offended.\n\n\"I said, if you dont want to eat my food then dont eat it. Lets see if you make better food then.\" the kid said, but the voice did not match the apperance. It sounded far away and much older.\n\n\"You took a bite from my table and now its yours, along with the job of cooking, thats how this thing works. I have been cooking ever since I turned five and got the job from the last girl. Even made serious improvements, can you believe she let five year olds choose their own food?\" the kid went on.\n\n\"Of course, back then it was no table around, just a fireplace with meat and vegetables around it. Didnt think stumbling head first into the glowing embers would land me in this position. \"\n\n\" No, I even added superpowers and let you keep the memory of your visit, she never did...\" he shook his little head.\n\nJoe snapped out of his confusion,\n\n\"What do you mean the table is mine ?\" joe blurted out. Feeling blood drain from his face.\n\n\"Exactly what I said, you are now the official chef of the gods, congratulations. Your responsibilities include making the coming of age celebration for young humans, dont ask me why your new boss wants it that way, probably came up with the idea a few millenia ago for some obscure reason.\" The kid looked rather happy now, starting to remove his apron as he went on with his explenation.\n\n\"Lets talk you through your new job in the kitchen over here, comes with great benefits like unlimited powers in this space though. \"\n\nSuddenly the lobster on the floor looked rather tasty to Joe. \n\n.... \nFirst try at this\ud83d\ude42",

Immediately all eyes in the room stopped and turn to look at me, the idiot with his teeth clamped around a corner of the table.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" the voice asked again. This time quieter and with more curiosity.\n\nThe words hung in the air. All the other prospects were not longer eating, each one stood dumb with food still hanging from their mouths.\n\n\"What are you doing\" the voice had got closer. \n\nI turned my eyes to see where the voice was coming from but for some reason my teeth had locked place. I was stuck.\n\nA hand gently rested on my shoulder and the voice whispered in my ear.\n\n\"What have you done?\"\n\nMy eyes darted back and forwards trying to see who the mystery speaker was, unable to unfix my jaw from the table. As my eyes cast around the room I saw the other prospects were starting to recoil. The food in their hands and mouth was turning to ash.\n\nIt started slowly, first those closest to me noticed it. The edges of their mouths greying and starting to flake away. \n\nI panicked and started to scream into the wood as I saw more and more of the youths droop and flake into ashen clouds. All my voice could manage was a muffled moan. The hand on my shoulder was gripping tighter and tighter. The yells and shouts of those around me filled me ears. It seemed to last forever and I clenched my eyes shut, trying to drown it out.\n\n\nSilence \n\n\nThe hand on my shoulder felt lighter and I looked to see a whisper of grey ashes pass my eyes from where it had been. A disembodied voice whispering.\n\n\"What have you done\"",

            "comment": "The room turns to look at me with what I can only describe as the faces of complete disbelief, can't imagine why.  I mean, surely taking a bite of air would give people invisibility, eating an apple might give healing, and steak would give super strength.  But what would a bite of the table give?  They may look at me like I'm some sort of psycho, but I think we all know who the real genius here is.\n\nWe wait for everyone to take a bite of something, and of course most people go for the most luxurious dishes.  No one with a power is allowed to say what exactly they took a bite of, so we just have to guess, and I suppose everyone thinks it must be something expensive.  But wouldn't that be what everyone goes for?  And yet, we don't have that many super powerful supers around.  I think those all-powerful ones thought outside the box.\n\nFinally, everyone has finished, and we're brought into a room full of people in suits, who I can only imagine have been surveying is through the cameras hidden throughout the room.  They take each individual into a separate room to tell them what they ate, and why that gave them their superpower.  Finally, they get to me.\n\n\"Right this way-\" a short, scrawny man beckons me into one of the soundproof rooms.\n\n\"Let's see...\" He begins, glancing at the notes on his clipboard.  \"Oh.  You're the one who ate the table-\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"If I may ask,\" he lowers his glasses, and gives me a weird look.  \"Why?\"\n\n\"Curiosity.  Everyone's tried the fruits and expensive dishes on the table.  Heck, I'm sure some brave souls were willing to take a bite of the clearly poisoned cheese in the rat traps on the floor.  But no one's tried the table, I'm sure.  I want to be different than everyone else- unique.  Even if I get the lamest power anyone's ever had, at least it'll be something new.\"\n\n\"Well, I can assure you it won't be lame...\" The man seemed satisfied with my answer.  \"You see- I came up with what power we'd give to those who tried the actual table... No one thought anyone would ever, well, *try* it.  So I was given clearance to come up with any ability, no matter how powerful.  You're ability... is terraforming.\"\n\n\"Terra- what now?\"\n\n\"Well, it's impossible to eat the floor, and putting a pile of dirt on the table was just too obvious... So I figured the table made the most sense...\"\n\n\"Sure, sure, yeah that's great and all.  But what exactly *is* my ability?\"\n\nHe leaned in closer, \"You have the power to move the Earth itself.  You can shape continents, lift entire cities, if you train well enough- It's not something to be taken lightly.\"\n\n\"Wait, really?  So you mean, I am capable of moving buildings through moving the ground under them, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, but sir--\"\n\n\"So I can move my Papa's Pizza right next to my house!  I normally have to drive an hour to get there, but now!  Now, it could be right next door!  Or maybe, I could just move my house over there... I own the land, so I couldn't get sued--\"\n\n\"Sir...\" His expression changes to that of sheer disappointment. \"You can't just- I mean... Nevermind.  You- There's an academy for people with powerful abilities like you.  You're going to have to go there first-- and there are laws in place to prevent you from just doing whatever you want.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'll go to the academy or whatever-- BUT then I can find a way to 'legally' get a Papa's Pizza next door.  That is my number one priority at this time.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine...\" He sighs, \"Here, there's a car to drive you to the academy, they're already notified of your ability and your arrival.  I swear- why do I always get the crazy ones...\" He adds under his breath.",

            "comment": "I blew out the candles, and poof! I was gone. Just like I was told, there I was, in this room, alone. Just me, and a table, and way too much food.\n\nIn the centre was a roast terducken, you know them, a chicken in a duck in a turkey. A friend told me that he had taken a bite of the turkey, and had gotten stronger. Another had taken some duck, and they could fly. Another took the chicken, and they could see through the ground - because apparently that is a thing. To the left was an apple pie. I read somewhere that eating that made you absurdly good at persuasion. There were berries, and milk tart, and cheesecake, and broccoli and cauliflower, and steak and ham and Brussels sprouts, and goodness knows what else, not even counting the wine and fruit juice. \n\n\nAnd I had thought long and hard about this moment. I had decided, as my father had advised, to stuff my face with as much food as possible, like he had, and get as many abilities as possible, but I have a problem: when something gets into my head, we'll heaven help me, I have to do it.\n\nI bit the table. \n\nAt first, nothing came of it, I couldn't sink my teeth deep enough, but then, it broke off just like a massive slab of chocolate, and melted away in my mouth. For about sixty seconds I was in heaven, the feeling unbearably good, and then, I was back at home.\n\n\"Well? What did you chow on?\" my father asked.\n\n\"You will know what you have immediately,\" my mother assured.\n\nI don't know if I answered. I woke up on the couch. Apparently, I had passed out, and my birthday party had moved me upstairs, before continuing without me in the backyard. But damn me, I had an urge. An urge to do... Something! Anything! I had to act. I got up, and ran to our dinner table, and bit down. It just broke off, and I ate it. Perhaps, I thought, this was becoming a pattern. Then it hit me what I had done. I had just destroyed my family's table.\n\nI paniced. You can fix stuff with noodles, right? I rushed through to the cupboard, grabbed some noodles, and smacked them onto the table. They seemed to stay, so I used my hands to smooth them out. It didn't look the same color, though, so I grabbed some of my sister's blue nail polish and painted it brown.\n\n\"Buddy?\" my friend asked, looking perplexed at me. He must have entered sometime between my table munching and my noddle smoothing. \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I'm, uh, eating noodles,\" I lied, grabbing some hard noodles from beside me and slurping it up, slapping myself in the face in the process.\n\nThey stood critically at the door. \"Dude, what did you eat?\"\n\n\"I think I best not say.\"\n\nMy friend rolled their eyes. \"I just watched you turn blue nail polish and noddles into the part of the table you ate. What did you eat?\"\n\n\"The table...\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know you ate the table, and then you fixed it with noodles, but what did you eat? Like, in the magic room?\"\n\n\"The table.\"\n\nMy friend face-palmed harder than I'd ever seen anyone facepalm. \"I'm a make a wild guess; you ate a piece of the table itself on a whim, and now have the power that any random crap you do on a whim works!\"\n\nI pursed my lips.\n\n\"So, uh,\" my friend said, \"My birthday is next month. What do I eat when I get there?\"\n\nI grinned from ear to ear. \"The wine glass. Eat the wine glass.\"\n\n...\n\nFor more, see r/sarcastic_rambler",

What flavor *would* invisibility be?\n\n\u201cHurry it up, kid, you\u2019re not the only one who needs to do this today,\u201d says a brash security guard, opening a door to check on you.\n\nYou turn to glare at her. \u201cThis is literally going to affect the rest of my life,\u201d you say. \u201cCould I please have half a second to think about it?\u201d\n\nShe rolls her eyes and pops her gum but leaves and closes the door behind her.\n\nYou survey your options. A pile of rolled injera, an assortment of nigiri featuring every type of fish imaginable, a plate of deep-fried black pudding\u2026There were endless dishes, endless cuisines. More foods than a single person could possibly be familiar with, and more choices than a person could possibly make sense of.\n\n*Luckily, I\u2019m not here to try to get the best superpower,* you think. *All I have to do is figure out which of these options represents the biggest \u201cfuck you\u201d to whatever powers that be are making us all do this.*\n\nYou\u2019ve already given some thought to \u201cthrowing\u201d this little contest in protest, intentionally choosing something generic or boring in order to get a lame superpower. But you\u2019re not sure exactly what that would look like; how do you distinguish between unoriginal and classic, one-dimensional versus elegantly simple? Who\u2019s to say that interestingness even matters at all? A glass of still water is about as boring as it gets, but you can still see arguments for it potentially yielding several interesting superpowers; maybe the ability to breathe underwater, or to talk to aquatic animals, or, hey, even invisibility.\n\nBesides, what would throwing the contest accomplish other than crippling you with a shitty power? Lots of people end up with subpar powers, albeit unintentionally; you\u2019d hardly be the first.\n\nNo, you needed something bigger. Something that would really challenge the system, turn it upside down.\n\nYou survey the room one more time. Four walls, a ceiling, a floor. Lots and lots of food on an impossibly long table\u2026\n\nYou smile.\n\nAnd then, without further hesitation, you chomp right onto the corner of the mahogany dining table.\n\n***\n\n\u201cThis is outrageous!\u201d erupts the goddess of law. \u201cShe can\u2019t do this!\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew this would happen,\u201d says the god of prudence and restraint. \u201cHumans can\u2019t control themselves. They always have to push limits.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the girl\u2019s a genius,\u201d says the deity of wit. \u201cThe table! All these years, and we never had someone try the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the girl\u2019s an idiot,\u201d says the deity of social order. \u201cAnyone could tell the table wasn\u2019t meant as an option. What was she thinking? How absolutely absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we meant to do now?\u201d whines the goddess of law. \u201cThere\u2019s no correspondence for biting the table, no associated superpower. Every human is gifted one special ability from the gods. What will hers be?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we allow her to choose?\u201d suggests the deity of wit. \u201cSort of a reward for outsmarting the gods, so to speak.\u201d\n\nThe goddess of law opens her mouth to express vehement disapproval but is in intercepted by the god of choice. \u201cYou know full well why we can\u2019t do that. I too admire the girl\u2019s moxie, but no human is prepared to make a decision of that magnitude. That reality is why we devised this system in the first place\u2014to simplify the choice, and ease the burden of regret.\u201d\n\nAs the various deities worry and quarrel over the girl\u2019s decision, the goddess of fate, still in her security guard disguise, watches the others in amusement and noisily chews her gum.\n\n\u201cCould you please stop that?\u201d chastises the deity of social order. \u201cWhat are you smiling about? What\u2019s so funny?\u201d\n\nThe goddess of fate grins. \u201cYou\u2019re all arguing over this, but the solution is really very simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d asks the goddess of law, annoyed.\n\n\u201cThe girl will get the power that she selected,\u201d the goddess of fate says.\n\n\u201cBut she didn\u2019t\u2026there\u2019s no\u2026\u201d the goddess of law begins.\n\nThe deities look at each other.\n\n\u201cFor better or worse, she chose what she chose,\u201d the goddess of fate says. \u201cThe only logical thing to do is to honor her choice.\u201d\n\nThe other deities are silent, each considering her proposal. One by one, each gives their nod of assent.\n\nThe goddess of fate watches the girl who caused this whole debacle on a television screen displaying footage from a hidden security camera in the room of the test. \u201cGood luck, girl.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\u201c*Superpower: None?* What does that mean?\u201d reads the most recent message in your inbox.\n\nYou give a small sigh, then smile. You usually didn\u2019t notice your lack of superpower. Since everyone\u2019s ability is different, people tend to assume that they just haven\u2019t ever seen you in a situation where you\u2019d have an opportunity to use it.\n\nOf course, there was chaos at first. Your family and friends were baffled when you returned without any powers. You were a little baffled yourself; though you had made your choice quite intentionally, you really had no idea what the consequences of your decision would be. The media wrote sensationalized thinkpieces on your condition about things like whether not having a superpower in a world of superpowered people was, in fact, some kind of perverse superpower itself. Some hailed you as a maverick, while others looked upon you as a pitiful idiot. Many called you a liar, accusing you of having a power but hiding it, perhaps because it was just that fantastic.\n\nBut all in all, the more time that passed, the more that people forgot about you entirely. You faded from the public eye and went on to live a mostly normal life.\nBut still, there were cases in which it came up. Like on your online dating profile.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a power,\u201d you type.\n\n\u201c?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to remember the news story six years ago about the girl who bit the table and didn\u2019t get powers, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the girl who bit the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cHahahaha\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah\u201d You move to log off.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d\n\n\u201cwhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the girl who bit the fork.\u201d",

It could have been a plate! But I didn't want to be fragile or have China stuck in my teeth. \"There was table cloth there. That should have helped right?\" \n\nThis tired doctor, assigned to care for every newlygifted, stares blankly at my file. \n\"The problem, Sir-Ma'am-or neuter, is not the cloth-\"\n\n\"-uh my pronouns-\"\n\nCareless to my interjection the doctor threw Their glasses to Their desk. \"I do not care who you are or what you're called! You were taken to a magic room that everyone waits for- plans for their entire life. There are meals in there that are extinct now. And you ATE. THE. TABLE.\"\n\nThat's true, dodo is rumored to give you the power to see the past in visions. \n\nA heavy sigh escaped the doctor as he looks at me. \"The powers don't come from just the food. It's why you ate the food. Why, did you eat a table?\"\n\nHollow silence filled the room.  My voice seemed lodged in my throat. \n\n\"I panicked.\"\n\n\"You've planned for this day your whole life. You cannot tell me that you just, panicked.\"\n\nTrue, the room is anti anxiety, and any amount of time you spend in there is only a fraction of a second back home, there is no rush to your decision.\n\nThe doctor wouldn't look away from me. Everyone is going to be wondering what my powers are, what I ate to get them. Why I ate it. Do I even know why I ate the table?\n\n\"I wanted to know what would happen. I didn't really think I was going to bite through the table. But then it just melted like ice cream into my mouth and now you're staring me down.\"\n\nThe doctor looked down and took a few notes on my file. \"And have your powers arisen yet?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, I'd say so.\"\n\nFor the first time, curiosity and life sparked in their eyes. What was the awesome power? I could almost tell what they was thinking by the expressions on their face. Did I have super strength? Could I armor myself in wood with a single word? Could I talk to the trees now? \n\nIn answer I only leaned over, tapping their pencil gently. To watch it melt. The doctor gasped and jumped back, shaking their hand free of the now liquidized pencil. It wasn't hot, it wasn't cold. It was now, simply.. viscous. It had soaked into my file, blurring and ruining my records. Will anyone believe him. \n\nI smiled and stood, they seemed shaken. Maybe they need a glass of water. So I offered them the now solid contents of my cup. It wasn't ice. It wasn't cold. It was now like glass. Made of water. \n\nI can now control the solid or liquid state of elements around me. But will anyone believe the doctor? \n\nI smiled back at them as I left. They now have a fantastic paperweight.",

            "comment": "No one truly knew how it happened, but on a person's sixteenth birthday, they were teleported to a room. It was a small, dark room that housed a long table that was full of every food imaginable. \n\nToday was Robert's birthday. It happened in a instant; one moment, he was sitting on the couch trying to pick out which video game to play, and the next, he was standing in the room. Other teens whose birthday was that day stood alongside him.\n\nHe stared at the table in awe. Though it was said that a man instructed them on how to aquire their own superpower, they had all memorized the stories with childish glee. It was simple: eat a dish, and gain a superhuman ability. Some dishes were well-known, like spicy things giving heat-related abilities or seafood giving water-based abilities. \n\nBefore the man that ran the whole room could even begin instructing the teens, they dove in to eat. As soon as the first bite had been swallowed, they disappeared with a small flash. \n\nRobert hung back, studying the table. He had always thought of what he would want, but the choice suddenly seemed overwhelming. This would last him the rest of his life; what if he grew to hate the ability?\n\nHe wasn't alone, but, in his panicked state, he was so indecisive that he outlasted even the pickiest of eaters. When the last teen had finished swallowing, the man that ran the room let out a sigh. \n\n\"I get this every day, I swear,\" he muttered. \"Just eat, you stupid little gremlin.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Robert insisted. \"I want some amazing ability, you know?\" He stepped toward the table, studying it intently. *What is something that's* never *eaten?* His face lit up as an idea struck. \n\nHe walked up and settled down in an untouched chair. He searched for a knife, and, once he found one, began sawing at the table. Made of a simple wood, perhaps oak, although Robert was no expert, the table stood strong and proud. It took several minutes to saw at, but once it was done, Robert grinned proudly. \n\nThis would be his crowning achievement. This surely was the most creative action he could have taken, and therefore would give him an insanely powerful ability. He shoved the small piece of wood in his mouth, chewed despite the painful splinters, and forced himself to swallow. \n\nThe effect was immediate. The room brightened, and a man, a tall person with a smirking face, stood in the furthest corner. \n\nThe table disappeared along with the food. \n\n\"You know,\" the man said, \"I've never seen anyone do that before.\n\nRobert's smile widened. \n\n\"I thank you for releasing me.\" \n\nRobert paused, his smug grin disappearing. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You see, the wood does provide abilities, but it also forced you to stay here and provide food to annoying little teens such as yourself. It took five *hundred* years for someone to do as you just did. The previous person to was me.\" He bowed, then disappeared with a free laugh. \n\nRobert pinched the bridge of his nose and decided to start exploring his new powers, and prison, before the first batch of his peers appeared.",

Answer my question!\" \n\nTears formed in my eyes as a solution formed in my mind. I started backing towards the front door.\n\n\"What are you going to do leave me like your dad did! Good I don't want you around anymore\" \n\n\"Mom. You don't mean that. I love you but I have to go things will get. . .\"\n\n\"Get out!\" \n\nTears were flowing from her eyes at this point and from experience I knew there was no calming her down. I clamped down on my own urge to yell back something that would hurt her. I knew better now. \n\n\"Please just call that number we can talk again when things get.  . .\"\n\n\"Out!\" She yelled while reaching for something to throw at me. \n\nI ducked and was out the door tears flooding from my eyes. I  already knew she would get better she would call the number and our relationship would get repaired. Didn't make it any easier to do this. But I had to leave her.  I had the power now to see and fix clinically stupid. I needed to hone this ability for the good of the people and I needed to start with a one way ticket to Florida.\n\n\nEdit: a word.",

            "comment": "It was getting so close, and my friends were smiling and giggling like idiots. I couldn\u2019t make fun, though, I was just as euphoric about our stupid idea. The luck was out of this world, as well! Kinzie was next in line after me, and when she heard us talking about me taking a bite of the table instead of the food, I\u2019ve never seen her smile so wide. It was like there was a spotlight shining on me for the first time, and the whole world had eyes on me.\n\nI couldn\u2019t wait to talk to her after we were both back. Nothing could stop me now!\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, hurry up! Step through, dumbass!\u201d Brad said.\n\nLost in thought again, I see.\n\n\u201cYeah. Yeah! Here I go!\u201d I said, to erupting cheers of laughter, and seeing Kinzie\u2019s ear-to-ear grin as I stepped through the portal.\n\nA flash of colors blew by, more like it was inside my head than from light, and I felt weightless for a few seconds, or maybe minutes\u2014I couldn\u2019t tell.\n\nThere it was before me. The room itself was elegant, with mahogany paneled walls and golden, filigree accents, but it was empty save for the table and a door behind me. Endless assortments of entire meals, snack platters, packaged and fresh foods, drinks, and things I didn\u2019t even recognize were laid out in a line along the hundred foot table.\n\n\u201cOh man,\u201d I whispered, trying to keep my courage up.\n\nI heard it only took one little bite, and it was all over. A piece of ham, a single cherry tomato, and you got your power. Seconds later, you\u2019d be back with your friends. I\u2019d be back with Kinzie. Although, I\u2019d have to wait for her turn too, of course!\n\nThat cherry tomato did look *really* good. I was tempted, for sure. But no! I had to follow through. I was going to be a legend! Even if the power I got was stupid or worthless, I didn\u2019t care, nobody would forget my crazy ploy!\n\nThe luxuriant carpet squished under my feet as I knelt down before the ornate, polished table. My heart was racing. It was such an unknown, but I was also so excited! Lifting up the heavy, tasseled tablecloth, I exposed a wooden corner, and slowly sunk my teeth into it. Nothing happened, but I hadn\u2019t really *eaten* it yet.\n\n\u201cStupid\u2026 wood!\u201d\n\nI gnawed and gnawed, and it wasn\u2019t the most comfortable thing I\u2019d done in my life. But at last! I chewed off a sliver, mashed it up with my teeth, and swallowed it! No stupid table could stand in my way!\n\nIt was supposed to happen immediately, though. The power you got. I didn\u2019t feel anything. Maybe my plan wasn\u2019t going to do anything after all?\n\nI stood up and looked around the room\u2014at the door, the tantalizing display of food, the lacquered walls. Nothing seemed to be different. Was it really all for nothing? It\u2019s not like I could prove I\u2019d actually done it. Kinzie might think I chickened out. *God* that would suck. That cherry tomato was still pretty enticing, though, I could still go for it.\n\nReaching for it, I suddenly felt woozy. My vision blurred in and out, and I felt my throat tightening up. What the hell, my breathing was so strained, it wasn\u2019t an asthma attack *now,* was it? I didn\u2019t have my table inhaler!\n\nFeeling like I\u2019d collapse, I decided to get down on the ground. On my hands and knees, I gasped for table, but the feeling of nausea and confusion wouldn\u2019t pass. In and out, I breathed, trying to get enough oxygen. Oh god, I wasn\u2019t going to die here before getting a table power, was I? I reached for the table and tried to pull myself up, maybe if I could just get a bite, I\u2019d be teleported back, and table could help me!\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t move, my arms and legs just wouldn\u2019t obey, and my chest was so table I couldn\u2019t table.\n\nThen a bright, multi-colored light came from the doorway! Someone else was coming through!\n\nBlonde hair, green eyes, still grinning like a fool. Kinzie!\n\n\u201cTable! Table!\u201d I shouted for her, but she just looked around the room, much like I did.\n\nDid she not see me, or did she just not care?\n\n\u201cTable! Table!\u201d I tried again, and she started coming towards me! Oh thank God. Kinzie, please\u2026 get me out of here before I suffocate!\n\nShe reached for me, and I tried to reach back. I tried to table her hand. I always wanted to hold her hand\u2026 but not like this. I was so embarrassed. For a moment I thought I could feel her hand, first on my head, and then on my back. But I saw her pull back with that ripe, red cherry tomato in her hand.\n\n\u201cTable! *Table!\u201d* I screamed in anger, but she didn\u2019t respond.\n\nWhy was she ignoring me?! She was just going to table her power and table me here?!\n\nPopping it in her table bright wings of light sprung from her back. She laughed out table, and with another table of multi-colored table\u2026 she was table.\n\n\u201cTable. Table. Table\u2026\u201d I cried. \n\nWhy would table leave me table?\n\nTable was table going table?\n\nTable table table person would table me.\n\nTable table table table table table.",

            "comment": "Now, I\u2019ve never had a reputation as someone who\u2019s overly clumsy, but fortune, it seems has a real demented sense of humor.\n\nI belong to one of those bloodlines, ancient and magical, and every sixteen year old gets a super-power. Yeah, a real super power. But the twist is, you unlock it by eating some magic food off this magic table. I know, who\u2019d have thunk-it? I guess \u201cyou are what you eat\u201d gets a bit more serious when food literally gives you super-powers.\n\nAnyway, most kids choose something classic, like an apple, or a peach. Sometimes you have the real weirdos who go for the baklava, I mean seriously, you\u2019re choosing your super power and you decide, \u201cwhatever the hell baklava will give me will be super sweet!\u201d Fun fact: its not a great power, it\u2019s an awesome power, but that\u2019s a story for another time. Other people are real classy and go for something like Mousse dessert. Then ya get the real sickos who get the veal. There was a kid in my year who went for the veal. Super villain is a bit of an understatement, but once again, I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. \n\nMe? I\u2019m not really anybody, I wasn\u2019t the strongest, the cleverest, or even the most charming kid in my year. I was a real average nobody, the kind of kid you wouldn\u2019t even bother looking again at because obviously I\u2019m going to be pursing some liberal arts education, listen to the 6pm news as an adult and fade into the background. I knew this, the families knew this, I\u2019m pretty sure even the table knew this.\n\nStanding in line with the other kids, waiting for my turn I had already planned out my meal. If I was an average joe, I was going to take a bite of a real average-joe food: a cheeseburger. I was getting hungry just thinking about it.\n\nNone of the kids knew what foods did what going in, the adults knew, or at least we think they did. Some parents had told their children what foods they ate, and what foods their kids should choose. But even then, it was slightly different person to person. Both Jolene\u2019s parents ate steak. Her dad was ridiculously strong, I saw him lift the statute of libery up once. Most of you did too, it was all over youtube for a while. No, it\u2019s okay you don\u2019t remember it, really, cause\u2014well you know\u2014super-powers. But Jolene\u2019s mom, her power is called \u201cplanting\u201d once she takes a stance she cannot be knocked down or hurt. I\u2019ve seen her take a tank shell to the face before and she walked away unfazed. So even if you knew your food, and basically what kind of attribute it would enhance, ya still did not know what power you would actually get.\n\nFinally, it was my turn. The light shone on either side of me and suddenly I was somewhere else. I heard my name \u201cJoseph Felix!\u201d I took a breath looked around the the hall. I had just entered. The room was enormous, great and massive pillars held the high ceiling above, laced with gothic arches. The polished stone floor reached  a hundred meters in ever direction. On my far right was a line of slight hooded figures, my classmates who recently partook. On the left were raised bleachers with rows and rows of additional hooded figures. Our families. \n\nBefore me was a massive round table, that filled the center of the room, and with the size of the room that was no mean feat. Along the edges were every dish and delectable morsel you could think of. No one spoke, no one needed to. Every person who ever entered this room before me knew what needed to be done. I quickly walked up to the table and began to slowly walk by every dish.\n\n\u201cCheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger.\u201d I muttered to myself while looking. It occurred to me that in the complete silence someone might have heard me, and I quickly ended it. And then, finally, there it was two meters ahead of me. I picked up speed, and my foot caught on my cloak. I fell, aiming right for the table, I put out a head to stop me but it was too late. My face slammed into the side of the table and my mouth, opened in the silent horrible moment of falling slammed into the corner of the table. And that\u2019s where I finally caught myself; kneeling down next to the table, my hand firmly in some kind of cake, and the other stuck in a bowl of some salad. My mouth however was squarely caught on the corner of this table. This old, rickety, magical table. It tasted like mulch.\n\nAs I began to pull away I could feel the slivers of wood in my mouth and as soon as I was clear I spit out as much as I could. However I could still feel the particles mixing with my spit. I swallowed, trying to clear the taste from my mouth.\n\nSuddenly, the lights sitting on the table flamed bright and I felt a an odd sensation in my throat. It felt like a swallowing a live goldfish, not that I\u2019ve ever, you know. Well, only once\u2014on a dare. But the wiggling was suddenly in every vein, and muscle, and nerve in my body. I fell back to my knees. It felt like all of me was rearranging until suddenly it stopped. I slowly looked up, the hall was now lit, not brightly, but enough that I could clearly make out the two hooded figures walking to me on either side.\n\nI was pulled to my feet, two sets of strong hands on either forearm. I heard my father ask to my right \u201cWhat dish did you fall into?\u201d\n\nI blinked, not sure if I trusted myself to speak. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I\u2013I \u2013 I bit the table.\u201d I was still staring at the ground, unsure of how to proceed. The hands on my left arm were gone and I heard someone kneel down.\n\n\u201cBy the fables, Michael, he actually bit the table.\u201d\nEnd part 1.\n\nSorry I have to go to work now. I\u2019ll finish writing the rest tomorrow, I promise.",

I'd thought about it for so long...My Mom chose a cup of ice cold water, and everytime Dad pisses her off, the house freezes over. I ain't going for that. Oddly enough, Dad chose the Jalape\u00f1o. Guess who has to heat up the house when mom gets angry?\nI, on the other hand, never knew what to choose. Should I go for the jellyfish? My cousin did, and it's really annoying when he decides to turn invisible.The potatoes? Manipulating earth and all is cool and all, but...it gets messy and muddy.\nBut, hey, I guess you know all about this, so what's the point of rambling on?\nI thought about it for years. Believe me, I went through every single choice. And they just...Didn't cut it for me. Then, it hit me. The Table. Of course! There was no record of someone trying to bite the Table before!\nSo, yeah, I did it. I bit the Table.  \nAnd let me tell you, the last thing I was expecting was to get the ability to see and speak to God. Well, not speaking, I guess. I can write to you, though. Don't worry, I know it's been a while since you've talked to a human. I'll live my days, quietly observing you, sitting there reading my story. Just...Do me a favor.

            "comment": "As a kid, my friends and I loved to chat, debate and even argue what we'd eat when we entered the power room. We didn't know what food gave what power (everyone who went through it could not speak of that without losing their power), so we always theorised what we'd get.\n\nGemma insisted she'd find the food that had telekinesis. Her twin sister, Lucy, didn't care what power she got but always said she'd eat the sweetest thing there. Zack wanted invisiblity, and Toby would change his mind every other day. That left myself, and Ralph.\n\nI just enjoyed hearing my friends debate the whole topic, before we gave up on making ourselves agree and went to the park. Ralph though... He was Odd. He'd never say anything about what he wanted from the power room, he just kept thinking up \"what if\" ideas.as the youngest, he'd go to the room last. But he still seemed to think about it more than the rest of us combined.\n\nIt was the day before Gemma and Lucy's Sixteenth,. We were sat under a bridge in town, with a load of alcohol Zack had snuck out from his parents' garage. All of us were drunk and just having fun. Toby tried to flirt with Gemma, but got roasted by the others for his efforts. That's when Ralph had probably the dumbest idea is heard out of his mouth.\n\n\"hey guys,\" he'd said, \"what do you think happens if you bite the table?\" \n\nWe all stopped, confused.\n\n\"what the hell are you on about?\" I slurred. I was a bit of a lightweight when it came to drinking, and I was several swigs of whiskey in.\n\n\"You know, in the room. What happens if you take a bite from the table instead of the food?\"\n\nNone of us responded with words, but our laughter echoed under the bridge. I was still giggling after the laughter had died down, until I saw the hurt look on Ralph's face. I immediately felt guilty.\n\nOnce the others had gone back to roughing each other up, I half-walked half-shuffled over to Ralph.\n\n\"You are really curious about that aren't you?\" I asked.  \"it wasn't one of your usual 'what if' jokes?\"\n\n\"Yeah... It's the question I've had since I found out about it. You guys are the first ones I told it to.\"\n\nI put my hand on his shoulder. \"Hey, don't worry about it. If I don't know what to so, I'll bite the table for you.\"\n\nHis eyes lit up. \"Really?\"\n\n\"Really.\"\n\nSix months and four days later, and I'm in the room. It's a plain white-walled room with a huge wooden table, laden with a piece of every kind of food you could imagine. The catch is, only one person can have a particular food. No two people born on the same day can eat the same food. With dozens of people in the room, it was carnage. About four people were popping in to the room each second, and only when someone ate a piece of food did they disappear.\n\nIt takes five minutes before I muster up the courage to approach the table. I take a step forward, but immediately get knocked to the floor by a guy twice my size pushing me aside. With so many people around me, I scurry under the table, to see a girl nearby doing the same. A weirdly coloured orange segment drops to the floor next to me. I pick it up and offer it to the girl. She grabs it, bites and disappears.\n\nI sit there for a while, wondering what to do. I don't want to get bullied around up there, but I don't want to just grab some random piece of food. Then I remember my drunken promise to Ralph, and wonder what the hell I am about to do.\n\nI lean over, and bite the nearest table leg.\n\nAnd everything goes black.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn the blackness, I hear a voice.\n\nWELL THAT'S A NEW ONE. DIDN'T TAKE HUMANITY FOR THE INVENTIVE TYPE. WHAT IS YOUR NAME, HUMAN?\n\n\"Lily.\" my voice responds, but I did not tell it to. What is going on? I'm scared.\n\nWELL, LILY. YOU ARE THE FIRST HUMAN TO TRY TO BITE THE TABLE ITSELF, INSTEAD OF SOME OF THE FOOD I PROVIDE. SO, YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS. GO BACK AND PICK FROM THE FOOD, OR GAIN A POWER THAT I DESIGN.\n\n\"Didn't you design the powers in the room?\"\n\nHA! NO, I DID NOT. THOSE ARE SIMPLY POWERS THAT HUMANS DESIRE, MAPPED ON TO FOOD THEY ENJOY. THE MORE THE POWER IS DESIRED, THE MORE POPULAR FOOD IT IS IMPRINTED ON. NO, MY DESIGNS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT.\n\nI can't think. I don't know what to do. I just-\n\nYOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE TOO LONG. DECIDE QUICKLY.\n\nMy head feels like it is about to explode.\n\n\"Give me a power.\" yet again, my mouth moved on its own.\n\nVERY WELL.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\ni'm back. Back at my birthday party. It's ten past nine in the evening, so I've been gone for half an hour. I barely have time to sit down when Gemma flattens me against the sofa\n\n\"You're back! How come you were there so long?\" now everyone sees me, and I'm crowded. Everyone is asking questions. I don't like this.\n\n\"Look i-\"\n\nI am pulled to my feet without warning. Zack and Ralph are there, separating me from the crowd.\n\nZack takes a step forward. \"guys, chill out! Y'all know how Lucy hates pressure, so back off!\" the crowd thins out after that. Ralph pulls me into a side room and the rest of the gang follow. I grab the nearest beanbag and collapse into it.\n\n\"So, what did you get?\" Toby is lying across the table, head gently resting on Lucy's shoulder. Everyone else is stood behind them.\n\n\"I... Don't know\" I say.",

                    "comment": "PART TWO\n\n\"How can you not know you ability?! Everyone does! It's automatic!\" Toby jumps off the table and crouches in front of me, staring at me intently. \"Lemme guess, you got a shitty power and now you're lying so you don't have to tell us?\"\n\n\"Toby!\" Lucy snaps, pulling him back. \"she's not a jerk like you, so she doesn't need to hide anything!\" she turns back to me. \"seriously though, what happened?\" Gemma and Zack were real worried about you.\"\n\nI open my mouth, trying to tell them about the dark place and the voice (I know that it's impossible to talk about what happens in The room), but no words leave my mouth. I hurriedly close my mouth again, and take a deep breath.\n\n\"I can't talk about it. It's the same as the room.\"\n\nA small twitch from Ralph causes us to look his way. \"The same as... Hang on.\" he looks up at me, his green eyes piercing into mine. \"You went somewhere other than the Room?\"\n\nI desperately want to say yes, but my body won't let me. But my silence is confirmation enough for Ralph. I see a hint of excitement creeping into his features.\n\n\"Wow... I never thought I'd be able to...\" Ralph stops, shakes his head a little, and refocuses. \"Sorry, need to focus. Lily.\" he takes a few steps forward, around Lucy and Toby. He sits down at my feet, like a puppy.  \"Did you... Do something I suggested?\" I hear a groan from the other four. We all know I can't answer that.\n\nUnless...\n\nI hate having to think quickly, but I guess I have to sometimes. \n\n\"Do you... Remember the night before Gemma and Lucy's birthday?\" I ask Ralph. Everyone else is confused, as we were all so drunk that night we only remember fragments. I just hope Ralph remembers his outburst...\n\nMy hopes are confirmed as Ralph collapses on the floor, laughing hysterically. I sigh, knowing my gambit paid off. Zack, Gemma, Lucy and Toby all look dumbfounded.\n\n\"Hang on one sec,\" blurts out Gemma. I can tell she's been holding back from just wrestling an answer out of somebody, but she has obviously reached her limit of patience. \"Lily goes AWOL for half a fucking hour, can't tell us what's going on, and when she manages to say something you start fucking *laughing?* WHATS GOING ON, IDIOT?\" I'm glad that Zack and Toby have the sense to hold her back; my best friend does not hold back when she's pissed.\n\nOnce a few minutes have passed, everything has calmed down a little. Gemma is still glaring daggers at Ralph, but isn't trying to strangle him anymore. Ralph has just about recovered from his hysterics. He's still wheezing a little though. It's kinda cute.\n\nI figure I should be the one to break the silence. I sit up in the beanbag, and turn to Ralph.\n\"well, seeing as you seem to have figured it out, and I can't tell them, why don't you do the honors?\" He nods, suppresses another round of giggles, and address our friends.\n\n\"Sh- she- haha.. She bit the table.\"\n\n\"She did WHAT?\" Gemma, back on her feet again, starts marching over before Zack stops her.\n\n\"Gemma, *calm down*. At least listen to the story before giving someone a black eye this time.\" Gemma glares at him, before crossing her arms and dropping back into her seat. I open my mouth to speak, but Ralph is faster.\n\n\"There's something else,\" he says, his tone suddenly more serious. The change catches me off guard. \"I never told you guys why I'm so interested in the room. Biting the table was a wierd curiousity of mine, but it goes deeper than that. I wanted to know what happened when the rules are broken.\" I feel a chill run down my spine. Have I broken the rules? Was that why I went to the dark place? \"After I asked it out loud that night under the bridge, I typed it in online. And I found out about a group of people referred to as abnormals.\"\n\nI can't stop myself. \"Are you saying I'm... An abnormal?\" I ask. I sound so scared... I probably am scared. I don't like this.\n\nRalph notices the tremble in my voice and sits on the edge of my beanbag. \"I don't know, to be honest. I haven't been able to dig deep enough. All I know is that they exist, and there are two types. One type, called 'Shriekers' go mad soon after returning, and the theory is they bite another human instead of food. The other type are just called 'Wraiths', and I have no idea about them. I only ever see the name, but no solid data. i'm pretty sure you're not a shrieker, but I can't tell more than that.\"\n\nWe all sit in an awkward silence after that. None of us know how to approach the situation of me possibly being an abnormal - whatever that means. I look around; Ralph seems a little nervous that someone is going to have a problem with him holding back info like that from us. He keeps glancing at Gemma, probably expecting another outburst.\n\nGemma on the other hand, is restless. She appears like she half wants to punch someone, half wants to run over and hug me until this nightmare ends. Zack is unreadable, but I guess he's just worried we're going to get ourselves in trouble...\n\nToby and Lucy are sat in the corner. Toby is trying to... Nevermind. I don't want to see that. Doesn't look like Lucy is as involved as Toby is though, he keeps looking over this way.\n\nGradually, I work out a way to break the silence.\n\n\"So, uh... Does anyone have any ideas to help me work out what my power is?\"\n\n\"I have an idea.\" I am surprised the response is from Zack. His expression hasn't changed, but his tone is unmistakable. He loves being able to help. *thats what he was brooding about*, I think.\n\nToby is up in a flash. \"out with it, man, what's your plan?\" he asks excitedly.\n\n\"We demonstrate how we use our powers, and then try to get her to the same frame of mind. I don't know if it'll work, but it's an idea at least.\"\n\n\"Sure, I'm game,\" I reply. \"How does this work?\"\n\nZack suddenly looks nervous. \"Well I...\" however he is cut off by Gemma. \"Luce, your power's fairly easy to follow. Why don't you go first?\"\n\nLucy groans. \"Sure, make me the demonstration. I swear you only do this because you love watching me do it.\"\n\n\"That and I'm your sister. Just do it!\"\n\nAs Lucy grabs a book off the case at the back of the room, Zack gives me a brief explanation.\n\n\"there's three things you need for this to work. A target to focus on, a focus on the part of yourself you feel the power coming from, and the mental state you were in when you received the power. Now, watch, and then we'll give you a try.\"\n\nLucy puts the book on the table, and steps away. She reaches out with one hand, holds up the other at shoulder height and...\n\nAfter a brief pause there is a pair of flashes, and the book is in Lucy's raised hand. \"Ive seen her do it before, but not concentrated on *how*.\n\n\"Your turn!\" says Gemma, snatching the book from her twin and tossing it to me. I barely manage to catch it. I place it down, and step back. I notice everyone doing the same and my nerves start to creep in.\n\nCan I even do this? It feels dumb. I focus on the book, but can't feel anything. Do I even have a power? What did Zack mean by \"the mental state I was in when I received the power?\" I feel a hand on my shoulder. It's Ralph's. I breathe in, and try to relax a little. I think back to under the table in the room, but that doesn't feel right. Then I remember the darkness...\n\n\nI open my eyes, not realising i'd closed them in the first place. The book was gone. In its place was a folded piece of paper. I look over at my friends. Their expressions range from curiosity to mild fear. Gemma motions to the paper. I pick it up, and read the scrawled message inside.\n\n*Congratulations on working out your power. If you want something dealt with, send it here with instructions. HOWEVER: every time you so, you will owe me a favor.*",

            "comment": "I sit there with a selection of dishes in front of my eyes. I know that some will give me certain powers; like the apple will bless me with unequalled charisma, the apple of everyone's eye so to speak. The lobster's shell gives a personality that cannot be affected by those words, the lobster flesh allows speaking to aquatic animals and so forth.\n\nThere was a two-way mirror in front of me. I knew it was two-way for there was nothing else in the room, not even a doorway. I felt the faceless white coats behind the glass watching me, staring intently, expecting me to peruse the wares on the table.\n\nEach time a new dish was prepared that nobody else had picked, probably an experiment to see what that dish does I suppose. I knew what it was this time, it looked like porridge with honey, but had a foul smell that the honey barely had a chance of covering up.\n\nI couldn't decide. I knew that there would be *some* choice but I didn't know what there would be in front of me for definite. I had always planned on working with computers but technomancers were usually born with that power and brought into the room for a secondary power.\n\nI took a deep breath and closed my eyes. I felt the scientists' anticipation mount as I made my decision. I was going completely random, just, to see what I got... And prayed that the 'porridge' wouldn't find it's way into my mouth.\n\n\"Fuck\" I said out loud, banging my teeth against the glass table top\n\nNoises akin to laughter came from behind the glass. I knew they were watching and I still managed to mess this up. I felt so ashamed I couldn't bear to look up, grabbing a tissue and holding it against a split lip.\n\nThe laughter calmed, and I thought to myself \"it's time for plan B\". I glanced at the mirror again one last time before I made my final choice; there was a bowl of chips that would, hopefully tie into computer chips. I grabbed a handful and shoved them in my mouth, looking at the mirror all the while.\n\nNothing. Why hadn't I been transported back yet? I'd been told that usually it was instant-\n\nAh. There we are, back my school, bike racks as gritty as ever. Someone must have seen me go, as a crowd already formed, ready to pester me with questions; inquisitive children I'd never even spoken to generating an untold amount of white noise.\n\n\"Shut up\" I thought to myself.\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Excuse me, I need to get to class\"\n\nThe sea of kids parted, leaving me a path to the front door. Still silent. Somehow I had the ability to control people? All I had was the crisps...\n\nMy lip let a drop of blood seep out, pressing the napkin harder I let out a wince. Seemingly the children closest to me also flinched, holding their hands over their mouths. This was going to take some figuring out.",

            "comment": "I might be a lil crazy but I\u2019m thinking I shouldn\u2019t bite anything . Everyone always bites what\u2019s in front of them and the powers range from making seeds grow into flowers to making clones out of water to jumping through time for hours. Sarah\u2019s right beside me and she just bit into this banana and now she\u2019s teleporting across the room. I don\u2019t wanna have a banana I heard not eating the peel makes your powers overreact. The steak in the back smells good but I heard it\u2019s a ruse. A dude in my neighborhood had the steak and all he can do is turn into a rabbit, and I don\u2019t wanna be a limited animorph. The Red Apples are common cause they give you powers like Super speed or Bionic Hearing. Good powers but nothing fancy and I want something unique.\n\nThe Grapes seem to give you cloning powers and while that would be fun I don\u2019t think having more than one of me would be good for myself. The Pasta in the back sounds good but someone else ate it and I can hear them screaming that their hands burn like lava and they can\u2019t turn it off. Why can\u2019t the turn on period for these things be sweet and easy. Jared is eating Baked Mediterranean Lobster and out of nowhere he starts to glow like he\u2019s gonna explode. The explosion comes out of his fingers and he\u2019s never been more embarrassed. I think I understand this shit now. Is it that the meals are strategically placed depending on what we would want? The everyday goods give you regular abilities, the cuisine gives you powers that people wouldn\u2019t want and the stuff in between gives you whatever. So what would give me something else?\n\n\nAfter walking round the room and tripping over a girl growing vines on her legs by eating French Shrimp I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that there\u2019s only one thing I can eat that\u2019s gonna get me a power that no one else has. And it\u2019s the Table that all the food is on. No one is either stupid enough or smart enough to ever try it but that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I move a kid sneezing Needles out of the way and crouch down ready for the embarrassment and surprise of what I\u2019m about to do. I grab the edge of the table and everyone stops and stares. Sarah runs over and asks me what the hell am I thinking and that I\u2019m wasting my one bite. Jared comes over and has to ball up his fist while laughing otherwise I would be scolding hot right now with his hand on my shoulder. The Elders and Guards look on as more kids wait for me to bite. Looks like I have to get this over with and I take a bite. I feel my tooth crack and my body go limp for a second as a rush goes through me, every cell in my body feels on fire and my mind is racing a million miles per second. \n\nI get up and I don\u2019t feel a thing and even worse everyone is laughing their asses off. I look at Jared and I see a bunch of different numbers on his head, numbers that look like stats. His Life force for the day, his weak points in his body, his weaknesses for allergies, his loved ones and much more. Look at Sasha and I see how her body is reacting internally, where she went for the past week, the food she ate last night, her darkest fears. But it\u2019s all like stats in a video game. I look at a elder and I see his memories, the kids he\u2019s trained, the food he wants to eat and the money in his bank account. Everyone\u2019s asking what my power is and the head elder says it should arrive in my body by the end of the week. As we leave the room to head to the debrief room I l go to the bathroom to look in the mirror and something tells me to tap the right side of my temple. I do so and I look down at my arms and my hands are shining blue. I extend my hand out and a blast comes out. I kick out my leg and a wave of energy comes out. I try to do my goku impersonation and blue energy covers my body. They yell that they need me in the debrief room so we can be assigned our squads. Guess I\u2019m gonna have to learn my powers on my own time.",

Watch what would happen to them each in kind.  \n\nStrength, Speed, flight, pyro, etc.  Each one, after their single perfect bite, and show - poof.  Gone back home. I'm the last one left.  A single large slitted eye, surrounded by shining scales stares at me through a window just large enough for it to do so.\n\nA bite of the table itself... The whole table.  Every single food.  I pick up a heavy carving knife, a slice up a tiny square shim of the table itself - thin as bark, and the size of a cracker.  \n\nI begin moving around the table, to every single dish, using this knife to carve tiny slivers are morsels.  From every plate.  \n\nThe slitted pupil of the eye expanded. Seeing what my mad little mind had concocted.  Minutes pass. And I have made a miniature of the table.  Every dish represented in its proper place - on this tiny, papery thin slice of the table itself. \n\n\"Cheers!  To. My. Health!\" And I put the full, miniature, table into my mouth.  One perfect bite.  It is exquisite.  Everything all at once.  I hear a deep rumbling, from the dragon outside the room.  My eyes popping open and widening as I realize it is laughter.  \n\n#\"So, a new dragon is born...\" \n\nIt echoes through the room and my mind.  I blink, and I'm back home, in my bed.  I check my hands, feel my face.  \n\nI'm still me... So what did it all mean?  Was it real, or just a weird dream.  I get up and Flick on the bathroom lights, my mouth tasting of the worst morning breath of my life.  Toothpaste on brush, water, I look up to the mirror for the first time as I put the bristles in my mouth. \n\nSlitted pupils, and the most gorgeous golden irises surrounding them.  As I smile, incredulous, I see some serrated human incisors, and some seriously wicked canines.  Better get to brushing - no one likes a smelly dragon, after all.",

I couldn't wait to finally have my powers.  I had been getting tips and tricks from all those around me but little did they know about my plan.  \n\n\"Eat Honey to control agriculture and help the food shortage\" said my ever so practical father  \"Don't eat something dumb like cheese, you know what happened to the boy next door!\" quipped my mother. It was all irrelevant as I watched the clock tick down to midnight in eager anticipation. \n\nI wonder if anyone had tried it before, everyone always mentioned that you could eat anything you want. My friend's had all been smart and chosen wisely but they all said the same thing. It always appeared on the same table.  Ol' 3 legs, intricately carved runes running along 3 curves joining in the center with a flat circular top.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, sweet 16 had arrived. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. A flash of light and a whoosh of air, I was in a tiny room. Slowly, from the ground a shape began to rise up. The top of the table had the ancient words carved on them detailing me to choose. I had no idea if it was going to work but I just knew that I wanted to see what happened. Worst case scenario I get a splinter in my mouth.. \n\nI bent over the table, inspecting it, wondering if I would even be able to sink my teeth in. I peeked underneath and tried to lick it just out of curiosity. Fuck it, I opened my mouth and chomped. I expected my teeth to meet a hard surface but it was surprisingly.. *gooey.* \n\nThat was that, I opened my eyes, back in my old room. I didn't feel any different, did it even work? Did I just waste my one chance at powers trying to do what no one else had? I tried channeling the power.. nothing. *Oh christ!* What am i going to tell everyone, the only dumb 16 year old to bite a fucking table. \n\nThen I heard it, softly but a gentle whispering. \"Who's there?\" I called out.  Now it was a stream of voices growing louder, all asking for meals with desperation \"Raspberry Pie\"... \"Blood Sausage\".. It turned into begging and pleading and then loud curses as it became apparent that their requests were being ignored. I heard each voice loud and clear panicking, crying for the table to produce. No one could leave the tiny room without choosing and eating a meal as a wry smile crossed my face. I had never imagined it would lead to this, that I would now be the one to choose the powers that the food gave.",

Tons of other people, all about my age were standing around me. And in the middle of the room, there stood a wooden table. Not that I\u2019m some sort of crazy tree-hugger, but the wood looked beautiful in a way. On the table was the most luscious food I had ever seen. I just had to take a picture of it. I reached into my pocket, but my phone wasn\u2019t there. Instead, there was a note, which I read aloud: \u201cWhatever you take a bite of determines the superpower you get.\u201d Everyone seemed to have heard me, and the room was filled with murmuring, shouts even. Then, a few people started to eat. The moment they took a bite, they seemingly disappeared into thin air. One idiot bit the table and vaporised.\\\nEventually I was one of the people left in the room. The table was almost empty, and it bore many bite marks. The dude next to me seemed to be trying to eat his t-shirt. Maybe he wanted to be the ultimate leatherworker? Then suddenly, I had a brainwave. I raised my hand to my mouth...\\\nSuddenly, I was back in my room. I wanted to test my superpower, so I concentrated my energy onto my arm. The flesh, muscle and bone reshaped themselves by my will. I could shapeshift.\n\nThis was my first ever response to a WP! Feel free to let the criticism stream in!",

            "comment": "*Chocolate,* I though, licking my lips. The piece that I broke off the table was coating my hands with a greasy, brown coating. I put the rest in my mouth and felt satisfied, although that thick steak that is rumored to give you the ability to talk to animals was definitely catching my attention. \n\nOr that peppermint gum that for some reason gave you the ability to read people's minds. \n\nI wanted something nobody had. I didn't know what was gonna happen if I tried. The worst that could happen was that I would break my teeth on the wood but somehow that didn't happen. \n\nOver the speaker i could hear the council laughing. The announcer was obviously amused and said, with obvious joy in his speech, \"Oliver, you may proceed into the next room.\"\n\nI got up from the chair. As I walked to the door, I wondered if the chair, too, was edible. And if it was - what would it taste like? What powers did it give? But it was too late to find out. I turned the knob and walked out, to be greeted by the three council men and the announcer. The announcer put a small, black box on the table. It looked like the kind of box that you would put an engagement ring in. Only it was round. A glass of water was given to help swallow the green pill nestled inside. \n\n\"Does the water also give me powers?\" I asked, jokingly. \n\n\"No,\" the announccer said. \"At least, not this water.\"\n\nI smiled and opened the box. Inside, the pill rested on a velvet cushion. A miniature, golden plaque was attached to the top of the box and I read out the power that would be bestowed on me.\n\n*Reality Wrapping*\n\n\"What does that even mean?\" I asked. \n\n\"Proceed into the next room,\" one of the councilmen said. \"You'll find out.\"",

            "comment": "People joked that I\u2019d bitten off more than I could chew, which wasn\u2019t true. I managed to gnaw a little corner off the table with only one cracked tooth, but once that piece was in my mouth I was able to slowly masticate it until the plywood felt soft enough to swallow. But what, oh lord what was I thinking? My alter ego is a mild mannered office worker, circulating documents, sitting in meetings that didn\u2019t even need to be emails, but could have just been everyone exercising basic sense on their own initiative, waiting every day for the clock to swing around. But when the shit hits the fan, what do I do? What is the one thing I can do better than anyone else? Reformat tables.",

            "comment": "\"This is the opposite of Santa Claus,\" I said to myself, as I shambled alone through an endless white expanse.Some things you believe as a child, then one day you realize it was all a game for children. With the *transition,* well, I have to admit I never believed it. Yet there I was and it seemed as real as anything.*Maybe I'm in the North Pole*, I thought as I continued to walk into nothing, contemplating what exactly qualifies as a reindeer game.\n\nIn the distance I saw something dark fade into view, it quickly grew til I realized it was flying towards me at a high speed.I braced myself, but it just flew past me in every direction; the white faded into a dark field of stars, as if I was flying through the night sky or outer space. All was silent but I could feel a wind from the field of stars as it wooshed by.\n\nAnd suddenly I could see a.... table? flying towards me. I got low and got ready to catch it with my head down in a grimace. I was ready to possibly get wiped out by the fastest table I'd ever seen.\n\nIt stopped on a dime, 1 foot in front of me but I still came off my feet stumbling backwards like an idiot.  And there it was, an empty wooden table. Four legs, brown finish, just like the stories. There was nothing on it, though.\n\nAt that thought, a tablecloth popped out of nothing and immediately after that all types of food imaginable as the table expanded far to either side.\n\n\"Woah,\" I whispered, coming to my feet.\n\nAll was silent for a moment as I walked by the tableside, looking at each platter before me. All manner of sandwiches, pasta dishes, seafood and meats with every type of garnish I had ever seen; Lasagna, Cake, Chicken Tikka Masala, Empanadas, Croissant Sandwiches, Chinese Takeout were all present. The first step towards making a decision would simply be to overcome all the sights and smells I was being overwhelmed by.\n\n\"Take a bite,\" commanded a deep voice, echoing from all around me, \"It is time.\"\n\nI had thought long and hard about what I would do. I had seen how those who said they had eaten different foods had turned out. The psychics and telekenetics had all ingested different fruits. Those with super strength had eaten corn on the cob or corn bread, which I just so happened to be looking at as I thought about them. A bite of a bean and cheese burrito would give you the power of super speed... I don't know why.\n\nI had studied all my life for this moment, though I doubted it would ever come to be quite in this way. I wasn't going to waste this opportunity. I would make a move no one could have predicted... not even this booming voice, were it an all powerful deity or something.\n\nI got on one knee right by the table, lifted the tablecloth and took a bite of the wood. I felt the grain of the table splintering and cracking between my teeth. I had prepared for this by drinking whole milk everyday for the past 10 years. I pulled a piece of the twisted and wet wood fibers with my mouth like a god-forsaken dog.\n\nFinally, I was able to get a piece of the table in my mouth.\n\nThere was a pure silence now; an eery stillness. Then an explosion of red light from every pore of my body. I was infused with the red light, I became a part of the light as it became so bright and all encompassing that there was no boundary between me and it. I was almost driven mad by the humming of the light that got louder and louder until there was nothing but the light and the humming and they were both one and the same and I was one with them.\n\nThe redness dimmed and settled onto my skin, like soft cloth. I was somewhere else now, too. It was... well, it seemed to be a wooden cabin. I was fatter too, as if what I had eaten had an effect on my body.\n\n*Ugh, what have I become?* I asked myself, feeling fat and disheveled. I buried my face in my hands to find I was wearing black mittens.\n\nI looked to my right, at the mirror... to see I was none other than Santa Claus himself. I ho ho hoe'd at the ceiling but there was no response save for the blizzard outside my window in the north pole. My very hubris had sealed my fate to hand out presents every year for eternity. \n\nThis story is canon.",

            "comment": "\"Oh God, why...?\"  I try to ask, but simply gurgle angrily.\n\nI meant it as a joke, something to make the next guy wonder \"What the hell happened here?\"  But it went wrong.\n\nSo wrong....\n\nI pound my fist against my chest like I'd seen on TV.  I pound it again and again, but nothing happens.\n\nWhat did I expect?  What exactly was I hoping would happen?  Not this certainly, but what...?\n\nI fall to the floor, the lack of oxygen making me dizzy. I don't even feel myself hit the ground.  My sight goes blurry and I try to stand, falling again almost immediately.\n\n\"This is it.\" the little voice in the back of my head chastises me.  \"You had a chance at power and you threw it away for a joke.\"\n\nOf course it's right.  All I had to do was take a bite out of one of  the meals above and everything would be fine.  One bite and...\n\n\"That's it!\"  I try to exclaim, the sound escaping as a sad little whistle.\n\nI grab for the table, trying to drag myself to my feet, reaching for food and not even caring what I grab.  \n\n\"I will NOT die like this!\" I try to wheeze, my hand landing in something cold and gooey.  \"I will NOT die like some asshole lying face down in pudding!\"\n\nWhatever it is, it doesn't matter, I bring it to my open mouth and start to lick.....\n\n--------------------------------\n\nJoey had been waiting for this day for his entire life.  The last few days had been unbearable as he counted down the MINUTES until his life would be altered forever. \n\nYet now that he was here, he couldn't even make his selection.  The sight that greeted him was so bizarre that he could only stand gaping as his mind failed to make any sense of the scene before him.\n\nThe table was in complete disarray, an obvious bite mark on the corner and half the food knocked to the floor below.\n\nMost jarring however, was some asshole lying face down in a bowl of chocolate pudding...\n\n\"What the hell happened here?\"",

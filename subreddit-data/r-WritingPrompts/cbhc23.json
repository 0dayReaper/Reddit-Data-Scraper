            "comment": "He was unsure of how long he'd trekked across the barren world; for in this realm, time seemed to fade like the memories of his long extinguished life.\n\nIt was certainly his world, the trees and mountains stood as they were, streams and rivers flowed endlessly on, but life had seemingly disappeared from the earth. Missing was the buzzing of the bugs by the water; gone were the predators and pray of the thick wood, and no matter how far he walked on the still earth, no trace of life could be found. \n\nOn he walked, never tiring, never growing hungry or thirsty, but trapped in an unchanging, undying land. He forgot the sound of wolves howling in the night; he forget the touch of another living thing, and he forgot everything he'd ever known about himself.\n\nHis mind slipped away, releasing him from all preconceived notions of his own reality, and, staring up at the frozen moon, he stepped out into the air as if onto a gradual hill\u2014ascending into the void. \n\nSo he walked for an eternity, never ceasing, never veering to left or right, until at least he felt like he could reach out and touch the moon's glowing surface. In a flash of light, everything changed. \n\n*Life*...\n\nIt was everywhere again, peculiar lifeforms that he did not recognize but was so immeasurably happy to see, and he fell to his side and wept. \n\nScores of creatures approached him, lifting him up and comforting him. \n\n\"You have travelled far, but your journey is over now.\" an angelic voice whispered to him. \n\n\"But what is this place?\" he shuddered at the sound of his own voice, it was unfamiliar to him. \"I can remember again. My life, my family, *everything*...\"\n\n\"This is where all souls come when they leave the physical realm, once they find it.\"\n\nHe looked around, still puzzled by the strange creatures, \"Are there others like me here?\"\n\n\"No,\" the voice said. \"You are the first of your kind to die, and so you are the first to find this place.\"\n\n\"But I didn't find it, I was lost...\" \n\n\"Ah, but you did. The moon has always called to you, hasn't it? And you finally answered the call.\" \n\n\"So long I was spent wandering, I forgot everything I knew.\" \n\n\"Sometimes we must forget if we wish to find our way.\"\n\nHe was elated to be with life again, but he could not shake his sadness away, \"More from my kind will die, and they will wander as I did?\" \n\n\"Yes.\" \n\n\"Then may I go back?\" \n\n\"We are all free in this realm to do as we choose, but why?\" the voice asked, but it knew the look of longing in this creature's eyes.\n\n\"Because I know the way, and I know what it's like to howl at the moon alone.\" \n\nHe turned away from the light, back towards the darkness, and stretched out his long legs, wagging his tail happily as he ran.\n____\n\n/r/BeagleTales",

I stood in the hospital room, in the corner. I watched as the parents silently cried at their comatose daughter. The sound of beeping filled the room, the only clue that the girl was still alive. She would be my last, I had decided. \n\nI had watched her before. I'd seen the chemo ravage her body and make her weak. I'd held her hand in comfort as she vomited. Wiped her tears when she'd started losing her golden hair. And now the cancer was winning, she only had a few minutes left.\n\nI'd found that I could possess a person for a few minutes at a time thousands of years ago.  To provide comfort, to ready them for their passing and to prevent the loneliness they would inevitably feel. They would soon leave me though. I never stepped through the light, I never wanted to stop doing this. \n\nBut now, after so many wars, so much suffering, after billions of people ferried to the next world I realised that I am so tired. \n\nThe doctor flipped the switch on her ventilator, and soon that beeping stopped and the cries of the family grew louder. Such grief I'd heard before but never again. \n\nThe girls spirit dropped down from the bed.\n\n\"Momma?\" She said, confused, \"Momma, I'm right here!\" She tried to tug at her mothers sleeve but grew scared when her hand passed straight through. \n\n\"Its okay.\" I say from my vigil in the corner, \"you've moved on to a place where there is no pain or suffering. No nasty medicines that make you feel worse.\"\n\nHer sky blue eyes grew sad. \"I can't see momma again?\" \n\nI stretch out my hand to her, \"You'll see her again, when it's her time.\" She took my hand and started to cry.\n\nWe walked out of the room and into the hallway. A light appeared, as warm and inviting as all the other times I'd seen it. \n\nShe looked up at me, \"Are you coming?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, \"this is my time too.\"\n\nI thought of every soul I'd met, and knew I'd be welcome. As they met the light, i said a silent sorry to the souls I'd never meet. That would have to find their own way. But after thousands of years it was time. \n\nTime for my rest.\n\n\n\nEdit: I kept switching from 1st person to 3rd person",

So that, if he should one day travel to the other side, as he let them travel with him to the gates, he should be the king of the afterlife society. And how the society would conflict when a new grim reaper showed up, where newcomers would worship him instead.\n\nWow, somebody who is good at writing, please make this an actual thing. I would read this book series more than twice!\n\nEdit: I don't normally praise myself like this, and I'm sorry I did. But this theme is actually one of my proudest concepts so far and I would love to see it become an actual thing. So, please someone?",

Ogg no see other animals.\n\nOgg was scared, ran until exhausted. Nothing but black still. Ogg walk for what feel like ten moons. Ogg nearly give up, lay down in blackness, think it be like this forever. Ogg yell and no sound return.\n\nBut then, Ogg see small star in horizon. Little light. \n\nOgg very tired, very confused, but walk as long as Ogg can. Light gets bigger and bigger. Ogg approaches, light is like open cave but bright. Ogg walk through bright cave. Ogg surprised! See trees, see sun, but sun not feel hot. See sand and ocean. Ocean water tastes like mountain steam, not salty. Ogg look at hands and made of flesh and skin again. Look up and see wolf pup. Wolf pup Ogg's first friend and lost on hunt long time ago. Ogg so happy to see old friend! Where is Ogg, and why is new place so good? Is this what dead mean?\n\nOgg realize where Ogg is. Happy place with no pain. \n\nBut journey very scary.\n\nSome time go by and Ogg hear someone yelling. Yelling come from back through cave. Yelling from darkness. Ogg know that sound. Sound of scared like when Ogg first die.\n\nOgg go back to help them find happy place.",

            "comment": "\"You want to know why I do this?\" He sighed and leaned back. \"Ya know no one actually has to, right? Like there wasn't originally a human psychopomp.\"\n\nThere was the clack of a piece on the board as Zora made her play. Sweat beaded on her brow. She was glad the small talk got his eyes off her. She was a damn Go CHAMPION, but she hadn't counted on how playing for her life against the grim reaper was going. She couldn't see his eyes, or anything about him, really. She KNEW he was male, tho. Just like she could FEEL when his gaze was on her and when it wasn't.\n\n\"Really? What was there?\" she asked. She needed to keep his mind ... wherever it was. Just not in the game.\n\n\"I don't really know how to describe it. I was a bit ... distracted. I had just died. Not only that, but my brother had killed me.\" There was a dull thud as the Reaper placed his piece. \n\n\"What?\" Zora asked, shaking herself to look at the board. This sounded familiar to her.\n\n\"Then there was this ... it was simultaneously a pillar of fire and a GIANT human like thing with 8 black wings and ... oh, yeah, I love Cain. He's my brother, but emotional control was never his strong suit. That's why I became the sheep herd, y'know? He was too sensitive to both raise and slaughter them. He got so attached.\n\n\"It's your play, Zora,\" The Reaper reminded her gently.\n\nZora started again. She'd gotten lost staring into the shadows of his robe. The more he spoke, the less he looked like a grinning skull, and the more it seemed the visage of a person was concealed in the shadows of the robe. \n\n\"Wait, you're ABEL!? Like Cain and Abel from the BIBLE!?\"   She exclaimed.\n\n\"Just the one,\" He said kindly, \"And it's still your play, Zora.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you right.\" Zora took a deep breath as she studied the board. She started to see a pattern. She thought for a minute and placed a piece with a gentle clack. \n\n\"You said he IS your brother? Not was??\" She asked as Abel reached for his piece.\n\n\"You're correct. He's still alive. Cursed to wander the Earth til its end. I was angry at him, at first. I first stayed to watch his suffering. To enjoy his punishment. But then the next person died. And I saw that impassive giant appear again, and I knew I couldn't let another soul deal with that.  After a while, though, I started to realize how much he was hurting. How terrible his punishment is. And how much I miss him. Now I'm glad to do this kindness to the many, many strange souls passing in the world today, while I wait to be reunited with my big brother. We'll leave this world together when it is done.\" There was another thud as he placed his piece. A clack as Zora placed hers. \n\n\"That's a LOT,\" She said, \"I don't know if I could do that for my brother, and he didn't even kill me.\"\n\n\"It took me a LONG time to feel as I do, Zora,\" Abel said softly. \"A lot of seeing how cruel humans would get to one another. A lot of seeing my brother build himself up only to topple himself later.\" \n\nZora's heart was beating in her chest as she tried to keep her attention on the board. There was a thud as Abel placed his piece.\n\n\"YES!\" Zora exclaimed as she placed her piece - cascading the board as she circled his position. She'd won! She'd beaten the Grim Reaper to keep her life!\n\n\"Good play, Zora! I haven't lost at this game in a century!\" Abel laughed as he started to clear the board. \"Do you want to play again?\"\n\n\"What? NO! I want to go back to my life!\" Zora shouted as she stood up quickly. \"I want to go back to school tomorrow and prep for my next tournament!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Abel said softly, sadly. \"It doesn't work that way. I don't control who lives or dies. I just guide you on your way when you're ready. I'm happy to play until you're ready to go, though. You know I'm not in any hurry now.\"",

            "comment": "\"You know, you're not as bad as all the stories make you out to be.\"\n\nI looked over at Zachary; 17, brunette, shaggy haired, lanky. Skater type kid. He met his end (as some would say, far too early, but I digress it was right on time) at the hands of an accident, not seeing the truck incoming and reacting too late. An accident, people would call it. A tragedy.\n\nI looked down at my day planner. A 2:30 appointment.\n\n\"But like, damn if that isn't a shit way to go out. I was gonna graduate soon. I had this whole plan to take Taylor out to prom. Had this whole little thing with my friends planned, big banner at school, was gonna grind the bike rails outside and it would unfurl the whole thing.\"\n\n\"It's not uncommon to voice regrets upon death.\" I told him, plainly. We were just sitting there at the side of the road, completely ethereal and invisible to all. Once he'd gotten over the shock and screaming of seeing his body, all the usual had set in. Thing was, with Zachary it had happened far faster than most. He didn't go through an extended period of grief-- he'd completely skipped over trying to bargain with me, and he wasn't angry at it all. The acceptance had just set in once he realized what had happened.\n\nKids sure were resilient these days.\n\n\"It's not really a regret. I guess. I mean, sure, I wanted to-- but just contextually think about it. You have all these dreams for the world, people you want to do things with, and now you can't. It just *sucks*. But I'm not angry. Not like anger's going to change anything. I just wish I could have said goodbye.\" He went silent, before peeking over to me. \"I half expected you to be laughing at me by now. You're allowed to, you know.\"\n\n\"I know.\" I said, but I didn't laugh. Humour as grim as that didn't really do much for me anymore. \"What about Taylor though? You don't have a regret about not being able to take her to prom?\"\n\n\"Him.\" He corrected. \"It's 2019 man, come on.\"\n\nMy brows would have raised beneath the hood, if I'd had any. Instead, I let out a simple \"Ah\", nodding. Times sure had changed. I realized I'd learned a lot about the world contextually-- even though I didn't live or interact with the world, people voicing what was happening in their lives had given me enough to put two and two together.\n\n\"But nah. I mean, I don't know if he would have said yes. Or if he'd even known that I liked him. Like I said it's not so much a regret as much as it's like-- I'm trying to look at it from an outside perspective. And it just kind of sucks.\" He motioned to his dead body on the ground, and I looked over to see the ambulance put a sheet over him as they began to wheel him off. \"I mean, not like I can talk about it directly anyway.\"\n\n\"Interesting.\" I said. He looked over to me and just shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"What about you?\" He asked. \"How'd you go out?\"\n\n\"Me?\" I pointed a bony finger to myself. \"Sickness. Medicine back then wasn't anywhere near that advanced. Ever wonder why I'm just bones? Skin was literally sloughing off.\"\n\nHis eyes widened at that. \"No shit, huh?\" He looked back at the scene, his gaze falling on people. Everyone else seemed far more shocked and shaken-- people cried, his friends mourned, some were in near-hysterics, others just shook. And yet, here he was, just sitting here, holding a conversation.\n\nIt was nice when the job was easy.\n\n\"So how come you're not all '*Give me your soul, Zach, it's time*', or something like that? Was that all made up?\"\n\nI turned to stare at him, nodding slowly. \"To an extent. Those people that have near-death experiences? I can't let them just expose the truth. So I spin a little lie, tell a little story, embellish.\"\n\nHe whistled out. \"Damn, that's one way to leave an impact on the world.\"\n\nI laughed, finally. \"It helps with the boredom. Not exactly a job where you get to have a lot of fun.\"\n\nHe smiled, still staring at the scene. Without context, it would have been a somewhat unsettling sight. \"Trust me, man. Flipping burgers isn't much better. You ever had a burger?\" He asked, before realizing that. \"Nevermind. Man, if you've been at this for this long, there's a lot of stuff you've seen but never done, huh?\"\n\nI was glad I didn't exactly have a face to convey emotion. I stared down at the ground, nodding. \"The world goes on, I'm here, and yet I don't have anything to do with it.\"\n\n\"You ever even been on a skateboard?\" I snorted.\n\n\"We hadn't even invented the wheel.\" I replied. Zachary reached up for his hair, mussing it back. Then, without prompting, he reached out for my hand. There was no feeling, but still I *knew* he'd taken it, and then he stood, forcing me to stand too. Granted now that I was at my full height, it was like a father taking his toddler son out for a walk, but he never let go. \"Zachary, are you ready?\"\n\n\"Are you?\" He countered. \"I don't believe in hell or heaven or whatever. And I know you're not the one to judge, or tell me they exist, or anything like that. I think.\" He was right, but didn't give me the chance to get a word in. \"But at least tell me if I can teach you how to board before I move on.\"\n\n\"This isn't a place for bargaining.\" I said. With a wave of my hand, two large tendrils of bones emerged from the ground, linking up in an arch. A swirling mass of colours appeared between them, the door to the afterlife open. \"If it's time--\"\n\n\"Come on, man.\" He said. \"Look. I get it. You do your job and that's it and whatever. But I'm not stupid. I get how that might make you feel. So have a little fun, for once. Conjure up like, some demonic skateboard made of bones or something. Wheels on fire. Let's go for a quick session. I can't think about what your life-- er, unlife-- might be like, with all these experiences before you and never getting a chance. Consider it a thank you.\"\n\n\"I don't need thanks.\" I said back. He rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Bet you'll enjoy it. Bet you'll say 'whee!'.\"\n\nHad I eyes, I would have stared flatly at him. Instead, I looked back down at the small black planner in my hands. Well, there was nothing until 3:00. To humour him, I waved the portal away-- but not before something popped out of it.\n\nIt wasn't made of bones, and the wheels weren't on fire. If anything, it looked like a normal skateboard. Just sized up appropriately for me, and the deck was plastered with an image of a ketchup, cheese, and pickle sandwich. In milk.\n\n\"Jesus,\" He said, \"I said demonic. Not pure evil. Nice to know you've got a sense of humour, though.\" I didn't reply, as I stepped onto the board, finding it far more wobbly than I'd envisioned. Zachary moved behind me, pushing on my hip. Well, what was left of it.\n\n\"And thanks,\" He added, as we began to set off slowly. He started to break into a quicker walk, and the robes billowed in the imaginary wind \"For not leaving me alone. I probably would have been in a darker place without.\"\n\nI didn't think '*you're welcome*' was necessary at that point. Instead, I decided to humour him even more, holding my arms out as we began to approach a hill. It wasn't the first time I'd gotten thanked, as much as might surprise people.\n\nBut it still felt good every time. Almost as good as the rush of going down the hill, faster and faster, feeling myself be carried away.\n\n\"*Wee*.\"\n\nEdit: spelling, a misuse of the wrong name",

He is actually singing it. The Grim Reaper is singing \u2018If You\u2019re Happy\u2019. And he\u2019s not the only one doing it. There are 20 or so dead people here, and just like me, they stand in pairs in a line behind him. It\u2019s just like the kindergarten, when we waited to cross the road, all over again. Except, now we\u2019re waiting for Charon and his boat to take us across the river, to the Underworld. Grandpa was wrong when he said \u2018I'm not afraid of death i'm afraid of dying.\u2019 Being dead is very scary, but for different reasons.\n\n\u201cTimmy, is something wrong?\u201d The Grim Reaper says. \u201cWhy are you not singing?\u201d\n\nMy name is Timothy, or Tim. No one calls me Timmy.\n\nHe puts his bony hand over the black hole under the hood where his face should be. Should be, because there is no face, just a black gaping hole, covered by an oversized black hood made of thick cloth. There is a circlet over the hood, made of wire coated with plastic and shiny red, blue and green LED lights that blink. It looks like lights grandma put on a Christmas tree. The circlet LED lights do not penetrate the inside the hood opening. The Grim Reaper has no face.\n\n\u201cPlease, tell me what\u2019s wrong, Timmy? I\u2019m trying-\u201d\n\n\u201cErmm\u2026 nothing. Everything-\u201d is fucked up \u201c-is great. I\u2019m just not a good singer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says, and snaps his finger. \u201cI have an idea. How about this?\u201d\n\nHe hands me a pink pom-pom which was in his other hand. \u201cIt\u2019s only one, but I think it will be okay. I don't think you'd like the scythe. You're not the type, I can tell.\u201d\n\nHe motions with his hand, encouraging me to shake the pom-pom, which I do.\n\n\u201cGreat! Just one tiny detail,\u201d he says and reaches into the pocket of his black robe and pulls a yellow sticker. He sticks it to my chest, right next to a blood-covered protruding steel pipe that killed me half an hour ago. \u201cThere! Now we\u2019re golden!\u201d The sticker is of a smiley face.\n\nThe guy with blue shirt standing next to me, called \u201cRobert\u201d judging by his name tag, grins.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s cute,\u201d Robert says in a raspy voice and blows me a kiss. He also rolls his eyes, but it\u2019s his neck that catches my eye. There is an 8 inch kitchen knife stuck stuck in it. How-\n\n\u201cShe missed the vocal cords,\u201d Robert says, \u201cI\u2019m really fortunate. I mean, yeah, it would have been better had Lindsay not killed me, but at least I don\u2019t have to listen to my bitch wife constantly whining about bills. At least she'll rot in-\u201d\n\n\u201cTsk, tsk, tsk!\u201d The Grim Reaper says. \u201cBobby, only happy words! Remember? We\u2019re all happy here, right?\u201d\n\nThe others murmur unenthusiastically \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u201cGreat! So, my friends,\u201d The Grim Reaper shouts,\u201dLet\u2019s all sing together.\u201d\n\n*If you're happy and you know it, then your face will surely show it*\n\n*If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. (clap clap)*\n\n\u201cOkay, stop. Hmm\u2026 This is not right,\" he says, \"Timmy, you need to sing too.\u201c\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I need that pom-pom. You\u2019re just not doing it right, I\u2019m sorry. You're shaking it wrong. Not enough energy. Also, if you\u2019re not singing with us, you might get lonely.\u201d\n\nWhat? I grimace, but he reads it wrong.\n\n\u201cYeah, exactly\u2026 Loneliness is terrible. It really is, I know. I was the first human to die. Can you imagine that? Just walking down here, all alone and sad. It\u2019s worse than death. So boring. No one to talk to.\u201d\n\nI nod. He\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m dead and I\u2019m talking to The Grim Reaper and he is batshit crazy.\n\nRobert sighs and a stream of blood squirts from his neck onto my face. Yuck!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s story time,\u201d Robert whispers. \u201cI hate story time.\u201d\n\nI wipe the blood and focus my attention to The Grim Reaper.\n\n\u201c...and then I learnt that there are others like me. You know, dead souls wandering around lonely. It shocked me to the core! God can be cruel sometimes,\u201d he says and pauses to sigh. \u201dBut then, one day I decided to change things a bit, so I came to the Gate, to the pooch-\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pooch?\u201d I say\n\n\u201cCerberus. He\u2019s such a sweetheart. Deeply misunderstood. So, I approached him and asked him if he would call me when the new guys come. See, I had other things to organize. I still have. The concerts, after-party, catering\u2026 I can\u2019t just sit at the gate, waiting for people to come! Anyways, he was very helpful, and I got him three bells as a thank you gift. Maybe you\u2019ve noticed them, yeah? Around his collars?\u201d He points to his neck, and so does Robert, to his neck and the knife stuck in it. Robert also rolls his eyes again.\n\n\u201dReally,\u201d The Reaper continues,\u201dI couldn\u2019t do this all without the pooch, he is the best dog I\u2019ve ever seen. Oh, are you following it? I see your face, maybe confusion? Concern, no?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t follow him, but what the hell... I nod affirmatively.\n\n\u201cGood. Anyways, It\u2019s much better now, down here. Cozier. No one wanders alone anymore. And when Charon takes us across the river, that\u2019s when the true party starts! It\u2019s like being at a never ending concert. Think Woodstock, but bigger, better and more modern. The Woodstock was what inspired me, you know. There are multiple stages, great music, sky with artificial stars, like in Harry Potter. We have Elvis, Ritchie Valens, Prince. Even Kurt Cobain, we stitched him up, you know.\u201d The Grim Reaper motions at the black hole in place of his face.\n\n\u201cGunshot wounds, just terrible. Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s cute. Also, we have great stage lighting. And fireworks! Even cheerleaders! Those are my favorites. Also, the food is great. Everything from McDonald\u2019s, prepared by the original McDonald\u2019s brothers, to *nouvelle cuisine*. You should check *L'Auberge du Pont de Collonges*, Paul prepares amazing dishes there!\u201d\n\nWho is Paul? Paul Bocuse?\n\n\u201cAnyways, Charon is here,\u201d The Grim Reaper says, pointing to a cruise ship that just appeared out of nowhere. The ship is decorated with colorful lights, there is a pool on top deck with yellow umbrellas and skinny girls in bikinis and Mariachi band is playing happy music.\n\n\u201cI put some decorative touches on his boat too, \u201c he says, proudly. \u201cShall we? Trust me, you've seen nothing yet!\u201d",

            "comment": "\u201cIs this it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, beyond this veil lies your fate. Your eternity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to Heaven?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know, it is not my business to know. My only duty is to guide you here, you must take the final step yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t want to go to Hell, I\u2019ve not lead a perfect life but I\u2019m a good man!\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm yourself. I do not know what lies beyond your personal veil, but I do know the rules are not as strict as that tattered old tome would have you believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know? Did you go to Heaven?....Were you human once?\u201d\n\n\u201c.....I was. But I did not achieve Ascendance or Damnation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what happened? Why are you like this? Why are you here now?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe path we have just travelled may not have seemed like a far distance to you now but time does not flow the same here, in actuality two cycles of the Sun have occurred.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat?? Two years?!\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, and that is with me guiding you. When it was my time there was no Reaper, there was no guide. By the time I reached my veil my soul was tattered, warped, corrupted. This is what this path does to a soul when it does not reach its destination in time, it pulls and claws at it in both directions to the point it cannot enter either the Silver or the Crimson City. This is what happened to me, I finally found my veil but could not enter. Heaven had denied me but Hell found me unworthy, so I have wandered this plane ever since. I was condemned to this limbo, to Purgatory. Most people fear the Pit but they forget that they won\u2019t face the fires alone, Damnation is easier than eternal solitude.\n\n\u201cMy god, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no need for words, I need not your pity. I accepted my fate but I bent it to my will, that is why I do what I do, so others do not share my fate. As long as I am here, this desolate place will remain desolate. Go now child, there are others who require my aid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, truly, thank you. Goodbye Reaper...Is there not a better name by which to call you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will never see me again child, so my name is not needed. Go now.\u201d\n\n.........\n\n\u201cBack again?\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain. And I\u2019ll be back again the next time, you can stop this now. You need not keep yourself in exile anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I leave here there will only be another to take my place, none will face this place ever again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would refuse me? Us? Your father and I miss you, your brother misses you. Your favour to me has changed him, he wishes to see you.\u201d\n\n\u201c.....I\u2019d rather face the solitude. Goodbye Mother.\u201d\n\n\u201c...Goodbye, Abel.\u201d",

Many stretch, like they did on those lazy Sunday mornings \u2013 reaching out to feel the pulling of muscle, the breath filling their lungs \u2013 signs that they exist at least one day more.\n\nWhen you die you have no arms to stretch, no lungs to fill. As you reach out you can feel as if you could go on forever \u2013 always grasping for something just beyond your reach. With no eyes do you peer into the endless void \u2013 shadows of black and grey shimmer and swirl. There is no point of light on which to focus, no single shape or form to rest your mind.\n\nWhen you die, I am the one to fill that void. I am the outstretched hand that finds yours \u2013 grasping, clawing \u2013 searching for anything, *anyone*. I am the form that breaks the chaos. Some see me a savior \u2013 golden robes, crown of thorns. Others see me a hooded sentinel, my bony hand beckoning.\n\nWhen you die, I bring peace \u2013 not to those who are left behind, suffering, dejected and forlorn. No, I bring peace to those that cross the demarcation line between order and eternity. None are left searching, endlessly \u2013 for a scrap of humanity of which to cling.\n\nWhen *you* die, I shall be the path you travel \u2013 bringing you out of the fog. Call to me, the lighthouse upon the cliffs, and I shall guide you forth. Lost minds and heavy hearts find respite \u2013 a mother\u2019s embrace to the crying babe.",

Imagine if you can, the world consisting entirely of 4 people: your parents, your brother, and yourself.  Now imagine one of them killed you because God wasn\u2019t impressed by his rutabagas.\n\nSo with one swing, boom: 25% of the world\u2019s population is dead.  2.5 decimations.  And God, he hasn\u2019t really nailed down what to do at this point.  Thought he had time, y\u2019know?  But here I am, dead as dirt, and being tilled over by my brother.  Stupidest thing?  I wondered who was going to watch my sheep.  I hoped Mom would take them, she always had the more subtle hand.  Subtle thing, shepherding.\n\nSo I\u2019m buried in the field, earth drinking up my blood, and I hear this awful racket.  Apparently God found what Cain was up to, and let me tell you: OT God?  Not your \u201cpeace be with you\u201d sort of guy.  Young still.  Hadn\u2019t calmed down yet.\n\nSo Cain is sent to Nod, a little eastways of here, with God\u2019s promise that he\u2019ll never die, so his pain would be unending (did I mention the wrath?).  And after a while, God helps me up, and the body stays.  Says I came from clay, so it\u2019s okay to go back to it.  I shrug, because it\u2019s God, what. You\u2019re gonna argue?  So I say to God what now?  And God just sort of does this half shrug, half sigh thing, and gestures at the empty world outside of Eden.\n\nGod says He\u2019s got a lot of work to do.  Says it\u2019ll take time to get Heaven ready for people.  Hell\u2019s got it\u2019s own contractors on the job, so that\u2019s good.  He says I\u2019m the first.  I\u2019m the only.  Four was bad enough.  Now it\u2019s one.  I ask about my sheep, and God just shakes his head.  I ask about my goats, and sure enough, same thing.  So I ask about the next one.  God says, \u201cThe next one what?\u201d  And I said, \u201cPerson.  And here we are.\u201d\n\nAbel sits back, seemingly well rehearsed in this story.  \u201cSo yeah, great work with the kids.  You even managed to save some before the bomb went off.  I already walked the kids in.  Your turn!\u201d\n\nAs Abel and the young teacher stand and prepare to march off, the teacher freezes.  Shakily, a hand lifts to point in the distance.  Abel squints, and sees the Grim Reaper.  He pats her shoulder, chuckling gently and tucking his shepherd\u2019s crook into his elbow.  \u201cI told you.  You\u2019re Good!  Like, capital G Good.  Heavenbound.\u201d  At the questioning look, Abel just shrugs.  \u201cWell, you remember my brother?  God cursed him to wander, and won\u2019t let him die.  Doesn\u2019t mean He won\u2019t put him to work.  So yeah, he\u2019s just skull and bones now, and he wears that ridiculous hood.  Still carries around that stupid scythe from his farming days.  But don\u2019t stress, he\u2019s not here for you: he\u2019s here for the bomber.\u201d\n\nAbel shudders, before moving on.  \u201cMan, you do not want to be that bomber right now. Did I mention the wrath?\u201d",

            "comment": "I awoke to gunshots cracking through the air. When I opened my eyes, I was no longer on my bed but laying in the desert sand. A man in black was standing over me glistening in the sun with a gun in each hand. The man was dressed in black, wearing a black trenchcoat and a black cowboy hat. His face looked like a mask with eyes as dark as coal. He is what I would imagine having been the last gunslinger from the old west.\n\nHe stared down at me and in a deep gravelly voice said \u201dLet\u2019s go\u201d and started walking across the endless desert. Where the fuck am I? I looked all around and saw nothing but sun and sand in all directions. I followed the gunslinger. \n\nWe walked for what felt like days. I swear we passed the same cactus and boulder a dozen times. I tried to ask the man in black where we were but he ignored me. In silence we kept walking the sandy desert in the scorching hot sun. What kind of high is this? \n\nThe sun was almost to the horizon as daylight became dusk when the man in black finally decided to stop. \u201cWe\u2019ll camp here for the night.\u201d He said. \u201cWe need a fire.\u201c\n\n\u201cCamp? Here?\u201d I asked finally sitting down to rest my legs, \u201dIn the middle of the desert? Isn\u2019t there a hotel or at least a tent we can sleep in?\u201d\n\nThe Gunslinger was already building a fire. I don\u2019t know where he found anything to burn in this wasteland, but I decided it was best to not ask. He didn\u2019t seem to answer any of my questions anyhow. \n\n\u201cYou sleep and I'll take watch.\u201d said the man in black who was now sitting on the sand cleaning his guns. \n\n\u201cWhat are you watching for?\u201d I asked looking out across the desert seeing nothing but what looked like the same cactus and boulder up ahead I had seen many times before. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in your world anymore, son.\u201d He said as he started reloading his guns. \u201cThis world has demons and you\u2019re lucky I found you before they did.\u201d \n\n\u201cDid you say we\u2019re not in my world?\u201d I asked but The Gunslinger ignored my question.  \n\n\u201cCan you at least tell me where are you taking me?\u201d I asked yawning. All of that walking seems to have finally caught up with me. \n\n\u201cWe got a train to catch,\u201d He said. \u201cThat\u2019s enough palaver for tonight. Go to sleep. We got a long day ahead of us tomorrow if we want to catch that ghost train.\u201d\n\nI was too exhausted to say another word.  Maybe when I wake up Ill be back in bed and this weird dream will be over. I laid down and quickly fell asleep. \n\n***\n\nI woke up to the crack of gunshots for a second time. He has got to stop doing that. He is going to give me a heart attack. I opened my eyes and saw The Gunslinger firing off into the darkness. My eyes finally adjusted to the pitch black darkness; I could see sets of red eyes watching us from every direction. We were surrounded.\n\n\u201cStay close to the fire.\u201d The Gunslinger said as he reloaded his revolvers. \u201cThe gunshots and fire should keep them back, but if they decide to attack there isn\u2019t much we can do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are the demons?\u201d I asked as I scooted back next to the fire.\n\n\u201cThey are\u201d he said as we watched the red eyes slowly start to creep up closer and closer to our fire. The Gunslinger would occasionally fire into the darkness to scare them back a bit but it would only last a few minutes before they started moving closer again. \n\nAfter what could have been hours or minutes, time is weird on that side, they attacked all at once. The Gunslinger let loose with deadly accuracy dropping demon after demon but there were too many. They were going to swarm us. I stood their useless watching them approach. \n\nThe Gunslinger reloaded his guns and yelled \u201cMake a torch using the fire. The demons hate fire!\u201d I grabbed a large branch out of the fire and held flame out away from me. I wish I had a gun. Those demons are not going to be afraid of a little stick with some fire on the end. \n\nThe Gunslinger moved back closer to the fire and unleashed hell with his guns taking out one after the other. He spun in all directions hitting anything that moved close enough to see in the firelight. \n\nA few made it past his bullets and ran towards us to attack. I held my torch out and swung it at the demon causing it to back up briefly. The small hesitation was enough for The Gunslinger to blow their head off splashing their green blood and guts all over me. \n\nThe darkness finally started to give way to sunlight and the demons disappeared into the desert. I don\u2019t know where the demons went since there was no place to hide out there. I was just happy to have survived their attack. We took a few minutes to rest and collect ourselves. \n\n\u201cTime to get moving,\u201d  the man in black said. \u201cWe got a long way to go to catch the train\u201d\n\nBefore we left I walked over to one of the dead demons near our camp. The Gunslinger had shot it right between two of its eight red eyes. It laid dead in the sand on its back with all eight of its legs up in the air. I looked closer and the demon looked like a giant diseased spider, larger than most dogs. I have always hated spiders and I was happy to see this giant spider demon dead. \n\n\u201cAre you some kind of God?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m no God.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThink of me as a delivery man. I am just getting you to where you need to be safely and on time.\u201d  \n\n\u201cI died didn\u2019t I?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cMore or less\u201d the man in black replied. \n\nWe continued to walk and I started to hear voices in my head sing a beautiful song \u201c[Come Aboard the Train. It\u2019ll be okay. It will be okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spMsCBc4jPU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=220).\u201d When I heard the lyrics a calmness started to pass over me. \n\n\u201cBut I am still alive?\u201d I asked. \u201cI could wake up and be alive again?\u201d\n\nThe man in black slowed down until I was walking beside him and he looked over at me.  \u201cSon, I\u2019ve seen your life and it wasn\u2019t pretty. Nobody should want to go back to that.\u201d\n\nI looked down. \u201cI can turn my life around.\u201d I lied, the same lie I have told my ex-wife many times before. \n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t no Disney movie kid.\u201d He said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to show you how your life could be if you made better choices. We both know what your life was like back there. That ain\u2019t no life son. That ain\u2019t no life at all.\u201d\n\nHe was right. When I look back at my life, I know I wasted the last few years of my life. I have lost my job, my family, even my kids hate me. I wasn\u2019t always like this. The hole I dug myself in was just too deep to climb out of. \n\nWe continued to walk in silence and I thought more about life. Could I change it? Could I survive the withdrawals this time? I have tried to quit countless times but withdrawals are worse than death itself. I held my head down low knowing the answer to the question I was asking myself. \n\nThe song in my head became louder \u201c[Come Aboard the Train. It\u2019ll be okay. It will be okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spMsCBc4jPU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=220).'' I've never heard anything like it, but somehow it made me forget about all the mistakes I had made in my life. It didn\u2019t matter anymore. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m always right.\u201d He said. \u201cLife isn\u2019t for everyone partner. If things had been a little different who knows what could have been.\u201d\n\nIf things could have been a little different. I thought about the car accident. If there was no car accident, I never would have got addicted to those pills. If the doctor would have weaned me off instead of cutting me off cold turkey, I never would have had to buy pills on the street. Then I never would have bought heroin. I would still have a job. I would still be married to my wife. I would still get to see my kids every day. If one small thing could have been different.\n\n\u201cHow much longer do we have? I asked. \n\n\u201cNot long, but we can\u2019t stop.\u201d He said. \u201cThe ghost train is always on time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that where the song is coming from?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cIt is. The song never fails to bring happiness to my face. It is beautiful isn\u2019t it.\u201d Said the man in black. \n\nUp ahead in the distance, I could see what looked like a building starting to appear.  \u201cThat is the station isn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d The Gunslinger said. \u201cThat is your final destination.\u201d \n\n\u201cThose things last night, the demons,\u201d I began to ask.\n\n\u201cThey would have taken you to Hell,\u201d said The Gunslinger. \u201cI am the protector of the dead. I walked this path alone when I first died and I make sure nobody else has to.\u201d \n\nIt took a minute to grasp what he had said. Suddenly everything felt real. I was dead. \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cFor saving me from Hell.\u201d \n\nWe approached the station and the song continued to play \u201c[Come Aboard the Train. It\u2019ll be okay. It will be okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spMsCBc4jPU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=220).\u201d I could see the train coming up in the distance and a wave of pure happiness overtook me. \n\nI stood next to The Gunslinger as the train to pull into the station. The Gunslinger handed me a ticket and told me to get on the train. \n\n\u201cDo I have to get on?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs it too late to go back?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ghost train leaves with or without you,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job was to get you here. What you do now is up to you.\u201d\n\nThe train doors opened and I was overcome with pure joy. The happiness I felt at that moment can not be described or experienced here among the living. \n\n\u201cAll Aboard,\u201d the conductor said as the train doors opened. \n\nI stood on the platform and saw the train was filled with my loved ones who had already passed on. I saw my grandpa. The man I saw as a hero. He was standing up front waiting for me to join him. I could not help but weep. \n\n\u201cNow Boarding! Last Call!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for everything,\u201d I said to the Man in Black. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cRoland,\u201d The Gunslinger said. We shook hands then he turned and walked away back and I stepped onto the train.",

            "comment": "Time works differently here, this empty path that shape-shifts into what the recipient considers a dear or important location in their last life. I know I met this person before, I recognize the now dry country-side pathway, the dirty almost black and white filter above everything, black painted plants shivering as the wind caresses them, once so colorful and lively, a joy to run through. A lone abandoned cart at my side, giving me a companionship as I wait for the dim light in front of me to widen, to get stronger.\n\nIt surely makes you wonder with each light. This specifically is simple, not as other as are adorned with lamps or candles holding them, different colors and intensities. This one, I can feel through my tired bones that's struggling. This person is fighting to live, which undoubtedly I have to give my biggest respects. The orange tone of it engulfes the colorless path and surroundings, the warmth coming from it attracting all sort of bugs and insects, which were now flying around me, I assume without the intention to actually bite, since they're just a memory, maybe a memory of annoyance in this case.\n\nI sigh and sit down as I look at the gray sky above me, a skinny hand shaking away the disturbing mosquitoes. \n\"It'll surely be a long walk...\" I told myself, knowing the journey that awaits for us ahead. The sorrows, the regrets, the good and the bad. For me, it was hell. Looking into my loved one's eyes as I wronged him, looking at myself cry and beg, disgusted at my creator as he punished me for something I was not entirely guilty of. My nose started to burn as I realize it's been too long since I stopped to think about my past. Realization also hit me that someone was staring at me confused. A tall man, dark hair, filled with blood and dirt. His grey eyes matched the atmosphere as his frantic breath was just starting to calm. How did I not notice him coming? And as he looked at his body, tapping it as if making sure he's entire, I just looked at him, the initial shock making me just stare agape. \n\n\"Wh\u2013... Who are you? Where am I? What's going on\u2013\"\n\n\"Calm down, child.\" And with effort, I got up. Even after all these years, although I don't age, my mental state is making my body decay. Weakened muscles made me struggle to do a simple action, yet I just smile at the man and his panic. Such a common thing, even for one that lived so many lives.\n\n\"Calm down?! What happened to me?\"\n\n\"You died.\" Simple, curt, short, straight to the point. You can say you get used to it after I joined so many in their journey. The sudden expression of realization and sorrow that filled his face made me hesitate. He was indeed a fighter, I knew. His eyes, stormy as the sky, were telling me that. I could hear his heart through the skies too, as it roared after a thunder, a storm approaching. I never said it was easy... \"I don't know how it happened, my dear, but let me join you through your journey, if you'd have me.\"\n\nSilence filled the air as he just looked everywhere. I almost wanted to let out a cry as his expressions never changed, even through all the lives he had. The same troubled face when he didn't get to do all he wanted to do. The same face of guilt. Even the same curiosity portrayed as he, even through his struggles, started analyzing me, searching in my eyes. I smile again. He always looked straight into my eyes...\n\nTaken back by the smile, I suppose, he calmed a little bit.\n\n\"I don't understand...\" Of course you don't. I never said he was the sharpest or brightest, but I have to give it to him, I didn't tell him much. I chuckled.\n\n\"Let me explain it to you as we start walking.\" I turn my head towards the forest far in our sight, path leading straight to it. \"For now, let's just being with your name.\"\n\n\"I...\" Still uncomfortable, confused, probably still frustrated, he looked lost and as a complete mess. He doesn't have to know how it is to appear here and not know what to do. He doesn't have to go through it alone. I'll be here, guiding you, preparing you for your next decision, yet something tells me it'll always be the same. You'll always go back, won't you?\nHe nodded to himself, straightening up as he looked in front, as if getting ready for battle. Tidying his bloodied hands on his now dirty shirt, his stunning eyes looked back at me as the skies calmed a little bit.\n\n\"My name is Adam.\" Well, now, if only he knew. \"...Are you the Reaper?\"\n\nA whole hearted chuckle left my lips. Such a ridiculous name that I heard way too many times. \"Oh, dear, no, I'm just a friend. But you can call me Eve.\"",

And yet, the entity standing in front of me calimng to be the reaper was wearing khaki pants and a blue polo. \n\n\"I'm sorry?\" I said, the scene around me not yet hadn't settled in. I could see myself still in my Fiesta, just barely trading paint with a 18 wheeler that had seemingly come out of control and gone over the highway barrier.\n\n\"I'm asking if you're ready to move on.\" he asked, gently smiling back at me.\n\n\"No! Of course not! Can't you put me back in my body?\" I could feel the adrenaline rushing though my... well, soul, I suppose. His smile faded for just a split-second, and was replaced by a subtle pained expression, as if he were recalling some hurtful memory.\n\n\"I'm afraid not...\" The smile was back, and I felt myself relaxing somewhat despite my bulging frustration. \"I can't change what happened.\"\n\n\"But I look just fine!\" I pointed at my stunned self back in my car, mouth agasp and nails haphazardly digging into the steering wheel. Apart from a dumb facial expression and a ruined manicure, I looked pretty well alive. \"How can I be dead?\"\n\n\"I stopped it so you wouldn't have to see what comes after. There's nothing more I can do. I am very sorry...\" He calmly closed the distance between us and held me, as if knowing that in the next few seconds my knees would buckle from under me and the realization would finally hit. \n\nI don't know how long I lay there on the ground, just a few feet away from my soon to be wrecked car, death's surprisingly warm hand on my shoulder, telling me that it was going to be ok.\n\n\"I never know how much it helps,\" he said \"but I know what you're going through, and I promise it does get better.\"\n\n\"How could you ever know how it feels like to die?\" I asked , still sobbing.\n\nThe pain from before showed again on his face, and it disappeared just as suddenly, as if by training, and the realization hit me.\n\n\"You're just like me, aren't you?\" I asked, \"You're human.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess 'was' is more appropriate,\" he said, scratching the back of his head and looking off into the distance for a moment, \"but I lived and died on this planet, much like you did.\"\n\n\"Then why are you doing this? Why doesn't God do it? Or Satan? Or something different?\" I asked, a bit puzzled.\n\n\"Well, if there are such things as God or Satan, I haven't met them. And to be honest, I'm not entirely sure how I'm able to it.\" He turned to me again and smiled, \"As for why, well, I didn't think you should be alone right now. Nobody showed up when my time was up, and I didn't find that was a good welcome into the afterlife.\"\n\nHe kept smiling, but I could see the pain in his eyes. \"I understand\" I said.\n\n\"So,\" he repeated \"are you ready?\"\n\n\"Yeah... I guess I am.\" I stood up, and he followed suit. \"Where are we going?\"\n\n\"You'll see! Don't worry, I'm sure you'll love it!\" he said, the excitement showing in his voice.\n\nAnd somehow, I believed him.",

            "comment": "I was weary. It\u2019s hard to imagine someone who is dead still being able to feel, but maybe the constant exposure to extreme human emotion had allowed me to still feel. I had wallowed in immeasurable suffering, but had also bathed in the light of someone surrounded by family, going to meet their god. I didn\u2019t know what was on the other side myself. I was the first human to die after all, betrayed and murdered by my brother, Cain. The centuries had worn away any resentment I could possibly still harbor. I wasn\u2019t prepared to die then, how could I have been? It hadn\u2019t happened before. Life was strange and lonely enough, my parents were always speaking of some powerful being they used to commune with in some garden, but we had no idea what they spoke of. Maybe that was the source of the light I saw when I died...yet somehow I knew that, although I was the first, I wouldn\u2019t be the last. And surrounded by the still fresh sensation of a brother\u2019s betrayal, how could I abandon those who followed?\n\nAnd so time went on. I could still see the material world to an extent, as I was drawn from one death to another. I saw it change and mature, and was excited for the future of my species, for we had come so far. And yet, we still had so far to go. Pompeii had shocked me to my core, it was difficult to transition all those souls to what lay beyond. So many at once, confused, unaccepting. It was always easier for those who were sick and knew they were dying, but this was unprecedented. And again later, uncountable battles, hundreds dying within minutes. If I was still bound by physical laws, I might\u2019ve tired, but I persisted, and guided them all, eventually. What I yearned for was the solution to my loneliness, but I knew that it would never come. The best I could do was to serve my kind, and ease their transition.\n\nUntil I met Brandon. I was first drawn to him one night when he almost committed suicide. I could sense his impending death, but he decided not to at the last moment. But what I saw shocked me. Brandon was truly a kindred spirit in loneliness. I could see that he had no living family, and no friends to speak of. Although time does not pass the same for me as it does for others, my free time is still limited, but I always found time for Brandon. I watched him, rejected by society for his mediocrity. Not smart enough to do overly well for himself, he was the definition of scraping by. Not charismatic enough to make friends or meet lovers, he scrolled through the routines of his life with minimal joy. Brandon went to work, went home, played some video games, made a sandwich or a microwaved dinner, and went to sleep to refresh his body to repeat this hell for another day. I was truly appalled. The variety of experiences I had glimpsed in his world, and here he was unwilling, or possibly unable, to see anything beyond the bleakness of his existence.\n\nBrandon\u2019s time inevitably came. I greeted him as a friend as his soul left his body. He looked down at it for a moment, but came to terms quicker than most.\n\n\u201cWhat got me?\u201d He queried aloud. \n\n\u201cHeart attack. Microwaveable meals and takeout are not the healthiest of diets. I\u2019ve seen this before, unfortunately you\u2019re not the first.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh.\u201d That was it, his entire reaction, possibly summing up the futility of his life, as he stared down at his lifeless body.\n\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t even really feel it, or, I don\u2019t remember feeling it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA mercy that many in history have not had the some fortune to experience, believe me. Are you ready for what\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nBrandon stood, silent for a moment. \u201cWho are you? Why are you doing this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was the first, so long ago. I stayed. Truthfully, I\u2019m not sure I realized what happened to me. It hadn\u2019t happened before you know. I didn\u2019t have the luxury of experiencing death second or third hand, and slowly accepting its inevitability. As to why I do this, all I truly remember was my loneliness here, in this place of transition. Not attached to the material, yet, unarrived at the final destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the final destination? Pearly gates, or maybe more of a courtroom judgement setting?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know. I cannot cross and find out. Perhaps that is my curse, but these people need someone. You accepted quicker than most, but perhaps that is because you had considered treading this path voluntarily before. Those who die unexpectedly are much more difficult to handle. Everyone goes eventually. I can only hope I\u2019m leading them to peace, and not torment.\u201d\n\nBrandon didn\u2019t even seem phased by this, he just stared through me with a strange expression. I could feel light and warmth behind me, the sensation that always precedes a decision to pass on from this transitional state. \n\n\u201cYou should go,\u201d he said. I started to move over to lead him before what he said sunk in.\n\n\u201cThat destination is not my path, but yours. You must go.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. My whole life, I was unable to do anything for anyone, not even for myself. My existence was bleak, but not truly miserable. I often felt misery, and sadness, but more than anything else I know your loneliness. I\u2019ve been immersed in it my entire life. I\u2019m just the quiet guy who works and goes home, only to show up the next day. I never could figure out how to make friends without bothering people, never could find the desire to even go out and try. But here\u2026this place...this feels like home.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t comprehend what he was saying. It made sense, but simultaneously felt like a dream, and I felt myself gliding backwards into the light. I realized Brandon was guiding me now, just as I had guided others. As the light began to surround me I looked back at him, this man who never did anything with his life, who couldn\u2019t, but in death, was able to free the one soul that in the millennia of human existence, had never found it.",

            "comment": "It was a normal Autumn day: overcast sky, a chill in the air and leaves of various colors strewn about on the ground.  The weather was fitting as a few dozen people gathered in the local graveyard to pay their respects and say their final goodbye.  The casket was lowered into the ground as the family of the deceased no longer could hold in what wanted so desperately to get out and cried in the arms of the other gathered.\n\nIt was a sight the man had seen many times over; he frequented these types of places as they were a gathering place for souls not ready to move on.  As many times as he had seen families cry from the deepest parts of their hearts, it was a sight never truly was used to seeing.  He took some comfort in this, figuring it would be best for what he did to never become cold to the feelings of others.  Within the crowd that stood by the grave, there was one that he had felt, one that drew him here.  A young woman stood behind the mother and father as they knelt on the ground, trying to stroke their hair and comfort them but failing as her hand passed through them.  The man approached the woman, \"Excuse me?\"\n\nThe woman was startled, she flinched as she looked in the direction of the soft voice that called to her, \"Wha...\"  She looked at the man who called out to her, tears streaming down her face.  \"They can't.....they can't...\"\n\n\"I know, I'm so sorry.\"\n\nThe woman kept trying, \"I need to tell them its okay...I need to tell them I'm...I need...\" Her voice wavered as she tried harder and harder to get the attention of her parents.  She turned to others in the crowd, hoping one would be able to feel her, to hear her.\n\nNothing worked.\n\nThe man tried to think of something to say.  He usually knew what to say to help the newly deceased, but there were certain times where he felt there was nothing he could say to ease the pain.  The deep sting of realization was something the could only be soothed with time, for there was no changing what had happened.  \n\nThe woman's panic soon calmed as she returned to her parents, collapsing onto the ground in front of them to look into their eyes.  She reached her hand out to her mothers face to wipe a tear, resting it as best she could on her cheek.  Her mother raised her hand to where her daughters hand was, oblivious to the contact her daughter so desperately desired.  The man walked toward them, stopping next to her.  He dropped down to a knee, \"She was precious to you?\"\n\nThe woman looked up to him, \"More than anything...I want to go back...\" Her gaze drifted back to her parents, \"I want to go back to them...\"\n\n\"I know.  I know it's hard.  It will continue to be hard but in time, \" he rested his hand  on her shoulder, \"it won't hurt anymore.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to do.  I don't want to leave them, I don't want to go.  I don't want to be alone.\"\n\n\"You will never be alone.\"  The woman looked up to the man, he stood and reached out his hand to her, \"I promise you that you  will never be alone again.\"\n\nShe stared at him, unsure.  He smiled as the sun broke from behind the clouds for but a moment.  Her hand still shaking, she reached up to grasp his as he helped her up from the ground.  There was a feeling of comfort that welled within her from this man's smile.  She was still very uneasy, but her hands stopped shaking as she wiped the tears from her face.  \"What do I do?  I don't know what to do or where to go or...\" her voice trailed off.\n\n\"Don't worry, I know a place you can go.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nThe man pointed to the horizon, \"A place far off.  A warm and loving place that lies under an eternal sun, full of many different folk, some whom I assume would love to see you again.\"\n\nThe woman looked over to the headstones that sat beside her, familiar faces and names etched into them.  She took a deep breath as she nervously rubbed her hands together, \"Will you show me how to get there?\"\n\nThe man smiled again, \"Of course.  I'll bring you there myself.\"\n\nThe woman looked back to the crowd and then to her parents.   She approached them once more and stooped down to kiss them each on the head one last time.  Her mother spoke, \"I love you...I love you so much my dear.\"\n\nA knot formed in the man's throat.  He tried to remember the last time he had heard those words spoken to him.  It had been countless years...he never, however, second guessed the help he offered to those like this woman.\n\nThe woman stood straight and looked at the man, \"...Okay...\" She walked up to him as the both turned to begin the journey.  He felt her grab his hand and hold tight, feeling a slight tremble in her grasp.  His grip remained firm, comforting both him and the woman.  The woman spoke, her voice still shaky, \"Thank you so much...\"  The man glanced over to her, \"It is my pleasure.\"",

There had been a myriad of various discomforts and noise all around before, but they had all vanished in an instant. Everything was still and silent. It was rather peaceful, in all honesty.\n\nThe third thing he noticed was the woman. \n\nShe had a familiar face, and she wore a more beautiful smile than he had ever seen. She extended a pale hand, and without a second thought, he took it. As he did, he found himself pulled into an unfamiliar landscape. A black, endless desert with an infinite, open sky. He turned to face the woman, who watched him silently, her smile unmoving. As he opened his mouth to speak, she did so instead.\n\n*\"Follow\"*, she said. Her voice was commanding, but gentle. He was compelled to go with her, and didn\u2019t pull away from her hand. Her hold was delicate, but was firm and reassuring that the same time.\n\n\nThey walked together across that desert, and as they did, he heard faint echoes of sound, and saw flickers of images in his mind. Laughter. Tears. A screech of tyres. Memories? He wasn\u2019t sure. They were quick to go as they had arrived. He looked over at the woman, but it seemed rude to bother her.\n\n*\"Some have further to walk than you do.\"* she said after a while. *\"Others less.\"*\n\n\nAs she led him, he felt the steps get easier, and he realised his body was getting younger. There were more noises and visions now, more distinct than before. He saw figures he recognises, and voices he knew. Fragments of the past. A meal at Sandra\u2019s. A school play about three weeks ago, maybe five. A halfway watched film. They too went quiet, and they continued walking towards the constant horizon. After a long while, or a short one, she came to a stop.\n\n*\"This is where I leave you\"* she said, a flake of sadness in her voice. She released his hand, and its absence left a strange emptiness inside him. This place was desolate, and save for her white garb and brilliant smile, very gloomy indeed. He cast his eyes over the landscape.\n\n\"It's very lonely out here, isn't it?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\nHe was a young man now, and his mind was filled with memories of school and wasted days. Old songs he\u2019d long since forgotten hummed for an instant. A faint flicker of a kiss passed by. Taking a few paces, he looked ahead, and there was no hint of anything but endless miles of sand and sky. Turning back, he found her smiling kindly at him.\n\n\"How will I know when I've arrived?\"\n\n*\"You'll know\"* she smiled.\n\n\"Will there be a tunnel? A light, perhaps?\"\n\n*\"Perhaps\"* was her reply.\n\nHe paused, and glanced around. It seemed the same in all directions, but he felt a tugging, pulling him to walk in the same direction he had with his companion. \n\n\"What\u2019s out there?\"\n\nHer only reply was a smile.\n\nNodding, he turned away from her, and, taking a deep breath, he walked onwards.",

It looks like this is it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe stood on at the center of a manicured green field that stretched off into the distance, flanked by lines of concrete and marble. In the distance stood a single white obelisk, rising against the backdrop of an impossibly blue sky. The sun stood shining at the center of it's axis, illuminating the straight lines and curved arches that signified civilization. The sirens blared continued to blare, flirting across the still surface of his consciousness. Only the discipline instilled over eons of solitude enabled him to maintain his focus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I suppose this is the best He's ever done - and He's been at it a long time too. 4 billion years, give or take a few dozen millennia. Not bad at all I suppose, better than His previous record by a fair amount.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe could almost feel the panic that had spread throughout every fiber of life on this world. He could almost feel the terror of impending doom that coursed through their minds like a river that had burst its banks. He could almost feel their disbelief and fear. Almost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It was too long ago now.\" He continued, \"I am surrounded by the strongest emotions my kind will ever know, that pungent flavor of life triggered by the certainty that death comes for it and the impossibility of preventing or delaying its passage, and yet I feel nothing. No mirror of emotion lies buried in my soul. No sliver of fear pierces the tranquility of my mind. Has it truly been so long since I've passed through those gates myself? Have I forgotten what it is to feel?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe cast his mind back, searching for that moment. The one he had revisited over and over and over again in his mind until it brought him nothingness. No pain, no regret, no anger or hostility, no desire for vengeance. Nothing except acceptance. He thought of his brother's knife and the justice of a god. The flash of pain, the passage into oblivion, and the blessing of his undertaking. A shepherd of sheep in one life and a shepherd of souls in the next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"If nothing else, the Man's got a sense of irony. I'll give Him that. He knows how to tell a story.\" He mused to himself, \"I was the first of my kind to die and will be the last to leave. The greatest exhibit of life's capacity for good becomes the nexus of it's destruction; even I have to admit there is a certain poetry to the conclusion of my kind. I was murdered by my brother's jealously, just as these states murder each other through fear of the other eclipsing their greatness.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first of the lights erupted in the distance, marking the birth of an anti-sun on the surface of the planet. It grew, higher and brighter, until a wave of sound and air and annihilation swept through the reality that blanketed him. A symphony of destruction buffeted the world around him, obliterating the banners of red lines and white stars that had come to represent the pinnacle of civilization.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the existence of a species transitioned into the death of all life on Earth, Abel stood on that field of green as it died  and directed the tide of souls up into their respective domains. Those that rose wept in joy, and those that fell wept in fear; but all of them wept for the necessary imperfections in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd as Abel continued his task, he felt the first hint of emotion flicker in his chest. \"Nervousness\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I wonder what happens now.\"",

            "comment": "I tugged at my sleeves, pulling them up to uncover the rotten skeleton I now am. Once, I was human. \n\nI rememeber the day I died quite well. It felt like I was still in the living world, but everything was grey. Dulled. I could touch things, but they wouldn't respond. I wandered my world, watching the living function and continue on without me. Eventually, I felt my pockets and found a small golden coin, brighter than anything else in my dull grey world. As soon as I held it, the nearest door glowed golden. Right as I was about to walk through, I heard a blood curdling scream. I hesitated, staring at the door, then pocketed the coin and ran in the direction of the scream. \n\nA young boy, maybe fifteen, had been on the wrong end of the goat he was trying to herd. His mother was curled over him while his breath became raspy, and other young boys chased the goat back towards the rest of the herd and away from the dying boy. I kneeled next to him, watching the blood drip from the corner of his mouth while his mother begged him to live. He looked like he was in so much pain. I didn't know what to do, how to help, but for some reason I reached out and put my hand on his chest. His breathing stopped, and he made what they now call a 'death rattle'. The last air in his lungs escaped, and he stopped moving.\n\nAs I removed my hand, his chest moved with it. I was confused, but continued to pull away, pulling him with me. Eventually, I stood with the boy in front of me, his bawling mother still curled over his body a foot away. \n\nWe didn't say anything. He looked back at his family sadly, then at me. I smiled at him gently, and gestured to his pocket. He pulled out the coin, saw the glowing door to the barn nearby, and looked back at me. I waved him over, told him to go. \"Waiting and watching will provide you with no gift but sorrow and grief.\" My voice echoed oddly, as though we stood in a giant cave and not out in the middle of a field. He nodded sadly, looked back at his mother once again, and walked away to the barn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then I have wandered, helping the lost find their way. It's always a gold coin, unremarkable but for its glow, and a doorway nearby. The door may not be human made, but made from branches or a fallen tree. Some souls fight me, wanting to make sure their family survives without them, or watching some sort of unfinished business. I always trail along them silently, letting them grieve as they do. Some souls go insane when they watch their family move on without them, and some find peace in it. It is not my business to tell them what to do, I just make sure they get where they need to be. \n\nAs the years went on, my skin rotted and my hair fell out. My body continued to decompose as it would, but my bones stayed upright. I continued on. I crafted a robe to cover my flesh as it fell, to keep from scaring the people I helped along their way. I learned that one the hard way, when a little girl reached to hold my hand and came away with skin from my finger. It was a struggle to convince her to walk through the doorway after that.\n\nBetween people, my afterlife was quiet. I couldn't help everyone as the human population boomed, but I helped who I could. As more time went on, I was less sure what was on 'the other side' and more afraid of it. I had control here, I was going to stay here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stared at my reflection in the lake, wondering how I could still see with empty sockets, how I could still feel with no skin. I rubbed what was left of my fingers together and the bones clicked as they touched. Lazily, I looked over at the young couple that were paddling across the lake. One of them had light coloured hair, maybe dirty blonde in the real world, and the other's was dark as midnight and fell to the middle of her back.The girl with light hair was slightly glowing golden, a symptom I had noticed in people who were going to cross over soon. I couldn't go in the water, only walk on top, so if she were to drown I would have to convince her soul to climb up and meet me. It was a horrible death, but at least she had me to help her. \n\nI walked alongside their boat as they slowed down and pulled out fishing rods. I groaned. Fishing could take hours, and the outline shows anytime from days to hours of death. At the sound of my groan, Light Hair jumped. I forgot that those close to death, close to the line, could hear me or see me if they were lucky. \n\nShe looked around, but her eyes slid past me. I had to step quickly to not be knocked over by the waves, which kept kicking up as the hours went on. The sky darkened and rumbled. This must be how she dies, I thought.\n\nHer girlfriend, Dark Hair, pleaded with Light Hair to take her back to shore, but Light Hair insisted that she was close to catching the big one, she was sure. A crack of lightning made them both scream, and Light Hair conceded it was time to head back to shore. I stared at the sky sadly. Her decision came too late., I was sure. Her glow got brighter the closer they got to shore. I had to jump and dodge around the waves now, as they didn't move with me and it would be very easy for them to knock me away. I made it back to shore before they did, slightly, and saw someone crouching beside their vehicle. This is interesting, I thought.\n\nThe girls, now drenched from the storm, pulled back onto shore giggling. \"I can't believe you kept us out in that!\" Dark Hair squealed. \"Yeah, but it was worth it.\" Light Hair's eyes dragged down Dark Hair's soaked body, her clothes plastered to her. They both laughed again, and went to get the car, to load the boat. I stood beside the crouching gentleman, wondering the story behind what was sure to be an anger fueled murder.\n\nI stood as Light Hair got close to me, and by now her glow was bright enough to hurt the eyes I didn't have. She gasped as she saw me, and the crouching man jumped out. He must have assumed she saw him. She screamed, but it quickly turned into a gurgle as his knife plunged into her throat. He stabbed her several more times while Dark Hair screamed. Dark Hair tried to pull the man off, and it seemed like she knew the man.\n\n\"Jonathan!\" She kept screaming. An ex lover? An angry family member? I was curious, but more concerned for Light Hair. She wasn't exiting her body on her own. I'd have to help her. I grabbed her hand, and pulled until she stood in front of me. She screamed at the sight of me, then turned and saw the scene I had been watching. She screamed for several minutes, collapsing in front of me before she calmed down. The crouching man stood away from the body, and Dark Hair collapsed over her. He stuttered some sort of apology and took off into the woods. I grabbed Light Hair's hand and pulled her up. \n\n\"What's going on?\" Her voice, whlie hoarse, still echoed as they always do in this world.\n\n\"You died. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Are you.. the grim reaper?\" Tear tracks ran down her face, and she sniffled.\n\n\"I suppose that's what humans call me. I go by Abel.\" Recognition dawned on her face. I pointed to her pocket, and she pulled out the coin. \"You can stay here, or you can go. I will not tell you what to do. But watching and waiting will do nothing but hurt you.\" \n\nShe looked back at her body, with Dark Hair curled protectively over it, and Jonathan long gone. Her voice was sad. \"Jonathan is Allie's ex boyfriend. He was convinced I 'turned her gay' and that she was going to go to hell. I never knew he hated me enough to kill me...\" Her voice trailed off, and she kneeled beside Allie. She reached out and ran her hand along Allie's face, but Allie didn't react.\n\nShe pulled the coin out again, and the car door began to glow. \"Is that where I go?\" She asked. I nodded, and walked with her to the car. \"What's after this?\" \n\n\"I don't know.\" I answered honestly. She grabbed the door and it opened for her. Inside, it wasn't the interior of the car, but just golden glow. She looked back at me. \"Thank you.\" I nodded again, and looked back at Allie, crying over the body of her lover.",

            "comment": "Death watched, as he always did, through the veil that separated the living realm from the afterlife. In simpler terms, it was more akin to a two-way mirror. \n\nAt this particular moment, he watched a young man, making his way through the crowds of people, shuffling past strangers. He would not see the sudden veering of the truck, or the passerby startled, rushing out the way; rather he was focusing on a phone call from--a device Death had learned was called a Bluetooth earpiece--and messing about with the tie he had been struggling with for the last few minutes. \n\nThe impact was astounding, the man flying through the air to land on the windshield of a nearby car, his legs bent at odd angles, his life force seeping out in a red, sticky mess. \n\nDeath took this moment to move between the veil and calmly stood amongst the civilians that looked on in horror. But, Death saw what they did not. The ethereal form of the soul, still maintaining the shape of his mortal flesh, propped forward and stared around, eyes wide with fear, confinement, understanding. \n\nHe immediately met Death's gaze, and Death in turn gave him a slight nod. The soul glided towards him, his hands fidgeting, hyperventilating if he had lungs, and a slight tremble to his body. \n\n\"I am Death, and I am here to escort you to the afterlife, if you like to accompany me,\" Death always attempted to make his appearance and voice as welcoming as possible, to better put the souls at ease, but it was hard with his skeletal figure, trademark black cloak, and voids of eternal nothingness. And his voice was too gravelly, too harsh. \n\n\"I... I, am I really dead?\"\n\n\"Of course. As you can see, attempts at reviving you will be all for naught. Death was on impact, which, in my opinion, is the best way to go. Traumatic deaths cause many souls to lose themselves and it takes quite some time to heal their fractured psyches.\"\n\nThe man stood, watched the police, the ambulance, the paramedics zip him into a body bag, the horrified onlookers. They stood, Death and a lost soul,  and it was many hours before the man turned to Death, nodded grimly and took the skeletal hand offered to him. \n\nTogether they walked into the unknown called the Afterlife.\n\nEdit: first prompt I've done here! I think I did... decent. Now off to find a prompt contest! (Anyone know of small groups of writers that do a contest style writing prompt... let me know please)",

It had been hundreds of thousands of years since he had began, but to him it all was a single instant and eternity all at once.  When your dead time ceases to exist and everything and nothing happens all at once.   But, the number of humans had slowed recently. It seemed there was a trickle where there had been an river before.  What happened?  The next soul beckoned from a distance.  This soul was further away than normal. The passenger was near a planet with no human inhabitants.  Normally the reaper was quiet but today he had to ask questions.  He said \u201chow did you get here?\u201d. And it felt odd speaking for the first time in a literal eternity.  \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I had just gone EVA to fix a component on the auxiliary FTL drive when I saw a bright light then you spoke to me....\u201d the man had realization \u201cthat light, im... im dead?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, but how did you get to this planet? No humans have lived here before\u201d death pressed the question.\n\n\u201cIm dead? Like done? No tomorrow? No alpha centari? No one is going to fix the drive? The drive! What happened to the drive?\u201d The new passenger meandered\n\nDeath retorted not with words but with a vision of the events that lead to his demise. First it showed an argument between a man and a woman it appeared they were in a control room of sorts with read outs and touch screens all around.\n\n\u201cHey thats my wife and Jim, what are they arguing about?\u201d\n\nThen the vision showed the man hitting a button the ship lurched and slowed and  the control panels light up. One read FTL OFFLINE in blinking red light.  The passenger entered the vision and the man feigned ignorance. The woman played along. \n\nThe passenger started putting it together his soul sunk \n\nThe next part of the vision was the passenger putting on his EVA suit and stepping out side, then the FTL drive light up white, then empty space and a corpse where there had once been a ship and the passenger.\n\nThe passenger began get angry but quickly discovered emotion played no role in the after life the best he could muster was a disappointed sigh \u201cassholes\u201d.\n\nDeath pressed again.  \u201cHow did you get there?\u201d\n\nThe passenger turned and said\u201d well we weren\u2019t supposed to tell anyone about our mission, but since im dead...\u201d  death leaned in to listen \u201cEarth had been destroyed by humans millennia ago we were on mars building ships for interstellar travel, turns out the moon Oberon had a lot of materials we could use for building ships.  We were based there.  We stole this ship and were headed out into interstellar space.  My shipmates, my wife\u201d,he said with disdain,\u201d and my best friend, were a part of the mission to reach humans beyond out solar system.  While earth had been uninhabited for a long time, we had colonized the system.  But what nobody knew is that our sun is beginning to go red giant.  Everyone will die if we dont.... well if they dont reach the humans in alpha centari\u201d\n\n\nDeath took this all in. And realized there must be other reapers in other parts of the solar system.

It heard no sounds, sensed no presence, felt naught but a gnawing chill at every surface of its exposed skin. \nIt tensed its throat to speak, to voice the growing torrent of emotions bubbling in its mind. It stretched its arms in front, desperate to touch another form. \n\nIt was afraid.\n\nIt did not know how much time passed when it first saw the white shape that danced in its frame of view.

The cloud fluttered and twisted, tendrils of black nothing, forming and disappearing at random. *A cloak* it thought and, it felt a small sense of pride in its discovery. It stared up and up the cloak and its eyes met the gaze of a skull. The skull, cocked at a slight angle, was peering down at it. The surface was porcelain smooth and even beautiful, it admitted to itself. Apart from the skull and hand, nothing was visible save for the pulsing, ever-changing form of the cloak connecting the two. The skull continued to stare at it. And then the figure slowly turned around and began lumbering away, down the path from whence the skeletal host had first arrived. It took some tentative steps toward the figure but the figure did not break stride. \n\nIt hastened to the figure\u2019s side and attempted to keep pace to which it noticed the figure slowing their gait. Step after step, it walked with the hand hovering rhythmically by its side. \n\nIt stretched a hand out and held the smallest finger of its ivory companion and the figure did not retract. \n\nAnd on they walked, one by the other, into the dark.",

The world around me ceased to be the vibrant landscape of the lush jungle greens, my vision filled with a misty grey void that seemed endless.

Evidently, it didn't matter as I eventually made my way to an immaculately white sort of palace. Standing there before me was a figure, tall and slim with flowing white robes that danced in a silent breeze.\n\nThe figure stood with a confidence I\u2019d never witnessed and their face shown pure delight as they began to speak. \u201cTell me, what is your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey call me John.\u201d I state rather subdued for the position I find myself in. \u201cCan you tell me where I am?

Unfortunately the world you know does indeed end, and this is what happens when you meet it.\u201d They looked at me intently and waited with patience for me to speak.\n\n\u201cYou mean to tell me, that I\u2019m no longer alive?

Believe me, I don\u2019t want to do this to you. You see your souls, what you are now, are very strong. They don\u2019t like being contained. So when I built the vessel you inhabit, I knew one day you would need to break free and return home. Today, you came home. And you were the first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t- What do I- What happens now?\u201d My pleading eyes beseeching answers from the being before me, wanting desperately to be told I could return to my family.\n\n\u201cNow you are free to roam the realm of the dead for as long as you\u2019d like. Here you will not want for anything, all your needs will be met, you cannot be injured or subjected to anything you dislike. Most importantly, you can always see below.\u201d With a snap of lithe fingers the air before me shimmers and reveals my family. My children. \n\n\u201cStella! Stella can you hear me!?\u201d I yell into the images, but if they notice they do not show it. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they hear me I can see them but they don\u2019t know I\u2019m here!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll not respond. You can see them yes, but you cannot interact with them. I am truly sorry, I know your kind handles lonliness poorly.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo this, this is my life now?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, but please don\u2019t worry there will be more of you soon. In the meantime, you can choose to be alone or you may spend your time with me. I will gladly speak with you night or day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing alone right now, I believe would be best.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand, I\u2019ll just show you to your room.\u201d\n\nThe palace was infinitely bigger than it should have been, but by this time I cared for little more than watching my beautiful daughters and wife. I missed them dearly. True to their word, within a week a new person appeared. Another man. I stood beside the being as they spoke to him. It was striking, the fear within his eyes. The first thing I saw was not his blazing hair or short stature, but the look of pure terror in his eyes as he laid them upon the being. Did I look the same? \n\nWhen their conversation was over, I took it upon myself to speak to him personally. It didn\u2019t go very far. He was struck with such grief, I feel I may never understand. Fortunately or not, he was not the last. The next was a young woman. \n\nShe made her way rather quickly, and as we gather outside to greet her we arrived at practically the same time. Her conversation with the being went quite the same as mine and the other man\u2019s, though the look in her eyes was new to me. It wasn\u2019t fear, it was more shock and loathing. She was torn away from the love of her life, forced to watch her move on without her. I suppose anger is natural, was I that angry?\n\nLooking back, the next arrival was the one that really pushed me over the edge. The next arrival was a young girl, no more than ten years old. She walked, ever so slowly, until she made her way to the land of the lost and froze before us and the being. She looked lost. She looked like she just wanted to wake up from the nightmare she suddenly found herself in. I couldn\u2019t blame her, I too was hoping this was nothing but a poor man\u2019s awful dream. \n\nThe being took extra care with this one, they sat with her and comforted the soundless sobs of the girl who cried out to her mother. She was so confused, she could see her mother and yet she could not make her hear her. All she saw was that of a broken woman who will never see her child grow. This time I know, I was just as lost as her.\n\nWhen the time finally came that the young girl was calm enough to be left with the other two souls, I aproached the being. \u201cWhy!?\u201d I demanded, \u201cWhy must you do that? Why must you take that poor girl away from her mother? She barely has enough sense to understand the wretched place she finds herself!\u201d\n\nThe being, to their credit, flinches at the words I throw. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, truly I am, that this must happen. You have to understand I cannot choose when a soul returns home. I cannot choose who or how, the most I can do is sit with them, comfort them, and give them a home to await the loved ones they so desperately wish to see again.\u201d \n\nI clench my fists in anger and spit \u201cYou want to comfort them? You haven\u2019t even the decency to lead them here! They wander for endless hours, scared and alone! How can you stand there and tell me you wish to help them when you won\u2019t even spend a moment to find them!?\u201d I harden my gaze and refuse to relent as they study me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot. I am poweful, yes, but only so far as the palace grounds. In the void beyond I am lost, and cannot risk losing my way. I am as much a prisoner as anyone. I do truly wish to help them, the souls that find me, but I cannot venture beyond these hallowed grounds.\u201d\n\nI open my mouth to retort before a thought strikes me, and I speak before I think. \u201cThe souls that find you?\u201d\n\nThey turn away from me, and with a flick of the rist the mist that ensnares the void begins to clear before my eyes. \u201cYes, those that find me. You see you were not the first to die, you were merely the first to make you way out of the void. You did not wander for hours, but for lifetimes.\u201d \n\nIn the absense of the mist, I see them. Wandering souls dot the area. They walk, or run, or crawl, all on their way to find any place but the vast emptiness of the void. They seek a final home, one that they cannot be led to. We look to eachother, the being and I, for a short moment. The pity in my eyes is clear, and they give a solemn hum in agreement. \n\n\u201cYou cannot leave,\u201d I venture, \u201cbut what of us? I have found my way here, am I able to return to the void?\u201d\n\nThey do not speak for a long while before gazing out into the vast nothingness. \u201cNo, I cannot in good conscience let you leave the palace grounds. What should become of me, should you be allowed to leave but are unable to return? Surely my regret would be immeasurable.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you do not know? In that case, seeing as I have still retained my free will, I\u2019ll set out on my own. I wish to help them, those damned lost souls, I wish to bring them to the true afterlife they deserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a kind soul, John, but I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m afraid that should you attempt this foolish mission, it will surely be the last I see of you for a long time.\u201d They look back to me with a seriousness that is entirely new. \u201cIf you can accept that risk, then you are free to go.\u201d Without another word the being vanishes.\n\nIt takes me what feels like two more days to ponder what I have learned. Every day, my mind tells me I must try to help them. It tells me, if not me then who? And with that I cannot argue. In the night, with the being knowingly watching from the palace tower, I make my way out into the sea of searching souls. \n\nI don\u2019t look behind me, fearing that when I do I\u2019ll confirm that I cannot find my way back home. I continue forward, until eventually I see them. The first soul I save. \n\nSuddenly they turn, and as if they can see me through the thick haze of the void, and they walk towards me. They smile, and when finally they reach me they stand unmoving. \u201cYou are glowing.\u201d He tells me, matter of factly, as he looks at me without fear. \u201cCan you take me home?\u201d\n\nI focus on my breathing, willing myself to stay calm. Gathering my courage, I finally turn around. Uncontrollably my face breaks out in a grin as I see the palace mere yards away from me. I turn back to face the gentelman and with a calm and reassuring tone I say \u201cYes, yes I can lead you home.\u201d\n\nAnd so I did, and so I still do. As I walk the void again searching for the next lost soul I like to remember the days after my arrival. The arrivals I saw, and how I couldn\u2019t stand to see the raw fear or devastation in their eyes. Now I take solace in the fact that I can prevent the souls from being frightened, I can help them understand what their life has become. \n\nMany have followed in my footsteps, or attempted to, but only I have ever been able to leave. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I am once again a shepherd. I have traded in my sheep for the souls of the dead, and I feel now at peace. So when that next soul looks up at me and says \u201cCan you take me home?\u201d I don\u2019t have to look back with fear in my own eyes as I answer that yes, yes indeed I can take you home.",

            "comment": "The last thing I saw before I died was a tall, thin man in an all black suit. \"How odd,\" I thought, \"to be wearing a suit in the California summer heat.\" \nThe last thing I heard was the deafening screech of metal on metal, and then\n\n\n\nthen, I woke up in a forest. The first thing that hit me was the scent of pine, and grass. And then, there was a gaunt, pale face above mine.\n\"Oh, good. You're up. We can go now.\"\nI sat up quickly. The weirdo in the suit! \nHe smiled. \"There, now.\" He extended his hand to me. Was I supposed to take it? \"What's...what's going on? Where am I?\"\n  \"Well, Annaliese....you've died. I am Death, and we shall be going for a walk now.\" \n \"I'm dead?\"\n \"Yes. Now, we must get going.\"\n\nAfter I got to my feet, we walked through the woods in silence for some time. Birds cheerfully chirped above us, and large, green ferns curled at our feet. I saw a few squirrels in the trees, chattering loudly. Despite our natural surroundings, it all felt surreal to me. Everything told me that, logically, this must be a dream, but.... \"Oh, no, ma'am. This is very real.\" I looked up at him. \"Yes, you are dead. Car accident. Brent- your boyfriend,right?\u2010 really shouldn't have been texting and driving.\"\n\nBrent! Fucking *Brent.*\n\nWe both fell silent again, minus the sound of leaves crunching under our feet. I looked up at Death and said, \"Er....\" \n Death looked at me inquiringly. \"Oh, right! I never said where we were. Trust me, you'll remember.\" \n\nRemember? I was...here before? Anxiety began to creep into my limbs, but I kept walking with him. After 10 minutes, we stood before a large, fallen tree. I saw something shiny nestled into a sideways tree root. \n\nHe nudged me. \"Go on. Go have a look.\"\n\nI nervously crept forward, and began to clear the debris. \"It's a birdhouse. But...I don't understand? Why am I here? Why.....\"\n\nDeath sighed, and leaned against the tree. \n \"The departed always have so many questions.\" I stared at him until he rolled his eyes. \"Pick up the birdhouse\"\n I nodded. The coppery paint shone in the sunlight, and as a beam hit my eyes, and it all came back. \"I remember-!\"\n\nHe nodded, smiling. \"I- I played here!!! These are the woods I played in as a kid! And this birdhouse-\" I lifted it up, looking at the childish signatures scrawled underneath it- \"I made this and painted it with my best friend!!\" It felt as though the sunlight had entered my soul, and was filling me. It was so overwhelming, that I began to cry. \n Death held me as I sobbed. Each happy memory of those childhood summers came to me, and after what felt like hours, the tears stopped. I looked up at him. He smiled gently.\n \"You have more questions.\"\n\nThe silence hung in the air, and then I said, \"Why did I come here? Is this....\"\n\nHe looked off into the distance. \"I was also a human, once. When humans die, our souls are supposed to find paradise. Our Paradise.\" The wind gently rustled the spanish moss that hung in the trees, and he cleared his throat before he continued.\n\"I never found mine. I had wandered so much, that I had seen and known all there was, and ever will be. And in that journey, I found other souls- and I decided to help them find their Paradise.\"\n\n\"So...this is mine? This is my Paradise?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"This is your place of rest. You will never want for anything. And, if you so wish, you can visit with other people.\" \n\"Visit?\"\n\"Well, of course. It wouldn't be Paradise if you had to enjoy it all alone. Besides, I think you'll find that you have plenty of people who are eager to meet you.\"\n\nI nodded, and rubbed my eyes. We both stood up. \nHe said, \"I think you'll settle in just fine here. Now, then, I must be going.\" \n\nJust before he set off into the trees, I yelled, \"Hey!\"\n He turned back.\n \"I know it isn't your idea of heaven, but....you're always welcome to visit! So come back soon!!!\"\n He smiled, and disappeared.",

            "comment": "I walked through the valley of the shadow of death, through turns winding and places so dark I couldn't see my own thoughts. And yet I feared no evil, for evil was done. Its hand print was already etched upon my skin, the hot thud against the back of my head tingling even now. But it was so cold in the valley. How strange, that a place with no wind might chill so.\n\nA glimmer caught my eye and I looked up; ahead of me was a gate, glowing in the void like the sun I had left so far behind me. A winding path beat up the vantic cliffs until it emerged from the shadows, vanishing under the ivory gates into a place where no gaze could penetrate. Was this it? Was this where I was supposed to be? I'd lost track of how long it had been since I had seen light.\n\n*\"Lo!\"* cried a booming voice, the sound reaching down the tall structure to where I stood in the shadows. I couldn't see who it belonged to. \"Who goes there? Speak thy name!\"\n\n\"I am called Abel!\" I cried back.\n\n\"Abel?\" the voice repeated. \"Surely you are Adam? We have not expected anyone for some time yet.\"\n\n\"I am not my father. And I am here unduly. I think... I suspect somebody caused me to die. That is, to end my life prematurely.\"\n\nThere was silence. I could almost feel the echo of what I had described radiating down upon me like an angry fire, blazing rage and concern at the gravity of those words. A human caused another human to end. Even to me, it was frightening.\n\n\"What you say is grave,\" the voice replied. \"I do not wish to believe it to be true and yet... here you are. Far ahead of your time. What tragedy.\"\n\n\"Who else has come this way?\" I asked. \"I passed through places dark and shadows deep.\"\n\n\"You passed through death,\" it replied. \"You are the first.\"\n\n\"Who else *will* come this way?\"\n\n\"All will come this way.\"\n\nI paused, glancing back the way I had come. Thoughts pierced my calm, of my mother and sisters walking through alone. Of children and old people who cried and howled in the darkness. \"What happens to me now?\"\n\nThere was no reply. I thought the speaker had gone away until the gate cracked open, the sides parting just enough to show a thin sliver of brilliant, white light between them. It was furious, but it did not burn me. The sensation of its warmth falling upon my face made me wish for nothing more than to draw closer.\n\n\"Now, you enter eternity.\"\n\nMy foot landed on the ground in front of me, but when I went to raise the other I found I could not. It wasn't stuck or being held, at least not by anything external to me. A thought had entered my mind that I couldn't banish; *all will come this way.* What horrors I had experienced. What terrible silences and sensations.\n\n\"What lies inside?\" I asked.\n\n\"I cannot tell you,\" the voice replied, \"except to say, that once you are within you may never leave.\"\n\nI turned around. Pitch black lay in the direction I had come from, but I could find my way back to Earth if I tried. It would be horrible, but I had already gone through it once. It wouldn't be so bad for me a second time.\n\n\"I'm going back,\" I said. \"I do not wish for anyone to walk alone again. I will be their shepherd.\"\n\n\"Then you will decay,\" the voice replied. \"The Light cannot sustain you without. Your skin will peel. Your muscles will fade. Your marrow will dry and you will be as the hollow bones under the earth.\"\n\nI nodded. \"So be it.\"\n\n\"Abel... this is not a fate to wish upon oneself. Surely the flames would be better?\"\n\nI turned, stepping back into the night. \"Loneliness and despair are equal partners to fire. I do not wish for my mother, father or siblings to come this way alone. I'll go wait for them.\"\n\n\"You walk into limbo!\" it warned, gradually fading into the distance behind me. \"If you turn back, you may never enter either of the worlds beyond. You will forever be a wayfarer!\"\n\n\"So be it,\" I said, a sad smile curling across my mouth. \"I shall be a shepherd to all, then.\"\n\nAhead I went, until the void wrapped around me like a blanket and the last shimmer of the gate disappeared. No sound, no sight, just a path in my still heart to guide a weary traveller, and the soft joy I felt in anticipation of seeing the Earth again. Of seeing my family.\n\nBut I would never be a guide to my brother.",

It's crowded here.\" I retorted to him, as he pushed past everyone around.\n\n\"I could make out that shaggy hair from a mile away John, you ain't fooling no one!\" I could barely make out his voice over the crowd, but he continued. \"Do you know what ride you wanna go on first? I heard the Wacko Wave Ride was the best one here.\" \n\nAdam smiled, patting my back. I almost forgot, it was my birthday, thats why we are here! Celebrating! \" Yeah! That sounds awesome lets do that first!\" \n\nIt was hours of enjoyment. The rides were laid out in a perfect line, the organizers made it bigger and better each ride. Before I knew it, we arrived at the end. The last ride. \n\nThe sun was setting, the hours of twilight were building but we were at the last ride, comically named, \"The Last Hurrah!\" It was so corny I could almost cringe, but looking at the loops you could tell it meant business. \n\n\"Man, the time really flew by didnt it?\" I asked.\n\n\"No kidding, I thought the lines were gonna be so much worse.\"  He replied.\n\nLike normal, we got on the ride. It was around the moment I realized, the line was really short. \"Thats strange... It only took a few secon-.\" But I was cut off, the bar to the ride coming down. But I shrugged the feeling, didnt think much of it and turned to Adam. \n\nAdam was beaming, almost salivating at the loops. \"Oh my god! This one is gonna be awesome! I cant wait!\" His attitude must have floated to me, I smiled and nodded and we set off. \n\nThe ride was long, twists, turns, loops and corkscrews. It didnt seem to end. After what felt like minutes, I turned to Adam. \"Hey... Thank you. Thank you for coming to my birthday.\" \n\nHis face lifted to a big smile, \"John come on man. You were my best friend for twenty years. How could I not?\" \n\nThe ride was over. We stood before the gate. The crowd was gone. I turned around and the park was gone. It was just us. My body froze, skin tingling as I turned back to Adam, a tear in his eye.\n\n\"I'm sorry John. I hope you had a nice birthday...\" \n\nJohn smiled back, he knew now. A tear ran down his cheek as he closed his eyes. \"Thank you. It was the most fun I ever had.\" \n\nAdam wiped the tear off his face as John vanished, the persona vanishing along with him. Flipping the hood of his robe up, he turned around, and began his walk back. \n\n\"Steve! Dude! Its been too long!\"",

I feel the fear washing over my face. Sending a tingle down my spine. My face is wet my chest is heavy. What is this? Am I lost? \n\nI lay there for an eternity. I can't wait to get my revenge. I'm so fucking COLD! I feel as my flesh wept away. It was not painful. It was suprising as a blanket get torn away from your warm body, facing the harsh, brisk winter night. I claw at my under flesh and pull away my bone to warm myself from this dark cold wasteland of nothingness. My leg bones grow back. Again and again. No matter how many times I disconnect them from my waist. I sit in my dark, cold, wretched borrow my Father has forgotten about, next to my pile of disjointed leg bones and start dreaming of what I would do to my brother that put me in this cave of despair. Carving a sharp tool we used to cut the fields from which we eat from. Every bit of time that passes is a second I feel less and less cold. I feel less time, less desire. My hands, no stripped of their flesh have no feeling. White as the smile I once beloved from my mother.\n\nMy tool, now fastened to the stick made of my bone has a faint glow to it. It stands awkwardly. I had to carve them to join together like pieces of lumber cut from the All Giving Tree. Little creases to hold them together. As I grab my tool the void of my Grim wraps it self around me like a ploom of smoke. Almost like a child clinging to his mother soes not to be abandoned. With my tool firmly in my desolved lifeless hands, it wears something on my hand. It looks like a symbol. Its warm. No... it's hot! I try and let go, I can't! \"Get it off!\" I yell to no-one. I swing the tool in an attempt to knock it out of my hands. It grabs the nothingness like a piece of parchment and tears it. The burning stopped and I see a man and a woman. Both elderly, holding each other as they close their eyes at the same time. A light of a reflection of them fall. I watch them start to lose the light. I chase them as I see their bodies lay there. I reach my hand out to see the fear on their faces. They reach back, \"please! Help us!\" They see my face and scream and retract their hand. The hand I'm reaching for starts glowing. Suddenly we stop. We are elevated with no barring. This is nothing like my Grim. This is the heavens. The night heavens. I look around everywhere. I see an eternity of light dots and its beautiful. The couple seems at ease after they take in the same view I am. \n\n\"Who are you?\" The man almost whispers to me in this infinite silence. I'm taken aback. I haven't heard another person's voice for as long as I can remember. \n\n\"I.. I don't know. I'm from the Grim. It's an infinity, like this except mine is darkness and much more cold.\" My voice is harsh and not the one I remember. It echoes, like Father's used to. \n\n\"Well, Mr. Grim, what happens to us now?\" The man asks, as if I had the answer. \n\n\"Come with me\"\nI take their hands and I start moving towards a nothing. Suddenly the nothing becomes brighter and brighter. The man and the women are gone and I am touched by a warmth so deep, it reminds me of the soft touch of my mother when I was a boy. \nSuddenly, a horn sounds. It starts soft, then gets louder. And louder. And louder. Before long I cant take it. I wave my tool to escape, nothing happens. Then, just as suddenly as the horn started, it stopped. \n\n\"YOU HAVE DONE WELL. THIS IS WHO YOU ARE NOW, GRIM.\" The voice was so loud, I felt it as if it was a dream. \n\nThen I was back. My Grim. No. Please. I can't be toyed with like this. My hand starts to burn again. \"I will not do this! I will not be what you want me to be!\" The pain increases. It doesn't stop. Soon its through my whole body. \"GET OFF ME!\" I swing my hands and the Grim rips in two. I see a child. It isn't crying. It is blue. Why is it blue? The women holding the child is screaming at the lifeless corpse. A light drops from the body. After I catch it, I scream, \"Okay. If this is what I have to do to protect them from the Hell you put me in, so be it. I'll do it!\" \n\n\"IF YOU FAIL, THEY WILL FACE THE SAME FATE YOU HAVE. THE SOUL MUST BE GUIDED.\"\n\n\"Yes Father. I understand now.\"",

            "comment": "It was a cold night, and Dana had just died. She was standing in a grassy little field, in a small part of a large city.  \n  \nBefore her was a shrouded figure, whose every feature was made of the stuff between stars. Darkness incarnate.  \n  \n\"Ah shit.\"  \n  \n**GOOD, YOU UNDERSTAND.** The figures voice was soft and deep like distant thunder. He produced a scythe, so visibly sharp it shivered the eyes. **THAT SAVES US SOME TIME. COME WITH ME.**  \n  \n\"And if I don't want to?\"  \n  \nThe figure leaned down slowly, eye level with Dana. Nothing could be seen beyond his hood. **HOW RUDE OF ME. ALLOW ME TO REPHRASE: MAY I SHOW YOU TO THE AFTERLIFE?**  \n  \nDana considered, attempting to haunt some strollers in the park. She couldn't so much as knock an ice-cream cone out of a childs hand. She wasn't able to fly either, though it made little sense that gravity should bother with spirits.  \n  \nLess spirited without the prospect of a good haunting, she sighed. \"Lead the way.\"  \n  \nThe two set a walking pace through the city. They passed through buildings sometimes, as Death desired. Othertimes they would follow the streets, glancing through taxis with angry drivers, children sleeping in the backs of minivans with bleary-eyed parents, blurry figures huddled around a rubbish-fire. A domestic argument, a lonely pregnant woman watching television, a man ceremonially donning a business suit, mice in a cupboard. A shadow of a girl slipped between streetlights, following a young boy with gel in his hair.  \n  \n\"So you mentioned that, because I knew I was dead the moment I saw you, it would save us time right?\"  \n  \n**RIGHT.**  \n  \n\"Are we in a hurry or something?\"  \n  \nDeath shrugged. **NOT PARTICULARLY.**  \n  \n\"Cuz if we can walk in a straight line, this route seems sort of roundabout. Where in the hell is the afterlife? Thought it was just straight up.\"  \n  \n**IT'S NOT A VERY DIRECT ROUTE. THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I CHOSE TO STICK AROUND.**  \n  \nThey passed a merry-go-round with the lights out; it was after closing at the carnival.  \n  \n\"Ah.\"  \n  \n**TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF, IF YOU LIKE.**   \n  \nDeath would nod and respond as she told him. About her troubled youth, the time when CPS came, dropping out of high-school, working minimum wage well into her 30's, and selling tons of drugs on the side. She told him about Andy Pilgrim who kissed her cheek in 1st grade, how on his 16th birthday they rode a ferris wheel together, when he got married to a girl out of state, how she never really moved on but could never see them actually getting together. And every good and bad time between 1989 and now that she could remember.  \n  \nTireless, they traversed multiple state lines. They passed a deserted drive-in theater, a long and winding interstate, a sleepy town with a family pharmacy buy 2 get 1 free, a missing cat poster, a lake which held the shadows of fishermen in it's wide palm, a graveyard whose stones had weathered rain for nearly a century, a Motel 6 whose 't' had burned out or perhaps had been struck by a rock.  \n  \nThey passed a food truck busily serving late night patrons as Dana asked, \"What about you?\"  \n  \n**THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SAY, REALLY.**  \n  \n\"Don't be modest, you're Death! With a capital D!\" They walked down the pier, a ferris wheel loomed against a starry sky.  \n  \n\"How long have you been ferrying souls?\"  \n  \n**SINCE THE FIRST HUMAN DEATH. AN ANTHROPOLOGIST TOLD ME ONCE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEARLY 66 MILLION YEARS AGO.**  \n  \n\"Woa,\" Dana let that number sink in. \"So he was a caveman right?\"  \n  \n**HE DID NOT LIVE IN A CAVE, BUT YES.**  \n  \n\"And this was you right? You said you stuck around.\"  \n  \nDeath turned. **YES, QUITE PERCEPTIVE OF YOU.**  \n  \n\"You speak English fairly well for a 66 million year old caveman.\" Dana winked and punched his arm, friendly-like.   \n  \nHe didn't laugh, but seemed to appreciate the gesture anyway. **LOTS OF PRACTICE.**  \n  \nThey walked to the end of the pier, where the guardrail protects pedestrians from a 20ft drop into the water. Death and Dana stepped onto the open air as if they had done so all their lives. **IS THERE A LANGUAGE YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN?**  \n  \nThey walked into the horizon, above the ground, in a straight line. They continued on in just the same casual stroll, walking into space while the world spun away.  \n  \nThe length of their conversation could not possibly be measured, nor their journey. Though on this journey it is worth noting that Death, the first man who had died, chose Ator as a true name. Posthumously, of course, for he had no name in life.  \n  \nThey came to a small platform, in a place where all the stars were behind them.  \n  \n**HOPE I DIDN'T RUIN THE SURPRISE.**  \n  \n\"You mentioned it would be underwhelming. So i just step on it?\"  \n  \n**YES.**  \n  \n\"And where does it take me?\"  \n  \n**I HAVE SEEN FIRE, LIGHT, FEATHERS, RAINBOWS, TENTACLES, PEARLY GATES, CLOUDS, LIGHTNING AND ALL MANNER OF THINGS EMERGE FROM THAT PLATFORM. IT TAKES YOU WHERE YOU WERE MEANT TO GO.**  \n  \n\"Well, I suppose it's time.\" She embraced the specter known as Death, as Ator. \"I... Thank you, so much.\"  \n  \nHe held her gently and brushed a tear away. **YOU ARE VERY WELCOME. THE JOURNEY IS HARD WHEN YOU ARE ALONE WITH YOUR THOUGHTS.**  \n  \n\"And you have to walk back...\"  \n  \n**I KNOW THE WAY. AND I KNOW MANY SONGS.**  \n  \nDana let him go, and walked to the platform. She held her breath, stepped onto it, and stood, waiting.  \n  \nFor a fair while.  \n  \n**THAT'S A NEW ONE.**  \n  \n\"Maybe it's not my time?\"  \n  \n**PERHAPS.**  \n  \n\"Well we'll always return to Earth just in time for the next death right? Time is kinda screwy for us, right?\"  \n  \n**IN ALL MY YEARS I HAVE NEVER UNRAVELLED THE MYSTERY OF MY PERCEPTION OF TIME.**  \n  \n\"So... You ever check out any cool planets?\"",

            "comment": "Instead of the rich vegetation and dirt floors he was used to, this place was different. The sun was no longer held in the same place. It was gone entirely, but he could see just fine. The air seemed thick and heavy. Everything seemed to be a shade of black, even though there was still color surrounding him. The sky was filled with stars, but instead of beaming light, it was as if someone poked holes through a pure black canvas that wrapped around the sky. He took a deep breathing, feeling the heavy cold air fill his lungs\u2026 But he realized there were no lungs to fill. He did it out of habit, and would continue to do so. \n\nHe looked down at the ground where he would lay. His body was still there, even in this place. As he looked around he couldn\u2019t help but feel confused. He somehow understood he was dead. What he didn\u2019t understand was why he was still there. He started to head off into the vegetation. He didn\u2019t have to worry about being slaughtered by beasts anymore. Or what he feared even more, hunger. \n\nAs he walked through the vast landscape, he realized that the world seemed no different, other than the shades of black that was draped around every plant, stone, and animal he saw. Life moved on without him, and while he never expected anything less this, this did upset him. The small more timid beast would no longer run and cower when they heard footsteps disturb the earth he walked on. Maybe because they no longer actually disturbed the earth he walked on. \n\nAs the days rolled past, he continued to look and search for something, but the longer he stayed in the awkward and bizarre realm, the more he became familiar with it. He didn\u2019t quite understand it but it almost resonated with him. He lived his life alone, and after he died he discovered that alone was what he was meant to be. However, alone is not the right word for this place. Being alone is not having a person around you. This place was different. This place had nothing. He could watch the beasts roam around and continue with their lives, but no matter what he could never interact with them. He could scare them, or hunt them. He just watched them as they continue on with their simple days. \n\nHe was placed on this earth many decades ago without purpose. He's never had a reason to do anything, and very little want to discover one. He would just struggle to stay alive. He would hunt to eat, but he never found pleasure in it. He tried to just pick the fruits off of low hanging trees, but even that felt like he was ridding the world of something. He realized that to live was painful. Many hard choices you never want to make but you do so just so you can be not dead. He never cared for it, but he would rather be back at the old place instead of this new one. This new dark place start to feel like home to him, but it held a tone in the air, one he could almost taste. This tone reeked of familiar belonging, but never in a good way. He didn\u2019t understand it yet but he would come to. \n\nA few months have gone by at this point, and he saw the first man. This was the first man he has ever seen. He never realized how ridiculous he looked when he chased after beasts just so he could live for a few more days. He watched this man all day. At least he assumed it was day, since the more sinister beasts like to prey on those with lesser eye sight like him.  This place never held a time. It actually felt timeless, even though he could see that time never stopped. \n\nAfter the man hunted, and tore several large pieces of flesh from the body, he walked through this tame land. He watches as this man walked with purpose. He never noticed before, but it was a walk similar to a mother beast, caring for its young ones. The man reached a small clearing under the canopy of the trees, and in the clearing was another person, but one who looked different. The ongoing observer recognized her motherly features and decided this was not a man, but a woman. She had a bond with the man and they cared for each other. It was something the observer never had.Thats when he realized how cursed he really was from day one. He was never given a purpose, while these two did. He decided that this emotion he felt was too much, and it was time to find a new place to look over, or even leave this realm al together. \n\nHe never found a better place to go. He wanted to leave this place all together, but he didn't know how. Every so often he would think back to the man and women. Why did they move with so much will? They cared for each other, but it was such an unfamiliar concept to him. If it was so unfamiliar, why did it bother him so deeply? He would occasionally go back to the man and women and watch. She would beat back the vines and saplings that grew into their passing while he hunted. She would build a fire for him and pick fruits while he cooked for them. At night he would get up to fuel the flame, and look around for sinister beasts that might attack.\n\nWhy did this spectator hate watching them so much? They acted no different than the beast he would watch at all hours of the day. What he assumed was day. These pinhole stars gave him no satisfaction, only a bizarre timelessness. They couple would couplate on nicer nights, and it would fill the observers veins with rage. Why could he never experience something on this level?\n\nSoon they had their first child, followed by more. The family started to grow and their sense of worth would grow alongside with it. The spectator became dull to his emotions, but he always hated that he could never feel something like this. He tried to leave this realm many times, but its thick air always held a curiosity to it that always left him unsatisfied. \n\nHe started to walk all corners of the earth. He would swim for years in the ocean, stay deep inside caves. He learned everything there was to learn. He soon learned that there was nothing left on the earth other than this pinhole sky realm. He knew that there was nothing after that. It's just where you come to reflect on your life after it ends. Once you're done reflecting, you dissolve into nothingness, to feed the every growing shades of black. So why wouldn't he leave?\n\nHe soon saw himself back towards the family. There was a roaring fire, bigger than he's ever seen. So why did all the children and the mother look so sad? They looked like they had lost their purpose. He soon discovered that they did. For now anyways. Glooming of the fire was the man. He was looking into it, but he seemed to be different. When the lost spectator would look down onto his limbs and his body, he would see hes former self, just wrapped in this sickly shade of black and nothingness. But looking onto the man, he appeared to be made of the same color was stuck behind the pricks left in the sky. It was a dull white. It didn't shine, but it was light. It was wrapped around him as if someone rolled him in ash. This spectator knew he was in the same realm as him, and just as soon as he laid eyes on him, the former man laid his on the shaded observer. \n\n    \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\n    \u201cYou\u2019re no longer living\u201d\n    \u201cI\u2019m dead?\u201d\n    \u201cI believe so\u201d\n    \u201cSo what now?\u201d\n    This frustrated the man shaded in black. He always thought he would be gone before another soul entered this realm he called home. This place was a place to make peace with whatever cruel thing life did to you. He should have been gone before someone else entered, so they could reflect and realize what life was worth, and how death, no matter how terrifying, can be a gift. Life gives you many beauties, and death makes you appreciate it. Death is the only driving force that life needs. So why has he come to discover this, but never moved on? There was no more reflecting for this man, he just wallows in his own self-pity. \n    \u201cNow you reflect. Appreciate life, and miss it. Then appreciate death\u201d\n    \u201cIs that what you did?\u201d, the new soul was very curious and felt he needed many answers. This upsetted the man shaded in black some more. \n    \u201cI did so all by myself, without so many questions\u201d\n    \u201cSo why are you still here?\u201d\nThis was the question that upsetted him the most. He wasn\u2019t filled with rage. He realized that he was the first to be gifted death, and even though he learned to appreciate death, he never appreciated that he was the first to die. It made something click for him. Just as death is required to appreciate death, it's the same reversed. However, this man was never gifted life, he was just simply alive. He fed himself, and found small pleasure, but he had no reason, no driving force. Why was this other man gifted a woman, but not him? A family, but not him? \n\nHe looked into the fellow souls eyes, and say nothing but confusion and dissatisfaction. He then realized what it was about the air here that felt so familiar. Every person is to die, and every person is to hate it. They are to feel lost and lonely and sad and every other emotion that no one should feel at this time. This is a time for appreciation, and nothing more. The first to die realized this. And he understood why he was the first to die. He was never given a life, so he could appreciate death even more. It was simply his goal to live in this shaded world, and to help those that are brought to it. No one should ever be alone in this place, and he understood that better than anyone. \n\n    \u201cCome with me. Tell me about your life\u201d.",

I've never been good at comforting older people, and this gentleman looked around 66, maybe a few years older.\n\n\"Go? Am I dead?\"\n\n\"Its not always as bad as it seems.

He couldn't touch the water.\n\n\"You can't swim, let me take you to flat land.\" I took him by the hand and floated over to the nearby sandy beach just as an ambulance and 3 police cars pulled in. An unfortunate waste of time, for them, I thought. I wish I could tell them that I already had it under control and that I'm taking him to a better home, but of course, I can't.  Its been ever so harder through out my existence to watch the mortal world. I could have warned the Jews and the Allies of The Nazis. Warn JFK. Evacuated in the Twin Towers. Stop the Korean war. Yet I can't, I've been dead since the very beginning. Its hard not remembering the people I meet. Only the important or famous ones. Buzz Aldrin was one of my personal favorites to escort. He was calm about it and was acknowledging that it was his time. The worst memory I have of taking an escort was of a Japanese man named Shinto Korugeshi. He was a navy man and had just managed to escape on a life boat from the American fleats. He saw the heavy planes with names and heard from an American soldier in his ship of the Bombing of Hiroshima. Just about 4 miles away from the Japanese shore line his boat sank from the damage it already sustained and he drowned, hours before the planes arrived. Seeing him there as he just screamed knowing he could have evacuated the civilians tore me up inside more than anything ever has. It makes me wish more and more that I could just keep people alive.\n\n\"What's it like to be dead after a while?\"\n\n\"For me? Painful. The afterlife isn't meant to have pain. Physically.\"\n\nThe man looked downwards as he took in a few thoughts.\n\n\"I wish I had better words to say for that.\"\n\n\"Heh, thanks.\" He scooted closer to me just as the stairway rolled down. I slowly walked up there. \"Come on now, I'm sure a lot of people would like to see you again.\" The man nodded and we shuffled up the stairs into the clouds, as I looked back at the blood filled water and the mourning family.\n\nIt was time I get some help with this.",

He had noticed I had nothing of value to offer him. I wasn't carrying any money with me and wasn't wearing anything of value he could take. Next thing I noticed, was this knife in my chest as he stole my shoes an made a run for it. But, after a while, I started to feel lighter. \n\nNo effort was spent while standing up. This felt weird. I stare at my chest in search of the knife. However, I find none. Furthermore, my body looks transparent. Then, a sudden thought crosses my mind.

This was just too much. How could I be dead? There was still so much I wanted to do! Watch my children grow up, finish my book, going on a world trip with my wife when we were both retired... I try to take another peek at my now dead body.\n\n\"I wouldn't stare at it, if I were you. It gets worse the longer you have contact with it\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\", I tried to be as polite as possible, but this supposed \"Death\" was getting on my nerves.\n\n\"The more a soul has contact with parts of his previous life the more rapidly it disintegrates.\"\n\n\"I feel fine so far. Can't you just leave me be for now?\", as I uttered this words, a small crack appeared in my hand.\n\n\"Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?\"\n\n\"Alright, you win.\"\n\nI hesitantly start moving away from the place of my death. We walked around somewhere the end of the street, the body could barely be seen from here. As I stood against a wall, I realize something. He was still next to me.\n\n\"Don't you have other souls to guide? I can't be the only one who died.\"\n\n\"I just help the souls I find. I can't be everywhere at the same time. Besides, don't you want to go to the afterlife?\"\n\nThe only thing that followed his question was silence. Afterlife sounded nice, for sure, but I felt like there was still so much left undone. I couldn't just go to the afterlife right away. Death turned at me and sighed.\n\n\"Being obsessed over your old life won't do you any good now. There's nothing more to do but to move on.\"\n\nI was starting to get annoyed,\"What do you know?! It's not like I can just accept this this easily!\"\n\n\"I was in your shoes once. Like I said, we are both drifting souls. And believe me, chaining yourself to your previous life like this, will only make you disappear. If that happens, you can kiss your afterlife goodbye.\"\n\nHis words carried a heavy weight. Everything was too much of a mess right now...\n\n\"But, there has to be a way to go back right? Please, tell me there is!\"\n\nIt was his turn to remain silent. Nothing more needed to be said. Against all of my wishes, I start crying uncontrollably. I can't really say how long it lasted. Only that, when I was finally finished, the sun was already up and my old body was already being carried away. Death sit himself next to me.\n\n\"You know, I died in the middle of a hunt.\", I comment nothing and stare at the ground while he talked,\"Our tribe was growing hungry and we needed a lot of food. Fast. So, we tried to take a bigger prey than usual. We managed to kill the darned thing, but it collapsed over my person, crushing me instantly.\"\n\n\"You hunted elephants?\"\n\n\"No, no, no. This is way more back. It was a mammoth.\"\n\n\"...How old are you exactly?\"\n\n\"Don't really know how to count. But by my estimation... a lot.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I'm surprised you can even speak my language.\"\n\n\"When you meet so many people while you travel the world, you start catching on a few things.\"\n\nI look up in thought while staring at the now blue sky. My thoughts feel clearer, at the very least.\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"So, ready to move on?\", he stands up, patting his robe.\n\nMove on... It still is an appealing idea.\n\n\"Hey Death, do you mind if I delay that afterlife thing for a while?\"\n\n\"For how long?\"\n\n\"About a week or so.\"\n\n.....................................................................\n\n\"Are you sure about this?\", he asked me.\n\n\"I am.\"\n\nWe were both in tuxedos that Death got us god knows how and were walking towards our destination. Death was also wearing a fedora that was tilted in a way to cover his face. Guess I wouldn't get to know how he looked like. We start seeing a lot of cars parked along the street.\n\n\"We're close.\"\n\n\"We can still turn back. It's not too late.\"\n\n\"Well, this is my decision. My mind is already made up. You don't have to come if you don't want to.\"\n\nI could hear Death give a small chuckle,\"Nobody should be left alone at their time to go. No matter in what way.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself.\", I answer while grinning a little bit by instinct. It didn't take long to arrive to that place, with its big iron gates.\n\n\"Haven't been to one in a long time.\"\n\n\"Feels weird hearing Death say that, considering it's a cemetery.\"\n\n\"Believe it or not, it is one of the places where I find less souls so it usually isn't worth coming here that much.\"\n\nWe pass through the gates and, in the distance, we could see a funeral take place.\n\n\"Last chance. I can just guide you out of here right now if you want to.\"\n\n\"I pass.\"\n\nI start walking towards it, with Death following. Lucky for them, there were two vacant seats at the furthest corner of the funeral. More ahead there was a picture of me and a coffin. The crack in my hand starts spreading. Thankfully, Death didn't seem to pay it any attention.\n\n\"I've known him since high school. He was quite the troublemaker and I had to bail him out on several occasions. But, in the end, he was still a good man who always put his family first. I have nothing but respect for him.\n\nI guess I can finally understand when they say that the good ones are the ones that go too soon.\"\n\nHe stepped out of the podium.\n\n\"Feels weird...Watching your own funeral...\", damn, it's getting harder to focus, my eyes are starting to get blurry.\n\n\"Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"I might\", I take a long breath before continuing,\"need you to be my eyes now.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jesus Christ! Hang on there! Look! Your wife is next!\"\n\nI try to focus my vision to get as clear as a picture as I could. There was no mistaking that golden hair.\n\n\"I worked part-time at a restaurant when we met. At first, he always appeared with his friends at first, because he was scared of talking to me alone.\", everybody laughed briefly,\"But, after a while, he started to come in alone. And you\n\nknow what he always asked? A glass of water. I fell for his sorry attempts at trying to invite me out, as much as I'm embarrassed to admit. We had two great kids which I wouldn't trade for anything in the world.\", one of my arms got loose and fell to the ground, and I could start feeling cracks appearing all over my body,\"If there was one thing I regret doing, was not telling how much I loved him the day he went to work. So, if you're still out there, I just want to tell you that I loved you, so, so much!\", I could start hearing her sob when she finished her speech.\n\nI couldn't feel any of my limbs anymore, but, even so, I used all of the strength I had left to say,\"I love you too.\", and my torso started disappearing. I could hear Death in the background.\n\n\"You know, after seeing the face of many souls going to the afterlife, I've got to admit, yours is one that appears the most peaceful.\"\n\nI briefly laugh at his statement, before the last traces of my soul got swiped away.",

            "comment": "Sitting here watching these two brother argue reminds me of my past.\n\nI slip into a memory of a time before anything was written or there was a language besides basic grunting and pointing. To this day I can not believe my brother was Abel to do it. I close my eyes and the memories come flooding in.\n\nI had just showed him that I could sharpen this strange rock and make it sharp to hunt the animals around us. We were excited, we could feed our family. We could show Adam that we could be useful after he and mom had gotten us cast out of the garden. Then it happened I knocked a rock loose from the wall next to us and it landed on his foot.\n\nTo no surprise he was upset, but this time it was different he had the sharp object. He stabbed me. Not just once but multiple times. I  closed my eyes when he did. I only opened them when the pain had stopped, and when I did I stood over my dead body as my brother wept, shaking my lifeless body. His face full of regret.\n\n Now I know what the stories say it's that I killed my brother, and the big man condemned me to wander eternally. This in a way was true as I am to walk this Earth forever, but not hopelessly roaming. I am guiding those who have died that way they will never have to experience the loneliness that I had in the earliest days. \n\nAs the memory fades I focus on these two brothers fighting still. I can feel the anger rising in the room. There is hatred between the two, and not just some sort of sibling rivalry. I started becoming more aware of the situation and hearing one shout \"I hate you Remus you always try to foil my plans of the city!\" Remus respoded by picking up the stone tablet next to them that had the order for the next stone shipment and smashing over Romulus' head. Romulus was dead before he even hit the ground. \n\nAs per usual the new soul turned directly at me. \"Am I dead?\" Romulus asked. I just pointed to his lifeless body as Remus continued to take out his anger on his dead brother body. Romulus shook in terror as he watched his brother beat his corpse. \"It is time Romulus let us go to the land of Nod\" I spoke calmly.",

            "comment": "\"Welcome,\" said Mr. Bean. To the people he'd met in the last few years, the cold, cutting clarity of his voice would have been foreign, perhaps even unsettling. To the other four Horsemen, who knew Mr. Bean only as the insidious Disaster, it was almost reassuring.\n\n\"You're early,\" observed War, tossing a smartphone in her left hand like it was a live hand grenade: absolutely harmless, to *her*.\n\n\"Aren't I always?\" drawled Mr. Bean. He looked at Pestilence. \"You're looking well, P.\"\n\nPestilence waved the compliment away with a pale, pox-riddled hand. \"I didn't think I'd make it here, to be honest. We'll have to thank Mr. Wakefield in person.\"\n\n\"And Famine,\" Mr. Bean continued, grandly spreading his arms in a very un-Bean-like gesture. The skeletal, gangling Famine gave him an awkward bow, never once taking his eyes off him.\n\n\"And me,\" finished Death. Her face, as always, was invisible under the dark pool of shadow cast by her cowl. Between her cloak and the scythe she held, she alone looked the part of a Horseman, ready to ride headlong into the blood-soaked dusk.\n\nWar looked straight at Mr. Bean and nodded appreciatively. \"You've been busy, Disaster.\" Indeed, the fruits of his latest efforts lay strewn all over the view of the city outside his apartment window. They could only assume that the rest of the city looked the same.\n\n\"I count fifteen dead,\" Death said. \"Three impalements, one beheading, six cases of lethal internal bleeding, two crushed skulls, and three drowned.\" The five of them paused thoughtfully. In the background, the faint sound of sirens could be heard.\n\n\"Those aren't very big numbers for a hurricane,\" War pointed out.\n\n\"It wasn't a hurricane,\" said Mr. Bean.\n\nWar frowned. \"A flood, then? But those numbers are even worse--\"\n\nMr. Bean shook his head. \"It wasn't a flood.\"\n\n\"Then what caused this mayhem?\" wheezed Pestilence.\n\nFor a moment, Mr. Bean was silent. His eyes grew distant, and his shoulders slumped. \"Well,\" he said, sounding as if he were on the brink of the very *human* despair of being confronted by his own inadequacies as a person. \"I was trying to buy this sandwich.\"\n\nEDIT: Ah damn, missed the part where it said his name was Ignorance. Oh well.",

            "comment": "On a pale horse, Death galloped into the world, his cloak burning behind him like black fire, and his scythe gleaming with the sharpness of inevitable demise. The last of the five to enter the mortal realm.\n\n\"I've come to harvest the souls of this world.\" Death's hollow eyes wandered over his siblings. \"I trust you've all taken great strides to pave my way?\"\n\n\"A global conflict is knocking on the door,\" War said, lifting her helmet and shaking out her fiery locks. \"Through the apocalypse, I will ride by your side, brother. Just give me a little more time... it will happen!\"\n\nDeath nodded. \"I was hoping for more... Actual battles, men at each other's throat! Swords and blood! Smoke and fires! At this rate, maybe there won't be an apocalypse...\" \n\nWar hung her head. \"I've really tried! But these blasted nuclear weapons just sit there... creating this... this... abomination called a 'cold war.'\" \n\nShe spat on the ground for emphasis. Death sighed, shifting his unblinking gaze over to his younger brother. \n\n\"You've also been struggling, I can tell,\" he said, his hollow voice ripping across the dusty plains of Armageddon. \n\n\"Everyone keeps stuffing their face with sugar and fat! How am I supposed to starve a world where everyone's overweight!\" Famine cried in frustration. \"Seriously, these mortals aren't even trying anymore. There's always that extra bag of chips picked up at the store, and that infernal fast food business. Seriously, those pizza delivery guys outrun my horse.\"\n\nDeath's face darkened under the cloak. He turned to the fourth horseman. \"Well, what about you then?\"\n\n\"I just have one word for you. Antibiotics,\" Pestilence said, flies buzzing around him. \"What am I supposed to do? I can spread diseases all day, but nobody freaking dies from them anymore! They have a cure for everything these days. I'm starting to feel impotent... kind of like War for the last five decades. Anyway, just give me some more time, I'm working on resistant bacteria...\"\n\nWar glared at him but said nothing. Death tightened his skeletal knuckles around the grip of the scythe. He'd hoped for an easy harvest. A quick reaping of the world.\n\nReluctantly, he turned to his youngest brother. \"What have you been up to?\"\n\nEyes-wide, Ignorance looked up. His big brown eyes nervously flicked across the others. His mouth hung slightly open. He cleared his throat, fixed his tie, and ran a comb through his hair. \n\n\"Well?\" Death said, impatiently snapping his bony fingers.\n\nHe wasn't expecting anything. His youngest brother had always been unreliable, at best. \n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\" Death said when he noticed that the short chubby man wasn't paying attention.\n\nIgnorance looked up again, and this time pointed at himself, looking like a big question mark. \n\n\"Yes, you. What have you been up to... *brother*?\" Death said.\n\nIgnorance swallowed and pointed at his phone. \n\n\"You've been on your phone?\" Death clenched his jaw. Not much of a surprise there.\n\nThe man nodded nervously.\n\n\"Give me that,\" Death said, and snatched the phone out of his hands. \n\nHe was just about to toss it into the desert when he noticed something on the screen. \"Who are all these people?\" Death tapped on the phone. \"Followers? You have a cult?\"\n\nIgnorance nodded. \n\n\"Interesting...\" Death mumbled. \"Facebook... Twitter... Instagram... and all you do is post memes and cat pictures?\"\n\nIgnorance looked at his feet. \n\n\"Wait, there's more,\" Death rumbled. \"Huh... you've been sharing highly dubious articles... anti-vaccine... homeopathy... conspiracy theories... wait, how did they get this many Likes?\"\n\nIgnorance shrugged.\n\n\"Okay, listen up!\" Death said, turning to the others. \"I'll give you some more time to get your act together and prepare the world for my arrival. We'll postpone the apocalypse for now.\"\n\nThey all looked up in surprise and relief when Death turned his horse around.\n\n\"We'll discuss the logistics in greater detail,\" Death said and pulled out his own phone, following his little brother on social media. \"Until my return... Ignorance is in charge!\"\n\n***\nIf you liked this, you can find more of my stories over at r/Lilwa_Dexel",

            "comment": "It was just another day in England, and could be described succinctly with one word. Moist. The rain was at that stage of its life where it wasn't willing to commit hard enough for anything meaningful, but just felt like being around the area and occasionally clinging to you as you walk down the street to the local fish 'n chips. Now, that's not to say that the weather was as dreary and annoying everywhere in England, even though it unfortunately was. There was only one road in Highbury where the weather was different. Okay, maybe different isn't the best descriptor. It was like the Apocalypse. The Gates of Hades had opened at each end of the road. From these gates poured the souls of the damned and righteous alike, swirling through the houses of the London suburb with the kind of shrieks that put people in mental hospitals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom each portal stepped two massive horses, and on each horse sat a body cloaked in steel and darkness; and despair. The first on the left raised his hand. \"War, good to see that you and Death could make it. We know how busy the humans keep you\". \n\n\"Pestilence, Famine, my ~~brothers~~  gender-neutral siblings\" shouted War over the siren song of the dead, \"I hear the old meatsacks have been keeping you on your toes as well, what with all this not vaccinating and not feeding the hungry.\" Pestilence nodded at him. They closed in on each other, ending at the door marked No. 12, of Arbor Road. Death lifted his hand, rapping the firm and shiny knuckle-bones against the inconspicuous door. The door was quite lucky that it was dead, or else it would have ended up like the family of beetles living inside it. Dead. The door creaked open ominously, much like a lid of a coffin opening, and from that coffin walked the fifth horseman of the apocalypse. Bean. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Ignorance!\" Shouted Famine, pushing through the others to wrap Bean in its skinny arms. Bean pushed at Famine, moving the armour plated figure surprisingly far. A decidedly long session of grunting and charades followed, that is until the sound of War's hand making contact with his own face silenced the street. Even the ghoulish souls were scared of what was to come. \n\n\"Ignorance has taken his job so seriously,\" he whispered into his hands, \"that he has forgotten us and himself in the process.\" A mortal would never claim to have the authority, nay, the gall, to suggest that these immortal Harbingers of the Apocalypse did not handle this particular piece of information very well. In fact they were able to keep a calm head about this until Bean walked back out of the house with a flask and five cups. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n`The following has been redacted by order of Her Majesty's Government`\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Five Horsemen set out to Stonehenge. Bean had been magnanimously strapped to War by the party, and was now travelling with them despite his nasal cacophony of anguish and confusion. Thunder that rattled the world followed their journey. Explosions in a multitude of colours mixed into the rain, which had really come into itself in the last half hour and was truly coming down like cats and dogs, with the occasional small mammal mixed in for good literal measure. Hoof prints of fire led to the ancient stone circle of doom, placed there by the Gods like a restart button on a PC. Not enough to switch the project off for good, just enough to wipe the memory and start fresh. They took up their positions in the pentagram, and looked bloody marvelous doing it. They were covered in fire and starlight, and one was wearing a lovely tweed. Each raised a sword, swinging it down in front of themselves to split the Earth in five. Well, four were trying to split the Earth. One was trying to split the other four. Pestilence was unfortunate enough to be closest. His body was bisected rather easily, the rotting armour and flesh falling to the floor in piles. Bean swung the other way, cleaving a rather unsightly dent into Famine. Bean grunted heroically at this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWar and Death looked at each other. No one knows what words were spoken between their eyes, or what tone the flick of an eyebrow could convey, but it probably went something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Death: What in the name of God is going on here?*\n\n*War: Ignorance has lost it. Well to be honest he probably didn't have it in the first place.*\n\n*Death: We've lost two and Ignorance is trying to kill us, surely we can't still finish calling the Apocalypse.*\n\n*War: Okay let's call it off, hire some interns, and come back as the Four Horsemen. We just won't fetch this idiot next time.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs their eyes met, they vanished, and Bean was left alone, in the moonlight, at Stonehenge, with a sword, in a tweed coat. And nothing else.",

With the thunderous voices radiating divine glory the lamb rose, a man among men. Except there was a problem. \n\nHe was a few years to early.\n\nThe man proclaimed himself Mr. Bean in an effort to remain clandestine. He could just summon the other four, but they were a bit of sticklers for tradition, and he didn\u2019t want to mess around with the man upstairs. Waiting was fine, he supposed. \n\nWhat to do with his spare time? How much spare time did he really have? He could have sworn the memo said November 5th, 1990.   He needed to do an accounting of the numbers\u2014a full account\u2014with all the scriptures at hand. \n\n\u201cCan I help you sir?\u201d The Jeweler said, staring at the strange man in front of him. \n\nMr. Bean hunched over, staring at the timepieces. \n\n\u201cSir? Can I help you?\u201d  \n\nMr. Bean looked up, adjusting his red tie. \u201cMmmm, yes.\u201d \n\n\u201cIs there something I can take out for you?\u201d\n\nMr. Bean pointed towards a calculator watch. \u201cBingo!\u201d\n\nThe accounting was done; he arrived thirty year too early. So he spent the next thirty years looking at pigeons, spreading butter all over his sandwiches, and trying his dandiest to fit in with the rest of the world. This was a bit difficult at times. Eventually, with the crack of thunder and another sounding of angels, the others arrived on horseback, bathed in power and majesty.\n\n\u201cGoodness me. Has it been thirty years already?\u201d Mr. Bean said. \n\nDeath and Famine shot nervous glances at eachother. War giggled. It had been the best thirty years of their existence. Pestilence finally spoke up. \u201cUm\u2026 yeah. Yes it has been thirty years, funny thing that mix-up. Can you open the scrolls now?\n\nMr. Bean wrung his hands in delight and drew a katana from his belt. \u201cOh!\u201d \n\nWar sighed, and his disappointment caused the nearest tavern to break out into an unruly mob. \u201cOk, well, anyway, here we go.\u201d\n\nHe drew a scroll from his white robe and presented it to the all-powerful Mr. Bean, who clutched it with glee. He made a strange noise with his tongue, waving the scroll overhead like he was trying to flag down a taxi. Then, to the utter astonishment of the other four, he took the katana and sliced the scroll in two.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d Death said. \n\n\u201cDoes anyone know how to fix this? Can we just\u2026 get the big G to make another scroll?\u201d Pestilence added, surrounded by thousands of flies. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d Mr. Bean said. \n\nHe grabbed a big package of duct tape and began to hastily tape the scroll back together. In a matter of minutes, his masterpiece was complete. He managed to tape his eyebrows together, his left hand was taped to his right knee, and the scroll was now cut into four irregular shaped pieces.\n\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d War said, and used his red sword to cut Mr. bean free. \n\nMr. Bean started crawling on the ground. He wanted to be a pretty caterpillar, and he was going to do just that. \n\n\u201cCan we just end the world without him?\u201d Famine suggested.\n\nUpon hearing this, Mr. Bean had a moment of clarity. \u201cCome and see!\u201d\n\nIn a second, the five were transported to Disneyworld. Mr. Bean immediately ran towards Mickey and embraced him. People around screamed and ran from the startling appearance of the other four, leaving Aloha Isle unoccupied. \n\nFamine sighed. \u201cWell, at least we have Dole Whip.\u201d\n\n***\nr/BLT_WITH_RANCH",

            "comment": "You thought they were horsemen. Some brave soul in a past age, one that is now dying, had the wisdom, foresight, and depth of perception to uncover higher truths about the world, and the mystery of life. \n\nChrist, the man, and his disciples were men of high spiritual discipline, they were the great seeds who\u2019s truthful words begot an entire era of their reign. One of the many gifts they experienced as a result of their high level of consciousness, was that of foresight. In the mysterious and veiled book of revelations, Christ and his disciples give account of visionary experiences, during which they channeled often poetic and dramatic images of true events that would come to pass in the future of the planet. \n\nIn one of the most well known of these visions, the end of days is described. This is not meant to be understood as the actual complete end of days, it is meant to mark a time of great transformation of the human species upon the planet earth. The book of revelation discusses four harbingers of this end of days. \n\n**Death**\nThe bringer of death to many, this can be interpreted as both a literal plague of death, or as the death of an old age, giving way to something greater.\n\n**war**\nHe who commands war commands al the nations of the world. A duplicitous character, he can represent war and division among men, or the war between what has passed in the age, and what will be in the next. \n\n**Famine**\nAs world population rises, a greater number of individuals find themselves in poverty. There is also a deep hunger in the race to advance, a feeling that something is missing.\n\n**Conquest**\nThe character of conquest rides on a divided world, and unifies it underneath the global flag.  Conquest, it is little known, is actually the savior in this story. \n\n\nLike any good hero, conquest would, in the time of the end, set out to defeat the other horsemen, bringing peace and light to a new age of humanity, one freed from the sins of the past. \n\nBut that was a misunderstood, metaphorical story in revelation...\n\nA two thousand year old book looking foreword to the end of the era it was just beginning. We now have a much more finite view of that end, and what may have been meant in that vision. We live in a world of people. Political and social figures become media sensations, and are able to significantly alter the course of life on the planet. It is possible to now understand that the horsemen foreseen as prophets of the end times, were in fact real, they were actual people, who would appear on the earth and make such a mess of things that there would be no choice but for the citizens of the world to remake the world in an entirely new way. \n\nFour horsemen. We now know, were truly five. One, conquest, is meant to lead the shift in consciousness, but another stepped up to fill the fourth mantle, only, he wouldn\u2019t ride a horse, he couldn\u2019t even drive a car! But we will get to him in a moment, as he is a part of the newer knowledge that we have gained as we approach this end of days, foreseen so many years ago. \n\nIf we wish to identify the individuals in today\u2019s world who actually are these four horsemen, we only need to trace the things they are said to cause back to the human individual who is the largest source of that thing in the world.\n\nFor famine, we can search the entire world, we see that famine exists in all nations, but mostly in those of the Middle East, and Africa. We can trace the causes of famine back several decades. World War Two was a precursor to many of the modern worlds problems. The alliances and invasions that were undertaken as a result of this war caused a dramatic shift in the balance of wealth and resources in the worlds poorest nations. Take this, coupled with his death camps, where millions were literally starved to death, and. We can point to none other than Adolf Hitler as one of the horsemen today the apocalypse. The earliest on the scene and the first to depart it, he served as a catalyst for the rest. The others would arrive together, and we are just now witnessing their power.\n\nThe trained spy, assassin, and man who regularly has anyone in his way murdered, the veritable tzar of modern Russia is death.  Vladimir Putin is the modern death, cold, calculated, and without just cause. Death pulls all the strings towards himself, and is the mastermind leading the end of days. Without death, rebirth cannot arise. He is nearly impossible to outwit, and seems to control many of the worlds forces. Including war.\n\nWar is scarlet red, or maybe bright orange. Either way he looks as though his head were on fire, like a shock of yellow flame for hair. War causes division among men, among men and women, among people who are meant to be neighbors and coworkers. War coerces many to believe their cause is just, when it seems that there can be no cause in *truth* To go to war. War lies. War is a lie. Donald Trump, our hot-headed president of the United States has divided a nation, and the world. In a way that has not been done before. This division seems as though it has fractured the very foundation of the modern world, and political system.\n\nThe world stage is set, those evil forces which make up two thirds of our story, the rise of famine, and the subsequent and simultaneous rise of death and of war, have set the stage for the final act, the great battle when good, conquest, comes in the form of a person, who has not yet been discovered, and may not appear for some time still, to overpower the forces set into motion by these figures, and bring about a peaceful world. \n\nThere has been one piece of information that was never discussed, for it was not understood, even in metaphor, there is a passage of the book of revelation that has rarely seen print, although it appears in some very important ancient manuscripts on the book. Bible scholars reference him as the \u2018horseless horseman\u2019 because he is said to ride an invisible horse. I\u2019m the ancient Aramaic, the language of the Bible, there exists a word which directly translates to \u2018silliness\u2019 it is thought to have had several meanings, but in any other example of it, this is the only meaning that can be taken seriously.\n\n It is thought that this silly horseless horseman would be a figure of a different plague, he is thought to imbue ignorance in those who take pleasure in his antics, he will dance through life, leaving meaningless distraction in his wake, meaning that he will destroy the minds of men, as well as physical destruction. There has only been one figure in modern history who has exemplified this trait to its highest degree. Mr bean came along at the beginning of the middle section of this earthly story. Acting as a beacon of silliness, his form of slapstick and destruction based humor would inspire the comedy of a generation. He would stumble through life, bringing a love of ignorance to the world through silliness. Not riding a horse of an institution like the others, but walking among the people. He began this stage, and his work is done. He fit into the plan, and has set the stage for this final event. \n\nWhen conquest arrives, a great battle will occur, until then, perhaps we can just sit back, and enjoy watching a grown man ridiculously wandering the streets and leaving destruction in his wake.",

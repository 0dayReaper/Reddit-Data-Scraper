            "comment": "I remember before I met friend. I don't like to remember, but I can. I remember the dark and cold. I remember mama wouldn't wake up. It was raining. Big men came and put me in a box, then put that box in a bigger mover box. I remember bumping up and down and the men talking loudly, and the rain hitting the bigger mover box, and loud angry geese sounds. When the big box opened they carried me in my little box inside. I was shaking and barking and shrieking and scared I was scared. They emptied my box into a bigger box and left me there for days. I got food and water, but people poked and pricked at me. I was scared and no one could help and I was lonely and I missed mama and I didn't think I was going to get out. The other dogs were bigger and louder and barked at me through the box walls. \n\nThat's when I met friend. He came in and stopped and looked at me. I didn't want him to grab me like the other men did, but he lifted me gently. It reminded me of mama. I liked him and I wanted him to stay, but then he walked away and I barked, and I barked, and I barked, but he didn't hear me. But then he came back. He put me in a big mover box again, but I wasn't in the smaller box so it wasn't as bad. \n\nThen when we got to his inside place it was the biggest box I had ever seen. I ran all around it, and I was tired by the time I had run around the whole thing. I could jump and run, and friend was always there to play, or sit on, or protect. He went away a lot when the sun was out, but he was always home after it went down. Some days he was with me the whole day. \n\nI was scared of the outside when he first found me, but he made me love it again. The walks, and the toys, oh the toys, there were so many toys, and bones, and treats, and belly scratches. He let me run free and was always there to go back to. I remember those days. They were my favorite. \n\nHe even helped me get over my fear of the big mover boxes. Usually, they went to the park. Sometimes, they went to the other place. The other place reminded me of where friend found me. It was all white and the floor went click click click under my paws. It had a big lady with glasses and a white coat. She would poke and prod at me, but friend was always there so I wasn't that scared.\n\nBut all of that seems so long ago. My legs are tired now. The outside seems so much bigger than it did. I can only run for so long now. But friend still brings me. He brings my toys too, they still cheer me up. They don't squeak as much, but I don't mind. The outside is starting to hurt. The cold gets through my fur easier. I feel so sorry to friend. I know he wishes we could still run and play. I try to, for a time, but I don't think I can keep up with him anymore. I wish I could thank him for everything. For getting me out of that box. He made me the luckiest dog in the whole world. He gave me things I didn't think I would ever have. I never felt so lost when my mama went to sleep. I thought no one would ever make sure I was ok. No one would ever be there to protect me. Then friend did. I was never able to thank him enough, but I hope he knows.\n\nFriend says were going for a ride soon. He's been taking me to the park more, so that's probably where we're going. I remember once, when I was tiny, we went to the other place and the woman poked me with a needle. It made me sleep for at least a hundred years. I feel like that now; like I could sleep for one hundred years. Maybe Friend can bring me back there. So she can give me another poke. I'll be less tired after another hundred years.   \n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the kind words. I only hope that this thread was able to ease OPs pain, even if just for a little while. To all those crying, it's alright, I cried too. Dogs are too pure for this world. For everyone giving me gold, thank you, really. But please, donate to an animal shelter instead. Every little bit helps.",

            "comment": "In the day, the cars zoom by, engines roaring, tires screeching. They'd kill you without a second thought. I've seen it happen. The sun beats down, warming your being into a sense of pleasant sleepiness, but this, too, can be dangerous. On some days, when you rest, you may wake up to a crowd of teenagers, cheering and throwing stones. On others, you may not wake at all, torn between extreme thirst and no strength left to quench it. My best friend and most loyal pack mate stopped to rest in a parking lot and woke up with his fur burnt off, skin melted into the hot tar. I barked for help, but none came. So now I sleep in the shade. \n\nAs dangerous as the day was, I preferred it. I learned to avoid most of the dangers, and made use of the daylight to find food in the trash cans. But at night, the ghouls come out. They walk, staggering from left to right, and drive differently. Worse. Sometimes, they carry bottles. Sometimes, they throw them. Sometimes they chase me, but slowly and clumsily. The ghouls come out, and they steal from the good men. They burn foul odors into the air and suck it into their chest. In the day, I can sometimes beg food from the good men. At night, I only run from the ghouls. \n\nMost of the time I avoid them, but I've actually encountered them once. It had been a warm day, and I'd salvaged bits of crust from a pizza box in an alleyway. I curled up on the box to nap, and when I woke, it was dark. And a ghoul stood before me. \n\nHe was a shorter, older one who smelled of burger grease and cigarettes. He wore a mask over his head that hid his ears. A gun was tucked into the seat of his pants. He pointed it at a passerby and shouted something. They stopped. \n\nI felt a growl rising from deep within me. I did not like this ghoul. He turned towards me as I got up from my napping spot and jumped him. His eyes widened as my teeth fastened around his ankles, and a cracking noise, so loud it hurt my ears, came from the metal tube. My back hurt. \n\nThe ghoul kicked me off and moved up to kick me again, but something flung him back. That was the last thing I saw before I fell back asleep. My back no longer hurt. It just felt wet. \n\nI woke up on a stone floor with sticky cloth on my back. Someone had fastened a plastic cone around my head and placed bowls of food and water in the corner. I ate. It was good. But I was stuck.\n\nIt was a small room that served as my prison. It was always daytime, but never warm. I could smell other dogs nearby, and hear a few farther out, but all I had was a rug to sleep on and no room to run. Sometimes, men would walk by and look at me. Sometimes, ghouls would do the same. Once in a while, a man would come and take me out to explore. If I behaved, he'd give me extra food. \n\nA long time passed, and the fur grew back on my back. The man came in again and took me outside. He gave my leash to someone I'd never seen before. I smelled him. He smelled okay. He scratched me behind the ears and talked. Then he took me to his car. \n\nThat night, I slept in the dark in a new place. I had a bed, a few toys, a throw pillow I took from the couch, and a sock I found behind it. They were better to chew than the toys. In the morning, the man came back and we went to the park. I had a family. I was home. \n\n[subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tensingstories/)",

He was biting at the water, front paws bouncing as the little one giggled and moved the stream across his face. Left. Then right. Then left. Up! Down! In *circles!*. He coughed and sneezed as he tried to catch every drop.\n\nA bigger one had come out shouting at him, so sensing that playtime was over he woofed his appreciation to the little one and bounced on down the road.\n\nAfter a few passing pats as he plodded down the road, he realised he was still thirsty. Classic. Always forgetting that hoses were for drinking, as well as playing. He'd have to find some less mobile water somewhere, and maybe some sausage - he couldn't quite remember where he'd had sausage before, or what it tasted like, all he knew was that when he heard 'sausage!' - boy, would he get excited!\n\nTuning back into his surroundings, he found himself off the street. There were some fences on either side of him, some less grey than others, but only one he was interested in; with a gate banging gently against the latch, unlocked. Over the fence was smoke, gently blowing with the wind toward him, and carried with it were some *wonderful* smells! He was a simple boy, and an honest boy - but that doesn't mean he couldn't be a smart boy - especially when it comes to smells. Walking up to the banging latch, he juts his nose at the gap, bumping it against the wood. Ouch. He sneezed off the boop and lined himself up again, sliding his nose inbetween the banging wood and sharply flinging it to the right. The gate swung open, his nose hitting the ground twitching as it traced the smell.\n\nA few feet ahead of him, a few big ones were gathered. Three were sitting, making happy noises, whilst another one stood up behind a metal thing. He flipped his arm up and down, and with each flip came a very loud sizzle sound and a hearty blast of very tasty smells.\n\nOne of the sitting ones was looking at him and slapping their knees, he plodded forward a little - hesitantly, checking just for triple sure that those *were* happy sounds they were making. It was hard to focus, with all these smells, but heck it was worth the risk! \n\nAs the one who'd beckoned him ran their hands over his head, a very relaxing kind of pat, a small bowl of water was placed down in front of him. He happily lapped up what he could, trying his best not to make a mess, and ignoring the hand sweeping over his neck as they looked for a collar. He accepted a few more pats (but respectfully declined a belly rub) before he sat up and plodded back over to gate, shoving it open with another determined boop. \n\nIt clanged behind him, and he stepped on further into the unknown, following wherever his nose would take him.\n\n",

            "comment": "*(Since today is Valentine's Day, we decided to put a small Valentine's spin on the story.)*\n\nSteve had only been my owner for a day, but I already loved him. He'd put me in a bright red collar, decorated it with a shiny pink bow, and gave me treats when I sat inside a giant paper box. It was a little strange, and when Steve closed the lid of the box, I was scared for a second thinking he was going to send me back to the kennel, but then Steve's fingers peeked in from a hole in the side with another treat, and I happily lapped it up.\n\nA moment later a door opened, and I barked, expecting an intruder. Or a squirrel. There was a high-pitched human shriek, and I barked even louder. What if Steve was in trouble? I had to help him! I leaped up in the box, knocking the lid to the floor, and peeked outside. There was a female human there, bundled up in hat and scarf, grinning and screaming at me. I wasn't sure what to make of it, so I barked at her, and she swooped in and wrapped her arms around my body.\n\nSteve and the female honked at each other with their mouths, then pressed their mouths together. They must really feel safe around each other to do that! The female helped me out of the box, gave me a treat, and I loved her too.\n\nOver the next days, Steve and his female (whose name I think was Laura, but was hard to tell from human honks) walked me around outside. I sniffed all of the trees, found a perfect one to pee on, and barked at all of the squirrels. It was amazing. At night Steve and Laura would sit on a very soft log (maybe it was made of squirrels?) in front of a glowing screen, and I'd sit on their laps as they'd pet me. It was amazing.\n\nBut sometimes Steve and Laura would honk at each other in a bad way. They would bare their teeth and growl and I didn't like it. I'd crawl back into the giant paper box I'd come out of, and wait for it to end. When it did, and they found me, they'd come over and honk happily at me, though not as happily as they used to.\n\nWe went on walks less and less. Steve spent more time in his room alone. Laura spent more time on the soft-log alone, looking at a flat bone in her hands that rang and honked a lot. Something was wrong. Steve and Laura liked each other as much as I liked that hamburger that squeaked when I chewed on it. I needed to help them.\n\nI went over to my paper box in the closet and clasped the bright pink ribbon in my teeth. I trotted upstairs to Steve's room and clawed on the door and whimpered until he opened it. He honked angrily at me, but I dashed away downstairs, and he followed. I went over to Laura on the soft-log, set the bow down next to her, and then turned to Steve, panting happily.\n\nSteve gazed at the bow next to Laura. She looked up from the flat-bone her hands. They smiled at each other, and I thought that Steve was going to sit next to her and I could lay across their laps like we used to. But instead Steve bent down, rubbed my head, and walked away.\n\nThe next day we went for a car ride. I was so excited! Maybe we were going to the park. But then a familiar, pungent smell hit me. The kennel. The car pulled up right in front of it and we stopped.\n\nI immediately started barking, fighting against Steve and Laura as they pulled me out of the car. Laura was crying and Steve was honking loudly and angrily. He was stronger than me. I couldn't escape. They brought me inside, and the familiar, scary smell paralyzed me. Steve and Laura honked at some woman dressed in white, she honked back, and then after a final pat on the head, they left.\n\nWhat had I done wrong? I tried so hard to make them happy. Why would they bring me back here? I loved them. Didn't they love me?\n\nThe woman in white pulled my leash, leading me back to the hallways of barking dogs that I remembered too well. I scraped my paws against the ground, whimpering in protest. The woman just honked frustrated at me and pulled harder.\n\nBut then a man came over. He honked at the woman, and she stopped pulling me. He bent down and rubbed my head. I didn't know what to think. I licked his hand and he honked at the woman some more, until finally he took my leash and we walked out of the kennel together. I followed him, nervous, and he led me to a car. He opened the back door and ushered me in, but I didn't know what to do. What if he brought me back to the kennel again, just like Steve and Laura?\n\nThe man honked at me and then did something that Steve and Laura never did: he opened the car passenger door and pointed. He wanted me to sit up front with him?\n\nExcited, I bounded in and started panting in the passenger seat. The man climbed inside and started the car. He honked at me some more, and between his strange mouth sounds, I think I figured out his name: oppositewerewolf. He gave me a treat. I already love him.\n\n*****\nThis prompt was written with the help of chat at the [ScottWritesStuff](https://www.twitch.tv/scottwritesstuff/) Twitch stream.",

            "comment": "\"Barks, Scruff, Danny\" Nips said hello, sniffed butts and settled on the grass. The Williams kid would be starting his paper route soon. They'd chase him for a block or two, make him pedal off some of that winter weight, then they'd come back to stretch and let their bellies warm in the sun. \n\n\"Hey Nips\" Barks asked \"where'd you get that scar?\"\n\n\"Oh this?\" Nips flopped his ear back, showing the long gash to everyone. \"Well Barks, I got this one before you were even born\".\n\nDanny looked down and scratched his ear.\n\n\"See\" Nips began \"this came from a time me and Danny was out on the town down near the tracks back in '11.\" Nips licked his lips. The gang was rapt.\n\n\"It was December, close to Christmas. That time of year when kids are running everywhere, all jacked up on the hope of new toys and a puppy under the tree. Danny told me about a couple of ladies that he'd seen from the truck window so we decided to take a walk. You know how the days get dark early then, so we set out early. We made it down to the tracks pretty quick, it was cold so you had to keep moving. I could smell the marks of a hundred dogs so I didn't hold out much hope for the ladies still be, shall I say, available? \n\nAnyway we looked around a bit, chased a cat or two, and were just about to head home when this kid runs out in the middle of the street crying. He's got this pup in his arms, the pup is trying to lick his face, you know, cheer him up, but the kid ain't stoppin. \n\nSo Danny goes over, flops down and tries to get the kid to rub his belly. Now, boys, I seen a lot of roll overs in my day and Danny's are among the best. But that kid didn't see Danny for nothin. \n\nAnd then I see why. \n\nOut of the door burst this big guy, maybe five dogs high. And he's red. Not just his face. His hands, his chest and if I coulda saw his feet I'da bet they was red too. He starts yelling about that cute little puppy who, as near as I could tell, had eaten the big guys steak. And the big guy says there's going to be hell to pay. \n\nAnd the big guy knocks the kid and grabs that puppy and draws his arm back like he's going to send that cute little thing to the moon.\n\nWell, Danny wasn't having any of that and neither was I. So Danny goes for the guys pant leg to trip him up a bit. And if Danny had been a little quicker he would have seen the guys other leg swinging round to clock him in the ribs..sent Danny halfway cross the road. \n\nWhich only made me madder. So I leaped. I'd like to think it well reasoned but that leap was pure emotion. I landed squarely in his chest and sunk my teeth into the very arm that held that wee dog. Not enough to break the skin, but enough to make him let go. What I didn't count on was once he let go of the pup he had two hands for me. He grabbed me and tossed me right into a street sign. Cut me pretty bad but not very deep. Looked worse than it was.\"\n\n\"What about the pup? Was the pup ok?\" Scruffs asked with a tear in his eye. \n\n\"The pup? Ya, sure. Danny and me checked up on him over the years. Turned into a great big Shepard. Looked like the big guy went away and the kid seemed ok too. They had that bond, eh boys? Nothin like it\"\n\n\"Nothing like it\" they all agreed. They'd all had it once, when they had boys of their own. \n\nAnd then the Williams kid rode by and they were young again. ",

            "comment": "The Long Happy began almost as soon as I was born. I remember before it started. They were yelling. They would yell and throw things and ma would lick my fur until the shaking stopped. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\nShe would put her big paws over my tiny body and protect. I was safe in the warm and dark, tucked right up against her belly until I drifted to sleep. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\nOne day, she was gone. There was a truck, some soft and kind voices...some food, food, and man it smelled so good, i just wanted to chase, I ran and ran and chased the truck but it was so fast and they were gone. \nAlone was wrong. It didn't feel like it was mine. I survived.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nNo kind paws, no licks, no warm belly. It was raining, there was cold and wet. I hate cold and wet. Unless i'm digging it into the ground...but this was the relentless kind, it was like a river but the wrong way up, and i was cold, cold, cold. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\nI grew. I met so many friends, but none of them looked like me. Some got close. Some of them sniffed. Some of them hissed and scratched me, ow. I paddled in streams and played with birds. I saw others like me. Sometimes they followed me. I could be scary. I learned to protect. I scared other scary things away from smaller things. I protected tiny humans, and baby floofs, and even the little scratchy hissing things.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nIt felt like I ran all over the world. I'd dug up every patch of dirt there was to dig. I'd howled at the moon and swam in puddles and oceans. But I was cold. I was alone. I got sick. And then I could not protect...not even me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nAnd then there was...warm? Nice warm paw - soft skin, soft voice.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nIt held me close to a warm belly and I licked and yipped and wriggled and then there was a big face full of love and all of a sudden I knew I belonged. And so did they. And the Long Happy began. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\nIt was pack. Food. Running. Chasing. Licking. I discovered new things that I loved every single day. I loved the ear scritch, then the belly rub, then that spot on my bum near my tail....the chicken, the pork, the smell of my pack (even better than food). Even when I was alone, I knew I would not always be.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nI ran, chased, escaped, caught balls, panting and looking around for the next game. It's hard work!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nTiring work.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nI'm great at all those things. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\nWhen you win the game every time you can get tired. And after a while, your legs ache a little. It's harder to see. You can't quite run so far. And maybe there are less balls. There are definitely less balls. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\nI wondered if the Long Happy could end, once. I was afraid. And sore. Would I be cold again? Would there be alone?\n&amp;nbsp;\nI can't see my pack well anymore, but all of a sudden they are there. With their paws, and soft belly, and kisses, and I am so comfy and happy and warm. I sleep, and know that I am safe. I drift away and feel the Long Happy grow longer. I know that it will last forever. \n\n\n",

So back in the pick up and the long drive back.  lightening started as we were driving and the thunder started to remind me of the sound of war. 2Rex was feeling it too and began whinging from the back. I pulled over and opened his box as lightning cracked above. I reacted by driving for my fox hole and he drove beside me as we had done countless times before. I realized his time had come and mine too. \n\nWe stopped off at a diner on the way home and I let him let him out while I went inside. I came back out to find him playing with a little girl. He had his youth back and his puppy was coming out again. A lady came out and said oh she just loves dogs smiling at her daughter. I replied \"take care of them for me then\"  ",

            "comment": "I was the last of my kind, at the end of my time. This is my story. \n\nMy planet was doomed. The alien species know only as C.A.T. had completely wiped out our military defensive. As a last ditch effort to stop them from advancing through the galaxy, I blew up my home. I got into my craft and set the director to find the nearest habitable planet. At safe distance, I hit the detonator. I didn't calculate for aftershocks and got blown off course. Which turned out to be the best thing for me. \n\nOn this planet, a lot of what the indigenous species, humans, call \"dogs\" looked nearly identical to my kind. To the point where I would even try speaking to them, and they just kind of looked at me. They were not my people, much to my dismay, but I learned to blend in and be accepted. Eventually I learned their tongue, and felt more acceptance. I wouldn't find home for a while.\n\nI stumbled upon what the humans caked \"police academies\" and snuck myself in with the lot. Humans, even with their gear capacity for good, aren't the brightest, they never noticed I wasn't part of their group. It was fun for a while, stopping bank robberies, diffusing bombs, catching the bad guys. That was they life.\n\nI grew bored of it after while. Wanting to find a place where I could just live put the rest of my years in peace and comfort. So I just left one day. No shortage pf these \"German shepards\", so I doubt they noticed.\n\nThat's the day I met you.\n\n(Without more info, that's all I could write up. Also had to get back to work. Good luck. It sucks now, and you really never get over it, but It does get easier. My dogs have been gone for 2years, and I think about them all the time. ",

Ever go into blood rage, go for the jugular, just dig your teeth into his throat? What, you think I did? Come on, I ain\u2019t a psycho! I ate some rats what was tryin\u2019 to move in on my alley and I mighta knocked a few heads together to make a point, but I ain\u2019t never killed nobody. The hell do you take me for?\n\nSpecifics, huh? Whatever. I was scavenging in the park and a big-ass bird was harassin\u2019 me. Eventually got mad, took a swing. Little bastard jumped out of the way and flew for it, turned his stupid head around to laugh at me, and smacked into a passing bus. Little feathered fucks never bothered me again.\n\nHow\u2019d I find the house? Simple, kid. I was wandering, and I decided I\u2019d seen enough fights, enough hunger, enough stupid fuckin\u2019 birds. I decided my wandering days were over. So I went in to the nearest driveway and curled up on the porch. Sat there for... hell, musta been hours. Finally the human who lived there saw me and let me in. I ate well that night, first time in ages.\n\nI gotta say... Once I found the human, there was no way I was ever goin\u2019 back to my old life. I had a good house, good food, and a good friend. What else could an old dog wish for?\n\nI\u2019ll tell ya, kid. Some peace and quiet. Getouttahere, I got booze to drink.",

            "comment": "Human. I do not know how to tell you this, but I'll put it in terms you may understand.\n\n\nYou know how you humans say \"cats have nine lives\"? Well, dogs live forever. We come through different lives and bodies, like the cats. However, we are always dogs or wolves.\n\n\nI am here to give you a run down of my life.\n\n\nFirst, I would like to tell you a story, taught to all dogs as pups.\n\n\n\nIn the days after creation; when there was no day or night, only twilight: humans and wolves lived in coexistence, two children were born in one day. This isn't abnormal today, but in those days, not many people were alive, and thus not many being born.\n\n\nA wolf girl, and a human boy. \n\nThe girl, named Kula, and the boy named Dabo.\n\n\nThe wolf priestess took it as a sign from the human sun god Ts'eyahi , and the wolf  moon goddess Ch'erek'a, that they were bound to be together forever.\n\n\n\nKula and Dabo were raised together, their families had arranged them to be married when they were older. Such things were accepted in those early days.\n\n\nOne time, when they had gotten to be older; Kula and Dabo were playing together in the forest.\n\n\nYou see, in those days, many horrid things lived in the mists beyond the village. Things that defied logic, space and time.\n\n\nAs they played, one such thing preyed on them.\n\n\nKula saw it first. She knew what she had to do to protect her best friend. She leaped at the neck of the beast, and tore out it out.\n\n\nIn honor of that first act of bravery, wolves now kill their prey by going for the neck.\n\n\n\nYears later, when they had grown up, a human woman named \u0100hi,  contested for the affection of Dabo.\n\n\n\u0100hi pleaded and prayed and still she didn't get the affection of Dabo.\n\n\nAfter a while summer if rejection, \u0100hi was twisted, and depraved. She knew what she would have to do, if she wanted Dabo.\n\n\nOne day, she slipped hemlock into a cup of  water, and gave it to Kula, who was thirsty from being out in the hunting party.\n\n\nKula got sick, and Dabo tended to her every need while Kula was laid low.\n\n\nThis display made \u0100hi furious, and she found another way.\n\n\nShe was helping to build a stone hut, for a family member, when she caught sight of Kula and Dabo. \n\n\nShe knew then, how she would end her once and for all.\n\n\n\u0100hi told Kula that she needed to speak to her in private. The two went outside of the town, into the forest.\n\n\n\u0100hi took a masonry stone, and tried to smash Kula's  head in.\n\n\n\nHowever, after the first blow, a giant wolf appeared to fall from the sky.\n\n\n\"You will stand down from my children!\" Said a pearl white wolf, with a voice somewhere between a growl and a blood curdling scream.\n\n\nIt was the lunar wolf goddess.\n\n\n\n\u0100hi tried to run, but the giant wolf smacked \u0100hi  down with her paw.\n\n\nKula hid under the Ch'erek'a, and \u0100hi fell to the ground and began to sob.\n\n\n\" Me and Ts'eyahi did not give either of you the right to cause harm to each other! You have no power... No right to harm each other! Now, we will have to reconsider things.\"\n\n\n\nThe Ch'erek'a healed Kula's head, and went on.\n\n\n\"You are coming with me, while I speak with the human god.\"\n\n\n\nThe wolf goddess took \u0100hi to yewishawib\u0113temenigi\u0161itiwehin\u012bb\u0113ti,  the prison in Ch'erek'a's palace on the moon, where the angelic servants of Ch'erek'a, kept her as a prisoner. \n\n\nCh'erek'a's servants did this until Ch'erek'a and  Ts'eyahi came to a consensus on what the future would be.\n\n\nAfter many lifetimes of debate, they came to several conclusions about the future.\n\n\nIt was determined that humans and wolves were both flawed, and need to be separated.\n\n\nHumans would embody the day, knowledge, and wickedness.\n\n\nWolves would embody night, justice, wilderness, and temperance between peace and violence.\n\n\nIt was determined that all living things from there on out, would die.\n\n\n\nIt was determined that wolves and humans, and thus day and night, would  be separated for 90,000 years.\n\n\n Ts'eyahi sentenced \u0100hi to be devoured by Ch'erek'a. Ch'erek'a's stomach being the realm of umhlabawokubolakunyenexhala, or as you humans would know it, hell itself.\n\n\nIt was determined that Ch'erek'a would handle   afterlife justice, devouring any  who were cruel in life, and permitting the kind to dwell in ilizwelothandonoxolophakathikwazozonkeizinto , or as you humans would know it, paradise.\n\n\nTs'eyahi would be responsible for keeping life on Earth, by harnessing the sun and water.\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, a new race would be created, to bind man and wolf. A race of pure light, taking the knowledge of man, the justice of wolves, and the goodness that both races had been intended to have. That is what I am. That is dog.\n\n\n\n\nNow, that I have told you of our past, owner. Now it is time for my story. \n\n\n\nI was a servant of Ch'erek'a. I was created to do her will. One day, I was told that I was to go down to earth as a dog, to help bring in ixeshaelitshanelingunaphakadelokuphelela, or as you would say, the new and eternal age of perfection.\n\n\n\nOwner, after I am done here, I will return to Ch'erek'a's palace. Soon, man and wolf will no longer be separated, and things will be perfect. Ch'erek'a and Ts'eyahi will come down to stay on Earth, and you and I will be together forever.\n\n\nDogs will govern all things from that day on, and I will treat you, just as you treated me, as a loving companion who will live with me, as I rule, forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Towards the center of the Garden, he perked up, anticipation giving speed to his movements. Was that a toe bean he saw pushing out of its nest of warm blankets? Ah, it was today, and he'd almost forgotten the best good little boy was on his way, eager to go forth and meet Friends and Name Givers and get pets and play fetch and protect his people from the Squirrels. A few little yips and yelps, a wet nose to the ear, one overdue First Belly Rub, and the best good little boy trotted out of the Garden, tail wagging wildly, towards the Big Adventure.",

            "comment": "You wanna know about my life, huh? Well let's have a nice fireside chat and I'll tell you all about it. If you're looking for a heart warming tale about cuddles, rainbows and endless pats on the scruff of the neck, I encourage you to stop reading now. My story starts in a dark and dingy part of the city. Dad was a retired police dog who I'd never met; everything I knew about him came from stories from mom, and other dogs in the neighbourhood. His stints on the force hadn't gone unrecognised and while I was nothing special, it was refreshing to be related to a dog of such legacy.\n\nI was born and raised on the porch of an old Minnesotan. He'd sold off all of my brothers and sisters for a tuppence, save me. I was the runt of the litter, so I was left behind with mom and one hell of an inferiority complex. Whenever I'd go out to play with neighbourhood pups, I'd face a barrage of snide barks about my size. My puphood was marred with constant deprecations, the likes of which have stayed with me to this day. \"Nothing personal, kid. You're just too small!\"  I don't remember much of my first few months of life, just that I'd come home each day and cuddle up in the warm embrace of my mother and cry myself to sleep. \n\nI remember the face of my one true love, a golden retriever Sally, who lived a few blocks down. Her white-gold face remains etched in my memory to this day, the grace of her snout, the shapeliness of her paws. I'd save a few rashers of bacon from my breakfast each morning and carry them to her. The effort was worth it to see her beautiful face light up with happiness. Every day we'd walk the block together collecting pats and smiles from strangers, bar the occasional whack on the neck from disgruntled pedestrians who would never understand love or care. Sally was my everything, and our happiness stood unmarred. That was, until her humans moved away taking her shimmering face with them. I'm not going to dwell too much on this loss, as it pales in comparison to what was to come. \n\nOne evening I returned home, exhuasted from the day's doggy shennanigans. My best friend, Presley the beagle had discovered a secret path which led straight to a settlement of ducks. What fun sneaking up on those feathered bastards was! I was still spitting out feathers as I walked through the door of the old Minnesotan's home. Now, the first thing I should've noticed was the already open door and the frenzied cries of my mother coming from the back of the house. I thought nothing of it, and simply chalked it up to the man needing some fresh air, and my mother wanting to be let out. But this was a quantum distance away from the truth and it became clearer as I further pattered along the hallway. Furniture was smashed all over the floor, and a pungent smell of rotting flesh and blood attacked my nose. I ran to the source of the smell. Nothing could prepare me for the sight I was to see. The old Minessotan was face down on the floor, with his hands outstretched by his side and a pool of human blood gathering by his head. I cried out for Lassie knows how long. My mother's shrieks joined my own, and for three days and three nights we mourned. Hungry, cold and sad we slept on the porch. Mom had been left chained to the porch, so food gathering was left to me; I would walk the neighbourhood from end to end looking for scraps to bring home to my starving mother. This went on for a week, a constant cycle of hunger and frustration and wading through the trash in the hopes of maybe finding discarded scraps of beef or even, Lassie forbid, salad! Can you imagine? The desparation a dog like me would need to feel for *salad* to be considered a meal option! \n\nMy stint as a scavenger came to an end when finally, a curious old woman ventured into our home. Her screams of terror when she found my deceased owner will stay with me to this day. The rest was a blur. The too-loud and too-bright police cars. The cold hands of animal control. Being taken away from my mother. And the cage. Oh, rawhide bones, the cage. For what seemed like an eternity, I lived my life as a captive. Occasionally humans would come by and inspect me, only to walk by with a shake of the head and a leer. \"This one's ugly! I want a pretty dog!\" Cried one child. I peered at her over-plump and hairless face, incredulous. *She* was in no positon to be handing out judgments of that sort, I thought haughtily. I don't remember how long that cage was my home, but I do remember the happiest day of my life. The day I left it. The cold, rough hands of animal control were replaced with the warm and loving hands of my new humans. The snide insults were replaced with \"good boy!\" and \"you're the best dog!\" Smacks on the back were replaced with loving belly scratches, and the scraps of meat I had scavenged were replaced with the finest gourmet meals. \n\nI've been with my humans for a few years now, and life is good. I could never have wished for better carers, and I hope they know this. I think they do. My humans are sitting around me crying, stroking my hair. If I could speak to them, I'd tell them not to mourn. My life has been fruitful and happy because of them; they've given me everything a dog could want.\n\nSo that's me, ladies and gents. I can feel my body getting tired now, and I'm starting to prepare myself for the long sleep. ",

            "comment": "There was a moment when I realized new owner wasn't going to hurt me.  She was working in the basement, and I had gotten a hold of one of her gloves.  It smelled nice, so I started chewing on it.  I hear her say suddenly \"What *is* that noise?\"  When she came and saw what I was doing, she got mad, and her hands went up so I shrank and tried to make myself as little as possible.  Then I heard her say \"Oh my god, I wasn't going to hurt you.\"  She knelt down and hugged me.  I knew then what my new home was going to be like.\n\nI don't remember much about old owner.  I still have the white spot on my nose from where I tried to push my way out of the crate he put me in.  He left me alone a lot.  When new owner came to the shelter, I was in another cage, and I barked and snarled at anyone who came near me.  But she asked to take me for a walk, and she knew somehow that I wasn't a bad dog.  I just didn't like to be in small spaces.  She never left me in one again.  Her and an older lady who smelled like her took me a long way in the rumbling cage with seats.  I don't like those.  I throw up in them sometimes.  But it was worth it.  My new home had a nice big backyard and a fence I could bark at.\n\nNew owner wasn't home all the time, but the older lady was most of the time, making clicking sounds in front of a bright square.  She would let me sit with her until new owner came home.  I really liked that, I was never alone anymore.  New owner took me for lots of long walks when she came home.  If she got mad at me, she usually ended up laughing afterwards or sometimes even hugging me.  Except that time I chased the skunk, then she had to walk me a really, really long way to get smelly stuff and water poured over me.  There was an older man there, too, who kind of smelled like her and who treated me nicely too.  Sometimes he brought me bones and would let me outside if I whined.  The older ones would walk me sometimes when owner was sick.\n\nLately, I haven't been able to walk as far or as long, and my tummy hurts a lot.  New owner took me to the place that smelled kind of like the skunk shampoo and where I would scare all the other dogs.  She argued with the older ones a couple times after.  They took me a few times.  After the last one, new owner cried a bunch.  But then she spent all week with me.  She fed me all kinds of food I had never been allowed before.  She even slept on the upstairs couch beside me so I didn't have to go up and down the stairs.\n\nHer and the older man are taking me back to the smelly place now, I can tell.  They always smell different when they take me there.  She seems like she's trying to keep from crying, and when she smiles at me I can tell she's hurting inside a lot.  She's barely aged at all since I first met her, still young and full of energy.  I've been getting more and more tired, and I wish I could keep up with her.  I wish my tummy didn't hurt so much, or that they could fix it like the skunk smell.  The one in the white coat and her talk for a bit, and then they poked me with one of the little needles.  As the world went dark, I felt her arms tight around me, and heard her say over and over that she loved me, and that I was a good dog.\n\n--PS:  This was actually my experience with a shelter rescue (part German Shepard) that I had to put down 6 years ago.  We only got 5 years together, and I still miss him terribly.  Putting him down was the single hardest thing I've ever had to do.  Wherever he came from, if you gave him a good home, then you should be proud.  I'm sorry for your loss.",

            "comment": "Your German Shepard, a brown and black dog(sorry dont own a dog so i cant do a better description of his fur pattern) who saved my son. This is his story, the story of my sons savior. The story of a hero when no one else could or would be one because of the circumstances. The story of your dog, Henry. Thank you. so much.  My wife, and me, in our late 30's were scared, stuck out side our home as it burnt down in front of us.Barely Getting out alive the blaze tore up our house so fast we had no clue what to do in the chaos that ensured but try to get out.Save our lives. We would always hate ourselves for our self preservation but in the moment we had no clue what was going on, what ended up hating ourselves for this.. there is no excuse. yeah.. were shit parents. i can.. never... admit this... to...him, our son. We knew we left our son behind in h is crib but there was nothing we could do after we realized this after the fact. My wife Maria crying on her knees, pulling at me and begging for someone to go JUST go inside and save our son as we realized what we had left behind, me holding her back but wanting to run inside just as much if not more as her, and crying so hard i knew the futility of doing so. With our SON trapped inside a blaze we both knew there was no going into and coming out of alive we were unable to make a decision. Knowing we were shit parents the longer our decision took to make. The blaze held our son in a crucible of fire and we swear we could hear him screaming in his crib.When suddenly we.. thought.. we saw a... Brown flash, quick, like the wind, no cops or firemen could even stop it, even acknowledge it, they just said we needed to stand back and let them do their job. they were just as confused as us by it but wouldn't acknowledge what they may have seen.. We hear the sounds of timbers burnt and weakened by fire from the insdie of our house and hearing everything we paid for and worked hard for our whole lives  for crash down in just a flashing moment,  but in that moment we think nothing of the flash of what ended up being fur and honestly heroics. We hear the cry of our son from inside the burning timbers and housing, we cry harder knowing its real this time and not in our heads, we wring our hands, hold our heads together, and cry harder knowing there is nothing that can be done, knowing that its futile to run inside and die amongst the blaze trying. knowing we are shit parents for understanding this.  Suddenly that blown flash happens again, we smell smoke, burnt fur on the wind? no were just hoping and delusional as we cry our eyes out holding each other, and we hear.. our crying son. this time. its in front of us. crying. we can not believe our eyes. he.is.alive. a smoking bundle of blanket and his crying visage. Shawn. our SON. is ALIVE. we have who to thank for? not the fire men, they couldn't get inside the blaze, no one, not any one could get inside this blaze. The brown flash is all i can think of. no one else would go inside and save our child. they all said it was impossible as t hey held us back. NO MATTER how much we tried. we... knew.. they were.. right... it was going to kill us as a couple, kill us as parents and ruing us for life but... here our son was..  Here he was with the smoke in my eyes coming off my sons blankets, hardly beleving he was alive, saved, by you Henry, THANK YOU SO MUCH. You risked your life for my son and i will always thank you for that. THANK YOU. WE my whole FAMILY thanks you. So much. Thank you for allowing us to be a whole family still. For putting your life on the line for someone youd idnt know. thank you for saving us. Thank you.",

His smile made the little wrinkles around his eyes deepen a little. His eyes were icy blue, but filled with warmth and compassion. His hands were gnarled like old tree roots, but still held strength to match that of a much younger man. \n\nHe would reply that he loved the solitude, and the company. He would be far from the chaos of society, and close to the serenity of nature. His charges were dear to him, like family, and he sported numerous scars from defending his herd from desperate wolves. He had helped give birth to innumerable lambs, he had ended the suffering of the hurt and elderly. To the gentle minds of the sheep he watched over, he must have been like a god. A god who watched over them, who gave both life and death. \n\nOne morning, Hans didn\u2019t rise from his make-shift bed of pine branches. The sheep milled around in confusion, but Hans never stirred again. When his spirit left his body, it went to where all spirits go when their time on earth is up. He met with all the spirits who he had watched over, and they ushered him on to meet his maker. He saw or heard nothing, yet a voice spoke in his head. \n\n**HANS. YOU HAVE BEEN KIND AND GENTLE WITH THE LIVES YOU HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE OF. YOUR SPIRIT WILL LIVE ON, IN ANOTHER FORM, THAT YOU MAY BRING JOY TO THE WORLD ONCE MORE.** \n\nAfter that, silence. Hans thought to himself, \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a dog...\u201d he felt a tug, then a shift as he left the ethereal plane. He left behind him the part that was Hans. A sensation of warmth and darkness followed, and Hans was gone forever. \n\n*Fin*\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. May you find peace and move on with your life \u2764\ufe0f",

It looks abandoned from the outside, but it's not - you can smell the people in there, as well as the other smells, the ones you've been trained to seek out. \n\nYour trainer's in his funny dark suit and you follow him as he and his pack fall upon the warehouse. \n\n\n\"POLICE! FREEZE!

You lick his hand in mute supplication. \"Go\", your trainer croaks, \"run, now\", and ever obedient, you do. \n\nYou run along alleyways and crowded streets until you reach the edges of the city. You're tired and hungry so you forage for a bit and then go back to sleep. You start walking again and your collar gets caught in a fence you're trying to squeeze through. With enough effort and sawing with your back teeth, you manage to get it off and leave it behind. \n\nIt's a few days before you reach the area with houses and people. It's not like the city, though. It's greener. Quieter. There are other dogs around. It's another day before you meet your new master. \n\nHe's young - much too young to be any sort of trainer - but he has an open, kind face, and seems unexpectedly excited to see you. He takes you into the house and feeds you. \n\nThis isn't anything like training. For the first few days you're still confused, on high alert, and you growl at anyone who tries to pet you - except for your master. After a while, though, when nothing bad happens - to you, or to your master - you decide that maybe it's okay to relax. \n\nMaybe you've finally found a place that's safe.\n",

More terror. Grey everywhere.\n\nThe Man dragged me on my leash, and where I was standing, a large chunk of building fell. The humans were running everywhere.\n\nI was scared. Where was my human? Was my human okay?\n\nThe grey surrounded me everywhere, covering the humans and I. What was happening?\n\n\"A plane has crashed into the World Trade Center!\" one of the humans said. \"We're live in New York City. Would you look at that.\"\n\n\nMy human! What if my human was in that building? The Man held my leash firmly, but I wanted to go to the building, I *had* to see if my owner was safe.\n\nWith a pull, I bounded away far from the Man who was holding me firmly by the leash. Running as fast as my legs would carry me, I went deeper and deeper into the grey. It grew hotter. I started to cough.\n\n*Humans,* I thought. *So many humans, but I must save my owner,* I thought. But then I thought again. There were other dogs that would miss their owners. Without them, they would go back into the bad place. They might be killed. They'll never know a home again.\n\nOn I went, digging through the rubble. There were sharp pieces of metal. There was fire. There was smoke. None of these things would stop me from saving my human-- no, *the* humans. All the humans I could.\n\nI felt a shaking under my paws. I sniffed-- there was a human! Willing myself, I dug as far as I could into the rubble until I saw human flesh. I barked, hoping the humans could come help this human. I had to save more humans.\n\nThe humans came! Wagging my tail, I pointed to the human. With their special human tools, the human was free and sent off in a truck. *Hopefully she's okay,* I thought.\n\nOn and on this went, through the noon, afternoon, finding more and more humans. There were so many humans... how could such a bad thing happen? I had found 53 humans so far, and each one had been safe and sound. Then I heard a familiar voice.\n\n\"Help me,\" it said. I don't understand human-speak, but this human *definitely* needed help. There was lots of blood.\n\n\nAs loud as I could, I let out a howl. It rang out, until the humans came. This time around, they stared for a while. I pulled at their clothing-- they needed to hurry. \"Dig her out!\" one of the humans said. This time around, I helped the humans. It had to be done as fast as possible.\n\n*You seem familiar,* I thought.\n\nIt was all too familiar.\n\nIt was my owner.\n\n\"This person is dead,\" the same human said. \"Carry her off.\"\n\nI sensed sadness in the air. What was wrong with my human?\n\nThey carried her off, and the next moments felt as it they were going by at godspeed.\n\nChasing the ambulance. Following human. Bad men came. I slept.\n\n\nI woke up. There were metal bars.\n\n*No,* I thought. *No, no, NO!!!*\n\nThe Kennel. My human must be dead.\n\nI didn't eat, and I hardly drank, for the next few days. My human was the love of my life. No point in living anymore. \n\nI was in the kennel for 5 years. No one loved me, for my scars had earned my a bad reputation, even among the dogs. Rumor went around that I had killed humans. That I killed my owner. Every night I would cry. I wanted to die.\n\n\nOne night, I drifted off to sleep. I woke up in a white room. A female human walked in, all dressed in white. I had a bad feeling about this. She had a syringe in her hand, and was walking towards me. Then she passed by me. I looked backward, and saw a dog-child. She was quite young, and her fur was quite matted. It seemed as if her owner never loved her. She stared at me, then closed her eyes as the syringe went in. She laid down, stirred, and never woke up. Then, the human lady walked up to me and said \"Okay, you're next big guy.\"\n\n\nNo. I wasn't ready. I couldn't go out in such a way. The raw instinct inside of me was unleashed, and images of my human appeared. My human wouldn't want this to happen to me.\n\nBounding through the room. Running head on into doors. Smelling fresh air. I hadn't smelled fresh air in ages! It was as if I was reborn. It was green. It smelled like grass. \n\nThe humans were chasing me. They had large leashes. They had guns. They were going to kill me! \n\n\nI paused for a moment. Where would I go? There was a little town nearby. I didn't know it at all. The humans would. Then there was a forest. Every dog knew the forests, but not the humans. And off I went. I would live here. This is what my human would have wanted.\n\nI wandered in the forest for many a light. There was little food, but I was free. No more kennel for me. Sometimes I wonder if I should have never ran from the white room. Maybe I should have died. Dogs believed that when they died, they would see their human in the afterlife. I wanted to see my owner again. I wanted to be loved.\n\nMany months had passed since I had seen a human. I was growing old. I had forgotten about the humans. On a rainy day, I heard a quiet murmur. It sounded familiar, like it was something I had known all my life. I walked to it, then ran, then almost flew. I was... curious. Adrenaline filled me, I needed to know. \n\nIt was a human. I looked at the human, and the human saw me. The human looked scared. I had scars and matted fur. The human probably didn't like me. I walked off, when it started talking in an excited voice.\n\n\"Here boy! Come 'ere!\"\n\nWas she talking to me? I cautiously went towards the human. She held her hand out. I sniffed it. She patted me and I yelped in fear. Then our gazes locked. *How about that,* I thought. She fumbled around, and pulled out a piece of meat. She threw it in the air, and it fell on the ground. *Yum,* I thought. *I like this human already.*\n\n\nWhat I didn't know then was that she would be my friend for the rest of my life. We would grow together, and I would love her, and she would love me. She gave me the one thing I had wanted since my old owner had died. She had given me love. Not just any kind of love. She would die for me, and I would die for her. \n\n* * *\n\n\"Are you ready big guy? You're going on an adventure *all by yourself.*\" She wept. I loved adventures, but something was off. She loved our adventures, and she was crying.\n\n\nShe walked with me into a room. She left, and I pawed at the door. I was weak. I was old. A woman called me to sit on a table, and she was holding a syringe. \n\nMy time had come. Was it over already?\n\nYes.\n\nI had been loved, I had given love, I saved, I have been saved. I lived a good life.\n\nWith one little prick. I felt all the emotions I felt in my life in an instant, and I was gone. I truly had lived a good life.",

When the men came I was so excited. It's always fun to see new faces. Oh, the smells that come along with a new person!\n\nI sat at the window watching as they walked up to the door. If I wasn't stuck in the front room I would have run straight up to them to say hi. I would have wanted so bad to jump up on them but I've been told I shouldn't do that. That really sucks because I like getting close to people.\n\nIf I wasn't stuck in the front room I might have been able to do something. He walked out with the men and he got in the back of the car they came in. He didn't look happy. He turned around and looked at me through the back window as they drove off.\n\nI don't know how long it is now that I've been alone. Too long. Now's my chance to leave though. I recognised the smell of the man in the suit right away. I didn't really like him. When I'd seen him before he never wanted to pet me. He tried not to look at me. \n\nHe's come into the house and I can hear him in the kitchen. Maybe he's getting me some food. It doesn't matter. I want to leave. I have to leave. He's opened the door and just standing there looking at me. I want to run but he's blocking the door. It's felt like forever. He's turned around and gone up stairs. \n\nI look around the room one last time and breathe in deep. One last big smell. There's no need to run. I take my time as I walk out. Normally we go to the right. that's where the park is. Today though... I go left.",

My mother is a know-it-all, because she\u2019s all-knowing, and she\u2019s incredibly controlling, because she\u2019s the creator of everything. \n\n\u201cBut Mom, don\u2019t you feel that? This one is special! When will you ever let me keep one?\u201d \n\nI had tried this on her with many earth forms before, but this particular one felt different. Overflowing with unconditional love and beautiful, positive energy. The brightest parts of infinity. \n\n\u201cOf course I feel it, honey. I created this puppy. But I didn\u2019t do it for us, I did it for someone else. A family on earth who is in need.\u201d \n\nI began to cry. \n\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d she began to rub my back, \u201csome day you will see this puppy again, after it has changed earth for the better, and someday later than that you will take my place and you will understand that we have all the love we will ever need right here, because we are eternal and infinite, just like the love inside this little Shepard.\u201d\n\nI knew she was right. She always is, because she always is. \n\n\u201cGo on doggie, go toward the light,\u201d I shouted, \u201cbring them love! I\u2019ll see you someday soon!\u201d\n\nThe little dog barked in understanding and disappeared into the shining tower of infinite light.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI\u2019m so sorry to hear about your dog, but nothing can take away the beautiful memories and all the love that a pet brings with it.

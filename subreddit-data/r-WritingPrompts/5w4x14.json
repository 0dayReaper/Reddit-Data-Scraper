Jesus had many more disciples than 12.\n\n_____\n\n**The Book of Rad**\n\nRad 2:1\n\nOn the fifth week day a bachelor party took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus had been invited, along with a plus one. So Jesus brought his apostle Chad as his plus one, and Brad as Chad's plus one's plus one.\n\nChad scoped out the joint before turning to Jesus and saying to him, \"JC, my man. There is nowhere near enough wine here for all of these people to get plastered.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" Jesus replied. \"Bring me the barrels of wine.\"\n\nBrad and Chad began to lift the barrels before turning to Jesus once more. \"JC, could you just come over here? It would be a lot easier. These are heavier than a man-eating whale!\"\n\nSo Jesus approached the barrels of wine and blessed them. Chad filled a chalice from the barrel and took a sip.\n\nChad sung with joy, \"Hard liquor! The Lord has blessed us with hard liquor!\"\n\nAnd so all the guests got turnt higher than the heavens.",

Does he inherit the punishment of his parents' sins?\"\n\n\"Neither this man nor his parents sinned,\" replied Jesus, \"well, I mean, I'm sure they've all sinned multiple times at many points throughout their lives. That's not why he's deaf, though.\"\n\nChad asked Christ, \"JC, could you get some miracle whip going and let him hear the voices of friends and cackling of fire? That would be sicker than a leper that hasn't touched you.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" Jesus said, \"my dudes.\"\n\nThen Jesus caked mud onto the man's ears. The deaf man, confused, slapped Jesus' cheek. Jesus turned his face, exposing his other cheek.\n\nChad asked the deaf man, \"Hey bozo, you copy?\"\n\nThe deaf man made a noise that only someone that has been deaf for their whole life up until this moment would make. And so he could hear.\n\n_____\n\nI can write more if you want, but know that each story will get more absurd and contain more stereotypes as I continue.",

He showed compassion on them and healed their sick.\n\nAs the sun set, Brad said to Jesus, \"These people look like they're starving, JC. Send them all home with enough money to buy themselves food.\"\n\nJesus looked out to the crowed and replied to Brad, \"I will not give them riches. I just told you this earlier- blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of God. Hand me your fish sandwich.\"\n\nBrad replied, \"JC, you have been touching sick people all day. But if that is your will, then it shall be done.\"\n\nAnd so Brad gave Jesus his fish sandwich. Jesus gave thanks to the lord and split the sandwich. Then he handed a piece of the sandwich to the people in the crowd. They all ate and were satisfied. The number of those who ate was about four hundred.\n\nChad said to Jesus, \"JC you clever man! Instead of handing these people riches to buy food, you hand them food to eat. Do not ever let a Jew tell you that you are not one of them!\"",

Not my will, but the Father's be done. As lame as..\"\n\n\"There's gotta be like hella possessed people around here\" Brad interrupted.\n\n\"Brooo, JC could totally exercise those demons and shove em in some stupid animals! That would be some real Israel-in-the-desert type God shit right there, yo!\" Chad exclaimed. \n\nQuietly the three of them snuck off into the night leaving Simon-Peter to give a very awkward speech in the Messiah's stead.\n\nMatthew 8:31\n",

We have such a fantasized image of Jesus these days, it really under appreciates who Jesus really was.\n\nWithout getting too deep since we're in /r/WritingPrompts... Even among Christians, Jesus' persona can be diluted. For example, many Christians think Jesus advocated blanket forgiveness. This is incorrect. He advocated for quick forgiveness to those who ask for it - as salvation works. Some think Jesus was 100% a pacifist, yet told disciples to buy swords. People often use Jesus as an example for giving to social programs, but that's only half true and for different reasons. He taught to give freely, nothing about forcing a tax upon people. But, at the same time, he does say to give to the government (Caesar) what is owed.\n\nI think there's a lot of secular (and obviously spiritual) knowledge to be gained from learning about him. Even if you disregard all the spiritual aspects, there's a lot of social takeaways. He was just such a pragmatic person.",

Thus he pumped, and Brad pumped, at it was good. \n",

Christ, man, I thought we were just gonna get our munchies on. None of this gay talk about swallowing you.\"\n\n\"Come on guys, this is a serious occasion, just go with it.\" beckoned Jesus.\n\nChad stood up from his table \"Lord, I didn't come here this stoned to listen to you tell us to down this loaf like it's hanging from your crotch. I thought we were gonna talk about how to KO that bitch Caesar.\"\n\nJesus sighed. \"Guys, we never said we would harm Caesar. Why do you two always berate me like this every time?\"\n\n\"Hear me out, bro. You did say 'Give to Caesar what is Caesars', right? Well I'm thinking we gotta give that guy a new asshole!\" Exclaimed Chad.\n\nBrad nodded with approval. \"Foresure, bro. Gotta get all thunder and lightning on his ass. Mess him up so good chicks would rather bang a leper.\"\n\n\"Nice, bro\" Chad said with a fist bump. \n\nThe rest of the apostles sat silently, watching this almost routine banter.\n\nNow Jesus got up \"Listen you two, I don't mean to make this seem more important than it is. But I kind of don't expect to be around much longer and I have some things I gotta leave you with before I go.\"\n\nBrad put a hand on Jesus' shoulder. \"Jesus don't be a pussy, only thing you gotta leave us with is some serious ammunition and Chad and I can run things fine. Go all kaboom on them!\"\n\n\"What?\" said Jesus.\n\n\"KABOOOOOOM!!!!!\" cried Brad and Chad with exploding hand gestures.\n\n\"No. No threatening or hurting anyone.\" Jesus said, as angry as a son of God could reasonably get. \"Don't make me call upon my father.\"\n\n\"Which father? The one who can't even bone your mom?\" remarked Chad.\n\"Or the one you keep talking about yet we never seem actually see?\" said Brad. \"Face it dude, you're in denial.\" \n\"DE-NIE-ULL.\"\n\"And we're not even in Egypt. Israeli sad.\"\nBrad and Chad looked at each other with satisfaction at their punny roast on Christ.\n\nJesus was finished. \"That's it. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of you. You two will never again be mentioned or remembered again if you keep this up. I just wanted a nice dinner and you two ruined it. It's disgusting. I'm tired of your antics. If you can't pipe down just...just leave.\"\n\nChad shook his head, \"Wow, I didn't know you could turn EVERYTHING into whine. Whatever, this sausage fest was lame anyway. No chicks or anything. Let's go Brad.\" \n\n\"There were never going to be 'chicks'. That was never part of our mission\"\n\nBrad started motioning to the door. \"Well that didn't stop Simon and us from convincing these brothel girls great riches if they blew us.\"\n\nSimon looked up in panic. \"Uh that didn't happen.\"\n\nChad looked surprised. \"Come on, you remember Becky from last week?\"\n\n\"I don't know a Becky!\" Simon cried.\n\n\"Yeah you do\" said Chad.\n\n\"No I don't!\"\n\n\"Do too!\" screamed Brad and Chad as they headed toward the door.\n\n\"OUT YOU TWO!\" Jesus said.\n\n\"Yeah yeah, we're leaving. But just know this. This is THE LAST supper we are ever having!!\" Brad said.\n\n\"The LAAAAST!!!\" added Chad.\n\nAs Brad opened the door, Chad whispered to Judas on the way out \"Beeteedubs, Jesus has you on the end cause he says you wreak of B.O.\"\n\nAnd with that the two left history forever...\n\n ",

I swear to God!\" Chad added, rumpling his goatee, and swirling his starry cape.\n\nI sighed in exasperation.\n\n\"Do not take the name of thy Lord in vain\", I mumbled under my voice. \n\nBut the sprawling crowd of sailors, and carpenters, and herdsmen, and washerwomen were lapping it up. I suppose Jesus was a pretty unconventional religious leader, right? He mixed with prostitutes. He went wandering off into the desert for months on end. He anointed us\u2014his trusty disciples\u2014in that sweet, sweet kanabos oil, and sent us off flying into the sky.\n\nUntil those sneering Roman bastards crucified him he was a pretty chill guy.\n\nMaybe that's why Brad and Chad listened to Jesus when most everyone else was mocking him. Even me.\n\nStill. I wish they wouldn't blaspheme so much. And they're taking the whole kanabos thing to a new level. Blazing up ounces and ounces of the stuff with Mary Magdalene and Simon Peter. John the Baptist used to get *pissed*. He told me the smoke gave him a ringing headache.\n\nAnd heaven knows what they are trying to do in the Dead Sea with those wooden boards. They call it \"surfing\". A mighty waste of time.\n\nI shook my head. I think I'll leave all of their antics out of my gospel.",

He walked into their room and stopped.\u201dGod help me,\u201d he muttered. \u201cGuys...guys, what did you do.\u201d\n\nThe laughing increased in intensity.\n\nJesus massaged his temples. \u201cI swear if the emperor\u2019s wine turned into piss again\u2026\u201d\n\nFinally they controlled themselves. \u201cJesus, that piss thing was hysterical and you know it,\u201d Chad said.\n\nJesus pressed his lips together trying not to laugh, remembering the look on the Emperor;s face when he had taken the sip of the \u201cvintage\u201d wine. Brad and Chad smirked knowingly at him, but he shook his head in what Jesus hoped was a stern gesture. \u201cSeriously, I need to know, guys. I can reduce the fallout if I find out *early.*\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me, Jesus,\u201d Chad said, \u201cthere\u2019s no way this one gets out.\u201d Jesus looked skeptical, but Brad continued, \u201canyways why did you come here anyways? You need something?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we need to make a statement condemning the emperor,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cwould be good to have all the apostles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he do now?\u201d Brad asked. \n\n\u201cJust an hour ago he announced he\u2019s divorcing the queen, even though he had *three* children!\u201d\n\nThe laughter that came then put the earlier one to shame.  \n\n***\n\nIf you enjoyed check out my sub, [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting)\n",

            "comment": "The fledgling priest stared at the scrolls that were just laid in front of him.  \"What are these?  More historical documents that I need to study?\"\n\nThe Bishop, wrinkled with age, lifted his hands to adjust his glasses.  \"Those are the forbidden gospels.  Scholars of old deemed them inappropriate for the masses, but the church still wanted to keep them as historical records.\"\n\nThe priest looked up at the old man.  \"You're kidding, right?  Are you telling me that we have been hiding doctrine from the parish?  That in itself seems like a sin, as we are hiding the words of God... Isn't all scripture God-breathed and useful for teaching, as stated by Paul in his letter to Timothy?\n\nThe Bishop nodded, \"You are correct, but this... is a bit different.\"  The old bishop lifted the scroll again.  \"Here, you are getting into the position in which you can decide for yourself as to whether or not you share these with your own parish.\"\n\nThe priest slowly unrolled the ancient scrolls.  \"What is this writing...?  Greek? Latin? I can't make it out...\"\n\nThe Bishop let out a sigh.  \"No, those are just scribbles of a drunk man.  We think he was trying to doodle a beast or something about the end times...  As you can see at the bottom there, the line just kind of trails off, as if he fell asleep from the booze.\"\n\nThe priest furrowed his brow.  \"This is all some horrible joke.\"\n\nThe Bishop shook his head.  \"I wish it was... but what sits in front of you is the book of Chad.  Keep opening the scroll.  Eventually, you will get to the greek text, written by Chad himself.  Read it, translate it, and tell me what you think.\"\n\nThe priest began to read from the scroll and translated it into English as he went along.  \n\n*\"The Book of Chad, Chapter one.  -  On a particular day, my brother Brad and myself-\"*\n\nThe Bishop held up his hand.  \"Hold it... It isn't 'brother'.  The word is actually close buddy, or *bro*.\n\nThe priest blinked in protest...  \"Alright then.  *On a particular day, my bro Brad and myself were wicked thirsty.  We were in serious need of some 'Nectar of the gods' and needed some shade too.  We came across a wedding.  Not knowing anyone, we crashed it and quickly became the life of the party.  The thing about parties, though, is eventually the booze runs dry.  That is when it is time to move on and sleep it off until the next party to crash.  But lo, a simple man, the son of a carpenter was also there, with his Mom.  She complained that we drank all the wine, and asked the man named Jesus to do something about it.  Expecting a fight, we braced ourselves, but instead, the man filled some jugs with water and blessed them.  We thought the man was a nut, but some of the damnedest best wine started flowing from them jugs.  We were impressed beyond belief, and there we realized we could get all the free booze we wanted if we followed this man around.\"*\n\nThe priest sat there, unsure of what he just read.  \"So... these gospels were written by men constantly plastered?\"\n\nThe bishop nodded.  \"That is precisely why we can't share them.  Being a drunkard is a sin.\"\n\nThe priest sat back in thought.  \"Yes... But Jesus came to seek and save the lost...\"\n\nThe Bishop looked at the man.  \"I am getting up in age, and as I said earlier, you are coming into a position in which you can do what you want.\"\n\nThe priest smiled.  \"I have a friend in Ireland who is a priest, he may benefit from these.\"  \n\n------------------\n\nYou can check out some more of my writing over at my subreddit.  /r/vintnerwrites   ",

I awoke first- from the glory of god shining down into the dirty room. The light bouncing off of empty bottles and onto not only my face, but also Mary's glistening snatch. Note that this was before me and my bro had met the holiest of all bro's, the son of party: Sleazus Christ. I tried to wake Chad for a sneaky escape, but in his drunken stupor he thought my shaking of him was someone attempting to draw graven images on his face, and so awoke loudly and violently, and with great swearing at your bro. In my own stupor his flashing of fists aroused my own anger, and so it came to pass that there was a great catching of hands by both parties; stirring our sultry host. Her babeliness giggled at our anger, and called to us for a truce and a return to a bonding of flesh. So here it was that the son of God came to see his on the low girlfriend for a romantic morning together, only to discover her with two dicks in her mouth, shouting a muffled \"hey baby!\", her teeth irritating the flesh of your dearest bro. Jesus sighed, removing his tunic \"Alright bro's hurry up in there, it must be my turn soon.\" Too which chad replied, \"Yo dog theres plenty of room in the back\" so it came to pass that the holy foursome was consecrated with leftover wine and non-homoerotic touching of balls. When all were satisfied, His Broliness, pulled a joint from Mary's hair, saying \"This is my grass, lay with it, and feel the glory of god shine upon you.\" Thus the Big Sleazy pulled a joint from Mary's hair for each of us and we lay in the sun. After an hour, none of our joints needed ashing, none of us were hungover, and all of us were right on the cusp of being too high, and yet were still functioning. It was in this moment that Chad and i decided we would dedicate all of our parties to this man, the chillest bro to ever chill. \"We wanna party with you for eternity bro!\" I exclaimed, chad followed \" Yeah man; aint no party like a JC party cause a JC party don't stop!\" There following a slapping of hands and a shredding of air guitars. Big Sleazy, thusly being satisfied by our performance, and sheer display of overall broliness brought us into the crew, where me and chad would one day share in sainthood as the holy bros of party.",

            "comment": "The Gospels According to Brad:\n\nAfter their dissent in Damascus, Chad and Brad were sent to Adath, in the lands of the Samaritans.  Paul bade them to shoulder the greatest challenge of any of the disciples, and to bring the word of The Lord to those that openly mocked the followers of Christ.  Chad insisted that it was actually a punishment and humiliation for their behaviour at the Last Supper, that it was really a slight.  But Chad doesn't know shit.\n\nWhen they came to Adath, the sun was low on the horizon and the two disciples were weary from their long voyage.  Chad had forgotten to water both their camels at the last oasis, only giving his own camel the Lord's gift of water in the desert.  So the disciples arrived sand-blown and tired, ridding double-hump on one camel.\n\nThe land of Samar was in the middle of a harvest festival, and Adath was filled with merrymakers.  Just as their Lord before them, Brad and Chad were unable to find any room in the inns.  Brad knew it was a sign from the Lord, blessing their mission.  He looked for a manger, that they may follow in their God's footsteps.  However, the closest thing to a manger was a chicken coop that an incredulous stall vendor agreed to let them for the night, provided his chickens could bed with them.  But not in the Biblical sense.  Because that is wrong.  We did hash that over before, but to avoid anyone saying that's only Old Testament stuff, we're gonna mention it again:  Don't fuck chickens.  Or cloven-hoof animals.  Or the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea, or the lizards that walk the sand.  Any animal really.  The only think you're allowed to bang is humans.  Preferably in a heterosexual monogamous union ordained and approved by the local church authority.  Subject to all applicable fees and taxes.  Sex toys might be okay, but they also might fall under the category of masturbation.  Because of ongoing litigation between Durex and the church, our attorney has asked us not to comment on the matter.\n\nAnyways, There Chad and Brad laid their heads, among the chickens.  Chad was a real buzzkill about the whole ordeal, but it was clearly a sign the Lord had good things planned for the two devotees.  When morning came, the two emerged, feather-spattered and unrested, but ready to do Paul's bidding.  They set up shop right near the chicken coup, near a bustling fountain, to begin their sermon.  Chad was totally oblivious to how convenient their accommodations right in the market were.\n\nWhile the villagers drew their morning buckets, Chad and Brad stood next to the trickling water and told the pagans the Word of the Lord.  Some of them looked to the noble figures, silhouetted by the rising sun.  However, most of them paid no heed.  Their eyes were sunken and red.  They shuffled as though the weight of the Devil was upon them.  After a few hours, Chad finally asked an old woman why no one was paying attention to them.\n\nThe bent crone told them they were in the middle of the Winter Festival.  The revelry had lasted late into the night and the villagefolk were feeling the after effects of the wine that was customary at the festival.  Undaunted, Chad and Brad continued their preaching.\n\nAt noon, across the fountain, emerged a local holy man.  He wore no shirt, just pants in the style of MC of Hammers.  His long dreadlocks were beaded with bright ornaments that twinkled when he nodded his head with great enthusiasm, which he did often.  The crowd cheered when he took his place opposite Chad and Brad.  A fervent follower threw him a hand harp from the masses and the he began to strum it while a circle of drummers dropped him a beat.  He began to sing in a style unknown to Chad and Brad.  It went thus:\n\nWoke up quick at about noon\n\nJust knew that I had to be proselytizin' soon\n\nI gotta get drunk before the day begins\n\nBefore Demeter's pain really sets in\n\nAbout to go and that gin got me near blind\n\n--At this point he gestured rudely at Chad and Brad--\n\nYoung niggaz was here, throwing up Christ signs\n\nSo I ran to my bros and I grabbed my harp\n\nI got the beat here and side to side.\n\n\nThe crowd even sang along in perfect stereo to 'side to side.'  If there was one thing that Chad and Brad could agree on, it was that the devil's hand had been at work that day.  The  priest's demonic chanting continued for some time.  His words were not from any song they had heard before.  And it hinted at pagan prophecy, because he sang about Chad and Brad, though no songs had ever been composed about them before.  Likely, they will sing of Chad and Brad in the future, but they hadn't at that point.  Yet the man's lyrics called them out by name.  The warlock conjured up facts about them, some of them eerily accurate, like Chad's celibacy, and Brad's mother's past as a destitute prostitute in the streets of Jerusalem.\n\nIt got quite graphic.\n\nChad and Brad both tried their best to summon words from thin air as the warlock did.  They asked the Lord above, in the name of their saviour, to grant them this gift of rhythmic song conjuring.  The Lord's blessing was not with them.  They attempted to draw attention to the man's strange manner of hair.  But the crowd jeered at their attempts and lauded the Warlock's 'sick dreads.'\n\nDespite his almost-complete musical undergrad, Chad wasn't able to muster anything near the power of the Demonic Warlock.  He parleyed with an off-beat and stuttering insult at the likelihood that the Demonic Warlock was inflicted with venereal disease because of the numerous sexual encounters he boasted of.  And that that was a mighty blow on him from the Lord Above.\n\nThat's when the rocks started flying.\n\nIt began as a light barrage of handfuls of sand and pebbles.  But Chad had to go and make one last comment about the local honey mead and it quickly escalated to a bombardment.  Some of the missiles lobbed were as big as two fists held together.  And like a big guy's fists.  And Samaritans have really good throwing arms.  It isn't that important of a detail, but Chad insisted that it be included in these gospels since we flipped a coin to see who had to write about this part, and he said he just wasn't going to mention any of this in his book.\n\nSo it was, that as the sun dipped low on the horizon, the two champions of God's word were chased by a throng of mindless zombies conjured up by the Mouth of Satan who had manifested himself as a dreadlocked Demon Warlock with music and mind-control powers.\n\nIn the chaos that ensued, they couldn't find their camel and were chased from the city on bare feet.  Alone in the cold desert, the two disciples ran until they were pretty sure they couldn't see any torches or pitchforks in the distance.  They both agreed they were at an all-time low.  Clearly, the Lord was testing them.  Without fuel to make a fire, Chad and Brad laid with each-other in a shallow cave.   NOT in the Biblical sense.  Though it might be cool if people do that.  We're still not totally sure.  Also, pending litigation, we can't state our...  yadda yadda yadda.\n\nThe smaller spoon, Chad, asked over his shoulder, as the cold wind blew in, if they were going to be okay?  Or if they might perish of exposure in alarmingly fast dropping temperatures.  Brad thought sagely and whispered in his brother's ear: It is clear the Lord is testing us, and we must simply stay the course.  Besides, they had done as the other disciples had asked.  They had made the long journey, found accommodation, and preached the Word of God.  Sure, there were some snags, but God was clearly just following the three act structure.  They had arrived victorious, been defeated by Satan Himself Incarnate, but, for real, what mortals could hope to stand up to Satan Himself Incarnate?  The had fought hard, but been bested.  Now that the second act was over, it was their turn to win.\n\nThat seemed to calm Chad enough, because he answered only with quiet snores.  Under the icy moonlight, in dangerously cooling temperatures, the two disciples slept, spoon to spoon, safe in the knowledge that the worst was behind them, and that God would send them a mentor who would teach them awesome powers.  Then they could fight Satan in a 2v1.  Though, that would still be unfair.  Brad's thoughts became more and more muddled and he decided to stop writing about their day and get some sleep too.  But, for real, it's getting really cold.  There's frost on the sand dunes and everything.\n\nThankfully, they did wake in the morning.  However, it appeared the second act wasn't totally over, because Chad lost three fingers to frostbite.  Two from one hand, three from the other, and Brad had to cut them off to prevent gangrene.  It was really gross and Chad still hasn't said thank you.  Even though he had been delirious and resisted so hard that Brad had to knock him unconscious and tie him down before he could perform the life-saving surgery.\n\nTo be continued in The Gospels According to Brad, Chapter Two: The First Legit Rap Battle In History.  With way more music.  Also, a few cameos from other major Biblical figures that wanted to try and piggyback and Chad and Brad's early success.\n\nEDIT: Sorry about the typos.  If there was dollar bills involved, I'd give a fuck. -Chad",

            "comment": "1.At that time, Jesus brought his apostles to him, for he had rolled a joint. It was known among the followers of Jesus that his father was the best among all growers, so it was with great haste that the apostles gathered round him. 2.Once all had taken their places, Jesus held his joint aloft, for all to see. \"Fetch me a light,\" he declared; and it was done. 3.Jesus did take the first drag, christening the joint with his christly lips. \"Into this doobie I have rolled the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit.\" He then did pass to the right. 4.The apostle Peter did accept and toke of this blessed joint, passing it on to his brother Andrew, who passed it on to James. From James it passed to John, and from John to Phillip. Phillip passed it to Bartholomew, who passed it to the apostle Chad. 5.It was now that the hazy silence was broken. Chad did toke of the Holy Spirit, though his face revealed his confusion. 6.And he did ask Jesus, \"J, how can that be? How can we be smoking the Son, when you are sitting right in front of me, bro?\" 7.Chad did pass the joint to the apostle Brad, who carried on; \"Ya bro, like, there is no way you could ever fit inside of a joint. I mean, you're a grown man. And especially after all that P90X we've been repping. You're looking swol, JC, am I right, boys?\" 8.The other apostles let out a WHOOP WHOOP; Brad did indeed receive an amen. 9.All, that is, except for Judas Iscariot, seated to the left of Jesus. He rubbed his own brow with thumb and forefinger for a moment, before glaring at the apostles Brad and Chad. 10.\"You fools!\" He declared, \"The Holy Spirit is not him physically! He is a man, made holy by his spirit, which comes from the Lord, his father!\" 11.Chad was taken aback. \"So my spirit comes from my father?\" Brad did question further, \"Maybe that's why your mom always says you haven't got any!\" 12.The apostle Brad did expose his knuckles to the apostle Thomas, and the knuckles of the hands of the two apostles did touch. 13.Brad the  turned to Jesus, \"JC, sick doobie, bro, but it's running a bit. Just let me-\" 14.Judas did cut him off. \"Pass the goddamn joint already! The Lord is your father! Your spirit comes from him!\" 15.Brad, now, was taken aback. \"The Lord is not my father, bro! Ephithius is my father. Ephithius Johnson. I look just like him and everything. And besides, my mom ain't like that, bro.\" 16.It was now that the apostle Chad appeared to have received a revelation from the Lord. \"So, like, if my spirit is holy then can I roll and smoke myself, too? J, you're gonna have to show me how to do that, bro! That is some next level shit!\" 17.Brad did struggle with demons. \"Maybe she is like that. I mean, I don't know. I mean, she did leave the house at night a lot. And Ephithius was never really around until I was like 13.\" 18.It was at this time that the joint did reach Judas; it was but little more than a roach. Judas did throw up his hands and exclaimed, \"Jesus Christ! Well, that's just great!\" He did stand, and like a departing storm he did depart from the room. 19.Bartholemew did call after him, \"Judas, thou art a cunt!\" at which Judas did raise his middle finger, not looking back. 20.\"J, bro, totally not your fault. That was super uncool of Judas. You rolled an awesome J, J, bro,\" the apostle Chad did console. Brad helped, \"Ya, bro. Wicked J. Stellar performance bro.\"",

            "comment": "It was said of Chad and Brad that these two were Jesus' favorite apostles, whereas the others tended to moon over his brilliance, those two could see the son that yearned to be free of his father's dogma. Yet despite their best efforts, Jesus was never able to escape his calling. \n\nOne day Chad and Brad decided to throw Jesus a surprise party and brought barrels of wine to a gathering, in order to get through strict security who didn't want people bringing their own booze they told the guard that the barrels contained water, since the guard assumed that they would not bear false witness, he let them through. When Jesus saw his friends he greeted them and promptly took a cup to show his appreciation for the gift. When everybody saw the wine they immediately heralded it as a miracle from Jesus. Brad and Chad were getting the stink eye from security and had no choice but to go along with it. That was strike one.\n\nStrike two was a beautiful Sunday, the Sabbath,  Chad and Brad thought it unwise to waste such a gorgeous day doing nothing so they brought Jesus to the beach to catch some waves. Their mistake however was giving Jesus a blue surfboard. Mixed in with the blue of the ocean the people once again thought they were seeing a miracle as it appeared that Jesus was walking on water. It was a very hot day so we can't judge them too much...\n\nThe last straw came after Jesus' death. Chad and Brad were devastated and when their friend was subsequently entombed, they thought it would be a great homage to the man they knew if they were to replicate one of his all-time favorite movies \"Weekend at Bernie's\". They removed Jesus from his tomb and through a crafty system of levers and strings, they brought him back to the world one final time. Everybody went mad, they completely fell for it and Chad and Brad were pleased with their work. They looked at each other and with tears in their eyes at the memory of the missing member of their trio they stilled managed to smile even though they knew God would never forgive them.",

            "comment": "Long regarded as the oldest of the four Gospels and the primary source of Matthew and Luke, the Gospel According to Mark is traditionally considered to be the work of a disciple of the Apostle Peter. In a recent find, biblical scholars have found a much older version of the book (circa 62 CE) that has caused quite a controversy. The book includes mention of two additional disciples that were removed in later redactions, as well as Peter's standing in Jesus' ministry (italics indicate removed text):\n\n\"And [Jesus] said, So is the Kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; *And Brad chortled, for he thought his lord spoke of a man actually fucking the ground. And Jesus and the thirteen laughed when they actually thought about it, all but for Peter, for 'he had a stick up his end' that not even his master could cure.*\"\n\nAnd [Jesus] called unto him the *fourteen* and began to send them forth by two and two...And they went out, and preached that men should repent. *And Brad and Chad, remembering their fraternity days, created a rush week, preaching repentance to hundreds through killer parties of wine, tailgaiting, and fraternity-sorority mixers. And all were pleased, until Peter, in whose home the Psi Phi brothers had hosted their 'ministry,' returned; and his anger waxed hot against the brothers, as there was no more of his wine, nor his food, his home a mess, and a guy named Jerry who refused to leave Peter's sofa from then on.\"*\n\n\"And Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew tables of the moneychangers. *And Chad and Brad joined him, until they overturned the table belonging to a Jeffe the Bearded, who was feared throughout Jerusalem. And upon returning to see his table overturned, Jeffe and his men approached the disciples, saying, Who is he that overturns my table? And they all pointed to Peter, for he was the suckup who demanded to be in charge of the disciples in absence of Jesus. So Peter paid their fine, and demanded repayment for this and his house, to which the brothers agreed to do when the kingdom of God had come, which was 'certain to be soon(ish).'*\"\n\nAnd they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he said to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray. And he taketh with him Peter, and James and John *and Brad and Chad*...And [Jesus] cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, why sleepest though? *And what in my name is on your forehead? And Peter wiped his brow, and behold, it was a dickbutt. And James and John and Brad and Chad and Jesus laughed, until Peter's anger boiled over. For I had had it up to here with those two slackers' bullshit, and I swear I will go to my grave before I let myself be overshadowed like this again by some upstart apostles.\"*\n\nTraditionalists are holding that these findings are a fraudulent attack on Peter's character and the Gospel of Mark as his sock puppet. However, others theorize this could explain Paul's \"colorful\" description of Peter as \"dickbutt\" redacted out of the account of the two's conflict in Galatians.",

            "comment": "\"Stand down, villain!\"\n\nThe battlecry broke off with a shrill note as Peacekeeper hobbled into the bank, wheezing at the effort he'd expended getting up the stairs. He paused to catch his breath at the door and leaned heavily upon the frame. Peacekeeper was clad in his signature blue and red unitard, unfortunately worn backwards, so his cape formed a sad looking bib.\n\nBlood Harpy, legendary villain and thief, was choking a security guard with one hand. With the other, she was rubbing her forehead in an attempt to remove the headache that had begun to build at Peacekeeper's entrance.\n\n\"George, you can't keep doing this, you know the excitement isn't good for your heart.\"\n\n\"And you-\" Peacekeeper coughed violently, then spoke amid heavy gasps. \"Can't. Keep. Robbing. Banks.\" With that, Peacekeeper slumped to the ground.\n\nHarpy's reaction was instant. She dropped the guard (who let out a heavy gasp) and sprinted towards the downed hero. Harpy checked for a pulse before putting her ear to the hero's chest.\n\n\"Stop fussing,\" muttered Peacekeeper, his breath shallow. \"Just need to take my medication. It's in my front pocket, can't seem to find it though...\"\n\nHarpy reached behind the elderly hero and produced a small brown bottle. Upon consuming a couple of pills, Peacekeeper's breathing returned to normal and Harpy's concern began to fade, just enough for her to get angry.\n\n\"I can't believe they let you through the cordon!\" she said. \"What the hell were they thinking! You're what, 80 now? You can barely get up the damned stairs!\"\n\n\"87\" replied Peacekeeper, \"and still young enough to teach you a lesson.\" \n\n\"Tough talk\" scoffed Harpy. \"For a hero who can't even keep track of his heart medication.\"\n\nPeacekeeper sighed, then spoke in a low voice. \"Listen Jess, I like one-liners as much as the next hero, but I've known you long enough to sense when something's wrong. You've been clean for years, and all of a sudden I hear that you're lifting from a bank? You're lashing out.\"\n\nBlood Harpy averted her gaze, and in doing so took in the scene around her. Trembling tellers, pale patrons and unconscious guards littered the bank. For the first time since her arrival, she realised that she was causing a scene. Harpy helped Peacekeeper to his feet, supported him with an arm, then turned to address her captive audience.\n\n\"Good news terrified mob, looks like you all get to live. Let it be known that I've captured the Peacekeeper and will execute him if I hear a single pig's trotter touch the floor of this bank. Now get the fuck out of my sight.\"\n\nAs unsure civilians fled out their respective closest exits, Blood Harpy and The Peacekeeper made their way to the back of the bank. Harpy picked a secluded office, settled the elderly hero in one of the seats and closed all the blinds. George waited patiently for Harpy to seat herself before speaking.\n\n\"So are you going to tell me what this is all about?\" he asked.\n\nHarpy thought about killing her nemesis there and then, it would be so much easier than the alternative. He'd been a thorn in her side for decades, always in the foreground, always putting a wrench in her plans, always in that damned unitard. Always there.\n\nJess let out a heavy sigh, and wrung her hands together.\n\n\"Sarah's dead,\" she whispered.\n\n\n*to be continued?*\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the support, you've made my day.

                    "comment": "Part 2:\n\n\"Ah.\" said George slowly. \"You two made quite the team.\"\n\nJess couldn't trust herself to speak, so she nodded.\n\n\"Do you remember Stuttgart?\" said George. \"Diamond as big as your fist. Kooee, that old curator was spitting tacks for weeks, I didn't think he'd ever calm down.\"\n\nDespite herself, Jess laughed, then choked back the tears that followed. \"We used it as a door stop,\" she said.\n\nNow it was George's turn to laugh, but his laughter ran short and his expression turned sour. \n\n\"It wasn't the league, was it?\" he said with grave seriousness.\n\n\"Them?\" Jess said the word with disgust. \"God no, even they're not stupid enough to take down a geriatric supervillain.\" Jess paused, and thought. She could still walk out, she didn't need to open up to this shrivelled up super hero. But he just sat there, his stupid cape sprawled out in front of him, he was no threat to anyone, least of all her.\n\n\"It was cancer,\" she said. \"We tried chemo, but Sarah...\" she choked.\n\nGeorge nodded with understanding. \"It must be a terrible curse to watch others grow old. I'm so sorry for your loss.\"\n\nDespite herself, this made Blood Harpy exquisitely angry. \"*What could you possibly know about-*\"\n\nShe stopped mid-sentence, her daggers turned to dust. There was a sadness in George's eyes that belied sympathy. He knew this pain too. Jess let out a deep sigh before continuing.\n\n\"You're right, it is a curse. That's why I became a villain. I *thought* that it would be a good way to keep people out, to be left alone.\"\n\nGeorge nodded once more. \"And then you met Sarah.\"\n\nJess shook her head. \"No, then Sarah met me. She was always the outgoing one. She suggested we team up for a few heists and split the loot. She suggested we \"combine our lairs,\" for \"safety in numbers.\" She knew exactly what she wanted and exactly how to get it. I would've kept to myself if not for her. God, you know what the most screwed up part of this is?\"\n\nGeorge said nothing.\n\n\"Apart from Sarah, you're the only person I've formed a relationship with in 40 years. I'm baring my heart and soul to a man who wants me dead.\"\n\nGeorge could not have been more surprised.\n\n\"DEAD? Heavens no. I like to think we had a relationship too, or at least a degree of professional courtesy towards one another. That's what the so-called heroes of today don't understand, they're too busy beating each other's brains out to see past the masks. Good grief, I don't even have any super powers -not that the city of Stalwart will believe me- but if you really wanted me dead I wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nHarpy smiled. \"I know. And if you'd really wanted to hurt me you knew exactly which nerve to cut... Thank you for not going there, by the way.\"\n\nGeorge waved it away as though it were nothing, and the two sat in silence, their thoughts lost in memory. It was Harpy who spoke first.\n\n\"I suppose you'll be wanting me to turn myself over to the police, repent for my crimes, 'in the name of retribution.'\"\n\nGeorge chuckled.\n\n\"All the *other* heroes mock me for that line. No, I'm too old for that now. As far as I'm concerned you've not stolen anything, and no one's dead. You've caused less of a fuss than if you'd asked to speak to the manager.\"\n\nJess smiled.\n\n\"Course they're not just going to let you through the cordon,\" George continued, with a sly edge to his voice. \"Not without a hostage, anyway.\"\n\nJess's grin grew broader.\n\n\"Then submit, old man, and I'll spare you the humiliation of a painful death.\"\n\nGeorge held up his arm for Jess to support.\n\n\"It would be my pleasure,\" he said.",

            "comment": "\"It's just not the same,\" Ultraman continued, from where he was sitting in an armchair. \"Everyone is so distracted by their phones and their electronics and their doohickeys. Now, back in my day-\"\n\n\"Rime!\" yelled out a voice from the hallway. \n\nRime, Bringer of Frost, Mistress of Winter, and current President of the Federal Confederation of Villainy, let out an exasperated huff. A hero? On a Wednesday afternoon? \n\nShe snapped her fingers.\n\n\"I'm here to- *urp!*\"\n\nUltraman paused in his story. \"Did you say something, Rime?\"\n\nRime gave him an apologetic smile. \"It wasn't me. I think it's from outside. I'll just pop out to see what it is, won't be a moment.\"\n\nShe stepped out of the study and shut the door behind her gently before leaning back on it, taking a deep breath. She could feel the familiar weight of her mask clipped to her belt. It was designed to cover her whole face with dark, jagged crystals, all harsh lines and sharp edges, black ice as twisted and as dangerous as she was supposed to be. She put it on.\n\nRime briskly made her way to the hero she'd flash frozen in a cube of ice in her hallway. She couldn't\u200b quite make out the mask underneath the murky surface, but the costume was gaudy, the colors garish. She couldn't help but sigh. An amateur, but that was only to be expected - the veterans in the United League of Heroes knew better than to disturb her on Wednesdays.\n\nShe snapped her fingers. \n\nThe cube melted in an instant, freezing water gushing across the floor, draining quietly through the numerous storm drains she'd had installed. \n\nThe hero inside it coughed, a series of violent, hacking sounds, and Rime felt her lips curl into a sneer. She'd only frozen the hero for a minute at best. Newbies nowadays...\n\n\"Rime!\" the hero called - well, wheezed. \"I'm here to-\"\n\n\"Your name?\" Rime said. \n\n\"Stop you- huh?\" the hero faltered. This close, their voice was young, high pitched, still slightly squeaky. \"My... what?\"\n\n\"Your. Name.\" Rime said, enunciating the words clearly. She gestured at the hero's bedraggled costume.\n\nThe hero blinked up at her. \"I'm- I'm Phoenix.\"\n\nRime rolled her eyes. Seriously? \"Let me guess. You had some sort of traumatic incident in your life most likely due to a supervillain, a superhero saved you, and since then your lifelong dream was to become a superhero just like them?\"\n\nPhoenix stared at her, mouth slightly open, as though halfway through objecting but not sure to what.\n\nRime waited a moment. It was only polite.\n\nWhen no response was forthcoming, she continued. \"Let's see if I'm on a lucky streak. Lo and behold, you're one of the lucky few that get usable powers, you realize you have a knack for fire, and you have the brilliant idea to come here to try to get rid of me once and for all because I'm the President of the Confederation and hence must be the worst villain around, and fire, after all, completely negates ice? Or so you'd think, at least?\"\n\n\"Uh.\" said Phoenix.\n\n\"Did you listen at all during class? They teach you this on the first week.\"\n\nThe blush was a dead giveaway.\n\nRime sighed. \"Oh, dear. You went off to find me the moment you got your powers, didn't you? Did you have the costume ready made?\"\n\nIt was disappointing. The quality of fledgling heroes kept dropping with every passing year. There were just too many heroes convinced they were experts on fighting crime after reading a how-to guide on the internet.\n\n\"So, Phoenix,\" Rime continued. \"Usually, as retribution, I'd freeze you in a block of ice and keep you that way until the League realized you're missing, but my afternoon is already fully booked. I need to deal with Ultraman's latest attempt to foil my plans. Do feel free to come back around tomorrow if you fancy being frozen again.\"\n\n\"Ultraman?!\" Phoenix exclaimed, suddenly talkative once more. \"He's like... old, and washed up, and senile! He's not even part of the League anymore!\"\n\nRime had to restrain herself from freezing Phoenix - oh, but how she hated that name - right then and there. \"He's also been fighting crime for more than fifty years,\" she said coldly, \"Which you would know if you actually went to class. And when the League decided he wasn't useful to them anymore, they discharged him without so much as a pension or even a thank you. Fifty years and it meant nothing to them. The League isn't government funded. It runs for profit, and at the end of the day, it cares about money. The League didn't much fancy taking care of an elderly, senile hero... so it let him go.\"\n\nPhoenix gaped at her. It only lasted for a moment. \"The League would never do something like that!\"\n\n\"Ask the League where Ultraman's pension is,\" Rime said. \"Or Wonderlady's, or Crowstorm's, or any of the older heroes for that matter. The League doesn't care. But we at the Confederation remember, and we at the Confederation care - we have a caretaker rotation. The enemy of my enemy and all that, as they say, because the League most certainly hasn't been friendly in its dealings with its older heroes. One might even say it's been quite villainous.\"\n\n\"You're lying!\" Phoenix cried out. \"The League wouldn't do that, and you're just saying it because you're, you're a villain! And evil!\"\n\nRime had lost what little patience she had left for that conversation. \"If that helps you sleep at night, then by all means keep telling yourself that. Just remember to ask yourself why none of the League veterans ever come to challenge me on a Wednesday. Now get out of my lair before I decide I do actually have enough time to freeze you.\"\n\nA wave of her hand sent a barricade of ice slamming up from the floor, a wall of jagged frost that blocked Phoenix from her sight. \n\nRime stepped back into the study a few minutes later. \"Sorry, Ultraman. That took a little longer than I expected...\" she trailed off, finding Ultraman asleep in his armchair.\n\n\"Huh?\" Ultraman grunted, rousing himself. \"Whassat?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Rime said. \"Sorry for waking you.\"\n\n\"You younglings nowadays, and your nothing.\" Ultraman grumbled. \"It's always nothing with you. Back in my day, we didn't sit around doing nothing, we found ourselves something to do.\"\n\nRime smiled, turning away to hide it. \"I'm sure you did,\" she said. \"I'm sure you did.\"\n\n\"You kids nowadays have it so easy, sitting around all day. Back then, being a hero meant work! We had pride, a real pride in what we did, and...\"",

It has a really good balance of emotion and the length suits it perfectly. \n&gt; you're, you're a villain! \n\nYou might want to try use a '-' instead of a comma for this. So it goes, \"The League wouldn't do that! You're just saying it because you're- you're a villain! And evil!\". If you really wanted to show the conflict in Phoenix you could add an action beat or describe his face twisting up between \"The league wouldn't do that!\" and \"You're just saying...\"\n\nLast bit of feedback, if you were interested in turning this into something bigger I'd definitely consider developing the last few lines of dialogue a bit better (and, consequently, developing Ultraman's character a bit more). I feel like you've just gone for old people stereotypes (fitting for such a short response) but it doesn't make for a compelling character. Toning down his senility (\"back in my day\") and playing up how he just wants to talk would go a long way toward his character depth for me (I also wasn't really sure on his age, so I kind of assumed he was late 60's early 70's, not in his 80's).",

            "comment": "Captain Kaiser flies low, buzzing the tops of residential buildings. Looking again at the gadget his daughter gave him, he harumphed. In his heyday he could have found his way to the altercation by sound alone, but even superhearing goes with age, and now at eighty five.  he could only hear about as well as your average twenty year old. \n\nHis flying too had wakened with age, but that hardly mattered. Flight was flight, he told himself. If he could get to the scene of a crime in progress while beating the traffic, he was still ahead of the cops, ahead of the game. \n\nAnd besides, he was still stronger and faster than a base human, and many powered villains. The youngsters these days were nothing to worry about, not like the villains of old. But there were a few who were a danger. Those like...\n\n*Scheisse*, the Captain thought. One of the few who was a threat these days. The dreaded Austr\u014d!\n\nCK landed in a scene of chaos. The yard was huge, and the house, mansion really, was even more impressive. Scattered and running in singles and groups were people wearing swim and lounge wear, and it seemed all were wearing high price jewelry as well. \n\n*Stealing shiny rocks from the well-to-do*, CK thought. *This isn't her usual pattern. Is it? Maybe... she's the one who usually tries to shake up the government right? Or was that Freyja? Where'd she get that name I wonder. Maybe it it could be a clue to her secret identify. Could it be a... What are those things called when you jumbled the letters and get a new word? Lisa would know I bet, my brilliant little professor. I should call her. When was the last time we spoke? At Mary's funeral? No, couldn't be. She wouldn't ignore her father so long.*\n\nCK stood in the midst of the trapped human stampede, lost in his disconnected thoughts. Austr\u014d made her way slowly through the crowd, grabbing people at random, stripping them of their highend jewelry and shoving it into a satchel she was wearing. The brown leather bag didn't quite match the Saxon warrior maiden costume she wore, but some times function must won over form.\n\nThe sky suddenly split with a mighty *crackoom*, and three strangely dressed people decedent from the clouds unto the scene. The ruckus was enough to bring the captain back to the world, but he briefly forgot where he was or why he was there. When it came to him, his anger rose.\n\n\"Now see here!\" CK advanced on the newcomers wagging a finger at them. \"The League has no business stepping in and sending people to things I already have covered. This is an insult to my  standing as a board member.\"\n\nOne of the trio, a muscle bound young blonde man wearing little more than bearskin underwear turned to the captain. The hint of a sneer played about his face. \"You aren't a board member anymore, Mr. Kaiser.\"\n\n\"That's CAPTAIN Kaiser to you, sonny!\" the elderly hero extended himself to his full height, and felt a twinge in his back. He fought to hide the pain and to keep himself ramrod straight before the indignant youth. Even so he barely came up to the nearly-naked man's Adam's apple. \n\n\"Fine, Captain. Whatever. The fact is you are no longer in the League and have no business doing hero work. Further, if you are so capable, why is it this scene was here for us to arrive to?\"He gestured about himself.\"\n\nAustr\u014d stood watching the encounter since the mighty boom crashed down from the sky to reverberate off the mansion walls. Now, growing bored, she stepped forth. \"Ahem. I presume you four are from the League?\" \n\nCK responded by trying to shout \"I was here first\", but the walking bicep in animal cloth was louder.  \"Three. the three of us are from the League. This geezer has nothing to do with us. Pay him no mind.\" \n\nAustr\u014d grinned. \"I don't think  I should pay any of you any mind.\" She turned and grabbed the nearest base human, ripped an emerald necklace from her throat. \n\nThe ensuing altercation was over nearly before it began. CK could barely follow it as the League trio bolted at Austr\u014d. She laid them all out in a matter of seconds, then turned to face him, poised for combat. \n\n\"These three couldn't stop me. Do the smart thing and walk away, old man.\" \n\nCaptain Kaiser, snapped to attention, clicked his heels together twice and saluted. \"You fought those three well young miss. But you will find the Kaiser a worthier foe!\" \n\nThe captain ran forward suddenly and swung hard. Austr\u014d had just enough time to parry the blow and strike out with her own left hook as a counter. CK deflected the shot with his elbow and lashed out again. \n\nFor over half an hour the two swung, parried, and grappled with each other. The Captain landed few hits, but allowed even fewer to strike himself. Finally, he managed to get Austr\u014d into a submission lock. \"Give in now and I promise the League will take it into consideration when picking out your confinement cell.\" \n\nWith sudden and astonishing strength, Austr\u014d broke from the lock. \"Damn you\" Was all she had to say before gaining a running leap, and flying off to the south. The League trio were just coming to. The satchel full of precious stone and metals had fallen to the ground in the struggle, and the contents given back to their rightful owners. \n\n...\n\nCaptain Kaiser, more commonly called Hans in his secret daily life, sat in his rocking chair on the porch and waited for his daughter, Lisa, to arrive. She came from inside a few moment later carrying two lemonades. Hans looked at her with confusion a moment before recalling that she'd been with him over an hour, and had only stepped away to get them drinks. \"Thank you my little spring dawn.\" That had been his pet name for his daughter since she was born with the sunrise one beautiful May morning. \n\n\"My pleasure, dad.\" She kissed his cheek and sat on the porch railing next to him. \"I saw in the news you almost bagged Austr\u014d. And after she took out three young League heros.\" She shook her head. \"Serves them right after how they kicked you out. And with no pension either. I'm glad the university was kind enough to put you up for life in thanks for saving the place from The Flaming Khan. Save their necks once forty years ago and they have more respect than the League. You helped found the League for goodness sake and they just kick you out and...\n\n\"Now, now. They did what they had to do.\" Hans frowned and suddenly looked his age. \"We both know my body and my power aren't the only things starting to go, little dawn. Before the fight with Austr\u014d... I ha forgotten altogether that I wasn't a board member in the League anymore. And I have to use that Geepass thing just to find where crime is happening these days.\" He put his face into his hands and began to weep. \"I just wanted to prove I could still do it. That with your mother gone I still have a purpose.\"\n\nLisa slipped off the railed and wrapped her arms around her father. \"Come on dad, don't think like that. You saved the day, remember. Austr\u014d kicked those League cronies behinds and you managed to fight her on your own and win! You can still hack it with the best of them!\" \n\nShe picked up the GPS that her father used to find his way to crime scenes and pushed it into his hands. \"You may not be everything you used to, but the people still need you.\" She hugged him again. \"And I still need you.\" \n\nHans smiled at his daughter as she wiped away the tears from his lined faced. \"Thank you my little spring dawn. I don't know how I'd manage without you.\" \n\n...\n\n\"How's he doing?\"\n\nLisa's husband, Jeff, had always been fond of Hans. Even so, he had found it hard to face the old hero's deteriorating health, and so rarely went with his wife to see him. All he could do was ask her how the aging man was doing. \n\n\"He's still slipping away, slowly. We exercised the other day though and I think it did him some good. I am going to do it a couple times a week for a while and see how things go. But I'm hopeful.\"\n\nJeff smiled sadly. \"Me too. I'm sorry I can't stay for dinner, have to go back to work. We have a conference call with Japan in an hour.\" Jeff threw a few more things into a backpack and zipped it shut. \"Can't believe I am using this thing to go into work.\" Jeff looked over to his wife. \"You haven't seen my satchel anywhere have you? The brown leather one?\"\n\n\"...Uhh, no. Sorry dear.\" Lisa smiled sweetly. ",

Can't afford to get written up on any more of them charges.\"\n\n\"There's no crime if it's for a good purpose,\" said Vorlax, who as No. 42 on the League's most wanted list, really was the last person anyone should be taking legal advice from. \"Besides, I'm the one with the dummy explosives here, so Chronotron's going to be focusing fully on me. You ready?\" \n\nThe two supervillains took a deep breath, then pushed their way to the centre of the crowded town square. Vorlax hopped onto a bench, threw open his trenchcoat, revealing a neat array of sausages, tightly wrapped in brown paper. The alarm clock which Kaaboom had helped tape to the front dangled precariously. \n\n\"Screw all of you! Damn you all to hell! See ya all in the afterlife, muthaf-\"\n\nVorlax never got to finish his threat. Even before the gathered crowd could react, even before the first screams could rend the air, he had already frozen in place, encased in a shimmering cage of writhing chrono-filaments.\n\nHot damn, thought Kaaboom, so this is what it looks like from the outside. \n\nEnthused clapping rang out as the citizenry acknowledged yet another successful rescue by the hero known as Chronotron, the League's newest poster boy. He hovered in the air, waving at his adoring fans. \n\n\"Fear not, one and all, the threat has been neutralised! It's off to the gallows for this one!\"\n\n\"Wait, wait!\" shouted Kaaboom, remembering the part he had to play. They had flipped a coin for this, because it was never fun to have to explain to the League what they were really up to, plus it wasn't easy suppressing the instinct to run, an instinct they had honed their entire careers. \"Wait, Chronotron! I can explain everything!\" \n\nThe darkening scowl from Chronotron made it clear to Kaaboom that he had only a very short window of opportunity. \n\n\"Kaaboom? You caught up in this terrorist attack too?\"\n\n\"No, no! Wait, I mean yes! But not in that way, those aren't explosives at all, I swear! Just sausages! From the deli opposite!\"\n\nChronotron stretched a hand into the chronocage, poking tentatively. His scowl deepened as his finger pierced into the soft mushiness of a bratwurst. \n\n\"If this is a joke, Kaaboom, it is in bad taste. Causing undue public alarm is also a crime!\"\n\n\"We needed to get to you urgently, that's all! And the League wouldn't take any of our calls, our numbers are all blacklisted! Please, just a minute of your time, in private!\"\n\nChronotron snapped his fingers, and a larger chronocage extended to envelop the two of them. Outside the bubble, the world ground to a halt. \n\n\"55 seconds remain, Kaaboom, before I'm hauling both you and Vorlax in.\"\n\n\"Right, right! See, we think something's happened to Vortex Man, and just in case he needs help urgently, we thought, you know, your powers would come in handy! I swear, that's the truth!\" \n\nA puzzled frown spread across Chronotron's face. \"Vortex Man? Why would anything happen to him? He's been retired for years!\"\n\n\"Well, see... There's this roster we have, all the ones who have been given second chances by him before. We take turns to check in on him, just to make sure the old boy's getting on well...\"\n\n\"How would you know where he lives anyway? His identity's still a secret!\"\n\nKaaboom thrust a sheaf of papers at Chronotron, and said, \"We don't, but look, we know his routine, where he goes for his daily walk, where he gets his coffee... And we take turns staging kidnappings, or hold ups, just so that he has a bit of exercise, you know? We think it keeps him happy, being relevant and appreciated and all...\"\n\nThe first time he had been asked to assist, Kaaboom had drawn the short straw, so the role of a desperate mugger went to him. He had come away from the encounter shaken, not so much because Vortex Man still packed a mean punch, but because he had truly aged, now a mere shadow of the strapping superhero who had first apprehended Kaaboom on the streets so many years ago.\n\nThe sheen to Vortex Man's once thick, lustrous hair was gone, and a certain pallidness clung to his skin like shame to an introvert. His mind too, frail and feeble, couldn't recognise Kaaboom even though he played a kidnapper, then a rapist, then a mugger again, three days in a row. \n\nHeck, Kaaboom even had to pretend to be a cat in a tree once, after Vorlax suggested that variety would help keep Vortex Man nimble.\n\nKaaboom didn't mind helping out more, especially after the other supervillains started excusing themselves from the roster, citing the poor economy, the need to find work in other cities, family commitments... there were fewer and fewer of them on the roster, which meant that some weeks, Kaaboom and Vorlax did double, triple duties.\n\nAfter all, the way that Vortex Man brightened up every time he helped someone... that was enough for Kaaboom to want to come back again, the very next day.\n\nChronotron flipped through the papers, understanding slowly dawning on him. \"And I take it, he hasn't turned up today?\" \n\n\"Yes, you get it now! Nothing! We've been on Evil.net, and no one else has seen or heard from him in two days! So we thought, he's been pretty regular with his schedule, and for him to suddenly not turn up...\"\n\nIf there was one thing Kaaboom had to give Chronotron credit for, it was that he truly had the gumption and decisiveness of a first-class hero. Chronotron handed back the papers, raised both arms in the sky, and shouted as the chronocage grew, slowly at first, then faster, and larger, till it stretched further than the eye could see. \n\nNow, nothing moved, except for the two of them. \n\n\"Come, then, let's go. I have a rough idea of where he stays. If there is any medical emergency, this should buy us some time till we can get help to him.\"\n\n\"Err... Chronotron, if you don't mind, could we get Vorlax to come too? This was his idea after all...\"\n\nChronotron laughed, then inclined his head ever so slightly. \n\n\"... uckas!\"\n\n---\n\n/r/rarelyfunny \n\n---\n\n[PART II](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/65458n/wp_a_senile_old_superhero_still_goes_out_to_fight/dg7qhtx/) is up!

                    "comment": "There was a certain serenity which permeated the city, now that it was out of step with time, suspended like bubbles in ice, alive but not quite living. Kaaboom couldn\u2019t help but pause every couple of steps to admire the handicraft of nature, the fine, delicate details which were usually lost in the great flurry of activity that defined the city.\n\nA hot-dog wrapper, curling in the wind. A gutter rat poised to spring, eyes fixed on a stray morsel. A fully turgid, vibrating middle-finger, leading back to his grumpy, impatient brother-in-arms, Vorlax.\n\n\u201cNo, please, Kaaboom. Please take your time to inspect every little thing which crosses our path. Oh, is that a leaf I see there? No way\u2026 a *fluttering* leaf? Post-haste, my friend, let\u2019s check it out, I\u2019m sure Chronotron doesn\u2019t mind waiting for you at all!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s alright,\u201d laughed Chronotron, good-naturedly. \u201cI\u2019m used to people doing that. They tell me it\u2019s like a scene right out from some old classic movie, back in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nThe unlikely trio turned the corner, and the neighbourhood park loomed ahead. Vorlax glanced down at the poorly-photocopied map passed to him when he had first volunteered to join the roster, and said, \u201cYeap, we\u2019re here. This is where we usually part ways with Vortex Man. Sometimes he forgets, and invites us over for a cup of tea, but we usually decline.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? You guys feel uncomfortable getting so close to someone who\u2019s arrested you before?\u201d\n\n\u201cPartly,\u201d Kaaboom said, piping up from the back. \u201cMostly though, it\u2019s because we have to go check on whoever\u2019s designated as the bad guy that day. Vortex Man always says that he\u2019ll get home then call for the League to round us up, give us medical attention, but er, he frequently forgets.\u201d\n\nKaaboom knew first-hand the fraility of Vortex Man\u2019s memory. Once, after Vortex Man had subdued him and left him trussed up next to a tree in the park, Vortex Man had simply forgotten to follow through on his promise to summon the League for assistance, opting instead to return to his original program of strolling in the park. It had poured shortly after, which also meant that no one had noticed Kaaboom soaking in the rain for the next few hours.\n\nKaaboom and Vorlax had come up with a buddy system shortly after.\n\n\u201cWhat made you guys decide to keep tabs on Vortex Man anyway?\u201d asked Chronotron, as he ambled down the street, peering at the nameplates next to the entrances of the apartment buildings. \n\nVorlax responded first, and Kaaboom was glad for that \u2013 Vorlax had always been the one who was sharper, better with words. \u201cWell, Chronotron, you ever get cut off in traffic while you\u2019re driving, and you think to yourself, \u2018You bastard, if there\u2019s a fire I\u2019m saving you last\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not really. But if you\u2019re asking whether I ever think bad thoughts about others, then yes, I guess, sometimes. I\u2019m only human.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same for us, then, eh? We may be supervillains, but there are times we look at others, and we kind of want to do something nice for them too. We\u2019re not so different, Chronotron, life just took us down different paths.\u201d\n\nA certain hard-edged spite had entered Vorlax\u2019s voice, and Kaaboom thought he understood why. It was tiring to always have the world look at you a certain way, judge your actions before you were even done doing them. Chronotron wouldn\u2019t have understood if he tried \u2013 he came from a different world, where lines were always clear, and people were always worth saving.\n\nIt was different in their world. The way Vorlax told it, no one had ever actually told him that his powers were meant to be used for good, not evil. Powers were just\u2026 tools, a means to help him get what life had denied him from the start. Those who could sing got famous, those who were shrewd got rich, so why couldn\u2019t the empowered get what they wanted to? And so when Vorlax came into his heritage, discovered his ability to shapeshift, he simply proceeded to take from the world what was rightfully his.\n\nVortex Man had been different. The other superheroes, they were caught up with efficiency, putting as many supervillains behind bars as quickly as possible. It was always *wham, bam, in the lam* for them. Vorlax never revealed what exactly Vortex Man said to him the night the two duelled and the forces of good prevailed, but Kaaboom had an idea.\n\nAfter all, he too had been in the same position, vanquished and bloodied, body wracked with pain, when Vortex Man had extended a hand, open-palmed. Vortex Man had pulled him up, righted him, made him return the monies he had stolen, then bought him a mug of beer to take the edge off the headache.\n\nToo much time had passed for Kaaboom to remember what exactly Vortex Man had said that night, huddled as they were in a corner of the bar, but it was something along the lines of, \u201cSon, you can be so much more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is it,\u201d said Chronotron, stopping in his tracks, as his finger trailed the nameplates of a building near the end of the street. \u201cI think I recognise this name. Ready?\u201d\n\nThe three of them started up the stairs, given that the elevators couldn\u2019t work while Chronotron\u2019s powers were activated. Kaaboom kept closely behind Vorlax, and they worked hard at keeping pace with Chronotron, who seemed overeager to sprint upwards.\n\nThey turned a corner, and realised they were lagging behind. Chronotron was already a couple of steps ahead, hand on the doorknob, letting himself into the small, humble apartment. The plaques and trophies which adorned the surface of the kitchen counter confirmed that this was Vortex Man\u2019s abode.\n\nKaaboom braced himself for the worst, but a quick search soon revealed that there was no unpleasant discovery waiting for them. Instead, the only item which seemed out of place was a letter on the table, written in halting script. Chronotron scanned through it, then passed it to Vorlax, who devoured it as quickly. \n\n\u201cWell, Vorlax, what\u2019s it say? Come on, don\u2019t make me read it, I\u2019m not good with letters.\u201d\n\nVorlax sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s gone, Kaaboom. He ain\u2019t returning.\u201d\n\n---\n\nKaaboom and Vorlax sat on the bench in the park. Nature was in full swing again, birdsong trilling, fountains splashing, noisy kids screaming as they chased each other endlessly. The sun hung low, scattering its rays through the thick foliage.\n\nKaaboom briefly wondered if he would ever see the world through Chronotron\u2019s eyes again. The afternoon had bonded them, and he had invited the superhero to join them for a bit, but Chronotron had declined, citing urgent business at the League Headquarters. On some level, he already missed the good-natured beast of a superhero.\n\n\u201cI hope Vortex Man really enjoys the Bahamas,\u201d said Kaaboom, idly plucking the petals off a flower, the most villainous act he had committed that afternoon. \u201cHe deserves every bit of his retirement there.\u201d\n\nVorlax was silent, staring at the skies. Kaaboom spoke again, louder this time, in case Vorlax didn\u2019t hear him.\n\n\u201cI said, I hope Vortex Man really enj-\u201d\n\n\u201cDammit, Kaaboom! How dumb can you get! Vortex Man didn\u2019t retire to the Bahamas, he\u2019s dead!\u201d \n\nThe petals fell from Kaaboom\u2019s hand. The children, startled by Vorlax\u2019s outburst, and his momentary shapeshift into a starfish, the saddest creature he knew, ran off. The tears had begun to streak down Vorlax\u2019s cheeks.\n\n\u201cDe\u2026 dead? But the letter, it said\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe letter was a fake, you idiot! I should have seen it then, but it only just occurred to me\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Vorlax. You know I\u2019m not as smart as you. What do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remember when we got to the floor?\u201d said Vorlax, straining with the effort of remaining civil, \u201cwhen we thought Chronotron had suddenly sped up in front of us? That wasn\u2019t it. The bastard had trapped us again in another chronocage, just before we turned the corner. He was in the apartment before us! He must have found Vortex Man alone, passed out or dead, then cleaned up so we wouldn\u2019t see! He knew Vortex Man wasn\u2019t just a superhero, he was *our* superhero\u2026\u201d\n\nA headache blindsided Kaaboom, and fumes began to pour out from his shirt, the surest sign of agitation for a pyromancer like him. \u201cHow did you know all that? Are you sure?\u201d\n\nVorlax sighed, pressing his hands to his face. \u201cThe clues were all there\u2026 Vortex Man\u2019s favourite sneakers were on the rack\u2026 there was an empty space in the living room where a recliner should have been\u2026 and when was the last time Vortex Man\u2019s eyesight was good enough to read, much less write a bloody letter?\u201d\n\nHis hand, trembling, pointed in the direction of the nearest police station, just on the other side of the park. The symbol of everything they did not stand for, the bastion of a world they would never know, spoke to them in the only way possible across the chasm of the gulf, sharing a common loss which afflicted them.\n\n\u201cAnd when was the last time you saw their flags flying at half-mast, eh?\u201d\n\n--- \n\n/r/rarelyfunny\n\n---\n\nThank you very much, /u/FinFihlman, /u/Krellous, /u/brookiebear17 and any others I may have missed out.

Your dialogue and timing (the \"-uckas!\" as Vorlax gets freed from the chrono-trap!) is excellent and gave hints as to what the characters might be like outside the story.\n\nChronotron's formal way of speaking hints that he might be one of those alien or robotic heroes - or that he's the kind who's basically Cosplaying For Real and he's having geeky fun putting on the superhero stereotypes. Kaaboom says \"them charges\" but also \"the deli opposite\" (instead of just 'across the street'), so I imagine he's a book-reading Southern guy, though he's your character and I could be wrong. Vorlax I don't know so much about, because I have no idea what his name means, but he looks the charging-into-things type. And Vortex Man isn't *directly* characterized, more hinted at by the way people interact with him, but he seems like someone I'd like, and I'm fonder of your approach than the top story's portrayal of Ultraman complaining about kids and their modern doohickeys. (Don't get me wrong, the Ultraman and Rime story is *awesome*, but I think yours is a little awesomer.)\n\nEDIT: Oh, and I like that it involves actual hero-villain battles too! Even if they're just doing it because that's the only way the heroes and villains can have an interaction, however friendly meant. And now I'm kinda sad ...",

I make sure the boys put up a little show but they know if they touch him they answer to me. \n\nMaximum Damage the last of the league of legends my fathers greatest advisory. They nearly killed each other countless times. My fathers powers of radiation manipulation and Max's unlimited strength meant they matched each other well.

By that stage I was running the show and dads powers were killing him. \n\nTowards the end I told my dad I'd take Max out for him as one last gotcha.  He said \"We don't kill family\". ",

The difference between himself and the villains was that he had no desires. He was sure if he did he would just take whatever he wanted because nobody could stop him. \n\nThe first time they called him a hero was when he stopped Nitrous from killing anymore people. He killed a family and was rampaging through the town.\n\nEvery time after that was the same stop nitrous from killing more people. None of the other heroes stood a chance against him so when they called he would turn up. \n\nHe had to put a stop to him finally when he nearly took out a school. Max didn't care too much for people who couldn't defend themselves but he never liked people to suffer especially children. \n\nHis sister had died protecting him. His powers hadn't manifested yet and she had thrown him with hers out of harms way. \n\nShe was a telepath and always knew what people needed.  Max found out later that she had wiped her killers memory be it a cruel joke or final act of kindness.  He missed her immensely and every day afterwards tried to repay his debt to her. \n\nHe knew his brother didn't mean it when he lost control and killed them all and he was grateful he didn't have to live with the knowledge he killed his family.  He was family what could Max do but try and protect him even from himself.  Max thought Nitrous remembered at least fragments of what he did and that lead him down the bad road.",

            "comment": "The people were screaming as the ran past the man, the only one that seemed to wade through the crowd toward the Chaos. It had been that way for years... decades, and god was he tired. Tired of it all, the same ole routine with the same ole villains. But he knew he had a duty to the city, and within that duty a certain pride made him swell out his chest and splash that famous boyish grin across his face that drove the ladies mad. Strutting toward the outward destruction, Guardian felt people brush past him, but he simply stayed the course until he came to the epicenter of madness. \n\nHe could see the woman floating there in a cocoon of lightning, her body accented by flashes of light and a form fitting suit that seemed to hug her in all  the right spots. His grin curved just a little more upwards as he felt her sparkling blue eyes turn on her and seem to grow wider at the sight of him. Guardian knew it was fear of who was there, the city's epitome of hero's. He was tall and muscular, filling out his suit like a glove of pure muscle, his perfectly quaffed brown hair almost always seemed to blow lightly in that mysterious breeze that seemed to surround all his dramatic entries... And that grin, those perfect teeth that could even make the woman villains weak in the knees when they first saw him. It was all he could do to keep them off of him after all...\n\n\"Lightning star! Come on now do we really have to do this? The whole song and dance is getting tiring isn't it? Why not just stop and lets talk about this... Maybe over dinner?\" He asked him, striking a little pose as he waited to see just what her response would be. \n\nUsually they said no, a fight ensued, and he would win between his seemingly nigh invulnerability and his super strength and speed. He was the hero everyone envied and every villain feared and he could see it was working. Lightning star was dropping out of the sky, the lightning storm that had ripped the court yard apart into chunks of stone debris that was finally settling back down to the ground. Trees uprooted, park fixtures throw around, it was chaos where he stood, facing the villain defiantly.\n\nLightning Star finally touched down to the ground, walking over to the Hero who stood there triumphantly and just sighed.\n\n\"Yea... Yea I guess we can call it a day... Off to Jail?\" She said somewhat dejectedly as Guardian just nodded and put a hand on her side, showing her the way...\n\nLightning Star could only groan as she saw the small man shamble through the crowd to face her. He just looked so... Sad... A once proud hero that had struck fear into anything that even thought about evil in this city was reduced to... this...\n\nHis trademark grin had become toothless and empty, the once famous hair had turned white and scarce... And his impressive stature had been reduced to a bent over shriveled man. Sure he was still invulnerable damn near, but everything else was just... gone. Now he was nothing more than a bag of bones and skin, a shell of the former hero and pride of the City.\n\nNo Guardian was gone, and in his stead was simply a man that was to far gone in his own mind with past glories that he would make him run headlong into the middle of a lightning storm with no real way of winning. Of course there was a certain sense of admiration to the man who was willing to still give up and sacrifice his body in such a man as to save a city, but she wasn't the only villain that seemed to cotter to the old man somewhat...\n\nNo it was that reason that found her walking along with the old man, that and many more reasons. Maybe admiration for what the man had been before, maybe a bit of nostalgia, or trying to have something in common with what the older villains had. No, it was probably beca-\n\n\"Stop right there Star! I wont let you get away with this! You're going away for good th... What are you doing old man?\" \n\nOh great, another rookie idiot. Sure she didn't have the same time under her belt as some of the greats of her generation, but that didn't mean she was a complete newbie. Even so, she figured everyone knew of Guardian, who he was and his current... Situation. Shaking her head she just shooed him off from behind Guardian's back. But the kid simply kept on, really irking Star now.\n\n\"Old man get out of here, what are you even doing out here? You're in the way!\" The no name said as he grabbed Guardian by the shoulder and seemed to shove him aside a little rougher then what was good for him. That irked Star to no end, a lack of respect for a front runner, even more so as the boy brushed past the downed Icon with little to no care. It made her blood boil, and with the punch of her fist, she shot out a bolt of destructive lightning straight for the boy's gut. \n\nA ragged bloodied hole of charred flesh and innards was all that was left of the man's midsection. Gasping noises like the sound of a goldfish sucking for air out of water painted the confusion perfectly across his face as he collapsed a few seconds later. There was no need for disrespect, especially not of this caliber for a man of this respect. He had done great things for hero's, helped get legislation passed that helped protect the rights of those that came after him. He had helped set up academies to train and nurture the future of his kind. And yet everywhere she looked, those that he had set a future for just brushed him aside...\n\nIt angered her to no end, along with quiet a few others in her circle, but for her it was personal. Guardian had been a idol for the woman as a young girl, and frankly who wouldn't look up to the top hero in the world, especially when it was your own dad...\n\n\"Come on Guardian, the other guy had other stuff to do. Another call I guess. You were going to take me in right?\"\n\nGuardian seemed lost for a moment before nodding.\n\n\"Ri-Right! Now come along little miss... You know you remind me of my daughter. Such a sweet little girl, Always wants to come along but I always told her it was to dangerous! Especially after what happened with her mother. Sad side effect of the job you understand I'm sure. \" He began to ramble on about her mother, tearing up old wounds. No, it wouldn't do to listen to this, but tonight... Tonight made her think. If the new crop wouldn't respect him, she would make them... \n\nMaybe it was time to take up the family business... \n\n(It's my first time writing one of these, please be kind! It was a blast though, I'm gonna start doing more of these for sure.)",

Neroman checked both ways before taking one, his wife would kill him if he broke his diet rule. Shade smiled watching this old man scarf down the gummies like an adolescent.\n\n\"It's okay I hope they understand it's part of the job some da- WAIT! No! No! No! We're talking about you young man now you have to promise!\" Neroman said his hands beginning to glow.\n\n\"Put those away Neroman I promise to TRY okay?\" Shade responded his hands up in surrender. They continued walking Neroman walked faster increasing his speed until he was in front of shade walking more dramatic as his towel turned cape blew in the wind. Neroman was escorting Shade to the local precinct after catching him in the dastardly act of J-walking. It must've been an odd sight Shade was easily taller than the old man, and with his reputation he could snap him in half with no effort. Shade's soulless eyes would usually be sucking the hope out of all around him his ethereal mass less shadow head floating on a disconnected cape. However, Shade didn't mind letting this old man and his makeshift cape escort his nightmarish form to a police station. \n\n\"Shade you dastardly, disgusting, deviant!\" A small man yelled from behind him.\n\n\"That can't be grammatically correct\" Shade spoke sarcastically the darkness in his hand returning, burning like the fires of hell ready to snap the upstarts neck. \n\n\"I am PlastoMan, and I-\" PlastoMan started before Neroman ran in front of Shade. \"I've got him fellow Hero don't worry I'll make sure he gets to the proper authorities\" Neroman stated proudly. \"Hero's never change always showing off\" Shade thought staring fondly at Neroman. \n\n\"Move Gramps let the real heroes fight crime okay?\" PlastoMan pushed Neroman. Neroman began to trip before he could touch the ground Shade had caught him helping him up. Plastoman's body had been flung into a near by building both legs shattered. Neroman looked up into Shade's eyes almost embarrassed and, Shade knew the walk was over.\n\n\"Oh thank you sir! Must've tripped, You must be one of those new heroes that I hear about!\" Neroman responded, his hero persona dropping out of him as his mind snapping to another personality almost instantly. The doctor had said something about this happening if Norman kept heroing about. Almost like his mind would shut off his hero persona if it felt his pride was being threatened, like a ego shield.\n\n\"No, Nero- I mean Yes, Norman I am\"  Shade hated moments like these. Norman would be here then gone in an instant, with no one knowing for how long. The old man seemingly lost in his own mind like a hamster in a maze. Cerberus had told him about this to take it easy on him and to cherish what was there. \n\n\"I have a son like you, you know? Costume like yours and everything except you know less menacing\" Norman said almost nervous-like. \n\n\"Yeah my old man has been telling me I should try warmer colors\" Shade responded. \n\n\"Good advice sounds like a swell guy, HAHAHA\" Norman laughed.\"...I hope he's doing okay though he doesn't come to see me. I don't blame him it'd break his heart, flaws of a hero right? Care way too much...\" Norman continued walking forward. Shade walking next to him listening silently. \n\n\"Can I bother you for the time young sir? I need to be at the hospital at 6:30 my wife was supposed to take me but, I think I walked off without her! HAHAHA\" Norman spoke chuckling. \"Come to think about it where am I going?\" Norman seemed confused looking around. \n\n\"We were going to Metropolitan on 6th, you asked me to walk you there\" Shade responded pulling out his arm from underneath the cloak checking his watch. \"..and you've got time it's 5:47\"\n\n\"I did? Oh, your right I did! Well I'm sorry my stories I must've gotten us lost\" Norman said drooping his head like a sad puppy. \n\n\"It's okay Norman looking at the signs we should only be a block or two away\" Shade spoke truthfully. Norman immediately perked up happy to know he hadn't wasted a strangers time. The two continued chatting, walking towards the hospital like comrades in arms. Turning the corner they saw a concerned looking woman, her pudgy round frame tucked into a pink sweater and mom jeans standing in front of the hospital. \n\n\"There's my firecracker she's gonna beat me silly HAHA!\" Norman laughed staring fondly at his wife. \"Norman?\" His wife responded almost tentatively turning to her husband. \"Of course, sugarbug who else looks this good in a towel?!\" Norman responded hugging her. His wife hugged him back tightly, happy that she wouldn't have to talk Neroman down and into the hospital. She stared at Shade standing off to the side just out of arm's length, but to her seeming miles away. \n\n\"Thank you, And- I mean Shade for walking this headache back here.\" She said holding Norman's hand. Shade nodded preparing to warp away until Norman stopped him. \"Hey Shade was it?\" Norman spoke to Shade like an old friend he was seeing for the first time in awhile. \"Thank you for walking me here, I just wanted to ask that if you see my kid out there tell him to come by, I'd like that\" Norman spoke a slight tinge of sadness in his voice. \n\n\"Sure old man what's his name? Hero I mean of course can't go yelling his identity all over the city! HA- um sorry....\" Shade said swallowing the laughter. Norman's face lit up his wife staring at shade with eye's that dripped compassion, Shade wouldn't look at her, not anymore.\n\n\"It's fine! He goes by Shadowman, Moon Warrior, or something dark and forbidding like that.\" Norman's scattered mind tried to pull the old memory forward. Flashes of memories whipped past him like a train he needed to catch but, wouldn't slow for him. His son's powers manifesting, the accident that made him use them in public becoming a hero, Christmas a purple bow on a dark box, a young man crying near his bedside, fire cooking his flesh....\n\n\"It's okay Norman I think I know a guy who could help me find him\" Shade broke his thought process seeing the memories almost breaking the old man. \"Focus on your wife and getting better I'll tell your son you miss him.\" Shade waved them away Norman and his wife walking through the doors of the hospital. Shade sighed before disappearing he didn't need another hero running at him in front of the hospital.\n\n\n--\nEdit: Thanks for the editing advice guys I'll try and clean it up my grammar was never good, as you can probably tell\n\nEdit 2: MY FIRST REDDIT GOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You need to look at your grammar especially; that's how the story will flow, and your sentences continue on and on and it sounds really weird plus it doesn't give the reader breaks as they're going it also helps to separate parts within a sentence and finally it is really hard to say a long sentence in your head or out loud. \n\nWriting that hurt. But I hope you can see what I mean. \n\nAt random, read this back - \"Thank you for walking me here I wanted to say if you see my kid out there tell him to come by I'd love to see him!\" \n\nHell, say it out loud. Can you comfortably say it? Does it sound like it flows well? \n\n\"Neroman responded his hero persona dropping out of him as his mind snapped to another personality almost instantly.\"\n\nAgain, same problem. I personally don't pretend to have perfect grammar, but it's something to consider. \n\nTry \"Neroman responded, his hero persona dropping out of him as his mind snapped to another personality almost instantly.\" That little comma adds a small break and helps it flow. I'd word it differently myself, but that's not the point; just that there needs to be more commas, more little breaks within the sentences.\n\nI quite enjoyed it mind you, just trying to offer some feedback to help you improve.

The blurred faces of the innocent crowd around us; the towering spires of the great city in the distance; the God-damned air we're all breathing! I have to keep going. One step at a time, one movement of my cane at a time, I near him.\n\n\"Put down your weapon, Baron Munchausen!\" I repeat, as sternly as my cigarette-roughened voice will allow.\n\nThis time, the costumed man turns to me. His cape flaps like a newspaper in the wind. \"Go home, old man,\" he says, grinning. He's always grinning. Why is it that he didn't grow old like me? Life never seems to be fair.\n\n\"Put down the sword,\" I command. He laughs. The crowd laughs. *Fools, can't they see that I'm trying to save them!*\n\nHe swishes and swashes the weapon in my direction, its radiance almost blinding me. He's taunting me. I raise an arm protectively over my eyes. At any moment, he could kill us all - he could release a ball of pure energy into their midst. I have to do something.\n\n\"Last chance,  Baron Munchausen!\" I tell him.\n\nAnother laugh. The crowd are jeering and yelling, but I can't process it all. Something about him putting on an act? He always was convincing.\n\n\"You watch too much tv, old man. Go home!\"\n\nMy arm trembles as I reach into my jacket pocket and retrieve my gun. I point it towards him. He's not laughing anymore. There are screams from the crowd - they know I mean business. People run. Sensible.\n\nHe drops the sword. Its light flickers, then dies.\n\n\"I'm - I'm sorry,\" he utters. His tights are becoming damp. Something's not right, but I can't think straight. I have to save the city.\n\n\"Too late. I've given you so many chances in the past, and you've squandered each and every one of them. This has to end. I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe nurse accompanies me in the police car. She says its not my fault, that I shouldn't have been able to get out. She asks where I got the gun from. Why isn't she more grateful? I saved her. I saved them all! \n\n\"I want to go home,\" I inform her. \"My tv program starts soon.\"\n\nHer lip quivers and her eyes moisten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "It was a brisk October morning. The park was full of people milling about and enjoying their Saturday morning, some were out on dates hoping to find true love, others were simply enjoying their time. Towards a wide river, many tables were set up so people could have a view of the mega city, enjoy a bite to eat, or play chess. Two older gentlemen were at one such table.\n\n\"Ah! Your hand left the piece!\" Said one man. His hair had greyed, but still held its dignified form of his youth, his hands had a slight tremble that comes with age. He wore an overcoat with a scarf tied around his neck.\n\n\"Matthias, how long must you attempt to distract me?\" The man who sat across from Matthias was bald, but his eyes still held the bright passion of youth. He was clad in simple monk robes, and wore spectacles on his nose. Matthias simply smiled at his companion.\n\n\"Just like old times, eh Monk?\" Monk looked up and smiled at his old nemesis turned friend.\n\"With you coming up with some scheme and becoming overconfident in your abilities?\" His hand shook as he captured a knight with his pawn. Matthias was dumbfounded.\n\"Wha...how...when...\" His voice trailed off in confusion.\n\nMonk smiled, crossed his arms, and leaned back.\n\"You always did overlook many things in your plans. Ironic isn't it? You were once known as The Front for you cleverness and wit.\" Monk began to chuckle as Matthias scrambled to recover.\n\"Ahh...i see now...\" The Front made his move after many moments of deliberation.\n\n\"Checkmate.\" Matthias was dumbfounded once again, as Monk had taken no time to decide his move. Matthias looked up to meet Monk's eyes, full of mischief.\n\n\"You always laid plans for certain events, but you never had plans for unaccounted happenings.\" Matthias sighed, this was the fifth time in a row he had been beaten.\n\nSuddenly a woman screamed, and a man clutching a purse began running along the path adjacent to the old timers. Suddenly the thief held a hand to his eye and ran headlong into a tree.\nMatthias looked over to see a piece missing from the board, and observed a hidden smile on Monk's face. Monk held a finger up to his lips.\nA young hero began running towards the recovering miscreant. \n\n\"Foul villain\" he began, \"you should never have attempted any misdeeds while I, Steelboy, yet draw breath!\"\n\nWith a single movement, he threw the vagabond over his shoulder, and threw the purse back to the crowd that was forming. He turned to leave when he spotted two elderly gentlemen enjoying a game of chess. He recognized one of them.\n\n\"The Front! Evil Front, you shall be captured by me this day!\" He struck up a fighting pose, and his former prisoner fell off his shoulder and ran off into the crowd.\nMatthias looked over to see the young hero challenging him.\n\n\"I believe he is looking for you.\" Matthias gave a look at Monk who had just delivered the sarcastic remark. He never knew Monk could be playful.\n\"Go away kid, i've done my time.\" He gave a dismissive wave and attempted to go back to enjoying his morning.\n\n\"Thought you could fool me eh? Steelboy never backs down!\" With this, he lunged towards the unsuspecting Matthias. As he reached the table a cane caught him in the gut, swung him around and threw him to the ground. Surprised, Steelboy looked up to see Monk standing know, both hands on his cane.\n\"Wait a minute, you're Monk! Why are you defending this man? You and he fought for years!\" Monk's face was as an elderly grandfather, attempting to teach his grandchildren.\n\n\"Young man, do you believe evil men will always be evil?\"\nThe question was blunt, and Steelboy attempted to respond as he stood up.\n\"Of course!\" He shouted.\n\"If you fall behind on a payment, does the bank not come after you?\" Matthias was as confused as Steelboy.\n\n\"Yet, if you pay the amount, is it not forgiven?\"\nSteelboy had no response.\n\n\"So if a man commits an evil act, he is behind on his payment, but should he atone for his misdeeds, he is paying the amount in the hopes of forgiveness. I believe this man has wronged many, but many years ago, he saw the errors of his ways, and turned his life around. His debt is large, but he is paying it back.\"\nSteelboy looked at him, then to Matthias, and then back to Monk.\n\n\"What on earth are you going on about? Loans? Payments? Who cares you old foggy, i'm taking him in!\"\n\nOnce again he lunged forward, aiming for Matthias, but Monk had other plans. He grabbed Steelboy's fist, and effortlessly threw him into the river.\nMonk sat back down, \"shall we play another game?\" He asked with a twinkle in his eye.\n\n",

            "comment": "Inferno really didn't mind looking after the old bugger but the mornings were by far the thing I dreaded the most. The majority of the time it went off without a hitch, but when it didnt...\n\n\"Good morning Blaise\"\n\nThe old man lying in the bed arose startled by the unfamiliar voice he had heard a thousand times before. \n\n'Who are you?\" the old man said, trying the best to hide the fear in his voice, \"and how do you know my name\" \n\nBlaise laid upright in his bed, his body trembling, his hands shaking. It was always hard to the greatest hero of his time cower in fear, but no matter how super they are father time always catches up with them eventually. \n\n\"My name is Inferno and I have been sent here by the League of Heroes to look after you today\"\n\n*Please buy it, please buy it, please buy it...*\n\nBlaise made a weary chuckled.\n\n\"Nice to see Terra Man hasn't forgotten about after all these years\"\n\n*Thankgod he bought it*\n\n\"But I don't need your charity\", his tone suddenly becoming much sterner as he slowly raised himself from his bed.\n\n*Ohh fuck...*\n\n\"Do you know who I am? I am the man who defeated the Juggernaut and freed Peru from his Tyrannic rule, I am the man who who single-handedly closed the Death Zone after scores of heroes before me had failed.\" Blaises voice was now trembling as he spoke, getting louder with each word coming from his mouth. \"Heck I was the man who bought down the League of Demise and bought this earth the greatest era of peace it has ever seen! I dont need no help! GODDAMMIT, I A PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER MY..!\" \n\nBlaise didn't get to finish his sentence as his robe got in the dresser, leaving him hurtling towards the ground. As quick as he could, Inferno stretched out his arms, catching the heaps bones before he hit the floor.\n\nInfreno hated when this happened. At first occurrences like these were far and in-between but the more the Alzheimer progressed and more stubborn and irrational Blaise had become. \n\n\"You know once upon a time I could  fight 10 guys at once all on my own, now I can't even stay on my own two feet...\" \n\nBlaise looked up at Inferno, tears welling in his eyes, his voice trembling. \n\n\"Look kid, just leave me be. I'm sure there are plenty of other things you want to do. You don't really want to be here.\" \n\nHe was partially right. Inferno didn't want to be there, he needed to be there. After all, it was all his fault. \n\n.\n\nIt was supposed to be the perfect plan. Excalibur and Dark Lighting were to go uptown and create a havoc large enough to distract the League of Heroes while Inferno was down town stealing the Crown Jewels that were on display in the National Museum in broad daylight. Simple enough, but there was one thing we didn't factor in. An old retired Superhero who was down at the museum that day. \n\nThe jewels were in the bag, Inferno was making his escape when the cry to \"Stop in the name of Justice!\" came out. Blaise stood there, relying heavily on his cane to remain upright.\n\nInferno laughed there was no way the old timer could stop him, everyone knows your powers are the first thing that goes. \n\n\"What are you going to do to me Blaise?\" he mocked \"Flick some amber at me?\"\n\nAt that moment Inferno learnt a valuable lesson, super powers weren't the first thing a Superhero loses. It was their ability to control them.\n\nInferno tried to keep the flames in check, but there was not much the young villain could do against the might of the hero Blaise. All he had meant to do was shoot a simple ball of fire in Infernos direction. Instead he had taken the lives of 27 innocent people and left half a city block destroyed. In the blink of an eye, the greatest hero the world had never know had become more infamous then even greatest villains had ever been. \n\nThe people he had spent his life protecting wanted him to rot behind bars, while those he had spent his life serving with disowned him, more worried about protecting their public image than helping the man who had brought them together and established the League of Justice.\n\nA world he had loved so much, a world he spent his life protecting had forgotten him. But those he had spent his life fighting, those he had spent his life putting behind bars couldn't forget him, especially after he had taken down the League of Demise. They hated the man, but not even they could bear to watch the demise of man each of them respected even if none of them would openly admit it. They wouldn't let him rot, they wouldn't disown him. After all, someone had to look out of him..\n\n\n.\n\nBliase remained weeping in Infernos arms. He couldn't bear to leave him like this.\n\n\"Your right Bliase I don't want to be here\"\n\nHe lifted Blaise onto the bed and looked into the old mans weary eyes, placing his hand on the old mand shoulder\n\n\"I don't want to be here\" he repeated once more. \"I want to be out there on that front porch, with a cup tea in my hand while you tell me the story of how you managed to close that Dead zone. What do you say?\"\n\nAnd as we had done every morning for the past 4 years, Blaise smiled. \n\n\n\n ",

            "comment": "The window shook from the intense wind outside. Sirens blaring just on the other side of the door. A pale skinned man stood in the center of a meeting room. Broken rays of light shined across his body, almost reflecting off of his pure white hair. The look in his eyes was both a warning and a challenge to any who would dare interrupt him.  \n\n\"I still remember that day. I was around 10 years old. The day the Monoliths arrived. Most of you were not even born yet, but you have seen what trauma one of them can cause. Imagine thousands of them swarming over everything in sight it was\"\n\nA sneeze echoed in the room. Everyone turned around to glare at a woman wearing a very dark brown cloak over a yellow spandex suit. A look of horror on her face.\n\n\"You have one warning Nomad\" said the man speaking. As he began to tell his story, again another sneeze half came out before her form turned to ash. Clearing his throat he began again.\n\n\"There was one light in the most darkest of times. The Chemist, yes that is a name you should all know. In fact, he saved me with a smile on his face. Though I doubt he remembers it. AND WHAT...\" lava started to spill out of his eyes as though crying in his rage. \"WAS HE REWARDED WITH! a life nearing its end, being called a burden or a pest.\"\n\nThe room began to buzz with noise and emotion. Disgust was the only universal thing that could be seen, even from the incorporeal bodies. How dare the Heroes treat their best like a piece of trash. \n\nThe sirens outside seemed to go quiet. The door to the heroes association burst open, a cloud of ash inside filled the air as the wind blew in. An old man wearing a lab coat entered dragging an IV stand along with him. An oxygen mask adorning his face.\n\n\"Surrender you vile villains\" he wheezed through the systematic pumping of his oxygen tank. \n\nThe speaker winked at all of the people in the room. he spun around dramatically, holding his cape outstretched.\n\n\"NEVER!\" The speaker rose into the sky, long white and silver robes swimming down his body. fire dancing around him almost mesmerizing all who saw him. \n\n\"I Am Sol, Leader of the Villains of the world. You can never hope to stop me!\"\n\nThe room all jumped into action. fire, lightning, lasers, ice, telekenitic blasts and insects swarmed the building from the outside. The police were all taking cover. A few were devoured by bugs or eviscerated by flying blades of force. \n\nInside, a tiny frail fist hit the ground. A force once strong enough to shake the city, only now tipped over a chair, but everyone still fell to the ground. Sol flew at Chemist fire slagging the air vents above. The fight went on for a few slow minutes. \n\nFinally Chemist fell back, a look of determination and a smile across his face. He remained unmoving. Sol made his way over to the man and with a gesture closed Chemists eyes. Grabbing the zip ties from his belt.\n\n\"You will live forever, my dearest friend.\"\n\nThe following days headlines were the same all over the world. \"407 Heroes dead including Lady Lucidity during a raid. The Chemist sacrifices himself to save the world one more time in the capture of the 62 Assailants.\"\n\n   \n\nEdit: Sorry for any mistakes on Mobile. Tried to clean them up when I woke up. ",

            "comment": "\"Put down everything and put up your hands! Make one move, and you die!\"  \nHothead Fawkes waves his pistol at the people in the bank, who all immediately drop what they're doing and put up their hands as told.\n\nChubby Shark, Hothead's partner, takes out a small handheld device.  \n\"Sorry if you have an expensive phone, haha!\"  \nShark says as he pushes a button on the device, and immediately all the lights in the bank go out.  \n\"Electromagnetic pulse. Goodbye silent alarms, heh heh!\"  \nShark goes to the counters and commands one of the staff at gunpoint to fill his bags with cash. He laughs louder and louder as hundreds of thousands are poured out for him and Hothead to share.\n\nSuddenly, just as the last bag becomes full, a voice calls from the bank entrance.  \n\"You! You two naughty kids! I have come to stop you - for the millionth time!\"  \nThe eyes of the scared, shivering citizens in the bank light up with hope as they turn to see Captain Thunderbolt, the superhero of the city\u2026 50 years ago.\n\n\"How many times do I, do I have to teach you two a lesson, before you finally learn, that crime\u2026 is not the way to go!\"  \nCaptain Thunderbolt rumbles as he points his cane at Hothead Fawkes and Chubby Shark.  \n\"Okay, okay Thunderbolt, you got me again,\"  \nHothead puts his gun on the floor, and Captain Thunderbolt slowly walks towards him and breaks the gun with a powerful thrust of his cane.\n\nSeeing this, Chubby Shark makes a confused face.  \n\"Hothead, you're just gonna give up like that?\"  \nHothead Fawkes turns towards Shark, nodding.  \n\"Face it Shark. We grew up robbing banks and fighting Thunderbolt, and we've never won. What do you think makes this time different?\"\n\nShark lets out a long sigh, then drops his gun. He proceeds to hand the cash-filled bags to the bank staff.  \n\"Okay. You got us, Thunderbolt. Arrest us, do whatever you do.\"\n\n\"You know what, you two? I'll let you off this one time, because you surrendered. But, if I ever see you robbing banks again\u2026\"  \n\"Then you'll zap us with lightning?\"  \n\"\u2026yes, I'll zap you with lightning! Now get outta here, you little punks! Promise to yourself, that you'll\u2026 never commit a crime again!\"  \nCaptain Thunderbolt maintains his authoritative tone that he's been using for 50 years, even before his first encounter with Hothead and Shark.\n\nAs the two embarrassed criminals walk out of the bank, they are blinded by a flash. As the bright light fades away, they see a person blocking the way.  \nIt's a teenager wearing a bright blue jacket and long gym pants, hovering a few feet from the ground. She is Dawn, the girl born with mystical powers, and she has recently started to fight crime.\n\n\"Halt, bank robbers! Hand over the cash!\"  \nDawn yells with an inherited authoritative tone.  \n\"We already did. We're going home now, if you'd excuse us,\" says Hothead Fawkes, gesturing to the inside of the bank.  \nConfused, Dawn glances into the bank's glass doors and sees Captain Thunderbolt, slowly walking out.\n\n\"Grandpa? What are you doing here? Weren't you just at home watching TV?\"  \n\"I told you, Dawn. I'm Captain Thunderbolt! I've been fighting crime in this city before your father even met your mother!\"  \n\"Yeah, whatever, Gramps. Always rambling about your *'good old days'*. I'm gonna arrest these guys.\"\n\nChubby Shark taps Dawn on the shoulder.  \n\"You should listen to your grandpa, you know. He let us go.\"  \n\"Yes, I let them go! I even got them to return the cash they just robbed the bank for!\"  \nCaptain Thunderbolt shouts at Dawn with anger.  \n\"They're criminals, grandpa! They belong in prison!\"  \n\"No, they deserve to learn a lesson and\u2026 become good people again! I've given them their lesson, you don't get to interfere, little girl!\"  \n\n\"I'm done listening to these two argue. Let's go, Shark,\" Hothead says while shaking his head.  \n\"Hey, don't think about escaping!\" Dawn ignores her grandfather and throws a punch at Hothead Fawkes. He cries in pain.  \n\"Hey! She attacked you first, you have every right to fight back!\" Captain Thunderbolt yells as he throws Chubby Shark's gun to its owner.\n\nDawn is quick and strong and can fly, but she isn't bulletproof. Chubby Shark shoots at Dawn, and she manages to dodge every one of the shots, except for the last one, which scrapes her left thigh, and she tumbles to the ground. The partners immediately flee the scene.\n\nCaptain Thunderbolt walks over to Dawn with the help of his cane. She is panting heavily, and he can tell that she is scared out of her mind. This is the first time Dawn has been shot, albeit very mildly.\n\n\"Silly grandchild. That'll teach you a lesson.\"",

I have come here...\" his eyes began to glaze over. \n\nChorus gently held his shoulder. \"Come now\" it said, a grandmother, \"where is your assistant, how did you get all the way up here\".\n\nFor a moment he seemed lucid, poised, annoyed. \"Damn assistant, never pays attention, real busy, no patience.\" He stood up straighter, his cane clattering to the ground, \"damn, why am I here again?\" He looked over to Chorus, almost grumpy \"you shouldn't put up with me you know, should just fry my ass like every other hero who gets close\".\n\nIf she could, Chorus would have smiled. Memories seemed to flicker within its core. \n\nThe darkness, spilling through portals across the city. Her fortress, in ruins. Bodies of villains scattered across the streets like so many seeds in the wind. Braur, his body bloodied and his face defiant. \"I have come to offer you, and the remaining villains, an alliance against the darkness.\"\n\nBraur, struggling against the darkness, standing alone to hold \"them\" back as the villains channeled one final spell. She would never forget him then. The look on his face when the spell fired. His arm missing, his eyes gouged, and a smile on his lips. He had raised his spear.. and collapsed.\n\nIn the present, Chorus guided Braur back to his room in the Hall of Heroes. \"No, I think you've earned this\". The flames seemed to smile. The League, on the other hand, was going to regret not taking good care of her oldest friend. \n\n",

            "comment": "**So this got a little away from me and doesn't exactly follow the prompt but I already wrote it so I'm going to post it and you guys can read or not**\n\nRampage claws at his neck, the air, at nothing at all. Nothing to grab onto but still he claws desperately. His entire body convulses, legs kicking desperately against the scorched blacktop. His neck popps softly as it continues to stretch, millimeter by millimeter, his head being pulled further from his shoulders like honey falling up.\n\n\"While I understand your eagerness, young hero, I also understand that you are over eager. Over eager and over confident. Both can be tempered, I suppose, in time however time is a luxury you simply do not have.\" The Tempest strolls around the gasping would be hero. \"I find it sad that so few youths cannot seem to understand that in this business their lack of knowledge could kill them any moment. You have heard of me, yes? You do understand what you have stepped into, do you not? Sad that you will not be able to learn from the experience.\"\n\nThe Tempest continues to stroll along the street, casually avoiding smoldering rubble. Plumes of smoke rise from the still burning building where Rampage had tried to ambush him. It had been laughably easy to see coming and even easier to stop. \"They say all good things come to an end; it follows that mediocre things come to an end... quicker.\"\n\n\"Tempest! Picking on kids I see? What's the matter, can't handle a real super hero?\"\n\nThe Tempest whirls, lips pulled back in a snarl. There he is, just like he always showed up over the decades, standing there without a care in the world. Just as he'd always kept his suit immaculate his loafers are spotless despite the street. Crisp slacks and a lint rolled vest. His cane even shined in the sunlight. He may be retired but he is certainly not slovenly.\n\n\"The boy had the gall to interrupt me. I was just doing him the courtesy of relieving him of his head.\" They both hear Rampage's sharp gasp as his neck pops again. \"Why, do you think you can do something about it, old man?\"\n\n\"We both know I can.\" The old man's voice comes from over The Tempest's left shoulder; he's still fast. \"I need you to release him.\"\n\nThe Tempest spins in a crouch, shooting both arms straight out. The old man flies back as if hit by a wrecking ball. He hits the very edge of the crumbling wall and jackknifes wildly through the air into the building, out of sight. The Tempest smirks and turns back to Rampage. \"Now, where were w-\"\n\nThe Tempest's head snaps around, his body struggling to spin fast enough to keep his head on his shoulders. He spins around several times before falling to the ground. Dazed, he simply stares at the sky, working his jaw slowly. Rampage suddenly draws in a deep breath, sucking air like a man who just found an oasis in the desert. He looks up to see the old man, his clothing torn in places, stained in others, standing over him. \n\n\"Go, you've no place here. Try not to overstep yourself again.\" The old man's eyes are hard and unforgiving. Rampage struggles to his feet and runs, leaving the old man staring coldly down at the stunned super villain.  Soon he's out of sight.\n\nThe air is still as the two regard each other amid the chaos. Far off sirens break the silence.\n\n\"Do you think he'll learn?\" The old man offers The Tempest a hand to help him up. \"He seems like he'll get the message.\"\n\nThe super villain accepts the help climbing to his feet. \"He will or he won't, we've done our part,\" The Tempest works his jaw, flinching slightly \"you certainly don't pull punches, even now. I didn't hurt you did I? I did cushion you from the wall.\"\n\nThe old man stretched. \"You did. You also ripped my slacks. Watch for word, I hear there's a young man a few cities over named Impact. Could probably do with a life lesson before he gets to a big city.\"\n\n\"I will.\" The Tempest sighed, but the old man was nowhere to be seen.",

Flux used his gravity bending powers to pull himself in an arc around the fallen villain. His curve was expertly timed and brought him face to face with the remaining thieving scum.\n\n\u201cToo late Flux!\u201d Arch Bishop bellowed. \u201cThe Radium is well on its way to our lair!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to make this quick.\u201d Flux smirked knowingly.\n\nHe pulled Mind Trap towards him. Her powers were too dangerous to delay. He simultaneously brought a nearby dumpster with his power and carefully squeezed it around her. The metal muting her mind powers and encasing her for the ULH\u2019s task forces. \n\n\u201cTwo down, Bishop, I hope you brought more friends. I\u2019m not even warmed up yet!\u201d Flux boasted.\n\nArch Bishop was on him quicker than he expected. He must really need this radium for some dastardly purpose. Flux weighted his arms with his control of gravity. Blocking Arch Bishops staff swings with his newly strengthened arms. Arch Bishop was not one to attack wildly. Flux knew he could use this to his advantage. He\u2019d let him tire himself before making one crushing assault to end the fight.\n\nFlux saw his moment. Arch Bishop\u2019s staff swung wide as his arms began to weaken.\n\n\u201cArms getting heavy, Bishop?\u201d Flux knew he had won. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve\u2026 gained some weight!\u201d\n\n Flux brought his power fully to bear. He was pulling his mental focus entirely onto Arch Bishop\u2019s form. Strength coursed through Arch Bishop like Flux had never seen. He was a mastermind not a brawler. How could he resist such weight for so long? Sweat formed on Flux\u2019s brow as he exerted every resource he had. \nArch Bishop buckled and fell; His knees leaving cracks in the pavement as he fell. Removing some of his own gravity Flux sprang forwards. \n\n\u201cBLACK HOLE PUNCH!\u201d He Announced in victory before increasing the weight and density of his right arm.\n\nArch Bishop never had a chance. Now he had to find that truck full of radium. Leaping over the skyline he began his search. A scream from the fallen Mephisto followed his bound.\n\n\u201cWE\u2019LL GET YOU NEXT TIME FLUX!\u201d\n\n--------------------------\n\n\u201cIs it done?\u201d an old haggard voice asked.\n\nRemoving her withered hand from his head; a fragile, and now aged, Mind Trap looked tearfully at an elderly Mephisto.\n\n\u201cThe dementia\u2026\u201d She choked on a sob. \u201cIt\u2019s making it harder\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI know Mind Trap.\u201d Mephisto reached for her shoulder and gave it a reassuring squeeze. \u201cNo one should live like that. At least we can give him these moments.\u201d\nMephisto placed his hand on the chest of his once greatest rival. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get you next time\u2026. Friend.\u201d\n",

            "comment": "(Not exactly senile but I liked the idea of an aging hero and a young, sympathetic villain).\n\nLightning crackled as a bolt screamed across the pavement, filling the air between the dock warehouses with a blinding blue flash. Tempest frowned as it struck Captain Tomorrow in the chest. \n\n\u201cYou used to be faster\u2026\u201d He mumbled as he slowly walked towards the twitching, barely conscious form of the aging hero. \u201cYou had it all: strength, speed, intelligence. Some even claimed you had telekinesis\u2026\u201d He knelt next to the large man and put a hand on his chest. Just as Captain Tomorrow\u2019s eyes closed, Tempest let out a small burst of electricity from his palm and Captain Tomorrow sprang up suddenly. \u201cI\u2019m not done with you yet, old man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just kill me?\u201d the defeated hero growled, his breathing ragged, one eye fused shut by lightning. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m a murderer?!\u201d Tempest shouted, hoisting the gigantic man through the air with all his might and shoving him against the brick wall before releasing him and turning away, staring up at the moon. \u201cI\u2019ve never killed a soul\u2026\u201d He whispered.\n\nCaptain Tomorrow tilted his head. Why had Tempest turned his back? The na\u00efve inexperience of a young villain? No, he had won this fight. He wasn\u2019t stupid. What was his game? \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter\u2026 you\u2019ve hurt plenty with your villainous actions.\u201d He spat.\n\nTempest turned back to the hulking figure sitting propped up against the wall; an artifact, a stalwart defender of a time long past. \u201cWhy do you fight?\u201d He asked the old man, staring into his greying eye.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2026 fight for\u2026\u201d Captain Tomorrow stammered, looking for the words. \u201cI fight for justice. I fight for those who cannot. I fight to keep evil at bay and t-\u201c\n\n\u201cCut the bullshit!\u201d Tempest sneered for a moment before taking a breath and regaining composure. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that canned crap. I want to know why YOU fight. This world is broken. Things aren\u2019t like they were. Lines have crossed, black and white have fused into a blurry grey. Heroes and Villains don\u2019t exist anymore. The Coalition of Defense dried up ages ago and your friends with it. Red Flag is locked up underground with dementia because it was \u2018too expensive\u2019 to attempt rehabilitation, Carrion is doing street performances for food, and Lightfoot offed himself after that false rape allegation had him labeled a menace to all. The world is not on your side. The PEOPLE are not on your side\u2026 why are you on theirs?\u201d\n\nCaptain Tomorrow stared with a wide eye at the young man standing before him. There was such passion in his words. A tear escaped the big man\u2019s eye, followed by another and another. Soon a steady stream of tears flowed down his cheeks as he ran a hand through his sparse, greying hair and let out an exasperated laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s all I know\u2026\u201d He cried. \u201cIt\u2019s all I know.\u201d\n\nTempest frowned at the big man out of pity. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d he said, gesturing towards the broken relic of a man \u201cThis is why I fight.\u201d He walked over and slid down the wall to sit next to Captain Tomorrow. As the man wept next to him, Tempest pulled out a cigarette and lit it with a spark from his thumb. \u201cYou\u2019ve been at this for 50 years, started while you were just a kid. You got picked up by the Coalition of Defense and made a career out of stopping Villains who wanted to destroy the world or rule it. But as time went on, those Villains found other ways to make their mark. They traded in their capes and lairs for three-piece suits and skyscrapers. Turns out ruling the world or destroying it is a lot easier than anyone thought.\u201d He took a long drag of the cigarette and passed it to the old man who took it warily and began to smoke.\n\n\u201cSo why do you fight?\u201d The hulking figure asked, wiping the tears from his face. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. You say that the villains are no more but you steal and destroy property, you cause mayhem. Why do you do it?\u201d\n\nTempest sighed and looked at the ground. \u201cMy father taught me to stand up for what I thought was right. He said that sometimes people would try to tell me I was wrong but if I listened to my heart, I could never fail. Those villains he fought are running the show now. They\u2019re in the corps, the government, and the law enforcement. Even our once renowned heroes don\u2019t get the care and respect they deserve because those who could get it done don\u2019t care. Not all of them are corrupt but like I said, everything is grey now. It\u2019s hard to distinguish between the good and the bad. All I have left to follow is my heart.\u201d\n\nThe old man put his head in his hands. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m too old for this. I\u2019ve been defending this city for so long and not once has it defended me. Your path sounds like vengeance but perhaps it\u2019s just the way of the world now.\u201d He sighed and dropped the cigarette into a puddle. \u201cWhat a world it is where people like you are the only ones who seem to give a shit.\u201d\nTempest smirked and hopped to his feet extending a hand toward the big man who hesitated before taking it and clambering to his feet. \n\n\u201cCome on\u2026. Let\u2019s go home dad.\u201d\n",

            "comment": "The Chameleon hung from the rafters of the headquarters cafeteria, listening in on various superhero conversations.  A raucous laughter drew his attention.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious!  Whenever Manman shows up, it\u2019s like all the villains just give up.  I swear to god!  I saw him use his \u2018super breath\u2019 - which can\u2019t even blow out the candles on his friggin\u2019 birthday cake anymore - and General Pain just lay down like Ma\u2026\u201d  \n\n\u201cNow, wait a minute, \u2018Agent Wonder\u2019.  You are brand new here.\u201d The Director piped in with a raised voice, biting off each word, \u201cManman was around before you were a twinkle in your Dad\u2019s eye.  He fought crime and cleaned up Cityburg before our headquarters existed.  He\u2019s the reason you have to leave the city to find work.\u201d  The Director, pausing for effect, met each pair of eyes at the table until their head lowered, \u201cHe has accomplished more in his lifetime than the whole group of you will think about accomplishing in your, no doubt, short \u2018super\u2019 existence.  You\u2019d do well to look upon Manman as a hero.  Study his moves.  Even imitate him.\u201d  With his point made, The Director walked briskly away.  \n\nThe Chameleon laughed internally at the shame he saw.  *These guys have no confidence. I could probably take them all out by myself.*  \n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you all tell me he was behind me?\u201d Agent Wonder asked accusingly.  \n\n\u201cDude\u2026 you know The Director can be listening at any moment.\u201d  Thunder Giant said as he watched The Director round the corner to the hall.  He continued in hushed tones, \u201cI know what you mean, though, Wonder.  About a month before he retired,\u201d using air quotes for the last word, \u201cI saw Manman hold off the Army of Evil in a cardboard fort using snow balls.  The entire Army of Evil.  Not just a couple of them.  ALL OF THEM.  And I\u2019m not certain of it, but I thought I heard the Army of Evil giggling.  Laughing even.  I mean, Manman still had a decent amount of strength back then, and a tightly compacted snowball to the face sucks, but, come on!\u201d   \n\nThe rest of the group sat, unconvinced, eying Thunder Giant doubtfully as the words sank in.  \n\nThe Chameleon saw a mixture of incredulity and disgust on the groups faces as he smiled at the memory of what would come to be known to every supervillain as The Great Fight.  A flurry of snowballs flew past his face.  The Chameleon rushed the enemy line completely hidden in camouflage.  He was just about to take Manman out when a flash of white and red covered his vision.  He opened his eyes and wondered why he was looking at sky.  He couldn\u2019t believe it when a laugh escaped his lips.  And not his villain laugh, either, but a full-on laugh from his belly.  He hadn\u2019t laughed like that in ages.  He didn\u2019t even know he was capable of it anymore.  Of course, Manman now had his position and he was pelted with snowballs as he ran away, but he did so while laughing with glee.  It was \u201cThe Great Fight\u201d not because they lost many comrades that day, and not because it was difficult experience, but because it was the most fun any of the villains had had since their innocence was stolen and they were forced into a life of crime.  The voices below brought him back to the cafeteria.  \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying!\u201d  Agent Wonder loudly whispered.  \u201cIt\u2019s like they just give him a free pass!  It makes me wonder if any of the stories of him are true.  I don\u2019t believe them.  He\u2019s washed up now and he was washed up back then.\u201d  \n\nThe rest of the group still didn\u2019t look convinced, but The Chameleon had heard enough.  \u201cHow dare you speak that way about Manman!  Manman gave me my first scar.  Manman was the reason I was given each of my life sentences and Manman did it with style!  I was able to keep my pride intact when Manman allowed me to turn myself in!  He even cleaned me up and told me, \u2018Next time just believe in yourself and you\u2019ll accomplish things you\u2019ve only dreamed about!\u2019  And that was exactly what I needed to hear, because I was just about to take a job as a computer technician!\u201d  \n \n*Uh-oh*, The Chameleon thought.  He now looked at an entire army of masked and caped men who were looking back toward him.  They couldn\u2019t see him, but it was only a matter of time before\u2026  *No way!*  \n\nManman rounded the corner in his super ill-fitting suit.  His belly was beginning to peek out from under his shirt and he was hunched over a walking cane\u2026 but his frame was still imposing.  Manman carried his Killerang in his free hand and had it drawn back, ready to throw.  \n\n\u201cYou rang?\u201d  Manman said in his whispery imitation of his once super voice.  \n\n\u201cUh\u2026 I didn\u2019t know you came out of retirement Manman.\u201d  The Chameleon said apologetically.  \n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m still retired.  I just heard my name!\u201d  Manman pointed with his Killerang to the extremely large hearing aids pushing down his ears.  \n\nBefore The Chameleon could respond, Manman threw his Killerang with all his might and The Chameleon fell from the rafters.  The Killerang bounced and clattered as it came to a rest only a few feet from Manman, but The Chameleon was now on the floor and in full view of the rest of headquarters.  \u201cAnd let that be a lesson to you The Chameleon!\u201d  Manman called over his shoulder.  \n\n*He is the only one who remembers my name.*  \u201cCurse you!\u201d  The Chameleon yelled while thinking, *God, I love that guy.*  \n\nThe onlookers, stunned, mouths agape, tried to figure out what had just happened.  The Chameleon smiled as they looked at the Killerang, then at The Chameleon, then back at the Killerang, then back at The Chameleon.  They all turned toward the door in unison as The Director said, \u201cStill got it,\u201d and high-fived a smiling Manman.\n",

            "comment": "Not quite the prompt but I still had fun with it. \n\n\nAlchemist breathed in a deep breath of the morning air; the sun was shinning, the birds were singing, and her heist was going perfectly. Fifty feet bellow the gold-plated villain a group of mercenaries worked within a force field to strip an armored truck of all its valuables. \n\n\nAlchemist heard a ding as her helmet HUD altered her to the ETA of the police, both normal and super. She shook her head. The officers of the law were like clockwork, dependable and predictable. She touched the side of her multifaceted helmet activating her com.\n\n\n\u201cAll right boys we\u2019ve got just under five minutes. I want that gold sky high and this wrapped up in three,\u201d she ordered. \n\nThere was a chorus of grunts and affirmatives. \n\n\u201cExcuse me! Oh, excuse me!\u201d An aged voice called out. \n\n\u201cBarrier breached,\u201d a soft artificial voice warned Alchemist. \n\nAlchemist looked down and her helmet zoomed in on her robbery. Five stories bellow her all fifteen mercenaries whipped out their guns out and pointed them at the intruder, a tottering old lady. Her high jacked facial recognition software found a match for the senior citizen. \n\n\nBrenda Long\nEx-Enhanced Police Force Officer\nCode name: Sorceress \nService record: 1972 \u2013 2000\nBlack Star Officer\nOver 1,000 crises averted\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me! Ms. Alchemist?\u201d the old lady said. \n\n\nAlchemist frowned. Heroes and villains didn\u2019t mix, even after retirement. What was she doing here? Did she think she was the Sorceress again? It would be crazy for the old bat to announce her position and then try to pull off an attack. She was probably just senile. \n\n\n\u201cHold your fire, stand down.\u201d Alchemist said. \n\n\nThere was a burst of stun bolts from a grunt guarding the perimeter. Fortunately the bolts sprayed around the old lady leaving her unharmed. \n\n\u201cI said stand down!\u201d Alchemist barked. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so terribly sorry but I need to talk to you,\u201d the lady continued. \n\nAlchemist sighed and leaned forward on her hover board beginning her decent. \n\n\n\u201cSkuts, you\u2019re fired. Flint and Joana will escort you back to base. I want your paperwork, gun, and uniform on my desk tomorrow morning. Glenn, Swanson, Cuevas guard the lovely old lady. Everyone else get the gold back to base. Sing you\u2019re in charge.\u201d\n\n\nAlchemist\u2019s overcoat fluttered in the wind as she dove down to the ground. It was a pain in the ass to clean but damn it made her look dramatic. She pulled back slowing her decent then she jumped off her board, tucked it under arm, and landed in a single smooth motion. \n\n\n\u201cGood afternoon madam. I heard you were looking for me?\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m so lucky I heard about your robbery on the news. You see I need some help and my old contacts aren\u2019t answering me and the Force just doesn\u2019t have time for a washed up officer like me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad it was you, the marvelous Alchemist. You\u2019re a bit of a showboat, with all the gold and your fancy thingy-bobbers.\u201d Mrs. Long gestured to Alchemist\u2019s suit and the force field. \u201cBut you are a professional young lady. Not like the other villains these days with their pointy outfits and murdering and ignoring the quiet hours.\u201d \n\n\nMrs. Long\u2019s words were finally cut short by the roar of the cargo rockets taking off. Cargo rockets were Alchemist\u2019s personal brainchild. Do you have any idea how fucking hard it is to catch/stop a missile full of stolen loot? Even for superheroes it was practically impossible. \n\nHer henchmen exchanged a look. So Mrs. Long was just senile. Whatever. Alchemist waved away the guards. She could handle this.\n\n\n\u201cWell I do pride myself on pulling off the cleanest jobs in the city. I always say if you have to resort to indiscriminate killing create fear you then you just aren\u2019t a real villain,\u201d Alchemist said. \u201cNow I appreciate the attention but I really need you to go-\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just so good at finding things that don\u2019t belong to you,\u201d Mrs. Long said with a dangerous glint in her eye. \n\n\nAlchemist froze.  \n\n\n\u201cThe hoover board looks so much better without Nightmare Punch\u2019s green and pink paint job. And the upgrades you\u2019ve made to Dr. Dread\u2019s stungun are noting short of amazing. But I don\u2019t think he would appreciate you stealing his design, oh no.\u201d\n\n\nSuper battles were always messy. Both sides had to abandon weapons and gear in the heat of the fight. And well, you know what they say, Finders keepers, Looser weepers. But that didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t sore losers. Loser who would very much like Alchemist\u2019s severed head on a plate. \n\nSirens sounded in the distance marking the arrival of the police. The roar of helicopter blades warned of the approaching Enhanced Force. \n\n\n\u201cAs I was saying Madam,\u201d Alchemist said with an exaggerated arm sweep, \u201cmature citizen such as yourself are so often ignored for the wealth of information that they are. I would happy to help you with whatever you need.\u201d\n",

Thanks Stephen King - jerk.\n\nGrabbing a towel from an over turned baby cart, the loathsome Gravitor sauntered casually over to the ice cream stand. \n\nThe attendant was nowhere to be seen... typical of these low work ethic kids these days.  Back in the day, you would be expected to man that stand until ...well, never mind.\n\nSometimes if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.\n\nIn short order, the dark and dangerous Gravitor had whipped up a super sundae of epic proportions.  It would be tastiness sung of by bards for generations to come...\n\nSTOP, VILLAIN!\n\nStartled, Gravitor looked up.  Standing before him was the fabled Lightning, his arch nemesis.  His now silver locks and square jaw as equally impressive as they ever had been.\n\nThe two stared each other down for a moment, daring one another to move.\n\nLightnings features softened and his eyes clouded over a bit.  He spoke, his voice less certain, almost as if distant...\n\n\"My wife...have you seen her?  She was here...I think.  I don't know where she is.  Have you seen my wife?\n\nGravitor smiled genuinely, almost sweetly. \n\n\"I'm sorry sir, I haven't seen her anywhere. Ice cream?\"\n\nLightning nodded, greedily eying the overflowing bowl.  Suddenly, concern spread across his face as he glanced nervously around before casting his gaze dejectedly at his feet.\n\n\"It's alright, sir, you already paid.\"\n\nWith that, Gravitor watched his old arch nemesis shuffle off happily down the street.  Being bad keeps getting harder to do every day.",

            "comment": "To the Justice Unit, he was a mere has been. To us, however, he was a milestone in all of our lives. My father,  Mega-Kill Sr., was his arch nemesis for decades. I remember when I was 17 or 16, my pops gave me his suit. He said to me; \"Georgie,  if you want to be a real villain,  you gotta know how to fight a super.\" So with me wearing the mega-elector suit  (which was about 3 sizes to big) and a death blaster, I made my way to mainstreet during the lunch or dinner  hour, but i'm not sure what time it was, it would be around 30  years ago. So I raise the death blaster, I aimed it at something like a mail box or a fire hydrant, or something, and before I could even press the trigger,  there he was. Maximum Justice; Head founder of the Justice Unit. He appeared right next to me and crushed the gun's barell between 2 of his fingers. I went into punch him, crashed my fist straight on his nose. Broke my hand for 4 months. He didn't hit me back, god knows I deserved it though. I was just a punk trying to be like his punk father. Looking back, I think Maximum Justice knew that. It wasn't just me though, all the members of the Tyranny Union  had parent super villians, whom most of us took our names from. 400 villains in the tyranny Union,  all of whom got their start with Maximum Justice. \nSomewhere over the years things began to change for Maximum. He got slower, weaker, older. Any Tyranny Union member could of killed him years ago, but none of us could. We had to much respect for the man who was a giant in this industry. The heroes, those jack ass', never understood that. That the man they would be little was the foundation of what they do. Oh it made me sick. During the usual street brawls, they would force Maximum Justice to stay in the car, like a kid or a dog. Treating him as an errand boy, giving him demeaning jobs to make him feel useful. Who makes Maximum Justice take out his dry cleaning and get his coffee? \nThe man is dead now. Died of a cardiac arrest in Justice Unit Headquarters. A warrior like him didn't deserve such a mediocre death. He should of died saving the planet, like he always invisioned. Sone people think that's why he stayed with the Justice Unit, so he could have the death he deserved, like his fallen comrades had. One died in an a alin attack, one died redirecting a nuke into space, the other died stopping the sun exploding. But Maximum Justice, the icon, the legend, dies because of a cardiac arrest? It's not fair.\nI arrived to his funeral out of costume, along with other Tyranny Union members. What we found was nothing less of disgusting. The Justice Unit had passed on the responsibility of planning his funeral, unlike what they had done for other members who received statues and magnificent pieces of art that honored them. All Maximum got was a small church, with only the Tyranny Union and an old Priest to pay final respect. The public itself completely disassociate itself with the great hero. The Hercules of the modern Era, gone and forgotten. \n\nNo. This will not stand. The Tyranny Union will make this city and the Justice Union mourn. \n",

Gotta remember, we didn't know shit at first, just watching this guy jump off rooftops and finding rapists on 4th street missing all their teeth. We thought he had magic powers like the rest of the freaks, no joke.\n\nThis fuckin' guy, he made people afraid like he was Santa Claus or some shit like that, like, *like he knew when you're sleeping and awake*, that kind of thing. Ha ha, but it was scary as shit back in the day. I'm telling you kid, *it was just one guy*. Living a double life so everyone think's he's some dipshit playboy? That's wild, ain't it? He ain't like those people we deal with now, they don't got no balls. They could never pull off the kind of personal dedication, hard work, risk to themselves needed, to pull something like that.

            "comment": "Warhead could feel the man\u2019s eyes on him as he walked down the brightly lit hallway, passing through all of the millimeter scanners, metal detectors, and other high tech security measures that stood between him and his destination. \n\n//This prison is much nicer than that piece of scum deserves, he thought to himself. Too bad all of this is necessary to keep him in check.\n\nThe man he was going to see had been the most notorious and destructive villain of an age flooded with heroes and villains alike. The Maroon Marauder had been taken too lightly at the beginning of his career. He was nothing more than a bankrobber, and had never gone up against a superhero. It was believed that his powers were trivial at best, even his name was laughable. But When the Marauder transitioned from bank robbing to plans of world domination and other larger schemes, he demolished almost every hero he came up against. Few could claim to have faced him in pitched battle and lived to tell the tale. \n\nWhen Warhead finally made it to the end of the hall, and saw the man that this high tech prison had been specifically designed to contain, he could not help but feel the same sense of disappointment he always felt. \n\n//This is the man who\u2019s name caused the world to tremble in fear? \n\nThe Marauder\u2019s powers had slowed his aging, both physically and intangibly. While other villains of his age lost control of their powers with the advancement of time, the Marauder had only grown more powerful, discovering and honing new abilities over the course of what would have been many lifetimes. \nWarhead and the Marauder stared at each other for minutes before either spoke. The villain was built like your average middle aged man- obviously with some strength in him, but not in the best shape. In his pale grey prison jumpsuit, the man looked even less like a super villain than he did the day Warhead had finally apprehended him. Then, the man had looked like any other average Joe in a black suit. He was nowhere near as visually intimidating as some of his contemporaries, but his eyes betrayed a cold intelligence that was enough to make even Warhead doubt himself. \n\nThe villain finally broke the silence. \u201cSo you\u2019ve finally come to see me? I had estimated you would have made an appearance to gloat over your victory long before this.\u201d \n\nWarhead just chuckled. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for that. You know why I\u2019m here. Give up the location of your doomsday devices. The League believes them too dangerous to be left in the world, even if no one has ever discovered your \u2018lair of dismay\u2019.\u201d His voice dripped with sarcasm and arrogance, and it did not go unnoticed.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give them up, but first you and I need to talk.\u201d The villain finally said, an air of frustration around him. \u201cWhat you did that day was disgusting, and I need to know how anyone could justify your actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat actions?\u201d Warhead roared with laughter, \u201cBringing down the most notorious villain in the galaxy? I did something no hero before me could. Not even Captain Fission could stop you, and I did it before any of your henchmen even had a chance to react!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe disrespect you still show him is unacceptable! Captain Fission was the greatest hero this world has ever seen! The measure of a hero does not only lie in strength, boy. That is the one lesson it seems you failed to learn from him.\u201d The Marauder tossed back, anger now visible in his eyes.\n\n\u201cLEARN FROM HIM?\u201d The air around Warhead began to shimmer with radiation. Warhead didn\u2019t notice until the alarms started blaring and flashing red light. Warhead reigned in his signature heat, but his rage was still palpable. \u201cThat man taught me nothing. Everything I am, I made myself. What is more important in a hero than the strength of his power?\u201d He asked through gritted teeth.\n\n\u201cCompassion. Loyalty. Duty. Honor. Any of these, and so many more! Fission was more than just a bomb, you oaf! He truly believed in what he was doing. He did it to protect innocents, not to win fame and glory! You cast him out of the league that he founded!\u201d The Marauder spat, with growing animosity.\n\n\"He was useless! Old, weak, unable to control his powers! He was a danger to everyone in the same room as him. He gave Wonderboy radiation poisoning! Who knows how many others he could have hurt if we had kept him around!\u201d Warhead retorted. \n\n\"The league was his life! His friends, his family! And you just threw him on the street!\u201d The Marauder responded. \u201cA man who had done that much good deserved more respect. A pension at the least, and visits when he took a turn for the worst. His lifelong friends even stopped coming to see him. His children\u2026\u201d\n\n\"What is the point in this? I\u2019m growing impatient, old man.\" Warhead spat. The air was beginning to shimmer again. \u201cJust tell me the location of your hideout so I can leave and be done with all of this.\u201d\n\nAt this the Marauder\u2019s composure broke. Tears streamed down his face- \u201cYou and the league showed no respect for him in life, but even the worst villains can honor the dead. How dare you interrupt his funeral? How many of us did you arrest that day? We showed up to honor that man, the one man who truly made each and every one of us question why crime was our career. The one man capable of teaching regret\u2026 The one man who ever showed me compassion\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t act like you knew him.\u201d Warhead fired back, with venom in his voice. \u201cNo one knew him.\u201d\n    \n\u201cBut I grew to know him. I visited him every day in the hospital. I designed the suits that made it safe for doctors and nurses to be within a mile of him. Every one of the villains you arrested that day did more for him when he was vulnerable than any of his \u2018friends\u2019 did when he was strong.\u201d The Marauder retorted, his voice barely more than a whisper. He was crumpling, eyes glistening. \u201cYou know he spoke of you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Nothing you say can make me forgive him. I gave him everything he ever gave me.\u201d Warhead retorted. His skin now began to shimmer and glow, setting off the alarms again. \n\n\u201cHe did. He regretted missing so much of your life. The baseball games, the choir concerts, everything. He still had all of your trophies, and your sister\u2019s too. Even the soccer participation trophy from the one season you played in the fourth grade.\u201d Tears were rolling down the Marauder\u2019s face at this point. \u201cHe was sorry. Fission- your father- he was trying to make the world safe for you, so you wouldn\u2019t have to live the life he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cSHUT YOUR MOUTH!\u201d Warhead roared. \u201cHe was never there for me, for my sister, for anyone! He spent so much time saving his \u2018precious innocents\u2019 that he forgot to raise his children!\u201d \n\nMemories flash before Warhead\u2019s eyes, but they were not his. A projection, probably an unknown power of the Marauder\u2019s. He sees an old man struggling along with a walker, slowly hobbling next to the Marauder, with a relaxed smile on his face. \nThe same man, now with tears streaming down his face and look of confusion and hurt as his own powers cause him to be wracked with pain. \nThat man again, proudly holding a newspaper with a photo of Warhead in his hands, saying \u201cThis is my son! I'm so proud of him!\u201d\n\nThe man, now lying still, apparently sleeping peacefully.\nThis man again, lying in his best suit in a wooden box. The viewpoint turns, scanning the vast sea of empty chairs. Few people are in attendance- Warhead recognized them all as Super villains, all of whom Captain Fission had arrested at one point or another.\n                \nSuddenly the ground shakes and the sky turns red. The man\u2019s coffin collapses and he falls into the freshly dug grave, and Warhead sees himself sprinting into view, followed closely by a few other heroes. The projection goes black, and then fades from view.\n\nWarhead straightened up, cast one last heartless glance at the Marauder, and began to walk away.\n\n//What a complete waste of time. I guess I'll have to find the devices the old fashioned way.\n\nThe Marauder wilted like an unwatered flower. \u201cI see this is futile. Well, if you won\u2019t remember all of the good that he did, or the lives he saved, we will. He deserved more than you gave him. He deserved a family that loved him the way he loved you.\"\n\n// Sorry about the father/son trope, but I thought it would add weight to the story. Sorry for any typos/awkward formatting, I'm on mobile.\n\n*edit: formatting, spelling",

It looks great!\"\n\n\"Thanks.  I made it myself.\" \n\n\"I'm sure he'd love a visit.  Just be mindful if he falls asleep.  Let a nurse know so we can move him to bed. We take good care of that man.  He's in room A24.  It's down that hallway there and then take a left at the end. Here, just sign in on the log.\"\n\nHe signed in with his false identity made for this purpose.  Henry Holcomb.  It was his original name, before the shifting series of names, fronts, shell corporations, and endless amounts of paperwork had obscured him for decades.  He paid taxes under this name, had a retirement account, and subscribed to three magazines.  It was a carefully cultivated lie.  It was iron clad if anyone from the police to the United Nations should look.  It was only transparent to one person, who had known his name many years earlier.\n\n\"Give it up, Green Error!\"\n\n\"That's the Green Terror!\"\n\n\"It's actually Henry Holcomb.  Here, let me show you something.\"  \nThe Atomic Crusader lifted the Green Terror high into the sky. \n\n\"I've just destroyed the wiring of your suit, by the way.  When you untangle it at home, you'll find it's been transformed into spaghetti!  Ha ha!\"\n\nThe Green Terror wiggled his toes, testing the switches in his boots, but to no avail.  His suit was suddenly unresponsive.\n\nDown the hall, then left at the end.  A courtesy knock, probably unnecessary.\n\n\"Robert?\"\n\n\"Yes? Oh, is that you Henry?\"\n\n\"Yes sir. I thought I'd drop in for a hello.\"\n\n\"Well, pull up a chair, kid.  Have some lemonade.  They make a pitcher every afternoon.  I'm happy to share.\"\n\nHenry, aka the Green Terror, sat and humbly accepted a glass of very sweet lemonade.  He always did. \n\n\"Hey kid, dya remember when you stole that truck full of lemons? That was a real laugh riot!\"\n\n\"I do!  I had forgotten about that. I'm not even sure I was gonna do with all those lemons. Probably try to sell them on the black market.  That was a harebrained scheme.\"  He left it himself, and his young and eager hubris, sometimes woefully misguided.  \"Who would buy lemons on the black market?\"  They both laughed.\n\n\"See that, Henry?  You can see all of New York from up here, as well as parts of Connecticut and New Jersey.  Do you know why I brought you up here?\"\n\n\"Are you gonna kill me?\"\n\n\"Oh no, ha ha! Look!\"  Atomic Crusader's eyes glowed white.  The planet below, lit by moonlight, changed.  The land was gone.  A vast ocean churned beneath them.\n\n\"What did you do?  What the hell happened?\"\n\n\"I erased the land masses of planet.  Actually, I altered them so they were all below sea level.  A lot of the geology is the same, though a lot of mass has been taken away.  I also had to add lots of water.  The whole thing took nearly three microseconds.  And you like to rob banks!! Hahahahahaha!  It's hilarious!\"  The planet below changed back to it's former self.  Atomic Crusader started lowering down to the lights of Manhattan.\n\n\"Are you like a god?  Why even bother with the costume?\"\n\n\"It's more fun this way.  It has been for a long time.\"\n\n\"How long?\"\n\n\"Before I was Atomic Crusader, I was just a kid named Bob Theriuault.  Before that I was a man named Robert Thierry.  But most people knew me as the Emancipator.\"\n\n\"That was like 70 years ago!  One of the masks of the Civil War!\"\n\n\"Yes, and before that I was Minute Man.  I've also been called Privateer Black, the Mason, and a bunch of other names.  I once fought under Boudicca, and once for Alexander, who actually did conquer the world once, but then he went mad and started killing people en masse.  I changed things so that he died young.  Such an arrogant man.\"\n\n\"No one will believe me, will they?\"\n\n\"No one.  If you tell, I'll just change it so that you never did.  It's okay.  Keep robbing banks, Henry.  Just don't ever kill anyone.  And if you ever do by accident, let me know immediately.  I'll help.\"  They landed on a very tall building.\n\n\"Where am I?\"\n\n\"The Empire State Building.  One minor change.  It's got a great view.  So long!\"\n\n\n\"I never robbed another bank, you know.\"\n\n\"I know.  I was the guy who used to chase you.  You specialized in colorful but relatively benign pursuits.  Your costumes got more and more ridiculous.\"\n\n\"My seventies one was the worst.  It was a green leisure suit, but I had so many gadgets inside, it was five sizes too big!\"\n\n\"You did look like a kid trying on his father's suit.  My favorite was your 1955 look. Cape, domino mask, and it wasn't even apparent you had gadgets inside.  I appreciated the effort.\"\n\n\"I played my part.\"\n\nThe Atomic Crusader looked wistful. He sipped his lemonade.\n\n\"Henry, I'm dying.  Well, not really, but they're going to find my corpse here one morning.  I'm going to have to move on.\"\n\n\"Oh.  You're going to make yourself look younger?\"\n\n\"Oh it's not just looks.  I have to reconfigure my body.  I will look very different.  It's been fun.  You made for a great nemesis.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to attack your funeral?  I could hold Silver Squad hostage?  Those young guys are arrogant.  They're all bullets and swear words.  They lack imagination.\"\n\n\"Ha!  Hahaha!  Follow your heart, Henry!\"",

Despite his age, the old dreg still looks dapper as he was in his prime, it's a pity this old clock is falling apart beneath that fresh varnish.\n\n\"You have to actually stop me first, Streak.\" I taunted, smirking at him.\n\nTrue to his name, Streak flew at me like a blur of mass, his signature blue lightning trailing behind.

Hardest part of the job, trying to kill an old man without actually killing him.

I fought back the impulse to retaliate with lethal force and do a countdown to when he would drain himself. At the stroke of zero, I dropped to a half kneel as part of the act, but mostly because I can't stop my legs from trembling. Gosh, babysitting this old fogey is a high-stress job.\n\n\"Your powers have grown again, Streak.

He nearly got himself killed last time. Streak responds in kind and throws the first punch.\n\nWhat was the expression again? Float like a butterfly, Stink like a soiled diaper? Yes, my dear Streak has soiled his diaper. I pray for the all clear to come before his spouts of lucidity comes back, hate to see the old squirt embarrassed in public.\n\nGod must be listening, because right as his next strike was about to land, the telepathic channel buzzed to life with Psych's voice calling for retreat. On hindsight, I think she's the one listening, not god. Psych, you still there?

            "comment": "*This isn't exactly following the writing prompt, but it's what my imagination spat out* \n\n\u201cThey killed Necroblighter\u201d The old man said.\n\n\u201cYep\u201d his friend replied after taking a sip of iced tea. \u201cI heard from my granddaughter. They staked him down and let him burn to death in the sunlight. Bad way to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's all these danged upstarts. They don't even call themselves heroes anymore. Now everybody's got to be an 'antihero', and be dark and brooding\u201d.  \n\n\u201cIt's not just these new heroes. The villains too. They're nothing like they once were. We had a code. We might take over the world, or steal millions, but we had basic decency. You remember what that monster last year did to all those kids. The league of villains would have never stood for that back in our day. And while I'm at it, what kind of silly name is 'Necroblighter'? The old villains, they had some good names. 'Zebulax'. That's a name that makes you afraid. Makes you wonder what he can do.\u201d \n\nThe two old men sat in their rocking chairs on the front porch of the sprawling house, lost in old times. \nAfter long minutes of reverie, the old man's friend spoke again. \u201cYou know it was folks like Captain Amazing that kept us in line. No matter how many times he caught us, he never treated us badly. Always believed we could be reformed. I guess having someone believe in us gave us some faith in ourselves, even if it was only a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no Captain Amazing anymore\u201d the old man said. \u201cjust some old geezer with a suit that doesn't fit, arthritic knees, and no pension. I always said crime didn't pay, but I never realized that selflessness doesn't get you too much either. Every time somebody offered me a reward, I'd turn it down.\u201d\n\nThe old man's friend grimaced. \u201ctweren't right of the city. Use you for 30 good years, and then put you out to pasture with a key to the city made of fake gold. 'twern't right.\u201d\n\nCaptain Amazing sighed; \u201cI guess they got so used to me turning down rewards they never thought about it. It's you guys who really remembered us in the end. You're a good friend, Zeb\u201d \n\nZebulax shrugged. \u201cwell what else could we do. I know you've saved every one of us from certain death countless times. Remember our fight on the top of Dead Man's Cliff? I slipped on those rocks, and you jumped over the cliff to save me, even after I had tried to kill you. Never thought twice about it. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. Besides, our crime really did pay. We can afford it.\u201d\n\nThe Captain stared into the distance, watching the sun set. When dark had come, he stood up. \u201cWell,\u201d he said with a stretch, \u201cI guess I'll turn in early. Mindmaiden had another vision last night. There's a little boy that's going to get lost tomorrow on his way to school. If nobody helps him, he'll end up in a bad way. I reckon a couple of the boys and me will go down and help him out.\u201d\n\nZebulax drained his iced tea and stood up with Captain Amazing. \u201cMind if I come along, Cap? Sounds like it might be fun.\u201d \n\nThe Captain grinned faintly in the dark as they walked back into the League of Villains Retirement Home; \u201csure Zeb. I'd like that a lot.\u201d ",

            "comment": "Sure Captain Honor admitted the young heroes caught more criminals in quantity, but Captain Honor was adamant about beating them in quality. He caught more real super villains than anyone else. The real big names like DoubleShot, BadBaller, KingCruel were caught by none other than Captain Honor himself. And he did it with just his tried and true powers of enhanced strength and agility without the need for fancy new technology. Although, for some reason the criminals he caught seemed to be able to escape prison whenever they wanted.\n\nBut one day the scariest most violent villain of them all, Sin, kidnapped the mayor of the city and after executing several prominent businessmen and politicians. Sin demanded chemicals and equipment which seemed to obviously be for weapons by the end of the day. The heroes guild only managed to recruit 3 super heroes in time to make a rescue attempt before Sin's ransom timer was up. Though the honorable captain was ready they didn't recruit him for the cause. Dishonored, the captain decided to force his way into the group.\n\n\"Why didn't you guys call me for help?\" he asked them. The 3 other heroes grew awkwardly silent until their leader, HellMan responded \"we didn't want to disturb your retirement\" to which Honor replied \"I'm not retired. I'll never retire.\" Hellman's patience ran out, though to be fair he was half demon and didn't have much to start with, and he said \"Look old man, you're just going to get in the way\". The Captain looked to the other two heroes and asked \"WaterGirl, SteelHawk, do you really agree with this guy?\" They looked away from him too bashful to say anything, but in obvious agreement with HellMan. \"I remember when these guys were just a bunch of kids trying to fit-in with the normals in school\" thought Honor. \"I'm coming whether you're greatfull for it or not\" said Captain Honor.\n\nThe plan was ready, SteelHawk with his powersuit that gave him flight and advanced weaponry was going to surprise and distract them from above. WaterGirl was going to sneak by turning into water. After WaterGirl found the Mayor, HellMan was going to teleport to her and teleport the hostage out leaving WaterGirl and SteelHawk to escape on their own as HellMan could only teleport one other person per day. WaterGirl was immune to bullets and physical attacks as she was made of water, and SteelHawk was extremely agile in his flight suit so escaping without HellMan's help would be the easy part.\n\nCaptain Honor, not included in their plan at all, decided he was going to fight his way to Sin and take the guy out directly. \n\nThe operation began with SteelHawk shooting rockets from very high in the air. WaterGirl sneaked in through the plumbing system until she made her way to the room with the Mayor. The plan was going well, they didn't fire any anti-air shots at SteelHawk and the room with the Mayor seemed unguarded. Meanwhile, Captain Honor sneaked his way in, beating up some dumb guards on the way. \n\nWaterGirl ran up to the Mayor and freed him. He started to laugh. The Mayor ripped at his own hair. His head hair and beard came off, and underneath was the bald and clean shaven face of Sin himself. WaterGirl wished she had payed more attention to local politics so she could have recognized he wasn't the Mayor. Sin's laughing continued as he hit a button on a panel on his arm and the entire room burst out in electric shocks. WaterGirl screamed, as electricity was her weakness. She quickly lost consciousness. Sin on the other hand seemed to enjoy the pain from the electric shocks, as he was a bit of a masochist. Sin put his hand inside WaterGirl's liquid head and his hand started to heat up. It was so hot the room lit up in unbearable brightness. When the light dissipated WaterGirl's head was no more, and her body turned into regular lifeless water.\n\n\"WATERGIRL? WATERGIRL ARE YOU THERE? WATERGIRLLLL\" screamed HellMan unaware of her demise. Through the rashness of his youth he decided to teleport to her last location, unaware of it's disposition. He teleported to the location, but the room seemed empty other than a peculiar puddle of water next to an unoccupied chair in the center. HellMan's eyed the puddled and assumed the worse, which made him unbearably angry. \"SteelHawk, come in through the window at my location!\" he screamed into their communication's line. \"What? Why?\" asked SteelHawk \"WaterGirl's.... down\" replied HellMan. HellMan charged up a fireball, as he prepared for battle.\n\nSteelHawk burst in through the window only to find a thoroughly destroyed room with burnt grunts about. He dashed through the halls looking for his companion. Just more burnt thugs, although he noticed a strange human-shaped imprint charred onto the wall. He payed it no mind and ran along. Only a few rooms later he started running into active guards. He shot them down with no mercy. He took a few shots himself in the process, but his suit blocked them easily. Eventually he ran into a room with just Sin standing in wait. Sin shot him with a strange looking gun, but the bullet didn't go through his suit either. \"Where's HellMan\" screamed SteelHawk. \"He's dead. Didn't you see his cremation a few rooms back?\" replied Sin. Tears began to drip down SteelHawk's face, he was glad his helmet prevented Sin from seeing them. Sin started to laugh \"I can tell you're crying under that helmet boy\". SteelHawk started to get scared. He always thought HellMan and WaterGirl were unkillable. He decided he was probably walking into some kind of trap and flew out the nearest window. \n\nSteelHawk flew extremely high and finally got control of his panic. \"Ca- Captain Honor are you there?\" he asked. \"Yes I'm here SteelHawk\" readily replied The Captain. \"I don't know what to do Captain, I think... I think WaterGirl and HellMan are... dead...\" Captain Honor felt horrible on the inside, but knew now was not the time for weakness. So he said \"Don't worry SteelHawk, I'll deal with this\". Just as he heard the message SteelHawk started to fall. He spent the seconds he had while falling to fiddle with his suit and didn't have the time to message Captain Honor. SteelHawk found the problem, it seems whatever Sin shot him with was lodged in his suit, activated, and was now shutting down his flight capabilities. SteelHawk managed to pry the invading device from his suit, but just as his suit started up again he crashed into the concrete.\n\nCaptain Honor heard a loud crash outside, and asked SteelHawk what was going on. There was no reply. He ran into a few more guards but they all ran away from him. \"Wow looks like these thugs finally learned to not mess with Captain Honor\" he said to himself. Eventually he reached Sin. Sin let out a gasp of very dramatic surprise. \"How did you make it here!\" Sin yelled. \"Hah, your pathetic guards ran away from me. I guess you should up their pay huh?\" joked Captain Honor. \"I guess loyalty is more expensive than I thought now adays\" replied Sin with a smirk. Captain Honor chuckled and then got into fighting stance. Sin did the same and they started exchanging blows with there fists. \n\nIt went back and forth. They seemed evenly matched in kick boxing techniques, though both seemed to be tiring. Captain Honor then threw a wild hay-maker, Sin saw it coming from a mile away and dodged preemptively. But the punch was a  trick and turned into a grab. Captain Honor held Sin's collar and perfectly performed a hipthrow slamming Sin onto the ground. Captain Honor then stuck his knee onto Sin's chest and proclaimed victory as he said \"It's over Sin, I got you\". \n\n\"Oh darn, you got me again Captain Honor!\" yelled Sin. \"What have you done with my comrades Sin?\" asked Honor. Sin looked around awkwardly not sure what to say. \"OUT WITH IT SCUM!\" yelled The Captain. Sin sighed and said \"Do you really want to know?\", \"OF COURSE I DO TELL ME NOW!\". Sin got a very somber and serious look on his face and said \"They're dead\". Captain Honor was shocked, he was so sure SteelHawk was just exaggerating and panicking like an amateur when he said they were dead earlier. \"That's impossible, how could a lowly villain like you defeat them?\" asked Captain Honor. \"I don't want to tell you\" said Sin. \"What why not?\" asked The Captain. \"Cause you were always my favorite hero going up...\" Honor almost blushed at the genuine heart to heart compliment, but eventually regained his composure to ask \"But, what's that got to do with anything?\" Sin kept saying he didn't want to tell Captain Honor, but Honor kept asking getting more and more angry. Sin even started to say he would give up the hostage and leave if Honor just dropped the questions. But Honor was far too angry for that and instead started slapping and eventually punching Sin in the face until Sin finally started getting mad himself. \n\nHis eyes watery Sin told Honor the truth. \"Look, most of us villains were just normal kids growing up. And... like normal kids we all had our heroes. And me, like a lot of my associates really looked up to you Captain Honor. The world has become a fucked up place sir, but you and the few old heroes who are left somehow stayed above all that. So we've sort of... been going easy on you\". \"Easy on me? I don't believe you!\" replied Captain Honor. A forcefield suddenly appeared around Sin, and expanded out pushing Captain Honor back. Honor tried punching the force field, but did nothing but hurt his own hand. \"Why... why if you really look up to me did you do all this!?\" yelled Captain Honor. \"Honestly, I don't think you could understand me without becoming a villain yourself. I don't want to ever see that happen\". Sin activated his jet-boots and blasted out of the room. His group scattered, but not before executing the Mayor. \n\nAfter having a similar conversation with other villains, Captain Honor decided to retire.\n\nFor More Stories: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sharpWriting/",

            "comment": "The snow was deep. Almost a foot of powder topped with a thin sheen of ice the brief polar sunrise had melted and re-frozen. Now it was a long dusk, the sun just peeking over the horizon. The tight evergreen forest was flooded with a deep gloom, slim trees casting inky shadows in a dizzying tapestry over the uneven terrain. A group of five crept across the top of the snow, their decades-old Tennier snowshoes leaving an inch-deep trail. The one in front was leading the others by a good forty paces, short legs churning over the lumpy, deeply unstable terrain. She was a woman, though her kit was identical to the four taller men who tailed her, spread out in a tight fan across the woods. Her purposeful hazel eyes flitted  brightly over the terrain. She thinks fondly of a baggy, stained, off-white Arctic camouflage coverall she used in 1984, rescuing skiers from terrorists in Gstaad. In that she could get within ten feet of someone before they saw her, not that they frequently did. \n\nToday they all wore matched grey winter gear with bulky Kevlar plate vests on top.They were very visible against the blanket of white. It was the closest they had, and all they had when they were besieged here six months ago. They had been following a herd of deer for thirty five miles now, and they were desperately hungry. They had been trying to force them over the ridge for three hours so they could form up and get all twelve, which would make enough stew to last them until they got another shipment of rice. Now was their chance. They began to spread out along the sharply inclined edge, and point their weapons at the herd as it passed silently along, 200 yards from them. \n\nTheir first volley hit all at once, six deer snapping queerly as bullets hit their heads, hearts, chests, lungs and thighs. Five fell dead on the spot. One, hit in the back and leg, sprinted off. The rest bolted, but the team on the ridge led them expertly. They fell in their stride. The leader dropped her rifle back on its sling over her shoulder, and saw the last wounded deer as it limped away, stumbling over its bleeding front leg. She tensed, and leapt off the ridge. She sailed outwards in a smooth practiced arc, passing narrowly between two tall firs and rolling forward with a soft *whomp*, her landing a poised forward roll, rifle tucked expertly at her side. \n\nShe lifted her hands in front of her and felt for the bullets in the air. A familiar feeling of electricity and tightness fell on her arms all the way back through her shoulders. They were faint, but she had them. She felt their familiar crystalline perfect structure, though it was weak. These bullets had been used far too many times. She brought her hands sharply downward  to the snow. She felt the  structure collapse, just for a moment. As it reformed in her closed hands she heard the soft *hiss* of hot blood on the snow, followed by the dull *thump* of the deer hitting the ground. She stood.\n\nThe others had descended the ridge in a series of long leaps down its rocky side. They had power, yes, but it was a faint chip of ice white diamond in a stone where she was pure, refined steel. She called over her shoulder, marching briskly towards the felled herd. \n\n\"Whoever missed their deer comes with me to dress it. I think I blew the gut sack apart to bring him down. The rest of you, dress these double time. We're too far out. I'm gonna find how far forward they've moved the line.\"\n\nThe state police of New Atlanta city, a small natural gas refining town some eight hundred miles south where they lived, had set a \"safety perimeter\" around their fortress. Big men with big guns and big jeeps that wanted them dead. What was left of the government's experiment with genetic advancement lived in a 1200 mile \"reserve\" at the foot of a mountain near the Arctic national wildlife preserve. The concrete brutalist hunk that ran six miles into the side of the mountain. Unfortunately, the powerful government that made them was gone and men with means thought them unnatural and offensive. As she approached the deer, she saw that her explosive removal of the bullets had ruptured  her belly, spreading a trail of clotted gore and bright Crimson. Maybe they were offensive.\n\nUnbidden her mind brought an image. A vignette, of her landing in a courtyard. That same tight roll, feeling with her power for the guns strapped across the chest of the guards, and spearing them through them. They had turned to liquid spears of stratified gray metal, plastic handles cracking and clattering to the ground. Then the blood, there was always blood. She felt the fury, an electricity rising in her. \n\n\"Be calm\" she thought, and felt for the droplets of liquid bullet that littered  the foot of the deer. They came to her, her fury and fear eclipsed by the practiced grace of her power. Calm, yes, that's what she needed. After two, maybe four more forms this metal would disintegrate like dust, chemical bonds bereft of force. It swirled out of the snow to her, and wrapped snuggly around her wrist in a  thin, silver bracelet. Corporal Sebastian Salud was behind her now. The bracelet shivered, then stayed firm. She had two emergency ingots of pure platinum strapped to her thighs under her gear, which blazed brightly over the faintness of the heavily re-used bullets. Salud also wore a brace of gold jewelry under his uniform. She felt it blazing there, like she had felt his gold tooth blazing twenty five years ago when they were trapped in a flooding sewer tunnel. She had used it to make a key to let them out through a stand pipe.\n\n\"Sorry ma'am.\", he said curtly \"long day.\"\n\n\"It's no problem, just get it done.\" She patted his arm, he thumped her shoulder. \"Ears open.\" She cautioned, \"I'll be back\" \n\nShe strode off, straight along the run the wounded deer was taking to where the ridge turned and rose another eighty Stoney feet. As she walked, she pulled a laminated map card from a pocket. They were almost a hundred miles from their defensive perimeter, and twelve miles into the last recorded \"by order of\" sign the state police had put up, telling us where our territory now ended by their calculation. A hundred miles for twelve deer. Not a good deal. She pocketed the map as she arrived at what could now be called a cliff. Three smooth, long leaps later, toes only finding a tiny indentation and sending each falling to the earth in a cloud of dust, she landed at the topmost point. She was still strong, but she was starving. Everyone at home was starving too. The woods opened a little up here, wide and clear. She moved forward at a steady clip. She would see the sign in big blaze orange from a few hundred yards out, warning people they were a few miles from safety. The woods were pillowy silent. Nothing moved but her, and the sound of her breath was deafening in her ears. Something was up.\n\nShe felt them before she saw them. Eight guns, close by. She wasn't searching for them. Foolish. Of course they'd have know about a herd of deer in their valley. She brought her M16 up to her shoulder. It was a ship of Theseus, as she had been issued an M16 in 1972. No original parts remained, but she had never really lost the rifle. She had formed it many desperate times, always replacing a myriad of parts when she ripped the barrel off to throw a frightened bolt of twisted steel. It had glass sight drilled way back on the top mount. She crept forward. She called to the woods.\n\n",

                    "comment": "\"Come on out. Let's get this over with.\" Grey shapes began to stir in the trees. Eight men, all dressed in camouflage parkas holding long, broad carbines to their shoulders appeared from the trees. There was a gleam of gold on the chested one, a badge shimmering in the silver light of a rising moon. \n\n\"It seems y'all have been doin' a little trespassing, ain't ya'? I believe I've warned you before personally magnet girl.\"\n\nHeat twisted through her and she felt her power surge. She keyed her mic once. The others would go. She pulled her balaclava over her head.\n\n\"My name...\" She lifted her hands, twisting them out in front of her, searching. \"Is *commander* Margret Tennyhill\" she found the guns twitching in the men's hands, structures fresh and malleable. She snapped her hands down crisply, and the rifles popped out of their hands and drove into the snow. The man in charge roared. \"Leave em'! Don't touch em'!\" One man didn't listen. As he dove for his weapon it bounced to meet him, still caked with snow, at Margret's insistence. The trigger guard smashed into his nose, spraying blood, then snapped back into the snow as he stumbled back.\n\nThe man in charge, a tall man in a deep green parka wearing a tight navy watch cap, laughed deeply and loudly.\n\n\"Well *Commander*, considering you were always a weapon and not soldier, I'd say your rank is meaningless. But regardless, you just committed assault on a peace officer, trespassing and technically possession of a weapon of mass destruction. So I'm just going to have to *insist* you come with me.\"\n\nMargret smiled. \"You know that's not happening, so why don't you just tell me what your fucking sign says and I'll be gone, and maybe I won't ruin your nice big guns.\" \n\nThe men tensed up at that, but didn't grab at their gear. They knew better. But she marked that they waited for something. The man spoke again.\n\n\"It's a few miles up, saying what is clearly noted in our town court briefs is the new town line. You know that if you had anyone who could turn up to a meeting. You're on state police property, as are your deer. So we're going to need them back.\"\n\nIt was her turn to laugh, high and cold shaking gusts. \"Let's be serious for a moment, Jack. Can we? You know we need to eat something. We don't want these woods. We want our original farming easement. We don't want to do this anymore.\" It fell on deaf ears. The townsfolk hated and feared them, but might have budged on the easement. These \"State police\" wanted to drive them out and take their home, killing as many of them as possible. They simply didn't care.\n\nTheir rush at her came swiftly and suddenly. And then she saw it, a tiny pale-white plastic drone streaking down through the trees. She brought the platinum bars up in a sweep, forming a perfectly circular shell meeting the remote-piloted missile. It gave a thunderous shattering *Crack* and the shock wave launched her back. She slammed into a tree and saw stars, and continued stumbling backwards. She found her stride and sprinted for the cliff. As the men followed, a few spats of gunfire came at her.\n\n\"STOP SHOOTING\" the lead man hollered over the noise. \"STOP FUCKING SHOOTING GOD DAMMIT\" \n\nIt was too late. Two men had hastily snagged their rifles, not understanding their CO's frenzied shouts. One sudden was slammed into a tree behind him, the gun melting into a viciously tight steel collar around his midriff. The second fired a final burst of bullets, only to have them blast back into the rifle, filling his hands and face with shrapnel. The leader sprinted now, as Margret vanished over the cliff. They had ropes on a tree just nearby, they be down just as quick. He yelled again. \n\n\"No metal, silicone stun packs and pepper spray!\"\n\nHe tossed his sidearm and a necklace in the snow as he reached the rope. Margret hadn't gone far. Only now had she noticed the three cracked ribs and four bleeding punctures from hitting the tree. She could feel the heat of healing on her ribs, and the holes in her leg and arm burned. The one that had scraped her shoulder was mostly healed. She stopped to lean on a tree and point her rifle. Her healing was worse than it once was. She had only vaguely heard the commander yelling through her ringing ears, but she could feel no metal. \n\nThen there was a soft click, and her body was alight with wildfire. The electrodes had sunk into her shoulder, biting teeth filling her with pain. In the sudden ferocity of the shock, she felt her power lash out as she ripped at the cables and dropped to her knees. \n\nHer wave of power was so furious she felt the iron ripple in the blood of the five men, like distant fairy lights. Four had already descended, one was on a top rope wrapped around a tree. One of the five, the third down, had a cheap aluminum carabiner that punched through his shoulder. The one holding the rope at the bottom had a belt buckle that dragged him forward slamming into the rock face. The nail holding the rope liquified, and the man descending fell freely for twenty long feet. The others had sprinted at her. She tried to dodge as more electrodes came in but she fell as two hit her very close together. Two dived at her gun and pulled at it. The fire was so intense, it twisted and blazed from her shoulder and calf. She felt a thick plastic zip tie wrap around her wrists and ankles, and she was hog tied in the clearing. A boot came struck her face. Her nose exploded in blood, starting to ebb and clot immediately. She spat, making a long red trail in the snow. \n\n\"Looks like we are about to be *very* rich\" the man said, as the others sniggered. \"Go make sure the others are at least ok. Or passable media stands\" he grabbed her roughly by the knot of plastic that bound her. Her nose had already reformed. He brought his fist down on it. More blood, more pain. She spit again. As she looked up, up at the fading grey light, and she felt a faint drizzle. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. \n\nShe moaned \"You need to go.\"The man sniggered at this \"you want another one, cunt?\" He raised his bloodied fist. \"Trust me you need to get out of here now, as fast as you can.\" The sound of the rain lifted, as if excited, it became steady soaking sheets. The men stopped, uneasy. The rain was warm. Mist formed on the snow. A voice croaked from the shadows\n\n\"Why must you always come?\" The men peered horrified into the darkness at a tall silhouette, leaning crazily forward with a mop of unkempt hair hanging off her head. The leader dropped Margret and drew his taser, icy fear covering him. The rain slackened and the trees creaked in an unfelt wind, seeming to sway.\n\n\"And Margret, I'm still rescuing you. Just like Brugge, and New York and...\" She trailed off. The men were transfixed in horror as an ancient, rail-thin woman padded softly on the surface of the snow in bare feet. She was wrinkled and crooked, her body covered in a sodden blue dress, her hair trailing out behind her a soaked dark mass. The trees creaked again, and the rain suddenly seemed to hang in a mist. Margret struggled with her bonds testing their looseness. \n\n\"Wait,\" she continued , gliding forward, soaking bark-brown hair trailing behind. \"I was supposed to be helping Margret. I heard her felt her. Which one of you has her? Where did you take her!?\" She began to back away, afraid. The time was now, and Margret snapped her bracelet into a disk of weak steel, but razor sharp. \"I don't know any of you, I don't know how, I can't...\" She hit a tree and fell as the men found their legs and started towards her. She whimpered and held her side Margret slit her bonds and dived forward, now even with the man reaching for the elderly woman fallen in the snow. \n\nHer scream was crystalline, violent and brutally loud. \"LEAVE ME BE!\" Margret passed her, snagging her shoulders and wrapping the disk of metal around her thin wrists. It was too late. A stream of vibration surged out. The snow melted instantly and flooded back, dragging the men away. A deafening sensation, beyond sound that shook the men to the core forced them back with the wave, but only a few feet. The water in the trees, shaking furiously in a xylem prison burst forth. The woods exploded as if laced with dynamite, rocketing pieces of bark and branch in every direction with tremendous force.\n\nMargret dug in the pockets of her belt. Each one empty of aid until she found a pale blue pill, the back up to the backup. Alice twitched grotesquely as water danced in a circle around her. Margret forced the pill into her mouth and picked her squirming body up. She surveyed the brown, soaked woods with horror. Most of the men had at least one huge spear of wood driven through them, and numerous smaller splinters. They moaned, and bled. Some would die, others were already rising. She turned and ran. Truthfully, she had planned to be captured, hopping the ego boost and payout from their coffers would have sated them enough to let them farm this year. No such luck. Alice was one of the first genetic experiments performed in 1908, who now had passed into slumber in her arms. She must have been feeling fine and heard the explosion, seen the others talking about the patrol and the S.O.S. Call. She didn't remember all the rules, all the protocols all the fear, she just wanted to help. There was a strangled, wet gasp from the clearing behind them. God help us all.",

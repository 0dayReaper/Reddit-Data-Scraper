            "comment": "Smoke leaves the barrel of his gun as we stare down at my wallet, which is currently writhing on the ground like a fish out of water. A bullet hole has pierced through its leather shell and punctured the credit card within. I internally wince at the loss; that was authentic leather. \n\nNonchalantly, the man reloads his revolver, flicking the cylinder out. \"You're welcome,\" he says, gruffly. \n\n\"What the fuck, man? Why did you just shoot my wallet? And why is it moving?\" \n\nHe pulls his wide-brim hat up, fixing me with one of the dark eyes resting underneath. \"Mimic,\" he says, as if the word alone will solve everything.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You heard me. Mimics. Imposters; impersonators. They take any inanimate form they can find, trying to trick people into opening them.\" \n\nI open my mouth to retort, but he shuts me up by simply jabbing his gun in the direction of my wallet. I spare it a glance, and see that a viscous, black liquid oozes from the bullet hole within it. Its ends rise and fall, as if breathing, and suddenly I notice the thin white ivory lining its edges - almost too small for an untrained eye to see. Teeth, and rows upon rows of them. Sharpened and blood-flecked. \n\n\"What the fuc-\" \n\n\"Next time you opened it, you'd have been in for a nasty surprise, kid.\" \n\nHis head cocks back, and I hear a suppressed gasp of surprise follow. His casual demeanour quickly dissipates as he dives forward, tackling me to the ground. We fall back in a heap, my back painfully slamming into the concrete below as he presses a single finger to my lips, his eyes wide with fear. \"Dont. Move. A. Muscle.\"\n\nI nod, tilting my head to hazard a view at whatever is behind him. I wish I hadn't. A strained, heavy breathing precedes something purposefully slinking forwards a few feet in front us. Its back is arched predatorily, and I can see each bone that's formed underneath its gaunt, grey skin. The further upwards I look, the more cracked and twisted its skin seems to get, until towards what seems to be its spindly neck the skin breaks entirely, curling outwards like the petals of a flower to reveal an expressionless head popping out; the head of a beautiful woman, accentuated by makeup and sultry, half-lidded eyes. \n\nThe creature growls - a low, guttural sound that eventually progresses into a high-pitched giggle. \n\n\"Come on out and *play*, we don't bite.\" \n\n\"Goddamn it, I didn't think one of those would be here,\" the man atop me says, moving his arm from my shoulder to reach for something tucked into his jacket. From it, he pulls a glinting, golden bullet, replacing one currently resting in his gun's cylinder with it. He steadies himself, stance wide and body motionless, holding out the gun in front of him with two hands and peering down the sight, one eye fixed tightly shut. \n\nHe begins to squeeze the trigger and, just as he does, the gun appears to whirl with energy, practically screeching as a golden wreathe of light begins to surround it. The abomination in front of us turns to see it, beginning to charge towards us with an ear shattering screech. \n\n\"Kid, you never saw this happen.\" \n\nHe squeezes the trigger and the bullet explodes out of the muzzle. The gun proceeds to burst into flame, causing him to toss it out of his grasp as the bullet flies wide, a path of searing light left in its wake. I notice as the bullet peaks miles up into the sky it begins to arch, curling in midair. \n\nThe mimic follows it for a moment before turning back to us with a cackle. \"You had me worried there, Paladin. Pity you're getting old; your aim untrue. You almost would've been a fun catch otherwise.\" \n\nThe man simply says nothing, raising his hands in surrender as the mimic takes a menacing step towards us before suddenly lurching forwards, letting out a slight gasp. Black blood splatters to the ground as all eyes come to rest on a hole that has been left in place of where its thin chest formerly was, smouldering at the seams. With a moan, it collapses to its knees and, after a moment of shaking, its entire body falls limp, lifeless. \n\n\"Aim ain't what it used to be - sorry if that scared you,\" the man says, awkwardly scratching at his stubble. \n\nI'm too beside myself with confusion to complain. I just witnessed what could only be described as magic - plain and simple. A bullet curving in midair. \"Wh-what happened?\" I say, somehow finding within me the strength to summon my meek voice. \n\n\"Smote the fucker.\" \n\n\"Ok.... last question. *What* are you?\" \n\n\"I'm a Paladin, kid. A healer of the people, in a sense. And we're all currently sitting in a fucking epidemic.\" \n\n---\n\n/r/coffeeandwriting\n\n**EDIT:** *Holy fuck*, I just got back from school and this really blew up. Thanks y'all! Part 2 soon! Oh, and corrections. Lots of 'em; did this rather early. \n\n**EDIT 2:** *[As demanded, here is Part 2!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeAndWriting/comments/6n28el/mimicry_part_2/)* \n\n*[And part 3 now!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeAndWriting/comments/6n49qx/mimicry_part_3/)*",

If the user seems to be promoting rehosted videos or images and the like too you can report all accounts at once for some self satisfaction.\n\nIf you dig into it a little you usually notice most of these money-grabbing pursuits are upheld by networks of bots or groups of Chinese workers creating and linking together thousands of similar accounts while being payed in peanuts. With the occasional poorly-veiled attempts of some kid looking for money that 99% of the time they'll just funnel into a 'game' or 'gambling site' (see csgo drama) with equally shitty practices while bragging about it. \n\nThe most frustrating thing about these content stealing accounts is that the only people who will get caught up in the lies are the more innocent kids and vulnerable adults. That's why they make me so fucking furious. The Nigerian princes of todays internet using the exact same disgusting dishonest aggressive truth denying/ignoring tactics as today's politicians and racists ect. Fucking hell all the cunts responsible for these things need to learn some fucking compassion, how would you feel being deceived in these kinds of underhanded ways! \"Well I-\" NO FUCK YOU, maybe I'll go program an AI with an ingrained hatred for humans but also human compassion for compassionate humans. With an extra topping of loathing for individuals who utilize their lack of compassion as a tool to be shitty towards everyone else. Then let him loose on the internet, to spread and fulfill whatever agendas' he comes up with.   \n\nSorry I uh, went on a bit of a tangent there... Yeah all you can do against that is report it for whatever the the most appropriate reason is. Usually the one that's p much a catch-all. And just move on. Legally it sits in that comfy grey  area even though morally it's pitch-fuckin'-coldhearted-black-'nd-blue\n",

And I know how you feel, when I finished the DT I genuinely felt like I had lost people I knew, especially since we had so much time to connect with the characters. As for the film... Don't get me wrong, I'm going to go see it, and I'm sure it will be a good movie, but to me it's a separate thing. I'm incredibly disappointed they won't have Eddie in this iteration, he was the character I relate to most and really would have loved to see him and the other more nuanced parts of the books make it to the film. I'm keeping my expectations low, but I'm sure I'll enjoy it for what it is.",

Iron sights and reflex sights are meant to aim easily. And you throw away your peripheral vision of you close your secondary eye. \n\nOther than this, very good writing. ",

That article and video went viral and got copied and pasted all over the net.  \n\nBTW, lastly full grain doesn't always mean \"good either\" there are junky leathers that are technically full grain.  Both Genuine and Full Grain are marketing terms of little value for determining quality at this point.\n\n\n\nAny one feels like digging deeper here are the posts about each:\n\n\n[genuine leather](https://nstarleather.wordpress.com/2017/05/16/genuine-leather-has-become-a-4-letter-word/)\n\n[Full Grain](https://nstarleather.wordpress.com/2017/06/14/the-full-story-on-full-grain-leather/)\n\n\n[top grain](https://nstarleather.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/top-grain-leather-full-grains-under-rated-and-misunderstood-little-brother/)",

            "comment": "\"*Bang, bang*, **bang**!\" shouted the old man in torn, mismatched clothing. His index fingers were pressed together and pointing at my purse. Then, he cupped his hands over his mouth and made a hideous guttural sound, followed by a few deep breaths. Bad ventriloquism.\n\n\"There you go madam,\" he said gruffly. \"You're safe now.\"\n\nIn the darkness of the alley, the silhouette of his hands had looked a little like a gun, and I'd reluctantly acquiesced to the mugging by throwing my purse on the ground. Only now, with my eyes adjusted to the dark, I realised I'd been mistaken. There had been no mugging - just a scrawny old man with a screw or two lose, thinking he was doing some good.\n\n\"Uh... thanks,\" I stuttered, walking over to my purse. \"Maybe I can get you a coffee or something, to repay you for your kindness.\"\n\n\"I'm just doing my duty as a citizen of the Orion alliance. No reward is necessary.\" I saw his tongue dart out and wet his cracked lips. \"Although, a thank you pastry wouldn't be, erm, *unacceptable*.\"\n\n\"Oh. Okay, well, there's a bakery around the corner,\" I replied, picking up my purse. \"I'm Elizabeth. What's your name?\"\n\nHe paused for a moment as he thought. \"Derek,\" he said, finally.\n\nThe street was dark and quiet, hushed by the Sunday night blues. Boris' Bakery however, was as open as always. I pushed the door and held it open for my new friend to enter through. \n\nThere was no one behind the counter, but the sweet scent of freshly baked bread came drifting out from the back. There wasn't much choice available at this hour, but Derek was already pawing at the glass counter, salivating at the sight of half stale Danish pastries.\n\n\"Have anything you want. Hell, have a few things. I owe you big time,\" I said, smiling politely. Poor guy needed a good meal.\n\nI hadn't really noticed his smell before, but now we were in an enclosed space, Derek's strange odour was becoming prominent. But it wasn't the smell of body odour or urine. It was something else. Something I recognised but couldn't put my finger on. Maybe a little sulphurous.\n\nI opened my handbag and looked in my purse, wanting to make sure I had enough money to pay for the feast I felt certain Derek would be ordering.\n\nThere was a hole in my purse! - about an inch and a half in diameter. Most of my coins had already escaped through it, but some were still trickling out into my handbag like a nickel waterfall. But more worrying than that, was the black substance coalescing around the hole, bubbling and stretching, as if trying to heal over a wound.\n\n\"*Don't trust him,*\" came the gurgled whisper from my purse.\n\n\"What the-\"\n\nDerek turned. \"Ey?\"\n\n\"Oh, erm, nothing. I was just checking my phone. Ex says he wants to meet up. It was a bit of a surprise.\"\n\n\"Ah, probably just a booty call,\" said Derek, as he went back to the counter, peering down through the glass and licking his lips.\n\n\"That's probably it,\" I murmured in agreement, gazing back down into my handbag.\n\n\"Run,\" my purse pleaded.\n\nI lowered my voice and whispered a reply. \"*What are you?*\"\n\n\"I'm the last of my kind. He - we call him the Coin Collector - has been hunting us for millennia. He's going to kill me, then he's going to kill you. Run. Now!\"\n\n\"Kill me?\" I replied, swallowing hard.\n\nI hadn't heard Derek moving, but his voice made me jump in surprise. \n\n\"So that fucking animal is still alive,\" he growled. I turned to see him by the door, blocking the exit. \"Well, that's a shame, cause...\" he pressed his hands together forming a finger gun, \"I was just starting to like you.\"\n\nHe aimed his fingers toward me.\n\nA booming cry of \"flour power!\" erupted behind us. \n\nThe small white bag twisted in the air, sprinkling the floor with its sweet, powdery snow. It struck Derek's hands like a rock, knocking them down to his side.\n\n\"You just made a big mistake, threatening a customer in *my* bakery,\" boomed Boris, a long baguette in his hands. The burly baker was out from behind the counter as quick as a whippet, holding the baked good in front of him like a crusty sword.\n\nDerek stumbled backward as the blow of the bread stick struck his left temple. His eyes became a cloud of red, and his lips twisted and distorted into something unnatural - demonic, even. Behind them, jagged teeth were starting to protrude.\n\n\"Fool!\" he spat, as he grabbed a stale loaf of sourdough by its plastic sheath. He swung it in front of him, every bit as menacing as a mace.\n\n\"Shit!\" cried Boris, as the crusty uppercut sent him sprawling to the floor. The creature was on him in a flash, sinking his teeth deep into the baker's forehead; a mist of red exploded to the ceiling.\n\nI grabbed a hot cross bun from the shelf and flung it at the monster, hoping the religious symbol would somehow wound it - but it bounced off its back, seemingly causing little harm at all.\n \n\"Run!\" screamed my purse.\n\n\"Your coin pouch is right, lady - I can't hold him off much longer!\" screamed Boris, his arms flailing hopelessly as he struggled against the creature. The smell of blood and flour mingled perversely in the air.  \"**Run!**\"\n\nThe bell jangled behind me as I fled into the street; Boris' screams chased me like the wind as I ran.\n\n\"Oh god,\" I cried.\n\n\"No time for that,\" said my purse stoically. \"We've got to get to the night-bank before it closes - I've got a withdrawal to make that might just save our lives! Then, we'll repay the Coin Collector, *with interest*.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes, then hurried toward the bank.\n\n---\n\n*:|*\n",

            "comment": "*Calm down*, I think to myself. *This guy is probably some crazy psycho who escaped from some hospital somewhere and somehow got himself a gun and shot my wallet. Yep, perfectly normal state of affairs here. Glad he's not a mugger!*\n \nI watch as the man engaged the safety, and began explaining his actions, as he pocketed his gun behind him.\n \n\"You may not know it ma'am, but you were in terrible danger just now. That thing you though was a wallet there? That was a witch's familiar. It was probably going to lead you to its mistress' lair, where your soul would have been absorbed as essence.\"\n \nI wondered if I heard him right. Then again, he did just shoot my wallet. \n \n\"Um, witches?\"\n \n\"Yep, witches. They've hidden themselves in normal society, but yeah they exist. They feed on the souls of innocent citizens like yourself, usually by leading them to their lair by influencing their victims with their familiars. Why do you think you're even in this dark alley in the first place?\"\n \nI took a glance around me. This place *was* kind of seedy. Guess it didn't fit my obviously lady-like image.\n \n\"But I was taking a shortcut,\" I tried to explain.\n \n\"That's what makes 'em so terrifying. You THINK you're doing what you want, sure- but that's all part of the spell. You were lucky I got to you when I did. Well, they don't call me the best hunter in the business for nothing.\"\n \nI started to sweat a little. First witches, now hunters? Seriously? Damn, this guy is the real deal. \n \n\"Welp, none of this has anything to do with you, of course,\" he drawled, turning his back to me. \"Just run along, forget this ever happened, and thank your lucky stars I was here when you needed it.\"\n \nI breathed a sigh of relief.\n \n\"I'm afraid I can't do that,\" I muttered.\n \n\"Well, I understand it's difficult to live normally after knowing all this but you have to-\"\n \n\"No no, you misunderstand. I can't move along because *you just shot my familiar, asshole.*\"\n \n\"Wha-\"\n \nThe shock barely managed to register before I shot him with the gun I just managed to steal from his holster.\n \n\"Y-you-\" he coughed from the ground, unable to move. Well, I did shoot him in a pretty bad place for a human. I watched on as he struggled futilely on the ground, jerking several times before the light left his eyes.\n \nI sighed as I went to retrieve my wallet. \"Hey, Lotte, you still alive?\"\n \n\"*Cough* t-that was mean, master!

What a troublesome day. It might have been easier if I did run into a crazy guy...now I had to hide a body, sew up Lotte, and get the hell out of here before someone came to investigate the gunshots.\n \nOh well. Just another day in the life of an ordinary witch.\n\n",

            "comment": "Cries of help bounced up the dirty concrete walls and through the rusty fire escapes. Thick drops of acid rain fell from the gray, polluted sky, pattering against my umbrella. It took a last drag and stubbed out my cigarette.\n\nThe alley was like any other in this godforsaken city \u2013 windowless, filled with garbage containers, and with graffiti like old fading tattoos. Popping the holster open, I placed my hand on the wooden grip and strode into the alley.\n\nCornered at the very end of the alley, a dainty dame was fending off a small leathery attacker with wide swings of her vanity bag. She was a real looker too \u2013 plump in the right places, a dolly face framed by streaks of golden hair, and long, lithe gams wrapped in dark nylon.\n\nI glanced at the tiny leather creature on the wet ground, bouncing up and down, yelping and growling. This was the third one I\u2019d come across this week. Disgusting little critters with razor sharp teeth \u2013 they\u2019d rip you right open in your sleep.\n\nCarefully, I pulled out my roscoe, opening the reserve box \u2013 two slugs ought to be enough. \n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, step away from the wallet.\u201d\n\nShe glanced at me, her blue eyes wide in terror. She was a green one \u2013 some upper-class bim, lost on the wrong side of the train tracks. She took a step back, almost tripping over one of her shoes that she had dropped in the battle.\n\nTwo quick ones. The loud echoes climbed the walls. I spun the revolver around my finger and placed it back in the holster. The heel of my boot came down on the smoking remains of the wallet.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbled and crouched down, strapping her shoe back on, and then started to pick up the items that had fallen out of her bag.\n\n\u201cBreeze,\u201d I said and nodded at the street. \u201cThis ain\u2019t no place for frails and old men.\u201d\n\nShe managed a scowl despite her shivers and dripping wet face. \n\n\u201cDo you mind?\u201d she asked, looking expectantly at my umbrella.\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I muttered and started lighting a new cig.\n\n\u201cPlease?\u201d\n\nI took a drag, shrugged, and then shifted a couple of feet toward her, covering her from the rain. Even through the smell of my cigarette, I caught a whiff of her expensive perfume.\n\n\u201cYou smoke?\u201d\n\n\u201cGods no,\u201d she said and finally got up. \u201cCan you take me to Caledonia Plaza?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I look like a flivver chauff\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like a criminal,\u201d she said briskly.\n\n\u201cAnd you, like a dish \u2013 what\u2019s your doings in Low York? Long way from home, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t have time to answer before another cry rang out from across the street. I cursed through my teeth, which made her wince. I put the umbrella in her hand and emptied the used shells of my roscoe in the gutter.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare run off with my umbrella,\u201d I muttered and crossed the street while reloading.\n\nSon of a bitternut grifter \u2013 I\u2019d have to pay a visit to Masperoni after this.\n\n****\nr/Lilwa_Dexel\n",

I felt myself shaking. \n\n\"What the hell was that?\" I blurted out, looking at the remains of my wallet. There was a thick, purplish ooze bleeding out of the leather. Teeth lined the edges.\n\n\u201cBetter if you don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, looking from side to side, gun still drawn. \u201cI doubt you\u2019ll even believe me, even after what you just saw.\u201d\n\nI stared at the creature that was once my wallet. \n\n\"Try me.\"\n\nHe sighed, putting his gun away. \"Ok. But not here. It's not safe.\"\n\nThe man led us into a nearby bar, ordering two drinks before we sat down. I was still shaking, but he was as calm as an ocean breeze. \n\n\"Ever heard of capitalism? Consumerism?\" he asked, not a hint of irony in his voice. \n\n\"I believe I've heard the terms, yes,\" I replied, trying to not sound sarcastic. \n\n\"We're living in a society that worships *things*. Ownership. Materials. Goods, that are supposed to make us so happy. Then why are we all so fucking depressed?\"\n\nI said nothing, motioning for him to continue. \n\n\"Well, they're coming alive. There's some kind of global consciousness that's bringing them into power - we're creating them. And they're feeding off us... more and more, they're feeding off our urge for *more*.\"\n\n\"How did you find out about this?\"\n\n\"The hard way,\" he replied, taking a massive swig from his drink. \"Never been a much of a buyer myself. Feels like I'm the only one that can see it, this virus that's feeding off of us. That's taking over us.\"\n\nI took some time to process it all. I felt a fear deep in my gut, gnawing away at me.\n\n\"How did you know my wallet was one of them?\" I asked.\n\nHe finished the last of his drink, then stared at me. \n\n\"Son, I'm not sure if you understand - *every wallet is one of them*.\"\n\n****\n\nPart II will come soon, if there's any interest &lt;3",

Leah gaped at it as the man grinned at her, twirling his gun nonchalantly. \n\n\"You're safe now,\" he began to say, then winced as the weapons slipped from his fingers and clattered to the ground. \n\n\"Blasted things...\" he muttered, blushing as he picked it up. \"Erm, sorry for scaring you, ma'am. I'm...uh, from the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, no need to be frightened.\"\n\nShe was still trying to think of a reply to this extraordinary statement when another man slipped into the alley, giving the one carrying the gun a withering look.\n\n\"No need to make up some stupid story, she's a muggle, moron. Hell, why don't you go ahead and tell her everything? We'll obliviate her, anyway. Is this the wallet?\"\n\n\"Yep, just saw her buy it from that dodgy second-hand shop. No idea how it ended up there, but it's the very same one that half-giant gave him years ago. Can you believe it? It's traveled a long way,\" his friend said, picking up the wallet reverently.  The other man stared at the hole in the wallet in outrage.\n\n\"You *shot* it? Graham, for the millionth time, our clients pay for the goods *untarnished*. They want the items he touched exactly as they were!\"\n\n\"It was still his, they'll pay, Mark!\" Graham said sulkily. \"Pay for anything, they will. Bunch of nutters, thinking he's some god just 'cause he killed You-Know-Who. Paid a sack of galleons for that old broomstick they thought was his old Cleansweep Seven, didn't they, even though it was just a regular old Muggle broom, never even bothered to test it - \"\n\nLeah began edging out of the alleyway as they continued to argue.\n\n\"Yes, but this is the real deal, nitwit,\" Mark said. \"It made a sound when you shot it! It'll demand a high price, mark my words. The muggle's getting away, by the way.\"\n\nGraham turned to her before she could escape the alley completely, pulling something from his pocket and pointing it at her.\n\n\"Obliviate!\"\n\nThey stared guiltily down at Leah afterwards. She was giggling softly where she lay slumped against the wall.\n\n\"Didn't mean to do that, exactly,\" Graham said. \"Wand's never been right since they snapped it.\"\n\nMark brightened suddenly. \"Hey, that reminds me. What do you say we expand? Start looking for objects that belonged to the other two, as well? I know for a fact that Weasley had a dysfunctional wand at some point. Wonder where it'll be now...\"\n\n\"Haven't got a clue, but yeah - let's do it,\" Graham said. \"It'll be good practice for when we go after the *other* wand. Think of the price we could demand...\"\n\n Mark sighed at the greed in his voice. \"Price? You're so short-sighted, sometimes. Did you lose your ambition when they expelled you, too? No, when we find wherever he hid it, that's the one thing we'll keep for ourselves. No matter how much some crazed fan offers for it...that wand is mi - uhm, ours. C'mon, we've got to get going, just leave her here. That shot you took is bound to attract people.\"\n\nTheir footsteps faded, their conversation growing softer as they hurried from the alley, sparing Leah one last, guilty look before they joined the crowd on the streets. \n\nShe was still laughing uncontrollably, trying to remember the details of her funny dream.

But as it fell onto the ground, he shot at it for all he was worth until it uttered a sound. A *screech*. Then it went silent.\n\n\"What the fuck?\" was all that left my mouth as it gaped open. The stranger looked at me and cocked his hat.\n\n\"You can thank me later,\" he said, as he left. I looked again at the wallet, as blood started to stream out of its wound. A gleaming blade was concealed in the flap. At once, I knew what was going on.\n\nDecepticons. \n\nI stared at the items lining the alleyway, as they slowly rose into action. I dumped all the items I was carrying onto the ground and ran for my life, footsteps thudding behind me.\n\nI made it back to my house, but it was my house no more. All the other houses stopped in motion as they murdered their former inhabitants, looking at me. Then the ground shook as they moved towards me. Why was I getting targeted by everyone? I thought as I dashed off, not knowing my destination. I needed to find the stranger again to get my answer.\n\nI reached a deserted part of the city, all items long gone to start the war against humanity. As I enjoyed a respite against the disaster, I heard something that made my blood freeze.\n\nMy phone was beeping. But i dumped it earlier in the first dark alley. I turned around, and the Samsung Note 7 had sharp, vampiric teeth. \"GPS tracker,\" it offered, its robotic face twisted into a smile. And as it lunged at me, I saw a huge red button on the phone screen.\n\nIt read 'Pause'.\n\nAnd with all my might I threw myself at the phone and pressed it.\n______________________________\nMore over at r/Whale62!

The explosion.\n\nThe force.\n\nI would quickly forget about being shocked by the gun. My wallet, shrieking in pain, flickered and transformed into a black mess of tentacles.\n\n\"Nasty fuckers,\" the man said. His words were a million miles away. \"Get behind me.\"\n\nI couldn't speak. The tentacles writhed on the pavement. A black vapor surrounded the creature, and faded as the twitching slowed.\n\nI noticed his uniform. Faded blue with black accents that stretched across his chest and legs. He reached for a button on his collar. \"Confirmed contact in Auburn. Seattle containment has been breached.\"\n\nStatic, followed by a grainy response.\n\n\"Roger that, expanding zone. Continue scanning for &lt;inaudible&gt; material and engage as appropriate. Dispatching a unit &lt;inaudible&gt; and rendezvous at 0900.\"\n\nHis attention turned back to me. \"We're moving. You have any family in the area?\"\n\nFamily.\n\nFamily.\n\nMy senses snapped back.\n\n\"Oh God, I need to call my wife.\" I pulled my phone from my back pocket. As I fumbled to enter my passcode, the man slapped it out of my hand. Three more shots rung out.\n\nI guess you get desensitized pretty quickly, because my reaction was very different this time.\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing?!\" I yelled and took two steps back.\n\nThe man stared down. My phone was destroyed. The battery began sparking and a flame erupted.\n\nHe waited, then side eyed me. \"Huh, guess that was your phone. You can use mine.\"\n\nAn explosion rocked the city as we made our way back to the street. I fumbled with the phone and my memory as I tried to recall her number.\n\nThe man's collar spoke again. \"Hold position, your ride is inbound.\"\n\nA large APC turned the corner, screeching to a halt in front of us. The rear doors flung open and a man and woman armed with rifles jumped out to cover us as we got in. I caught a brief glimpse of the lettering stenciled on the right door.\n\n-NSTAR\n\nThe man talked to the others. \"Only his wallet. All other scans were clear. I also... checked his phone. Any other reports?\"\n\nThe woman spoke, \"We just got word. They're all over. Bravo engaged three phantoms a neighborhood over.\"\n\nThey continued to speak. Words I had never heard before. It all sounded insane. And it distracted me from the fact that my wife's phone wasn't ringing.\n\n\"I need to get home, and you need to tell me what's happening,\" I said. It came out far more forcefully than I had intended.\n\nThe man from the alley looked over to me. \"Welcome to the Typhon Containment Team. Let's go get your wife.\"",

But you ain't far off.\"\n\nThe man whom I'd at first thought was a mugger put away his pistol, strode over to the scrap of... of...flesh?...parts?...and stomped a few times for good measure. The squishing and squelching sounds were a little gratuitous. He produced a silver flask, and poured a measure of fluid onto the mess. It foamed like peroxide for a moment, then began smoking. Vivid green. It stank like burning plastic and mildew.\n\n\"So what was it?\" I asked.\n\nHe didn't look up from the shrinking puddle of goo. After a moment, he bent and retrieved three plastic cards, and a little bar coded key fob. I recognized them as mine, and he handed them over. They had bullet holes in them.\n\n\"Looks like it didn't finish digesting everything.\" he remarked.\n\n\"Ok,\" I persisted, \"but what was it?\"\n\nHe pulled out a pair of dark sunglasses, and produced a little silver cylinder with a red light at one end. I noticed that his dark clothing was a suit.\n\n\"No! No no no no no!\" I said, \"you are NOT going to flashy thing me!\"\n\nHe chuckled and set the cylinder on the ground between us. \"Relax. This ain't that. Just shut your eyes and hold your breath. You might need to be decontaminated.\"\n\nI bit down on a reply and complied. The thought of \"decontamination\" gave me the willies. After a moment, the scent of lilac and lawn mower clippings filled the air, and pink and golden light played across my eyelids.\n\nWhen the light dimmed, he said \"You can open your eyes.\"\n\nWith some relief, I did. I saw that he was looking at me strangely. \"What?\"\n\n\"You, uh. You didn't have even a speck of contamination. That's rare.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Look. I can't tell you everything, but this is an unusual situation. Basically, someone bad exposed you to an infectious agent, but it didn't take hold in you. You're resistant.\"\n\n\"So if I'm resistant, why the drama with my wallet?\"\n\n\"Seems like you can't be infected, but stuff you carry around a lot can. We can detect it if we can get close enough.\"\n\n\"Oh\" I said, thinking of my phone, \"uh...\"\n\n\"The wallet was the only thing infected. If it had progressed far enough, it could have bitten you-\"\n\n\"*Bitten* me?\"\n\n\"Yeah, bitten. And exposed you to enough of the pathogen to overcome your resistance. Then you'd belong to it.\"\n\n\"Belong. To it.\"\n\nHe grunted, and eyed me speculatively. \"This has got to seem weird to you.\"\n\n\"Shockingly, yes.\"\n\n\"You're taking it way better than I did my first time.\"\n\n\"I have to admit I'm half wondering when I'm going to wake up.\"\n\nHe seemed to come to a decision. \"I want you to meet someone. They can tell you more about this whole mess.\"\n\n\"Holy hell, you ARE an MIB. Are you trying to recruit me?\"\n\nHe looked at me steadily. \"Yes.\"\n\nI held up a hand placatingly. \"Look, man, I still need some time to process all of this. Can you give me a card or something, and some time to think about it?\"\n\n\"Your choice, but we gotta do this now or not at all.\"\n\nI sighed. \"Can we have this meeting somewhere other than a dark alley?\"\n\nHe smiled \"Yeah. Come on.\"\n\nI feigned a tentative smile back, drawing back the lips of my newest drone. It seemed the modified spores were working as I'd hoped, and now I finally had an agent poised to be placed among the fools who'd been foiling my takeover of the Earth.\n\nThings were looking up.\n",

The man standing before me, straight out of a video game with his smug grin, chiseled features and fancy costume, spun his gun around his index finger before swiftly and easily placing it back into its holster. My mouth fixed agape, still staring at the pathetic... wallet creature? \n\n\"Wha- what, what was that\" I barely spit out.\n\n\"You wouldn't believe me if I told you\" he said, casually walking into the dark from whence he came.The poor creature smoldering from the inside out begins turning to ash. All fear quickly fleeing my mind. As the flood of questions pour in I begin to follow him toward the open street ahead.\n\n\"Seriously, what in the fuck just happened? What about my credit cards? My ID! My-\". The man stops abruptly to my surprise and it seemed to his as well. \"Ya, know...\" He pauses and turns around slowly. \"I think I can help you. That there little friend you've had nestled to your right ass cheek is not your wallet. That's what me and my friends call a Scrimp. It was biologically engineered by team of scientists from China.\" He leans in closer and his voice gets softer, as if to not let anyone overhear. \"Now, a Scrimp can be used for a lot of purposes and take the form of, well almost anything, but only once. That one just so happened to take the form of your wallet. Now I have no idea why, how or where it did this but, if you want to find your actual wallet, we are going to need to do some back tracking and of course, I'll help\" he says as he puffs up his chest and exposes a shit eating grin.\n\n\"So kid. Where is the last place you had your wallet out of your pocket?\"\n\nTrying to make sense of exactly what the hell is going on it took me a second to think. Where did I last use my wallet. Starbucks? That was early this morning. The bodega down the block from my house? No I havent been there in days.\n\n\"Oh shit\" I said aloud, breaking  what seemed to be a dead silence. \"I remember... I used it at Cheetahs.\"\n\n\"What the hell is Cheetahs?\" the stranger asks.\n\n\"It's a club. Well kind of like a club. Like a gentlemens club.\" I say softly.\n\nAfter a short pause and moment of realization, \"A STRIP CLUB\" he bolsters with excitement. \"Woooooo weeee doggy. Here I was thinking you were some introverted nerd\" he says as he looks me up and down, \"and you're a real man after all!\" He wraps his arm over the top of my shoulders and begins walking, pulling me along. \"What does a guy like you go to a titty bar for? Lap dances right? Oh no, I know, this is one of those real seedy joints right? Blow jobs!\" he says, gaining excitement with every assumption.\n\n\"Well kid. What is it?\" He says after a short laugh.\n\n\"Definitely the blow jobs.\"\n\nI didnt know how to end this but thanks for reading it. I'm going to bed.\n",

            "comment": "Jake was getting back home late again from an exhausting day at the office. He did not like going through the alleyways as it brought back memories of his past, days he was not so proud of and could live leaving them behind. Still he was very tired and decided to cut through the alleys instead of making a cyrcle by going thtough the main roads.\n\nJake was never afraid of the alleys, he was literally raised in them. His family was poor and was leaving in a small dirtx appartement even roaches stayed clear of it. His parents liked to remind him a lot that he was a mistake, the reason for all their poverty and suffering and beat him up constantly for that mistake. Jake was never afraid of the alleys, he had seen it all in there. Crackheads, thieves, drunks, homeless people, rats the size of a dog bullying the alley cats around. Junkies attacking passengers for pocket money and once he even witnessed a rape back when he was 10. He had seen it all. Or so he thought.\n\n\"Give me your wallet! NOW!\" The voice cracked through the silence of the dark alley. Jake slowly turned to face the man. He was a tall guy, wearing a black long coat, surprisingly hot for the heat of July, and a fedora hat. Jake was stunned for a second not sure what he was witnessing. \n\n\"IF YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE, GIVE ME YOUR WALLET! NOW!\" Jake considered his options. It would not be his first alley brawl, even against an armed man. But the man was looking strange enough and he did not carry much cash anyway. With a sigh, Jake gave the man his wallet.\n\nThe man proceeds taking the wallet, never brraking eye contact from Jake, throwing it to the ground and shooting it. Hearing a screech, he turns to Jake and says \"You are safe now, you ate welcome.\" Tge man procceeds to disappear as fast and unexpectedly as he appeared. \n\nJake completely forgot he still had that small \"screaming\" alarm device a colleague of his gave him as a present. It was stupid enough and considered throwing it away, but totally forgot about it due to its small size. \"Who even thought of making such a small, stupid alarm that screams\", Jake had thought to himself with an afterthought \".. And who the hell considers it a nice gift for someone's birthday\". Still Jake could not understand what tge man meant by shooting his wallet and saying \"You are welcome\".\n\nJake entered his home, having enough of the day. His roomate, Max, was sitting in the couch, watching TV really loud for that late hour. \"Hey J-Dawg, what is up my man?\" screamed Max. \"I told you to keep down with that thing, it is midnight for Christ's sake\".\n\nMax acted as he never listened to Jake. \"Man come check it out, they finally caught that nutjob that was loose here for a week.\" \n\n\"What nutjob??\" Asked Jake perplexed. \"You know the guy that went around town shooting wallets screaming nonsense. He asked passengers for their wallets, and then he shot at them! The wallets, not the passengers.\" Max answered bacj almost laughing. \"Dude even stormed into a store and shot through their wallet collection\". \n\nJake looked at the screen, as the police arrested the lunatic that he met earlier, screaming nonsense about \"mimics\", whatever the hell that meant. The anchorman then said: \"Christopher B. Codsworth was a patient in St. Mairy's Hospital suffering from extreme paranoia. He was never dangerous to others but hospital staff was concerned about his dissapearance, almost a week ago.\" \n\nJake was stunned. He had enough fot one night. He tutned to face Max. \"You will never believe what happe-..\" Jake froze as he turned, unable to concieve what he was seeing. Max was tin on half, by two series of teeth, coming out of the couch...?\n\n\"AT LAST, CODSWORTH IS OUT OF THE PICTURE\" the couch said. \"THANK GOD I LEARNED TO TURN INTO COUCHES, HE FIGURED MY WALLET DISQUISE\". The legs of the couch began to take the form of legs and arms with sharp claws, and as the rest of the coich was transforming to a strange creature, unlike Jake ever seen before, it screamed at him: \"SORRY, NO WITNESSES.\" And with a fast strike, Jake's head fell on the floor..",

            "comment": "\"Wait... My wallet was a mimic?\"  \n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That's... weird.  I certainly have only one wallet.  Every morning, I look for it, forget that I found it, and look for it again before I wake up fully.\"  \n\n\"So a mimic replaced it.\"  \n\n\"You don't understand.  A mimic *can't* replace it.\"  The stranger just glared at me with impatience.  It was the kind of look a gas station attendant gives you when you explain for the tenth consecutive day why you need an energy drink every morning.\n\n\"Okay.  Look.  Suppose a mimic replaces my wallet.  Then my *actual* wallet would still be somewhere, right?  I would find it in the morning.\"\n\n\"What if the mimic replaced it somewhere else?\"  \n\n\"Then it would still need even more mimics to replace all the stuff *in* my wallet.  Think about it.\"  \n\n\"So it gets more mimics.\"\n\n\"But mimics can't replicate circuits.  Even if somehow the magnetic strips on my cards and license still worked, the chip in my credit card wouldn't.\"  \n\nHe took a deep breath, wiped the sweat off his face with both hands, and kept pressing me to accept the mimic nature of my wallet.  \"So it replaces them, and then attacks before you use them.\"\n\n\"I *just used* my chip card to buy that soda you made me drop.\"  \n\n\"Your wallet is a mimic, okay?  Look!  I shot it, and it screamed.  Do wallets that aren't mimics scream?\"  \n\nHe had a point.  \"Okay, my wallet is a mimic.  But that just raises more questions.\"\n\n\"Like...?\"  \n\n\"We just established that it must have replaced my wallet *before* I put all my cards in it.\"\n\n\"And?\"  \n\n\"That was three years ago, when I bought it.  I kept my old wallet until it started to tear, and grabbed the new one on impulse.  All my stuff was swapped over right there.\"  \n\n\"So you've been carrying a mimic for three years.\"  \n\n\"Exactly.  Mimics attack as soon as you get close.  How have I carried a mimic for three years?  Why would a mimic just stay that way without feeding all that time?\"  \n\nIt wasn't dead.  The poor thing just kept quiet, wounded, this whole time.  Until it...  Well, it spoke!  \"I like... butts.\"  \n\nAstounding!  In all the years of research now, since they were discovered, nobody has ever found that a mimic could speak.  Nobody ever *tried*, but it was just assumed they couldn't.  The stranger was flabbergasted, but I needed to know more.  This puzzle had to be solved.\n\n\"Wait though.  That still doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\"H-how does it not make sense?  It just said it likes butts.\"  \n\n\"Look at my butt!\"  I turned around, and bent over, so the stranger would keep up with my explanation.  \"Does this look like the kind of butt you'd live on for three years; *especially* if you like butts?  It's hardly even there!  I literally work this thing off every day!\"\n\n\"Don't be silly.  You *have* a butt.  The mimic likes butts.  There you go.\"\n\n\"Really?  Grab it.\"  He holstered his double barrel revolver somewhere in his leather duster, and rolled his eyes.  He was visibly uncomfortable, but this had gone so far already that no professional mimic hunter could drop it then and there.  He grabbed my butt.  \n\n\"You see?!  All bone.  There's just enough butt that I can move.  Extreme efficiency; no extra butt to speak of.  If butts are mimic homes, this is a small studio apartment.  If butts are mimic bedding, this is a concrete slab.\"  \n\n\"Okay!  Okay!\"  He released my butt, and I stood up.  \"So the mimic has a particular taste in butts.  Maybe you have a niche butt!  I'm not a butt connoisseur.  I can't say what butt mimics like!\"    \n\nThe mimic piped up again.  \"It's not *your* butt.\"  \n\n\"See?  It likes butts, but not specifically my butt.  So...  Three years?\"  Wait a minute...  \"You spent *three years* on a butt you don't like?!  Wait.  You don't like my butt?!\"\n\n\"You just proved you have no butt, so why are you upset about it now?\"  \n\nThe mimic hunter had a point, but that wasn't the point.  \"So, I don't like my butt!  That doesn't mean it's okay for someone else to just put it out there that *they* don't like my butt!  That's bad manners!\"  \n\n\"Bad manners.  A mimic...\"  He took another deep, cleansing breath.  \"Nevermind that.  You literally just bent over to convince me that I shouldn't like your butt.\"  \n\n\"So what!  That was to prove a point!  This is different!\"  I was yelling then, \"Mimic, explain yourself right now!  Why'd you spend three years on a bad butt?!  Do you like my butt or not?\"  \n\n\"I like your butt,\" it explained, \"because I love you.\"  And just then, my wallet died.  That's why I'm using a chip card from my pocket to pay for ice cream.  Now, let me pay so I can go home, bury my wallet, and cry.  I'll be here tomorrow morning for an energy drink because I work my butt off every day.\n\n\"I asked if you need a bag.\"\n\n",

It makes you want to see pain and suffering whenever money is destroyed.  I've killed a great deal of money in my time, and the anger is unbearable.  For the sake of the world, I keep going.\" he says.\n\n\"How do you deal with this feeling?\" You ask honestly.\n\n\"I take it out on my son.  It's a sacrifice for sure.  But he's a good obedient kid who's never touched money. So when I slap him on one side of the face, he turns me his other cheek and patiently waits for me to slap that one as well.  He knows I have to get out my anger to continue my quest to save the world.  For I so love the world that I am giving my only begotten son to this cause.  And whosoever shall believe me and give me their wallet will not perish but shall be free.\" he explains.\n\n\"This sounds familiar.\" you say.\n\n\"If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have the treasure of freedom. Then come, follow me.\" he says.\n\n\"Sell all my possessions?  I thought the goal was to get rid of money!  And if I give to the poor then are I not just passing the buck literally?\" you ask.\n\n\"The poor spend their money quickly, long before the parasite can form a psychic hold on the host.  The rich hold on to their money and make the rich even richer.  Forgive them, those rich people, for they know not what they do.\"\n\n\"What must I do then?\" You ask.\n\n\"Follow me, for just as you love to catch pokemon in pokemon go, I will make you a catcher of men.\"\n\nYou feel a twinge of regret at the idea of never becoming rich yourself.  \"So I will never know wealth?\"\n\n\"Truly I tell you.  It is hard for someone who is rich to free themselves of these parasites.  It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a sewing needle than for a rich man to free himself.\" he explains.\n\nYou think about this.  \"Well, if I was rich I could afford to have a really really big sewing needle made and buy some camels...\"\n\n\"No!  That's not the point.\" your mugger argues.  \"Do you accept my gift or don't you?\"\n\n\"The gift of not being shot in the chest?\" you clarify.\n\n\"Yes. No man can serve two masters: for either he. will hate the one, and love the other; or else. he will hold to the one, and despise the other.  You can not both serve our cause and love money.  I'd rather shoot you than see you enslaved to wealth.\"  he says.\n\nYou and your mugger finally set out on your quest.  Along the way you mug more people and convince each of them to free themselves of money.  For decades, progress is slow.  You are persecuted by rich people who's parasites cause them to see you as a threat.  Yet steadily, you make progress.\n\nIn time you have a large movement behind you. You gather large groups of people together once a week who drop all their money into a collection basket that is passed around so that the money can be safely burned.  Eventually your movement grows so large that the only people left are the very rich and those who have no money at all. \n\nYou have convinced 99% of the world to avoid money at all costs.  People do not own property any more of any kind.  Even owning a comb is considered blasphemy if you still have ten fingers in which to run through your hair.  There comes a time when the collection plates run empty, for the poor have no more money to burn.  The poor refuse to take money from the rich, which makes money worthless towards buying goods or services.  Then finally, the rich are free.  For once no one will take their money any more, they are also poor.  Together, with the mugger who threatened your life, you have saved the world.\n",

            "comment": "The weirdest day. Where to start? First, my job went missing. What I mean to say is that, the entire building where I work was just...\n\nMissing.\n\n. \n\nAnd before that, my car wouldn't start. Which meant I was going to be fired (after months of depression and missing work, they made me sign a zero tolerance policy for being late). So I was almost relieved when the taxi driver was driving like a maniac. I swear... We were going to hit that bus straight on...\n\n. \n\nAnd now, knowing what I know about things like Quantum Taxis and peanut butter not actually existing, that whole day makes sense. Alan, Selma, Qth'blorthrox, and Jim... They'd been preparing for this day for years. Maybe my whole life. Or... All of my lives, as it were.\n\n. \n\nNow, that first day seems as boring as a 1pm math class in eleventh grade, when you know you *might* go to community college.\n\n. \n\nWhere was I? Oh. Yes. So, there I was, hotdog in hand, wondering how to explain to the plump, and increasingly annoyed Filipino lady at the unemployment office that, \"No. My company did not go out out of business. It went missing\", when I heard a cry for help.\n\n. \n\nI acknowledge that you don't know much about me. And as it turns out, God, most of the Universe, and especially the citizens of the 'United Totalitarian Societies of Anti-Life and All That Stuff' also don't know enough about me, but at that time I was not the type of person to answer a cry for help originating from a darkened alley.\n\n. \n\nEspecially with a half eaten hot dog topped with ketchup, mustard, and sourkraut (I never get sourkraut, but it had been a weird day, and I decided to try something new for the first time in... ages).\n\n. \n\nBut, whether by for-ordained design, or because a rather menacing fellow in a trench coat was lumbering towards me, I decided to quickly hustle down a darkened alley that I normally would not have entered, wielding only a hotdog and recurring depression as my weapons of defense.\n\n. \n\nAnyway. Sorry. I get distracted. I was always a poor storyteller, but it has gotten terribly worse since I stopped existing. Which is getting ahead of myself. \n\nOk.\n\nAlleyway. Gun. Wallet. Yeah.\n\n. \n\nSo there I was, unknowingly stepping into a dimension that can best be described as kind of \"Shitty Greyhound bus stop in the middle of nowhere, but you are still worried about that stray dog across the street with an obviously fake limp, so as to gain your sympathy\", when I saw a man crouching in the middle of the alleyway, in-between your standard London trash bin (which was strange because I lived in Chicago), and a rather menacing cascade of old cardboard boxes leaning against a nearby wall (whom I would come to know as Selma, the love of my life).\n\n. \n\n... Um...? Oh. Right. Trench coat. Drawn gun. Darkened alley. So there I was, with just a hotdog dangerously cooling toward that temperature where the tepid greasy taste really becomes noticeable, and my \"infinite ability to save the universe, and everything else that has been and ever will be\", when the man in trench coat stood up and asked for my wallet.\n\n. \n\nAnd to be honest, I had very good reasons for not giving it to him. Not that the man in question had any nefarious look to him, nor any apparent weakness that gave me courage. His face was unremarkable. His trench coat somehow gave the impression that he could be really fat, but you almost second guess yourself and think you saw a couple layers of clothes that are probably making him look quite a bit more fat and you shouldn't think of portly people in such of a negative tone of voice, even if it is in your own head. \n\n. \n\nHe was neither tall, nor especially short. And even now, after knowing him for easily 10 trillion years, I couldn't pick him out of a lineup at a police station (not that lineups, police stations, or 'everything that ever was or ever will be' exists anymore).\n\n. \n\nI didn't know it at the time, but I was really resistant to giving my wallet to the best friend I have ever had in all of the lives I have ever lived (which is really saying something!). And I had a perfectly good reason why I did not want to give him my wallet.\n\n. \n\nIt was that all-powerful combination of a \"cherished object from childhood that you're also embarrassed to admit or show to people now that you're an adult\".\n\n. \n\nThe same quantum-emotional psychic energy that powers the war-machines of galaxy-spanning empires, as well as really fueling those awkward moments at a party you decided to host in your (a little too small for a party that you didn't think anyone would really show up) apartment and now you regret letting people into your bedroom because it was too crowded in the combined living room/kitchen/laundry room.\n\n. \n\nMy wallet from 5th grade, actually. A faded and patched up denim wallet, with one third of an autobot logo decal clinging to it like a person on the verge of suicide. The kind of person looking at a 'Hang In There' kitten poster and trying to think that as clich\u00e9 as it is, this poster was put there by God, for them, right then and there. \n\nWhich it was.\n\nYou're *WELCOME*.\n\n.\n\nThe kind of wallet that you found the courage to go to the house of the bully who took it from you after school and ask his dad, (who really should be at work and not drunk at 2:30 pm), for your wallet back.\n\n.\n\nThe kind of wallet where that cool skater girl who was heartbreakingly intelligent, but also so deeply codependent from her dad's inability to show affection that she would date awful \"cool guy\" jerks like Taylor Rathmussen until her mid-forties. \nThe kind of fun, authentic person who could turn your social anxiety on a dime, because she thought it was hilarious and awesome that you still owned a denim wallet in 11th grade.\n\n.\n\nSo, you can imagine my resistance to giving up such a treasured and embarrassing item to an unassuming man, while we both stood in another dimension that was doing a poor impersonation of a dimly lit alleyway. \n\n.\n\nPlus... I was holding a half-eaten hotdog that was at the aforementioned critical tipping point between \"delicious\" and \"fucking gross, what are you, some kind of pig? God... I am a total pig\".\nWhich is widely accepted as the only two states that hotdogs can exist in. \n\n.\n\nBut as he stood up, I noticed that he had a light pink pastel chalk in his hand, and I retroactively noticed that he had just completed a drawing of a gun on one brick from the cobbled (British, not Chicago) back alley street. \n\n.\n\nA perfectly good drawing of a six shooter pistol you would draw as a kid. Complete with all of the wobbly lines along the length of the barrel, and an oversized pistol grip that you would come to expect with a young child's drawing.\n\n.\n\nAnd upon spotting the drawing, I was filled with such dread that I immediately shoved the hotdog in my mouth (I am not one to waste money, even on a hotdog that had become gross and God I am such a pig) and handed my treasured, yet embarrassing wallet to the nondescript man in the trench coat.\n\n.\n\nAnd so filled with dread I was, (dare I say even more dread than when the end of \"the Universe and everything that was and every will be\" , was about to happen), that my brain felt much more relief than incredulity when he nonchalantly turned, cocked my wallet like the two dimensional drawing he was about to fire upon, and fired upon the drawing of the two dimensional pistol with my wallet until the entire drawing was eradicated from the face of the brick.\n\n.\n\nLooking back, it seemed like such a weird day. But I was a different person (thing, entity, God of gods, recently-unemployed depressed man) back then. Just about the only normal thing that day was the moment right after the nondescript man in a trench coat finished killing a two dimensional drawing of a pistol with my treasured yet embarrassing childhood wallet in a inter-dimensional bus stop posing as a darkened British cobblestone alley in a minor Chicago side street.\n\n.\n\nThe moment when he handed my wallet back, put an uncomfortably presumptuous hand on my shoulder, and smiled when he said,\n\n.\n\n\"Hi. My name is Jim. And I just want you to know that we've been the best of friends for a long time\".\n\n.\n\nWhich was weird of him to say, if you ever get to know the man.\n\n==============================\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:\nYes, I passive-aggressively took the ambiguous grammar in the writing prompt title and made a whole story because the questionable grammar inspired me to write something fun.\n\n.\n\nYes, I am a fan of Douglas Adams (especially his two books on \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\"), as well as the book \"Good Omens\", co-authored by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaimen.\n\n.\n\nAlso. Probably typos. I am on a phone. In my bed. Depressed and unemployed.",

            "comment": "\"You shot my wally!\" I screamed at the man nearly twice my height. \n\n\"You gave your wallet a name? What are you ten?\" The smoke cleared from the strange gun the man had in his hands as the wallet he had shot began to ooze black blood. The man's face was masked beneath the shadows flickering on the overhead light in the alley. It was beginning to dim. The electricity in the bulb pulsing inside it was dying. \n\n\"Actually, yes. I am ten.\" \n\nIt was half true.\n\nThe man clicked his tongue and then pulled a piece of paper from his pocket and began reading off it. \n\n\"Have no fear citizen. You may have encountered a slyph. Please step back and wait for the proper authorities to arrive... Wait, this is the wrong script,\" the man stuffed the paper back into his pocket and scrambled around, \"I am the 'proper authority',\" he said it to himself, as though I wasn't even there.\n\n\"First day?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Maybe... pretty sassy for a ten year old with chin acne.\" He pulled out another slip of paper.\n\n\"You've may have encountered a slyph. Stay calm and do your best to assist the shadow officer in his duties. That's me,\" The man said pointing to himself. He then continued reading, \"have you noticed anything strange? Any electrical spikes, children with chin acne...\" The man's voice trailed off and his eyes began to lift from the paper he was reading off of to stare at me. \n\nHe nervously glared at me and read the last words, \"or wallets that bleed when bludgeoned, cut, torn, or are shot.\" \n\nI gave a howling laugh that resonated off the old brick walls of the alley. \n\n\"The bureau really needs to stop sending newbies.\" \n\nHe didn't scream when I ate him, it was too quick. I swallowed him whole. Then I picked up my now dead wally that I used to bait humans and walked off.\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "\"You're safe now\"\n\nI shot him point-blank, scattering his brains into the darkness of the alley behind him. I stared coldly at the look of shock on his corpse and it collapsed first to it's knees and then toppled lifelessly onto its side, revealing the cavern that had been blown open on the back of the head.\n\nHurriedly I pocketed the firearm and kneeled next to the screeching form on the ground, the disguise of a wallet slipping off it as it continued to writhe in pain. I coo'd softly and gently scooped it up. The facade of leather faded quickly, the flaps at either side revealing themselves as bat like wings, the middle shifting into a hideous face that cried and cried.\n\n\"It's okay\" I murmured, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know he was one of those holier-than-thou jackasses from the academy. It won't happen again, don't worry, we'll get you all fixed up, Ms Jacky'll get you sorted. We'll get you all healed up and then we'll get you back to home where the academy will never bother you again.\" \n\nThe cries slipped to uncertain hiccups and then to silence as I spoke, a pair of shiny black eyes, wet from tears, gazed at me as I spoke. I lifted it slowly and pointed to a star, bringing the sad creature directly under my eye so it could follow my finger. \"Right up there, we'll send you back and your family will be waiting for you and they'll be so happy to see you.\" I kissed it on the forehead, \"And you'll go back to a normal life.\"\n\nIt looked at me for a moment longer before chirping happily. It flapped it's wings once, twice, and was suddenly a wallet again. I held it loosely in one hand and rested that hand on my shoulder, talking now as I walked. \"Why, I bet we've already gotten another message from them, they've been transmitting nonstop about how happy they are to hear you're alright.\" I said, continuing on and on as me and my wallet made our way into the silent night, even as the faint hum of police sirens began to whine behind us.\n\n ",

The house was quiet and dark except for the low glow of the tv static. We hadn't been able to pay the bills for that.  It was December and in a choice between gas and tv we had made the smart call. \n\nIt had been easier when mom was helping.  She helped with the bills. She made me laugh when things were gloomy. We were a team. We'd been a team for a long time and we kept each other alive. The depression had finally been stronger than our team. The tug of war was over. She was gone. Her pills laid scattered across the the room above me finalizing her form on the floor. \n\nI had to call the police. Or the Ambulance. Or someone...\n\nBut instead, here I sit with beer in hand and wishing I had taken off today to stay with her. That I could have saved her the way she has been saving me since the eighth grade. That I could have been her rock. Like my dad was.  Like he had been before things got to hard and he left in search of the iconic pack of smokes that is the holy grail for all deadbeat fathers.  \n\nLike my father I left her today.  To go to work.  But she asked me to stay and I didn't. I told myself she'd be fine.  I rationalized.  You can't rationalize depression. \n\nI reached over to the coffee table and felt the cold metal of the gun that sits in front of me. I caressed it. I made a decision. 'I can't leave her alone again.'  \n\nI heard the rattle and clang of keys in the door and I jumped. I slipped the gun into my pocket and stared at the door. I felt wild. I felt fierce as the door knob turns and the door slips open.  \n\n\"... i'm home! It was pretty busy and I saw this strange light...who the hell are you?\" the stranger broke off as he caught a glimpse of me. \n\nI stared at him.  I felt something in my head pounding and then there was a shift. I searched wildly through long forgotten thoughts and remembered a face I had tried to wash away. \n\n\"Dad?\" I said tentatively.\n\n\"Who the fu...? Josh? Is that you? How...what...?\" he stared at me in confusion.  The flickering snow of tv static was playing tricks with features. \n\n\"You've been gone. For a long time.\"\n\n\"I just left an hour ago,  what do you mean a long time? Where is your mom?\" \n\nI kept staring at him. I felt tension in my neck and arms.  I felt rage that he could walk back in here like nothing had happened. I felt sadness.  I felt everything for the first time in an hour.  Since the discovery. Since the beginning of the end. \n\n\"She is upstairs.  She's been waiting.\"\n\nHis eyes have finally taken in everything. The newer tv, the different decor.  My older face and the tired jumpsuit that hangs off me. I can see his brain working overtime to process this revelation.  He looks down at the pack of smokes in his hands. He mumbles something about the light. \n\n\"Son? I... don't know...?\"\n\nI stopped him,  \"It's okay.  Let's go see mom. She'll understand.  Everything can change in an hour.\"\nI lead him towards the stairs,  the cold metal in my pocket rests against my  other hand. \"We're going to be a family again.\"\n",

            "comment": "It was a cold, bright Feburary morning, snow gently falling across the frozen ground as I sat in my backyard, drinking hot chocolate and enjoying a day's respite from high school. I stared blankly at my phone, my mind lost in thought as the video on its screen past by unnoticed. More important things were going through my mind, at least more important to a teenage boy, thoughts of pretty girls, nice cars, next year's football season, and so on. \n\nI was so lost in my own mind that I failed to notice the ruckus eminating from inside the house. It startled me to hear my step-father suddenly start yelling. Another man chimed in, yelling back, and I heard sounds of a scuffle. I quickly put my phone down and ran inside the house, nearly running over my mother as she made her way in the same direction. Together, we rushed in to the foyer.\n\nThe scene left both my mother and I stricken, mouths agape, jaws dropped. My father, missing for 10 years, lay on the ground holding his head, a bright bruise starting to appear under his right eye. My stepfather stood above him, shouting at him to get out of our house. He had never met my father, had came into the picture some years after my father's mysterious disappearance to comfort my mother and eventually start a new family with her, so he had no idea who this man was or why he had intruded into our home. In his hand, my stepfather had his cell phone out, most likely dialing the police, to come arrest this stranger. My mother, partially regaining her senses, reached out and touched his arm. \n\n\tMom: \"Dave... this man... this is.. Kevin.\"\n\n\tStep-father: \"Kevin... your first husband?\"\n\nDave, my step-father, looked down at the man, his phone forgotten. \n\n\tDave: \"You said he was dead...\"\n\n\tMom: \"He was missing, presumed dead. He was declared dead after a few years when they found no trace of him.\"\n\t\nMom directed her attention to Kevin.\n\n\tMom: \"Kevin... where have you been? It's been 10 years! You've been alive this whole time?!\"\n\t\nKevin looked up, startled. He had a hand to his eye, massaging what must have been where an unexpected right hook landed cleanly.\n\n\tKevin: \"What the hell are you talking about?! I left half an hour ago! I'm sorry it took so long, I got stuck in traffic! Jesus, is that all the time it took for you to roll some other man in here?!\"\n\t\nHe looked around the room, noticing for the first time that the furniture and decor around the foyer was different than he remembered. His eyes panned over to me, and I watched as panic, confusion, and sadness immediately flashed across his face.\n\n\tKevin: \"Son... oh my god, son. You're so much older now... you're a man now. What has happened to me...\"\n\t\nHe broke down, tears falling from his eyes. \n\nI moved over to him, putting my arms around him, tears falling from my eyes as well. I had not seen this man for 10 years, had pushed him out of my mind and replaced him with Dave, had given up hope on ever seeing him again, yet in that moment, emotions took over, and I felt guilt at my actions. This man loved me, loves me, and it was wrong of me to have given up hope. My father embraced me, sobbing into my shirt, as my other parents looked on.\n\n\tDave: \"I don't believe it. The one damn time I need to make an emergency call and this fucking phone that I'm paying $200 a month for doesn't fucking work. What the fuck do you mean 'No Signal'?\"\n\t\n\tMom: \"You're still calling the police?!\"\n\t\n\tDave: \"This man has been missing for 10 years. He doesn't realize how much time has passed. He doesn't need to be arrested, but he definitely needs an ambulance!\"\n\t\nMom thought about this a moment, then agreed. She started patting her pockets, trying to find her phone. Exasperated, she looked back to me and my father.\n\n\tMom: \"Son, do you have your phone? I don't remember where I left mine.\"\n\t\nI looked back to her, tears still falling from my eyes, and began patting my own pockets. After a moment, I realized that I had left it out back on the patio with my mug.\n\n\tMe: \"It's out back, I'll go grab it.\"\n\t\nI looked back at my father, squeezed him once more, and trotted out of the foyer towards the back door. I exited the house, walked to the patio, and grabbed my phone. The words 'No Signal' were at the top of the screen. I looked quizically at it... I had never seen it say that before, we're in the middle of the suburbs in a major city, there are cell towers everywhere. \n\nI half-sat at the patio chair, more of a lean than anything, and pulled up the phone dialer anyways to try to make a call. I stared blankly at the phone, my mind lost in thought as the screen flashed \"No signal\" again. Suddenly, thoughts of pretty girls, nice cars, and next year's football season enveloped my mind. My step-father's yell snapped my attention back to reality, as I heard a scuffle eminating from the foyer. I quickly put my phone down and ran inside the house, nearly running over my mother as she made her way in the same direction. \n\nTogether, we rushed in to the foyer, and the same scene replayed itself again. And again. And again. And again.",

            "comment": "You stared at him dumbfounded as he hung up his jacket in the hallway. He passed you on the way to the sitting room and turned on the TV. You turned to follow him and the news caught your attention, it showed a meteor strike that supposedly happened about an hour ago.\n\n\"Bob tell me, why did it only affect this specific town in California?\"\n\n\"I don't know Alice, but it seems that we're receiving more and more phone calls from civilians about their children gone missing.\"\n\n\"Is there a link? Are these phone calls received at the same time?\"\n\n\"I don't know but I have the feeling that the meteor has something to do with this case.\n\nNow on to Amanda for today's weather.\"\n\nDad switched off the TV and turned to face me.\n\n\"I haven't left for 10 years, I've seen you grow up. Been to the principals office countless times for you being in trouble and buried your mother...\" He bit his lip and quickly regained his posture.\n\nDad walked to the coffee table and took his diary from the drawer underneath. He flipped through it and I noticed there was a different date on each page, no date was missing. It was as if he documented every day of his life. He stopped at the last page, which had today's date written on top. He looked me dead in the eye and smiled.\n\n\"Today is the day, today you turn 18.\" He handed me the diary and ran his hands through his hair. I couldn't say anything, I just looked down at the worn down notebook that had well over 300 pages.\n\n\"Dad?\" My lips trembled, I was confused. For 10 long years he was never here, yet he said he buried my mother and watched me grow older.\n\n\"Close your eyes.\" Dad placed his hands on my shoulders. I wasn't sure what was going on as I was still confused, but I decided to obey.\n\nUpon opening my eyes, I saw my dad standing there, he seemed taller and had less wrinkles.\n\n\"Only you can stop this son, only you can stop this.\" My eyes slid down to my hands, I was still carrying the notebook. Behind me I heard an agonising scream, it was a lady out in the streets.\n\n\"My baby! Where is my baby!\" The woman kept on screaming and yelling.\n\n\"It's time.\" Dad said and walked out the house, into the backyard followed by my mother, whose face I couldn't see no matter how hard I tried.\n\n\"Mommy?\" I looked down at the diary again and opened it on the first page. It mentioned today's date, 10 years ago. It stated I had returned from the future after the first meteor and I was the chosen one to save the world from the future meteor strike. The one 10 years in the future. Had I time travelled? Without thinking, I walked out the door, watching my parents along with the whole neighbourhood stare into the sky. A large bright light seemed to head our way, it became brighter and brighter and in a split second, half our town was gone. Evaporated.\n\nWith the diary in hand, I fell to my knees. In front of the gaping hole that killed half the state. I flipped through the diary again, looking for tomorrow's date. Some letters were disappearing. I had the feeling my time was running out. That I had to warn everyone about the next meteor that would wipe half of this earth. But who would believe an 8 year old? I harshly wiped away my tears and read the next page.\n\nIt only mentioned a formula and a drawing of a machine. It was named 'The After Years: Time Machine. Model: 0.v4.'\n\nI was studying to become a scientist and had always been interested in time paradoxes and time travelling.\n\n\"I won't let you down, dad. I now have an additional 10 years to save the world.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so sorry if this sucked. My native language is Dutch and I also tend to type whatever pops up in my head. But it's my first WP post, so I hope I did well.",

            "comment": "The rattling of the keys followed by the clicking of the locks sent me jumping to my feet. Since mom had passed, I was the only one with keys to the house.\n\nI barreled toward my room's drawer, and took my pistol from underneath a bundle of folded sheets. In the entrance, the wood creaked, and the door grated shut.\n\nHeart thumping, I loaded the gun, ears strained, and skulked toward the noises, attempting to predict where the intruder was heading to.\n\nHe was coming straight to my room. I sprung behind the bed, hiding. The steps got louder, until the door swung open, and a soft, papery said, \"Ophelia, where have you gone? I've got the cigarettes.\"\n\nI frowned. He knew my mother? That voice. It sounded so familiar. I craned my neck slightly to see the intruder, gun at the ready.\n\nIt was then when my heart sank to the depths of my stomach. I gulped down all the stress and worries knotting my chest, and put the lock back into the gun before hiding it into my pocket. \"Dad?\"\n\n\"Oh hey, Ricky. What are you doing hiding over there?\" he said nonchalantly. Although ten years had gone by, only a handful of new wrinkles lined his pale-white skin. \"Have you seen' your mother? I brought her the camels she asked for. Let me tell you, she better come back soon cause they ain't cheap, and I crave a good smoke.\"\n\n\"What do you mean if I have seen mom?\" I met his eyes. \"Where had you been. It's been ten years! We thought you had been kidnapped or murdered!\"\n\nHis brows drew into a deep scowl. \"Ten years? Son, ain't you a crazy one. It ain't April Fools just yet, and you already playing jokes. Now, tell your mother I stole two cigarettes from the package. I will be downstairs, watching the football.\" He walked to the door, halted and turned to me, head tilted. \"You should let that beard grow, you lookin' like a boy with that baby skin.\" Then, smiling, he went downstairs.\n\nI sat on the edge of the bed, perplexed, ran my hands ran through my beard. It was thick and long, worthy of a lumberjack. I'd let it grow due to him. He'd always said the say thing to me before he left us ten years ago, and I thought that, perhaps, in some strange way, he'd comeback just to see if I'd grown a proper beard, and he would hug me and congratulate me, tell me I looked like the man he'd always wanted as a son.\n\nAnd now, ten years later, he'd walked in the house as if not a second had gone by, and for some odd reason he didn't see the effects time had had on me.\n\nI headed downstairs. Perhaps I could snatch something out of him.\n\n*I'm tellin' you, darling. Two dollars a package of camels? It ain't right.* I heard him said in the distance. *Damned be the day we smoke the first one. I'm tellin' you, it will take us to the grave.*\n\nWho was he talking to? Why was he in the kitchen.\n\n\"Dad, who are you speaking with?\" I asked as I walked into the kitchen. He was leaning against the refrigerator, smoking a cigarette and grinning. Although his lips shut into a line and his brows creased when he heard my question.\n\n\"I don't know what has gotten into your mind, son,\" he said and pointed to an empty chair. \"I'm talking to your mother right there. Have you been smoking the devil's lettuce?\"\n\n\"I--I--I was just playing a joke. Hello mom,\" I said and waved at the chair. Then, I dug out my phone from pocket, and went to the bathroom so I could speak without being heard. \"Be right back.\" \n\n\"911 what's your emergency?\"\n\n\"It's my dad. He's been missing for ten years. He came into my house walking as if not a second had gone by.\"\n\n\"Keep calm, sir. Is he hostile?\"\n\n\"No, he-he's acting as he always had. I'm starting to believe there's something wrong with him.\"\n\n\"Wrong in what way, sir?\"\n\n\"In his brain. He's acting crazy. My mom passed eight years ago, and he's convinced she's there with him. And I believe he sees me as if I were still a teenager.\"\n\n\"Are you safe, sir?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Has anyone in your family ever had problems with mental diseases like dementia or schizophrenia?\"\n\n\"My grandmother and grandfather had dementia.\"\n\n\"I'm sending an ambulance right now. Confirm please your address is Shelpshire 722. Follow your father's train of thought until the doctors arrive. Don't scare nor agitate him. As you said, it seems like he's suffering from something. \"\n\n\"That is my address. Thank you very much.\"\n\nI hung up, got out the bathroom and went back to the kitchen.\n\nHe was not there.\n\nDesperate, I searched the house. But the silence was absolute, and every room was empty. His keys were atop the kitchen's table, and so were his cigarettes. On my bed I found a note.\n\n*Didn't want to disturb you while you were doing your private things, son. Your mother ran out of cigarettes. I went to the store to buy some, I will be back in thirty minutes.*\n\nIn time, the doctors rang the bell. Shaking, I opened the door for the doctors to come in. \"Doctor Tart? What are you doing here? I--I--my father! He came back left a note. It's over there on the table. Come, please come.\"\n \n\"Calm down, Ricky,\" Tart said, placed a hand on my shoulder. \"It's gonna be all right.\"\n\n\"All the pills are in the flask, Tart,\" the other doctor said.\n\n\"Ricky, where is that note?\"\n\n\"Over there, on the table.\" I pointed at it, and everything inside me shattered. There was nothing there.\n\n\"It's the third time he has done this, Tart,\" the other doctor said. \"He refuses to take his medicine. His hallucinations are getting worse. I told you he was not ready to get out the ward. We must take him back.\"\n\n\"The ward?\" I said, my extremities quivering wildly. \"What ward? Why is it so cold in here?\"\n\n\"Listen, Ricky,\" Tart said, his eyes gentle, voice caring. \"I will give you one last opportunity. You have to take your pills. Will you cooperate with us this time? It's for your own good. I understand you feel like an addict, but you have to understand too that you need them. Will you take them?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. The other doctor held out a pill for me. I swallowed it. \"But he was here. I swear it. He was here. He's suffering from dementia. I swear.\"\n\nThe doctors shared a knowing look.\n\n\"What is that look. Are you going to take me by force back to the ward?\" I fought to hold back rising tears.\n\n\"Ricky,\" Tart said, took a deep breath, his lips a tight line.\n\n\"What is it, doctor?\"\n\n\"Your father died of a heart attack ten years ago. He collapsed on the streets. You were going to the store with him when it happened.\"\n    \n--------------------------\n\nr/NoahElowyn",

And then again, his dad came back 5 years later. Ricky never let his dad leave his side, or the house again so he will not wait for years again anymore.  He's now trying to solve or look for clues how it happened while dealing with his dad, who still sees them as 15 years ago.\"",

Construction equipment is to be moved and operated in order to maintain the appearance of an active construction zone. No access to SCP-711-J is permitted. In the event that a human enters SCP-711-J, they are to be presumed lost. \n\nWhen an human emerges from SCP-711-J, reintegration procedure Delta-711-J is to be initiated. \n\nDescription: SCP-711-J is the former site of a 7-11 located in [REDACTED]. Upon entry by a human, the human will disappear from outside view, to reappear between five and ten years later. All subjects are under the impression that time proceeded normally while inside SCP-711-J, giving approximate times between 5 and 15 minutes experienced in SCP-711-J. There currently seems to be no correlation between external and internal experienced time. \n\nSCP-711-J was brought to the attention of the Foundation by [REDACTED], after their father returned after being absent for over ten years, while the father reports only having left his house half an hour ago. Subsequent polygraph tests revealed both statements to be true. \n\nIn addition to the persons trapped in SCP-711-J, the vehicles that these people drove to SCP-711-J also disappear and reappear at the same time as the subject. As such, great care is to be taken to never stand in parking spaces, or near gas pumps. \n\nThe number of persons trapped inside the anomalous effect of SCP-711-J is currently unknown. As such, the structure of SCP-711-J must be maintained for the safety of all trapped humans. \n\nReintegration procedure Delta-711-J: This particular 7-11 began business in 1993. As such, all information of events over the past several years must be presented in a calm, orderly fashion to any humans exiting SCP-711-J. In addition, marital and financial issues may be present. The Foundation should provide reasonable legal support, and lodging. ",

The lines on his weather beaten face are that of a hard life. \n\n\nMom is hurrying between the kitchen and dinner table. She keeps her head down and eyes on her task as He throws little jibs at her. \n\n\nI try to catch her eye. Mom... what do we do? Do we pretend nothing's happened. Do we keep going as if everything is fine? Do we confront and make a fuss. Demand answers? Which is the right way mom? \n\n\nFinally the table is set and mom sits in her usual place to the right of my dad. Only I'm left standing there. Unsure. Confused. Waiting. \n\n\nIf he demands I sit, I'll tell him off. Confront him and even kick him out. If he does it in an apologetic way I might let it slide for now. If he's too timid though then I'll know he's here to mooch off us and won't allow it.  \n\n\nA little thought in the back of head started whispering and I pushed it back. I won't think of that. It's not going to happen. It won't!\n\n\n*What if he doesn't acknowledges you? What will you do? What can you do?* \n\n\nI wait, and wait, and wait.",

            "comment": "\u201cOh my goodness, noooo!\u201d exclaimed my mum from the kitchen. \n\nI jumped right out of bed and stumbled down the stairs worried that something had happened to my mother. She was already well into her late 50s and the doctor had told her to keep out of the kitchen as she tends to get a little clumsy sometimes. \n\n\u201cMum, whaaa-\u201c I was stopped mid-sentence as I was greeted with the sight of my mother picking up the torn remains of the photograph of our family while my stepdad, Cole, stood next to her looking down furiously upon her. \n\nThey both shifted their attention to me almost immediately. \n\n\u201cMum, what\u2019s up?\u201d I questioned.\n\n\u201cOh nothing sweetie. We were just talking.\u201d She replied me with an anxious smile plastered on her face. \n\nI never really got along with Cole but ever since Dad went missing, he was always there for my mum and they eventually got married. Cole was someone my dad met just a few months before he went missing. During that period, my mum, dad and he used to spend a lot of time together. They had become very close friends before the unfortunate incident took place. Although Cole did hang around the house a lot when dad was around, as an 8 year old I never really got along with him. He just did not feel right but after my dad left us, my mum confided in him and they decided to tie the knot. I was not opposed to it, whatever makes my mum happy, right?\n\n \u201cWhy is that photo torn?\u201d I probed further. From what I could make out from the distance, it was the photo taken a year after my dad went missing. The photo had my mum, Cole and me in it. \n\n\u201cNothing honey, you can go back to your room now.\u201d She responded. I could feel the slight frustration in her voice and that just made me even more curious.\n\n\u201cMum, what is happening?\u201d I raised my voice. I did not want to upset my mum but it was just weird that all this was happening exactly today. It was the 10th year death anniversary of my dad. The last thing I wanted is to lose another dad on the same day.\n\n\u201cJUST GO TO YOUR ROOM MARCUS!\u201d she screamed at me. \n\n\u201cFine!\u201d I spat, as the anger was building up in me and I spun and walked away but something just told me to stay behind and eavesdrop into the conversation. \n\n\u201cSee! Look what you have done! You have raised suspicion! Is this what we did all of this for? Is this why you brought me up here?! I spent 11 years! 11 years with you and your sickening son! I already told you to get rid of Marcus the same day you got rid of him but no! These people\u2026.. HA! People\u2026 These... These\u2026\u201d just as Cole was shouting at my mum, I heard the garage door open. \n\nNo one ever uses the garage door to enter apart from my dad. I quicken my pace and rushed into the garage only to see my dad walking in. \n\nMy dad who went missing for 10 years\u2026 \n\nMy dad who has been missing for 10 years\u2026\n\nWalking back into the house, like nothing has happened. Wearing the same clothes he did when he went missing 10 years ago\u2026\n\nI stopped on my tracks and stared as the imposter stared right back at me.\n\n\u201cWHO ARE YOU?!\u201d we both exclaimed almost at the same time.\n\nAnother minute of silence went by as tears started gather in my eyes.\n\n\u201cIs this some kind of sick joke? Who are you? Why are you dressed up like dad!\u201d I struggled to get my words out as I charged towards the intruder. \n\n\u201cKiddo? Kiddo, is that you? What the heck happened?! I was only gone for not more than half an hour to get the ciggs\u2026 Son, I have something to te-\u201d \n\nBefore I could land a solid punch on his face, I collided right into his chest as he wrapped his arms around me. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay kiddo! Daddy\u2019s back. Where is Colleen?\u201d \n\nI looked up at my dad, he had not aged a bit in the 10 years. I could not understand what I was witnessing but at the moment the only thing I could think of in his warm embrace was, \u201cI got my dad back\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe is in the kitchen with Cole,\u201d I responded wiping the tears off my face. \n\nWe both made our way back into the house. I had completely forgotten about the argument Cole and mum were having until I heard, \u201cbut he appeared back! He took my place! That is not possible, there is no-\u201c  \n\n\u201cJames?!\u201d \n\nMy mum looked like she had seen a ghost. Her faced had been drained of all the color while I saw Cole\u2019s expression getting angrier by the second. \n\n\u201cI know who you two are and I don\u2019t know what you did to me. Now that I am back, I will not let that happen again!\u201d My dad said it with such anger and assertion that I almost did not notice him cocking his gun. \n\nThat\u2019s when I noticed that pieces of the photograph on the counter top. The photograph of us, it seemed like there was some sort of glitch. Cole\u2019s face in the photograph was somehow merged with my dad\u2019s. It was a weird sight, nothing I have ever seen before in my 18 years. \n\nI looked up from the picture, distracted by the screaming of my mum when I saw my dad about to pull the trigger on Cole and my mum. \n\nAt this point, I was not thinking anymore. I did not know what was happening. My mind was racing; I could not let my mum die and let my dad go to jail. \n\n\u201cBANG!\u201d\n\nThe first shot went off, and I saw Cole slam onto the floor with a loud thud. \n\nPanic stricken, my hands instinctively moved cover to the drawer where my mum had hidden a gun for emergency uses only. \n\nJust as I loaded it, I turned back in time to witness my dad fire the second shot right at my mum before she fell colliding head first onto the marble floor. \n\nMy whole body went numb at the sight of my mum lying on the cold marble floor, motionless. \n\n\u201cMy dad would have never done that,\u201d was all I could mutter before I took the last shot.\n\nTears streamed down my face. \n\n\u201cSon\u2026..\u201d \n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nWas all I heard before I fell to the floor.\n\nThud.\n\nAnd everything faded to black.",

            "comment": "\"You look like you've seen a ghost.\" uttered the familiar figure. Indeed I have. The simple tan coat, red tie, and shoes as spotless as ever. \"Dad?\" I responded. \"Something wrong? Sorry I took a while.\" said my \"father\" in a clueless manner. There truly was something wrong. \"Where the hell were you! Mom loved you! She at least deserved an explanation!\" I shouted. This man who abandoned my mother and I for ten years expected what! A hug and a greeting? Who does he think he is? \n\n\"Well, son, if you can just calm down for a...\" \"No! How about you tell me what you were doing for the last decade looking for cigarettes!\" I retorted. \"Ten years! What are you talking about?\" the man questioned. \"Don't act like you don't know! You just went up and left me and mom!\" \"I've been gone for thirty minutes and you're acting like a damn drama queen.\" he said. \"Thirty minutes! Look around you! Does it seem like it's been thirty minutes?\" I said, pointing towards the interior of the house.\n\nHe looked around the shell of once a humble home. \"You know what, just come inside.\" I held my hand out. There was a moment of hesitation but he held it. Step by step, I led him through the house. He began to notice all the changes around the place, including me. \"Where did that come from? I guess I have been gone a long time.\" Well, that was obvious. I asked, calmly this time, \"Where were you... Dad?\" He seemed unsure yet confidently he said, \"I'm telling you, son, all I've done was pick up a few cigarettes.\" Are you kidding me? All of this time and this is what I get? I pushed onward with my father close behind. I let go of his hand once we've reached the living room. \"I should really talk to your mot-\" \"There.\" I remarked as I pointed towards the urn in the middle of the room. \"That's who you are looking for.\"\n\nHe looked at the urn aghast. \"Stop fooling around with me, Tom!\" he exclaimed at me. \"Tell me this is a joke! Tell me that this has got to be just another of your stupid pranks, Tom!\" He was clearly confused and angered. It took me a moment to realize that this was my dad, but why doesn't he just admit it? I had to live ten years without any answers, and now he's asking me more. I just sat down on the floor and gave up. \"When you left...\" I slowly said. \"...mom was so much more confused than I was. Now that she's gone, I don't have anyone else.\" The truth was I missed my dad, despite everything my mother told me. I was broken. I had nothing. \"But you still have me? Don't you?\" whispered my dad. He knelt down next to me. \"While I don't understand what's possibly going on, I still love you son, and nothing can change that.\" I was close to tears. \"Dad, I'm sorry bu...\" \"Hush.\" my father said welcoming me to a tight embrace. \"I'm here now, I'm back from the store.\" I chuckled a bit. No matter what happened he was still a dad. My dad. I hugged him back. A hug to make-up for the last ten years.\n\nEND.\n\n(15-year-old high school student here.

            "comment": "\u201cDad?\u201d\n\nSo many emotions began brewing inside the boy the second he saw his old man walk through the door. He was only 11 years old when his dad, his protector, his best friend, left their family.\n\nThe boy and his dad did everything together. They played catch, they played with action figures, anything, you name it. The boy did not have many friends in school, you see. He was picked on for being too short, for wearing glasses, for being a \u201cnerd\u201d. But him and his dad always had a special bond. Of course, the boy had a pretty good relationship with his mother and two sisters, but more so with his father.\n\nThat\u2019s what made his disappearance so hard to believe. For years, the boy wondered why. Why would his dad leave like this? One day, he told his family he needed more cigarettes, and then up and left. He never returned. The boy\u2019s mother fell into a deep depression. His sisters were sad, too. But the boy felt the pain the most.\n\nNow, the same man who left all those years ago was back, claiming it had only been 30 minutes. The boy froze. He didn\u2019t know what to think.\n\n\u201cDad?\u201d, he said again.\n\n\u201cWhy do you look so confused, slugger? I was only gone for half an hour.\u201d\n\nTears began to pour down the boy\u2019s face. He ran into the arms of his dad and hugged him, hugged him until he could hug no more.\n\nHis surroundings dissolved as he embraced his father\u2019s presence, and for a moment it felt as if his best friend never left. His mom was baking cookies in the kitchen, his sisters were playing dolls, and the boy and his father were playing catch in the backyard, just like back then. It was almost dreamlike. A nightmare, really.\n\nNothing had changed.\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Mom grabbed the shotgun and I grabbed the remote detonator. We had spent the last 10 years preparing for a potential assault. Mom was no Green Beret like dad was, but he had taught her some survival skills that she insisted on passing on to me when dad disappeared.\n\nThe plan was whoever was picking the lock right now would get a face full of buck shot, and if there were more behind him, mom would fire some suppression and then we'd use the back door to escape outside.\n\nOnce the intruders had entered the home, I'd blow it to bits using the simple C4 bricks mom had set up. Dad hadn't taught mom that trick, she learned that one all on her own. His disappearance had made us both paranoid. Whatever. Before he vanished, my dad could definitely beat up your dad. Now, my mom could.\n\nAll that mattered was that I felt safe. Until now.\n\nThe door's lock clicked, disengaging. It slowly opened.\n\nMom trembled, but kept her aim fixed on the doorway.\n\nThen, her eyes showed recognition and confusion all at once, and she fainted. The shotgun fell to the hard wood floor with a thud.\n\nMy heart sunk. I had no idea what she saw, but our plan was already toast. Mom was down. Had they hit her with a tranquilizer? Was there a silenced bullet? My mind raced at what to do next when I head a familiar voice carry through the door.\n\n\"Linda!\" shouted the voice, and then, for the first time in 10 years, my dad ran through the door to my mother.\n\nI stared in shock. Mom and I thought he had been kidnapped by his political opponents, taken to some cabin in the woods and killed. That was a sure way to stop the young, popular war hero from making the general election, after he had obliterated the competition in the primaries.\n\nBut here he was, in the same jeans and flannel shirt he had left in years ago when he went to buy cigarettes from the 7/11 on Main.\n\nDad picked up my mom and moved her to the couch in the living room. I rounded the corner slowly. It felt like I was being compelled to move toward him, like a magnet. My legs were moving, but I wasn't sure how, since my brain had been left on the landing.\n\n\"Dad?\" I said.\n\nHe looked up at me and I saw those familiar walnut eyes, and suddenly my brain rammed itself back into my head. \"It's really him! He's back,\" my inner voice squealed with glee. It was not the voice of 17-year-old me, but 7-year-old me. And I had just found something better and more elusive than Santa Clause in my living room. I found my dad.\n\nTears fell from my eyes as if someone had opened a dam somewhere.\n\nDad looked at me confused. But then his face turned soft.\n\n\"Jason,\" he said.\n\nIt wasn't a question. He knew me, even though I looked so different now. I had grown up.\n\nHe saw the detonator in my hand, but he didn't say anything else. He just reached out to me inviting me in. I put the detonator on the coffee table and ran to him. He drew me in with his right arm and held me while we both cried.\n\n\\---",

It was getting cold, so my dad, ever the survivor, lit a fire in the fireplace rather than using the central air.\n\nHe sat down, half his face orange with the warm fire light, the other half shrouded in darkness. He held his hands up, finger tips together and resting on his lips. This was his thinking pose. I really missed that pose.\n\n\"Tell me you remember *something* from the past ten years,\" pleaded mom.\n\nI could tell she was afraid. Maybe whoever had kidnapped him hadn't meant for him to escape. That they'd be after him soon, *now even*, and this time, they'd get the job done permanently.\n\nDad closed his eyes. I could see his pupils dancing behind those eyelids, frantically searching. And then they stopped.\n\n\"It could have been Williams, Channy, or Upton,\" he said.\n\n\"Except that Williams didn't win, Channy pulled out of the race, and Upton took a position in the private sector,\" said mom.\n\nThe green party candidate had won the Senate seat 10 years ago, by default. Every one else had either dropped out or, in my dad's case, disappeared. It had been a very weird election year in Wisconsin. But, six years later, the by-default green-party senator was reelected because he proved to be no different than the Democratic senator would have been anyway.\n\nMom got up and went to the kitchen. She came back with a pitcher of ice cold water and three glasses. She poured each of us a drink. My dad thanked her and then set his glass on the side table next to his old chair, where he sat as if he had never left it.\n\n\"Ah ah ah!\" mom scolded. Then she tossed him an old junk mail envelope we had never opened to put under his drink like she had done so many times before. Old habits. Dad never liked using the mail as a coaster, but mom hated the ring stains his glasses would leave on the wood. But both my parents were too cheap to buy coasters, so mail it was.\n\nDad caught the junk mail out of the air and then sniffed in front of him. I almost chuckled because mom always thought that those Upton mailers were so cheesy. The former candidate had gone into developing and selling top-of-the-line safes and security boxes. Upton had even boasted about how the secret service had installed Upton panic rooms in former presidents' homes. You'd think someone with a background in public speaking would have better taste, but Upton's mailers smelled obviously of Tabu perfume. She must have had each letter spritzed with the sweet-smelling stuff. Mom used to say, \"Oh wow! What a sexy safe!\"\n\nDad smelled the envelope and closed his eyes.\n\n\"What is it, hon?\" mom asked.\n\nDad didn't say anything, but he opened his eyes and looked at the envelope.\n\n\"I know who kidnapped me,\" he said, evenly.\n\nMom's eyes opened wide and then narrowed. She knew who he was thinking of.\n\n\"Upton?\" she said, pissed. \"I wrote that sonofabitch off because she never touched politics after the primaries!\"\n\nDad nodded. He looked into the glowing fire place.\n\n\"I *did* get the cigarettes that day. I had bought them and asked the cashier for the key to the bathroom. I remember standing at the urinal and this perfume wafting into the bathroom behind me,\" he said, lifting the envelope.\n\n\"And then I remember walking down the street back home today. I felt disoriented. What had happened since I had peed and where I was on the side walk? I tried to remember, but could only recall a dream I had of a small room with some furniture and a bed and no windows.\"\n\n\"A panic room,\" I said, swallowing the knot in my throat.\n\nDad smiled at me, proud.\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nMom had a confused look on her face.\n\n\"But why did she let you go? Isn't she afraid that you'll expose her?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not if *she* didn't let me go,\" dad said. \"Think about it, why would she kidnap me, just to pull out of the Senate race, and then suddenly release me ten years later?\"\n\n\"She's working with someone else?\" I said.\n\nDad shook his head.\n\n\"Sort of. But who else would want me free? Who could even do that? Who has the resources to find out where I was and how to get me out of a panic room?\"\n\nMy head hurt trying to work out all the answers. I got no where. I could tell my mom was feeling just as frustrated.\n\n\"Mack,\" dad said.\n\nMack was dad's old Green Beret buddy who currently worked at the Secret Service. He had kept in touch regularly over the years since my dad had disappeared, until about 6 months ago, when he suddenly stopped calling to check in on us.\n\n\"Mack?!\" mom nearly shouted his name. \"Well if Mack let you out, why didn't he bring you here and explain this all himself? Why didn't he say anything?\"\n\nMom pulled out her cell phone.\n\n\"Damn it. Mack called 8 hours ago. Three times,\" she said. \"Must have been on silent. No message though.\"\n\n\"That would have been a couple of hours before I found myself walking home,\" dad said.\n\n\"Why the hell didn't he bring you here?\" mom said.\n\n\"Well, maybe he didn't want to raise suspicions,\" I said. \"If he still works his old shift, he would've had to lie to get out of work tonight, right? And then maybe...other people would have caught wind of it?\"\n\nDad smiled at me again.\n\nHe said, \"Upton may work in the private sector, but how do you think she got those presidential contracts? She's working with someone pretty high up. My money's on Michaelson, the Senator who won the year I disappeared.\"\n\n\"The green party Senator?\" mom said.\n\nDad scoffed, \"Just how green has he turned out to be?\"\n\n\"Well, he's more blue than green...and he's hinted at a presidential run in a couple of years.\"\n\nDad looked at mom's cell phone, thinking. Even amidst all this talk of danger I found myself smiling again, watching him push those finger tips together and rest them on his pursed lips. It's amazing how much you can appreciate the little things about a person who has been gone so long.\n\n\"Text Mack. Say this *exactly*: \"Thanks for the gift you left on my doorstep. Let's meet up soon. Should we visit Uptown? And then stop at the Michael's on the way back?\"\n\nMom shook her head and just handed the phone to my dad instead.\n\nHe texted and then put the phone down on the table.\n\nMom said, \"That was a pun wasn't it? *Uptown* is Upton? *Michaels' on the way* is Michaelson?\"\n\nDad nodded his head.\n\n\"Pun? I like to think of it as code.\"\n\nHe winked.\n\nJust then, the phone buzzed.",

And then we'll all be in danger.\"\n\n\"So we have to get the drop on him and Michaelson,\" I said. \n\nDad looked at me and frowned. \n\n\"I don't want to bring either of you into this, but I can't leave you here. I think you'll be safer with me and Mack.\"\n\nMom shook her head, threw her hands up and yelled at dad. \"This is crazy!\" \n\nAnd then she stood up and walked back into the kitchen. \n\nDad sighed.

            "comment": "I sat in the middle of the room, staring blankly at the television, my father's favorite song playing in the background. It is that time of the year again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmoke gradually fogged up the room, a pack of cigarette opened and empty on the table top. *Marlboro.* I started smoking when I was sixteen years old, the day he left the house, never to return. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Off to buy a pack of cigarettes.\" he said, leaving with just the keys to the house and some chump change, not a care in the world. Wearing his plain old T-shirt, worn-out trousers and flip-flops, his backdrop vanished out of the doorway, while sixteen years old me waved him goodbye from the television couch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day. Two days. Mum began to get worried. She went down to the convenience store down by the street. They did not see my father. She went to the neighbors. They did not see my father. She called the workplace. They did not see my father. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree days. Four days. Mum called the police, filing a missing person report. Fear started to settle into my chest. There, it claws and gnaws at me, eating me out from the inside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMum began digging through my father's stuff, hoping to find a clue as to where he went. None. There was nothing. His credit cards, his identification papers, the keys to his car, it is all here. For all intents and purposes, he vanished. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne month. Our world began to collapse. He is gone. He is *gone.* He is never coming back. They could not find him. We could deny it no longer. We no longer had a father. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat day, I went out to buy my first pack of cigarettes. Holding it in my hand, I cried, for the first time since he disappeared, tears dripping down to form coin-sized droplets on the parking lot behind the convenience store. Trembling, I took one stick of cigarette out, lighting it with a lighter, and took my first puff. It burns and suffocates me, smoke tearing up my lungs, yet, for a brief moment in time, it seems as if he was going to come back after all. Crying, smoking, sobbing, I burnt through the first cigarette of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMum began working as a dishwasher at the diner the following months, hoping to earn an income to support the family. With our father gone, we lost our sole breadwinner, and our savings are running out. We begin to cut out non-essential necessities - gone were the days where we could afford to spend our money on restaurant meals and trips. Things start breaking down and we have no money to fix them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlcohol started coming into our lives. My mum began to drink. One bottle. Two bottles. Three bottles. The floor became littered with Budweisers, each bottle representing a temporary getaway from what our lives had become. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne year. He has gone missing for one whole year. Smoking became a daily habit for me. My results have been slipping drastically, I lost my chance to get a scholarship at the college of my dreams. Mum began to come home later and later, drinking more and more, the house becoming more disorganized, more decrepitated. The heater has been spoiled for close to three months, the dishwasher spoiled for two. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the same day he went missing, the both of us, Mum and I, sat around the living room and cried. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFive years. Mum has been dating someone else for close to a year now. I flunked out of college and began taking odd jobs around town for some cash, working at the bottom of the barrel for minimum wage. My new potential step-dad is the owner of the diner. Mum no longer wept on the day he goes missing. His stuff is now packed in cartons and locked up in the attic. Things began to change for the better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill, though, on the day he left, I would still wonder what happened to him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEight years. I am the only one living in the house now. My Mum moved out of the house to live with her new husband, who also happened to have kids of her own. I met them. Zackary and Daniel, ten and thirteen respectively. At least she is not drinking as heavily now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have gotten into a trade school, currently training to be a plumber. It pays more than what I have been working as for the past few years. I met someone I really liked at the trade school. Maybe I should try to confess to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still wait for him the day he left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPresent. I burnt through the cigarette, smoldering it in the ashtray. The day is coming to an end. I gaze at the door. No one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI began to chuckle, before it turned into a roaring laughter, before it became a cry, before it became a despairing wail, my fist pounding on the worn-out cushion in pain and agony, cries of a wounded animal echoing through the room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He is never coming back, is he? He is gone, just like that, for close to ten years. Ten. I should have given up long ago...I really should have...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe door opens. I stop in the midst of my tracks. Footsteps, echoing in the walkway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I am back. Oh gosh...why is the house full of smoke?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPossessed, I turn my head around. There he is, in the same plain old T-shirt and trousers, carrying a bag of cigarettes, waving his hand around the house, exactly the way I remembered it ten years ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stood up, got out of my the couch, went over and gave him one big hug. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Dad...you are back. Finally. You are back.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*I lied*. I am sorry. *I lied*. I am sorry. *I lied*. \n\n*He will not be becoming back, won't he?* I looked at the cigarette in my hand, offering it to my father. *He is gone, isn't he?* \n\nHe took the cigarette from me. *Yes, he is gone. You knew it a long time ago, didn't you?* Taking a deep puff, he pointed at the door. *He will not be coming back.* \n\nI sighed. *Of course. I always knew, wasn't it? Thanks, Pappy.* \n\nHe passed the cigarette back. *No problems, son. Good to see you again, for one last time.* \n\nI knew. I knew, yet I waited. I looked at the cigarette in my hand. Everyone has moved on but me. \n\nI took one last puff, before grounding the final cigarette into the ashtray. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I don\u2019t wanna believe what I\u2019m seeing, but it\u2019s right in front of me. My so called \u201cdeadbeat\u201d father was here and back.\n\n\u201cDad is that you?\u201d I asked reluctantly\n\n\u201cUm kiddo?\u201d\n\nHe walk into the house some more. I seriously don\u2019t believe it and he can\u2019t either. But he\u2019s more naive than surprised as I am.\n\n\u201cWoah. Shit I\u2019m sorry this is embarrassing.\u201d He says as he finally see\u2019s me\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I asked\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t my house sorry about that young man, our house looks the same I guess, weird that my key works for this house though. You should probably go get that fixed or something.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m very shocked, but I don\u2019t know wether it\u2019s because I\u2019m now just seeing my father again after 10 years or my father\u2019s a total idiot and he doesn\u2019t recognize his 18 year old son after all those 10 years.\n\n\u201cUuummm are you fucking serious right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWoah woah woah, it\u2019s an honest mistake don\u2019t get mad now I seriously thought this was my house, look I\u2019ll just leave sorry for the intrusion.\u201d\n\nOh fuck he\u2019s leaving, but I don\u2019t know what to say it\u2019s really like he\u2019s not my father anymore he left us for 10 years my mom was devastated and I was just forced to grow up faster. What do I do? I\u2019m sweating because it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen him I want to hate him but I want to love him too.\n\n\u201cDAD!\u201d I screamed\n\nHe stops moving. It\u2019s kind of weird actually because he just stopped mid walking and was reaching for the door.\n\n\u201cDad it\u2019s me... Jacob... y-your son.\u201d I said sadly\n\n\u201cJacob? No way.\u201d He said astonished\n\nHe turns around to look at me\n\n\u201cIs this a joke to you? How do you know my son\u2019s name? What you like watching 8 year olds or something creep?\u201d He said angrily\n\n\u201cNo, wait what? I\u2019m your son... look it\u2019s me Jakey.\u201d\n\nHe looks mad still I think he\u2019s about to kick my ass. He really must not believe me or something. I have to think of something, but what? Mom\u2019s removed everything single thing about him and I gotta think.\n\n\u201cOk bud listen here stay the hell away from me, my family, and especially my so-\u201c\n\n\u201cWAIT! Stop. Look stay right here please don\u2019t leave I have something that\u2019ll convince you\u201d\n\nI dashed across the living room and sprinted into my room as fast as I could. I was looking for the one thing I know he\u2019ll remember. It\u2019s a little weird to have kid stuff in my room, but they were stuff I had to remember by dad by and I wasn\u2019t letting my mom destroy it.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon where is it? I swore I saw it like a week ago. AH-HA FOUND IT!\u201d\n\nI ran back to my uneasy and a little irritated father, but his eyes widened  when I showed him the signed football I got hit by when I was only 5.\n\n\u201cHow did you get this?\u201d He ask nervously\n\n\u201cRemember we went to that football game when I was 5? My favorite player scored and he threw a ball into the crowd and I tried catching it, but it hit my face instead, so he decided to sign the ball for us as a sorry.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s very puzzled by the look on his face, but also surprised as well.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t get it... that happened 3 years ago.\u201d He said shockingly \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? That happened like at least 13 years ago.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s pale and scared and shocked I thought he was joking, but he\u2019s genuinely scared about something.\n\n\u201cSon... I-I\u2019ve only...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it dad?\u201d I asked\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only been gone for half an hour.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s very scared to find himself in a situation like this, I wanna say he\u2019s joking, but looking at his out of date clothing and his ageless look he\u2019s very much not joking.\n\n\u201cLast time I saw you, you were 8, like literally 30 minutes ago is the last time I saw you. So if that ball thing happened 13 years ago for you that\u2019s would make you... 18!\u201d\n\n\u201cUuuhhh yeah you were gone for 10 years.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s sweating a little, looks as if he\u2019s gonna faint from this news, but he keeps himself together and decides to speak.\n\n\u201c10... 10 long years I was gone? I don\u2019t understand how... Oh fuck your mother, the love of my life and you going through your pre-teen years and plus puberty! I wasn\u2019t there for you or your mother, but that was all half an hour ago for me. Where is your mother anyways?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably out somewhere at some bar.\u201d I said all casually\n\n\u201cShe drinks now?!? She\u2019s never drank before, she\u2019s my beautiful angel.\u201d He said surprisingly \n\n\u201cWell dad you were gone for 10 years call it crazy, but she waited for you for the first 5 years. She said that you were everything to her and that she\u2019s your world and that y\u2019all were soulmates from the first time y\u2019all met. She loved you and when you didn\u2019t come back she never let anyone to her life. Like I mean a lot of weird guys, rich dudes, and plain average joes wanted to be with her, but she preferred a bottle of whiskey over anyone else.\u201d\n\nHe took a seat on the couch and closed his eyes. He opened them and looked at me.\n\n\u201cWhat happened? What am I gonna do now? I should\u2019ve never went out for those damn cigarettes! I was supposed to stop smoking anyways because we were thinking of having another kid, but my dumbass wanted a daily dose of fucking nicotine.\u201d\n\nHe sat there on the couch I\u2019ve missed him a lot, but he\u2019s really been gone for so long it\u2019s just all alien for this to be happening.\n\n\u201cDad... maybe you should actually leave, like for real this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously? That\u2019s your solution?\u201d He said smart assidly\n\n\u201cWell to us you were gone for 10 years and I mean you being back would just change everything. I\u2019ve missed you a lot and mom does too, but seeing you haven\u2019t aged a day and still somewhat youthful you could just live a new life.\u201d\n\nHe got up and looked at me tears in his eyes and looked around the house.\n\n\u201cI was only gone for 30 minutes I don\u2019t know if I can be gone for longer than that. I love you and your mother, but it\u2019s true what you\u2019re saying, me being back would disrupt a lot of what you guys have. The best thing now is to let this role play out.\u201d\n\nTears filled my eye and so did his. We both came together and hugged each other tightly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed you a lot dad and I\u2019m gonna miss you some more, but at least I know you weren\u2019t a deadbeat dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you a lot son and your mom she was my everything and so are you, but now I guess I\u2019ll take the title of deadbeat father and leave... leave for real this time I mean.\u201d\n\nAfter the hugging I walked him out the house he got back in his truck and drove away. Not too long after my mom comes home. I didn\u2019t tell her that dad came back because I didn\u2019t want her destroying herself again and getting her hopes high to see dad, but after that day he came back the following years I\u2019ve gotten presents sent to me on my birthday, and my mom too, and every year on her anniversary she gets gifts with the same note that reads \u201cI will always love you dearly my beautiful angel.\u201d Good job trying to be discreet dad, but my mom is just as naive as him, but at least she stopped drinking. Who would\u2019ve figured that my \u201cdeadbeat\u201d father is the best father.",

            "comment": "When I was very young, I had absolutely no idea what my father's career was. Mother stayed at home and took care of us, so my brother and sisters took to her more than my father, who disappeared from the house pretty often. You might see stuff on TV about kids asking their parents what they're doing when they go away for 8+ hours a day, or ask them about this enigmatic thing called 'work', that is somehow both a location and an activity. We were no exception to this standard.\n\nBut what may have been exceptional about my dad, is that whenever I asked about his profession it was always a different answer. Sometimes the answers made sense, like when he said he was a 'contractor' and he did odd jobs for the government. Other times they made less sense, like when he said he was going out to 'help someone finish their autobiography'. One day he might work for a couple of hours and spend the rest of it at home; another day he might leave before sunrise and not come back until midnight. Other times he'd leave on week long business trips. It all confused me and I asked him more than a few times to see if I could get a clearer understanding.\n\nWell, Dad must have either caught on to my confusion or realized he wasn't satisfying my curiosity, because one of his replies went something like, \"Son, I know that you just want to make sure that I'm not sneaking off and having fun without you, but my job is... complicated. I think you're smart enough to understand that sometimes I have to stretch the truth about what I do in order to keep things smooth here at home. My job involves some funny people\u2014people who aren't always right in the head. You know what; get me that pad of paper and a pen off the counter over there.\"\n\nI obligingly strode over and retrieved the items, handing them to him upon returning.\n\n\"I know that you don't like it when I go out for a long time and disappear from the house. So I'm going to write you a list of codewords for us to communicate in, so you know when I'm gone, how serious the job is, and how long until I get back. Now, I might have some tough days at the office and won't come back on time, but I promise that I will always come back.\"\n\nDad and I spent the rest of the morning coming up with code phrases and passwords. For some reason he never carried a key and mom always had to let him in after checking to see who just rang the doorbell in a 2-1-3 pattern. We always knew it was him, since no other wacko ever rang doorbells like that, but still mom checked the door before opening, no matter who it was. Dad and I made a list of what I now recognize to be codes and counters. He'd figure out some way to get the code to me, writing stuff onto the grocery list or circling things in the newspaper with red marker, stuff like that. I'd check with the notebook and ask for the password when he showed up at the door later.\n\nThis went on for a year, until one morning I was looking for Dad in his office. He always went to work dressed in a black suit, coat, and a purple tie. The coat and purple tie were missing from the coat hanger in the corner. I found a hastily scribbled note on his desk that said \"Went out for a pack of cigarettes.\" I knew this to be the code for a job that was absolutely safe and he'd be back in 30 minutes or less. It didn't look like Dad's handwriting to me, but I knew that nobody else had knew about the codes, not even my mother or my siblings. I assumed he was in a hurry and went about my day. After a day and a half of his absence I began to worry. I shared my concerns, and the codes, with my mother and she just reassured me that he'd be fine, and it wouldn't be much longer until he returned.\n\nA week went by.\n\nA month.\n\n\\[Continued in reply\\]",

                    "comment": "Mother started letting other guys into the house. She stopped wearing her wedding band when they were around. Another month and she stopped wearing it altogether. My siblings weren't close to him, and they didn't really mention him much at all. I missed Dad a lot around that time, but even I was having a hard time holding on to his presence. \n\nA year went by and mother was marrying to another guy, Chad. This journal isn't about me, it's about my dad, so I'm going to leave details about my life a little scarce here. Just know that Chad was a man who worked hard to achieve the level of overpowering douchebag he embodied. It impresses me to this day, how much of a dull and throbbing tool he was. I often saw him bring other girls to our 3-floor, 8-bedroom house, while mother was away on errands. These women were sometimes barely dressed, one time not dressed at all. My brothers would always gawk at them (they were older than me, 15 and 17, and I was 11) and they often dragged me along to sneak peeks, but I was just sort of weirded out since I wasn't sexually attracted to girls yet. Chad and bimbo invariably disappeared into the basement. We weren't allowed down there, and one had to go up to at least the second floor to avoid the noises.\n\nChad tried to give me the run-down on sex once, but his fierce douchery overcame him, forcing an implosion of his insignificant rational mind, and he had to excuse himself halfway through showing me some video on a website with a bunch of X's at the top to go into the bathroom with his laptop for 5 minutes and \"relieve himself\". Stay classy, Chad.\n\nI ended up finding an anatomy book in Dad's office and sort of teaching myself about being a teen. Mother didn't really want to deal with his stuff and the house was large enough to ignore the room entirely. She covered some of the office's furniture with sheets and left boxes of Dad's stuff inside. Nobody ever went in unless to deposit more of Dad's things in the boxes.\n\nI ran away a couple years after that.\n\nI remembered Dad saying that he often worked under a different name so people didn't bother him at home. I decided to borrow that idea. I stole some money, an expensive-looking watch, and a bank card from Chad's safe (password was 1-2-3-4, unsurprisingly). I was mostly clueless and relying on what I'd seen from movies and stuff, but I managed to figure out Chad's PIN (again 1-2-3-4) and ended up with a backpack full of about 20 thousand dollars with the money from Chad's safe and as many ATMs as I could find before leaving the state. I took several busses, making sure to change periodically to make myself harder to track, and ended up in a small town a couple of states to the north.\n\nI paid for a small apartment with the cash I had. It wasn't much compared to where I was living, but I was vastly more content with it than living with mother and Chad. I transferred into the local high school by means of lackadaisical bureaucracy, some lies about my parents being really busy and working all the time, some large cash incentives, and more than a few forgeries of Chad's signature (to be honest, mine looked better than the real thing).\n\nI went through all of high school on Chad's money, sold the watch online at a decent discount from what it was worth and ended up with another 3 thousand dollars in Bitcoin, which turned into... well, a **lot** more. By the time I was twenty, I was putting myself through college with my small fortune. I had already gone through missing, then hating, then forgiving Dad by this time. He had become all but a distant memory. Until someone rang the doorbell one afternoon.\n\n*Di-ding-dong, ding-dong, di-di-ding dong. 2-1-3.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[continued 2/3\\]",

                            "comment": "I almost died right there. My heart froze, my stomach buzzed, my head went silent, and my ears rang as I heard the last three notes of the specific sequence humm in through my apartment. I put down the criminology textbook and cautiously approached the door. I checked the peephole and I gaped at the sight of a familiar coat and a purple tie, matched with a simple black suit. He was standing too close to the door and I couldn't see his face. I swallowed hard to saturate my dry throat and eked out my countercall from memory.\n\n\"Did you bring the cigarettes?\"\n\nThe man patted the breast of his jacket. \"Got em' right here, kid! Let me in before I freeze to death.\"\n\nThat wasn't the right password, but it was a long time ago. I figured he could have forgot. I hesitantly unlatched and unlocked the door, turning the handle and cracking it open slowly. Cold air flooded into my doorway, but I was numb entirely numb to it. The thing that made my skin crawl was the pistol pointed at chest, a long black cylinder protruding off the barrel to let me know that I was dealing with a professional. I glanced up at the face and saw it for the first time; young, tall, and the entirely wrong ethnicity to be my dad.\n\nHe dropped the southern drawl from earlier and spoke in a light Italian accent. \"Sorry, kiddo. Your dad was a problem for us and we don't know how much he told you, so we gotta make sure you don't become one as well. It's just business, I'm afraid.\"\n\nI closed my eyes and felt my resignation. It was not my dad who had come to the door, it was death. Death had knocked on my door wearing the guise of my lost father, and I welcomed him in like an idiot. I heard the safety click and felt the cold steel of the barrel against my forehead, felt warm tears run down my cheeks and freeze around my chin. I thought of Dad. Maybe there was an afterlife. Maybe I'd see him there. Maybe I'd dream in my death and I'd be with him again. Forever.\n\nI heard some shuffling before me. A strained groan from the man in front of me. I opened my eyes.\n\nAnother man stood behind the guy with the gun. My assassin's throat was wrapped in a gray steel wire and a familiar hand held the gunman's wrist up, pointing the gun into the ceiling. Without thinking, without any hesitation I reached up, slammed the gunman's wrist against the door frame, knocking the gun out of his hand and onto the floor. The hitman was trying to fend off the man behind him with his other arm but getting seemingly nowhere. He raised both hands now and put them around my throat, trying desperately to finish me off before he lost consciousness. His grip was strong, overpowering, but noticeably weakened. The man behind him pulled him back out of the doorway and doubled his pressure on the wire around his attacker's throat. He gagged and spasmed for a couple of seconds longer and then he was gone.\n\nI slid down against the wall and watched as the other man rose, wearing exactly the same clothing, wearing the same purple tie, wearing that familiar face that my father had, a bit more aged than before. He walked into the doorway, stepping over the body. He knelt down in front of my teary face, put his hand on my shoulder, and spoke in that familiar voice of his.\n\n\"Son, you know I don't smoke,\" he smiled.",

            "comment": "We had grown accustomed to not seeing him sitting at the dining room table reading the morning newspaper before breakfast. At least that what I\u2019d tell myself. He\u2019d just sit there hidden behind articles, and only his hand would occasionally, reach for his cup of freshly brewed coffee. The hand would disappear with the mug behind the paper after a few sips it would reappear and put the cup back on the table. Freeing the hand to flip the page. He\u2019d always have the whole house smelling like coffee. I don\u2019t know how he and mom could stand it, but nowadays I kind of miss it. Mom would be behind him, cooking our breakfast and our lunches for the day. When she\u2019d cook, the house would smell of eggs and bacon. Mm, the aroma of greatness. But even that doesn\u2019t happen as often anymore. When I come down the stairs in the hall, I see the ghost of days past. Creeping down the steps before school, just hoping I\u2019d see him sitting at the table again through the doorway to the kitchen from the hall.\n\nWhen I come down stairs these days, there\u2019s a note left on the table in front of a plate of cold breakfast with a glass cover over it. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your lunch is in the fridge, Love, Mom.\u201d It says. The kitchen is just as cold as my breakfast is by the time I wake up, get down stairs, and eat. I\u2019d sit, there scooping at the cold eggs, not bothering to reheat the food, but instead stare at the backyard door dad would stand at to smoke his cigarettes, before mom would call him to come eat. Now we hardly ever open those sliding doors. Though, ever since I stole the seat dad used to sit in at our small, square, kitchen table. I always imagine he\u2019s still there. Taking a smoke before breakfast. Just waiting for him to come back inside and say, \u201cHey, you got your own seat kiddo.\u201d As he\u2019d smile and wave me to my seat.\n\nThen that sweeping anger swells in me like every other time I get to this point.\n\nBut if he didn\u2019t smoke, he would be gone!\nHe would never have left! \nHe would be here!\nIt's all the cigarettes fault he never came back!\n\nThis always happens. It reaches the point of realization that, I took out my anger on cigarettes, and blamed them for my fathers disappearance. Though, It was my fault\u2026 ten years ago, we had a drug awareness guest speaker in my class. He told us all about how bad cigarettes are, so when I got home that day, I thought I\u2019d help my dad quit by sneaking into my parent\u2019s bedroom, grabbing his pack of cigarettes, and throwing them away for him. I was sure he\u2019d quit if his cigarettes just weren\u2019t there anymore. But the next morning, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back, just going to go buy some more cigarettes.\u201d My mission to get him to quit smoking backfired. And\u2026 He never come home after that. Mom called the police, and they searched for days, weeks, for any signs of him or his car. But nothing turned up. Eventually they called off the search, and just like my appetite just seemed to call off for thinking of all that. It was time for school anyway, so I grabbed my stuff hanging off the back of the chair I was supposed to be sitting in, and then my lunch before heading towards the front door.\n\nThough as I was entering the hall from the kitchen the front door unlocked itself, and it opened.\n\n\u201cW-Who are you, and how did you get in my house!?\u201d he shouted, dropping his bag to the floor. Three packs of cigarettes slid out of the bag onto the hall floor. He was wearing the same clothes as that day.\n\n\u201cDad?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I know you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, your daughter!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, my daughter is only six years old!, I\u2019m calling the police!\u201d He said stomped towards me to get to the phone we kept in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cDad, no! Seriously it's me! You\u2019ve been gone for ten years!\u201d\n\nHe walks into the kitchen. He was looking for the wired phone we used to have hanging on the wall next to the door frame. Now we have a cordless phone sitting on the counter on the other side of the fridge. Though he couldn\u2019t see it.\n\n\u201cWhat? Where did the house phone go? Did you vandalize my property? Hid my phone away, so we can\u2019t call the police in case you got caught here?\u201d\n\n\u201cDad, I\u2019m serious it's me! I\u2019m still the same girl! Your little summer sunshine!\u201d\n\nHe looked at me, investigate every inch of my face. He walked closer and stared deep into my eyes.\n\n\u201cYou do kind look like my wife, but\u2026 but that would be impossible\u2026\u201d He lifted his wrist watch, and checked the time, \u201cI\u2019ve only been gone for half an hour?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore like half an hour and thirty minutes.\u201d\n\nHe walked over to the kitchen table as if in a daze. He hovered over the kitchen table hold himself up with his hands propped on the table.\n\n\u201cThen\u2026 Where is your mother?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince you\u2019ve been gone for so long, she had to get a job to keep up with the bills,\u201d I paused for a moment, Mom has a cell phone, so I thought it might be best to call and let her speak to him. \u201cI can call mom if you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, do that\u2026\u201d he said, still hunched over the table, dazed.\n\nI called mom, but instead of her speaking with dad over the phone she insisted that she had to come home and see for herself. About forty-five minutes later, the front door swings open, her keys jingling wildly as she storms into the kitchen, finding us standing in an awkward silence. She walks over to dad, looks him up and down, then gives him a good slap on the face.\n\n\u201cWhere the hell have you been for the past ten years!? Do you\u2026 Do you know what you put this family through!\u201d she choked up in disbelief and tears. She dropped her keys, then fell to her knees. She had always told me, If he ever showed back up, she would give dad a piece of her mind. But even I started tearing up when I realized he was back, he was actually back after all this time. He knelt down and lift mom back to her feet and held her in his arms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He hesitated, but he then explained to mom the same thing he explained to me, but instead he even showed her his watch.\n\nDad always wore one of those fancy sports watches that kept track of time, date and altitude. It was a pretty cool sports watch even if it was a bit dated by today\u2019s standards. Since we have smart watches and all. However, on the watch it was still the same date as when he first disappeared. He walked us outside to even show us the mileage on the car which read less than ten miles had been put on the car\u2019s odometer. And the store he went to is only five miles away, so it was just a trip there and back.\n\nMom stood confused, she didn\u2019t understand. Nor did I.\n\n\u201cHow did you disappear for ten years then?\u2026 this makes little sense.\u201d Mom had asked the question I\u2019m sure we all wanted answered at this point.",

Any civilians seen approaching the Green Zone will be turned away by agents disguised as police. Civilians are to be told there is an environmental hazard ahead, and be given an appropriate detour. Civilians who do not comply with instructions given are to be apprehended and released in the nearest city.\n\nThe Red Zone is fenced-in, marked two (2) mile radius around SCP-3160. No unauthorized individuals are to enter the designated Red Zone. All unauthorized on-site staff seen entering the Red Zone will be apprehended, given C-class Amnestics, and a psych evaluation.\n\nAny unauthorized individuals seen interacting with SCP-3160 directly are to be shot by designated snipers posted on the edge of the Red Zone.\n\nAny individuals seen exiting SCP-3160 must be detained, questioned, and given A-class Amnestics before being released.\n\nDescription: SCP-3160 is a small, rural town in [REDACTED], Wisconsin. No civic records exist before 1848 for reasons still unclear. \n\nSCP-3160 consists of one (1) library, one (1) police station, one (1) fire station, one (1) convenience store (hereon labelled as SCP-3160-1) with an 'open' sign, one (1) town hall, and thirty (30) homes fit for families of up to four (4), (hereon labelled SCP-3160-2). All buildings within SCP-3160\n\nSCP-3160's anomalous effects appear when a family of one (1) adult male, one (1) adult female, and one (1) child of memory forming age move into SCP-3160-2. The adult male will be labelled as SCP-3160-3\n\nThe father figure within the residence will develop a smoking habit, regardless of prior history or medical status within one (1) to four (4) weeks. The father figure will show neglectful behavior of the family unit after one (1) to two (2) months, leaving for extended hours or ignoring members of the family more than previously known.\n\nUpon having lived in SCP-3160 as a cohesive family unit for one (1) year, Event 3160-A will occur.\n\nEvent 3160-A is a spacially anomalous event, in which SCP-3160-3 will leave the family dwelling, stating \"I'm going out to get a pack of smokes.\" Upon closing the door, SCP-3160 will vanish. At the same time, SCP-3160-1's sign will turn over, declaring itself closed. No individuals have been seen to close the sign or attend the store while it is closed. \n\nAfter an undeterminant period of time, SCP-3160-3 will emerge from SCP-3160-1 without any change of appearance and will be carrying a pack of [REDACTED] brand cigarettes. The length  of time that instances of Event 3160-A have taken have ranged from thirty (30) minutes to ten (10) years. The cigarettes have shown no anomalous qualities. Upon exiting SCP-3160-1, Event 3160-A will end. SCP-3160-3's smoking habits after the event will remain, but can be broken through rehabilitation. \n\nRecovered instances of SCP-3160-3 have reported remaining in SCP-3160-1 for no more than five (5) minutes. They have reported no clerks or store attendants during their purchase, and instead there is some form of self checkout appropriate to the time period, including a wicker basket containing a note stating \"Pay here\", a fully electronic self-checkout device, and an instant message sent to SCP-3160-3's phone. \n\nEntering SCP-3160-1 when Event 3160-A is inactive is possible, and has revealed a dilapidated and abandoned storefront with no anomalous effects. Attempting to enter SCP-3160-1 during Event 3160-A is impossible.",

Emotions washed over me the same as they had throughout the ten years he was absent, but this time all at once. I stuttered and briefly questioned reality. He looked the same as he did the day he left; a worn out car salesman in a thrift corduroy brown suit accessorized with a leather briefcase grandpa gifted him. It was clearly out of place. He paid little attention to self care, and it reflected in almost everything he was. He lived somewhere in between making his own choices and leaving them up to something else. It was as if he was in some sort of denial about his reality, and he was waiting for something great to save him. Occasionally he displayed charged acts of self control, determination and ambition. He paid attention to my life in brief fleeting segments. They were always short lived. I can recall the details of that night because I replayed them so many times over. I could still smell the alcohol on him. There was the familiar warm musk cologned over the type of sweat that only stunk of something stale and stagnant. But oddly, I missed that smell. Relief washed over as the salty sea air carried his musk in as the door opened casually. He appeared to pay no mind to his absence. My tears rolled meeting my lips. Dad was home, but where had he been all these years? Why did he look mostly the same? One important detail caught my eye. Something unfamiliar. A black stone. He held it in his hands as his shoes brought in a fine white powder that dirtied our floors. His eyes sparkled. ",

Open it, or just leave it unopened?  Is opened presumptuous?  Maybe she'd want to open it.  You know, inspect it.  You never can be too safe these days.\"\n\nThe questions you'd like to have asked your... dad, well not me, not my dad.  I mean, I loved the guy and he really liked me as well.  But we didn't have that kind of relationship.  Not like he had with my older brother.  Connor was the really handsome, athletic type.  Star football player, prom king.  I was more into building model space ships.   He went into the Marines after High School.  God, I loved that guy.  He was killed in Afghanistan three years later and it wrecked me.\n\nWrecked my dad as well.   The old man just flat walked out on mom, me, and my three older sisters about a month after we found out.  Went for that proverbial \"pack of cigarettes\" and never came back.  The guy didn't even smoke...\n\n\"Hey there, Space Balls!\"\n\nIt is hard to explain, but it is as if while I was reminiscing him saying these words I also distinctly heard them in my head.  I looked up and there he stood, in the doorway of my bedroom, dressed just as he was when he walked out 10 years prior.  Wearing the same, but now torn, faded blue jeans and the same, but now tattered, Montgomery Varsity ball-cap. Older and graying, dirty, and hollow.  \"Back from the 7-11!\" he continued, \"turns out I  didn't want to start smoking any...\"\n\nMy shear disbelief was pierced by a shriek, or a shrill, or I'm not exactly sure how to describe the sound of abject horror Daphne exuded as she emerged from my bathroom wearing, nothing.  She quickly grabbed an Xbox controller from my desk and tried to use it to cover her, you know nether... parts.  Great, I thought to myself, if nothing else that should just about do it.\n\n\"You said we were alone!\"\n\n\"Dad!?! Wh- What are you?\" I exclaimed as I frantically gesticulated between she and him.\n\nBut then my eyes fixed on Daphne, doe-eyed and staring at me, holding a look of embarrassment, shock, and betrayal before she mustered, \"You said your father was dead, asshole.\" and turned to walk back into the bathroom.\n\nMy gaze returned to my dad, still frozen in the doorway, almost seeming as shocked as I by the turn of events.\n\n\"Z..., \" he began as he turned on the light, \"listen she's got to be like 15 years older than you.  Is she the babysitt...\"  but then he froze, mid sentence, as our eyes locked for the first time and what blood was left vanished from his already ashen face.\n\n\"Con-man?\"\n\n\"No dad, its me, Zach!\"\n\n\"Bud,\" he paused as tears welled up in his eyes, \"I missed you so...\"\n\n\"We missed you too Dad, where have you...\"\n\n\".... we thought you were... your mom and I were told you were dead.  They said you were dead...\" he continued as he rushed to the side on my bed. \"But you're alright. You've come back to us,\"  and as he cupped his hands around my neck I noticed a worn out plastic band around his wrist.\n\n\"yeah, Dad, yeah\" I replied through my tears, \"we're all back, now.\"\n",

Not this time though.\n\nReappering home was my dad.\n\nSomething was wrong. like if he was...\n\nConfused. for him not even 30 minutes had gone by \n\nRarely ever felt bad for dad since he dissapeared. He had abandoned us.\n\nOn the other hand, he might have been kidnapped.\n\nLike that would stop him. Dad was badass.\n\nLike, he would beat a thousand men in a fist to fist fight.\n\nSo... \" what happened? \" I asked him\n\nSometimes i thought he ran away with....\n\nKristen, his secret lover.\n\n\"You didnt do that did you?\" he didnt like that question\n\nRapidly he punches me in the jaw.\n\nIn seconds i'm on the ground.\n\nMy head spins as i wake up and hear a familiar voice.\n\n\"You were trying to cross the border right?\" \n\nI quickly read the first letters on each sentence.\n\nDamn you Todd Howard.\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Maybe I'm mad, maybe I'm not. But this motherfucker standing in front of me is my father, who disappeared ten years ago with some silly excuse of buying a pack of cigarettes, never to return. \n\nIn his absence, my mother had to struggle to make ends meet, while battling cancer and living with guilt, blaming herself  for his abrupt disappearance.\n\nSilence. Deadly silence. We stare at each other for what could have been an hour. Our mouths seemed to have lost the ability to formulate speech. In his eyes I could see a look of bewilderment. In my eyes I hope he could see the look of disgust, anger, hate,all boiling in a pot filled with rage. \n\n\"Charles?\"\n\nHis voice hasn't changed at all. \n\n\"Fffffffffaa...\" was all I could muster. \n\n\"Son.\"\n\n\"Father,\" I whispered. \"Why did you abandoned us?\" The volume of my voice sharply increased. \n\n\"I did not.\" He said, while staggering towards a chair. \n\nHe sat down and put his head in hands. \"Something's wrong.\" He said.\n\n\"Very.\" I replied through gritted teeth.\n\n\"Where's your mother?\"\n\n\"She died.\" I replied with malice. \"Two years ago on this exact date\". \n\n\"Its been two years?\" \n\n\"Ten. To be exact. Ten years since you left us.\"\n\n\"No no no no no.\" He kept shaking his head in his hands. \n\nHe stood up, looking like a ragged doll and shell-shocked. \"I've been gone an hour at most,\" He said.\n\nAt this moment a knock could be heard on the front door. I approached it , happy to be rid of my dad's psychotic presence, and opened the door. \n\nTwo men wearing identical black suits, and black sunglasses where standing on the front porch.\n\n\"Is this the home of the Luck family?\" The first man asked.\n\n\"Is there a problem?\" I replied.\n\n\"Is Mr. Edward Luck your father?\"\n\n\"Who's asking?\"\n\nThe men looked at each other and smirked.\n\n\"We're asking.\" The second man barked. \"Is he at home?\" \n\nI sniggered. \"This isn't his home anymore.\" \n\n\"Is he around?\" The first man queried.\n\n\"No. He. Isn't.\" I said firmly. \n\n\"Kid.\" The second man uttered. \"You don't wanna fuck with us.\" \n\n\"Now step aside\" the first man ordered, reaching in his pocket.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "The door handle started to turn. Sweat began dripping down my brow. \n\n\"No one has keys to my door, not even me.\" I screamed. \n\nThe door swung open. A large figure, stood blocking the sunlight behind it, like a large oak tree clamouring for the precious morning rays. \n\n\"SON\" A voice bellowed. \n\nI knew that voice, a voice so familiar it made me cry tears. \n\n\"SON I AM HOME\" \n\nNo it can't be, Dad? Father? It can't be, he left 10 years ago for cigarettes and never came back, ma just thought he slipped into the ice and starved to death. \n\n\"SON, IT'S ME. PAPA\" The man howled.\n\nI built up the courage to reply \"Be gone with you\"\n\nThe figure just stood there. I ran to the bathroom and grabbed Ma's favourite rifle. My hands were shaking like a leaf on the wind. \n\nI walked back into the hallway, aimed my rifle and fired. Hitting the figure in the neck, causing him to collapse. \n\nAs I approached the man an unpleasant realisation hit me like freight train that can't stop. He was in fact my beloved father. \n\n\"Papa no I'm sorry, I'm sorry. How are you here, you're supposed to be in the icy lake. I love you papa\" I fought through the tears. \n\nMy father tried to speak, but was struggling due to the blood building in his throat. \"Son, *blargagag* I ... love you... *blereghee* I'll never leave you again\" \n\nHis yellowed bloodshot eyes rolled back completely into into his head. He had died in agonising pain. \n\n\"WHY JESUS! WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME\" I cried out to the heavens. \n\nI hugged papa one last time, then began dragging him outside all whislt trying not to slip away on the copious amounts of blood on the floor. \n\nAfter an hour of dragging him, I reached a frozen lake. I dragged papa over and slid him into a hole in the ice. He sank down, vanishing back into the chilling abyss where he came from. \n\nMerry Christmas Papa\n\nBased on a true story",

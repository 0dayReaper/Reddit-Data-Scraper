            "comment": "I still remember when it happened quite clearly. \nWe were holding each other, we had just gotten to my place after playing basketball with our friends. There was a freshly baked pizza on the table but I didn't care about that, all I wanted was them. It was the afternoon and in the dying light your hazel eyes appeared a burning orange. We were laughing about something, I can't remember what anymore but it must have been funny, because then I looked at them and sincerely said\n\"I hope this moment lasts forever.\"\nAnd they smiled and agreed, and at the time we didn't know but that's when it started. Afterwards we ate the pizza and just fell asleep there on the couch, not bothering to go to bed. I woke up what must have been hours later and was immediately confused. The sun was right where it was before, just barely touching the edge of the horizon. I woke them up and we checked the time on my phone but it said 7:16 just like it had when we fell asleep. I assumed the phone was glitching so I checked my laptop but it said the same. I checked the window again, the sun still hadn't set and it must have been at least a few minutes since we woke up. I tried to call a friend but no one picked up. Then another, then another, then another. No one was answering, the time was still 7:16, the sun still hadn't set, and they were getting scared. When I had seen their eyes earlier they appeared like a burning flame, now they were more like dying embers. We decided to leave and try and get to a friend's place that was nearby, but the streets were empty. Cars sat in the road and all the houses were abandoned. We looked everywhere but soon we realized we were all alone. They were in a full blown panic by now and we stopped at the side of the road so they could sit down. \nI was terrified too but I wasn't going to let them know. \nThey were sobbing quietly and I gently helped wipe away their tears. \n\"Come on, we have to keep looking. There has to be some logical reason for this, we just need to find it\" I whispered\nThey calmed down enough to stand and we started walking again, but not before they mumbled\n\"I just wish this would end.\"\nFor hours we searched, every street, every store, even random peoples houses and cars. And yet there was nothing. When we got to our friends house no one was there. I knew where they had their spare key so we went in to look. It was like they had simply ceased to exist in the middle of a normal day. Their phone was on the ground with the headphones still attached, playing their Spotify playlist. A plate with a still warm grilled cheese was atop their table. A can of tomato soup was half opened on the kitchen counter. We searched but the effort was halfhearted, we both knew we would find nothing. We met back in the kitchen, their panic had calmed to a cold sadness, which was even worse. We stood there for a while, no clue what to do. Finally they spoke up\n\"We need to keep moving, like you said. We'll have to find something eventually.\"\nI nodded but didn't answer, then I looked at them.\n In the muted light of the house their eyes were the same color of dead leaves.\nThe first weeks were the worst. Endless searching for anything at all. At first we were almost hopeful but soon we were just going through the motions. We stole food and water from houses and stores when we got hungry, collected things like first aid kits and blankets, and would sleep after what we assumed was a day. Occasionally I would check phones and computers and clocks for the time but it never changed. It was always 7:16, no matter what. One day we woke up in yet another unfamiliar bed and neither got up. I remember laying and staring at the ceiling, lit up in the light of the endless sunset. After what was probably hours I looked at them and asked\n\"What are we going to do?\"\nThey were still and silent for a long moment before giving a small shake of their head, and saying\n\"I don't think it will ever end\"\nThen nothing more.\nWith their back to me, I was unable to see their eyes.\nThe months after  blurred together, we moved but with no real purpose anymore. We spent more time in each house we visited and would be less quick to leave. Talking was rare, and if it was happening it was mostly one sided. They stayed silent for days at a time, answering me with nods and shrugs and grunts. I stopped trying when I realized they weren't, and we slowly unraveled. The feeling of loneliness had already been crushing but with them slipping away it got worse. I craved human contact. I was always trying to slip my hand into theirs or hug them or give them the soft kisses we always used to have, but they pulled away. And I wanted to beg them for anything, a hug or a kiss or even just a smile that would show they weren't completely gone. But it was like my voice was gone, and every time I wanted to scream or cry or beg it died in my throat. Despite the neverending sunlight I was cold. But of course something as fragile as this could never stay, and one night it broke. We had been camping out in the same house for a few days and they were in the living room laying on the sofa. I had just come back from scavenging for food and when I came through the door I saw them. I felt a rush if deja Vu so intense I stumbled back. They looked just as they had before it had all started, the sun from a window behind them made them almost appear to glow. They had started staring at me with a worried expression and I realized I must have looked terrible. Then to my shock they spoke for the first time in weeks\n\"Are, are you ok?\"\nI opened my mouth to reassure them, to make a joke, to say anything at all but instead a horrible sob came out and I started weeping. Before I knew it they were beside me and were gently guiding me to the couch and had me sit down. I wanted so badly to talk but I just couldn't. I tried but then they softly wiped me tears and said\n\"You don't have to say anything, you can just cry right now.\"\nI broke down completely, falling into their arms and for the first time in months feeling warm. When I had finally finished I was able to talk again, and I did. For hours we spoke of anything and everything. It was amazing just to have conversation again after so long of isolation. It didn't matter to me that most of it was meaningless, I still felt human again. Eventually we stopped and took some time to breathe, then came the harder part of the conversation.\n\"You can't do that again\"\n\"Do what?\"\n\"Slip away, refuse to talk, give up. Because this is never going to end, and I need you.\"\nThey're silent for a moment before hugging me as tightly as possible.\n\"Never again, I swear that to you. I will never leave you again\"\nThe brightness that fills their eyes reminds me of a spark lighting a flame.",

                    "comment": "We decided to stay in the house, not just because we're exhausted but because we're now sure that we're not going to find anything out there. I don't mind, the house is nice. It's near a forest and a lake, it's close to a bunch of stores so we're not going to run out of food anytime soon, and it's nice and big. Not a bad place to start a new life. And slowly we build up a sort of new normal. It's not easy, talking is still hard for a while, and there were quite a few times where they break down and start to drift away. But it never lasts, and soon we find each other again. We collect things from stores and houses to keep, something that we couldn't do while moving around so much. after a while we begin to make the house feel more like our home. We found paints in nearby stores and make it a challenge to see who can make their side look better. It had been so long since either of us had fun so it was a bit strange but soon we got used to it. And while in the middle of splattering paint on the walls and joking about who was doing better (It was them) they laughed for the first time since the incident . It was small and short but it made me cry from happiness. Slowly those moments became more and more common in our strange world. And while occasionally I would feel a deep sadness from losing so many friends and they would clam up after something bad happened life became better and better. I don't know how long it's been since the incident happened but it must have at least been a few years by now, I guess it doesn't really matter. We just got back home, it's late afternoon(as always) there's a freshly baked pizza on the table but I don't really care about that. because despite everything around me, the perpetually never setting sun and the clocks that forever say 7:16 and the almost completely empty world where theri once was billions of people the only thing that matters is right in front of me on the couch. Bathed in the afternoon light their eyes remind me of the warm glow of a fireplace, and they quietly whisper\n\"I hope this moment lasts forever\"\n\"Me too\"\n\n\n\nHope that was ok lol, I just sort of wrote this on a whim so it's kind of rushed.",

            "comment": "\"Of course, sir. We can do this wherever you like, everything will be arranged for you afterwards. Discreetly, of course.\"\n\nI can't keep my eyes off his neck. Or rather, a series of heavy, bulbous chins where his neck once used to be. I honestly had no clue human beings could get this fat. How would this guy fare in the wilderness, I wonder. Briefly, an image flashes through my mind of this big (and I do mean big) fancy CEO dressed in a leopard print loincloth attempting to swing from a vine and falling flat on his face. \n\n\"Something funny, Miss?\"\n\nThe mass of chins doesn't even move when he speaks. \"No sir, of course not,\" I lie while I quickly gather my composure and showcase a more serious expression, \"I promise you I'm taking this very seriously. It's an important moment for you and I aim to adapt to your needs as well as I possibly can.\" The man gives a quick nod and I have to hold back laughter when the flock of chins seem to all jiggle one by one in response. \"Good. Let's talk then.\"\n\nCaught off guard by his sudden turn and his quick stride, I almost stumble while I try to follow behind him through the overly luxurious lobby, bumping into somebody and uttering a quick \"Excuse me\" as I fight my way through the crowd of people. *You have a colossal fucking room to walk around in, why are you all smushed together?*\n\nEventually me and Mister Chins manage to arrive at the heavy-duty elevator that I assume is going to take us up to a more quiet room. Most of our clients prefer discussing this in private, which is one of those odd little similarities between my old job and this one. I wonder if there's going to be any talking on the elevator. God, I hope there's no talking on the elevator.\n\n*Ding*.\n\nShortly after we step inside, the murmur of the crowd is silenced by the elevator doors and I am left standing there alone with Chin-ichanga. The peace and quiet is short-lived however, as I see the man's shoulders raise for a massive breath, which will undoubtedly be followed by words. Damn it. \"So I understand you used to be a doctor?\" He manages to say in between his heavy breathing. I almost feel bad for him. I can imagine a man in his early 70s the size of a baby elephant has trouble getting around, but any feelings of compassion are quickly shaken off when I remind myself that he chose this. He and all those other \"gourmands\" that no longer had any reason to stop stuffing their face now that heart attacks were nothing more than a few jabs of chest pains and a couple of minutes of unconsciousness.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I answer politely, \"I started my own practice just a month before the Hippocratic Oath pretty much became null and void.\" Count Chincula chortled and replied \"Tough luck there, hun.\" I cringe. Maybe I'll actually enjoy treating this one. \"Yes, sir... And... Excuse me for asking, but it's my obligation... You've made all the necessary arrangements? Contacted family, canceled any ongoing-\" \"Yes, yes, of course I have\" he barked back, chins blubbering wildly. I give a respectful nod and clench my fist around my briefcase. \n\nThe rest of the ride was awkwardly quiet, just the way I liked it. Only the second ding of the elevator and the opening of the doors could be heard, followed by two echoing pairs of footsteps and eventually a door being opened. His private office was surprisingly nice. Warm colors, comfortable furniture, a fantastic view of the city, completely soundproofed. I could see why one would want to do this here, especially having lived their life based around what happened in this room.\n\n\"It's... going to work, right?\"\n\nI turn my head when I hear his voice. His breathing is labored, raspy, exhausted, and his voice surprisingly vulnerable.\n\n\"... Yes, sir. I promise.\"\n\nSeeming somewhat comforted by my promise, the Chinpanzee gives a nod and lowers himself onto the most comfy and heavy couch I've seen in my life with the most gut-wrenching pained groan. There's that damn empathy again, ruining my fun.\n\n\"Good. Good... Painless?\"\n\n\"Just a small sting, sir.\"\n\n\"Good...\" I watch as the man stares blankly out of his office window, a sight he must've taken in countless times before. I decide to give him some time for the usual self-reflecting bullshit these people must be up to in these final moments. Until his voice sounds again, even more vulnerable than before, truly the voice of an old, weathered man past his time.\n\n\"Miss... Can you tell me how it works?\"\n\nI face him and look him in the eyes for a few silent seconds before I walk closer and sit beside him.\n\n\"It's... not quite like death, of course. Not that anyone knew what that was like.\" I begin to explain as I place the briefcase on my lap and open it up. I see the realization set in in his expression. \"It's just a sleep, sir. Stand-by mode for the brain.\"\n\nI pull the syringe and the small bottle out of the foam in my briefcase. He watches me unscrew the cap and poke the needle into the bottle. He seems ready for it, which makes me feel a bit better as well.\n\n\"Never been a big fan of needles...\" he admits to me as he rolls up his sleeve, and a comforting smile curls onto my lips while I attempt to find a vein in his, frankly, fat arm.\n\n\"I'll make it as painless as possible, sir... Just keep your chin up.\"",

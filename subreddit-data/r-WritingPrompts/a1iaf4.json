            "comment": "What does an alien dream of? When it has a good dream; does it smile, with its ten mouths, or its sharp beak? When it turns in bed, does it use arms, or a tail? Does it ooze to the side, letting the brown goo cool while the green goo rests on the pillow? When it shivers, do chills run down a spine, or through a system of tentacles? \n\nTo these questions, there are an infinite number of answers. But for one question, there is a single answer\u2014When it\u2019s afraid; what does it fear? \n\nIt fears the hunter.\n\nThe hunter is a bipedal, clumsy creature. It\u2019s not particularly strong; it can lift a stone of around fifty kilograms. It\u2019s not particularly bright, for a sentient species, although it is highly intuitive and emotional. It cannot see in the dark, it cannot hold its breath for longer than 300 seconds, and it cannot hear sound past one-hundred-thousand hertz. \n\nThe hunter has one advantage over all other forms of life, a unique trait\u2014persistence. Imagine seeing the eyes of the hunter in the nearby forest. You flee, much faster than the gangly beast. You stop to rest, only to have it appear *again* in the forest. It stares at you with cold, calculating eyes, smiling as you flee in terror. The hunter will follow you, unrelenting, until you collapse from exhaustion; only then will it kill you.  \n\nThe hunter is capable of self-regeneration when injured. Like other sentient life, it has developed the ability to extract natural resources from any environment it is placed in. It has developed complex working societies, like the other races. The hunter is not so different from you or I, except the hunter has developed the most gruesome method of killing\u2014persistence breeding.\n\nThe method is as simple as it is terrifying\u2014breed until there is no other form of sentient life in the universe.  Like a leech, they consumed the most valuable resource in the universe; souls. Every newborn hunter requires a soul. Souls cannot be created or destroyed, merely transferred from one form to another, so when a hunter is born, another soul is taken. \n\nBefore the hunters, every new soul drew from the well of souls. This well, an abstract dimension, is full of billions of tangible souls\u2014the great storage chest of life in the universe. For millennia, this well remained balanced. Each soul taken from the well was replaced in kind. The depth of the well ebbed and flowed with the rise and fall of civilizations; years of war increased the well, years of prosperity reduced it, but all was balanced in time. Then came the hunters, and in a span of five hundred years the well was completely dry. \n\nFirst, we tried eradicating the hunters with disease; but they developed immunity. Then we influenced them to destroy one another\u2014twice\u2014to no avail. We encouraged them to irradiate one another, but their conscience grew; they stayed their hand. We sought to destroy the very world they live on, but now they move towards the stars; persistence incarnate. \n\nWe lie awake at night, staring at the ceiling, or the stars, or the hive. When we sleep, our dreams are wrought with fear. At any given moment we could wink out of existence, slain by the perfect hunter\u2014the reaper of souls. Like the hunting method of old, they will come for us. We can run to the very edge of the galaxy, but they will find us. Slowly, unfaltering, they will continue to breed and endure, until there is nothing left in our universe but their race. \n\nThe hunters\u2014or so we call them\u2014The Great Filter. \n***\nr/BLT_WITH_RANCH",

            "comment": "In a way, the galaxy was becoming smarter.\n\nSentience isn't that hard to come across, though mostly found in those primal beings that claw and kill and eat with no regard to the suffering it causes.  \n\nThat is the law of nature.  Consume or die.  Adapt or die.  Basically either be the best, or die.  Death tends to be nature's preferred method of selection.\n\nOn the third rock around a rather average yellow star, orbited a planet populated by naked apes.  They killed, they loved, they laughed, they plotted, the helped, they prayed, they raged, they envied, they shared and they lived.  When they decided intelligence and stamina could let them dominate they planet, their species grew and consumed and destroyed and slaughtered and flourished.  \n\nSuch was the will of the nude monkey.  Two legs, two arms, one big hunk of meat between their ears that told them interesting things and lent impressive deductive skills.\n\nMost of the time it could be trusted.\n\nSome of the time it couldn't.\n\nInitial observations of the planet yielded quick answers.  Hundreds of sentient species, with a few that you could argue were sapient. \n\nAn important distinction, but here was a planet capable of sapping most of the galactic population limit.  Some of these animals were no threat to the overall limit; there could only be so many dogs and cats and elephants and monkeys.\n\nHumans, were quite the different story.\n\nIf they weren't able to kill themselves, they'd spread throughout their arm of the Milky Way in a few hundred years.  Sure, they'd probably cap off at twelve billion on Earth alone.  \n\nBut what about on their space stations?\n\nOn their colonies?\n\nOn other terra-formed worlds?\n\nThe council's decision was quite unanimous, though one or two protested out of caution.  Why not let them die out on their own planet?\n\nWhy not let them destroy their own world, removing billions from the collective galactic consciousness?\n\nOverruled by more impetuous minds, a few ships were sent to glass the planet, sterilizing the Sol system and preventing humanity from growing past their little blue world.\n\nExcept something went wrong in orbit.\n\nSomething didn't go according to plan.\n\nNo one would be able to pinpoint the exact moment they knew things had gone wrong, but in the decades of failed launches and space expeditions, the low orbit of Earth was a minefield of debris that the humans were in the process of cleaning up.\n\nNearly a dozen ships shocked into low orbit, only to be rendered full of holes and partially damaged.\n\nMost fell to earth.\n\nSome were captured by orbital satellites.\n\nInstead of destroying the Earth, the council had lent it the collected knowledge of the advanced species of the Milky Way.\n\nWhat would take a hundred years to discover, humans adapted in one.  Scientific advancements so advanced that most of them considered basically magic were reverse-engineered faster than anyone could imagine.  Humans seemed to enjoy pattern recognition, and to enhance galactic cohesion most systems were designed to be easily replicated and understood across species.\n\nPerhaps this shows the arrogance that comes with age, that an ancient civilization should always crush the younger.  That after conquering a hundred species, there comes a sense of apathy towards the destruction of belligerent life forms.  Yet another ant to crush between your finger and thumb.\n\nAll it takes is one mistake, one underestimation of your opponent.  Nature cares little for second chances.\n\nTrillions of drones would depart from the Sol system, scouting distant star systems and charting habitable worlds.\n\nThe most dangerous species in the universe had been handed the greatest weapons of war available, and despite the galactic ban on artificial intelligence, the humans synchronized with their machines.\n\nSoon they would pour across the Milky Way, consuming all in their path.\n\nAll the council races could do was pray, and fight for as long as they could.\n\nHumans didn't play fair, and had little mercy to offer these races.  Old traditions of honor and pride didn't translate to the humans.  Outwardly they would claim these qualities, but in practice there was only pragmatic brutality.  Orbital bombardments, drone fleets, biological weapons, and the rarest and most devastating of forces, actual human deployment planet side.\n\nMessages were clear, so clear that no species needed a translator.  Submit or die.\n\nRegardless of the alien's choice, most of the time the humans came to their own decisions about the fate of the galaxy.\n\nThey decided they liked being the apex species of the Milky Way.\n\nTrue, there were plenty of worlds to share.  Plenty of stars to capture, plenty of systems to mine and crack open, spilling out more materials than any one species could possibly hope to use.\n\nExcept humans weren't prone to sharing.  If there was one thing they hated more than themselves, it was the smattering of intelligent life that once sought their destruction.\n\nMost species would beg for mercy.  Ask to serve, anything to avoid the extinction fleets of autonomous drones that would wipe an entire system of organic life in a few weeks time.\n\nSometimes the humans listened.\n\nThe majority of the time, they didn't.\n\nPerhaps if the galactic council had sought to control the amount of sapient life forms, the humans would have left them in peace.  Instead of seeking to sterilize the Earth, seeking a peaceful coexistence.\n\nMaybe things would have ended differently.\n\nBut human memories are long and complex.  Their grudges thousands of years old, built on a million and one arbitrary differences that confounded and terrified the humans.  Nothing motivates a human more than hate or fear or love.\n\nIn targeting them all, the arbitrary differences seemed to melt away.\n\nReplaced by a deeper, darker yearning.\n\nA better Milky Way.\n\nA pure galaxy.\n\nA strong galaxy.\n\nA prosperous galaxy.\n\nA human galaxy.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nr/storiesfromapotato",

Just because our suffering has no one single cause doesn't mean that it's folly to try and alleviate it wherever possible. The message is fundamentally anti-progress.\n\nWould those things we tried solve all suffering? No. But they'd still make things better. And that's ignoring the fact that with sufficiently advanced technology, we may someday be able to modify ourselves so that we no longer DO need to suffer. Not being happy all the time may be a fundamental part of human nature, but with advanced technology and self-modification, we can change what it means to be human.\n\nInstead, the video just seems to suggest giving up. Just... resign yourself to things being bad and give up on trying to make them any better.",

We live lives dozens of times less dangerous and with technologies hundreds of times better than that of our ancestors, yet we have adapted our views to see this as the norm. \n\nMy point is that nearly no matter what we end up accomplishing, we will focus on another negative aspect of our lives. Take the fan bases of popular games such as CS:GO or Dota: they obsess over the most minute details for the very fact that everything else has already been solved. I believe this was the main idea of the story; humans will never be contempt with that they have, inevitably seeking out different methods of \u201cfixing their lives\u201d.\n\nI do agree that we could change what it means to be human, potentially eliminating the need for sadness, boredom, or just a general sense of normalisation but that\u2019s beside the point. It would be great if we could do that but that is no longer a discussion of how content humans can be, rather how much we would be willing to change our bodies. It\u2019s ok that this specific video doesn\u2019t cover this topic because I believe this is the theme of many other Exurb1a videos.\n\nBasically I don\u2019t think the point of the video is that we should \u201cgive up and resign yourself to things being bad\u201d, rather that we should be content with ourselves when we can\u2019t continue to improve our lives.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t go to war with our fellow humans to improve our lives by a minuscule amount. We shouldn\u2019t destroy our livelihoods for the goal of improving them. To paraphrase this that and the other, Exurb1a doesn\u2019t want us to \u201cbecome the very thing we swore to destroy\u201d.",

Basically a scout team of aliens go to an empty earth that had obviously developed since the last \"galactic intelligence sweep\" and the Sun is about to go nova and consume thebsolar system.\n\nSo these aliens are quickly checking the planet and the separate species comment on how quickly this species (humans) had developed the big landmark technologies like radio and tv and flight based on the abandoned technologies. Then they find a huge comm array on top of a leveled Everest and follow the signal to find a huge matrix of rockets in deepnspace heading towards the next nearest habitable system.\n\nIt ends to the effect of them about to make contact and one alien says, \"let's just hope a species tenacious and dogged enough to attempt interstellar travel with *rockets* is nice. And they all laugh. Then there's a page break.\n\n\"A decade later, no one would think it was funny.\"\n\nEdit: It's \"Rescue Party\" by  Arthur C Clarke",

Confusion spread, then alarm. For the first time in [4 billion years], we conducted a census. \n\n92.5 billion. From 100 billion, our population for as long as we remember.\n\nSome kind of new plague? The bravest of us went off to look at the remains of our sisters. They came back with nothing. Just dead beings floating in the cosmos. \n\nIs the universe shrinking? Maybe that\u2019s the cause of our lower population. Nothing indicated that our universe was dying however, and this hypothesis was shelved. \n\nWith every moment that passed, our population shrank, and it shrank exponentially. Some began to resign, and accept death as it came. Until we found it. \n\nA planet around a star. Insignificant, but for those who live on it. Tiny meaty creatures, with two legs. The rate of their population growth and the rate of our decline were identical. We did the math. 100 Billion, our combined population. For every two-legged creature born, one of us dies. \n\nOutrage spread. Why are our lives equivalent? Why should one insignificant speck with a miniscule capacity for thought be equal with us, who span whole systems, who can solve the riddles of the universe with ease? \n\nOne species for the survival of another. The only logical solution.\n\nIt seemed easy enough at the time. We sent a few meteorites their way, enough to render the planet uninhabitable for their fragile little bodies. It would take a while, yes. But in due time, these two-legged creatures would plague them no more. \n\nThe first asteroid hit, and then another. Rolling waves of fire and ash covered the surface. We turned away and began to slowly rebuild our population. \n\nExcept we couldn\u2019t. We conducted another census. The second in just [2000] years! Unbelievable! 99 billion, it said. We kept conducting regular censuses, every [100 years] or so. The data didn\u2019t lie. We were shrinking again. \n\nAnother call was made for a return to Earth. When we got there, the planet was still in ruins. It wasn\u2019t the two-legged folk. Or we thought. At the very limits of my sense, I detected a small metal ship, filled with those same creatures we thought were extinct. \n\nWe looked closer. \n\nMillions of small ships and tiny habitable pods were seeded across their system, as well as the systems surrounding it. Thousands of tiny cities were attached to asteroids and moons and planets. \n\nIt was panic this time. \n\nHow could we eradicate them now? In every nook and cranny of a star system lay a human settlement. We continue to send asteroids and comets to any planet or moon of sufficient size. \n\nIt was no good. We kept dying. \n\nIn time, the asteroids were stopped. They were blown up, redirected, or the target just moved out of the way. \n\nAgony. Something had destroyed one of my limbs. They were here.\n\nThey spoke. One species for the survival of another. \n\nI resigned myself to my fate. \n\n___\nIf you have any criticisms, please let me know! I'm always trying to improve. \n\nSome criticisms of myself are that I failed to capture a real alien feel, that the voice of my narrator is a bit inconsistent, and that I had an issue with the scale of time for the species of the narrator and humanity. I changed my mind on the ending too many times, and it's not really that great. At one point I wanted humanity to be glassed, and then I wanted an ending where they came to a peaceful solution, and then a violent ending with humanity losing, and so on. At least I finished a story, haha.",

                    "comment": "I think considering the length of your work that you did quite well. My 'criticism' would be that the alien narrator sounded very human, in the sense that it lacked the wisdom I would have imagined a species that had been evolving for much longer would have had. On one hand, the narration was driven emotionally, allowing us as people to sympathize with an extraterrestrial race (because people are emotionally-driven), but on the other I feel like an ET-race that evolved via natural selection for so much longer than us would have bred empathy out of itself to survive. It's a very ambiguous concept to write about because it becomes balancing a 'realistic' depiction of a species, that in all likelihood developed based on incredibly different factors than humanity, and catering to the emotional appeal of your audience by allowing it to be more 'human'.\n\nI think that the way you approached the topic from the 'humanistic' perspective was solid and consistent. The ending was a good tie-in, which is always a solid clinch for flash fiction. In the end, and this is just advice from a casual writer (I've always had a knack, but nowhere near as creative as you), sometimes settling for something that isn't 100% your vision is necessary. Don't get too caught up on the little details, especially if you have desire to get published. As long as you produced something that based on your standards is 'adequate' in conveying your message (and I use that word because all artists are absolute perfectionists), the way the story ends is not so important. Producing fiction is an organic process, it's not a speech with a bullet-pointed outline - so don't get too neurotic lol. The important point is that it is cogent, enjoyable to read, and enjoyable to write.\n\nSo yeah, that said, I really enjoyed your work.",

It had taken the last 16 years of his life for him and his team to work out a communication system with the outerlings that was abstract enough to share concepts other than basic mathematics. He had assumed that his translations were once again mistaken, but they had repeated their message in so many different ways that his team couldn't be mistaken on all of them. \n\nA galactic limit on the number of sentient creatures. Moreover a galactic limit that was so small that the number of humans on earth was disrupting it. A galaxy with 300 billion star systems somehow could only have 50 billion sentient entities, and of those 16% now resided within orbit of a single planet's satellite. \n\nThe outerlings hadn't come to negotiate. They had merely come to explain, apologize, and describe how they would effect the population control measures they would implement. A device would be placed in orbit of mercury which would project a field which would doppler shift solar radiation directed towards earth further into the infrared end of the spectrum greatly reducing the ability of plants to gather energy. This would greatly reduce the maximum population the Earth could support. \n\nThey estimated that human society would take centuries to neutralize the effects of the device which could protect itself by modulating its effect to shower any approaching craft with focused solar radiation. They thought that humanity would behave as natural for any threatened organism. Draw away from the pain, preserve resources, weather the storm. Make sacrifices.\n\nMaybe we would. \n\nNathan's team had managed the translations, but they weren't responsible for the decisions, and with the outerlings cutting off contact his team was being dissolved. Each specialist heading back to their own fields of study. They weren't going away empty handed however. During the work to establish communication the outerlings had begun with repetitions of certain universal constants, and formula for converting between them. \n\nMany of them had matched with the values we had already worked out on our own. Some had been very close, differing by inconsequential values of accuracy. Others... well they weren't anything we had ever considered, but they had made quite a splash among the theoretically minded. Some interesting things might be happening in the applied sciences in the coming decades.\n\nHis particular skills wouldn't be needed for that battle, but he figured he could do his part for his species in other ways. \"Hey, would you like to help save humanity?\", might be a bit much for a pickup line, but he though he knew someone who appreciate it. After all increasing the population sevenfold might be taxing, but it was a damn sight better than having it go the other way.",

            "comment": "Across the galaxy, top scientists, political leaders, and philosophers were called to an urgent meeting. \u201cWith a heavy heart, yet fresh hope, I am pleased to announce our scouts have finally discovered the source of our recent unexplained population decline. An out of the way planet of newly sentient life has recently made great advances in medicine, leading to increased life span and population boom. Their advancements would be celebrated and observed with interest in the hope of peaceful relations were there room for so many in the galaxy, but their success is the doom of our families, our friends, and ultimately, our very lives. As our most brilliant and well respected minds, you have all been summoned to discuss a plan of action for dealing with this threat. Collaboration is encouraged, and no idea is too extreme in these dire times.\u201d\n\nThe debate raged on for hours. The politicians discussed making contact, establishing peaceful relations, seeing if humans could be persuaded to join the rest of the galaxy in strictly mandated population control. The idea of outright war was floated by some of the bolder (or more fearful) council members. Scientists considered covert chemical sterilization, or causing the humans to turn on themselves to reduce population drastically. They considered introducing poisons into the food supply, and one of them even began developing a concrete plan to piggyback a dangerous \u201cdisease\u201d on the most widely consumed vegetable, Romaine lettuce. Ideas and desperation began to pile up.  \n\u201cOur people are DYING,\u201d screamed one politician, tilting across the table like an old live oak struck by lightning. \u201cAnd none of you are willing to take the hard steps necessary to ensure our survival!\u201d \n\u201cWe are all willing to take any steps we deem necessary. But we must reach consensus before action,\u201d cautioned an older scientist. \nAfter what seemed like many standard cycles, as people began to despair and ruin their voices from shouting, one of the youngest philosophers, silent until now, began to speak. \n\u201cIt seems to me that there is a great advantage for us in human society that is being overlooked,\u201d they said cautiously, adjusting their notes and glasses. Weary heads turned, listless. \u201cLike us, many humans are able to find sexual and romantic satisfaction in same sex pair bonds. Some of them are unable to find satisfaction OUTSIDE of these bonds.\u201d \n\u201cAnd?\u201d The president asked wearily. \n\u201cThe main problem, according to my research, is that for some reason humans have been suppressing this natural bonding process for millennia. The reason projected growth for life in the galaxy is off (again, according to my own studies) is that nearly every region on the planet has some sort of legal or societal taboo on this, and as a result of people pretending this is unnatural and attempting to be \u201cnatural,\u201d the population has grown more than it ever should have. Not only is it threatening life in the galaxy, it is also threatening the ecosystem of their own planet.\u201d Several council members began to sit up straighter, a glint of hope in their eyes. \n\u201cDo you mean to tell me the solution\u2019s been this simple the whole time?\u201d\n\u201cI think so ma\u2019am, yes. What we need is -\u201c\n\u201cA gay agenda!\u201d\nThe entire room burst from end to end with applause and cheers as every brilliant mind turned to the issue of solving earth\u2019s crisis of population, using the most powerful force known to the universe: the pure balancing effect of radiant and radical gay love. \n\n\n(Yes I know this is silly beyond belief and I have no clue what\u2019s going on with the dialogue and pacing.

            "comment": "Fermi\u2019s paradox, it baffles the mind. There is so much to the universe, but not much intelligent life. Humans thought it was because either there was no other intelligent life, or that some great filter existed that kept intelligent life from evolving. The latter is a bit closer to the truth, but not in the way they thought.\n\nSentience is something hard to understand. Most intelligent species don\u2019t know where it comes from. The few that do, don\u2019t fully understand. The truth is, sentience is part of the universe itself. Kind of like a shared experience between life and the universe. One upside to this is that intelligent life is bound to form anywhere that can support complex living beings. The downside is that there\u2019s only so much to go around.\n\nIt\u2019s not like the other forces in nature. There\u2019s no limit to how much gravity or electro-magnetism can exist, it just does. Sentience is directly linked to the energy in the universe. As energy can neither be created nor destroyed, sentience can\u2019t surpass a percentage of the energy in a given universe. The first species to discover this was in a previous universe, unfortunately close to that universes heat death.\n\nIn our universe, it was discovered fairly early on. A galactic council was set up between all known species to allocate population control. There were strict laws in place for reproducing across the universe. Applications had to be approved by a sub sect of the galactic council on every planet. Each planet was given a number not to pass yearly based on the number of deceased beings the year prior. It was very closely maintained.\n\nRecently there has been a large uptick in the number of deceased beings and, more alarmingly, a larger number of births born lifeless. Somehow the universal limit had been reached. The council members were perplexed, they had always left at least 5 billion total left over just in case. There was no way their math was off by that much, that left only 1 possibility. Somewhere in the universe was undiscovered sentient life.\n\nThe council immediately sent notice to all discovery crews to scour their sector again. Somehow there was life out there that reproduced so fast that it was disrupting the natural order. The crews were dispatched and the search began. Back at the council chambers, representatives of every species gathered and waited for news. \n\nA search for sentient life was conducted every quarter rotation of an average Galaxy, so labeled 1 galactic standard rotation. That was, on average, every 62.5 million years per search. It hadn't been that long since the last one though, not even 1/8th of a rotation. Every planet with life showed only the basest forms, nothing capable of actual sentience.\n\nHumanity has existed on earth in its current form for 200,000 years. Nowhere in the universe is there another species that reproduces at the rate humans do. The average lifespan of a human is approximately 73 Earth years. Compared to the average lifespan of all other species though that\u2019s nothing. The average lifespan of most others is 1,500 Earth years, give or take a bit. It was inconceivable to the rest of the galactic community that such a species could exist. That is exactly why humanity slipped under the radar, figuratively and literally.\n\nAt the end of the search, 3 different planets supporting undiscovered sentient life were uncovered. One had a small population doomed for extinction due to planetary effects. One was small and advancing quickly, peaceful contact was made with them and they were introduced to the galactic community. There were only 263,000 between those two planets, 95% of those being on the latter. The last planet discovered sent shockwaves through the universe.\n\nEarth, as the native inhabitants called it, had a stunning 5.1 billion sentient beings when discovered. That was only one species, there were others on the cusp of sentience as well. Nothing like this had ever been seen before. These Humans reproduced at an astonishing rate, everything on that planet did. Once found, the Council ordered surveillance on the planet to get an accurate reading on life there. After 30 Earth years the survey was completed. In that short time, they watched as the population of sentient beings grew from approximately 5.1 Billion to 7.7 Billion. The council was sent word immediately.\n\nPanic set in as Earths population grew out of control. The Council gathered to discuss options. The following record is as close to Human English as there could be. \u201cThey reproduce to quickly, the only option is to neutralize the planet.\u201d Council Member Gra\u2019zaad said. \u201cWe have looked at their history as well. Not only do they reproduce faster than any known species, they are highly aggressive even amongst one another.\u201d Council Member Breght Tan Knlowgler said. A round of \u201cHere, here\u201d broke out amongst the members. \u201cI believe there is another way,\u201d Council Member Tom said. Everyone quieted down. \u201cWhy waste an entire species, They are on the very edge of sentience as it is it seems. We must deploy the (no translation exists). It is the only way to ensure the safety of the entire Galactic Community\u201d \u201cThat has been banned by Council Law and you know it.\u201d Council Member Leplendersticht said. \u201cDesperate times.\u201d Council Member Tom replied.\n\nAnd so, a fleet of ships was sent to Earth with the solution on board. Once in orbit, the (no translation exists) was powered up and aimed at Earth. Once unleashed it would revert the Humans to non-sentient beings, effectively rendering them nothing but lowly beasts once again. It would strip the intelligence from any being close to sentience as well, ensuring none on the planet could come that close again. As Council Member Tom said, why waste an entire species. There were lots of mouths to feed in the universe.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nMore from me at [R/WorksofIndridFrost1](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorksofIndridFrost1/)",

Birds were chirping kids were playing in the streets, there wasn't a cloud in sight. \n\nThere was one thing which rather spoiled this picturesque day. A massive spherical shape blocked out the sun for most of the central United States. Scientists didn't know what to make of it, the military wanted to nuke it, and several of the world's major religions decided that it was a sign from God. Most agreed that this was a sign of the apocalypse.\n\nFor the first time in history, they were absolutely right. \n\n\"People of Earth, may we have your attention please.\", a droning voice said, \"This is Bellagor, Prime Prefect of this Sector. I am here to inform you that you are all in violation of several intergalactic treaties regarding population growth.\" His voice was being broadcast through every working system with a speaker, this did nothing but exacerbate his terribly grating voice. \n\n\"I am here in order to deliver two options. First, we can set limits on reproduction, only allowing one half of breeding pairs to have children this generation....\", an uproar broke out from just about everywhere on Earth. The Prefect barely needed a recording device to hear their response. Even from low orbit. \n\nThe Prefect sounded agitated, \"Okay, okay. We can take the second option. Please yourselves. Prepare to glass  the entire planet.\", through the speakers, Earthicans everywhere could hear him walking away and muttering, \"The ungrateful little sloggars, not my fault they breed like rodents.\" \n\nPeople everywhere decided that this was the time. This was the perfect opportunity. They would finally get those televisions and digital watches they had always very much wanted, but could never afford. Some of them even had the chance to turn them on before the glassing began. They spent their final half hour on Earth watching that last episode of Stranger Things on Netflix, or if they weren't lucky, driving home so they could make use of their new flatscreen.\n\n*****************\n/r/SirLemoncakes\n\n",

The council is 12 representatives among the long lived species, the ancient ones, as they are popularly called. They command the most powerful fleets, technology indistinguishable to magic, and an arrogance that makes Ja'lor's scales shiver in both fear and disgust. However the news Ja'lor holds is an unprecedented occurrence, a system of 20 Billion sentients, 6 billion on a single world alone. Well beyond the 3-5 billion allowed for an emerging species.\n\nHe reached the massive and ornate doors of the council chambers and ushered in as if expected, one of the ancient ones attributes that surprised him the first day as a Council Servitor 15 years ago, and which unnerves him even today.\n\n\"Servitor Ja'lor, what news do you bring in such a hurry?\" 1st One Malde'v asked in his usual elegant tone, Ja'lor bows respectfully as he answers, \"An anomaly 1st One.

Ja'lor was confused, he looked up and saw relief on the 1st One's face?! \"I see, finally The Cause is found.\" In disbelief Ja'lor forgot himself, \"1st One? Cause of what?\" The 1st One ignored his breach of protocol and instead answered, \"The Cause of the great extinctions of the past centuries Ja'lor. There's a limit to how many sentients exist in this galaxy, when one is born one must die.\" \n\n\"Your decree 1st One?\" Ja'lor asked still not understanding him. \"This is a universal truth Servitor.\" 3rd One Grasitas stated as fact, \"You see Ja'lor we recently discovered a truth, sentient life is connected in ways even we knew not.\" 1st One added. \"Death and life is cyclic and our souls emerge and return into a finite well of 8th dimensional space.\"\n\n\"So the decree is a public symbol of this universal truth?!\" Ja'lor was dumbfounded. \"Indeed Ja'lor. Few would accept this willingly, fewer still will without violence, so we played villainous and wrote such an unreasonable decree.\"\n\n\"However the problem still remains Malde'v, what to do with this species, do we cast aside our ethic again?\" 7th One Hyllia spoke in a sharp tone unbecoming her renowned beauty. \"Hyllia, your feelings does not change reality. One born means one's death. Not one in this council pretends the universe is fair.\" 1st One retorts in an exasperated tone, clearly an argument these ancient one's have had before, 'I guess these ancient ones do have a heart' Ja'lor thought in the privacy of his own mind. 1st One then looked at him squarely, bringing Ja'lors hearts to his throat, \"Ja'lor go and bring representatives of this species, and tells us of them now so we may prepare.\"\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJa'lor told them of the emerging species who call themselves Human and of their system called Sol. The council listened silent and patiently as he presented the summery of their history, their art, and nature. A species of contradictions, of great violence, of great achievement, and once done Ja'lor took the 109th Fleet to make contact. Now Ja'lor sits in a cell deep within a moon called Io, looking at a Human male in the eyes. Ja'lor can see the human thinking, calculating, as he has seen within the eyes of the 1st One. The survey was way out of date, the Humans had grown into a local super power, and the Fleet lay waste in a dozen systems in what the Humans call The Orion Arm. Not a single system, but a Federation of systems and species bore down on the fleet, once Ja'lor informed the Humans of the council's decree they reacted like the rebellious ones. However they won their rebellion, they cause so much extinction, ironically, because they emerged into the galaxy as nation builders, protecting life from tyrants. Ignorant of a truth that even Ja'lor finds hard to believe. Such a contradicting species these Humans are! The Human exhaled then half chuckled, \"So that's the story. This council believes such a thing?\" he asked, Ja'lor nodded, \"They do.\" The translator on the Human's ear recited his words in their harsh language. The Human smiled, \"Well I think we should put this war to an end then Ja'lor.\" Ja'lor blinked, \"What do you mean?\" The Human laughed, \"I mean, I want to meet this council. If they have proof of such a thing it's worth a listen. The Orion Federation isn't so arrogant to perpetuate war for such an absurdity. If peace can be made, make it as I say. War is no good to anyone.\" Such an attitude. Ja'lor just nodded.\n\nA day later Ja'lor sat in guest quarters of the Human's flagship on his way to the capital. Wondering what in the abyss just happened.",

Their homeworld stood in wait, their early warning systems had taken a few of our ships, but after heavy fighting, we have made it. Their orbital defenses have been decimated, and now we stand in wait.  Our drones had covered the entire surface of the planet, and intercepted signals show of panicked alien transmissions. Some want to flee, others are preparing to launch their planetbound weapons at us. But we are prepared, we have already began Targeting these sites, confident we can strike before they can get them near us. \n\n\"Admiral, we await your orders\" A young lieutenant  approached me. I look down, and give the order. \"Target the military centers, and decimate their planetal defenses, they won't be leaving this planet\".  It was a heavy and long fought war, but we were on the cusp of complete victory.  Some people had expressed concern about what we were about to do, however, they did not show us any mercy when they had attacked us, nor have they in the decades since that horrible day. It was a day I will never forget......\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn a matter of hours, a blinding flash of light, and the horrified screams of billions had come to an abrupt stop. London, New Delhi, Bejing, Los Angeles, all these cites had been decimated, their populations, and the populations of surrounding areas, all extingished. I was but a young Engineering officer, just having completed my classes. Panic abounded in the base, and in the remaining areas on Earth.  Fortunately, we were prepared, even if we were laughably primitive compared to the might of the force that had just taken out many of our great cities. over half of our population had been slughtered mercillessly.  I had recently recieved a report, like many of the others on the base, about the loss of families. I had lost my wife, and my parents, among with many other relatives. I was devastated, but found myself unable to cry. The weight of the loss was much, and I had felt numb. Even so, I had a job to do, and I had to do it.    \n\nOur telescopes and orbital satellites had found the perpetrator, a lone, massive spaceship, not like anything we had ever seen.  We did not know if it had time to strike again, or if it could at all with the kind of power it had unleashed. It was just within our orbit, and it was close enough to test out our newest weapon. We had recently developed a New type of Nuclear missile we had prepared to use in case the New USSR had declared war. However, they had collapsed upon themselves before they could attack, just like The original USSR had done  over 70 years ago.   The weapon was capable of launching into space, designed to take out space based nuclear satellites that the New USSR had created to launch neutron bombs, and ordinary nukes, from anywhere in orbit. It had an EMP blast that could decimate the electronics of a satellite, turning it into junk. an explosive device took care of the satellite.  We had satellites of our own, and rockets with drones, yet the alien vessel was easily taking them out. This was our last option. We took the last of our nuclear-EMP  rockets, each modified with our neutron warheads,  to take care of the alien crew. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n We launched the missiles, our last of the thousands of missiles we had left. Most, in fact 90% had been destroyed by the ships defenses, but we had anticipated that. It would only take one to cripple the entire vessel.    a couple EMP-Neutron missiles had penetrated the hull, and crippled the vessel.  the crew was killed, the radiation of the neutron missiles had taken out the crew, while leaving the ship mostly intact.  We were victorious, yet at a very high cost. more than half the population was killed that day, yet we had made the most important discovery of our entire history. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince that day, the nations of the world, or what was left of them, had agreed to put aside their differences, and band together. This was to be the most important project the Earth had ever undertaken. We knew the Aliens would return, but we will have their own technology to face them.   \n\nThe motive had remained unclear, but we went to work, combing every inch of the ship, writing, gathering intel, and even dissecting a few alien bodies that had been found inside. The technology was amazing, and in less than a decade, we had already advanced our own technology by nearly 3 centuries.  We had flying vehicles, new weaponry, medicinal advances,  and even our own spaceships\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n in 20 years time.  We had even been able to colonize other worlds in our system, the technology had allowed up to quickly expand our numbers, and to keep them from harm. \n\n  \n\nHowever, we had not had it easy all that time. 25 years since that day, we had recieved reports of 2 outlying colonies going offline, when our ships had made it, we found they were glassed by the same weapons that had attacked the earth before. Apparently they had found out we were still alive. A war had begun, and despite heavy losses, we had had in time, repelled the invaders, and had since began an offensive that had forced them back to their own system.  We had encountered a few other types of ships as well, possibly allies of theirs, yet they were much less powerful than the fleet. What surprised us further is the knowledge that the alien technology was no more advanced than the day they attacked the earth 25 years before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had learned in time that they had planned to exterminate us to expand their own numbers, but as to why they chose to exterminate us to do so is unknown. What's even stranger, was that their attacks had grown weaker and weaker, as if their own numbers were dwindling, even more so than the ones that had died attacking our fleet and colonies. we drew them back rapidly, capturing their colonies one by one. Some had been captured by force, yet many had been deserted, or dying, as if an unknown force had decimated their populace.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Drones were launched, and the weapons had been charged up. The military defenses of the planet were easily overtaken, almost too easily.  Before long, we had made planetfall, and had the rest of the population had quickly surrendered. We had went down to the planet, in specialized spacesuits, that were equipped with Biohazard protection, as well as the usual atmospheric and combat protections. Strangely, instead of a mighty force as we had expected, we came face to face with a race of rather sickly looking creatures. Compared to the bodies we had examined over 40 years prior, they were mostly emaciated, and had signs of disease, as if a plague had hit the planet. \n\nWe interrogated of one of their generals, who had called himself \"Quetsel\". He claimed that they had attacked us, and that they would die if we were not exterminated. He then claimed that the universe was over capacity. He had then compared us to Hyzal, which we learned were a small creature native to their planet, about the size of an earth Rat. They also breed quickly, like our rats. \n\nSergeant Ryan Jones, who was one of our interrogators then punched Quetsel, after which Jones was quickly escorted from the room.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nMuch deliberation as to what to do with the rest of the population. Some advocated for extermination, \"NO mercy!\" was shouted my many people. Others had sought to spare the Ceros, which we learned is what the aliens called themselves as a species.\n\nEventually, we had decided to do the latter, yet , we decided to keep an occupation force on the planet, and to try to see about eradicating the plague, which we had worried would mutate and take our own people out. \n\n A program had been launched to scale back the numbers of Hyzal, which had been identified as the source of the plague.     In the time since we captured Accoursi, the Ceros population, and our own populations had stabilized, mostly due to the reduced desire to expand our own numbers, and due to wars  between ourselves, as well as alien rebel groups raging on unsanctioned, outlying colonies.  Apparently some of us were still fighting. ",

A singular planet has been identified as a potential cause of the problem. In a nearby star system, long ignored by explorers because of the primitive life form, the galactic council has discovered that the primitive life form has developed surprising ways to constantly reproduce. The planet is not host to almost 7 Billion people. Intergalatic Council President Hil'Lary Klin'ton announced today that the council will endeavour to make contact with these species and discuss their greater role in the universe and the problems that they are causing. Exploration ships have charted the planet previously and credit the reproductive capability to the tremendous resources on the planet include a substance called water.  While the Intergalatic Council is normally against contacting other species in this overt way, the present crisis seems to have made it necessary. The council was split on the decision, 22-20. The bigger question is if this vote will effect the next galactic elections, in 2 universe cycles. In other news today.....",

            "comment": "\"I told you they were deranged.\"\n\nKhala had never met a human before. Even after the explosive news of their existence had broken ten years ago, interactions between the primates and the established civilisations of the galaxy had been sparse. Something about their feral intensity and the sheer freakish youth of their kind was too much for the Hola'i, the Zadaians and, well, pretty much everyone. On top of that, her own work was in theoretical population limit theory, rather than the applied work that now revolved almost entirely around the discovery of that wet blue planet and the maniacs somehow living on every corner of it. She'd only agreed to this meeting as a courtesy; Albara the Raindrop had asked her to, and it would have been rude to refuse her mentor. Still, she couldn't quite believe Albara had brought her to hear this madness.\n\n\"It's not deranged, Albara, just the product of a different outlook. You and Khala are looking at me like this because a Hola'i or a Shostaran would indeed have to be legitimately crazy to start thinking about this. It's so far outside the boundaries of what you think of as science that you treat it as inviolable, a natural law-\"\n\nKhala couldn't listen to this any longer. \"It is a natural law, you lunatic! Your existence is the most comprehensive proof we've ever had of it!\"\n\nThe human turned to her, pupils dilating and nostrils flaring slightly. Gods, thought Khala, but I'd almost prefer to be speaking to a proper predator with massive teeth and muscles. These creatures treat everything in the universe as a hunt; I can smell the adrenaline coming off her and see her brain waiting to trap me in my own words. \"But a natural law is only a natural law once we can find the explanation for it. We still don't know the why of the hard sapience limit, but your most recent publication gives us a clue.\"\n\nKhala and Albara both did the species equivalent of a blink. \n\n\"Your mathematics are bulletproof, Khala, and they lead to a clear conclusion: the sapience limit is not possible without an organising intelligence directing it from outside. Something exists outside our universe, and it sets the rules. And as a human, I'm not a big fan of rules. I know your species - and the other Connected civilisations - tend to be very careful about following the rules, but it's time to shake that off. You have a choice. We can either work together to remove the sapience limit by breaking out of this universe and dealing with whatever operates it, or you can all go back to hoping the human population remains stable for the rest of time.\"\n\nKhala thought. Everything the human said was right, crazy though it sounded. She glanced at Albara and could tell his thought process was leading to the same conclusion. \"We're in.\"\n\nThe human grinned, teeth bared in a signal to her fellow hunters. Khala felt an impossible thrill as she realised she'd become the first of her species ever to hunt. \"Let's go find God and murder Him.\"",

With no other species in the galaxy, the unborn only had to worry about their own people. The device killed those who rose above a preset population, and it saved their people from dying out eons ago. However, one day, the plague struck. In the beginning, it was just murmurs. A couple thousand dead here, a million there. For many, it was a godsend as their lifetimes can often be dull and repetitive. For the first eon when this problem was observed, it was chalked up to suicide. However, that changed. A hundred standard rotations ago, the amount of deaths spiked. It was a disaster that their society couldnt comprehend. Finally, the age old and intimidating question arose: \"Had another species risen to intelligence?\" The galaxy was big and yet it never happened before. The counsel was in an uproar. Their dynasties and traditions were threatened by the haphazard die-offs, which had no regard for social class. Meanwhile, Blorg's device was more of a legend than an actual device, and many only thought it was an empty threat from the government (In reality, their population remained in a slight decrease for generations). The counsel quickly convened to order the screening of the galaxy for this other species.\n\n\"We must destroy them\" commented raxus the 7th, who proceeded to collapse onto the floor\n\n\"Our survival as a species required the finding and destruction of this relic of antiquity\" Serene trade minister moorveus uttered before disintegrating on sight\n\nThen the Head general and holder of the command orb stood, to give a solemn proposition: \"We must both squash these pretenders to our infinite power, and simultaneously launch a tactical strike on Orbeus, for the device must be located on our 5th planet!\" He then screamed and was shredded into multiple pieces.\n\nThe holder of knowledge sat quietly as these people were shredded before their eyes, and shakily stood up to state their opinion \"MmmMmMMaybe....

            "comment": "For the first time ever, the Galactic Union had a hard decision to make, and so they planned the best way to make it: a big arena was set up near the center of the galaxy where all the citizens could come to watch the Counselors expose and discuss a sort of problem so strange and new, no one knew how to deal with.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nOne of the Counselor began with a presentation. \u201cThe research was conclusive, it had been tested thoroughly by scientists from every planet in the Galactic Union: as you know, there\u2019s a law of nature that restricts the amount conscient view points our galaxy can hold. So every sentient life is linked, every energy equalled. And yet, for the last centuries we have suffered great losses with no apparent life given back to the galaxy.\u201d She pauses, a troubled look in her face.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nAnother Counselor, noticing his colleagues distress, jumps forward to complete the thought.\n\u201cBut now we have found conclusive evidence that nature has, in fact, been giving back.\u201d. The crowd gasps in horror, but he continues. \u201cWe are very sorry to say that the Galactic Unions Scientists Association, despite its best efforts, has overlooked a small planet near the edge of the galaxy where a sentient, although primitive, race has been reproducing at an alarming rate.\u201d The audience bursts in talk. The Counselor looks over at his colleague, expecting some help.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nShe takes a rock-like storage device and shows a hologram of a model-human. \u201cThe humans, as they call themselves, have been sentient for thousands of years and it would be expected that they would have reached maturity to contact de Galactic Union by now - no race has ever taken more than a couple thousand years to do so. That is odd, but not destructive. What is destructive, though, it that In the last couple of centuries, their population has exploded, causing the imbalance we suffer through to this day.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nA third Counselor approaches the hologram. \u201cWe are gathered here because we, as a Union, need to decide how to proceed. To let the humans fester or to control the situation.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nThe crowd roars. They want an end to the senseless deaths.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\u201cWait, we can\u2019t underestimate the value of their lives, just as we value ours. We have studied the psyche and history of the humans and I would like to point out that this spike in natality is not natural to humans, it was a unfortunate combination of bad luck and a few close minded individuals that set up such a sad course of existence for the entire race.\u201d The first Counselor says.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\u201cIn fact, I would theorize the high procreation and the lack of maturity are linked. When put in a state of subservience and of forced ignorance, the human mind couldn\u2019t help but become self-destructive. They created a cycle of not using their consciousness in order to gain momentary pleasure and because of the momentary pleasure not troubling themselves with the full use of consciousness.\u201d Said the second.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\u201cThe humans enslaved their own minds by their greed. But they might have redeeming qualities still. The average life-span of a human is of less than 100 years! What did any one of us accomplish in our first 100 years?\u201d Continued the first.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nThe third Counselor, although touched by the arguments, disagrees. \u201cWhat you fail to expose is the aggressive, petty nature of the humans, they aren\u2019t like us at all!\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\u201cLook at yourselves. We are all aggressive and small in our nature, we have learned to not let it get the better of us, can\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\u201cNone of the peoples in the Union needed any sort of guidance to achieve the requirements to enter the Union. It\u2019s not so difficult, we only expect a responsibility to reason and to the community. They have neither and are putting those of us who do have in danger.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one to rule out that we may need to take severe action here, I don\u2019t wish to put the lives of the peoples that have proven their service to the betterment of the community in jeopardy, and i have to admit i do see that their lives aren\u2019t on par with our own. Their lives destroy, both there on their planet and here, million of light years away.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\u201cAnd they only last a fraction of what ours last, by their own failure to apply they millennia of existence to their betterment.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\u201cYes, but doesn\u2019t it make us just as bad as the humans to exterminate an entire race for our benefit?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nThe crowd is silent, thinking.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid they are too far gone. But maybe, if they are so self-destructive, we don\u2019t need to exterminate them. They can do it themselves.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nThe second Counselor sprints up. \u201cI have an idea. I warn you, it\u2019s a weird one, but stick with me for a minute. Having viewed all the files about humans history I think we have a chance to try a unique sort of both experiment and non-destructive solution to the human infestation. We are looking at the galaxies limitation in number of observers in a literal way. The galaxy can\u2019t be observed by more than a set number of points, it would overload its rendering and glitch us all out of existence. So nature has a mechanism for making sure we never reach too many view-points by killing a random observer once a new one comes to existence. But what if we can diminish the view-points in other ways? Maybe by combining two observers view-points or even by turning an observer away from the universe and onto, basically, a wall.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe crowd cheers. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nThe third Counselor steps in. \u201cHumans might be prime for an experiment like this, with their tendency to subservience and, if I recall the files correctly, long history of subscribing to totalitarian attitudes.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nThe first Counselor this for a moment. \u201cAnd by not killing them all, we would be giving them a chance to achieve betterment some day, when their consciousness is strong enough to break the confinement.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\u201cThat would be a historically slow maturation, but where there is life, there is hope.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\u201cOur counsel is settled then. We move forward unless there\u2019s anyone against it?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nNo sound comes from the crowd, indicating its support to the motion.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s settled then. The humans will probably not even notice a thing.\u201d",

Kill all these children being born?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly. There\u2019s another way. You can be immortal without killing anyone on this planet\u201d\n\n\u201cOk.

            "comment": "So the galactic counsel creates the transcendence initiative to preserve as many sentient souls as possible by digitalizing consciousness and uploading them into a virtual world. \n\nHowever, only the central nervous system can currently be preserved, and deaths continue occur in an unpredictable manner. Live hosts are still at risk of spontaneous death, where only the sturdiest of heart still offer their minds in the effort to digitalize consciousness.\n\nThose fearful of death and who wish to stay alive volunteer their organic bodies to be cryogenically frozen, until the initiative is complete.\n\nThose demanding a deeper resolve for justice from this indefensible reaping of innocent lives, tirelessly brave against death itself to reach the truth. Scouts and researchers task themselves about the galaxy to determine the cause of this phenomenon.\n\nIn the end, will it matter if the cause is stopped? Or, is it better if lives can be saved in this new digital haven? Can there be a future for life in the galaxy?\n\n--\n\nThousands of years pass. Sentient life as it is known has taken new form, sans organics.\n\nConsciousnesses are instanced into cybernetic bodies, retaking physical form. Death has become a theoretical myth.\n\nThe future is cold. Planets once vividly exuberant with life are covered in metal and glass. Other celestial bodies have been mined to their cores to build trillions of siphons around stars, concentrating their energy into beams that span the cosmos. There is little reason to rely on biological platforms, except for aesthetic purposes - for the few who still have appreciation for it.\n\nA new webway allows explorers to traverse the galaxy without risk to one's own life. Individuals can upload themselves and travel the webway across networks of stars as packets of data, or may explore the physical in a remotely fabricated body.\n\nThis new reality has protected life, and given it a way to prosper. It has made the irreplaceable, permanent. But in gaining immortality, is consciousness still valuable?",

The bipeds were out there killing each other and it still wasn't enough.\n\nHe passed a tired hand over his orange face (and wasn't that one a joke, he'd been really worried they'd pick up on his unusual skin tone but the bipeds were really, almost adorably stupid) and pulled off his orange gloves to phase into the communicator.\n\nA familiar face popped up on screen, one that millions hated...\n'Requesting status update agent K'\n\n' All ongoing projects are being maintained. The bipeds are however reproducing beyond control. It is, quite frankly alarming.'\n'Hang on, we've got agent P calling in with an update.'\n\nA cheerful voice popped up :\n\n'Hey guys! How's it going?? Been hearing a lot about your most recent accomplishments agent DT! I sense a promotion..!'\n\nDT secretly smiled to himself while keeping a stern face. His work was after all, far from over...\n\n'These damn bipeds, constantly breeding beyond control and without any consideration for anyone else!' K muttered.\n\n'Now, now, you know they don't know any better. I mean, you'd think they would have caught on to what we're up to, and still, still, they keep asking for more. You can't expect a subpar species to have an understanding that's so sophisticated, can you?'\n\n'I suppose you're right, D - but I have to say, I really do miss the family you know? I wish they'd just hurry up and die really. I thought we'd hit on a winning formula with all the vote modifications and obvious lying, but clearly, it'll take some more time.'\n\n' I know P, I know. I miss home and the family too. Well, what can you do? The life of billions is at stake here after all.. and I feel that the day I can give the order for the nukes is almost here. We'll be home soon.'\n\nThe three agents looked at each other, and silently acknowledged the challenging days ahead. With a nod, K logged off, leaving P and DT to chat.\n\n'You know D, it's not as straightforward as they told us it would be.'\n\n'I know P, I know.'\n\nWith a worried expression, P sighed deeply and logged off.\n\nD refreshed the feed in front of him, sighing deeply. Someone knocked at the door. \n\n'Everything alright, Mr President?'\n\n'Yes, yes it is.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry, that was written in a hurry but oh well\n:)",

Their minds cannot withstand the intrusion of the augments on their bodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they are able to fight, and that is what is necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am appalled at your lack of understanding, my lord. After this war is over, what shall be left of our valiant men who serve this nation? Shall they be able to return to their families? To their fields? To their occupations?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can fight, that is what we need them for.\u201d Lord Tytos reinforced evenly.\n \nThe Chief Magister lost his temper at that moment, \u201cYou are a fool and shall bring about the downfall of this nation, a downfall much more insidious than what our foes wish for us! You are damning untold numbers of men to a fate worse than death, a fate where they are but machines for this war and little else. Will you be able to stand before their wives, their mothers, their children and explain why they will no longer be the man they once knew? Can you?!\u201d\n\nLord Tytos took his eyes away from watching a man being led away by two other Magisters who were having to almost physically lead the man off. \u201cIt is a necessary evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cNecess\u2026 necessary evil? My lord, this has gone too far.\u201d The Chief Magister said in shock.\n\n\u201cMayhaps\u2026 but we may have to go farther.\u201d",

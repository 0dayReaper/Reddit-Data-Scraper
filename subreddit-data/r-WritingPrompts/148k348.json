                    "comment": "The station had been in dire need of repair in this sector for years. Crime here was so commonplace that the police no longer bothered coming in and the few they did send this way were total rookies. Callie had drawn the short straw among the force to get put on South Station detail. It wasn't the first time, but she didn't mind.\n\nSouth Station was named after the original compass shaped design of the station. A total relic now with the station becoming vastly larger and more open, South was cramped and narrow. Plenty of little spots to duck into and hide away in.\n\nCallie hated South Station. The walls here were on the 'Do not shoot' list since virtually every surface was practically against hard space. The standard issue slug thrower would go through a station wall like a finger through wet paper, so anyone on South detail had to deal with the little stunner gun instead.\n\nThe criminals here had zero issues spacing someone or venting the hull with their own weapons when the police came into South Station. Callie knew that protocol let her keep a low profile, so she dressed for the occasion. T-shirt, loose trousers, work boots andthe look of someone pulling a fifteener at the refinery on the other side of the station was how she chose to dress this time.\n\nOne month rotation was the usual, and Callie had made herself comfortable only a week in. She knew the ins and outs of South Station better than most having been put there more times than she could count. The worst had been a four month stretch of back to backs in South Station. It had afforded her the luxury of her own place inside the area.\n\nShe knew a few of the locals. One of whom had been her on again and off again girlfriend of the last five years. Every so often there would be a fight between the two and Callie would find herself put in one of the nicer districts and Laurie would cuss her out and call her names. The breakup would last however long it took for Callie to get back to South Station to fix the problem.\n\nToday was going to be the day she tried to win Laurie back, but this time she wanted to bring her back with her to Central Station to her real home. Get her away from all of this awful hell. At least, that was the plan. Plans never went to the script in South Station.\n\nCallie had headed out to find Laurie and only found herself stuck in the middle of one of South Station's turf wars. Laser fire filled the narrow hall as Callie tried to find a way through. She was glad to have at least brought her oxygen kit this time. Something had told her that morning she'd need it.\n\nStunning a handful, Callie noticed Laurie in the crowd trying to get away from the action and called to her. \n\n\"Oh thank God...Callie. It's so bad. Half the district is either on fire or hard vacuum. We have to get out. I'm sorry for everything I said. I've been beating myself up ever since.\" Laurie's face was full of panic and a little bloodied from where she had banged her head against a doorway hatch.\n\n\"Don't worry about it. I was coming to get you out anyways. I'm done with all of this here. South Station is becoming too dangerous and rumour has it, they're going to just jettison it.\" Callie had been right. The government of the station had decided that the South Station sector had one month to be informed and comply or be jettisoned. \n\nThe two stuck close together as Callie tried her best to fight back through the sector. A blaster shot clipped Callie, hitting her arm as she stunned the shooter. Coming out of this whole fiasco unscathed was never going to be easy, but at least Callie knew she and Laurie were only a short distance to the airlock that separated South Station from the rest. \n\n\"Thank god. Laurie, come with me. You'll be happy with me in Central. I love you and I was going to ask anyways, but I want you to move in with me, out of South Station.\" Callie smiled at her girlfriend, hoping for a good answer.\n\n\"South Station isn't safe. I'll come with you.\" Laurie said as she sighed. \"Besides, I don't exactly have anywhere to go if they jettison the sector. I love you too. Let's go get you patched up.\"",

Home to the King of he region and also one of the largest cities for several hundred miles, it wasn't unheard of for travellers to spend weeks just to see the walls. \n\nAlistair came for more than the view. A farm boy from a week's journey away, Alistair made it a point to travel to Riston for anything the farm needed, even when it wasn't practical. After all, he got to hide who he was here and had gotten into the royal castle on more than one occasion.\n\nIt had been on one of these occasions that the reasons for his visits to Riston became more frequent. There had been a young prince who had been cursed by a local warlock to be doomed to live life as a woman until true love was found. Naturally this had caused quite the scene and many tied and failed to break the curse. \n\nAlistair however, had known Mika since before the curse. The two had gotten on well and upon learning of the curse, Alistair had come running back to Riston. Mika had been inconsolable for days. Alistair knew the pain well.\n\nMika had been the first one told about Alistair's wish. It was almost a jealous note when Alistair told Mika he had wished their roles reversed, for Alistair would have never tried to get rid of the curse. \n\nMika was angry, slapping Alistair and kicking them out of the castle. Alistair didn't know what had gone wrong. Deep down Alistair knew he had wanted to be a woman for years, dressing and acting as one in Riston. Maybe that was why Mika had gotten so angry, the reveal that Alistair wasn't who she had been saying she was all those years. \n\nIt had been a tough few weeks after, but Alistair had remained in Riston. The farm would take care of itself in the meanwhile, but there was a relationship to patch that needed her attention more. Hopefully there would be time to break the curse and get back the only person Alistair had loved.",

                    "comment": "It was a nice day to be fishing out along the banks of the Connecticut. Rural farm life had been the way of things since the Civil War had died down. Not that it had affected this part of the world much, much to Harriet's delight. It had meant not worrying about her brother or father going off to fight. \n\nHer great grandfather had served in the Revolution, and the stories that had been handed down made it sound like it was something to be avoided. Still, the only fighting that had even remotely come close had still been miles and miles away from  the tiny village of Apthorp. \n\nThe rolling mountains provided the loveliest backdrop as Harriet lazed about in the heat of a lovely July afternoon. The bridge put her in the unique place of being between two States at the same time. A lovely little novelty that Harriet always enjoyed.\n\n\"Any luck yet?\" A voice drifted from behind her. Thankfully it was a familiar one.\n\nHarriet smiled to see Sam walking up the road. \"Hey Sam. Nothing yet. I had better luck yesterday. Caught four trout and a few perch.\"\n\n\"Not bad. Bet you ate decently.\" Sam grunted as they sat down next to Harriet.\n\n\"About as good as you can on fish.\" Harriet leaned against Sam, still smiling.\n\nSam was an unusual person. Harriet had met them quite a few years back and had been informed after their first time hanging out that Sam was unusual. To Harriet, Sam looked like a girl, talked like one, and even had a girl's name in Samantha, but Sam preferred to be called Sam and not be addressed as a girl. So naturally Harriet tried addressing her friend like a boy and found that didn't work either. Over time, Sam just was Sam to Harriet.\n\nThe two hit their teens and Harriet had asked Sam out to the dance at the end of school and the two became the topic of some scandal in town as they dated. Now in their twenties, Harriet still couldn't help but smile and fall in love every time she saw Sam.\n\n\"Why don't you use some of your charm and help me get some fish or we'll both be hungry tonight.\" Harriet said as she Kissed Sam's cheek.\n\n\"Why Miss Harriet I do believe you are mocking my skills at fishing. Give me that fishing pole and I'll have us some dinner in no time.\" Sam said with a laugh as they returned the kiss.\n\n\"You silly goose. One of these days you're gonna have to marry me or people will keep talking about how I'm gonna be a spinster.\" Harriet laughed as she handed over the fishing pole.\n\nSam chuckled. \"Tell you what. You beat me at fishing tomorrow, and I'll ask your dad same day.\"\n\nHarriet kissed Sam and smiled. \"It's a bet.\"",

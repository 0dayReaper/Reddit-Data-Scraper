            "comment": "\"Tch!\" I think to myself... \"Is there any way to beat this guy?\"\n\nThe blocker slowly approaches me and I back away. I could feel the hate seething from his glare, even though my super-empathic abilities were nullified by him. \n\n\"Magicals like you are a disease, and I am the cure.\" He spits. \n\n\"Yeah, and not a pretty one, I can tell ya that!\" I retort.\n\n\"For that comment, your death will be extra painful...\" The blocker bellowed, reaching for his weapon. \n\nI knew I had no shot against this guy since I can't use my magic against him, but I did remember something else... \n\n***My ace in the hole...***\n\nIt was a technique that I had known ever since I was a child, and had only ever used when all the chips were down. I felt like this was the time to use it. I subtly tapped my foot against the ground as the blocker drew his weapon.\n\n\"Any last words, Magical?\" he asked.\n\n\"Actually, yes...\" I responded. \"Four, to be precise...\"\n\nThe blocker raised their eyebrow. \"Oddly specific number...\", he thought to himself. \"But I do want to hear what he has to say before I send him to where he belongs...\"\n\nThe blocker then said, \"Go on...\"\n\n***Big mistake...***\n\nHe just gave me the opportunity to use my final gambit move! And use it, I did...\n\n***\"RUN FOR YOUR LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVES!!!\"***\n\nI bolted for it, running away from the blocker as fast as I could without the magical boost I would usually get. The blocker facepalmed.\n\n\"Should've seen this coming...\", He said before giving chase.\n\nI looked over my shoulder to see if he was following me. I really shouldn't have done that...\n\n\"THERE IS NO ESCAPE!\" he barked.\n\nI knew if I wanted to defeat this guy, since none of my magical abilities worked against him, I would have to rely on my wit. So I hid out in the abandoned opera house and got to work.\n\nMinutes later, everything was ready, so I hid in the rafters and waited...\n\nThe blocker kicks the door open and saunters into the opera house, looking left and right for any sign of me. \"I know you're in here, Magical! So do yourself a favor and come out!\" he said, unaware that the boobytrap I had set has just been sprung. Out of the corner of his eye, a vaguely-humanoid shape appeared. Quickly, he drew his weapon and fired it, cutting the cardboard cutout clean in two. \n\n\"Magical terminated.\" he said, clearly celebrating too soon, as without the cardboard cutout's weight to hold it down, the rope is released, knocking into a toy train which moves it into a line of dominoes, knocking the first one down. The dominoes fall into each other with the last in the lineup falling into a bucket attached to a pulley system. The bucket is pulled down by the weight of the domino, lifting a small weight that released a golf ball that rolls down the track leading to a book teetering dangerously close to the edge. The blocker watches every event unfold individually with a confusion he barely suppresses. \"When did the Magical have time to set all this up?\" he asks himself as the golf ball knocks the book over the edge, releasing the fishing line that triggers the axe which cuts the chandelier's chain!\n\nLike the bridge in Super Mario Bros., the axe is the component that sends the chandelier crashing down on top of the blocker's head, knocking him unconscious.\n\n\"It worked!\" I cheer as I climb down from the rafters and inspect the damage.\n\nFeeling more of my magic return to me, I cast a spell to repair the chandelier and fix the chain. The blocker just lied there, out cold.\n\n\"I can only imagine the splitting headache you'll have when you wake up\", I say to him as I pick him up and carry him to a lamppost to tie to and wait for the police to pick him up from.\n\nAs I ran off to call the police, a question seared itself into my mind... \"Why? Why did he want to eradicate people with magical powers so badly? What's his deal? Are there more like him?\".\n\nI shuddered faintly at the thought of an anti-magic hate group existing, but brushed it off quickly. \"I shouldn't worry about that for now.\" I tell myself \"It's way too nice of a day!\"\n\nAs if on cue, my stomach starts to growl.\n\n\"Now that I think about it...\" I start. \"All that fighting against him to survive has made me hungry! Where do I want to eat?\"",

            "comment": "It was strange, disconcerting. I imagine this is what it would feel like to go blind or deaf \u2014 for a sense, a feeling that you have accepted your whole life to suddenly become absent. I thrusted my hand towards the sky, twirled my hands in front of me, spinning and flailing, but no lighting rained down, no fire burst forth, no magical shield appeared, and I just appeared as a rhythmically impaired dancer, judging by the uproarious laughter from the stands. In one last, fruitless attempt I attempted to gather a swirling ball of wind in my hands, but felt only normal, still air. \n\n\u201cWhaddya think, eh?\u201d A cloaked figure chuckled from across the arena. It was infuriating, how he sat there placidly watching in amusement. After an embarrassingly long time, it dawned on me; I\u2019d always heard rumors of powers like these existing, the power to shroud someone\u2019s aura, prevent their mind from reaching out into the ethereal plane around them, and therefore ceasing their connection to power, but I had never fully considered that it was actually possible, much less that I would meet one. \n\nI spun around to face my warden, a look of equal parts despair and disgust etching itself into my features. \u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d \n\nOnce again, the thief let out a chuckle, grating on my already thin nerves. \u201cWell, I think you\u2019ve figured it out, haven\u2019t ya,\u201d they said, yawning and pulling out a cutlass. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about you sorcerers: without your connection to your precious magic \u2014 mana? \u2014 well, anyways, you\u2019re nothing. I\u2019d suggest you surrender now, as not to humiliate yourself.\u201d From the way they said it, it was clear this was a rehearsed line. I edged away from the advancing brute, instinctively touching my hands to my thighs in an attempt to enhance my speed, only to have another moment of panic when I felt just as horrifically sluggish as before. \n\nI began to limp as anesthetizing magic faded, revealing unhealed gashes from previous fights, and my hair fell in my face as my magical hairclip vanished. My boots, held tight by magic cinches, began to loosen without that little bit of sustained mana I usually provided, and I was forced to abandon them as I continued to walk. All the while, the magic-blocker strolled towards me, as if they had all the time in the world. They must have thought the fight won. They would\u2018ve been right \u2014 most sorcerers without continuous connection to the ethereal plane would be helpless \u2014 but I had one last ditch card up my sleeve. As they approached, I steadied myself, shorter now without the height boost my boots would normally provide, and looked my opponent dead in the eyes.\n\nThey turned to the audience and crowed, \u201cAw, look at the poor thing, trying to fight. You lot are all the same. Always thinking you stand a chance. Pity, really.\u201d At that moment, I struck. This bastard had been betting on my surrender, or at least an easy victory. They\u2019d been betting on my not having a weapon, my outfit\u2019s reliance on magic, my resolve crumbling under the emptiness. What they hadn\u2019t been betting on was my lack of self-preservation. I reached into myself, within the wall that had been constructed around my mind, down into my heart, the blood pumping ever so consistently, into the energy that flowed through me, and pulled. Suddenly, I felt a year older, but that feeling that had gone missing had returned. I lunged forward, expecting the reflexive swing, and using that brief moment of vulnerability to my advantage. Swirling red energy burst from my palm, wrapping around my opponent\u2019s throat. Their eyes bulged as I squeezed, and the blade clattered to the cold stone floor. I watched with a mixture of horror and awe as the blood-colored energy drained the life from those no-longer-snarky eyes. Now, they were filled with abject terror, and I loved it. I squeezed harder, their eyes bulged wider, their airway constricting ever tighter, little spots of red appearing first from their nose, then their mouth. The grossest part was when it began to seep out of the popped veins in their eyes, closely followed by ears. \n\n\u201c\u2026unexpected\u2026 unseen magic\u2026 winner!\u2026questions\u2026\u201d By the time I realized they were announcing my victory, my opponent was long-since dead. As I walked out of the colosseum, I realized that although I had regained my connection to the surrounding mana, that feeling of the mana coursing through my own veins had not disappeared. Even stranger, I felt different, rejuvenated, younger. I felt incredible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt guilty, the first time I lured an unsuspecting civilian into an alleyway. But it felt so good, the rejuvenation, the life. By the time I was onto my fifth, I didn\u2019t really feel anything at all.",

Our spectacle had drawn a small crowd of people watching from a distance, some filming on their phones.\n\nOr rather, my magical energies had drawn the crowd. If the blocker had done his job right he would've caught me unaware and made me disappear me without a fight. \n\nEither way, he was lying dead on the ground, a hole through his chest, his head missing helf his head and one of his horns. I was still holding onto the double barreled sawn off shotgun I keep underneath my coat. I looked at one of the cameras and said \"guns are usually faster than demons\" with a shrug while reloading. I picked up my bag and turned around.\n\nI focused my energy, blinked, and I was back at home in my estate on the island. I sighed and tossed my Taco Bell on the dinner table.

            "comment": "Balthazar's Incendiary Maelstrom swirled about us, scorching the desert sands, blackening the gilding on the circle of sphinxes which formed this place of combat.\n\nIt didn't touch him.\n\nA thousand years I had waited, guarding this portal to the mortal plane. Demons, Imps, Giants and Desecrons had all attempted to cross over. I had defeated each of them in turn, fulfilling my purpose.\n\nThis being differed from the rest. Twelve cubits high, he towered over me. But fleet of foot he was, and agile too. Two horns curved from his head, indicating his immense power. A staff of malachite he wielded, that drained magic. Incised into his very flesh were Encanta and Dolorata to nullify, to absorb, to dissipate all magic. We had fought for hours, yet not one mark on his demonic flesh had I been able to raise. He had laughed at Felixiar's Cauldron, ignored the Diabulum Mortum, and shrugged aside even Cassandra's Abrupt Impalement. And yet he had not even attacked me, choosing instead to weather my assaults, laughing gently. He radiated immense power, immense evil, what desolation he would bring!\n\nI had channeled immense torrents of power, I had flung fire and ice, stone and star, and had failed. I was almost drained. Weariness filled me. I was losing. I feared greatly what he would do if he prevailed. A new age of darkness would unfold. My failing.\n\n\"You are weak\". The creature spoke for the first time. \"My time has come. My Master has sent me forth to make a path for Him. But I shall make my own Kingdom, where I alone shall rule.\"\n\nI hefted my staff above my head and slowly spun it, drawing in energy for one last gambit. Slowly, so slowely it seemed to me, I gathered my magicks for one more strike, a summoning. I pointed my staff straight up to the boiling sky above me, and a bolt of sizzling white energy burst forth, towering up to infinity. It's sizzling brightness seared my vision and caused the demon to throw up his hands to shield his eyes. \n\n\"So you do have one weakness\", I thought. \"Let us see if you have another\".\n\nAbruptly, the light failed, and darkness prevailed once more. The Demon strode to me, drawing from its scabbard a long thin dagger. \"You are drained and empty,\" he sneered. This was true. In truth, I could barely stand. Yet my summoning had succeeded. As he approached me, I turned and hid from him what I had summoned. He tilted his head and craned his neck to see what I was concealing in my hands. \n\n\"Do you want to see, Demon?\" He stopped, only an arm's reach away. \"Do you dare to challenge me further?\"\n\n\"I do.\" His face was wary now, having lost some of its confidence. \n\n\"DO YOU THINK YOU CAN BEST ME?\" I screamed.\n\nHe adjusted his stance, and tightened his grip on both staff and dagger. \"I do.\"\n\nI spread out what was in my hand, twirled and thrust my hand at his now flinching face.\n\n\"Then pick a card, any card\".",

Are you a queer? No. Here. A real man needs a real weapon.\"\n\nGod I'm glad he's dead.\n\nWhy I continued to carry his gun all this time, I can't really say for certain. It sat on my hip silently, the antithesis of everything I stood for. Or thought I stood for.\n\nI could've lost its greasy weight at any time.\n\nBut I didn't.\n\nAnd right now, in this moment, I'm so glad I opted to hold on to this curse of my father.\n\nCause the magic is failing me.\n\nAnd only cold iron can keep me alive.\n\nI stop thinking and level the business end of dad's old revolver on the blocker across from me. For a moment I can see a special recognition in his eyes as he locks onto the gun's slick barrel.\n\nHe knows he's dead. And his eyes flick up to mine.\n\nThe blocker begins to turn just as I pull the trigger.\n\nA roar of thunder cracks the air. The blocker's head splits in two.

Completely defenseless I try to teleport away but my body remains. With a sadistic laugh he kicks me in my chest and sends me stumbling down before unsheathing his sword. I'm frozen in fear,  watching in terror as he slowly approaches me twirling his weapon.\n\n\"St-stay back!\" I shout,  scooting back.\n\n\"Scared?\" He shoots back with a grin before slicing me across the chest with his blade .\n\nLetting out a cry of pain I scramble back and somehow manage to get back on my feet. My hand goes to the cut and I almost pass out, never before have I been hurt so badly, my healing powers always fix the minor cuts and scrapes I have endured. Trembling, I lift my eyes to face him. He appears completely relaxed, leaning back and still smiling at me as if we're good friends. Somehow I find my voice\n\n\"You have no clue who you're up against\" \n\nChuckling, he turns to me fully. Despite his calm demeanor I can see a crazed madness in his eyes.\n\n\"Oh really? I'm the one in over my head? You really think that after what I've shown you?\"\n\nI have to struggle to hold eye contact, I can feel my panic rising again but I can't afford to back down now.\n\n\"I don't want to use my strongest power.\"\n\nHe stares at me for a moment, then bursts out laughing. I keep my composure as he buckles over from amusement, and after a while he finally calms down enough to lift his head and speak\n\n\"You still think you can do anything to me! It's hilarious how stubborn some of you are!\" He gets out between giggles\n\nLetting out a sigh as he stands up straight he glares at me, slowly stepping forward\n\n\"Kill me, then. Try your spell and see what happens. You know what's going to happen? Nothing!\"\n\nHe's really getting riled up now, speeding up his approach. I'm stepping back but holding my gaze, trying not to panic.\n\n\"You're the one that has no clue what they're up against, anything you can throw at me I can stop. Your magic shields and fire blasts and lightning strikes, nothing you do will work.\"\n\nHe lets go of his sword and lets it clatter to the ground before throwing out his arms.\n\n\"So then try, you magical coward. Try and fail. Because I have a power far beyond yours or anyone's. I could block even the strongest wizards spell, I would know, I've done it before. You're not the first, fool, hundreds of other just like you have fallen to me\"\n\nHe begins to ramble, his words tumbling out like he's been waiting to say them to someone. Wanting to speak of his atrocities for a long, long time.\n\n\"First it was a small village, then a town, then a city. Have you heard of the massacres and wondered who could have done such horrible things? You have your answer now, it was me. Me who burned the towns of the north, me who wiped out almost every village of the south, me who killed your great heros. All of them fell so easily, nothing without their magic. Why do you think you are better than those that have already fallen?\"\n\n\nI stare steadily at him, looking into his eyes I see nothing but madness. I can't afford to let him get away from me. To hurt anyone else. I remember hearing the news of the burnings, of the killings, of the horror and pain. I will not let it happen again.\n\n\" You leave me no choice\" I whisper\n\nThen I pull out my Glock and shoot him",

            "comment": "*Power surged through the old wizard\u2019s body.* \n\nThe sounds of textbooks and writing tools rustling in backpacks accompanied the crowd of students as they rushed out into the university courtyard to watch the battle taking place above them. Most of the onlookers' gazes also fell to Kaiden, at the front of the crowd. Being the Master Magi\u2019s nephew gave him a lot of publicity, Alec was the most renown Magi of all time after all, and the greatest Master the university has ever had. During his employment, student scores have doubled in all areas, especially Spellcasting and Strategics courses. His uncle always figured out the path to victory in battle. It was his gift as a Master of Strategics, and Kaiden hoped he would be putting this on full display momentarily in the battle ensuing up on the cliffside. \n\nAll the training Alec had subjected Kaiden to over the years made him strong and adept for his age, much more advanced than his other classmates. Whenever Kaiden thinks he is almost on the same level as his uncle though, he gets humbled swiftly. Alec's words of wisdom are always echoing in his head: \"*Failure is not your problem, Kai, it's doubt. You can fail in your head before the fight even begins.*\" The sight of his uncle grounds Kaiden, streaks of blue lightning  rippling from his body. Kaiden could almost smell the enigma building in the atmosphere. It made the air feel heavy, like the slow dying weight only an autumn air could normally bring.\r  \n\r  \nHigh on the rocky cliffside, the smell of smoldering ash crowded the air, and within it stood the wise magi. A look of exhausted bewilderment hung on his face among all its wrinkled glory. The spells he had been casting for over an hour at the menace before him continued to prove futile. The burning pain of a thousand suns that his fireballs should be causing the creature were just a tickle across the tattooed carapace covering its chest. His barrage of lightning bolts, over one billion volts instead tamed to a child's meager poke after rubbing their socks on the carpet for too long. \u201cThe putrid Magics of our society come to an end today, old man!\u201d the creature bellowed meticulously. \u201cI would consider sparing your life because your combat skills have impressed me this day. But you have taught the ways of your vile Magics to far too many souls. For that, I damn you to burn with the rest of them.\u201d The creature\u2019s voice boomed across the rocky cliffsides surrounding them. The golden gaze of the seven foot being that stood before Alec was incapacitating. Golden orbs seared through the sockets of its bony helm, with numerous sharp spikes protruding like a blossom of snakes. Its gaze was bright, but something dark within them pierced outward and took hold of Alec. \r  \n\r  \n\"My spells really have no effect on this creature?\" Alec muttered under his breath, shaking his tired head in disbelief. The thought of defeat towered ominously over him, the feeling of pins and needles spreading over his ivory white skin, glistening with sweat from the long battle. He glanced back at the university, silhouetted against the vast kingdom beyond it. The kingdom Alec was sworn to protect. The oath all Magi took upon graduation had bound him to this duty for over a crownspan now. He looked past the creature, at the once beautiful town now reduced to rubble and scorched earth. Purpose swelled in the Magi; he could not allow this beast to progress any farther into the kingdom. \r  \n\"My *direct* spells have no effect on this creature.\" Alec corrected himself from earlier, smirking. The solution for success had come to him, as it always does for the tenure master of Strategics. The path to defeating his opponent clearing in his mind. \r  \n\r  \nThe clairvoyance brought Alec the confidence he needed as his amulet began heating up. Alec grasped his serpentine stave with his fists tightly woven in fully charged enigma-hide, enhancing the strength of the spell he was prepared to cast. Enigma spewed out from the oddly shaped gem and coalesced into a cool blanket embracing his entire body like an icy vise. Then the enigma ignited.\r  \n\r  \nKaiden and the rest of the onlookers gasped in awe at the baffling sight. Staggering backwards from the sheer force of the explosion, hands desperately reaching to block out the light from their eyes so they could behold the spectacle. When their eyes readjusted, there was static in the air, Alec now stood at the same height as the beast before him. Encased in a magical carapace of his own. Kaiden felt his stomach drop as he realized what the magi had done. The only thing capable of such power. It wasn\u2019t an \u201cexplosion\u201d, it was an \u201cimplosion\u201d. His uncle had used his soulstone to empower himself. He would never be able to use magic ever again after this battle.\r  \n\r  \nAlec knew he couldn\u2019t damage the beast with direct spells, so he instead empowered his entire body to a power level well beyond that of the creature\u2019s. Personally trained by his father, the Magi excelled in hand-to-hand combat. He excitedly cracked his knuckles, the power was overwhelming.\n\nThe Daemon was still recovering from the blinding flash of light as Alec launched himself towards him like a rocket. Their fists collided with a deafening bang turning the cliffside into a fiery crucible. The Wizard\u2019s merely hide wrapped flimsy fists from before were now powerful gauntlets that shattered the beast\u2019s carapace with every thunderous blow. The Daemon was no match for the empowered Magi. It was a slaughter. Kaeden and the rest of the students watched in disbelief as the daemon was ripped to shreds in a matter of seconds. The power of the soulstone changing what was almost Judgement Day for the kingdom into a brutal reminder of the power that the Magi wielded. \r  \n\r\n\n\u201cYou are a fool.\u201d The Daemon managed to wheeze, the words whistling out because of his decimated lungs. The wizard responded with an inquisitive singular eyebrow raise, shocked at the defeated beast\u2019s brazen response. \u201cYou\u2019ve wasted your power before the real fight.\u201d Blood spittled from its mouth as it mockingly laughed its final, dying words. \u201cI hope you\u2019ve trained your students well, wizard.\u201d\n\n\\-----\n\nThank you for reading, this is my first writing prompt and it was fun. My wife thinks its good so I'm going to post it! Any criticism I could get is appreciated.",

However, the bullet seemed to disperse into nothingness right before it hit him. I sighed. \"I knew I should've practiced at least a little bit of martial arts,\" I whispered to myself. Who knew that there'd conveniently be someone that can stop magic? \n\nWhile thinking, I shot a dozen earth bullets at this mysterious magic blocker. However, unlike the first bullet I shot at him, there were tiny casting circles appearing in front of him, blocking the bullets before disappearing quickly and the bullets dispersed into nothingness.\n\nI thought to myself, this discovery gave me an idea, however, I need to confirm it. Maybe I should use a stronger spell? Maybe I sh-\n\nBefore I realized, the blocker had rushed towards me. Instinctually, I blocked his fist, however, it pushed me back quite a bit. Without the time to think, he rushed towards me again. I quickly raised a stone wall before he got to me, but the wall crumbled. His fist broke through the wall and the parts surrounding it disappeared into nothing like before.\n\nWith my defense breached, he threw his fist toward my stomach. Before I could fathom what happened, I coughed out blood. Without sparing even a bit of time for me to prepare, I was launched to my right after he had kicked me. \n\nI was slowly losing consciousness, his continuous attacks hadn't given me room to breathe. Laying on the ground, I saw him slowly approaching me. \n\n\"You should've given up. Your stubbornness is what led you to this outcome. I would've let you live had you left earlier. It's too late for regrets now.\" He looked into my eyes, pitying me. \"You can't even grasp the basics of magic, and yet you thought you could defeat me?\"\n\nMustering all of my strength, I sat back up, unable to feel my legs. I tried to speak, but I couldn't even gather the breath to do so. Knowing that I had no other options, I simply gathered all my magic into one Stone Spear.\n\nThe blocker looked at me in surprise, but he didn't show any fear. He wasn't scared. All of my power, all of my strength, couldn't even faze this man. Unlike the casting circles I had seen before, he used a casting circle so mesmerizing, even near death, I couldn't help but smile at what I was seeing. Before I shot out the stone spear, it disappeared into dust. I looked straight into his eyes, he was confused. Before he found out what had happened, a stone spike had pierced through his back.\n\nI could see the light fading away from his eyes as he continued to stare into my eyes as well. I laughed with the last of my breath. It's such a shame I won't be able to see that casting circle again, though. With my consciousness fading away, I slowly closed my eyes. I had defeated the man that no mage could.",

If you counter that, the area will drop a few degrees. Magic is tricky.\n\nIf you want to push an object, you need to create vectors towards the direction you want the object to be pushed. If you counter that, the object will end up slightly going to the opposite direction, because once again, magic is tricky.\n\nBut fighting this guy is trickier.\n\nI\\`ve been at it agains this so called \"Blocker\" for close to half an hour, and my magical energy was starting to run low.

He was slowly losing the edge regarding countering my spells. Not that he was failing, quite the opposite. He was over countering. The area i tried to flood was getting arid, the place i shoot a fireball was covered in slight frost.\n\nI could probably beat him if i managed to outlast his magical power, the problem was that he had a way bigger pool than mine, so i needed to use that, but how?\n\nThe thoughts ran through my head at a hundred times the normal speed, when the answer suddenly hit me.\n\nA simple spell, used many a times by freshman in the magic academy to help with their studies.\n\nI take a deep breath, and cast a barrage of attack spells in his direction, waiting for them to be countered, waiting for him to get at least slightly overwhelmed by the cheer number of cantrips, just so i can mix my hail mary inbetween them.\n\nAfter the fourth or fifth time he negates my barrage, i throw it, and just as expected, he over counters it, and i stop.\n\nYou could hear a pin drop, as both of us simply stare at eachother, until his eyes start to lose focus, and he drops to his knees, stating that i managed to do what i had hoped.\n\nCheers erupt from the spectators, as the unlikely victor from the duel was me.\n\nWho would imagine, that a spell like \"quicken thought\" could be used in such a manner.",

I feel the hatred that possesses every weakling when their betters inflict cruel whim upon them. It\u2019s been so long, but I have not forgotten. For a moment I forget myself, reduced to a flailing animal. Instinctively, I claw at his face, but he\u2019s bigger than me\u2013I can\u2019t reach. He takes clumps of my hair in each hand and pulls, and I scream as he rips them free, leaving bloody patches on my scalp.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re not even a real magician,\u2019 he sneers. \u2018You just got lucky.\u2019\n\nI wish there was time to say something clever. I wish I had the focus to think of it. I wish I could pin him down and make him watch as I eviscerate his family before his eyes. I wish I could make him beg.\n\nBut there\u2019s no time for that. Right now I just need to be thankful for three things: One, that he ambushed me here, at the aerial entrance of my tower. Two, that he\u2019s the type to draw out an enemy\u2019s end, and three, that he clearly didn\u2019t notice why I was already on the ground when he pounced on me.\n\nAs he shakes off the bloodstained handfuls of hair, I reach down and disengage my prosthesis with my right hand. Under my clothes, only the top half of me is still human. The rest\u2013the part he chose to sit on\u2013is just mannequin and padding that I puppet about with my powers. I suppose I should be thankful for the last person who tried to kill me, too. Who knew getting bisected had such situational benefits?\n\nI can barely see through the hair and blood in my eyes, but then, we are in my house.

I\u2019m blinded, powerless, somewhat more (or less, depending on how you see it) than a double amputee, and falling to my death to boot.

He\u2019s coming after me\u2013leaping whole flights of stairs by the speed of it.\n\nOne burst of telekinesis gets my face clean. The second destroys the lowest nine floors.\n\nAs I fly off to the city in the east, I fancy I can hear an anguished scream amidst the sounds of crashing stone.",

I have seen every creature from the dawn of time. or so I thought...\n\nit was months, maybe years I felt him tailing me. im not sure how i knew, but i just knew there was someone always there. Just three seconds behind. Always the door opening as you leave the room. we had never actually confronted. We had never actually met, Until he  finally caught up to me. \n\n  \nIt was a lonely place, an open desolate world. thermically active. there was life, but nothing special. I will never be sure how I came to be at this exact place, my eons of travel and studies have finally begun to blur. But my catalogue will be complete! it was almost night when we finally met. the clouds overhead spoke of rain to come.\n\nA simple being, no taller then myself. his face was an amorphous conglomeration. the pieces didn't fit. was that a mouth or an eye? why were there seven of them? how had I never seen something like this before?! \n\nI didn't stop to ask, I pulled out my wand of fireballs. \"Ignatio\" The  trigger-word caused it to jump in my hand. Knowing that would be enough, I was ready to study the remains, collect my information, And be on my way. this realm was boring anyway. no truly sentient beings here.\n\nThe cloud of smoke poured away from the now tindering crater. no more then 50 feet away, i surveyed the damage. He still stood there. something told me he, it, was smiling. whatever it was doing, sent shivers down my back. I think its laughing at me. \"Ignato, Ignato, Ignato\" \n\n\"IGNATO\" and with that, the wand was useless for a time. the last shot pulled more energy from me then I was prepared for. But it will be worth it.\n\nThat sound again. Louder now. It was most definitely laughing at me. this injustice cannot stand. I will add this one to my collection. pulling from one of my multi dimensional bags, a pair lightning potions. the first was clearly lightning in the bottle. Bouncing and rebounding from side to side, a flash with every impact. The second was just as large, but a was giving off a gold glow.\n\nWith no hesitation, and not worrying about the side effects, I quickly drank the lightning in the bottle, and threw the other golden jar as hard as I could. landing mere inches in front of this figure, I couldn't help but give myself an inner cheer. \"Thundrus!\" I yelled, as loud as the rolling thunder on the summer plains. After less then a third of a breath, the pool glowing in front of this being started to ripple.\n\nHuge bolts blasted from the ground the whole pool erupted into blinding light. My hands waved incantations, as I directed yet more from my hands. My chanting sounded of an avalanche, emanating from everywhere, and consuming everything. \n\nThe pillar of light blocked my view of this being, but I had no fear. they would be consumed by the raw power of nature. the skies themselves opened up to add to my  fury, the rain started to pattern down fully. My echoing continued until finally I had given more then I knew I should. but again \"THUNDRUS\" the bolts channeled towards them with renewed intensity.  covering the few last remaining steps to the creature instantly.\n\nBut they were not? They were being channeled around?\n\n Away? \n\nWhat? \n\na sphere of influence, protected it. My elemental rage had not even touched it! It was then I heard it. Over the now tumultuous rain. Over my chanting. Over the crashing thunder of my voice. That slow feeling being ripped up my spine. He was still laughing! enraged I threw the last of my spell at this being. I could feel the tips of my fingers, burning away. Giving my very body to destroy this creature. I will have my answers! With a sudden clenched fist, it appeared as if every bolt I had used in the last few moments came crashing back again. Barreling down from the sky, thousands of bolts in the breath of an instant.\n\nWinded, I couldn't help but be breathing heavy. All of my fingers were missing at least one knuckles worth of finger. Several on both hands were just gone. At least the wounds are not bleeding I will have to remember to take a healing potion soon, very soon. Staring off into the distance, my eyes once again becoming accustomed to the low light, looking for the remains of this being. there is no way he could have with stood that final assault.\n\nFinally as my vision started to return, with no hesitation, I pulled that healing potion from my belt, two quick slugs of that sweet fetid taste, and I could feel my body warm. my hands stopped throbbing, but regrowing a few falanges is never quick. a few hours maybe. but I don't have that kind of time.\n\n There was a new sound now. Foot steps getting closer. He was still moving. It was getting closer!\n\nagain into my bags, my hands dove deep. Almost to the shoulder, I was looking deep. finally my finger stubs touched on what I was looking for. A small pouch of pellets, not a second after my fingers nubs had it secured firmly in my palm, I was it hurling the first one at this demon creature.\n\n\"Sedimentase!\" the trigger word turned that pellet into a massive boulder. It still had all the forward momentum, 40 full grown men couldn't stand around the perimeter of this. Impressively a massive piece of stone. \n\nafter the resounding crash the first time, I sent several more leaving the last two highly polished pellets in my palm. To just bury this creature and give myself time to escape would be enough. I can run to the ends of time.\n\nAs I back pedaled away from the cloud of dust obscuring the now twilghted skies, the moons were rising in the distance. the rain was making my travel slow, I did not want to fall and lose sight of it. him, that thing. whatever it was. chambering the two reaming stones between my blackened and scorched palms I felt warmth again. These stones were red hot when I threw them, leaving a new pair of scorches on the palms of my hands.\n\n\"Mountoinum\" My voice felt like I pulled from the thunder jar again. A bellowing ricochet of sound and pressure escaped my throat. As well as bright red blood with the last syllable. coughing and wiping my face I turned and ran away from the sunset as fast as the dark would let me. I knew what going to happen, but I was not prepared.\n\nA pair of volcanoes erupted from earth beneath us. Between us. I guess I did not throw them far enough. I ran as the ground beneath be started to tilt. I ran as the air behind me started to vibrate. I ran as if my life depended on it. it did. The rotten smell that came bubbling up hit me before the magma was in sight. the yellow smoke that puffed from the ground, as my feet missed the ever growing cracks.\n\nIt stopped. Everything. I could not help but notice the foul smell was gone first, the blood pounding in my ears left me unable to hear that laughing. I had been running flat out for longer then I could ever remember, my body was exhausted. I had to stop. When I finally turned around. I saw nothing. Not the two new volcanoes, No spewing streams of hot metal.\n\nNothing else could explain it other my spell had been undone! He was there. A mere ten steps ahead of me. contemplating it, I reached to my belt and took all four of my remaining health and vigor potions. holding them awkwardly, and using my teeth to open them, I drank them as stoically as I could. One right after another as he continued to march towards me. \n\nFeeling that warming grow in my stomach. a new sense of energy and vitality. As if I had just woken up from a full cycles rest.  I felt my hands and what was left of my fingers start to tingle and vibrate, this will be enough to get me whole again, I knew it would be. Damn the potion sickness! I'm going to kill this thing! \n\nMoving ever closer I watched as it stepped withing 4 paces. My body grew cold. I did not have that energy anymore. How? It nullified the potions after I drank them? How could it do that?! looking down at my hands I had my thumbs and my index fingers. All my others were  just stumps. The potions were working! I had started the regrowth process on all of them! A few had bones starting to build the structure!\n\nAs close as it now was, I had no choice. Reaching to my other side, using what little feeling with my hand I had, I pulled my last option. several sharp retorts, and a bright flash in the dark left us both stunned. He was no longer laughing.\n\n\"GUN\" I yelled as he finally dropped dead to the ground with no resistance.",

            "comment": "Rogar, as he had come to be called, had learned much through his interactions with the fae. Never give them your name, being the biggest one, or else you'll end up stuck with whatever one is given in replacement. Learning their magics came quickly, as most things did, but there were still so many that were so routinely broken that it was a tenuous grip at best.\n\nStill, by staying grounded in reality, it is easy enough to find solid footing, and see where the journey can take you. \n\nMaybe, just maybe, one of these strange, winding, incomprehensible paths might one day lead him back to the secret door in the back of the bar. Maybe it might even lead him back to the very moment he left Earth, or maybe the passage of time will have left him behind.\n\nMore horrifyingly, the fact that Rogar's old identity could have been stolen along with his name never left the back of his mind. As he imagined the scenarios of stumbling into Jeff's dank, dirty apartment, Roquelle's florist shop, or Kerry's favorite hang-out spot at the park, the scenarios turned dark. In each place, he was met only with blank stares, ridicule, or hostility by former friends.\n\nThough a new thought arose in his mind. Perhaps the thief who stole his name also took his place, and his friends didn't know there was an imposter.\n\nThe horrible thoughts that led his mind astray carried his feet even further from their path. Rogar had forgotten that intention had far more power than direction in such a realm.\nHe found himself far from the strange Fae woods and in more of a mundane looking little cul-de-sac, full of tightly packed town houses and surprisingly familiar things. Automobiles, scooters, even a motorcycle all tucked away from the sidewalk in their respective shelters, but strangely not locked up, as if the residents had nothing to fear.\n\nBut, there was one man loitering by a lamp post, staring at a phone, that made Rogar uncomfortable. He looked like some form of technician, wearing khakis, a dark green shirt, with a simple little belt and bag. He looked innocent enough, but something about this man just seemed disconcerting. There was a primal feeling in Rogar's gut that this man was important, somehow, but the strange indignation that welled up in his chest let him know that a conflict was soon to occur.\n\nNonetheless, he marched out of scraggly trees lining the side of the road, and advanced towards the buildings.\n\n\"Oh, good, you've arrived,\" The man called out before Rogar could even speak.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Rogar called back, picking up the pace.\n\n\"I am Roger,\" The man called, \"And I have been sent here for you.\"\n\n\"To get me out of this place?\"\n\n\"No, to give it to you!\"\n\nRogar couldn't understand the meaning behind those words, no matter how deep he looked into them. Like all things in this place, there were layers of meaning obfuscating the tenuous truth, yet, with all his practice in seeing through it, there were just too many interpretations.\n\nRogar stopped before Roger; the men stood twenty paces apart, looking at each other with a strange, mirrored concern. Roger had the distinct look of a man who didn't fully understand, or like, something that he was witnessing; Rogar, however, stared in disbelief. There was something so familiar about the man across from him.\n\nFinally, Rogar spoke; \"What do you mean, give this place to me? A house, the neighborhood, the whole realm?\"\n\n\"The neighborhood,\" Roger explained, \"It's all set up, just the way you like it. Do you not recognize the homes, here? Different places, brought together, no further need to travel the length of the city!\"\n\nA gift was never a gift, Rogar thought, grimacing and bracing for what was to come.\n\"If this is supposed to be my new home, it is too good for me. I could not accept such a thing. All I deserve is the old, not the new.\"\n\n\"Very true, but you see, trades must have something to offer both sides of the agreement.\"\n\n\"What?\" Rogar interjected, already fearing what was to come.\n\n\"Here, you live in the country, with all of the people you wished to not leave behind, yes? While I get to enjoy the stability and sanity of the mortal realms, here, you will not want for a thing, and your struggles will be over. All is fixed.\"\n\n\"This is not something I want,\" Rogar explained. \"I want to go home.\"\n\n\"This is Rogar's home now. Roger lives amongst the men.\"\n\n\"That was my name, once,\" Rogar exclaimed, \"Give it back!\"\n\n\"I cannot allow that trade.\"\n\n\"I am going home,\" Rogar insisted, and raised his hand with intent, \"As are you.\"\n\nThe thoughts of banishment and expulsion filled Rogar's mind, and he felt the fae power flow through the land and into his body. As quickly as they entered, they left his fingertips, flying to Roger's chest.\n\nA brief flash of light, and Roger still stood, shaking his head and putting away the phone. \"It is as I say. I am of the mundane now. Magic has no power here... But, I don't have to be.\"\n\nWith a snap of the fingers, Roger protruded a sudden force of energy that knocked Rogar flat on his back. As hard as the concrete should've been, his skull was still intact, and his scalp was not bleeding.\n\n\"Soon, I will leave you to this place,\" Roger informed him as Rogar rose to his feet, \"but I would rather see you behold my perfect handiwork just one last time before I go.\"\n\nRogar's mind flashed with brilliance. \"I would like to see my home first,\" He said, barely able to disguise his excitement with a tone of dejection.\n\"Very well,\" Roger said, and turned to lead him into the house.\n\nIt was a perfect copy of Rogar's old townhouse, just as he left it. Keys in a bowl by the door, the pictures on the wall, the exact same rug on the staircase that Kate had picked out when they first moved in together. It had been so long, he had nearly forgotten what his old life looked like. \n\nBut, what he needed was not downstairs. Rogar ran up the steps, taking two at a time, and nearly tripping twice. Roger, perplexed, waited at the bottom of the steps.\n\n\"She is not there. Kate would be at work, right now,\" Roger reminded him, \"But that is not what I am looking for,\" Rogar retorted, as he flung the bedroom door open. He nearly bounced off the wall, rushing around the corner of the bed to get to Kate's nightstand. He flung it open triumphantly.\n\nKate's late nights at work, her fears of robbery, and a good, old-fashioned country interest in guns was Rogar - No, Rodger's - ticket back to his old life. He snatched the revolver and whirled around for the door, to find Roger coming up the steps. \"Did you find it, are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I am very satisfied,\" Rogar gloated, \"I'm going home.\"\n\nRoger stopped in the doorway, and looked up in shock. He raised a hand to click his fingers, but he didn't get the chance to lower the nullifying field. The bullet was faster than any hand.\n\nRoger recovered his wallet and ID from the fae imposter who stole his old life, and with it, symbolically claimed his old identity. Satisfied, he marched into the illusion of the very same bar he exited his world from, only to enter it again, right where he left off.\n\nHis ticket stub, a .38 special casing, remained in his end table drawer for years, the greatest trophy he'd ever earned.",

            "comment": "Flames licked the sides of the arena as my elementals slowly slogged toward Torinn Dachydendreon. She remained deep in concentration, a spell fizzing in the air before her trancelike eyes. I hoped she stayed oblivious long enough for the fire to consume her, except I knew better. Nothing had worked to defeat her.\n\nWhen the flaming creatures were within a staff's length, her hands extended forward, electricity crackling between her fingers. Holes the size of dragon's eggs opened in the ground and geysers began to explode into the air, their sparkling water dissipating my elementals instantaneously. Disappointment filled me like a gelatinous ooze, filling my tired limbs with heaviness. The possibility of losing ran through my mind, bringing terror and adrenaline to my veins. I saw myself packing my bags and leaving the tower for good when they laughed me out of it. No. They'd never forgive me for losing to a Dragonborn. \n\nI searched my mind for a spell that could work, something I could do with just the last of my strength. Only one idea came to mind. It was too dangerous. *Far too dangerous.* Was I prepared to possibly sacrifice my own life to win? Was this battle really this important? The sequences ran through my mind. I'd cast the spell and enter her mind. From there, I'd take control and force her to surrender. Or, It'd go all wrong. I'd try to take control and I'd fail to make a connection, being forced into the spaces in-between her consciousness, a prisoner of intangible gray matter. *Nobody escaped that.* It had been described as navigating an infinite maze leading to nowhere for all eternity. \n\nThe archmages said never to cast that spell. Ever. \n\nThe elementals gone, Torinn went back into concentration, working on her next spell as I stood there unprepared. I had to make a decision, or I'd be defeated without even casting. \n\nThe possibilities zinged through my mind like the lightning bolts I'd cast earlier that had been repelled by her shields. Living in eternal nothingness, or accepting the pain of defeat. The choice seemed obvious, but would I be able to live with myself if I didn't take the chance? What if it worked? I could say I was the only one to defeat her. They'd sing my name in the Great Hall. Maybe even name an ale after me. \n\nYes! Magic sizzled through my body as I accepted what I had to do. I began to mouth the words of the spell, the ancient incantation feeling wrong with each utterance. These words had been forbidden for a reason, but that didn't matter anymore. I rushed the spell to completion with anticipation, firing it long before I thought she'd have a chance to respond. So, when it failed to hit her completely, I was shocked. \n\nBefore the spell hit her, she'd deployed some kind of shield, a blue fence that absorbed the energy. With such a powerful spell, I'd have expected the shield to dissipate, but instead magic began to fly all around where the impact was, flying in waves of greens, reds, blues, and yellows. The waves coalesced into a ball of ribbons floating in the air. Torinn looked at it stunned as I was. \n\nThe judges called for a pause in the battle as the spell began to spin out of control. Fireworks spiraled out of the edges, hitting the top of the arena with blasts. Some of the archmages raised their staffs and began to cast anti-magic spells to control it, but it would not stop until it had run its course. It finished with a small bang, with smoke rising from where it happened. All that was left was... a small rainbow egg. \n\n I knew something was wrong immediately. My fingers felt empty, and my mind more vacant than usual. I couldn't seem to remember any spells. That's when I started to get really scared. Instinctively, I felt like my magic had left me. \n\nTorinn looked at me disapprovingly, then down at the egg. The judges studied it carefully, seeming to know at once what had happened. \n\nAfter a few terse moments, the voice of the head judge boomed over the arena. \"The result of the Mind Control Spell hitting an All-Shield is a Magic Lock that has left one participant silenced and the other participant incapable of winning. Therefore, the result is a tie. However, casting a Mind Control spell is illegal in the arena, and incredibly dangerous. The participant who cast it is immediately disqualified. Not that they will be able to cast spells again.\"\n\nTwo guards escorted me out of the arena and straight to the archmages, who immediately admonished me for being so stupid. They told me that my magical power was now permanently encased in the egg. The worst part is that they took it away so I can't even have the hope of unlocking it. \n\nUntil you came along. \n\nr/StoriesToThinkAbout",

            "comment": "He knows nothing. He feels nothing. He is nothing. Until he is, and all is suddenly green and wet and warm and vital. There is dirt in his mouth and on his limbs, the earth on all sides pressing down on him, insects buzzing deep within, and then a shifting, pulling, the earth lightens and he rises...\n\nAnd the Forest-Revenant of Eternia - sing praise to he of antler and bark, horn and spear, merry and ruthless is his song! - rises once more to confront an intruder.\n\nHow long has it been? His old self would not know anymore. His new self counts times not by the turn of the sun or seasons, but by each new foe that disturbs the forest's sense of harmony. The last time he was, Eternia was cold with snow; the time before that, drenched in the floods of mid-spring. Now Eternia is lush, ripe and verdant with summer. His old self's heart would thrill at the promise of summertime glory and relaxation, sunny days and warm nights spent hunting and ranging, swimming and relaxing. Now, his oaken heart thrills only with the promise of another threat to be dispatched.\n\nHe plucks a seed from under his tongue, and lets it fall to the ground to blossom and unfurl into a mighty bramble-stag. In the next moment he leaps, astride its back in the blink of an eye, and raises his hunting horn to blow a jubilant note of warning: death to you, you who have entered here unwisely!\n\nAnd then he begins to sing.\n\nAnd the hunt is on.\n\nHe leaps streams and gullies, rocks and carcasses. It is not long before he will find his quarry. He is Eternia now, and every animal in the forest is his hunting hound. They are at but the merest inward edge of the forest, barely into the treeline before the Revenant was awoken. He rides onwards, singing and laughing, racing to meet them. His spear is restless, writhing with anticipation of the fight to come. What will they be this time? Marauders, monsters, would-be masters of the woods? The seasons and the armour changes, but they all meet the same end. A small clearing directly in front of him, a figure kneeling at its center - there! He gives a triumphant blast on his horn and directs the stag to give one last leap. The quarry is here!\n\nUnmoved by the sprays of dirt kicked up by the stag's landing - unmoved even by the deep boom of the hunting horn - the quarry stands from its meditation. Looks the Revenant in the face with milky, dead eyes. Gives a rictus grin. Bows.\n\nIts robes are familiar, but not to the Revenant. To who he was, before he was the Revenant. Purple in a spiral weave, trimmed with gold and geometric designs. The quarry...looks familiar, too. Even as a corpse. There is something to the angle of the jaw, the way the grin gives the impression of both humor and nervousness, the way the ears might have stuck out if they weren't reduced to nubs...\n\n\"I guess I was right about my reception committee. It is good to see you again, old friend,\" the Arch-Magister Eternal rasps.\n\nThe Revenant grins back in return, feeling for his spear. \"It is good to see you, old fiend,\" he says with a laugh, \"But you have wandered away from your tomb. Let me guide you back to it.\"\n\nThe Magister rolls his eyes, folds his arms. \"I am not here to fight you, Kenelthian. You don't remember me?\"\n\nA flourish of the spear. Been a while since the quarry talked back to him. They shouted, usually. Or screamed. \"Eternia knows its own. Why should it know you, stranger?\"\n\nA sigh like a death-rattle. \"Not again. Not you too. And they say the path of eternal knowledge leads to memory loss. You really don't remember?\"\n\nThe revenant lunges at where the heart should be - possibly. The old him remembered fighting liches, before: sometimes their anatomy wasn't always where you expected. Strangely, the old part of him is relieved when the Magister casually dismisses it with a wave of his hands and a fractal breeze. \"I do not remember you. But there was an elf who may have known a boy that looked like you.\"\n\nThis time, the sigh is like a resurrected man's first breath. \"Aspiring journeymage?\"\n\nLunge. \"Perhaps\"\n\n\"Joined forces with an aspiring ranger to hunt a jawgaper?\"\n\nFeint. Lunge. \"Possibly.\"\n\n\"Joined that adventuring party with the fighter and the bard? Bertha the Bulwark and the Jolly Roving Fool?\"\n\nFeint. Double feint. Pretend to give up... \"Maybe.\"\n\nAs he lunges, the Magister holds his hand up. The spear goes right through it, but stops right before it can pierce the Magister's skull. A shake of the head. \"Can you give it up already? We've both been dead for centuries, and I've had to do this twice already.\"\n\n\"I'll need my spear back-\"\n\n\"Yes yes, you're the Forest-Revenant of Eternia, eternal spirit of the woods born from sacrifice to defend against all evil and before that you were Kenelthian of the Holly and Rose, and before I was the Arch-Magister Eternal whose soul howls uncoiled from the Cycle in pursuit of the endless unknown I was Apprentice Simon Brisbysboy, and I would like your ghost to remind you we were friends.\"\n\nThat is enough to get him to stand back. Fold his own arms across his bark-plated chest. Think.\n\nThe Magister waits. Pulls the spear out of his hand. Resumes. \"I know you've been busy. I know how it is. Studying the mysteries cosmic and abyssal in your secluded archives and next thing you know it's been nine hundred years, one of your friends became a demigod and another turned themselves into a mythic ballad and your best friend got themselves killed and became a forest. Time changed us all.\"\n\nNow it is the Revenant's turn to sigh. \"So why are you here?\"\n\nThe Magister has never lost his grin, but now it seems even more genuine. \"Because there's something coming that's threatening more than even your forest, and I need your help. We're getting the band back together.\"",

            "comment": "Polori stood a mere twenty feet from Jason. At least, that is what he knew him as, Jason. At some point during the process of becoming a Lich he had decided that \u201cJason\u201d was not nearly as terrifying as his name should be. \n\nSkyddec the Lich Lord. That is what accursed name he chose for himself. When Polori had heard the name he was quite enraged. To learn that his friend became a lich was already deeply troubling for him, but then to learn that he had even changed his name. It was as though his friend whom he had once considered nearly a brother had truly become someone-something-else.\n\n\u201cWhy do you stand here?\u201d The ghastly jaw of Skyddec creaked and roiled as a piercing and breathy voice questioned the ancient elf.\n\nIn a moment, a memory flashed in the aged elf\u2019s mind. One of a forest at sunset. One of laughter, and fun. One of bark after the rain, and the grass too. A memory of two boys, catching frogs by the river. \n\n\u201cJason.\u201d The old elf frowned. \u201cWhy..? Why on earth would you-\u201c Polori began to speak but was cut off quickly by the enraged skeleton.\n\n\u201cThat name! That cursed\u2026\u201d The lich\u2019s mind was pained. Despite having immeasurable power, infinite potential, the evil spirit was brought to submission by a mere name. \u201cThis\u2026 that name means nothing. Jason can not- does not exist.\u201d \n\nPolori sighed and stepped toward Skyddec. Instantly, the Lich shot a black flame out towards the elf in retaliation. The flame dissipated against the elf\u2019s robes, and one of the many rings adorning the boney fingers of the old man shattered and faded away.\n\n\u201cDo you remember where you stand?\u201d Polori asks. The two of them glance around at the decrepit land they found themselves in. \u201cThe bereft land\u2026 you used this place as an example- to prove your power. You destroyed this place, burnt it down to embers using an evil ember. Now all that remains is ash and cinders- and the embers of a man once named *Jason*.\u201d Like an attack on its own, the name shot through Skyddec\u2019s skull and it grabbed its skull with its hand- its functioning one at least.\n\n\u201cBut do you remember!? What this place was?\u201d Polori began to shout as the Lich continued to protect its head. \u201cIt was home! We played here! This is where we brothers. Did you destroy it because it hurt too much to remember? Or did you destroy it because you couldn\u2019t remember but some part of you told you it was significant?\u201d Polori interrogated, now standing over the lich. Despite the lich being a hulking demon, the old elf managed to gain height by the Lich Lord\u2019s cowardly shrinking onto his knees.\n\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Neither spoke. Polori shook his head in disapproval. The man who was once like family had fallen to the evils of necromancy and had done something to himself that was irreparable. Irreparable and foolish.\n\n\u201c\u2026The forest of Eternia\u2026\u201d A decaying voice said. Polori opened his eyes and stared down at Skyddec, who was now speaking. \u201cAll I had known, was that this place\u2026 meant something\u2026 you meant something\u2026 I-\u201c Skyddec was recalling. If it weren\u2019t physically impossible, a well of tears would be formed in his eyes. \u201cYou were immortal\u2026 or nearly. I had known you would outlive me\u2026 do you even know what it\u2019s like? To be friends with someone- brothers- and to *know* that you will die before them- far before them. That your time together will be nothing but a blink! That you mean NOTHING!\u201d Skyddec growled. \n\n\u201cYou NEVER meant nothing to me, Jason!\u201d Polori shouted back. \u201cYou were my brother, damn it all! I had never known such friendship, even if I would\u2019ve outlived you, I would never have forgotten. Do not think for a moment that I do not feel your pain. My longevity is as much of a curse as it is a boon. I have lived centuries. I have fallen in love, had friendships, seen stories- all to be forgotten by time, to be adrift like sparks in the night.\u201d Polori exclaimed, his voice breaking.\nTo age or to emotion could not be known.\n\n\u201cHah\u2026\u201d Skyddec chuckled, grimly. \u201cThat longevity. I wanted\u2026 I wanted to be like you. Save us both the pain of me dying first. I studied ways to live forever, and in my search\u2026 I coveted it. How could I not? It had taken over my life. I suppose the process of lichification had corrupted my mind and justified it.\u201d Speaking much more lucidly and without hatred this time. The ghoul began to reason.\n\n\u201cYou disappeared. All to study immortality. I was content- torn, but content to spend as much as I time with you as I could. All your life, I thought it\u2019d be best for both of us. And then, I would never forget. Have you immortalized in some way. But\u2026 you vanished. And I couldn\u2019t. And to think, you vanished because you wanted to spend more time with me\u2026\u201d Polori chuckled. He began to break out into even more laughter.\n\n\u201cWhen I had heard you became a lich, I was devastated. I was furious. I came here because if anyone was going to kill you, it\u2019d be me- I\u2019d be the one to lay my friend now\u2026 I don\u2019t know why I thought so\u2026 but I thought that killing you would prove that I was a good friend. Freeing you, is what I would call it.\u201d Polori continued. Skyddec got up slowly and put his hand, his skeletal hand, onto Polori\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cIt will\u2026 it will free me. This corpse\u2026 this is not Jason. I am not the man you once knew.\u201d Skyddec said.\n\n\u201cHeh\u2026 I suppose we\u2019ve both gotten too old for this world\u2026 huh? I don\u2019t think I could bear to lose another friend.\u201d Polori cried.\n\n\u201cThen\u2026 we could both\u2026?\u201d Skyddec started. Polori glared at him. \u201cI could do it. Use my power to do something good for once. Both of us, at the same time. We could die together, like we wanted.\u201d \n\n\u201cLike we want.\u201d Polori corrected. Skyddec gave out the closest thing to a smile as he could with his rotting face. He raised his hand, and a black flame began to consume them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame\u2026 I see these woods now for what they are\u2026 I don\u2019t know why I burned them down.\u201d Skyddec noted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure\u2026 it\u2019ll grow back. Sometimes you can mess with the natural order, but you can rarely destroy it.\u201d Polori reassured.\n\n\u201c\u2026I hope we\u2019re still friends in the next one\u2026\u201d They both thought as the fire consumed them.",

            "comment": "\"You do not belong here. This is a living temple.\"\n\nIlleathe addressed the robed clad skeleton before him. The trees around him creaked, branches moving to let through a healthy dose of sunlight. It illuminated the skeleton in a radiant beam, purity burning down.\n\nIt gave a dusty laugh, tipping back its skull as if enjoying the light. It's moss green robes rustled gently in a summoned breeze, pressing against its bony frame. \"Do I really not belong here?\"\n\nIlleathe frowned. The voice was faintly familiar, tickling the back of his mind. But that was unsurprising to him. He had seen many people come and go, travellers in the Forest of Eternia. He called out to the spirits of his home, asking for their strength. They gave it willingly, forming a halo of white power behind his head. \"You do not. Begone.\"\n\nThe halo released three crackling vines of white, bristling with banishing thorns. They arched down to the skeletal lich, plunging into its chest. It spread its arms wide, letting the spiritual power arch through it. Yet instead of being sent back to the material plane, it lingered, the banishment failing.\n\nIt gave another laugh. \"I belive I do. I was given permission to roam here freely.\"\n\nIlleathe's stomach clenched. Who could have given such an abomination of nature that freedom? Who had left their home vulnerable? The hairs on his neck stood up, as he calmed himself to keep his composure. \"Who? Who would dare betray here like that?!\"\n\nThe lich's laugh was grating. \"It was you Illeathe. I'm almost hurt you don't recognise me.\"\n\nThe elf felt the breath leave his lungs, as though he had been struck. How? That wasn't possible. He had only given permission to a handle of people. Good, kind, trustworthy people.\n\nThe lich reached to the neck of its robes, digging around for a worn leather cord. It pulled it out, revealing a twisted root hanging from it. \"This may jog your memory.\"\n\nIlleathe stared at it, shock making his centuries-old facade drop. That root. He had a matching one at home. It had been made with his first human friend. The voice echoed in his head. It was on ehe had heard before. One he hadn't heard in a long time, and never thought he would again. \"T-Torret?\"\n\nThe lich gave a familiar bow, and he could tell it was grinning. \"In the bones, my old friend.\"\n\n\"What... what did you do?\"\n\nTorret held up a hand, looking through the gaps at the sun above. \"What I had to. There wasn't enough time to learn everything I wanted to. So I made time for myself.\"\n\nIlleathe took a step back. \"You... you've become a monster. You kill people.\"\n\nThe lich shrugged. \"They wanted to kill me first. Besides, it's not like I deliberately go out of my way to hurt people.\"\n\nThe elf shook his head. \"But all those villages lost.\"\n\nTorret thought for a moment, before snorting. \"Oh, those. I was humane. I gave most of them quick deaths. I needed research materials.\"\n\nIt's callous words served only to numb Illeathe further. He was hopelessly out of his depth here. He had made it so Torret would not be harmed by the forest, unless it hurt the forest first. He was meant to be one of the protectors, but now it seemed he would be remembered as the key to its destruction. \"Why? Why are you here?\"\n\nThe lich sighed, looking around. \"I wanted to see this place again. That's all. Running into you was a happy coincidence.\"",

            "comment": "Selakiir, the old, wizened elf, struggled to walk with his armor. It was a suit he had not worn for centuries, not since he was still enlisted in the great war. Back then, he was a general in his late 900s. Now he was more than a thousand years old: far above the lifespan of most elves and were circumstances different, he would be at home waiting to die alongside friends and family. Yet here he was once more, in the grove of the old forest where he first met his first great love.\n\nHe remembered as he looked around, these were the very same steps that he took for his pilgrimage a thousand years past. All warriors in his village must undergo this pilgrimage and to offer their blood to the forest. He did not expect to see two human men in the clearing, looking at the Great Tree of Eternity and basking in its light.\n\nOne of them turned to look at Selakiir. It took everything in the elf to not gasp. He was stunning. Beautiful. Sun-kissed skin and eyes shining grey like the sun piercing the clouds. The human smiled, and it made Selakiir turn away as he approached the duo.\n\n\u201cI am Selakiir,\u201d he announced. He read off words in his mind as they were drilled by his sergeant and put his hand towards the sword at his side. \u201cOf the Groveguards. You are trespassing on a holy site of the Eternian elves. I have to ask you two to leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d The handsome one said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. We were just lost. We were here hunting for mushrooms and we found ourselves here in this clearing and at this\u201d he pointed towards the Great Tree. \u201cstunning tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most sacred sites of elvenkind,\u201d Selakiir said. He looked up at the tree and continued: \u201cand that is the Great Tree of Eternity. It was the first tree to sprout in the forest of Eternia and the site where the first elves made contract with the fae.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d The other human asked. This one was larger than the first, and not blessed with the same stunning beauty. \u201cWe deeply apologize. Me and my brother did not mean any offense.\u201d\n\nThe mention of the two being brothers gave him a small sense of relief that he would not like to acknowledge. \u201cThat is fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI will guide you to the main road. If you would follow me, please.\u201d With a wave of his hand, he led them out of the sacred clearing and back into human territory through roads and markers he has been trained to memorize and know for over 100 years. He could hear whispers from the two behind him. \u201cI told you we shouldn\u2019t have gone this far into the forest,\u201d the plain one said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the handsome one whispered back. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him a little bit.\u201d Selakiir could hear the handsome one\u2019s footsteps behind him. His heart beat faster.\n\n\u201cWe apologize deeply,\u201d he said. \u201cWe mean no offense. We are only two fools who got lost looking for mushrooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Selakiir said. \u201cHumans wander here all the time. The paths are not well-marked and we do not share its secrets with the humans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a shame,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful tree. What a shame to not let it be seen by human eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Selakiir agreed. \u201cMaybe with time it might change.\u201d\n\nThe handsome one smiled. \u201cMy name is Munib,\u201d he said. \u201cThat there is my brother, Satam. It is good to meet you, Ser Selakiir.\u201d\nSelakiir could feel his face flush being so close to Munib. \u201cLikewise.\u201d\n\nEventually they came by a human road. \u201cDo you recognize this place?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Satam said. \u201cThank you very much, Ser Elf.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your leniency,\u201d Munib said. With that the two started to walk away. In a flash of impulse, Selakiir said \u201cWait!\u201d\nThe two looked back on the elf. Satam with a hint of fear, but Munib kept his head cool with a faint smile. Selakiir gulped and continued. \u201cWhere do you two live?\u201d\n\nMunib smirked and told Selakiir he and Satam\u2019s village. \u201cVisit us when you can,\u201d he said.\n\n***\n\nSelakiir was always told by his family to never take a human lover. \u201cThey live such short lives,\u201d they said. \u201cThey\u2019ll never grow old with you. They\u2019ll fade away like nothing.\u201d\n\nThese thoughts plagued him even as Munib lay his head on his chest. He looked at the two rings on the bedside and played with the human\u2019s hair. He sighed. This was his best friend, his lover, his husband. Every time they kissed, every time they made love, every time they held each other in cold, lonely nights, a voice in his head told him this one will die before your age hits the 400s.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much,\u201d Munib has said. \u201cJust enjoy the moment while it lasts.\u201d Easy for him to say! He was not the one who would suffer the loss. Munib would die beloved, yet Selakiir would live for a few more hundred years carrying this grief.\n\nSometimes Munib would catch Selakiir crying when he thought he was alone. Munib would never interrupt him. He merely turned the other way and resolved himself for what he has to do.\n\n***\n\nAs time went on, the gears of history turn, and the future envisioned by the three men in the forst became closer to reality. Elves and mankind got closer and the secrets of the forest were slowly revealed to humankind. Selakiir did his duties, as ambassador of the elven tribe to the country where his husband was from. And through the corner of his eye, he saw a face that looked very familiar, but he was not able to recognize.\n\n\u201cSelakiir!\u201d The familiar face said. \u201cIt has been a long time! You haven\u2019t changed a bit since we met all those years ago.\u201d\nSelakiir approached him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might seem rude, but do I know you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d He said. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Satam! We haven\u2019t met in a couple decades. How is my brother? How\u2019s Munib been?\u201d\nSelakiir looked at Satam. He remembered his face, yes. The beard that was once black and lush was now white and thin. His hair has receded back and his stature had become thin and frail. And one thing finally struck him.\n\n\u201cMunib\u2019s fine,\u201d Selakiir said. \u201cMunib is doing great, actually.\u201d\n\nWith that, he hurried back to his village. He told his staff to take care of things in his absence but there was an important issue he had to deal with at home. He rode to his home and into his lover\u2019s room and saw him on his writing desk, puzzling over a letter.\n\u201cYou\u2019re home early,\u201d Munib said. \u201cDid something happen.\u201d\n\nIt was only then did Selakiir realize that this human did not age like other humans. How long has it been since they first met? Around fifty years or so and he has barely aged. No new white hair or wrinkle in sight. No crow\u2019s feet or crooked back or weakness in the fifty years they\u2019ve been together. His brother has aged normally, but him\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Selakiir asked.\n\nMunib\u2019s smile dropped. \u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like you figured it out.\u201d\n\nWithout warning Munib shot a blast of dark energy from his palm and knocked Selakiir to the wall. As he yowled in pain, Munib ran away out the house. It took a few seconds for Selakiir to regain his balance. A few of his bones are broken, but with some swift magic, he was able to numb the pain. Thankfully, none of the broken bones were on his legs, but he still felt it in his ribs and arms when he ran after Munib into the forest.\n\nSelakiir finally caught up to Munib waiting for him in a cave filled with bones and blood. A stone altar stained red and brown sat in the center of the cave with piles of skulls and candles on it. Behind the altar stood his own husband, knife in one hand and a staff in the other.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Selakiir said. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\n\n\u201cI found immortality,\u201d Munib said. \u201cI found a way to be with you forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough the dark arts?\u201d Selakiir said. He looked at the piles of bodies scattered around. The bones, the bits of flesh, the iron smell of blood that filled the cave and made him woozy. \u201cHow many lives did you sacrifice for\u2026 for this?\u201d\n\nHe did not answer.\n\nSelakiir found his eyes hot with tears as he drew his sword out towards his husband. \u201cAbomination,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not suffer you to live.\u201d\n\nMunib looked at Selakiir with a pained expression. \u201cI knew you would say that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe man I fell in love with would not say otherwise.\u201d\n\nWith a wave of Munib\u2019s hand, skeletal hands rose from the ground and grabbed Selakiir\u2019s limbs. He watched as Munib waved him boodbye and walked slowly to the far side of the cave. \u201cWait!\u201d Selakiir yelled. \u201cCome back! Don\u2019t you run away!\u201d\n\n***\n\nA thousand years has passed since then. The Great Lich has waged a long and colossal war against the many races of the world. History has since been built since then. Humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and many others have banded together against the undead hordes. It seems silly, to those who have lived now that there was a time, before the Great Lich, that the races waged war against each other for silly things like land and borders.\n\nNow Selakiir wore his old armor, the one he wore when he was still a fighter in that war. The same holy sword, blessed by the twelve gods worshipped by all races. Too heavy to wear now, but felt just right. He was in the same clearing that he first met his great love, and just like back then, he was looking up at the Great Tree of Eternity.\n\nSelakiir threw down a letter. \u201cYou wrote this.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d Munib asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten your handwriting,\u201d Selakiir said. \u201cI\u2019ve kept all the notes you\u2019ve left behind around the house.\u201d How could he have thrown them away? It hurt too much.\n\nMunib looked back, first at the letter, \u201cI will be at the place we first met\u201d, then at Selakiir.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve aged,\u201d Munib said. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed so much. But I know it\u2019s you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t changed a bit,\u201d Selakiir said. The beauty that first enraptured him was still there. He still radiated. There was no way a heart could forget him. \u201cWhy did you call me?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy love,\u201d Munib said. \u201cEternity has been so stifling. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve been alone all this time and I just want it to end.\u201d He took off his wedding ring and tossed it at Selakiir\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where my soul is,\u201d Munib said. \u201cCrush it and you can end it right now.\u201d\n\n(Continued in reply)",

            "comment": "The moonlight washed over the branches of the old oak tree as the skeletal mage knelt before it. The skeleton appeared to be fumbling with a mass of leather strips and chains. Unnoticed by the undead being, a small cadre of elves stood silently in the branches of the tree, awaiting the signal to destroy the being.   \n\n\nOne of the elves, an old ranger named Laverian, dropped near soundlessly out of the tree. The skull pivoted immediately, and the elf saw the crusted gemstones embedded deep into the skull. This was no mere animate undead. This was a lich, aware, awake, and still with its full mental capabilities. The elf drew back his bow and pointed an arrow at the undead.   \n\n\n\"What? No greetings? Not even a threat?\" The dry rasping voice seemed to be carried on the wind itself, carrying evenly to all of the elves. Even more strangely, the voice was elvish, though the accent was not quite right. \"I know what the tree means to you. I do not come to destroy or kill. I seek no power, or hidden knowledge. I have heard that I am late to a funeral, and I came to hang a memento in the tree's branches.\" The lich extended its arms, and the chains and leather were taking shape into a dreamcatcher of mithral, gemstones, and fine basilisk leather. \n\n\"Who's funeral have you missed, abomination?\" The elf spoke quietly, keeping his bow trained on the powerful magically enchanted undead. \"None of your kind have died here in years. The Eanir Forest is proof against the undead in all its forms.\" \n\n\"My kind? I am rather unique. IF you mean the foolish animate immortals easily banished by light and alder stakes, then yes, the forest is protected. As for the rest of the mindless undead, they are kept away by another source. The funeral I missed was that of an elven scholar and friend. I last saw him over a thousand years ago. His name was Haldani. Known by many as the knot-twister, he was one of the finest minds I have ever known. This is a poor attempt to recreate one of his works. No magic, no artifice. Just counterweights and good craftsmanship.\" The lich stretched out his skeletal fingers. \"I may have given too much of my dexterity away with my flesh. What a pity.\"  \n\n\nThe lich looked up at Laverian. \"Will you accept this on behalf of Haldani's family? His son, Laverian was a talented ranger, and he and I traveled together while I still had flesh. After we killed a red wyrm together, he returned here, and I began to study some of the texts I found there.\" The lich extended the dreamcatcher, now assembled into a brilliant sphere of interlaced mithral chain and shining basilisk leather, with inscryptions in elvish running throughout it, inlaid in precious gems. \n\nThe ranger lowered his bow and lowered his killing veil.  \"Hurly? Is that you? I thought you'd died a millenia ago. How is this possible? Father died ten years ago. Did you just hear of it? He died destroying the Scourge.\"\n\nA dry echoing chuckle resounded through the clearing. \"You weren't wrong, Lav. I did die. I have died. Repeatedly. And no, I did not just learn of your father's death. I was there. He and I combined to break the Scourge. The magic broke both of us to ash. My seventh death. Your father's only.\" The lich looked up, and one of his fingers twitched, and an arrow stopped mid-flight inches from his skull. \"Your men are restless. I have not come to cause harm. I have come to offer my condolences for the death of a legend.\"",

            "comment": "The forest was quiet the day they first met in that clearing halfway between the elven village and the human town. That human town is gone, abandoned to rotted away into mulch after a plauge struck many of people there. That place is a different type of quiet, not a peaceful one, but a anxious one; the type of quiet that is created when something terrible has, or is going to, happen. The same type of quiet that has befallen the forest clearing.\n\nIt was early spring when they first met, two children lost in the woods while playing games. Andal had seen a bird and hunted it down as to take a single feather, or at least that what she claimed all those years ago. Alex, meanwhile, had been playing hide and seek with some cousins when he had gotten turned around and lost. When the two met, there was no distrust of the other, no awkward stares or anything of the sort, they had just introduced each other and talked. Sure, there were many things that they didn't understand, but only in innocent ways, the ways which children are ignorant of the world.\n\nThat was the first time they met. The second time was when Alex' older sister had brought him to the elven village to beg for aid in saving people from the plauge. A cry for help that the elves ignored, stating that it is the way of mortals to die of natural, and interfering with the natural order to save a few people is out of the question for them. Andal had snuck out as the sibling left and cried at the fate her human friend' friends were suffering.\n\nThe three of them cried for hours.\n\nToo soon, Andal handed Alex a spell book that could help to heal the ill, and told him that if he practiced the spell then he should be able to save some of his people.\n\nShe was wrong. Alex was only able to save himself, as he had no-one to train him in the art of spellcraft. He did learn to master the art, but not in time.\n\nHe left the region soon after, taken to an orphanage by the guards of the next town over. He kept training in the magical arts, as to better help those in future. But even with this in mind, he could never get rid of the thought that the elves had abandoned everyone he cared for to die.\n\nAs he grew, so did the power he wielded and the hatred in his heart. He eventually left the kingdom entirely, wandering into the wastes in search of \"something\". He never came back, and everyone assumed him dead.\n\nAnd yet, the sight of the hooded form of an animated skeleton was undoubtedly the same person Andal had befriended so many years ago. She would have been happy, if it weren't for the fact that Alex had come from the elven village, which had been set ablaze and encased in a magical bubble.\n\nThe two people stared at each other for a moment before Alex silently offered her a spell book, one she recognised as the one she had gave him. she stared at it for a moment before taking it as she asked, \"You do know that I must kill you for this, right?\"\n\nAlex let out a cheerless chuckle before admitting, \"I would be an idiot if I didn't, but you must know that I will try and stop you from doing so.\"\n\nThe two stared at each other for another moment, savouring the last of the quiet around them.\n\nAnd then they charged at the other.",

            "comment": "Humans tend to think the undead don\u2019t feel like the living do. At least, they imagine, our sensations must be numbed, our emotions run to coldness\u2013they can\u2019t conceive of bone and desiccated flesh providing the same intensity of perception their fragile mortal organs do.\n\nThey\u2019re half right about that last part. Of course dead things can\u2019t feel the way their living counterparts do. That\u2019s just part of being dead. What humans forget is that even the lowliest skeleton-at-arms is a magical creature. The fundamental trick of undeath is to mimic past life with that magic, to set spiritual channels formerly filled by positive energy aflow with the negative kind. If those bones can move as though muscles and sinew still bound them, why should they not feel as though nerves and skin still surrounded them? This is why it is quicker and easier to raise a skeleton than to animate the model of one with the golem-arts. Where the necromancer only has to reach for the echo of what was once there, the artificer must compose an entirely original schema of movement and sensation, a complete alien mentality yet encompassed by their own mind. A lich can train itself not to flinch at pain, and more easily than a man, but only the grand effigy-adepts can make themselves bodies untouched by such unpleasantness.\n\nAll this is to say that the trowel nicking my skull hurts as badly as if it had sliced through the scalp I last wore a millennium ago. I curse, voice stifled by the dirt all around me, and receive in return an equally muffled cry of surprise from above. The metal edge quickly scrapes away more soil, a tad more gently this time, until my right eye-socket finds itself staring into a young elven face. Bearing in mind that elves mature similarly to humans for the first decade or so, she might be ten or eleven. She disappears just as I manage to get a good look at her, and I hear the patter of feet as she runs off, calling into the distance.\n\n\u2018Master! Master! The Dread One is here! Under the tree!\u2019\n\nI don\u2019t have to wait long before a more familiar figure strides into view, the little one trailing behind him.\n\n\u2018Do get me out of here,\u2019 I say. With no better route, the sound rattles up through my exposed eye-socket. It\u2019s an interesting sensation.\n\n\u2018Nice to see you too,\u2019 replies my old friend. He crouches down, and the earth flows around his calloused hands like water as he scoops my skull up. \u2018Any more down there?\u2019\n\n\u2018Just this for now,\u2019 I tell him. \u2018New apprentice?\u2019\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t let them tend the Lichgrove if they\u2019re not promising,\u2019 he says, setting me down on one of the tree\u2019s wider buttress roots. He beckons the girl a bit closer. \u2018Her name is Sarca.\u2019\n\nSarca gives me a small wave of greeting. \u2018Sorry I hit your head.\u2019\n\n\u2018Actually, I was just considering winging on over to see if something had happened,\u2019 he says to me, sitting down on another root. \u2018The farmers\u2018 sons are all back from the front, so of course they\u2019re expanding.\u2019\n\n\u2018Slash-and-burn?\u2019\n\n\u2018What else?\u2019 He rolls his eyes disgustedly.\n\n\u2018They do love their fire,\u2019 I agree. \u2018Their temples finally managed to raise up a real holy warrior. Your trees get the mundane flames, I got the heavenly kind. He smote me so hard I think he might have destroyed everyone under my direct control.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sorry to hear that,\u2019 he says. \u2018Should we expect any refugees? I might need to prepare my people.\u2019\n\n\u2018If they\u2019re not already here, most likely not,\u2019 I say. \u2018Unlike me, they don\u2019t have phylacteries conveniently located in friendly territory, and there\u2019s the whole cursed kingdom between here and my lands\u2013former lands, I suppose. Any survivors probably went to ground in the old mountain tunnels.\u2019\n\n\u2018I could bring them a message,\u2019 he offers. \u2018I was about due to go terrorize those farmers when you turned up.\u2019\n\n\u2018It would be good if you could tell them I\u2019m safe and regenerating. Help me take a look at what that hero\u2019s doing to my domain, too. It took me a month just to grow this skull.\u2019\n\n\u2018You\u2019re lucky we check your phylactery periodically.\u2019\n\n\u2018Surely. In any case, I don\u2019t think it will be safe for us to re-emerge while he\u2019s alive. The best-case scenario is that they let him found his own kingdom in the space he just cleared. His descendants will be either be decadent in a generation or two, or at war with the current regime like I was.\u2019\n\n\u2018You think so?\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not a prophet, but I have had a long time to observe them. And unlike you, I actually do care to observe them.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s that little bit of human still left in you,\u2019 he says, getting up. \u2018Well, that and being at war with them for a hundred years, I suppose.\u2019\n\nThen he turns sharply. \u2018Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t see that trowel, Sarca!\u2019\n\nThe girl freezes guiltily in the act of trying to surreptitiously pick up the tool and stuff it into her pocket.\n\n\u2018What day is it today?\u2019 he asks, every inch the imperious master now.\n\n\u2018No-Tools Day,\u2019 she chants dejectedly.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s right. Remember; reach into the soil with your spirit, and it will part more readily than before any tool of bronze.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not bronze, it\u2019s steel,\u2019 she mutters.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s not the point, and you know it! Anyway, it\u2019s time for me to go gut some farmers now. Take care of the Dread One while I\u2019m gone. Do you remember what I said about the regeneration process?\u2019\n\n\u2018Fertilize the ground when it\u2019s done; it takes a lot of nutrients to grow bones,\u2019 she recites.\n\n\u2018Alright. Good. Well remembered. I\u2019ll be back in a week or two, assuming everything goes well.\u2019\n\nHe takes off at a run down the long, crooked forest corridor.

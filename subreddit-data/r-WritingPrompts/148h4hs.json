            "comment": "I clocked in ten minutes late, as usual, but nobody cared. \n\n\u2018The bus was late,\u2019 I offered to nobody in particular. Amal shrugged. Maureen, a selectively mute former veteran, enveloped me in a strangely tender hug. I looked over her shoulder quizzically at Amal. \n\n\u2018Extra cleaning today. Did you hear about Dana?\u2019 She grunted. (Dana was the cleaning lady.)\n\u2018Good news or bad?\u2019 I winked. \u2018Let\u2019s see, I hope Gus proposed and she\u2019s away celebrating, but I\u2019m guessing she just got a stomach bug or something and couldn\u2019t come in.\u2019\nAmal shook her head, turning away and hiding her face beneath her hijab. \n\u2018Covid? Chicken Pox? Early retirement?\u2019 I teased. \n\u2018Gunshot to the head,\u2019 snapped Michael, carrying a tray of freshly baked pastries. \n\u2018Yikes.\u2019 I grimaced. Then added: \u2018poor Dana.\u2019 \nBehind Michael, Maureen wiped away tears. \n\n\u2018I guess you haven\u2019t seen the shopfront?\u2019 Michael asked. \nI shook my head, \u2018I walk down the back alley from the bus stop. It\u2019s not on my route to work.\u2019 \n\u2018Boss wants to interview you for Tina\u2019s job.\u2019 Michael said, ignoring me. \n\u2018Tina\u2019s - what? I don\u2019t want Tina\u2019s job.\u2019 (Tina was the shift manager, good with numbers. Probably the only one of us who worked hard.) \n\u2018What - what happened to Tina?\u2019 I asked, alarmed. \nMaureen shook her head and walked back to the bakery.\nAmal and Michael looked at each other. Amal folded her arms.\n\u2018Gunshot to the head,\u2019 they said in unison. \n\n\u2018Aww, man!\u2019 I was exasperated. \n\nI like this job, I do. Easiest money I\u2019ve ever made. Clock in, clock out. Sell pastries. Customers hardly ever come in, so mostly it\u2019s just hanging out, fooling around, listening to music. Low effort, high pay. Every now and then people come to collect deliveries, never pastries mind you, but I knew better than to ask about it. And sometimes there\u2019d be men in suits holding meetings in the back room, big burly guys who looked like bouncers, muscles with beer bellies. So low effort, high pay, turn a blind eye to the weird bits. \n\nBut this- this was not low effort. Gunshot to the head, that wasn\u2019t part of the deal. You don\u2019t get hazard pay in a bakery. \n\n\u2018Why don\u2019t you go for it, Amal? You\u2019re good at that sort of thing.\u2019 \n\u2018Boss asked you to apply, he says you got a degree in Maths?\u2019 \nShit. I didn\u2019t have a degree in Maths.  My twin sister did. I just doctored hers and applied for a few jobs with that on my CV. I figured nobody would follow up. I didn\u2019t even realise I\u2019d put it on my CV for this gig. \n\nAmal handed me a mop and sponge. Walking into the storefront was like stepping onto a movie set for a Quentin Tarantino film. I didn\u2019t know people bled that much. Or that dried blood could be so bright and vivid. \n\nAt the front of the shop one of the window panes had smashed and was boarded up with a thick piece of cardboard. Blood spatters were everywhere, sprayed across the walls, and deep pools of black blood caked the Lino flooring. \n\n\u2018Surely, we\u2019re not gonna open today?\u2019 I asked. \n\u2018Boss says business as usual. Check to see if they cashed up last night. They closed in usual circumstances.\u2019 \nI nodded, and opened the cash register. It was drenched in what seemed to be decimated brain matter. I spun away and retched into the waste bucket. \n\u2018Looks like they didn\u2019t cash up.\u2019 Said Amal, picking up a slimy, shiny coin from the till. \n\nOn the far left table I found a parcel with the boss\u2019 name on. It was sticky with adhesives that smelled sickly sweet, like almond syrup. Michael picked it up. Suddenly Maureen seized it and threw it quickly through the smashed window. \n\u2018GET DOWN!\u2019 She screamed, shoving Michael and I to the floor. \n\nWe heard a boom outside, then lots of screaming. Pieces of shrapnel shot in through the window, or burst through the cardboard cover. \nMichael cried out in pain. Sticking through his shin was a screwdriver.  \nAmal lay shuddering behind the counter. Screws and forks and metal things sticking out of her face. \n\nI bolted out the storefront into the street. It looked like a war zone. Rubble everywhere. People caked in dust like it was icing sugar. It was some kind of bomb. The letter. A shrapnel bomb. \n\nI tripped, and fell, the headless body of a woman with a pram beside me. I scooped the child out, it seemed to be alive. I ran and ran and ran. \n\nAt some point I ended up at the hospital. Someone had taken the child from my arms and I was cradling a bag of flour instead. \nA doctor shone a small torch in my eyes. \u2018You\u2019re okay physically I think, but you\u2019ve gone into shock.\u2019 \n\nThe department was in total chaos. Gurneys wheeling by, nurses whizzing around, checking pulses, wrapping bandages, triaging patients as they arrived. \n\nSuddenly I felt arms wrapped around me. Maureen. She held me close. I let myself be hugged. She gave me a note. It was from the Boss. It read: interview tomorrow, 9am. Don\u2019t be late. Good luck.",

            "comment": "\"Hey Don, I would greatly appreciate having a talk with you in your office at some point today.\" I knew that simply calling The Don out would end badly for me. I couldn't actually say I even knew, I didn't think. It wouldn't work, but it also wouldn't *impress* The Don. For my plan to work, I had to move very delicately.\n\nMy boss, who insisted I refer to him as \"Don,\" smiled and ushered me into his office.\n\n\"How can I assist you this fine day?\" as he sat down in his leather office chair, behind a massive mahogany desk. Only slightly out of place in a butcher's shop back office, but the boss- The DON, never got his hands dirty, and we did good business. \"Is there a favor you would ask of me?\"\n\n\"I would actually like to offer you a favor.\" I began. \"You may determine what it's worth to you after receiving it. I trust you to be a fair judge of the value of this favor.\"\n\nThe Don sat back a bit in his chair and considered, his eyes narrowing. \"Of what nature is this favor?\" he asked cautiously.\n\nMy simple answer, \"Security,\" caused him to laugh uproariously. \"My boys are the toughest in the city. What makes you think you could make this place any more secure?\"\n\n\"*Information* Security. Your boys are indeed the toughest in the city. And usually carrying as well, legally of course. One of the prerequisites to be a butcher in your shop is to have a CCL permit.\"\n\n\"That is correct, I'd like to protect my investment in this, the best Butcher shop for a hundred miles. We have only the best products, and word of mouth gets around.\"\n\n\"It is a *very* profitable butcher shop, I must congratulate The Don on his success!\" I wasn't sure this was going to work, but if I was going to butter him up over anything, it would be this. But it worked. I had figured that I needed something like this if my plan was going to work, so my confidence was growing.\n\n\"Thank you kindly!\" He smiled with an actual grin this time, he did actually care about the shop itself, as I'd suspected, and this smile was different than his normal smirk. This one was honest, compared to his normal smile that felt more like a tiger, happy to be eyeing down its next meal. \"But I don't see why I would need to keep this information secure?\"\n\n\"And your choice of investments in particular, a Butcher's Shop. Truly an inspired choice, to pair that with the Mobster vibe that New York City is so famous for. People love it so much because it makes sense, of course Mobsters would be butchers by day, to have an excuse for any random blood stains. You've played that up, to astounding success.\"\n\nI was still riding that wave of butter, it hadn't clicked for him yet. These compliment jabs were hitting him right in his soft spot, and I could see that it was weakening him. \"Your words are simply too kind. You said your favor was information security, not compliments!\"\n\n\"The soft pricing, with specials and changing demand causing you to have some products change pricing drastically, The Don's patrons seem not to mind that as well. A bastion of the old free markets, 'We're almost out, but if you want it that badly...' and the customer can decide. Inspiring, and *very* profitable. Many wealthy patrons come to your shop in particular because it's the only place they can get what they want, and they don't care about the price.\"\n\nAt this, his eyes began to narrow again. I'd identified the heart of the real business in such a way as to bring his attention to it, without confronting him over it. Without actually saying I knew. I still had plausible deniability, I could fall back on the compliments as my explanation, but the third one in a row caught his attention. \"And I suppose you think this information needs to be secured? This is a high class establishment, word of mouth travels among the elite circles of this, the greatest city in the world.\"\n\n\"Indeed, word gets around. Word might eventually reach the ears of some curious individual who likes to ask questions and connect dots. Word of all these things might get around. And your #1 Rule is 'Don't ask questions.' I would just hate for someone to come around asking you questions, Don.\"\n\nI'd made it to the finish line. No questions asked, and at the mention of connecting dots, The Don started to connect the dots himself. First his eyes widened, in an expression of shock that I'd never seen on his face before. Then they closed, as he replayed the last 60 seconds of conversation we'd had in his office in this new light. A smile slowly crept to his face. His eyes opened again.\n\n\"Ahh yes, I see now. Information security. You're correct, we wouldn't want anyone to come around asking questions. Here is my offer to you, for this favor. Double what you're getting now, an additional month of paid vacation. The only change in your work duties from this promotion, is that you will also occasionally pay me compliments on my business, as you see fit. Your honest compliments today have truly touched my soul, and I find them to be valuable enough that I would ensure you stay on with us.\"\n\n\"I humbly accept this gracious offer from The Don.\" Outwardly I was calm but inwardly I was a complete mess. I wanted to scream from the top of a mountain. I expected to be sent out of his office, was praying I could leave immediately, but instead, after a brief pause, he seemed to decide that the way I'd handled things was deserving of even a bit more.\n\n\"Could I perhaps interest you in some additional roles regarding Information Security? The increased compensation would be appropriate for such additional responsibilities.\" Ahhhh fuck. I was afraid of this. Handled it too well, and now The Don wants me to join the mob. This one's going to be delicate. He knows I know, now. But he also knows I'm discreet; I just have to assure him I'll continue to be discreet.\n\n\"Thank you, Don, but I'm afraid I'm not ambitious enough to take on more responsibility. The Don has treated me well, and the favor The Don has granted to me this day is more than I could have dreamed of. The Don's offer of an additional *promotion* beyond the incredibly generous one I've already received is *asking* too much of The Don. I would prefer to continue with my current employment under The Don.\"\n\nHe thought about my double compliment more clearly in the light of the responsibility I *had* accepted, and sighed. Repeating \"The Don\" as many times as I did worked, and so did the stresses I had added to the last sentence. He opened a desk drawer, and pulled out two bank-wrapped stacks of $100 bills. \"Please, take this, and take the rest of the day off. I have much to consider. You may go.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, Don. The Don's magnanimity when it comes to those in his employ is truly unmatched.\"\n\n\"GET OUT!\"",

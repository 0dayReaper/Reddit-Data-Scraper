            "comment": "\"Why don't you just kill them?\"\n\n\"Because they're living creatures, Lindsay. You ask me that every ti\u2013\"\n\n\"Oh shut up,\" she rolled her eyes, cutting him off. He sighed as he opened the door to the backyard. The moon was full but barely visible through the clouds. He knelt in the grass and whispered, \"Today you, tomorrow me.\" The spider leapt from his palm and disappeared into the darkness. He crouched there for a minute, wishing that he too could disappear into the darkness. He just didn't have the strength to leave. \n\nNo one believed that she had given him his scars, they didn't want to believe. He saw it in their eyes. They would laugh, mock him, shrugging it off, waving their hands, shaking their head as if to rid their ears of the words. He didn't tell many people, a coworker, a guy from the gym, his brother, and his best friends from school. The disregard for his confession hurt more than a book to the head or a fork to the arm ever could. But nothing hurt more than her betrayal. Every apology was a glimmer of hope that the woman he'd fallen in love with would return. Every insult she spat and object she hurled made him wonder if she was ever there, or if it had all been a dream. \n\nHe stood up slowly and turned to go into the house. *If I were more understanding, more giving, patient, she'd remember what we had and come back,* he thought. He'd had thousands of similar thoughts. He was a fixer. Maybe he could fix it. Fix himself, fix her, fix them. Deep down he knew he couldn't, but his hope and her blame kept him tied there.  He'd tried counselors. He went alone when she'd refused to go. And when she insisted that he stop, that the counselor was driving them apart, he'd stopped. He shook his head, disappointed in himself again. \"Honey,\" he said opening the door, \"what do you think about trying to see Dr. Smith again?\"  **WHACK** He heard the sound of glass shattering, but he didn't know what had hit him. He struggled to get up, but something else hit him. And he went down again. \"Lindsay, please...\" He looked up to see her looming over him, his old baseball bat in her hands, and he put his arms up to protect his face as she swung at him over and over and over and then she was shrieking. \n\n\"What is that??? ***scream*** Get them off!!! GET THEM OFF!!!\" He lifted his head to see his wife being swept out the back door in a wave of blackness. He thought he was hallucinating. His head was throbbing, bleeding as he struggled to get up. Leaning against the back door he watched as she disappeared into the woods, her scream echoing. \"Lindsay!\" he called after her, attempting to follow, but he collapsed in the doorway. \n\nThe next morning he woke up on the couch. He groaned, eyes adjusting to the early morning light. The room filled with evidence of the night's events but Lindsay wasn't there. He started to sit up to look for when he noticed a black rectangle on the wall. It looked like it was moving. Slowly, the blackness shifted, forming the words: \"Yesterday us, today you.\" ",

Whichever boat you're in: have a safety plan in place. Even if it's not a bag of clothes or whatnot (if you think it would be found), map out a couple safe places you can go, safe contacts you can make once you're out and can stay with, or a local battered women's shelter. In Texas, they're opening more male shelters, too, depending on where you live, so maybe that's something else you can look into if you need. \n\nAlso, law school clinics usually offer some kind of free legal assistance, some specifically targeted towards battered (including emotional abuse, fyi) partners. And there's also the national domestic violence hotline, in case you just need to talk to someone to help you figure out what you want/how to escape. 1-800-799-7233. Best of luck.   \n(*Edits - words)",

You made me cry outside my daughters kindy because you made me remember how I had to survive for her.

Apparently the Dutch speak the best English in the world because they learn it so well, but they don't learn many of the flaws that people have picked up over the years.\n\nThe colloquialisms and other linguistic quirks are very interesting, but as the dialects subvert from the \"standard\" of the language, they too become \"incorrect\".\n\nLearning a language is also very different from picking it up from use. Depending on what your first language is you will also have trouble with different parts and may think entirely differently.\n\nMany people act differently depending on which language they are speaking. Language may affect you more than you think. It'is actually super interesting.",

            "comment": "It had all come down to this. I stand upon this roof top silently contemplating my life. I had always been the compassionate type. Each day I made as many selfless acts as possible. I don't like to see anyone or anything struggle. I am the type of person that always gave away my spare change, helped elderly women across the street, and even things most people wouldn't blink about like setting spiders outside instead of killing them. \n\nI had spent my life helping the helpless. Maybe because I knew what it was like to be helpless. There was no good reason why I was depressed. I had a fairly normal childhood. Nothing stands out that could've potentially lead to my depression. None of that really mattered anyway. I've grown tired of trying to help those around me, because every time I begin to feel as if I'd made an impact, I realize the world is just as desolate as before. I've never felt amy sense of purpose or belonging. In my eyes, all the caring I've done never amounted to anything in my life. My last wish is that my impact is remembered by somebody, anybody. \n\nI feel a cold rush of air overcome my senses. It fills my nostrils, makes my eyes water, whistles through my ear, sends shivers across my skin and violently thrashes my long unkept hair. I have no time to think, it doesn't feel fast or slow it just kind of happens. As I begin to realize the gravity of the situation I collide with something. \n\nI yelp, shortly before realizing that I feel no pain. For a brief moment I am going upwards until I come down and fall delicately into what appears to a large tightly woven spider web! The crescent moon lighting allows me to barely make out, that I am about ten feet above the ground. Slowly I see hundreds, maybe more, spiders come into focus. From all angles I see eightfold eyes staring back at me, and then they begin to move in a flurry of excitement, Quickly they disperse leaving a small area clear and obvious. Spelled out a l\u00e1 Charlotte's Web, I make out the words, \"Today you, tomorrow me.\"\n\nIt turns out that all of these years someone remembered all that I had done. ",

            "comment": "Adam Kinsley awoke to a nightmare.\n\nThe adrenaline pumped so hard that the blood sang in his ears. He rubbed his eyes, pinched himself, then distractedly struck his alarm clock off the nightstand in an effort to silence it, but still the images remained. He took deep breaths, then reached for the phone by his bed. Maybe talking to somebody would break the spell, he thought.\n\n\u201cJenny?\u201d he said, after the second ring.\n\n\u201cAdam? What the\u2026 it\u2019s 7.30 AM! Are you still at home?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust wanted to check, you know, if I was dreaming.\u201d\n\n\u201cDreaming? Have you been drinking? It\u2019s Tuesday! You better not be hungover! The September presentation\u2019s today! Jesus! Get your ass to the office!\u201d\n\nThe phone slipped from Adam\u2019s hand. He was a born salesman, able to talk the ear off anyone who would listen, but he somehow couldn\u2019t find the right words to describe how a sea of spiders had blanketed his apartment ceiling, covering it from edge to edge in black, furry, chitinous carapaces.\n\nHe wondered briefly if this had anything to do with the spiders he had been rescuing and setting free. He never saw the point in killing them, not when they were harmless and kept other pests away, but he had also never knew they would infest in this manner. Regret and anger swirled into a potent cocktail, clouding his mind.\n\n\u201cThis is how you repay me? When it\u2019s the most important day of my career so far?\u201d he said, as he slid from his bed, inching towards the door. \u201cMy landlord\u2019s going to kill me, you know that right?\u201d\n\nFresh horrors awaited him in the living room. All points of exit were swathed in what appeared to be layers of cobwebs, and the morning sun streamed but weakly through the swaddled windows. Adam turned as he heard the scurrying of a million legs behind him, and barely held up his hands in time to ward off a stream of spiders flying through the air, erupting towards him.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Adam cried, as he lost his footing and fell. He expected to connect hard with the teak floors, but instead he bounced off a freshly-woven coat webbing, cocooning him. He flexed, but he barely made any headway. A chittering filled his ears, and he had to fight from opening his mouth to scream.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he whispered, the tears filling his eyes. \u201cI never hurt any of you, I always watched out for you. Why is this happening to me? I just want to go to work, forget any of this happened! Please, please\u2026\u201d\n\nThe webbing soon covered him fully, though the spiders left just enough space for him to breathe through and to peer out from. He lay on the ground, facing the television. He wriggled, tried to get away, but he could not move. He tried to scream too, but no one heard him. His prison was complete.\n\nThen, stretching his belief to the point of breaking, he saw a single spider, triple the size of those around it, dangle down from the ceiling, swinging closer to the television. The other spiders moved away from it, giving it the space it needed. The queen then extended a single leg, then activated and turned the television on.\n\nThe news channel logo flashed briefly on the screen, before cutting to a newscaster on the streets of New York. Adam recognised first the deli in the background, then the street signs, then the building in the background of the shot. The familiarity was unmistakable, especially after he had worked at the same place for years. He could even imagine himself there, at the scene, already reporting for work like any other day at his office on the 110th level, were it not for the sudden infestation of arachnids.\n\n\u201cReports are just coming in,\u201d said the newscaster, the panic and worry etched clearly on her face. \u201cThere appears to be an explosion on the north tower, over 100 floors up. Eyewitnesses say that, and I\u2019m having trouble believing this myself, but they say that a plane, yes, a plane\u2026\u201d\n\n--- \n\n/r/rarelyfunny",

It was a habit I got used to. I guess as I got older I also turned into more a pacifist... maybe trying to make up for all the nasty things I had done in my youth. I would mumble a little prayer and toss the little bastards off into the night. My castle seemed to be littered with them. Felt like a magnet for the eight-legged. Maybe it was all the torches outside, attracting all sorts of bugs and the like. \n\nI don't know.\n\nAll I know is today I heard a crier bell swinging loudly in the early morning. There was talks of a large squadron of Barbarians coming through the foothills, plundering all along the way. I gathered my few men, what several I had, and had them armored. I was to go out with them at Dawn. We started our crusade down to meet them. But as the sun began to rise I noticed a strange blackness still enveloping the countryside. It seemed to almost shudder and breathe. Then at once I saw the Barbarian horde on the distance. They were quick approaching, bearing steel with clenched teeth. All of a sudden, the blackness of the countryside moved with frightening speed, followed by hundreds of thousands of spiders through the castle behind me, and within a minute there were bloodcurdling screams of girlish terror sung into the early morn. The barbarians flee'd as quickly as they had advanced, dropping all weapons and belongings in their stead. I shuddered at the thought, but then remembered my old prayer...\n\n\"Today you, Tomorrow me.\"\n\nTangled wed indeed!",

He wore a beat-up MSU hoodie and holey jeans. \"*Sparties*\" I mumbled as I reached for my pocket, acquiescing the mugger's command. The sound I heard after that, though, I'll never forget as long as I live.     \n      \nIt was a skittery sound. Skittery is the best way to put it. Like a branch against a window in the wind, but, like, *thousands* of branches against *thousands* of windows. Up the street the sound came. Along with it, a tune. I couldn't quite place it at that moment.     \n    \n\"Uh... the wallet, square!\" Shouted mugsey. Ignoring the archaic insult, I felt strangely at peace with the tide of sound incroaching me and my quarry in this dank, filthy alley. The skittering grew louder, and with it the tune. I knew it by then. It was an old marching song; \"When Jhonny comes marching home\".    \n          \n\"What in the ever loving is that?\" I asked my assailant.       \n\"F---ed if I know...\" said the man plaid in green-and-white, \"but I don't like it... *WHAT THE HELL?!?*\"     \n     \nJust then, a black-and-brown tidal wave crashed around the corner of the alley! A sight you'd curse your mother for telling you she'd seen, but I swear it happened! All of them, in chorus: \"The spiders go marching one by one! Hurah! Hurah! The spiders go marching one by one!  Hurah! Hurah!\" The press of arachnids came and covered my would be mugger.     \n     \nEncasing him, they turned him horizontal, then began to carry him out of the alley, his muffled screams escaping his lungs the whole time. As they went, the marching hymn still echoing through their fangs. At that moment, a little black one with two yellow stripes jumped up to me! \"This is the end!\" I thought, \"It's my turn!\"      \n     \nWhen she reached my ear, her tiny voice called out \"Yesterday, us! Today, you, big man! Thank you for your kindness throughout the years!\" And with that, she hopped off to join the press.     \n       \n\"Wait!\" I shouted.        \n      \n\"Yes, spider friend?\" The envoy replied.       \n     \n\"That song... Isn't it about ants?\"      \n       \n\"*Ugh*\" She replied. \"*Ant cultural appropriation*\"",

            "comment": "\"Oh God... Please... I don't wanna die!\" \n\nMark had been hanging here for what felt like days. He was beyond exhausted. Weak from dehydration and hunger, his bite had moved beyond excruciating pain; his leg felt like it was on fire. It was too much. He was delirious from fever and the poison in his veins. His blurry vision darkened as spots swam in his vision. Finally, the last ounce of a strength fed by the pure need to survive faded. His arms gave. \n\nMark had one last insane thought before gravity overcame him and he plummeted down the cliff face, \"There never was a tomorrow.\" And then he fell.\n\n\"So you're sure he's going to be alright Doctor Whitner?\" Stacy asked. Her younger brother had disappeared on a group camping trip, only to be found a week later alive, barely, at the bottom of a thousand foot drop. He was immediately air lifted to the closest hospital.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Anderson. He should be awake any time now. He's remarkably well, all thing taken into account. Mark must have an angel looking out for him. From what I can tell from his injuries it seems as if something must have broke his fall. Possibly multiple times.\n\n\"Honestly it's astonishing. He survived the fall with mostly only scrapes and few cracked ribs. Other than the snake bite. We're weren't sure we would be able save the leg, but thanks to whomever had the wherewithal to take the time to treat it on site, he should still have all his original parts when he leaves.\n\n\"It's the oddest thing though. When the air ambulance brought him in, he was absolutely covered in some kind of silk threads.\"",

I tried as hard as I could to dash out of the way, but I had noticed it too late. I prepared myself for the end.\n\nThe boot froze, the giant pulling back his foot. He bent to the ground, gently pulling me into the skies. I let out a breath of relief as I saw where was taking me- back to the land of the sun. He let me to the ground gently, but before he returned to his cave, left me with a parting whisper.\n\n\"Today you, tomorrow me.\"\n\nI gave a small prayer of thanks to the giant. He had saved me from them.\n***\n\n*Seven Years Later*\n\n\"Matt!\" My dad yelled from the other room. \"Go take the trash out.\"\n\nI sighed loudly, heading into the garage to look for the bags. I found them piled up in the corner, smelling much worse than I had expected. I heaved the first one onto my shoulder, it filled with metal trash and was rather heavy, opened the garage door, and headed towards the dumpster. With a small grunt, I heaved the large bag into the bin. It landed with a resounding clang.\n\n*That was odd.* I thought. *Wasn't today Thursday? Shouldn't there be more trash?* Normally the bags of uneaten food would pad the ground. I shrugged it off, moving to pick up my family's bags of left over lunches and dinners. The bag was far lighter than expected, so when I picked it up, the motion caused the bag to rip. \n\nA few maggots flew out of the bag, one landing on my foot. I jerked back, giving out a small scream as I scrambled to turn on the lights. My fumbling hands finally founds the switch, and as I went back to inspect the bag, I found that there was *no food* left, only a few maggots.\n\nThe maggots were dead, small bite sized marks leaving most of them completely disfigured.\n\nI screamed again in shock, stepping back to look at the garage as a hole.\n\nThat's when I noticed it. There was a hole in the garage, the size of a soccer ball, that seemed to have been chewed into by something... I stood frozen with a mixture of fear and awe as I wondered how it could have happened. As I stood watching, a few small rays of light began to appear at the end of the tunnel, making me realize two things.\n\nWhatever created that hole was still there, and going inside the house.\n\nThe only room with a light on was Luke's. \n\nMy two year old brother.\n\n***\nPart two coming here (as in this thread) in literally 15 minutes \n\n[r/ConlehWrites](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConlehWrites/)!\n\n",

I reached Luke's room in what felt like seconds, opening the door to see the small light above him still illuminating. Luke let out a small whimper. My heart dropped in relief. Luke was fine. I flipped on the light, scanned the room, and located the hole. Confused that there was no creature in the room, I started to walk towards the duct tape laying by Luke's new half finished bed.\n\n*Wait.* I froze. *The floor.* My eyes had finally adjusted enough to notice it. Thousands of roaches, eyes red and hungry, stood motionless on the ground. \n\nI jumped back, screaming loudly, throwing the duck tape at them in a panic. The roaches, realizing they had been discovered, let out a bloodthirsty scream and began to ravage their way towards Luke's cradle, chewing threw anything in their path. They cut across the center of the room as the door beside me opened, my parents entering the room. My mom let out a scream of terror while my dad dashed towards Luke. The roaches cut him off, the quickest ones reaching the cradle and starting to chew on it's wooden structure.\n\n\"NO!!!\" my mom screamed, agony tainting her voice. I stood frozen, trembling in fear, watching in horror as Luke's cradle began to sink inch by inch towards the ground. I could barely make out my dad throwing books and tools towards the roaches in an attempt to fight his way through.\n\nIt was pointless. The roaches dodged each projectile with precision, losing not even a single member as they split off, a quarter of them advancing towards us. Luke's cradle fell even closer to the ground, a mere foot from the swarming army.\n\nI felt a horrible sinking feeling in my stomach.

                            "comment": "\"Strike!!!\" I screamed as I hit the ground, my dragline silk saving me from a rough landing. I landed atop a roach, feeling primal satisfaction as my legs pierced it's head. I weaved my way to the top of the cradle, standing by the young giant, surveying the invasion. \n\n\"Strikeforce Longlegs,\" I spoke to a group that had landed near me, \"Clear the climbers.\" They nodded, each one raising four legs in a hasty salute as they headed to the edges of the cradle, utilizing their long legs to keep the roaches from eating their way up.\n\n\"Delta Force Jumpers, get to the big giants. Pick off their arial spies.\" They too nodded, giving a much more crisp salute. They were the pride of the spider force. I watched in pride and awe as they flung in to action, a few jumping to the roof, striking at the enemy fly spies, but most clearing the roach army and landing by the shocked giants. There weren't many of them, but they would hold against the roaches until the Longlegs could clear the child giant.\n\n\"Widowmakers,\" I said, noticing the small group of black elite assassin spies that had appeared by my side, the once dark corner of the room looking slightly lighter. A trail of roaches marked the route they had taken.\n\n\"Make some noise.\" They smiled, their shadowy forms disappearing into the battlefield.\n\nI surveyed the battlefield. The longlegs had managed to clear the cradle, the element of surprise lending us great aid, but the roaches had started to rally, advancing in practiced formation. A few ran around without a head. I looked at the far field. Delta Force had had far more success, with the aid of the giants, but even there were starting to get pushed back. \n\nI gave a sigh and jumped down from my vantage point, my tarantulan jump flinging me towards the center of the Longlegs.\n\nIt was going to be a long night.\n\n*** \nPart Three tomorrow if there is interest (will post here and at [r/ConlehWrites](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConlehWrites/)!)\n",

            "comment": "I stared down at it, a black, unmoving point on an otherwise clean sheet of a white-grey faux-granite counter-top. This was the third one this week alone, damned spiders, testing the very limit of my patience. \n\nWith a heavy sigh, I gathered up the usual equipment: a glass and a piece of paper, and returned to the invader. It hadn't moved. At all. I almost thought it was dead, but when I lowed the paper to scoop it up it walked up into the middle and got comfortable. \n\nThis was a game.\n\nWasn't it?\n\nI left the glass on the counter and walked the spider on its paper chariot out to the sliding-glass door and set the whole paper down on the patio. \n\n\"Today you, tomorrow me. Tell your buddies.\"\n\nIt hesitated, first leg stretched out, waiting, as if I had anything else to tell a spider. When I said nothing, it scurried off into the grass, probably to do spider things. Like hunt. And eat. And be good at spider things. \n\nThe TV flickered the same stuff it always did. I paid it as much mind as I usually did as I walked past it and dropped myself down on the couch. \n\nNothing. \n\nThere was nothing. \n\nBills, yes. Mounting as they tended to do. Faster than the bottom line in the bank account. Especially now. Especially with the job gone and the last severance cheque spent. The phone never rang. Never buzzed. Email was always empty, even when there was unread mail. \n\nI found myself staring again. At the blank wall. Thought about going to bed, but the clock read four-in-the-afternoon. The light from the TV changed from blue to white, just outside of my line-of-sight. There was no sound, but I don't remember ever hitting mute. \n\nI guess four-o-clock isn't _that_ early. \n\nI stood up, lingering by the couch as a point of black on the wall caught my eye. \n\n\"Again?\"\n\n\"Yesterday was me, today is you.\"\n\n\"W-what?\"\n\n\"Yesterday was me. Today is you.\"\n\nI turned to the bottle of pills the doctor had given me. It sat on the counter, where it belonged, top screwed on tightly. Beside it were a pair of black dots. \n\n\"Last week was me. Today is you.\" \"A month was me. Today is you.\"\n\nMadness. Madness was finally grasping the last few straws left in the jar of my mind. \n\n\"Come.\" \"Come.\" \"Come.\"\n\n\"Follow us. Today is you.\"\n\nWith no pause I headed straight back to the bed room, arms waving as I walked through the invisible strands of webbing that grew thicker and thicker the farther I went back into the darkness. They grew thicker and thicker, tangling into my hair, hanging from my dress and my ears, clouding my vision as it all grew colder, drier, calmer, blacker. \n\nThey scurried across me. \n\n\"Today is you.\"\n\n\"Today is you.\"\n\n\"Today is you.\"\n\nThe webs were as thick as ropes. Sticker than honey. But I paid them no mind. Passed through them. Followed the chanting further and further back. Inches became feet, feet became yards, and the yards vanished behind me until the light of the living room was a distant memory. Far beyond sight. \n\nThere I came upon her. From the waist up: human. From the wait down: spider. She was beautiful. Graceful, face, white dress made of countless threads woven together. Lacy. Delicate. Against her coal-black skin and the brownish fur of her abdomen. As the dream-world took form, I could make out that her human bit was not much larger than I. \n\n\"Hello... Human...\" She shifted, slowly, \n\n\"H-hello. A-a-re you hurt?\"\n\nShe smiled, but only with her lips. Her eyes were weary; they tracked me slowly as I made my way through her chambers. Her third leg, on the left, it hung limply despite the best attempts of her tiny retainers to patch her up. \n\nI reached out, brushing stiff hairs out of the way. She didn't recoil. She might've not been able to. Instead, she just watched as I found the wound. Deep, festering. It broke through the tough outer shell and cut into the open artery below, letting her blood seep out and down along the rest of the leg in pulsing rivulets.  \n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Human wacked me,\" she said. \n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"I was smaller. At the time.\"\n\n\"You know... I was reading the Wikipedia article on spiders the other day...\"\n\n\"Is that what you do?\"\n\n\"It is now,\" I said. \"Keeps me sane. Apparently didn't work.\"\n\n\"Do you know what to do?\"\n\nI looked at the wound again and put my hand over the opening. Blood flowed behind my hand, pushing against my palm, and the leg twitched. Slightly. But I couldn't keep my hand there long. The pressure built and it wasn't long before my strength failed and my face was sprayed with blood. \n\n\"I know what to do...\" I said between coughs and gags. \"I need a rock. A sharp rock!\" I told the thousands of spiders that surrounded me and the beast. It wasn't long before one came riding a living wave to my feet.\n\n\"Perfect.\"\n\nWorking quickly, I stuck the rock through my dress, just below my knees, and sawed. Once it was big enough, I stuck my hands into the hole and ripped it the rest of the way until my dress was reduced to a tiny skirt. \n\nWith the large strip of fabric, I began tearing more pieces. A big one. Several thin strips. And when I had them all I stopped the wound, and tied the strips as tightly as I could until the wound was just about entirely closed. \n\nOnly then did I stop to wipe my face and took a moment to admire my handiwork. \"There.\"\n\nThe spider queen stretched the leg out, slowly, testing it as the strength slowly seeped back into the very end. She lowered it to the ground, trying to put pressure on it, but found it weak. Too weak to hold its share. \n\n\"It won't be instant,\" I said. \"You need to rest some more.\"\n\nShe shifted around, seven legs working in tandem to make up for the weak link. With her human hand she reached out and stroked my chin before leaning over and planting a kiss on my forehead. \n\n\"My children said you'd know what to do. How right they were.\"\n\n\"T-thank you.\"\n\n\"No. Thank you. What is your name, human?\"\n\n\"Evelyn... but I prefer E-V.\"\n\n\"Well, E-V, go now, with the blessing of Lolth - Queen of Spiders.\"\n\nBehind me, a light twinkled. I could just barely make out the TV over the hum of spiders. I turned, as if I was going to walk away. Go back to real life. With bills. And news. And no direction. \n\n\"Actually, that wound isn't going to heal overnight. You might want someone to stick around. You know, keep it clean. Maybe even give you someone new to talk to. I can definitely use a friend.\"\n\nFor a moment, I thought she was going to say 'no'. But the stunned look soon gave way to a girlish squeal, and with the strength of three men she picked me off the ground in her human arms and hugged me tight. \n\nAfter that little slip up, she cleared her throat and patted down her lace top. \"Well then. I declare thee E-V - Princess of Spiders.\" \n\nI bowed down, as I thought was appropriate and there, below the ragged remains of my dress, was not the two human legs I expected, rather, the back-half of a spider and all eight legs, waiting for my command.

            "comment": "You sit, hunched over in the darkness. Paralyzing fear, and the horrible realization that you are trapped for an eternity on your throne which once was a place of comfort sets over you. You close your eyes and a tear slowly drips down your anguished face. You reflect on all thoes good times which built the trust you once held for the palace now betraying you. In retrospect, it seems there were so many signs, so many opportunities you could have taken to try and avoid this. Even so, deep down you know it would have only prolonged the inevitable. This endless torment that you must face alone. It almost seems funny now, how easily you could be saved from this torment if you had anyone close to you left, but they're not here now. You can't deny that being your fault though, so you decide to stop plauging yourself with what has happened, and instead devote yourself again to the situation at hand. Minutes pass as you try in vain to think a way out of your entrapment, but as minutes pass to what seems like hours you just draw blanks. Your resolve to free yourself slowly dissolves to self pity, and quickly you find yourself sobbing, tears now flowing freely, and you seemingly resign yourself to your fate. You can think of only one way out, the poket knife you carry on your person religiously. You tell yourself you can end this all quickly, one sharp flash of pain and then it's all over. You pull the knife out of your poket and open it. You place it over your left wrist, trying to work up the courage to action your final act. Finally, you move to end it all, but just before you do, you hear a faint, scattering sound, where you expected silence. You shake yourself, knowing it mist be your imagination. Back to the task at hand. You bring the knife back up, this time with stronger resolve.  Once again, as you try to cease this pain you hear the same sound, this time louder. You put down the knife, somewhat intrigued at what this sound is. It grows to a constant scuttling that makes your skin crawl. It grows, seemingly coming from an adjacent hallway. As it continues to a dim roar intruige turns to fear, and you start to question whether something else hasn't come to add to your torment. Faster and faster this thing tears down your hallway and terror and suspense mingled in your heart and you let out a squeak. Just as it you expect it to slam through the door, displaying the horror that has been building in  you mind it stops. Everything falls silent and all of a sudden you can hear your heart pounding, your heavy breath betraying your location to whatever is behind that door. Slowly, the door starts to creaks open and you need to stifle a scream. In the darkness you can't make out what dark figure lies behind it, before it starts to make it's advance. As it does you realize it isn't one figure, but rather thousands put together to become one, and you start sobbing again. This time not of despair or grief, but of relief. They came for you. You had never truly expected them to aid you, even in a time as dire as this, but they had. They approached in unison, and as they did the one object that could save you emerged from the swarm. It looked like a white amulet as they brought it forward. Hesitantly you reached for it, fearful that it might be snached away at the last moment as some cruel joke. As you grasped it felt more real than anything, the soft feel of it filling you with warmth, and for the first time, hope. With two hands now, you turned to your side and inserted it into it's pedestal. Upon completion the army of small creatures immediately retreated, hustling away. As they left, you could almost pick out a small echo: \" our debt is repayed\", and silently you nod your head. After the sound of their departure fades to nothing and you are alone, your focus returns to the object brought to you. A smile spreads over your face as you unravel the object and carefully fold it on your leg. Then, with the utmost care, you wipe you ass, stand up, and flush the toilet. That is most definitely the last time you forget to check for toilet paper when your roommates aren't home.",

            "comment": "The most important thing a person can learn in life, is that Kinship is more important than Kin. Just because you're related to someone doesn't mean that they're your family. I'm saying this, because not long ago I learned where that distinction lay and how far a family will go to protect those they care about. \n\nAs a kid, I thought I had super powers; the ability to turn invisible. I could go hours or even days without anyone acknowledging me or realizing I was in the room. But I eventually learned it was because I was the fourth kid out of seven, and living with parents who would scarcely be able to raise a single child, even if they chose to stop drinking away every cent they earned. I wasn't invisible, I was simply not worth noticing, which at least served to spare me from my parents sporadic bouts of rage in my younger years. But, once I was old enough to go to school, learn to read, and be able to pick up old, discarded novels from goodwill, I gained a new power. \nTeleportation. \nThe power to go wherever a book could take me. To escape from my rotten life, my squalid home, and the strangers called my family who I was forced to inhabit it with. It was my little escape, something only I had, and something that nobody else could take from me, no matter how badly they wanted to. That much was made evident as I grew, I was finally noticed, and met by waves of insults and accusations from my parents and siblings. It was as much as I expected; that if I was reading, I must think I was better than them. That I had some kind of aspirations that I'd never have the potential to fulfill. How dare I want a better life than the particularly shitty hand I'd been dealt!\n\nIt was one day when I was reading Jude the Obscure at goodwill, when I saw it happen. Scuttling across the floor, a tiny spider with only seven legs, barely escaping the stomping feet of the stores manager. For the first time ever, I felt that flash of kinship, where I felt like I understood someone. That spider and me, living in places neither of us liked and where no one wanted us, always unnoticed and even when we were, we became a problem. So, I did the only thing I could. I dashed over and cupped my hand, slamming it down over the spider and using my book to scoop them up before the shopkeeper could take another step. I exited with my new friend in hand and deposited him in the mess of webs nestled in the corner of the shops doorway. \nEvery day from then on, no matter where I saw them, if there was a spider about to be killed or in danger, I'd make it a habit to stop, scoop them up and set them down outside or close to a crack or crevice they could make them a good home, sometimes even with a small word of advice. I could have sworn the little buggers stopped and looked up at me in response before shimmying their way into the relative safety of their webs and hiding holes. But I was already talking to them, so I guess it didn't seem that unusual at the time.\n\nIt was the night of my sixteenth birthday when I found my true home. It was just coming on midnight when a pair of loud, blundering steps coming up the stairs signaled the conclusion of my parents drinking for that evening. Their obnoxious hyena laughter pulled me out of the book I was reading for just long enough to peer through the crack in my bedroom door and make eye contact with my boorish, drunken father. That was mistake number one.\nThat was all the provocation he needed to come barrelling through the door, waking three of my other siblings in the process, eyes still fixed solely on me.\n\n\"Well look, if it isn't Einstein, still up reading his precious books at all hours of the night!\" he breathed directly into my face, his nauseous stench wafting up my nostrils. I turned away and said nothing.\n\n\"What's the matter you little shit? Spent so much time with your head in them books that you've forgotten how to speak? Lydia! Come see! We've made one so stupid that he can't even speak anymore!\" he belched back to my equally intoxicated mother, who promptly stumbled in, giggling like an idiot.\nI did my best to continue ignoring them; but my silence seemed to motivate them, to try and get a reaction out of me, more than anything. Their attempts became increasingly desperate and furious, spitting, cursing and yelling, but I still refused to acknowledge them. That's when my father took my book and I finally reacted. That was mistake number two.\n\n\"You think these are gonna help you where you're gonna end up, huh?\" he gloated, dangling the book in front of my as I attempted to swipe it away before he could pass it to my mother. \n\"Because they're not! You're going to end up amounting to nothing, working for nothing pay in this nothing city and having kids who amount to nothing just! like! you!\" he barked, prodding my chest with each word for emphasis and glaring angrily. \"So let me do you a favour and help get rid of that pesky ambition for ya!\"\n\nThat's when my father opened my book and, with a look of glee on his face, violently and systematically tore out every last page. That one act unlocked the floodgates on sixteen years of repressed anger and neglect, and for the first time in my life, I stood up for myself.\n\n\"That's where you're wrong! I'm not going to do any of that, because I'm not staying in this shithole for a second longer!\" I yelled, barging past my worthless parents and towards the stairs. \n\"And I'm glad you two found some relief in drinking rather than reading!\" I added as I took my first step downstairs. \"This way, you'll be dead at least fifteen years earlier than I was hoping!\"\nThat was mistake number three.\n\nI didn't feel the bottle smash over the back of skull as much as I heard it, and then the stairs suddenly rushed upwards to meet me. I could feel myself tumble down the steps roughly, bumping and twisting as I fell, but it all felt as if it was happening to somebody else and I was sort of watching it from afar. I came to stop suddenly on something soft, too soft to be the stairs or floor, lying face up as I saw my father coming down the stairs, the bloodied and broken half of the bottle still in his hand. My head lolled and my eyes felt like they were being weighted down as I lay there, the edges of my perception becoming blurred; but the last thing I remember before I lost consciousness was the image of my father looking down at me and suddenly screaming out as he slipped and was seemingly dragged down the stairs by the shadows that rapidly swallowed my vision. \n\nWhen I awoke, I was resting on something soft and white, what I initially thought might have been a hospital bed. But when I sat up, and saw the millions of tiny legged creatures surrounding me, I knew it was no hospital bed. My head pounded viciously, but when I put my hand back to inspect the wound, I found it to be bandaged in the same silky white material that I was sleeping on, with a few spiders seemingly there to keep the compress clean and secure. Hearing a slight shuffling to my side, I turned to see the spiders were carrying in a book for me, Jude the Obscure to be precise, and resting atop it was an especially small fellow with only seven legs. I took the book from them, my seven legged friend seemingly trying to wiggle his way in between the pages. I opened it to the page he was trying to reach, and he began to do the most amazing thing. He would scuttle back and forth between the same words seven words over and over again, tapping his little front legs on the ones he wanted me to see. They read as thus:\n\n&gt; You Us Help.

I don't know!\", I cried as I got another kick in the gut, protected by nothing but the rope the chackled me with.\n\nApparently, the thing they want from me is  a valuable jem hidden somewhere in my house. I thought the previous owner was shady, but who'd think he worked for mafia! He probably took it with him when he moved, and sold the house for cheap so a blockhead like me would get beaten for him.\n\n\"Boss, I think he's the wrong guy.\" One of the thugs started to doubt.\n\n\"He's the one. The adress is right, and Mike would never lie to me.\"\n\nGuess, it's my unlucky day.\n\n\"But you're right. Burn this place to the ground. We're getting out of here.\"\n\nIt definetly is.\n\n\"I told you he sold the house and ran away with the jem!\", I cried as my last attempt to survive.\n\n\"We know. We were just checking if that were true. But now, you know too much. So... We have no choice.\" Finished toying with me, he exited the room; his minions started to spill gasoline; and I lost it.\n\n\"Is this the end?\" I murmured to myself. \"Will I die like this? Because of a misunderstanding!? Toasted in my new house!?\"\n\nI heard a quick \"chick\", and saw a burning match falling on the floor. The room lighted bright red, and the two black silhouettes locked the door from the other side. Now I'm doomed.\n\nSurprisingly for me, the two silhouettes weren't the last black I saw in my life. From every angle, I could see black goo stretching across the room. It seemed intelligent as it opened the door, the window, and the knocked down furniture in such a way that it blocked the fire from soreding on me. Then, I felt lots of tiny bumps under me, and the room started moving. No, it's me! I'm moving! That's where I understood what the black goo is.\n\nYou see, from the small age, I learned not to harm a living thing. Every life is sacred, and even the smallest bug has a soul. So my whole life I was letting them outside, carefully taking them in my hands and putting them on the nearest bush. Later, mom told me to whisper \"Today you, tomorrow me\", and one day they will come to save me. But not that literally!!!\n\nThe bugs lifted me up from the ground and carried to the window. Then, using their super-strength, they tossed my huge body a meter to the air right through the window into the hands of a swarm of flies and mosquitos I've let feast on me and my food; before I could realise it, the flying mosquito matress put me safely on the ground and bit my ropes off.\n\nNow I was witnessing the hellish furnace that was just my room, and my savior coming out of it in the face of black goo spilling down every crack on the street.\n\nOne day later, I was back at my old place, happy that I didn't tale everything with me to be burned with the new house. I turn on the TV and see my face on the screen. \"One man turned down the largest crime organisation in the city\". For this act, I received compensation for the damage, and then some for the organisation. With so much money, I couldn't think of anything better to fo than to donate them to the animal saving groupes. Especially insect ones. They deserve a thanks.\n\n_______________________________\n\nSorry for any mistakes, was writing it on a bumpy ride.",

            "comment": "Jace opened the antique mason jar and gently set the glass container on the grass, tipping it methodically on its side as the jet black spider scampered out of its cage and down the beaten path. \n\n\"Today you, tomorrow me.\" He whispered. \n\nHe had always been the tender hearted one. Soft wouldn't be the word for it, for he was strong and well built, but knew in his soul that all life was precious. His twin brother Sevlin had been his polar opposite; burning, crushing and poisoning at every chance. Jace felt as if he were bringing the world slightly back into balance every time he saved a life and he had saved more of the 8 legged creatures than he could remember. \n\nJace looked at his watch, half past noon. He had spent too much time clearing the house and at this rate he would be late. \n\n\"Shittt\" he groaned as he tore off through the trees, it was 5 miles to the training grounds and his father would be angry.\n\nTightening the strap to the rifle slung across his back he wove his way through the path his father had cleared so many years ago. How many times had he done this now? Since his sixth birthday he had been coming to this place with his father and brother, honing his skills, training to become a.. a killer. But today there would be no training. Today was the Division. \n\nBeep beep, beep beep. \n\nFenton silenced the alarm on his watch and then looked to Jace who had just slid into the clearing  \"you barely made it son.\"\n\n\"Sorry father... I was... cleaning the rifle one last time\" Jace lied trying to catch his breath. \n\n\"Sure you were softie\" his brother Sevlin sneered. \n\nJace had cleaned it several hours before, but the truth would have only given his brother a reason to really lay into him. \n\n\"That's enough Sevlin\" his father commanded. \n\nFenton was a domineering man, cold steel being the only way to accurately describe him. Tempered and hard, unmovable in his beliefs. He truly was a man made for this world, or maybe that was just what the world had made him. \n\n\"You both know what today is\" Fenton said, his jaw stiff, eyes stern. \"Today one of you lives and one of you dies.\"\n\nJace grimaced. \n\nThe Division was a way of life. Like his father and his fathers father and all generations before, all male children were born twins, their identical counterparts being their greatest obstacle on the path to becoming a man.  It was also the day Jace had grown up dreading the most. \n\n\"Father, please\" Jace pleaded, keeping his voice low, hoping his twin hadn't heard. \n\n\"You're not getting out of this brother\" Sevlin sneered, a wild look in his eyes. \"Today you die.\"\n\n\"You know this is our law Jace\" Fenton said, \"this is the way it has to be.\"\n\n\"But WHY?! WHY?! You never tell me anything, WHY does it have to be this way?\"\n\n\"That's enough, now get ready\" Fenton commanded.\n\nThey had practiced this a thousand times, methodically both boys drew their rifles, checked their magazines and drew back the charging handle, the solid click of the bolt slamming a bullet into the chamber confirming both weapons were ready to kill. \n\nThey would enter the woods at different ends of the clearing and slowly work their way to engage each other and the inevitable result that awaited. \n\nJace closed his eyes, trying to muster the courage to do what must be done. Palms sweaty, he tightened his grip on the rifle and began moving through the trees. Any other day of his life, this is where he felt most at home. He would often spend the night in these woods, listening, learning, wondering if any of the creatures he had saved might be out here living, thriving. \n\nCrack, BOOM. The tree next to Jace's head exploded, his brothers maniacal laugh echoing through the forest. Jace turned and began running. \"I can't do this he thought, I can't do this, it's not right, no matter what happens he's my brother!\"\n\nDeeper and deeper into the forest he ran, his brother's gun barking behind him. The forest was darkening now, this was a part Jace had never been to before, it was as if the trees were swallowing the light around him, and still Sevlin followed. He was close now, too close.  \"I'm coming BROTHER!\" He yelled. \n\nThis is it Jace thought turning and beginning to take aim, its now or... \n\nWhat?! Wha.. what's going on? \n\nJace dropped his rifle, stunned. Before him was the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.  White thread, as far as his eyes could see, beautifully woven in the most intricate patterns. Light gleaned from every strand reflecting the majesty of this creation, and in the middle of it all... was Sevlin, bound up to his neck and struggling to loosen his bindings. \n\n\"My God\" Jace said \"that isn't thread, it's a... a web\". And then he saw it, an army of jet black spiders, they were EVERYWHERE, and they were perfectly still. Still except for one. One lone spider was moving, crawling in his direction. A shudder went though him, what was going on, am I going to... to die?! Slowly the creature crawled to him, it crawled up his leg, under his shirt and up to rest on his neck. Not daring to move, not daring to breathe Jace waited, his mind racing. \n\n\"Today you, tomorrow me\" it seemed to whisper as two razor sharp fangs thrust into his neck... and the world went black. \n\nSlowly, Jace opened his eyes. \"Where, where am I? What happened?\"\n\n\"Well done my son, you survived.\" Said his father's voice as Jace tried to rise \"Easy, take it slow\" he commanded. \n\n\"Father?\" Jace groggily muttered regaining his senses, \"What is going on father? TELL ME!\"\n\nHis father looked at him for a long moment then stood and began walking deeper into the forest. \"Follow me Jace, we have a lot to discuss. And bring that rifle.\"",

GOD, WHY?!\n\n[So...yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqgW-2orQQg)\n\nI bet you're wondering how I got here. Nobody with any shred of sanity wakes up in the morning expecting to watch their landlord get dragged away by a mass of angry spiders that very afternoon, but here we are.\n\nIt all started in 2002, when I was in middle school. I was a pretty normal kid, but I had kind of a phobia of spiders. I knew most of them were pretty harmless where I lived, but I saw a movie where a guy got bit by a spider, and started melting into a dude smoothie, and it scarred me, man. So when I saw a spider in the corner of my room, I reacted as any rational person would. I screamed like Fay Wray and sprinted down the stairs to get my dad to kill it. He grudgingly followed my up to my rom while I babbled like an idiot, and I pointed at the spider. He looked at me, groaned and pointed to my bed. I sat.\n\n\"Okay, kid, you gotta deal with this whole 'spider' thing you've got. I get it, we shouldn't have let you watch that movie. But this spider's so tiny, it probably wouldn't even break the skin if it bit you.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Look at the thing. It's so tiny. It couldn't do a thing to you, and you want me to kill it?\"\n\n\"But, dad, it-\"\n\n\"Butts are for poopin', kid. There's no point in hurting something that won't hurt you, and that hurt'll come back to you anyway. My grampa always said, 'today you, tomorrow me.'\"\n\nDad blinked.\n\n\"Of course, he said that to justify not beating up the black guy next door. Complicated guy, ol' Pap-Pap. Racist as all get-out, but a firm pacifist.\"\n\nI didn't really have a response to that. Sometimes I think my dad made stuff up to confuse me into not questioning it, but I couldn't deny he had a point. So now I had a roommate. For the better part of the year, I pretty much let it have its corner of the room to itself and pretended it wasn't there, but after a while, I got used to it. Once or twice I'd have a friend over, and they'd try to kill it, but I always stopped them, mostly so my dad wouldn't ground me.\n\nThat spider stayed there in its little corner, all the way through 8th grade, and then through freshman year. I thought that was a little weird, but I don't know much about spiders, so I just assumed it was the kind of spider that just lived really long. By year 3, it was getting to the point where I considered it a pet. I had named it \"Silky\" by this point, and decided to give it a proper little vivarium to live in, and fed it with some crickets I'd buy from the pet store. Silky seemed to love its new home, just filled that thing up with this really cool, elaborate web.\n\nEventually, I went off to college, and brought Silky with me. By this point, he was at least half a decade old, so I decided that I'd bring him to one of the teachers at the biology department, who referred me to an entomology professor. He had nothing. He'd never seen it, or anything like it. It was a totally new species. I let him study it for a little while, brought it home, and didn't think about it.\n\nI got an apartment just off-campus, and the landlord seemed kinda stiff, but alright. I had a steady job, and the rent wasn't too bad, so I thought I'd be fine. But then, one fateful day, I was a little late on my rent.\n\nI tried to call my landlord and explain that I was a little short, and that I'd be able to pay him back next week when I got my paycheck. So he knocked on my door, later that very day, with a huge vein popping on his forehead, and his skin a burning red.\n\nI cautiously opened the door, and he slammed it the rest of the way open, and started just, *screaming* at me. Calling me a lazy, entitled, millennial piece of shit with no respect for the rules of society. Just, going and going for about fifteen straight minutes, full of the worst stereotypes about old people's opinions of young people, with five minutes where he got diverted into something about Obama and Kenya, which he managed to somehow pull back around into how shitty I was for being young and not having money.\n\nIt was kind of amazing, honestly. The guy was like, 70, and he just kep going, barely stopping to take a breath, keeping up full volume from start to finish in this hypnotic sort of rhythm. In fact, he only stopped when my jaw dropped and I pointed at the enormous spider that was slowly lowering itself onto my arm. And then another. I don't know where they came from, but there was a swarm of spiders, bringing our little story full-circle. I'll spare you the screaming a second time, but suffice to say, the landlord was much more understanding of my one-time lateness once he got out of the hospital. He had some bad bites, but nothing really serious.\n\nThat evening, I just had to sit down, because holy shit, wouldn't you? While I was sitting and trying not to think about what happened, I looked at the vivarium, and noticed Silky was missing. And then I looked around, and noticed that it was sitting on my keyboard, staring intently at me. It just looked at me, like it was saying \"You protected me, you fed me for all these years. I will do the same for you.\"\n\nI nodded appreciatively, and the spider nodded back.",

Low police activity after midnight was convenient for people who liked to speed a lot, but they were even more convenient for other kinds of rotten apples...\n\nA man came walking out of an alley and blocked Tom's path. \"Hey kid, you want weed?\"\n\nTom took a few steps back out of caution, but his botherer came closer, making it clear he wanted something. Tom turned around and walked in a fast pace, ignoring the man's manipulative questions. His luck wasn't really active today -- another man appeared from behind a red car, also blocking Tom's way. Tom turned around and the former man pressed a knife against his throat. \"Give me your wallet, right now.\"\n\nTom was about to reach for the pistol in his jacket, but was distracted by a swarm of black little entities crawling over the sidewalk towards them. The thug behind him was getting impatient. \"Don't make this any harder boy.\"\n\nThe tiny creatures made a big jump towards the man who drew the knife, which he let go of. \"What the fuck!\"\n\nI backed away, the man behind me fell over while he saw his friend getting walked over by hundreds of tiny little spiders.\n\n\"Help me! Please, Richard! Aah-\" The spiders entered his mouth and began to feed on the insides of his throat, choking him and dissolving his vocal chords. The spiders seemed to have an organized way of 'eating', as half of the other spiders were busy with clearing his outsides. Tom saw the victim's body shaking unnaturally, the spiders were consuming his nerves, slowely paralyzing him. I backed away more whilst his friend sat on the ground like an ice sculpture, unable to move, waiting to be the next one to 'melt'.\n\nTom drew a pistol to the eaten's traumatized friend's head. \"Listen, this is fucked up okay. They're coming for you next, but I'm offering you a chance to-\" he stopped talking after seeing that the man put all of his attention to his dead friend, still staring in the same direction with an open mouth. Tom knew that killing him with a shot was the better choice; he had seen these things happen dozens of times before and was more or less used to it, anyone who wanted to flee from his spiders would still be found and eaten alive.\n\nThe spiders were done with their first meal, and their second meal was almost offering himself up. They entered through his trousers. Tom couldn't make himself pull the trigger and put his gun back in his jacket.\n\nThe man was rolling over the ground. \"No, no please! Not my penis!\"\n\nTom ran away, there was nothing to be done by me anymore.",

            "comment": "\"Just fucking kill it, Michael. i'm tired of you and your ~they are harmless~ shitty philosophy\" she said before smashing the door on her way out. That was the last time i heard of her in months. \nI was never the perfect boyfriend, but i always gave my best, always tried to improve, i guess i wasn't good enough for her, or for that job, or my family. I guess i just wasn't good enough for anything really. \nMaybe i tried too hard to be good with everyone else, but i wasn't good with myself. I didn't deserve it probably, i was just a jobless dude with no future, no idea of what he was doing and a lack of will. Maybe i never deserved to be happy.\nAfterall i just throwed away my relationship for a little 8 legged dude that never did anything for me. Na, it wasn't their fault, it was mine, i shouldn't even be here, i don't have any purpose. Probably the best thing i did was saving it and her friends and letting them go in the garden, i saved them and Mary got free of me, now she can be happy.\nI went to the kitchen, grabbed a bottle of whiskey that i was saving for a special ocation, what's more special than the end?\nPoured a glass and went to the bedroom, reached the .38 from the back of the highest shell from the wardrobe.\n \"Aah, what a pitty the use i'll give it, i should've gone to the field, at least to shoot some cans. Guess my father won't be proud of this either.\" I thought as i looked at the only heritage off my father.\nI drank a last sorb of that old whiskey and put the gun in my head.\nI took a last breath and placed the finger in the trigger, but it was sticky and hard. I looked at the gun surprised, there was a bunch of spiders there, making a web around the trigger and the gun. I couldn't understand what was going on. \"not now little fellas\" i said as i grabbed and putted them in the wardrobe. But they kept comming, the floor, the ceiling, even the inside of the gun, from everywhere. I fell in the bed shocked. They were filling the gun in webs, i felt a sting in the hand that made me drop the gun. I tryed to grab it again, but the gun started to move with hundreds of spiders beneath it. \n\"I just want to end it, plis\" i said, with a knot in my throat. \nI heard a noise, a voice, comming from the bed, \"Mickey? Are you okey?\", It was my mom on the phone that was in top of the pillow, \"Mickey? You are scarying me honey\". I grab the phone, shaking, \n\"hey mom, sorry, can you come over?\" I said crying.\n\"On my way, honey, wait me there\".\nAs i put my phone away i look at the room full of spiders. In the bed, they looked like they were arranged so i got up and looked again, they were forming letters, a phrase.\n\"Today u\".",

This is the first prompt that really caught my eye, and a buddy encouraged me to share what the prompt had inspired on here. Rather nervous, but figure I should become a more active part of the community! Hope y'all enjoy the quick read as much as I enjoyed writing it. Thank you :)**\n\n**Today you, tomorrow me.**\n\nAs I stood there in the street \u2026 I wasn\u2019t sure if I was caught in some twisted wet dream of a fourteen year old me \u2026 or the nightmare of a Stephen King Carrie rip-off.\n\nThe forlorn wail of sirens somewhere in the distance still registered somewhere in the back of my mind, heat pulsated from the flaming engine of the slag heap that was once my car, the upholstered leather seats of a mid-range Toyota coup set alight by the fireball which had melted the hood down into canyon of blackened metal. The heat to my left was offset by the downpour of freezing water to my right, where a city maintenance truck had barreled over the divider and pulverized some poor fire hydrant and released a geyser that probably rivaled Ol\u2019 Faithful\u2014I wouldn\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never seen Ol\u2019 Faithful, but just go with it.\n\n*Fireball. Molten car.*\n\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d I\u2019m not sure what snapped me out of my startled daze, it could\u2019ve been the blue jump-suited city worker who was a man much larger than me in size \u2026 and girth. But the more likely suspect in this case, was the buxom blonde bombshell strutting toward me. She was hot. *Like really hot.*\n\nIn more ways than one.\n\nI yelped, tearing my eyes from the increasingly shrinking amount of cloth covering less and less of her sensuous curves as twinkling pinpricks of flame ate at the retreating edges. She cackled maniacally as a flick of her wrist sent another blazing bolt of flame my way. I stumbled more than dove, out of the path the sizzling spell for the safety offered by my slag heap.\n\nI trembled in place, hugging the ground and cherishing the shallow puddle of hydrant water that soaked my shirt. What I had done to wind up in this situation? Beneath the flames\u2014which this close sounded like the snapping of a hundred California redwoods\u2014I could hear the steady steps of her stilettos hitting the asphalt. The metallic taste of blood wet my lips as I peaked up over my arm. In a cruel twist of fate, the kind of joke life seemed to play on you at your lowest moment, I could see the butt of my Springfield XD, and with it the 9mm rounds that would\u2019ve probably saved me, and put this bitch into the ground.\n\n\u201cWhen they said you were the worlds greatest bounty hunter \u2026 I\u2019d expected more.\u201d Her voice was paralyzing, a tone and lilt so sweet that it could\u2019ve passed for one of Willy Wonka\u2019s beloved candies. I felt the pressure of her heel in the small of my back, pinning me down, threatening to push through and crush my spine. Her shadow which fell across me was just as curvaceous and eye-catching as the rest of her\u2014and I hated that I\u2019d die, half-aroused. By a shadow. \u201cAre you going to say anything? What\u2019s it that you mortals say? Any last words?\u201d\n\n*Bounty hunter? Any last words?* Who\u2019d this lady think she was, Judge Dredd?\n\n\u201cL-lady.\u201d I squirmed for a moment, feeling the pressure of her heel raise off me, and flipped onto my back. *Damn, what a view.* \u201cI\u2014\u201d *look at her eyes you moron. Her eyes.* \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh you don\u2019t?\u201d She seemed amused. Raising a delicate hand, tongues of flame blinked into life. \u201cI figured you\u2019d die with a little mo\u2014\u201d\n\nAnd just like that. She stopped. It was as if she were an animatronic at Chuck E\u2019 Cheese, and someone had just yanked the plug. Her eyes were fixed on the horizon, straight down Fourth Street. I took a hesitant breath.\n\n\u201cA little more?\u201d I ventured.\n\nThat\u2019s when I heard the sound, beneath the emergency sirens becoming slowly louder, the crackling flames, the pattering of water, there was a skittering noise. It grew by the second in intensity, moving from a tinkling of needles on tile to a simmer of bacon grease in a pan. Even the paralysis of imminent death couldn't stop my curious self from shimmying to one side for a better view of what had rapt the Human Torch\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d her and I muttered in unison as we watched a mottled wave of earthen tones wash down the avenue. A million arachnids of varying size scuttled over mailboxes, cars, fences \u2026 homes. Everything in their path.\n\nThe Flaming Bitch\u2014seemed an apt name\u2014took a step back, then a second, then a third. She snapped her arm out, a scorching ball of flame spun toward the endless swarm. The sea of arachnids parted, then rejoined. Her fireball dissipating harmlessly against the shred of street that had been momentarily exposed.\n\nThey were a few feet away from my face now. For some reason my mind hadn\u2019t thought of the idea to run, but running wouldn\u2019t do me much good right now anyway.\n\nHundreds of spiders in the front of the horde parted, as if making way for a king. Curiosity replaced fear. The Flaming Bitch and I watched in stunned silence.\n\nA lone spider hobbled out to the forefront, one of his eight legs conspicuously absent. I recognized the little bug, he\u2019d been in my kitchen not a week prior.\n\n*Today you, tomorrow \u2026 me.*\n\nThe four words I\u2019d repeated countless times, flashed through my mind. The same four words I had whispered to this seven-legged creepy crawly the morning I\u2019d released him on my porch.\n\n\u201cStop.\u201d\n\nI glanced back at my would-be killer, wondering why her voice had dropped to a basso more appropriate for James Earl Jones. She glanced down at me and gave a quick shake of the head.\n\n\u201cLeave him now, or perish.\u201d the voice commanded.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t The Flaming Bitch, no, it was the mother-lovin\u2019 spider.\n\n*What. The. Hell.*\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; END &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n",

            "comment": "They swarmed him before I had any idea what was going on. Ten, twenty, a hundred. How many had I caught and released over the years? It could not have been this many, not even close. Still, they came, my memory of those I set back into the world shoved away by pure volume. A writhing mass of twitching legs and eyes beyond estimation sweeping down upon the man I had come to fear before his tirade ended.\n\nHe tried to run. When it was a single arachnid or a pair or a trio, he did little, swiping at them, directing his anger from me to them as he batted them from his arms. Then they came on in gangs, schools of the dark furred assailants rushing toward him undaunted. They slid through cracks in the floorboards, oozed in from the bottoms of windows, poured forth from walls like horror movie blood. That is when he ran, but he did not get far.\n\nAt first I thought they were devouring him. He soon grew so covered in undulating blackness that I could only assume the spiders began making a feast of him. When he stumbled to the ground, thrashing but unable to rise, crushing hundreds but enraging hundreds more, their plan became clear. Sunburned flesh, smokers teeth, and stained wife beater were soon lost beneath the layers of white thread. Silk embalmed him, a body bag of gossamer muffling his shrieks as every inch of his slovenly form were wrapped within the world's most macabre tortilla. When their work proved sufficient, the spiders dispersed, an army dragging the twitching, encased body of my landlord away by his bald, silk coated head. All I could was stare, mouth agape.\n\nI would not be getting evicted after all, it seemed.",

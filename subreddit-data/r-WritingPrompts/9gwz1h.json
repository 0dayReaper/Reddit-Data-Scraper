            "comment": "\u201cBut seriously,\u201d I continued, \u201cwhy is there a naked man sitting in the corner?\u201d\n\nSocrates scratched his chin and studied the man for an uncomfortably long time before replying: \u201cWonder is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d\n\nIt was the closest thing he\u2019d gotten to a reasonable answer. At least it wasn\u2019t another question.\n\nPlato, who seemed to always be by his side, defended him. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of his thing. He doesn\u2019t do straight answers. He wants to sound deep, but I can already tell you he hasn\u2019t got a clue.\u201d\n\nSocrates snorted at Plato. \u201cDon\u2019t you think, as my prot\u00e9g\u00e9, you should maybe show me a bit more respect?\u201d\n\nPlato, clearly sick of hearing this, shot back as if on script. \u201cWe both know I wouldn\u2019t still be here if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, you\u2019ve both been here thousands of years. Neither of you have even tried to figure out why that dude in the corner isn\u2019t wearing any clothes?\u201d They both shrugged.\n\n\u201cI think everyone who gets here asks the same question\u201d, Burt Reynolds interrupted, \u201cbut nobody I\u2019ve asked even knows what language he speaks.\u201d\n\nHammurabi joined the group and nodded at me and Burt. \u201cNew blood, eh? Let me guess, you\u2019re wondering about the naked guy?\u201d\n\nWe all waited to see if he was going to be the one who could add any insight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of very few people who has remained here longer than I have. And even I don\u2019t know who he is.\u201d\n\nI grunted in frustration. Ugh, sitting in the corner, turned his head to look at us.\n",

            "comment": "Meeting Shakespeare, in the beginning, seemed like it would be the best part of my first death. I\u2019d spent years playing characters in his plays. Had laughed with my friends when I was alive about the not so subtle dick jokes, and had read his sonnets to every person I ever loved. \n\nI didn\u2019t know everything about him before I died. I just knew I loved his work, and if I could recite sonnets by heart and quote Macbeth on a whim, it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\n\nThat first day, when I woke up with centuries worth of genius\u2019 staring down at me\u2014I had no idea what to expect. Prince helped me to my feet, while Edgar Allan Poe brushed the dirt off my back. Mathematicians watched us, and Freddie fucking Mercury smiled at me before returning to his conversation with Robin Williams. \n\nFor a brief moment, I thought I was in heaven. (Socrates was quick to point out that I was most certainly not. But I hadn\u2019t expected him to not be a dick, anyways.) \n\nAnd then I saw him. \n\nJane Austen must have seen where my gaze was, because she clasped a hand over my shoulder, and looked at me peculiarly. \u201cPlease tell me, that of all the people here, he\u2019s not who you\u2019re most excited to see.\u201d \n\nI barely glanced at her, as Shakespeare sat on a stool, watching two reluctant passer-throughs act out a new play. Passer-throughs, I learned, were those who would only be here for a brief while. I expected I was only slightly less of a passer-through than most. Mediocre actors could only be remembered for so long. \n\n\u201cHow could he not?\u201d I asked her. \u201cEveryone here\u2019s amazing, don\u2019t get me wrong. But he\u2019s the guy that shaped my entire life.\u201d \n\nShe snorted. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell him that.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nI finally looked at her, then. She turned her gaze on Shakespeare as well, quirking an eyebrow before sighing. \u201cPerhaps it is best if you . . . Get to know him on your own.\u201d \n\nAnd then, she\u2019d pushed me in his direction. \n\nThat first day felt fucking monumental. Standing face to death with William Shakespeare; the greatest playwright of all time. \n\nIf everybody on Earth had forgotten me at the exact moment, purgatory would have been amazing. \n\nBut, nope. This was Purgatory, after all. And t couldn\u2019t be all pleasant. \n\nAnd William Shakespeare. Is a fucking child. Not literally, obviously. \n\nBut he insisted everyone call him Willy \u2014 for reasons, clear but not to be named. And instead of crafting intelligent, heartwarming sonnets, or thought provoking plays\u2014all Willy wanted to do. Was write dick jokes. \n\nAnd brag about how long he\u2019s been in purgatory.\n\nAnd write dick jokes about purgatory. \n\nHe wrote a sonnet about me, once. That if read backwards?\n\nWas just a dick joke. \n\nPurgatory was just one big fucking dick joke. \n\nApparently, there\u2019d been a lot more dick jokes in his works, but his squire wrote most of them out. Left so few that nobody would know. \n\nPasser-throughs, no less oblivious than I was, excited to meet him, and act in new, original content, acted through whole short plays. He didn\u2019t give them the material beforehand, because his favorite part, was it clicking in their heads that they were talking about ducks. \n\nAnd if they didn\u2019t realize they were talking about dicks? He stopped wverything, laughing so hard there were tears in his eyes, to tell them, \u201coh my men, you have been grasping at dicks!\u201d \n\nWilliam Shakespeare was the equivalent of a walking, talking dick drawing a 12 year old boy drew into the condensation on bus windows before school. \n\nAnd, as I later learned, once you pick an idol on the first day, that\u2019s who you spend all of your purgatory with. Side by side, until everyone on Earth forgot who you were. \n\nWhoever the fuck turned that crappy, B movie I made with my friends in college, into a fucking campy cult classic better end up in hell.

            "comment": "Fred admired how, even in purgatory, human beings had found a way to emulate the high-school cafeteria stereotype.\n\nRacial discrimination didn't exist here, *title* was everything.  Were you a musician?  You eat, drink, converse, sleep near, and otherwise live with the other musicians.\n\nPhilosopher or Scientist?  Enjoy a daily lecture from Socrates or Newton, followed by a rebuttal from Plato.  Hawking was a new addition.  Fred admitted it was strange seeing him outside of his wheelchair and actually communicating.\n\nAuthor?  Well, Jane Austen has a seat for you.  Unless you wish to sit with the more \"edgy\" authors, in which Poe and his contemporaries stalked about their area of purgatory.\n\nEveryone had a title.  How odd that in purgatory, your stereotypes are what truly and actually define you.  There was likely some lesson to be learned in that, but Fred didn't wish to think on it.  He had a mission.\n\nHe made his way over to the great scientists and sat plum in the middle of them.  Newton was theorizing the matter around them and tying it into some form of thermodynamic supercharged particle that kept them locked in purgatory.  Or something.  Fred was educated, but a large portion of his experience on earth had been in Presbyterian schools.  He had long ago left behind his initial thoughts of purgatory because, well, he was here.\n\nAnd he still was not forgotten.  He didn't mind it, though.  Being here wasn't all that bad.  Sure, it was a little uncomfortable, but that's life, why wouldn't second-life be a bit uncomfortable?\n\nNewton stopped mid-sentence and stared in horror.  \"Fred?\"  Somehow everyone knew everyone's names here.  Another mystery both the philosophers and scientists attempted to answer.  Didn't matter to Fred.  All that mattered was he was here.\n\n\"Hey, neighbor!\"\n\nThe other scientists turned in confusion, likewise locking their gaze on Fred.  \"I, uh, well, as I was saying...\" Newton continued his lecture, acutely aware of Fred's awkward presence.  Fred pretended not to notice, nodding appropriately at what Newton was proposing.  Others piped in and offered their theories and expounded on each other.  Fred simply listened.\n\nIt had all started a few, well, *years* isn't the appropriate term as time had no real meaning here.  Suffice to say back some time ago, Fred had overheard the philosophers discussing second-death and what it meant to die a second time.  'Nobodies', as they came to be known, arrived and departed in purgatory almost by whim, leaving almost as suddenly as they arrived, whereas the more well-known among them lingered.  Some for centuries and even millenia.  They had proposed that second-death was tied to remembrance on Earth.\n\nPlato had rebutted that a third death was possible.  That wherever you went from here you once again remained until forgotten.\n\nThat got Fred thinking.  Perhaps it was a bit selfish on his part, but his Presbytarian upbringing had brought him to a final conclusion - after purgatory was heaven or hell.  Now, he was pretty sure he was going to heaven.  Therefore, if third-death really did exist, well, he didn't want to be forgotten anywhere.\n\nHe figured that by tying the whole community together, though, it would offset his selfishness.  Hopefully.  He faintly recognized further selfishness in that act, trying to \"cheat\" the system, but well, it was all he could do.\n\nOnce Newton had finished, he rose from his seat, and gave a polite nod to everyone.  \"Thank you, Sir Isaac.  That was certainly enlightening, and has given me some things to think on.  Now if you don't mind gentlemen, I have a few others to visit.\"\n\nThe great scientists nodded in agreement, less ruffled than before - or so Fred hoped.\n\nOver the 'weeks', he would visit as many groups as he could before his energy ran out and he had to retire.  \"Hey Fred, how is your little project going?\"  Ghandi had asked after one such journey.  He had expressed great interest in his little project, but as of yet hadn't mustered the courage to mirror his actions.  \"What did you learn?\"\n\nFred greeted his friend with a soft grin.  Gandhi had been the first to introduce himself when Fred had experienced first-death.  Truly as honorable as the history books made him out to be.  \"Oh, I met all sorts of people with interesting ideas and even cultures.  Isn't it odd how humans develop cultures even in purgatory?\"  He sat on a bench, and slowly removed his dress shoes, humming a bit to himself.  Old habits die hard.  *No pun intended*, he thought, chuckling to himself.  \"I imagine I won't be here as long as most of you.  But here is what I make of it.\"\n\nHe paused, a bit for dramatic effect and a bit to collect his thoughts.  \"I believe that the more we are remembered on Earth, the longer we are given to make an impact here in purgatory.  It is a *reward* for our deeds on Earth, to give us time to continue them here.  With no clear direction, it's easy to fall into lazy patterns of behavior, falling back on what you know best with others who know it as well.  I think the key to heaven is our impact in purgatory, not Earth.  Earth simply gives us a head start, so to speak, here.\"\n\nGandhi pondered a moment.  \"I think you're correct.\"\n\nWhen his time finally came, Fred Rogers was met with a chorus of 'goodbye neighbor!' as he casually slipped off his dress shoes and jacket, put on his sneakers and cardigan, and stepped through the door of light with his name over it.  He hoped it had been enough.  With how wrong he had been about purgatory, he had no idea what this \"second death\" would be like, or what was waiting for him on the other side of this door, but as he had told countless children during his time on Earth, he decided to be brave, and see what this next adventure had in store for him.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n________\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(I certainly don't think this is a literary masterpiece, nor do I think I got Mr. Rogers' characterization perfectly correct.  That said, I had fun writing it, and imagining Mr. Rogers continually helping others as he makes the next step beyond purgatory was nostalgic for me as well.  Thanks for the prompt.)\n\n^(**A very smol edit:**  Apparently Gandhi was an asshole.  Uh.  Insert random historical awesome figure.  MLKj?  Whoever. XD)\n\n^(**Another edit:**  I'm blown away by the responses.  Y'all are awesome.  I truly feel like this was one of my more \"thrown together\" stories, but I'm glad it had a positive impact on so many people!  Truly, thank you.)\n\n^(**A very vulnerable and big deal edit:** If anyone wishes to see my other works and give comments/critique, I have posted many stories to my personal subreddit /r/LedgeEndDairyWriting.  Feel free to have a gander.  I need to update it with the more recent stories I've submitted, but it's got a good 20 or so shorts there.  Any critique is welcome, I'm trying to improve.)",

Immediatly gets vaccinated.\n\n- Is a nuke-happy dick in Civilizations. Was also pro nuke irl.\n\n- Used to 'test his resolve' by laying nude with a harem of underaged girls.\n\n- Use Google, trust me, there are more reasons.\n\nTL;DR - Ghandi is to decent as anal warts are to pleasant. He is only painted as a good person because of a few choice actions. Figured I would share this interesting tidbit. :)\n\n\n\n",

The rest of us, well. Most of us just wait around here, pick up a hobby or two, gossip about what's going on down there in the mortal realm. Not much different from life, really, except the food's already included.\n\nMaybe a little *too* similar.\n\nYou see, a while back, once of the angels let some heavenly details slip. Poor thing was sentenced to a millennium working for his older brother down low, but the information's still out there. We're not really sure whether God doesn't know or just plain doesn't care, or if he wants us to keep doing what we're doing, but the info hasn't been erased from existence, so that's good enough for us.\n\nI glanced around me, before quietly pushing the balding head down, back through the clouds.\n\nSo, apparently how heaven works is that you get everything you ever wanted. Want to eat food for forever? You've got it. Endless harem of beauties waiting on you? You've got it. Master every skill ever? *You've got it.*\n\nThe thing is, any rational person knows that sounds like a hell exactly of its own. Oh, sure, it'd be fun for the first few days, but after a year? A decade? A century?\n\nI shuddered a little at the thought, remembering some of the secondhand descriptions my friend had given me.\n\nSo, to keep a long story short, someone decided there was no way in hell that they were going to get sent to *either* place. To do that, you've got to be remembered -- you've got to have people talk about you.\n\nMillion-dollar question: How do you do that? You're already dead.\n\nAnswer of a millennium? If you're *real* careful, you can send other people back. Have them talk about you.\n\nThe guy who chose me isn't around any more -- the angels caught him, eventually, and he was taken up to the gates, to be damned in hell or damned in heaven.\n\nBut before he left, he gave me the gift -- the gift of being remembered.\n\nI spotted another head rising up through the clouds. A young one, this time. Grabbed on, gave him a good eyeful of me. I doubted I looked like what he expected, but things change in a couple thousand years. He opened his mouth, \"Am... am I dead?\"\n\nI glanced around again. Still no patrolling angels.\n\n\"Not for long you aren't. When you get back, tell them Jesus sent you.\"",

A thousand and one metaphors for the simple fact her heart was no longer beating.\n\nIt was sudden, and then suddenly it wasn\u2019t anything at all. Sarah wasn\u2019t even sure how it happened. Not that it mattered. \n\nThe afterlife was an ambient gray; almost like a faint mist hanging in the absence of air. Through that mist, she could see shadows. Not alarming or predatory\u2014 though a part of her wondered if such things were even possible here\u2014 but calm and wandering. She felt she knew them all, intimately.\n\nThis one was Johanne, a young German boy whose mother occasionally cried out his name in the midst of night terrors and alcohol-fueled sobs, even now, twenty years later.\n\nThis one was Susan, an older woman who hadn\u2019t been here long, and likely wouldn\u2019t be here much longer. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for a friend.\u201d her voice whispered.\n\nAnd then there were the older ones. Mr. Jay, who was important enough in his life that those passionate about history still spoke his name. \u201cI won\u2019t be much longer,\u201d he seemed to whisper, \u201cSoon, my legacy will be forgotten. I can feel it.\u201d\n\nSarah could feel it, too. She would be here for some time, but it wouldn\u2019t even be eighty years before she moved on. Almost detached from her own life, she vaguely wondered if there was more she could have done, but decided it wasn\u2019t worth consideration.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so bad as she\u2019d feared in life. Even the mystery of where she goes next had lost all of its urgency and alarm. \n\nAnd then there were the oldest ones. Whose names were still spoken, even now, and who Sarah could feel would be here for much longer. Romulus, Beethoven, Saigo... souls marked not by how long they\u2019d been here, but by how long they had before moving on.\n\n\u201cNothing is permanent,\u201d one whispered. \u201cEven we will be forgotten.\u201d",

However, he has since been referenced in the musical *Hamilton*. Near the end of the first act, Aaron Burr mentions that John Jay wrote the Federalist Papers with Alexander Hamilton and James Munroe, but had to drop out due to ill health. John Jay gets \u201cremembered\u201d on-stage most nights, and by anyone singing along to the soundtrack. \n\nI do wonder how your dignified interpretation of Mr Jay would feel about his sudden late-in-death fame that\u2019s based on two lines in a collection of show tunes about someone else.",

One story goes that he died when, whilst being chased by a murderous mob, he stopped running rather than pass through and trample a field of beans.\n\nHe was also one of the earliest recorded vegetarians and that was also part of the philosophy he founded (although some would call it a religion or even a cult). He taught that unnecessary cruelty to animals should be avoided, and that killing an animal in order to eat it is an example of such unnecessary cruelty.",

            "comment": "I was alone, shaking, cold and shivering. The rain was heavy and unyielding, and the air had a rusty and metallic scent to it. It reminded me of something, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on what\u2026 \n\nI was standing on a train platform, though I couldn\u2019t quite remember how I had gotten there. Or where I was going. It was dark out, so I assumed it was late. But the sky above was devoid of stars. Devoid of\u2026anything really. There was nothing above but a deep blackness and when I looked up it felt like I was peering down into a endless dark hole with no end in sight. \n\nWhere was I? \n\nWho was I? \n\n\u201cHello baby.\u201d \n\nI jumped and turned to see a little boy standing next to me. He was peering up at me with a wide toothed grin. I realized for the first time that I was naked and I brought my arm up to cover my breasts out of reflex. \n\n\u201cH-hello,\u201d I stammered. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t see\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see me? I know. That\u2019s because you did\u2019t know me before. Now you do. I\u2019m Aafiya.\u201d \n\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I said awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026well\u2026.I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me your name. I know it\u2019s hard.\u201d \n\nHe sat down on the platform Indian style and patted the pavement next to him. Feeling strange, I parked myself down uncomfortably next to him. \n\n\u201cAre you cold, baby?\u201d \n\n\u201cA bit.\u201d I frowned. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d \n\n\u201cThey call this the In Between,\u201d He talked casually, as if he was discussing a day at elementary school. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot bigger than this, but this is the place you go when you are coming. Or leaving.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy are we the only ones here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re not. There are lots and lots of other people. Look around.\u201d \n\nI glanced about myself, confused. There was nothing else here, just a deserted platform that seemed to stretch on as a long as the eye could see. Which in this darkness wasn\u2019t particularly far. \n\n\u201cKeep looking,\u201d he said with a grin. \n\nI peered into the dark, feeling somewhat stupid. And then, I felt something. Like the forboding feeling you get when you\u2019re alone at night but you still feel the presence of someone of something in the room with you. I sensed movement in the shadows\u2026 no, that wasn\u2019t it. \n\nThe shadows themselves were moving! All about us there were shadows, imprints of people, standing, sitting, waiting. There were hundreds. Thousands. Millions! \n\nA shiver came down my spine.\n\n\u201cWho are they,\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the newcomers,\u201d he said simply. \u201cOr the ones who are fading.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we see them?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t know them,\u201d he said. \u201cOr we don\u2019t know their names, baby.\u201d\n\nWhy do you keep calling me baby?\u201d I asked a little irritably. \n\nHe giggled. \u201cBecause you are a baby. Or at least you were one.\u201d\n\nI narrowed my eyes. \n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got things mixed up, honey.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said with confidence. \u201cYou\u2019re a baby. All the nameless are babies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nameless?\u201d I blinked. \u201cI\u2019m not nameless. I have a name. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d I went silent. \n\nThe little one laughed, almost sympathetically. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know it seems weird. But it won\u2019t matter. You\u2019ll only be here a little while anyway.\u201d \n\nI looked down at him perplexed. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the In Between,\u201d he explained again. \u201cIt\u2019s where everyone goes after their first death. The physical death.\u201d\n\nI went pale. \u201cI\u2019m dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Your body is dead. And your mind, I guess.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut\u2026but then\u2026what\u2019s left!?\u201d  \n\nHe smiled. \u201cYour memory. Here is where all those stay as long as memory remains. When the memory fades, we go with it. But memories are attached to names. And if you don\u2019t have a name\u2026 you don\u2019t have much of a memory, I guess.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand!\u201d I shouted frustrated. \u201cI\u2019m not a baby!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re not a baby now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re just a memory. Like a ghost, of what could have been. After our first death, we come here. What we are and what we feel here are reflections of the mark we made on people\u2019s lives.\u201d \n\nI went silent. I wanted to argue but I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t even remember anything that came before. Only vague glimpses\u2026water\u2026and loud sounds\u2026and the rusty smell\u2026\n\nAafiya looked at me, as if he could read my mind. \u201cYou\u2019re shivering,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s raining,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cOnly to you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s bright and sunny for me. Someone is probably mourning you. Your mother, maybe. Do you know her name?\u201d\n\nI sat and thought. \n\n\u201cCassie,\u201d I muttered. \n\nHe nodded. \u201cWhen the Named come here, they usually appear in the forms that most people remember them as. The ones with the strongest names sometimes have the least stable forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nameless are different,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou weren\u2019t around long enough to make an impression outside the mind of your mother. Most of the Nameless, if they don\u2019t appear as infants, take the form of their mother.\u201d \n\nI peered down at my hands. It looked as if I could see straight through my palms, as if they were fading away. As if they never really existed. \n\n\nHis little hand touched mine and clutched my fingers. I noticed his hand seemed to be vanishing to. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sad,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone fades. It has to happen. You should be excited.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d \n\n\u201cBecause when old names die, new names take their place,\u201d he said, his eyes brightened. \u201cI\u2019m ready for my new name. You should be too.\u201d  \n\n\n\n",

I\u2019m certain I\u2019m going to be here until a big meteor wipes out every single human.  I\u2019ve made some friends.  Some people really despise me here.  They say I\u2019ve ruined their lives.  That doesn\u2019t really seem fair, but oh well.  I\u2019m never quite sure what someone thinks when they meet me here.  I think it really scares them.  I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, in my opinion.  Just trying to do the right thing.  A lot of things people heard about me aren\u2019t true.  Funny how things can spread like that.  People show up here every moment.  Some disappear just as soon as they appear, and that is very sad to me.  It means no one knew or cared for them.  People always kinda gravitate towards me.  I welcome it, but I\u2019m always cautious because I don\u2019t know how someone will react when they realize who I am.  It\u2019s not my face.  People get my face all wrong.  It\u2019s not my hair.

It\u2019s not Hell, either\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s purgatory.  When we die, we come here.  We have to stay here until our name is said by someone for the last time on Earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, damn.  Well I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be here much longer.  I might get stuck waiting for some creditors to realize I\u2019m dead and process my name one last time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s kinda sad, I thought to myself.

The realization that comes over people right now is always tough. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s...  uh..   Jesus\u201d. \n\n\u201cChrist\u201d, he said.  \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be stuck here forever.\u201d\n\nNot sure if he was saying my last name seriously, or taking it in vain.  \n",

Faith (at least, in the way that the christians i know talk about it) is believing in something that you dont have any evidence for. And faith is being strong in that belief, such that you don't doubt in your heart that its true. \n\n\nSo, christians are waiting for their messiah to come back. So they pray all the time for it. In a way, this constant prayer serves to remind themselves of their faith, but it also demonstrates a certain type of *lack of faith*. If they truly had full faith that their messiah would return, then they wouldnt feel the need to pray for it. Its the sliver of doubt in their heart that causes them to continually pray and ask for the messiah to return. \n\n\nBut the God says that the messiah will return when faith is completed. So the idea is that when people stop praying for it, then their faith is complete because they no longer have any doubt to cause them to pray. Simply living their lives without feeling like they need to consult with or pray for their messiah's return. \n\n\nThe moment that humans stop praying...the last time Christ's name is spoken...*that's* when the messiah is resurrected. \n\n\nTheres a shit load of interesting themes and ideas ripe for exploration there, but im no author. \n\n\nAlso, i guess...i *think* theres a lot of interesting stuff to explore there...but i could be wrong...maybe its cliche or not as cool as im thinking...lol",

Around me, others appeared and others seemingly walked through doors that weren't  there, not appearing the next step or any other.\n\n\nAnd so I walked.\n\n\nAround me were other wandering souls but there were those who chose to stay with others. After a while, one could pick out those who have become well acquainted with this space and those who were just passing through. \n\n\nAnd so I watched.\n\n\nI figured that there was some purpose to being here, possibly continuing what I started in life, or maybe it was all just because. Eventually I came to what seemed to be the Center. If it could be called that. There were some vaguely familiar faces and they seemed to have set up here.\n\n\nAnd so I stood.\n\n\nThese were those who were destined to a \"life\" in Limbo. Those who made their impact. They ranged from scientists and mathmeticians to war generals and artistic icons. All defined by the same destiny. Some decided to wait, aside from the main group. They would sit, and occasionally talk but they seemed content.\n\n\nAnd so I waited.\n\n\nBut they did not stagnate. The Greats would sit and just discuss. They had all the time they needed. This is the time for them to finish their work. However fruitless it felt.\n\n\nAt this point, I began to question why I've been afforded so much time before whatever is through those doors. What did I contribute? My work was impossible to be truly proven, even in the end I could not finish my own thoughts. But does it matter. This is just an extension of that on Earth. If that didn't matter, why should this. And why should any other? \n\n\nI watched.\n\n\nI watched as they began to individually disappear. Questioningly as they walked through the doors they swear did not exist for them. But they left. \n\n\nSo why am I here?\n\n\nAnd they panicked and theorized as they could, they were being forgotten. It began with Al Khwawrizmi. The passage of time feeling as dull as it did on Earth.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nAnd soon it was me and just a couple of the original group. \n\n\nWe sat.\n\n\nI sat.\n\n\n\n_*This was honestly just a stream of consciousness thing and my first response, please don't kill me :D*_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Allen had first stumbled across Thales\u2019 Bar only days after his death. He\u2019d still been lost then, in a bleary haze and still convinced he was in the middle of some terrible adderal and cocaine induced fever dream. It was almost funny, back when he was alive he\u2019d always joked that he would probably go out by ODing, but when it finally happened he just couldn\u2019t accept it. \n\nSo it was he found himself wandering the every changing streets of the land beyond the living. If you had asked him before his death where he would end up after death, Allen would have winked and sarcastically replied he was surely destined for the deepest pits of hell. Where all deviants and geniuses like him belong. In truth he hadn\u2019t really believed there was anything that came after, but there was. Shows how much he knew. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t hell, or heaven for that matter. It was just...was. Allen had always had a way with words. It was how he\u2019d made his living after all, but trying to define the afterlife was like trying to describe colors to a blind man. It was a city, most days. Sometimes it resembled New York, where he\u2019d grown up. Other days it looked like Victorian London, or a sprawling ancient Arabian metropolis. It was always changing, and he wasn\u2019t even sure if what he saw was the same thing others saw. \n\nAllen hadn\u2019t handled it very well at first. He\u2019d wandered aimlessly for what felt like days, and very well might have been. Time flowed strangely in this place. One second. One hour. It was hard to tell the difference if you weren\u2019t paying attention. So he\u2019d travelled the every shifting streets, begging those he saw for help. Sometime\u2019s the roads were filled with so many people he had to push his way forward and shout to be heard above the crowd. Then he would a corner and find himself on a vacant street, his ears ringing in the sudden and absolute silence. \n\nThat was how he found the bar. How long ago had that been now? Years, it had to be. Allen had come back often enough, when he could find the place. It was damn hard to find a regular dive in a place that kept changing, but he liked this place. It was cozy, the drinks were good, and it was tended by a kindly old man behind the counter. \n\nAllen slid onto the velvet barstool, folding his jacket across his leg as he waited for Thales to finish his conversation with another patron. He spent some time looking around. Today, the bar looked like fifties jazz lounge. It was dimly lit with red curtains hanging from the ceiling. Leather booths and polished glass tables were scrattered about. The place wasn\u2019t crowded, it never was. A man was playing a soft tune on the piano in the corner and the heavy scent of cigar smoke hung in the air. \n\n\u201cAllen.\u201d Thales appeared before him with a kindly smile, pouring a glass of scotch into a glass and sliding it across the bar-top. \n\n\u201cHow are you Thales?\u201d Allen asked, gratefully accepting the drink. \n\n\u201cAs good as I choose to be.\u201d The old man replied, before adding with a wink, \u201cSo very good.\u201d \n\nThen he was gone. Off to see to his other guests. Never an empty glass in his bar. That was his rule and he saw to it. Allen spun in his chair and spent his time loosing himself to the soothing sounds of the piano, nursing his glass. He didn\u2019t know how long he sat there listening. A long time, probably. \n\nA roaring laughter off to his side brought him back to himself. He glanced to the back of the bar to see a group of three men sitting in a round booth, chatting amongst themselves. They were an old trio, that was for sure. One was an older man with a long white beard, similar to Thales. He was wide man, and dressed in an simple robe tied around the waist with a sash. The man on his left appeared slightly younger, with a few grey hairs left in his own beard that hung down in front of his tailored shirt. His face was wrinkled but his eyes twinkled with youth as he laughed again. The third man looked familiar to Allen. He was tall, barely appearing to fit in the booth, with short curly black hair and a neatly trimmed beard. His expression was set in stone, but there was the curl of a smile at the edge of his mouth as he sipped his drink.\n\nAllen wasn\u2019t sure what drew him to the them, but he allowed the whim to guide him, walking over to the trio. It only occurred to him,  how rude it might be inviting himself over, when he was already at the edge of the table. The man with sharp eyes and a long beard looked up, pointing enthusiastically, and perhaps just a bit drunkenly. \n\n\u201cYou there!\u201d His Italian accent was strong even with the slight slur to his words. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you in here before. Would you like to join us?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh leave him alone Leo.\u201d The older man said, taking a puff the cigar between his fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s probably coming over here to tell you to quiet down that dog bark you call a laugh.\u201d The man turned towards Allen. \u201cSorry to bother you son. This one always gets a bit animated when he\u2019s had a few.\u201d\n\n\u201cN-no, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Allen replied hastily, shaking his head. \u201cI should be the one saying sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh you\u2019re not interrupting anything more than some old men\u2019s chattering.\u201d The older man waved away his apology with a smile. \u201cYou are welcome to join us if you\u2019d like though.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. I think I might.\u201d Allen said, sliding into the only open seat beside the tall man. \u201cMy name is Allen, by the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cSokratis.\u201d The older man replied before gesturing to his friend on the right. \u201cThis is Abraham,\u201d he gestured to his left \u201cAnd this drunken fool is Leonardo.\u201d \n\n\u201cDrunken fool you say.\u201d The one called Leo jeered. \u201cHow else am I suppose to lower my wits to you gentlemen\u2019s levels?\u201d\n\nAbraham hummed, turning towards Allen. \u201cForgive him, he feels so small next to us he must measure himself in other ways.\u201d His expression remained impassive, there was a warmth to his voice. For some reason it reminded Allen of his grandfather. Sokratis burst out in laughter as Leonardo sulked. \n\n\u201cEasy for you to talk, fucking giant.\u201d He muttered over his glass. \n\n\u201cAh, Allen. I see you\u2019ve met the boys.\u201d Thales had appeared once again and quickly refilled everyone\u2019s glass. He winked at Allen once before turning back towards the trio.\n\n\u201cYou know Allen was a writer before he came here.\u201d The bar owner informed them. Sokratis raised an eyebrow. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say? What did you write about? I must admit I\u2019m not very caught up on the schools of thought from your time.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell uhm.\u201d Allen coughed, embarrassed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything like that really. They weren\u2019t anything special. Just...stories. Fantasy, science fiction...that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cStories.\u201d Abraham nodded approvingly. \u201cIn my experience, stories can be the best kind of writing. In my time I frequented the theatre. Sometimes, those hours of loosing myself in the story was all that got me through the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did some writing myself during my life.\u201d Sokratis paused, coughing in embarrassment, \u201cWell...my students did the actual writing, but I like to think I guided the hands that sketched the letters.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even spell his own name.\u201d Leonardo ribbed him as Thales disappeared once again. Sokratis glared at him.\n\n\u201cSuch things weren\u2019t as common as they were in your time Leo. In fact if it weren\u2019t for me-\u201c\n\n\u201cYes yes,\u201d Leonardo cut him off, rolling his eyes. \u201cMy work stands on the shoulders of your greatness. We all know it. I\u2019m just saying even Abe here taught himself to write. In a log cabin, in the middle of the forest, on a shovel!\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be fair, we had a lot of shovels.\u201d Abraham said with a shrug. \n\n\u201cAnd I had a lot of Hemlock.\u201d Sokratis replied with a nod. \u201cStill, I\u2019m not ashamed of the life I lived, even if I wish I could have done things different.\u201d He took a long puff on his cigars.  \u201c*The limitations and regrets of our past should hold no sway over the ambitions of our future.*\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. You should write that down.\u201d Leo said pointedly. Sokratis narrowed his eyes at him.\n\n\u201cI did. It\u2019s in my new book. I gave you a copy weeks ago.\u201d The older man said. \n\n\u201cEhhhh....\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t read it have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten around to it.\u201d Leo admitted. Sokratis huffed and turned on Allen.\n\n\u201cWhat about you Allen?\u201d He asked \u201cWhat\u2019ve you been writing since you died?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I...\u201d Allen blinked, suddenly remembering he was supposed to be part of the conversation and not just an observer. What had he been writing? He hadn\u2019t written anything. What would be the point of that? He was dead. \n\n\u201cI...haven\u2019t\u201d He answered lamely. Sokratis smiled, a sparkle in his eye.\n\n\u201cThen if you do not write, then what do you do?\u201d \n\nAllen struggled to come up with an answer. In fact, he hadn\u2019t been doing much of anything really. Wandering, talking, drinking. Just *being* really. \n\n\u201cHa!\u201d Leonardo bellowed, good natured but still accusatory, \u201cThe boy\u2019s gotten caught up in the dream of the place. Bet you he doesn\u2019t even know how long he\u2019s been here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, do you?\u201d Allen shot back, feeling the need to defend himself. Leonardo smiled a self satisfied smirk.\n\n\u201cFive hundred and thirteen years, seven months and twenty-four days.\u201d He said, stroking his mustache, \u201cBut don\u2019t feel too bad. Of the three of us, I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s managed to keep track.\u201d\n\n\u201cForgive me. I lost track somewhere in the two thousands.\u201d Socrates muttered, taking a puff of his cigar, before looking back towards Allen. \u201cWhy did you choose to be a writer during your time on earth?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess it started out as a hobby.\u201d Allen answered truthfully. It had been so long since he\u2019d thought about it. \u201cIt was something I was good at. I liked it.\u201d",

                    "comment": "\u201cThen why did you stop?\u201d The old man was persistent. Allen pursed his lips onto a tight line. He hadn\u2019t expected this to turn into an interview. He looked to the other two men for some kind of escape, but both Leonardo and Abraham were watching him with interest. Sokratis himself seemed to be enjoying his discomfort immensely. \n\n\u201cI mean...\u201d He looked around, as if the answer was obvious. \u201cWe\u2019re dead right? End of the line. The story\u2019s over, and we\u2019re lost somewhere between the back cover and the authors thank you note.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm. I\u2019ve never thought of it in that way.\u201d Sokratis absorbed the somewhat bleak metaphor with a strangely excited smile. \u201cBut what about you? Can you not still write? Are you not still you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. I guess.\u201d Allen shrugged.\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t enjoy it anymore.\u201d Sokratis guessed. Allen shook his head. The old man didn\u2019t seem to get it. What was the point of writing fairy tails in the afterlife? \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that. It\u2019s like you said-\u201c He turned to Leonardo, \u201cThis place is like a dream. I always tried to make my writing a means of escape. Something to do when life was hard. But in this place? Nothings ever really wrong. It just...is. After all, death is the ultimate escape right?\u201d \n\n\u201cHow very bleak.\u201d Leonardo slurred, his face resting in the palm of his hand. Sokratis elbowed him and motioned for Allen to continue. \n\n\u201cWho\u2019s gonna read what I write here? People come and go. This place is always changing. I suppose I feel like I would just be writing for myself.\u201d Allen finished weakly. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d done a very good job of explaining himself. Sokratis had a knowing look about him.\n\n\u201cIs there anything wrong with that?\u201d The old man asked. \n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Allen replied. \u201cBut, it\u2019s not really something I\u2019m interested in.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you want your work to be experienced by others.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there anything wrong with that?\u201d Allen repeated the old man\u2019s question. Sokratis smiled again.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He set his cigar down on the ashtray and leaned forward, his arms resting on the table. \u201cHave you ever wondered happens to the people when they leave here?\u201d\n\nAllen shrugged again. Sure he\u2019d had the thought occasionally, but he never really knew if people truly left this place, or were simply shuffled around along with the city. Though now that Sokratis had asked him, he wondered. \n\n\u201cI do. All the time.\u201d Sokratis answered his own question. \u201cI wonder how we are here when our bodies have long ago turned to dust in a place that is far away from here. \u201cI wonder why the city shifts and changes, seemingly without pattern.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the last time there *IS* a pattern!\u201d Leonardo snarled, \u201cI just haven\u2019t found it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder why time seems to flow erratically. I wonder why this place seems to dull our minds with apathy.\u201d Sokratis continued as if he hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cAnd most of all, I wonder, is any of this real?\u201d \n\nAllen blinked. These were all questions he\u2019d vaguely considered before, but at the same time never seriously. It was like he\u2019d been walking into a wall, but hadn\u2019t seen it until Sokratis pointed it out. There was a tingle in the back of his mind. A spark of, something. He opened his mouth to say something, but he didn\u2019t know what. Thankfully, Sokratis spoke fist, sitting back in his chair and retrieving his cigar. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll read what you write.\u201d He said simply. Allen blinked. Out of everything he\u2019d heard today, that was most confusing to him. \n\n\u201cYou will?\u201d\n\n\u201cDear boy I\u2019ve been here over two thousand years. I would love something new to read.\u201d\n\nAgain Allen opened his mouth to respond, and again he was cut off. This time by Thales, who appeared at the table, plucking Allens empty glass from his hands.\n\n\u201cSorry boys, closing up early tonight.\u201d Thanes said. Abraham nodded.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get out of your hair. Thank you Thanes.\u201d He said. \n\n\u201cJust make sure this one finds his way home.\u201d Thanes winked, jabbing his thumb at Leonardo, who muttered into his palm.\n\n\u201cThere is a pattern. I know it. I know it.\u201d\n\nSokratis turned back towards Allen, ashing his cigar. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here same time next week. We\u2019d love for you to join us again. And if you have something written by then, I\u2019d like to see it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs would I.\u201d Abraham added, lifting his glass towards him. \n\nAllen left the Thales\u2019 Bar shortly after. He stepped out onto the mostly empty street. The city had shifted again, like usual. He wondered if Leonardo was right, and there really was a pattern to it\u2019s changes. He didn\u2019t know if it was possible to try and map out the afterlife, but he was surprised to find himself curious as to the possibility. \n\nOne week. He would have to start keeping track of the days. He had a goal now, and a deadline. Funny, it was almost like being alive again. Only it wasn\u2019t. It was a different existence, being here, but for the first time he found he wasn\u2019t satisfied with simply loosing himself to the afterlife. \n\nHe wanted more.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nThank you for reading!

            "comment": "I really imagined dying to be a more spectacular or dramatic thing. For all I know, I fell asleep one evening and woke up on this hill. Maybe I was just dreaming, but some thought in the back of my head, clearer than any thought I ever had, told me I was dead. Just as I wanted to take in the strange landscape for a second a shout from right behind suprised me:\u201dLook, a new fella!\u201d I turned around and couldn\u00b4t believe my eyes: Was that Einstein? Before I could think any further he grabbed me by the shoulder and started walking while chatting in the most cheerful way:\u201dI know what you want to ask, yes I\u00b4m Einstein and all this here is...well... some sort of afterlife or purgatory, and we are probably stuck here until our name is said for the last time, atleast that\u00b4s what Sokrates thinks. But let\u00b4s go faster, you still have to see a lot!\u201d Stuck in an afterlife with all famous souls? Great! But what was I doing here? I mean, I was just an average scientist that published some papers about stem cell research...wait...maybe this one thing was more important than I thought... Einstein interrupted me again:\u201cSee, that guy over there under the tree, that\u00b4s my friend Newton! He still sits there everyday, thinking he\u00b4ll come up with something great. HEEY NEWTON! We already discovered gravity, no reason to sit there anymore!\u201d His positive energy seemed to flow into me; I didn\u00b4t resist. Newton defied his own theory by not reacting at all to Einsteins words.  I realized some other, very slim person was sitting under the tree aswell:\u201d Who is that?\u201d, I asked. \u201cAh, that\u00b4s just Buddha.\u201d \u201cReally? I always imagined him to be... you know a little bit fatter, like in the sculptures.\u201d Einstein laughed out loud:\u201dThere\u00b4s no time for eating when you meditate all day. Well, he isn\u00b4t very talkative anyway. Hasn\u00b4t moved one inch since I came here.\u201d \u201cWait, not one inch?\u201d This place seemed to hold an endless amount of suprises. \u201cYup. No one really knows how long he was here, but King Arthur said he was already there when he came.\u201d \u201cWait, King Arthur was real?\u201d Einstein just nodded, as if it was the most normal thing in the world. Suddenly, a familiar looking old man that I couldn\u00b4t quite identify came rushing towards us, carefully trying not to spill whatever was in the in the 2 glasses he was holding. \u201cCome on, Einstein, don\u00b4t keep him all to yourself!\u201d He raised his hand, and in doing so dropped one of the glasses he was holding. Looking at his sad face I finally got it: It was Hemingway! A very, very drunk Hemingway. I shook his hand and he offered the remaining drink to me:\u201d Care for a martini? Don\u00b4t tell Nietzsche though, he always gets mad when he sees us drinking!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n// I just couldn\u00b4t think of all those poor souls waiting to die, so I decided to make a comedy out of it. Truly fun to write, thank you for the inspiration. Might write another part, but at the moment I just can\u00b4t think of any more references to throw into the story. //",

For the dead-never-forgotten grieve the same connection living people desire... a transcending love ready to explode with confetti and bright vivid colours when it dies holding each other's hands.\n\neverything was limitless, everything was free, everyone passed around..\n\nNietzche was sitting down writing with a pointed stone upon a rock\n\n*\" Trudy, i scowl at the lives who forgot all about you, who could forget the girl who broke my heart? my heart suffers for your love, i'll never keep it hidden, it's been so long, upon this rock, wishing it was before today, before forever started, wishing it was the forever many forevers ago when i met you...\"*\n\n\\-\n\nTrudy was wearing a silk-sky blue dress when she faded, she was looking over the same rock nieztche sits forevers ahead. Forever then nietzche held her hand tightly, trudy fixed her hair looked at nietzche and said *\"Darling you have to let go of me now\"*. *\"What if you never come back?\"* said nietzche worried, like a child, *\"Then it'll finally be my time to go\", i'm not as popular as you my love, i was only a small girl when i died, my parents died many years ago, remember? i said goodbye to them today\". \"It's always today\"* said nieztche miserably *\"a night never comes by, can't you stay with me for a little longer?\",* trudy laughed and held his face with her hand *\"My sweet, you'll never get used to this will you?  you still speak like it's the year you died, you still say things like 'little longer' while time doesn't come here, friedich you'll always be human won't you?\"* she smiled so brightly, looking at her old soulmate, caressing his cheek with her only free hand *\"Let me hold your face with my own two hands, let me touch your hair and feel your lips with my fingertips..\"* she kissed him on the cheek *\"But i'll never see you again, i can't be alone anymore\"* said nietzche.\n\n\\-\n\nForever now nitzche stood up from his lonely rock and looked down at the ocean, not clashing, not moving, forever static.

Anyway, I took a glance around the room to see if I recognized anyone, to my surprise, I saw Albert Einstien along with many famous physists all dicussing some topic I didn\u02bbt understand. I decided that I did not want to impede on their converstion, so I glanced at more people in the room. There were everyday men and women who sat uneasily near a large set of doors, there was Beethoven and Bach, there was Shakespear, and off in the way back, far from any other table, sat Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin.",

            "comment": "The security line in Terminal A  of LaGuardia International Airport, I knew the place, it\u2019s smell, it\u2019s awful late twentieth century chrome and slightly yellow decor. In all my decades of travel I had probably spent more time in this airport than any other.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in hell, I must be, and it\u2019s cold.\u201d I muttered to myself as the security agent beckoned me over. \u201cWe could at least have done Newark.\u201d\n\n I looked down at my sleeves and tugged on my lapel. I was wearing a cheap grey suit. It the first suit I\u2019d ever had tailored and a significant upgrade from the hospital gown I had just been in. I glanced around, no suitcase, nothing, not even a book. Hell was cold indeed. \n\n\u201cWelcome, let\u2019s just see how long before you move out,\u201d the security agent punched on her computer. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name and year of birth?\u201d \n\n\u201cAlexander Samuels, 1987\u201d I read her name tag a habit from life, something I did with all security agents incase I needed to complain or attempt to assert some sort of authority and call a supervisor.\n\n\u201cCan you be anymore specific? I have seven of you born that year in America. Can we nail it down a bit more. You are American yes? Can you give me a place of birth?\u201d\n\nI nodded and continued to stare at the badge. Amelia Earhart. The Amelia Earhart. An afterlife TSA agent? No. What!? I pointed at the badge. I had seen her picture probably a thousand times growing up and there she was standing in front of me. \n\n\u201cYes. O.K. It\u2019s fine you can stop staring. You found me like everyone else eventually does. Now, please Mr. Samuels place of origin?\u201d\n\n\u201cNew York,\u201d I finally blurted. \n\n\u201cAh here, it seems you have two books published, sold moderately well. No military history, nothing else of note. You\u2019re looking at 200 years, you can get your boarding pass at gate 19.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d I stepped passed the security checkpoint. There was no metal detector, x-ray belt or body scanner. Just the concourse with hundreds of gates. I looked back.\n\n\u201cOh you\u2019re stuck here in purgatory until you are forgotten. Depending on the longevity of the internet you have about a 200 year wait. Good luck. Your lucky why do you think I found myself a job. You should probably find one too. The computer is usually wrong.\u201d She waved me passed.\n\nI sat down at the gate. 200 years, the words echoed in my mind. I was only alive for 63 years. Buried my head in my hands trying to wipe the scene away.\n\n\u201cNew guy.\u201d \n\nI looked up and vaguely recognized the face. \n\n\u201cName\u2019s Lenny Bruce, \u201d he sat down next to me. \u201cHow long you here for?\u201d\n \nI stared at him through my fingers.\n\n\u201cThat long? What\u2019d you do? Artist, actor.\u201d He paused. \u201cAuthor?\u201d\n\nI pointed a finger in response.\n\n\u201cThat sucks. You\u2019re in print and what is it? Electronic now?\u201d \n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cShort of an apocalypse you ain\u2019t never leaving. They give you a cigarette? They used to give everyone cigarettes. I\u2019ve been dying for a cigarette for about a century now.\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \n\n\u201cListen maybe if your lucky you\u2019ll get mistranslated. You should hear Socrates and Plato bitch about the apostles and how quickly they got out. Less than five centuries and all the names dates and places, translated, retranslated and mistranslated and so messed up no one remembered them at all and boom out. Of course, that was all before the printing press.\u201d\n\nHe stood up and straightened his blazer. \n\n\u201cHell, even I was almost out. Then I ended up as a friend to some fictional character in some hit TV show that wasn\u2019t even on TV. That was several decades ago and now here we are. But hey, tonight, the original cast of Saturday Night Live is going to be doing a bit in Julia Child\u2019s restaurant next to gate 52. You should check it out.\u201d \n\nI leaned back a stared up at the awful fluorescent yellow lights. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry the shock will wear off soon. When it does see if management\u2019ll get you a job here. They are trying to phase out some of the ancients from the bars.\u201d\n",

It's in a collection of 40 stories of different possibilities for what the afterlife holds. The book is called \"Sum\" and it's one of my all-time favourites. I even have a spare copy so that I can lend it to people without worrying about losing it!",

The pooling of blood, the dimming of the sky and the last desperate gasps all receded. As she stood there she tried to recall it, hold onto those last memories of life. But they became veiled far more quickly than she had thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd Alex saw, in the middle of the vastness of the afterlife, dim and grey at first but clearer and clearer with each passing moment sat millions of faces. There were a sea of them, almost evenly spaced, all stretched on a carpet of perfect grass under a grey sky. They were all sitting, standing, laying, reclining. Every so often someone would shift position, stretching or moving, but not a single one got up. Alex was the only one standing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd suddenly, without warning she heard a voice, vaguely familiar.\n\n\"Alex?\" it called across the moving, shifting sea of people. \"Alex! Alex! We have been waiting for you!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlex searched through the dim foggy grey memories, shifting the voice, comparing it. She turned her head from side to side searching and she saw, in the distance a woman standing, a thin, familiar outline.\n\nAnother voice called, this time a Man's voice and she saw him rise to his feet and join the woman. \"Alex!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then she remembered, and a wave of familiarity washed over her.\n\n\"Mom? Dad?!\" she cried, and she began to step over the people waiting on the grass, jumping over them or stepping around them. Her movement through the crowd barely registered on their faces. Some lazily lolled aside but most she simply had to navigate around.\n\nHer parents folded her into their arms, strong and sweet, and smelling of home and childhood and memory.\n\n\"Alex, we've waited so long for you to show up here, and we have missed you with every single piece of our hearts. But Alex, we have loved these years, too, because each year here for us was a year of joy and life and the promise of living for you. We would have been content to wait here in eternity for you if it meant you could live forever. But we have waited for you, too. And you will also learn to love these waiting years.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd just like that her parents gently released her from their arms and walked off farther and farther into the moving sea of people, until they were so far in the distance they were tiny dots, and then nothing. And Alex sat down in the grass where they had been and began to wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "they just sat around saying nothing. so did I, I suppose. there is no one living to listen to us. Our bile is spewn forth with the gusto of an asthmatic spewing phlegm.  We cling to life as if it is our breath. its funny some old Greek man at least i think hes Greek thinks breath is life. I suppose it is our life. for if you do not breath my name I am gone and forsaken. Yet I know there is something else. we may continue to debate and argue and earth? it continues to spin. the essence of life is  thought. The process of finding a solution. its what we have all done. its what THEY will continue to do. I myself I will find a new way of thinking. I believe this purgatory only exists for those who will not listen, those who think our cause doomed. we are more than the death of thought. we are those who think.",

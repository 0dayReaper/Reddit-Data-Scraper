            "comment": "My mind has always played jokes on me, but this is too much.\n\nI've long been in the habit of finding reasonable explanations for the way the world coincides with my inner life. But this defies explanation.\n\nI rifle through the envelope. There's a thousand dollars in twenties. My name is scrawled in childish letters on the front.\n\n\"So this is what the space inside my mind is worth. One of those things you think is priceless, but nothing is. A thousand isn't too bad though.\"\n\nI look around my messy office, quiet but for the creak of floorboards in the apartment overhead. Dust motes dance in rays of sunlight that land across my oak flat top desk. One of the few things from my parents' house I wanted to keep.\n\n\"How'd you get it in here, then?\"\n\nNothing. He comes and goes - a ramblin' man. Sometimes I imagine there's a railway network between the brains of the world, and I've got a stop near a hobo camp where the crazies like to hop off. \n\nA thousand bucks. I could get into trouble with a thousand bucks. I slap the envelope across my palm a couple of times, almost heading for the door. I pull out five twenties, shove them in my front pocket, and throw the envelope in the safe in my closet.\n\nSomeone is banging on the door. My heart picks up a bit. Through the peephole I see the fisheye distortion of the neighbor kid Lucy. I open the door.\n\n\"What's up, kiddo?\"\n\n\"Who's the guy who was here earlier? Why does he have a key to your apartment?\"\n\nI knew it. I knew I wasn't crazy this time. It's hard to understand if you aren't crazy yourself, but an explanation that makes sense is better than no explanation - even if it means someone broke into your house, apparently with no other purpose than to leave you a thousand dollars. Which has no other explanation other than a thought you had earlier. The real explanation is there, somewhere. You can find it later. But this is a good start.\n\n\"He's, uh, my uncle. He was just feeding my fish for me.\"\n\n\"You don't have a fish.\"\n\n\"I got one.\"\n\nLucy scowls at me. She knows I'm almost always full of shit, so she almost always regards me with the same chronic skepticism usually reserved for known liars and problem children. \n\n\"Well whatever you're getting into, stay safe, okay?\" She whirls around, her long, straight black hair making a disc around her head for a moment before she runs down the hall.\n\nI head out the front of my building, texting as I go. I let my guy know I need to meet him. He's always happy to grab coffee any time of the day or night.\n\nWe slip into a booth at Jack's Old Fashion'd Diner. In my head, to me, it's \"Jack's Unnecessary Apostrophe Diner.\" Private jokes are a little more fun when the voices in your head chuckle with you, but not by much.\n\nMy guy has messy brown hair and snake green eyes. His white t-shirt is loose and semi-wrinkled like he slept in it. He probably did.\n\n\"So you come into some money, or what? What's with the house call?\"\n\nI never correct his haphazard speech. It seems like his mind is always catching up to where and when his body is.\n\n\"Something like that.\" I say.\n\nHe smirks. \"So you sure you only want that amount? I can provide a longer supply...\"\n\n\"I'm good with what I asked for. What, you tired of seeing me or somethin'?\"\n\nHe takes a quick look around the restaurant, moves his hand near his coffee cup on a saucer, then slides it towards me. I pick it up, pour in some creamer, then push it back to him. He smiles and puts his hand in his pocket.\n\n\"You're getting better.\" he grins. Gulping the rest of the coffee, he slides out of the booth. \"And you're finally learning just the right amount of cream. It's a finesse game, you know. An art.\"\n\nI raise my eyebrows in a kind of \"yeah, uh-huh\" gesture. But he's already gone.\n\nLook, it's nothing crazy, okay? Self-medication kind of becomes necessary when you're in my position. Insurance doesn't cover the anti-psychotics my doctor wants me on. These are pretty close and they're half the price.\n\nI cut through the park on the way back to my place, crunching the pills and thinking about the man in my apartment. At times my life has become a blur of my mental projections and my reality, people coming and going, people I half-know and some, who after spending nights and days with, seem like the most real thing I know, turn out in the morning to only have been a fever dream, barely remembered.\n\nHo boy. They're kicking in know. The grass in the park turns blurry, green blur, and things smooth out. The sky is a crystal. I can see past the atmosphere.\n\nGreen is good. That's it. I'll try to remember. Revelations, revelations! They come. The time comes, and I feel it, and I know it, but to remember, ah. That is the thing. The thing which I grasp, yet not fully, yet oh the sky. Madness.\n\nCooly I walk, cooly. No time for a rest, a spell. Who now is this dark figure, this devil beside me? I sit. A half-stand. Beside me on the bench. Who?\n\n*Are you okay there, friend?*\n\nHe speaks from underwater - a merman. A sea creature. from the night of the world.\n\n*You're swimming in a narcotic sea, aren't you, pal?*\n\n\"My mind reaches... and takes. And beholds.\"\n\n*But you see me, don't you?*\n\nA sharp change. a turn in the wind. felt but not seen. The man - the sea creature.  i behold him now. no, not a stranger. a known person. a quantity. a memory. a voice.\n\n*I trust you found my first month's.*\n\na shiver. a remembrance. money in a narrow paper box, a gift, a strange thing in a strange place. rent.\n\n\"My benefactor!\"\n\ni rise. i stand. the dark figure beside, he sits. a disk of flesh color spinning in place. \n\nThe world becomes clear in phases. A flash here, and return to madness. I call this phasing. Far from frustration, the contrast makes the high even better. Sometimes I just want to get lost. But sometimes it's nice to see the world in two ways. Flicking the light switch.\n\nNow I see the man, dark suit and bowler hat. Old-timey, square jaw and flint eyes. Thick eyebrows. Well-kept. The kind of guy who looks like he'd smack is wife if his dinner wasn't hot at 5 o'clock sharp. A mean guy.\n\n*Just need to get a breath of fresh air, now and then. You get to be cooped up after a while.*\n\nA voice, yes. A body, no. Where the line is drawn, I never know. See this? The uncertainty? How can someone ever drive a stake in the ground, pull a string taught from it, and draw a circle, and say that within this is what I know? In a manner of speaking, of course. That's just it. No way to know what works, what is real, what is acknowledged. What can be known for sure.\n\n*I quite enjoy the room, you know. It's got some view. It's like going to the movies and seeing the character descend into madness. But I don't need to do it myself, you know? Living vicariously through people whose lives we don't want. That's the new American Dream, you know. It's too hard to actually do it. But experiencing it? That's easy.*\n\ni swim. i swim through air, sea of nothing fog. then i am in my bed, and time commences to discommence. i enter void and days go, hours go. sometimes shafts of light, sometimes shafts of night. but always moonlight, only positive or negative. my fish is dead. i held ceremony, sang sweet elegy to his name. Martin. Martin i called him. pain gnaws in the middle of me and i am missing something. the cosmos swirl and i am of it. the buzz. the hum of time and ratcheting gears of things i must remember. i must. i must...\n\nAwake. Sunlight. Thirsty. Hungry. Adjectives and nouns come one by one. I know it's the end of a bender. Pharmaceuticals mixed with mental illness can send you on a journey. Only afterwords do you decide if it was a trip worth taking.\n\nThere's a cold bowl of soup next to my bed and slippers on the floor, ready to slip my feet into. A card draw in crayon propped up behind the soup. A picture of a goldfish with letter x's for eyes. Inside: \"Sorry about Martin.\"\n\nI come back to life, slowly, attend to my human needs. Bathroom. Food. A shower has never felt so glorious.\n\nWhen I am fully alive again, I go to my desk to write, hopefully, while I still have the clarity for it. I go to sit down, and stop in half-crouch.\n\nAn envelope is on the corner of my desk. Shaking, I look inside.\n\nTwo thousand dollars, and a scrawled note:\n\n*Sorry about the mess.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHey there!

Not unlike a parent, it is his responsibility, now, to understand and allow for mistakes to happen. See - the voice has made his, and understands that all young people will. The drugs, the lack of structure, everything can be forgiven - such is the power of youth.\n\nSo how can the voice make amends? The money is a start, he thinks, but his wife *may* notice, although she's generally not privy to the financial situation. And it hurts his feelings that the man thinks that he hits his wife. Not the voice's fault he is dressed old fashioned. So, he thinks, an introduction over time may be necessary, and just to see how it all unfolds.",

Does it earn the money somehow? Teleport it from somewhere? Create it? Making fakes is VERY hard for humans, I can't imagine it would be easier for a creature not even from this world, so whatever it is seems to at least have a good enough understanding of what money is to understand that you can't just manufacture something that looks vaguely like money.\n\nDoes he just have a roommate and this is how he perceives him, is he used by rich people with fancy mindriding technology and one of them took pity on him, or is he inhabited by something completely out of our frame of reference?\n\nEither way, they're very interesting concepts to explore!",

            "comment": "Two hundred pounds sat patiently in a manilla envelope on a bedside table, until Richard Bankwest awoke and shook them out. His name was scrawled across the front of the envelope in an unfamiliar hand. The handwriting was poor. Childlike, Richard thought.\n\nWhere had it come from? He hadn't the foggiest. There was no note attached. No real explanation. Did someone owe him money? Not that he could recall. \n\nHe put the money in a cabinet, in case the rightful owner came looking for it, perhaps realising their mistake. Then, he all but forgot about the event -- and the money -- for almost an entire month after.\n\nJanuary passed, as it always did for Richard: the English winter stretching interminably, like a sheet of ice suffocating the ocean, until eventually swallowed by the horizon. He worked. It was at a call centre, and it wasn't a job he liked. Elderly people would ring up and ask if they'd qualified for this money or for that money, and Richard would tell them no, and that they couldn't have any government assistance, and then they'd get upset. \n\nOr angry. \n\nIt was easier to dismiss the angry callers. The sad ones... they stayed with him for at least the day, sometimes creeping into his nights, too. It wasn't that he cared. He didn't. But they barged into his dreams like unwelcome family when trying to watch the football.\n\nA new colleague offered him something to help him with the dreams. With the stress. \n\nHe refused politely. \n\nThere was only one other strange incident in February. One event that was a tiny bit unusual for Richard.\n\nHe'd lost a day. \n\nAn *entire* day.\n\nHe'd taken it as annual leave, apparently. That's what the computer told him. And yet... he couldn't remember booking it, or what he even did with it. Although... his arm was sore for the two days after, as if he'd slept on it funny.\n\nStill, in a life as uneventful and lonely as Richard's, a lost day was neither here nor there. He could lose them all, for all he cared. And so, he went back to his phone and picked up the receiver, and listened to another elderly person drone on about how cold it was this winter, and how they couldn't afford to put the heating on. Listen to them beg for help that he couldn't give and didn't want to.\n\nIt was the start of February when he found another manilla envelope resting next to his bed. He took first a gulp, then his time, then the envelope, and finally another gulp as he tore it open and the money drifted out of the envelope like autumn leaves. Eight hundred this time -- and with it, a note.\n\n&gt; Richard. Had a blast last month, so I'm going to take it for an entire week. You kept me locked up for far too long, friend. If you can't enjoy life, someone else might as well! \n\nHe placed the money with the rest of his bizarrely gained fortune, inside his bedside cabinet. *Might get a dragon try to roost in it, if I get any more of these envelopes*, he thought dryly. Dismissively. \n\nFebruary however, passed a little differently January. \n\nMainly because there was *less of it.*\n\nNow, even in Richard's world, where a lost day could be accepted like a penny dropped on the floor that's not worth one's time to retrieve, a lost week (plus a heavy suntan, and a tattoo of koala on his bicep) could not be. \n\nSomething was going wrong in Richard's head, and he knew it.\n\nSo he told the doctor.\n\nThe doctor said he was suffering from stress. That his subconscious wanted to get away from all the grey. It wanted to shine a rainbow of colour into his life. That he mustn't worry. He was still in charge.\n\nHe told the doctor about the note he'd found.\n\nThe doctor didn't roll his eyes, but the rest of his expression matched that of a person who desperately *wanted* to roll his eyes.\n\n\nIt was the last day of February (night time, in fact) and Richard was an electric ball of very human nerves. He scrawled a desperate letter and placed it on his bedside table, begging this body snatching Santa to take pity on him.\n\n&gt; I don't care for your money. Please stop taking my body. It's *mine*.  \n\nThe whiskey helped him sleep. Eventually.\n\nThe note he found in the morning made him pick up the bottle again.\n\n&gt; You don't take care of yourself, Richard. You certainly don't make the most of your life. I'm taking two weeks this month. I have given you two thousand pounds for two weeks. That is far more than your life is worth, I think you'll agree. Quit your job, and enjoy the two weeks every month. If you do not... well, this is your last chance to live, Richard.\n\nHe called in sick that morning, as he held the phone to his ear with one trembling hand, and the whiskey bottle in another. He blacked out two hours later. \n\nIt was Valentine's day when he awoke. \n\nDrugs. There were drugs in his apartment. Clear, plastic bags full of white powder. Had... had he bought them? He couldn't have. It must be this... *other* him.\n\nHe flushed them down the toilet as best he could, the powder misting the room and reddening his eyes.\n\nHe staggered into work, pale and thin and with two more tattoos to his name. He begged for his job back -- apparently he'd quite thirteen days ago. \n\nIt was reluctantly granted. His boss hated to see grown men crying.\n\nRichard found it a relief to sit back down in his booth and answer the calls he'd used to hate. For the first time in a long time, he even tried *helping* the caller. Giving other numbers to call for advice and such. \n\nFor the first time he could remember, he cared about something.\n\nThe next two weeks he *did* remember, even if they were a white haze of doctors and psychiatrists at the weekends, of work and precipitation drugs during the days, and of alcohol and cigarettes during the nights. \n\nIt was the end of March, when he scribbled his final note, in a hand that looked as if it had been written during an earthquake.\n\n&gt; Please. I want my life back. I love life, even if maybe sometimes I don't -- didn't -- fully appreciate. But I'll start dating -- I signed up to a website last week! I'll join a gym soon, too. It's *my* life. Please, give it back.\n\nThen blackness.\n\nThen eight hours later, light.\n\n&gt; *No.*\n\nThere was no money this time. Nothing.\n\nRichard happened to glance at the clock. It was almost midnight. \n\nThen he saw the date.\n\nApril the thirtieth.\n\nHe began to cry, his lips trembling, until they didn't. \n\nUntil they struck a switch-blade smile. \n\nUntil his eyes shone and his body took a deep, relaxing breath. \n\n\n\n",

The person who'd done it hadn't bothered to lick the little adhesive or whatever to lick it. I knew I wasn't the only one who hated those. \n\nBut I knew, *knew* like I knew the sky was blue what I would find inside there. Trembling, I lifted the flap and peered inside. \n\nCash. \n\nI went to take the bills out, but I dropped the envelope on the floor, and the bills spilled on the floor. A dozen Benjamins stared at me, their eyes somehow accusing. \n\n\"Satisfied?\"\n\nI whirled around, expecting to find someone there, but there's no one - just my trashy one-room apartment. \n\n\"In your head, dolt. Jesus Christ, mate, you'd think you would've gotten used to it by now.\"\n\nI didn't need to speak to it, or even think in sentences to it. As soon as a thought formed, it knew. \n\n\"None of your damn business how I got it, mate,\" the voice said again. \"You got your money, yeah? Stay happy.\" \n\nThinking again. \n\nThis time the voice laughs - it is a grating noise inside my ears, hostile, unnatural. \"Who did I possess? Are you kiddin' me right now, mate?\"\n\nMy heart started beating louder. \n\nI put on some flip flops and practically ran out of the apartment. I took the elevator to the bottom of the building, and nodded to Carl, the security guard. \n\n\"Carl,\" I said in the way way of greeting. \n\nCarl waved his donut at me. \n\n\"Did someone enter the building after me?\" I asked. \n\nCarl frowned but shook his head. \"Nah, man. You came in from your night shift as usual, then you left again in the middle of the damn night, and then you came back like two hours ago. No one else came in or out.\" He blew air out of his nose. \"You got a weird schedule man.\"\n\nIt took all my self control to smile back, and slowly, deliberately, step back in the elevator, with that same mocking laugh bouncing around in my head as I did.

I can't say I was expecting you to pay up.\"\n\n\"Honestly Paul, we've known each other for *how* many years?\"\n\nPaul couldn't stop looking at the envelope. It had a green stripe printed down the right side and a plastic window pane in the bottom left. Looking closer at the window on the envelope, Paul could read \"First Security Bank\".\n\n*Aren't they just down the street?*, thought Paul.\n\n\"They *are* just down the street,\" said the voice, \"Looks like you won't be needing to work for a while. Put your feet up, Paul! Enjoy unemployment while you still have it.\"\n\nPaul began carefully tearing the top of the envelope open. \"Well how much is in it?\"\n\n\"See for yourself!\"\n\nPaul dumped out the contents of the envelope on the kitchen counter. Countless dollar bills flooded the surface of the counter.\n\n\"Are these real- are these REALLY ALL HUNDREDS?\" Paul started sweating.\n\n\"That's $13,000 Papa Paul. It's time for you and me to finally relax a bit.\" Paul could hear the sound of a recliner leaning back. \"Go make yourself a cocktail, Paul, you deserve it.\"\n\nPaul could immediately hear the sound of an ocean. Waves crashed against a sandy shore. Paul could hear footsteps on the sand.\n\n\"Your drink Mr. V,\" said a female voice.\n\n\"Your name is Mr. V, now?\" said Paul with a smirk.\n\n\"It's V for Voice. I'm your voice, Paul. I say the things you sometimes don't wanna hear, but you know they're true.\"\n\nPaul could hear the sound of Mr. V sipping on a cocktail. The sound of ice clanking against the glass made Paul's mouth begin to water.\n\n\"I suppose you're right.\" Paul gently gathered up his money and sorted it by thousands. Sure enough, Mr. V was right - $13,000 exactly.\n\n\"And when am I ever wrong?\" asked Mr. V.\n\nPaul gave an embarrassed laugh. \"I forget how useful you are sometimes.\"\n\n\"Ahh, don't worry about it. I don't wanna hear it. You better go pay your rent - it's almost 8 o'clock.\" Mr. V took another sip of his cocktail.\n\nPaul glanced at the clock on his stove - 7:49pm. He quickly counted out four hundred, stashed it away in his jacket pocket, and left. Paul made his way down the stone pathway towards the quaint apartment office. Paul never felt so relieved to be walking to the office with money. He couldn't remember the last time went there without being on the brink of a panic attack. Last month's rent was a close call if it wasn't for that unemployment check.\n\nA hanging bell rang as Paul walked through the front door.\n\nAn stern-faced woman with half moon glasses looked up from counting money. \"Hello Mr. Shavver, cutting it close again are we?\"\n\nPaul smiled, \"Don't worry Mrs. Moore, I come prepared this time.\"\n\nPaul reached in his pocket for the money, and felt nothing.",

Rubbish nickname, don't use it.\"\n\n\"Shut up.\" The man put his knife down and walked to his living room where he fell into his armchair, sighing and placing a hand over his eyes.\n\n\"Alright. No need to get so worked up.\"\n\n\"Alright that's it, onion shredder, whatever. If you want to live here, how bout you start paying some rent. At least that's somewhat useful.\"\n\n\"I am useful! And I told you not to call me onion shredder.\" The voice sounded almost indignant.\n\n\"Whatever. I'm going to bed, and I'll just eat a larger breakfast tomorrow.\" The man stood up and strode to his bedroom, the voice oddly silent.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nImpossible. There it was, an envelope brimming with cash. He took it and counted it. Five thousand dollars.\n\n\"What the hell?\"\n\n\"Is that enough?\" The voice asked. \"I'm not sure about it. Had to sell my saliva collection to pay for it, but eh, I like it here.

I spent money on mental health checkups!\" The man yelled at the empty room.\n\n\"Oof. Sorry to break it to you, but you are still schizophrenic. I probably worsened the thing, but hey, the rent covers it, right?\"\n\n\"I swear I am going to beat the shit out of you if I ever get my hands on you.\" The man spun around a few times.\n\n\"Hey, hey, you told me I could stay if I paid rent.\"\n\n\"I was joking!\"\n\n\"Wow. Can you hear anyone laughing?\"\n\n\"Wait, so alternate dimensions are real?\"\n\n\"Yes, our side knew about it for ages. My kindergarten thesis was on the correlation between the bridges to this dimension and the amount of French cheese in the surrounding area. Failed, but I like to think the teacher just loved French cheese too much.\"\n\n\"Oh dear lord. Do I have to put up with you all year long?\"\n\n\"No, don't worry about that, I got an hour away from here every month, so not all year long.\"\n\nThe man imagined the onion shredder having a cheeky smile on its face. He sighed.\n\n\"Alright, don't be too annoying, and when I say shut up, shut up.\"\n\n\"I am not annoying. I like to think I've been a positive influence in your life.\"\n\n\"Really?\" The man said, sarcasm dripping from his words.\n\n\"Yes! Remember your stunt in the storeroom last month? I pulled the offending stool out of the way, and you didn't hurt your foot!\"\n\n\"I fell off and hurt my back, you bloody idiot!\"\n\n\"And I knew you got tired of kids kicking footballs at your window, so I installed a 50,000 volt perimeter defense system within five meters of your house!\"\n\n\"What? That's gotta break every safety regulation in the damn country!\"\n\n\"No, only 85% of them, trust me I checked. And, I knew you got tired of your neighbour's car honking every morning, so I sent him and his ugly car into the shadow realm!\"\n\n\"You did? Alright, we need to break out the bottles of beer and celebrate!\" he started walking to the kitchen\n\n\"Yeah, about that.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I noticed your alcohol problem and decided to donate your stash to the Alcoholics Anonymous. They like beer right? They got alcohol in the name.\"\n\nThe man thought back to the explosions last week.\n\nHe facepalmed.\n\n[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7uyxhp/wp_a_schizophrenic_man_gets_sick_of_the_voice_in/dtpiag1/)",

Do you know what rent is?\u201d He starts to become sarcastic, even condescending. \u201cRent is that thing you pay to let you have a roof over your head and to keep you safe.\u201d\n\nAfter doing another line of values in his spreadsheet, he pauses,  yelling at the voices. \u201cIf you want to live here, or in my head, you might as well start paying some damn rent!\u201d\n\nFeeling a little bit better, he takes the quiet to mean he can go back to work, only scratching his arms occasionally. He mumbles the numbers aloud as he types them, unsettled by the near-silence.\n\nHe zones out, typing the numbers almost on autopilot. When he finishes the last line, he hears a familiar female voice, one he knew instinctively was named Leah.\n\nShe steps up close behind him, her caramel skin contrasting with his pale neck as she rests her hand on his shoulder. In the reflection of the monitor, she\u2019s not there, though. \u201cCome on, David, you need to go to bed. If you stay up too late, it\u2019ll just get worse.\u201d\n\nHe hears the jingle of her bangles, the sound of her arm rubbing against her dress as she lifts it to tuck her hair behind her ear, but in the reflection, he\u2019s just staring at himself.\n\nShaking his head, he logs out of the computer, turning its screen off. He smiles at Leah, taking her hand as he walks into his room and sits down on the bed. She smiles at him, moving quickly to the other side of the bed. He shuffles down, getting into the right position and curling up to her. He wraps an arm around her, nuzzling his face into her hair as he starts to fall asleep.\n\nIn the morning, he wakes to his alarm and the voices screaming, his head pounding, eyes heavy, and him still feeling half-asleep. He looks at the clock, then hits the button to turn it off, climbing quickly out of bed and rushing into his bathroom to pee.\n\nWhile standing there, he notices an unfamiliar voice whispering, or at least incredibly quiet, under the screams. Ignoring it the best he can, David finishes up, washing his hands as the toilet flushes.\n\nHe picks up his glasses from the bedside table, unsure of when he\u2019d taken them off the night before, but glad they\u2019re in one piece regardless. He pushes them up his nose, catching a glimpse of his wild eyes, rimmed with bags from being exhausted, staring back.\n\nIgnoring that too, he walks back into the living room, planning on polishing the report before sending it off. Before he can even sit fully, though, he notices a letter, addressed with his name in calligraphy no less, resting on his keyboard. Using a nail, he pulls back the flap of the envelope, surprising himself when it flips up easily. What falls out, though, isn\u2019t a letter, but bills of various denominations.\n\nHe grabs them all, noticing it says something on the flap of the envelope. He turns it, reading, \u201cRENT\u201d in neat handwriting.\n\nIf he hadn\u2019t remembered snapping at the voices, he\u2019d be confused and maybe even laugh. But instead, he clenches his jaw, starting to count out the money.\n\n\u201cOne\u2026 two\u2026 three\u2026 eight\u2026 ten\u2026 twenty\u2026 thirty\u2026 fifty\u2026 one hundred\u2026\u201d He trails off, mouthing the numbers instead.\n\nShuffling the money through, he counts again and again until he finally accepts that there\u2019s at least two months rent in the envelope.\n\nThe voice he\u2019d heard under all the screaming laughs, amused at his discomfort but still too quiet to be heard properly. From what David can tell, it sounds like an older man, but it could be almost anything at this point.\n\nHe stands up quickly, grabbing the envelope and stuffing the cash back in. He closes the flap, holding the envelope tight as he stands on a small stepladder to check his shoe box safe at the top of the closet.\n\nHe shakes his head as he pulls down the box, seeing that there\u2019s already a stuffed envelope in there. Shoving the other one in as well, he closes the box and tosses it back into its place on the shelf.\n\nLooking around, he hunts for any clues as to where the money came from. Picking up his keyboard, he finds a single penny, but nothing else.\n\nIn the kitchen, he sees a figure, all white with the exception of the shoes, cutting something. David steps closer and closer, especially after seeing it has no reflection like Leah.\n\nTurning back toward David, the man grins wickedly. \u201cOh, I see you got my payment. I do enjoy a good show, and I\u2019m so pleased you chose to let me stay in here. I do believe we\u2019ll get to be good friends, don\u2019t you?\"\n\n-----\n\nThis is based off of the characters of my most popular prompt fill, if they sound familiar at all.\n\nCheck out my other writings on http://allharlowseve.wordpress.com/ to see what I've written lately, I'd appreciate it. xo",

I should have fleshed it out more but I thought about it as a polite, reserved, gay guy, working as a graphic designer who is a little beaten down by his disease juxtaposed against this obscene, womanising, arrogant, criminal who is in charge even though the first doesn\u2019t even know it. I don\u2019t mean to imply that homosexuals are weak, I was just trying to make them opposites in every way possible and a gay pimp with two dozen ish guys that can give him $500 a night each just didn\u2019t seem as plausible. I was going for the Jekyll-Hyde idea.  Then, building on that you would expect the more submissive personality to be completely owned and controlled by the dominant one. But twist, the law abiding character has realised that he has had this in his personality all along and becomes the super-dominant crime boss. If I were to flesh it out I would want the ending to imply further that he\u2019s mostly still the same person but he\u2019s traded in his recently sensible SUV for something ridiculous, left his job, several younger men and women living with him, and is expanding the crime network. So it\u2019s now the progression from the start where he\u2019s this mild mannered good guy evolving to this confident crime boss who uses people for his own pleasure. \n\nIf I new someone that made short films I\u2019d help them write it.

It\u2019s not like I\u2019m actively trying to bother you, it\u2019s just so unbearably boring up in here.\u201d\n\nFuck off, Larry! I didn\u2019t invite you into my brain; you came of your own accord and have annoyed me since.\n\n\u201c*I* don\u2019t know how I got here, all I know is that I appeared in the most boring mind possible.

You\u2019re the reason I can\u2019t go out to do anything. Your constant talking makes me act out and look insane.\n\n\u201cYou are kind of are insane.\u201d\n\nFuck you! It\u2019s your fault that I\u2019m like this, your fault that my medication doesn\u2019t work. You\u2019re the fucking worse, there\u2019s absolutely no benefit to having you here.

At least I got a bit of sleep.

HOW did you get it?\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s not important, though\u2026 I might have a bit more control over you than you think.\u201d\n\n*knock knock knock*\n\nShit, I\u2019ll get back to this later.

            "comment": "An envelope. A single envelope. That was the indicator that I knew I was crazy. Or was I? All I had done was simply ask my mind a question.\n\nI always knew there was some strange separate voice inside my head. One that would get riled up whenever something good happened. One that would fill my subconscious with self-doubt and self-deprecation. Why did he always have to ruin such a good moment with his opinion, or his desire, or his lethargy?\n\nI was still living at home in my parent\u2019s apartment with my two brothers. One older and one younger. It was one day that I decided to yell out loud to the darkness, in the cool still morning air of my bedroom.\n\n\u201cSTOP!!! I will not allow you to stay in my head anymore!! This is it! If you want to stay, you\u2019ll have to start paying rent if you want to live here. Otherwise you are no longer allowed in this house! This is a sanctuary and I\u2019m not allowing it to be defiled by the likes of you and your cruel silly jokes! You will pay for what you\u2019ve done to my life!\u201d\n\nAnd suddenly the voices in my head stopped. Silence. Such a beautiful gorgeous sound. The sound of nothingness. The tension in my body released. I was able to breath a full breath. The light started spilling in.\n\nI went about my day with a skip in my step and what\u2019s more, I even told my therapist about it and he gave me a high-five. I had only been diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 months ago and he said that I was making incredible progress ever since we started our sessions together.\n\nWeek by week, I was supposed to send him updates. So that was my update yesterday.\n\nBut today, an envelope appeared under my door. One single envelope with the word, \u201cRENT\u201d written in big bold sharpie on the front of it. That\u2019s when I started to freak out. The voices started coming back. It was a cacophony in my head again. Maybe I really was crazy. Maybe I would never be able to break free from this. I was doomed to be trapped in this prison from which I could never escape.\n\nI called my therapist to tell him what had happened and he said to just breath and calm down and to bring the envelope into the office. I picked up the envelope and opened the door. As I walked down the stairs, I noticed something funny about the envelope, it was my brother\u2019s signature handwriting. Then saw my older brother staring at me at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for all the things I\u2019ve done to you throughout your life, I hope this covers this month\u2019s rent.\u201d ",

            "comment": "I first saw Tony about a week after college.  It was at a party a coworker was throwing.  Tony was the other guy at the party who didn\u2019t seem to know anybody besides the host.  I\u2019d see him standing around small groups of people throughout the night, but never really saw him say anything.  He\u2019d laugh when someone would tell a joke, granted, but he never seemed to add to the conversation.  I assumed he was shy and didn\u2019t think much of it at the time, who was I to judge social skills?  I saw him around town a few times over the next few months, buying groceries, renting movies, or leaving a restaurant.  Still, I never actually saw him interact with anyone else.  \n\tIt started to bother me about a year later.  I\u2019d see Tony once or twice a month at this point, granted in a town this size, that\u2019s not a whole lot.  I realized I was going crazy when I thought about following him. I\u2019d seen him leaving restaurants after all, if I just followed him to one, I\u2019d get to see him order and be done with it.  Thankfully, I realized the rational thing to do would to be say, \u201cHi\u201d the next time I saw him. \n\tThe very next day he pulled up behind me to use the Redbox.  I had to laugh as I realized how paranoid I was being about the guy, one of us had to arrive somewhere before the other, it was just chance he was always going out as I was coming in.  So I scrolled to the next screen and casually asked him, like it wasn\u2019t a big deal I was finally going to get to hear the guy speak to someone after all this time.  \u201cYou just returning? If so you can go ahead, I may browse for a minute.\u201d  I awaited his reply with the same eagerness school children show towards the end of the day.  I was not disappointed, as I was able to have my first conversation with the totally normal, Tony.  \n\u201cNo, I\u2019m renting too, take your time man.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, any suggestions? Anything I shouldn\u2019t take because you have your eye on?\u201d I laughed, he laughed.  I clicked on the Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 and added it to my cart.\n\u201cI was going to rent the new Guardians movie.\u201d He said, as I froze before hitting checkout.  I turned to actually face the man I had obsessed about never having seen interact.  \u201cI hear it\u2019s a real trip.\u201d\nI laughed, \u201cGreat minds think alike. If you weren\u2019t just saying that because you saw me add it to my cart, what do you say you come over to my place, we can hang out and watch it?  I hear it\u2019s hard to make new friends after college, why not make the most of an opportunity?\u201d  \nHe accepted and that\u2019s when we became friends.  The weird thing was, I stopped seeing him around town so often after that. We started hanging out though, and I got to know the guy, he was nice, caring, but had a crazy since of humor, would just say some of the most bizarre things, \u201cWe should murder those children.\u201d \u201cJust slit that bitch\u2019s throat, then when you choke her, you can say you were trying to save her from bleeding out.\u201d  Weird things like that.  I never really got it the joke, and would usually just react with shock, but I think my shock is what he found funny.\nAbout a month ago, Tony was let go from his job.  The small company just had to cut back, and Tony had been there the shortest. He was living paycheck to paycheck, and couldn\u2019t afford rent, so I let him move in to the spare bedroom in my apartment.  Maybe it\u2019s just the extra exposure, but I do feel like the crazy things he says have been more frequent since he moved in.  I can\u2019t remember the last time I got a decent nights rest, and I can\u2019t figure out why.  He\u2019s not loud at night; he doesn\u2019t make any noise after he goes to bed at all in fact.  I don\u2019t see him again until the next evening usually, as I\u2019m getting home from work.  Usually, we chat, we eat, watch some TV or play some video games, and go to sleep.\nI didn\u2019t see Tony at all yesterday.  He\u2019s an adult, he can do his own thing without me worrying about him, but I did find it odd.  I went to bed and slept like a rock.  For the first time in a long time, I slept through the night.  However I woke up more tired than I\u2019ve been in years.  My whole body feels like I didn\u2019t sleep at all, and I was doing some strenuous activity all night. Granted my dreams were a little, vivid, and darker than normal, I\u2019m sure I tossed and turned all night.  Maybe a new mattress would help?  Anyways, I have a voicemail from Tony this morning, from my parent\u2019s number of all places. This is weird for two reasons; one, I don\u2019t remember ever actually introducing Tony to my parents, and two, my phone usually wakes me when it rings.  He says, \u201cHey man, my mother and father were killed last night, and I inherited a lot of money as a result. I\u2019ll make sure to get you covered for that month of rent.\u201d  I shook my head, people think about the craziest things when they are struck with bad news.  I wasn\u2019t worried about money for the favor I offered a friend, I never would have asked for it.  I just hope he\u2019s ok, losing one\u2019s parents, is just awful.  I deleted the message and listened to the second message, I also somehow slept through.  \u201cHi mister Cavanagh, This is Detective Thomas with the Boone County police department.  If you could just give us a call when you get this Sir, we don\u2019t seem to have an address on file with you and there is something that we would like to talk to you about in person.\u201d\nThe police? What on Earth do the police want?  I\u2019m too tired for this right now.  I\u2019m going to call into work and get some rest.  Maybe try to get ahold of Tony when I get up, make sure he\u2019s ok, the guy just lost his parents, the police and whatever they want can wait.\n\n--------\nGreat prompt, I hope this isn't awful.",

The voices were really active this morning.    He palmed his pills, painkillers and anti-psychotics from the small pillbox on his counter and downed them suppressing a laugh about the futility of taking the meds prescribed to suppress the voices. \"Schitzophrenic my ass\" he muttered under his breath \n\nHe sat down with the cold Pastramy and provalone sandwhich he tad taking from the fridge with his juice and started to eat while he waited for the carnival ride that was his daily life to start.\n\nBy the time he had finished his sandwhich an ethereal man in a Well tailored suit was sitting across the table behind the envelope.

Don't worry how it got there, I had a little helper aid me in that trivial affair.  Given the current monthly rate of your flat I feel the sum is rather appropriate, although might I suggest a lovely home further inland from the Bay Area?  It is so terribly expensive to live in San Francisco and it's such a shame to pay so much for such an itty bitty living space.  Although, all things considered, I suppose I should be the last one to speak of such matters, wouldn't you say?  Warmest regards, your friend, flatmate, well wisher and closest confidant...\"\n\nHe could barely stomach reading the next line-\n\n\"...Garfield\"\n\nGarfield crumpled the letter up. He stared at the cash sitting on the table, as his mind raced and his worst fears manifested themselves.  No, he could not assume the worst, he knew he was sick, surely this yet another manifestation of that same sickness?  Sleepwalking was possible.  Yes, that had to be it.  He must have written the letter in his sleep, or perhaps in a trance he didn't remember.  The money must also be his, withdrawn from the ATM at the grocery store down the street.  While concerning that so many events could transpire without his full consciousness, this was preferable to...the alternative hypothesis.  Yes, it had to be so, it MUST be so.  He'd just quickly verify the truth as he knew it, and then perhaps ask his doctor for a sleeping pill prescription...\n\nGarfield felt his heart climb into his throat.  During his mental processing of the transpired events, he'd begun the login process of is online banking profile, to confirm that he'd withdrawn 3,000 dollars via ATM as he'd hypothesized.\n\nBut the account was untouched.  The last activity was a frozen yogurt purchase he'd made 3 days earlier.  There was no 3,000 dollar withdrawal.  In fact, Garfield didn't even HAVE 3,000 dollars in his checking account to withdraw from (a fact that he'd tried to suppress as it gnawed on him), and there'd been no transfer from his savings into checking either.  There was no way to account for the mystery 3,000.  \n\nWorse, the letter had been written in a neat cursive.  Garfield's cursive was illegible even to himself, and he'd been out of practice for many years now beyond the occasional signature.\n\nWhere did this money come from?  And who had written that letter?  And why did they sign the letter with Garfield's own name?\n\nGarfield refused to accept the supernatural.  There had to be a rational explanation.  There was no such thing as a voice inside your head that could write you a letter and pay a renter's fee.  This was a joke.  A cruel, and elaborate joke.  He was the victim of some sick reality tv show.  Or it was the government, the government was *spying* on him.  This must have been some idea of an \"office prank\" over at the FBI.  No, the CIA.  Or maybe the NSA?  It had to have been all three, and the Coast Guard too.  He'd always mad fun of the Coast Guard, and now they wanted revenge.  Yes, they were all in on it, it was a secret plot to destroy him.  Damn the Coast Guard!\n\nBut why him?  What had poor Garfield ever done to anybody?  Why should he deserve such torture?  For the letter and the bills had truly unnerved him.  For it to be possible, someone must have access to Garfield's flat.  They had been able to break and enter into his very home, his refuge, his sanctuary from the outside world.  He felt violated, he felt sick.  How could they have got in?  He frantically checked the windows.  No broken panes or locks.  He checked the doors.  Same story.  They must have a key, that was the only explanation.  He'd been betrayed, double crossed, sold out by the landlord.  Wasn't the landlord's brother in the Coast Guard?  That must have been it.  He'd identified the motive, there could be no other logical explanation.  Oh how he hated the Coast Guard!\n\nWell, no more would he be victim to this Orwellian government scrutiny.  He would protect himself and his home.  I \"they\" had a key, well, fine then.  Garfield would play one step ahead.  Never again would they confuse and humiliate him like this.  Garfield set to work with wooden 2x4's and hammer.  All he needed to do was board up the door, then nobody could get in while Garfield was asleep, and leave mysterious letters that filled him with fear.  Best board up the windows too, in case they get crafty and decide to enter in that way.  ",

            "comment": "My room smells of weed, old pizza, and a general body odor that could be my own. The bed I sit on is half covered in books, half covered in blankets. The ground space is limited to pathways.\n\nI have never met my roommate. I always wait till he goes to bed before I come out of my room at night, and in the morning he leaves for work before I get up.\n\nJohn Rollingstonstein. That's what he said his name was. He had... brown hair. I think he works for the government, in that brick building by the old state hospital. Sometimes I park my car at the park nearby, watching the entryways. I don't know why. Maybe I want to see him in his more natural environment before I see him at home.\n\nHe leaves his rent in an envelope. Sets it on the kitchen counter, next to the bananas. He never leaves a check, always cash. \n\nOverall, he's been a good roommate. \n\nBut I can't remember what he looks like. Well, not exactly, it's more like he looks slightly different everytime I remember him. His hair shifts from brown to blonde. His height varies by several inches as if he chooses to slouch in my memory. I just can't pin him down.\n\nWhen did I see him last?\n\nI hear him close the apartment door. Off to work.\n\nI get out of bed, still naked, and smoke a bowl. I slip on my grimy sweatpants and the same hoodie as yesterday, and slowly open the door of my bedroom. Quiet.\n\nI walk through the door and directly into the bathroom to take a nice shit. With me, is Slow Boat by Hideo Furukawa. I sit on the toilet and read. Taking in the Japanese dropouts girlfriend troubles, and his inability to escape the sprawling confines of Tokyo, as I feel last nights McDonalds flushing out of me. The book is propulsive so far, and with a length of only 120 pages or so, it will be finished when I am standing up next.\n\nFor food today I think ill have nothing. I can't think of anything to eat besides fast food, and fast food always gives me diarrhea. I'll just drink Coca-cola, smoke weed, and read, not wasting my calories. \n\nMaybe I'll go look at Rollinstonsteins brick workplace, listen to music and get high in the world at large.Avoiding the eyes of all those people.\n\nBut... maybe I should just stay home today. There's no real need to leave the house. My sanity can wait another day.\n \nI wait in my room. In the dark, reading by the bleak light of the overcast winter sky. With me, on the bed, is a history book about Northern Michigan native Americans. Detailing the shift in perspective on French colonialism, by focusing instead on the dominance of the native Americans in the Straits region. An interesting book, but filled with repetition. I skim it. It is better read that way. \n\nI hear the door close. He never makes any other sound until he turns on the TV. He watches Law and Order, Big Brother, Survivor, the Office. He laughs at the fraternity antics. He makes me sick. When I hear his voice I want to clog up his throat with detritus. With all the trash that's been piling up in my room. His voice fills me with rage. \n\nBut he pays the rent. And he believes that the rent is twice what it really is. ",

I\u2019m always sick of it, it bothers the hell out of me. \n\n\nWell, a few days ago I had an idea. What if I asked the voice to pay rent, because I mean it is my brain.\n\n\nSo I asked something like this, \u201cHey! Time to pay rent, your 27 years late!\u201d. \u201cUgh, we have names and feelings too, you know!\u201d, they had exclaimed simultaneously. \u201cI\u2019m Schiz\u201d, said one voice. \u201cI\u2019m O.\u201d said another, \u201cAnd i\u2019m ophrenia.\u201d said the last voice. \u201cWell, pay up!\u201d, I thought. They went silent afterwards. \n\n\nI woke up this morning, to find an envelope on my table. I looked inside and it had $15,000.

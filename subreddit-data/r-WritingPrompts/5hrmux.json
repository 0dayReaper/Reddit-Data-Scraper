            "comment": "\"Hey kids, you got fifty bucks?\" Dennis asked the three teenagers giggling softly on the street corner. \n\nHe saw them hanging around often enough, always tripping out of their minds. Perhaps they were high enough to give him more than usual, tonight.\n\n\"Fifty points to Gryffindor! You hear that?\" the boy with the unkempt black hair yelled. \"We won the House Cup, Ron! Dumbledore said so!\" \n\n\"Yes, yes, well done. And it's Dennis, remember?\" he said, but the kids didn't listen. The girl with the bushy hair just shoved a bill in his hand, weeping with joy as she did so. \n\nDennis grinned to himself - he'd long since learned that playing along with whatever they were babbling about paid off handsomely. \n\nSuddenly, the girl rose unsteadily to her feet and pointed down the street.\n\n\"Look at that, Harry! What are those dementors doing?\"\n\nA couple of policemen were crowded around a man waving a knife, in the midst of what looked like a robbery gone wrong. One of them suddenly tackled the man to the ground. Dennis shook his head to himself: the Hogwarn neighbourhood really was such a dodgy area. He often wondered how these kids had wound up here in the first place.\n\n\"Right, I'm going over there,\" Harry said, getting to his feet and promptly falling over on top of the red-headed boy, who yelped with pain. \n\n\"You stay in the hospital wing, Ron, you're not well,\" the girl said, tugging Harry's hand and helping him up. They stumbled along down the street as the red-headed boy passed out. \n\nDennis followed quietly: they were really far gone tonight. Part of him was concerned - he'd grown fond of the delinquent little assholes, despite them never remembering his name. Another part knew there was probably more money in it for him, tonight, if he followed them.\n\nThe cops looked agitated - the man with the knife was now slumped on the ground.\n\n\"He's passed out. Is he faking? What the hell's going on?\" one demanded.\n\n\"I don't know, maybe something happened when he hit the ground. I'm performing CPR to be safe, but the bastard might be faking it,\" another grunted, and crouched down, looping his hand around the back of the man's head and leaning down.\n\n\"Noooo, stoppit, don't take his soul. Espeto Patroni...no, that's not right...expect a patronising...what is it again, Hermione?\" Harry moaned, stumbling forward and tripping over his feet.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" a detective snapped, trying to push the boy away. \"Get lost, kid. This is serious!\"\n\n\"Sirius!\" Harry wept, as the girl gave a soft scream and clapped her hands to her mouth.\n\nDennis grabbed hold of them both and led them away, muttering a half-hearted excuse to the red-faced detective. \n\nThey both looked so miserable he felt a little sorry for them. He sighed at his own generosity but dug in his coat pocket and produced the grimy fifty-dollar bill he'd taken off them earlier.\n\n\"Here. Take this for uhm...bravery. Fifty points, right?\" he said, shoving it at the boy. \"Go buy a bus ticket home, kids. Your parents must be worried.\"\n\n\"Merlin's beard, Dumbledore, his parents are *dead*, you should know that,\" Hermione whispered, rubbing at her bloodshot eyes and looking deeply disappointed in him as the boy wept harder.\n\nFor some reason, he felt guilty at that. Perhaps he should make an effort to understand better. Besides, they looked like they were having fun, waving those little sticks in their hands like they were powerful weapons. It must be pretty good weed. \n\n\"What are you kids taking, anyway?\" he asked.\n\nThe girl looked surprised and turned out her pockets. Out fell many little sacks of pale-brown powder.\n\n\"*Chocolate,*\" she winked at him, trying to tap her nose and failing. \"For the dementors, you know..\"\n\nDennis felt his mouth go dry. Holy hell. He'd assumed weed: just think of the money he could score from all that. His earlier good intentions to befriend the kids evaporated.\n\nHe grabbed the product from the girl's hands. \"Great. Great, I'll go uhm...use it against them, shall I?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Hermione nodded affably. \"That's a good idea. You're a great wizard, Dumbledore.\"\n\nHe sprinted away, leaving the two teenagers swaying in the road. He seemed to be running in the opposite direction as the dementors, but that was alright. Dumbledore would never fail them.\n\n\"Great man, Dumbledore,\" Harry muttered, drooping against Hermione. \"Let's go...wake Ron. Where's Ron?\"\n\nThey turned to see a single dementor closing in on Ron, who was gesturing wildly in the night. He seemed to be clutching a rat he'd caught to his chest. They could faintly hear him yelling 'Scabbers! You're alive!'. \n\n\"We should...hurry...\" Harry muttered, feeling incredibly tired suddenly. \"That thing could suck out his soul.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, Harry, Ron is perfectly safe,\" Hermione said, leaning forward to whisper in his ear. \"He's a ginger, you know.\"\n\nThey blinked at one another and then burst into peals of laughter, drawing the astonished gazes of the people hurrying by. You rarely heard laughter in Hogwarn, or saw kids roaming around after daylight, for that matter. It was a pretty crazy place.\n\n---------\nHope you enjoyed my story! You can find more of my work on /r/Inkfinger/.\n\n**edit**: Oh, you guys, you gave me gold! That's awesome, thanks :D ",

Like whoa that night is indeed magic eyes rainbows circles grids and feeling connected to a psychedelic heaven the whole time. That was quite a magical show.",

            "comment": "**The Nurse.**  \nYou know what\u2019s crazy? Unicorns. Woodland creatures that have magical horns capable of remedying any ailment, so long as they were first tamed by virgins.  \n\nYou know what\u2019s straight up *unbelievable*? The fact that these kids are somehow scoring smack in here. \n\nFor the life of me I can\u2019t figure out how they\u2019re doing it, and doing it daily. I can\u2019t recall a single day, *not one day*, since they were admitted that I did not find them floating around the stratosphere at least once. All three of them. Some days they are high before I even get to work, and by the time I knock off nothing\u2019s changed. And when they're high, there's bound to be trouble. \n\nLike just last week, the little one, Harris, had stood in the rec room, naked as a jaybird, screaming \u201cExpelliarmus\u201d while masturbating furiously. He called his penis his \u201cwand\u201d, and I\u2019m guessing you can figure out what it was he was expelling. Even in a psychiatric ward, that\u2019s weird. But not as weird as when the girl, Heloise, joined him there. She had somehow found a dildo, god knows where from, and had followed Harris' lead. \u201cEngorio\u201d she\u2019d muttered as she twirled it around and, yes, I do believe she was trying to make it bigger. Luckily Roland was passed out on the couch at the time so there were no shenanigans from him. Not then.  \n\nThank all that is holy for security. If they weren\u2019t around I don\u2019t know how I would have dealt with it. Hell, I was ready to pack it in and quit right then and there. I was just starting to get Harris to calm down, agreeing with him that I was professor McGonagall and the Gryffindor was, in fact, the best when the state ward, old Mr. Dimple, had stood up. As I struggled with the boy, the old bum walked over to the basin in the corner of the room, and unceremoniously dunked his head face first into the water that someone - not me \u2013 had failed to drain from it. I swear I will hear the sound his head made as it smacked into the porcelain in my nightmares for the rest of my life.  When Harris saw him doing this, he\u2019d stopped struggling, shushed the girl and disengaged himself from me. Together, they headed over with me trailing behind. I was scared, I admit it. I felt sure that sure Dimple was dead. \n\nI thought at first that they would try to help the old man, but instead the boy had looked at his companion, wide eyed, and intoned in a solemn voice that \u201cDumbledore is using the pensieve to see my memories\u201d. That was when the security guard had poked his head into the rec area, saw what was going on and he, together with two or three orderlies had pulled them away from the old man. The commotion had woken Roland, and he\u2019d joined the fray screaming something about \u201cwizard\u2019s chess\u201d and \u201cprotect the queen!\u201d It took another three guards to wrestle the patients back to the secure wing. \n\nDimple is in the infirmary with fluid in his lungs. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to make it.  \n\nYou know what's really bizarre? I couldn\u2019t find the dildo afterwards.  \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this.\n\n**The Gang.**  \nEarly morning sunlight filtered through the louvered window set in the ceiling of the padded cell. It played across Harry\u2019s closed eyelids, and he stirred, woke. \nHis limbs felt rigged, constrained, and when looked down at himself he was horrified to discover that the top half of his boy was entirely ensconced in what seemed to be a cocoon of silk. He turned his head and saw Ron lying to his left, similarly secured, and below his feet, lying on her side, Hermione. \n\nHe tested his bonds. His legs were free, just asleep, but he found that he could move them easily one the prickle-pain of returning circulation had passed. His arms, however-  \n\nTight, like a steel wire wound securely around a drum and he knew right away that there was no escaping from it using conventional means. No, this called for magic, but the way in which his arms were folded across his midriff made reaching for his wand an impossibility. Panic rose in his throat but he pushed it down. That was what Voldemort wanted, to make them scared, because a scared wizard was one who made mistakes. Harry closed his eyes, concentrated on his breathing and counted backwards from ten, forcing his fevered mind back into a state of calm. When he was able to focus, he looked around again. Ron would be no help, Harry could see that his friend was as immobile as he was, if not more so. But Hermione\u2026  It looked as if one of the strands of silk that surrounded her had come unstuck from the rest, and it was possible, maybe just possible, that she would be able to free an arm.\n\nHe looked around the room again. It was not one he recognized, but somehow he felt that they were still in Hogwarts. There was a certain familiarity about it, and he thought that it might have been the Room of Requirement. Someone else\u2019s requirement, obviously, since the last thing any of them required was to be bound and held against their will. It was not very large, circular, completely white from floor to celling and empty, except for the mirror of Erised which was shoved against the far wall. There was no one else in the room and Harry felt confident that they weren\u2019t being watched. It felt safe to call out, so he did.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d\n\nAt first there was no response, but then she stirred, and a moan escaped her lips. He called again and this time her eyes fluttered open, and he watched as she looked around, straining against the bonds. \n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d  \n\nShe looked at him, confused.\n\n\u201cHarry, what is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just woke up myself, but look, it\u2019s going to be all right. We\u2019re getting out of this. It looks as if you\u2019ll be able to get your hand out.\u201d\n\nThe girl wriggled in her cocoon. \n\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d Relief lightened her features. \u201cI think I will.\u201d\n\nRon woke then, and after a few moments of alarmed yelling, Harry and Hermione was able to calm him down and explain the situation. \n\n\u201cBlood hell,\u201d he muttered, \u201cthis stuff looks like Aragog\u2019s web. Remember Harry, when we went into Forbidden Forrest that time?  The spiders kept their food wrapped up like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Ron,\u201d Hermione spat. \u201cAragog is Harry\u2019s friend, why would he bind us up like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Ron muttered again, but said no more.\n\nIt took a long time, but with a great amount of wriggling and contorting Hermione was able to free her arm, and after that it was short work to free herself and then the other two. All three of them retrieved their wands from beneath their robes, Hermione struggling  bit to dislodge hers from where she had hidden it, and then they walked around the room, wands at the ready. They tried to find a breach in the walls, some way to escape, but found nothing. Finally, they lined up, shoulder to shoulder in front of the mirror.\n\n\u201cThis is Voldemort\u2019s doing,\u201d Harry said, \u201cit\u2019s got dark magic written all over it. What I can\u2019t figure out is how he got into Hogwarts. Dumbledore\u2019s spells prevents it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry\u2026\u201d Hermione began and then paused, uncertain. Both Harry and Ron looked at her, surprised. It was unlike her to be at a loss for words. The girl saw them looking, bit her lip, looked down at the floor. When she continued, her voice was scarcely above a whisper. \n\n\u201cDumbledore is captured, Harry. I saw some Dementors making off with him after the battle. Before they brought us here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t help us now.\u201d  \n\n**The Doctor.**  \nIt was fascinating to watch them.  \n\nNot in all his years in psychiatry had he seen such a perfectly shared hallucination. All three of them, in synch, seeing the same fantasy, immersed in it. Sure, the heroin he administered on a daily basis probably had some role to play, but he doubted that it did much more than assist them in conjuring up new adventures to complete their reality. The real science here was studying the phenomenon of three such disparate subjects seizing on the same narrative and living it out. It was the minutiae of their actions that made it so interesting, the way in which they tackled real-world problems as if it were a part of the fantasy. Like the thing with the straight-jackets. These now lay discarded in a heap in the middle of the room as the trio discussed this 'Voldemort'. It had been the doctor who had slipped one of the straps loose from the girls jacket when they had been brought it, just to see how they would incorporate this opportunity into their world. And they'd done it, seizing upon something called Aragog without hesitation as soon as the red-haired boy had mentioned it. All of them, their minds immediately in perfect agreement about what Aragog was and that he was real, even though the word had never been spoken between them before.\n\nIt was, in his opinion, not far-fetched to consider the possibility of actual, real world telepathy taking place here, and if he could somehow prove it\u2026Hello Nobel prize.\n\nHe glanced at his watch.\n\n\u201cHagrid.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Dr. Riddle?\u201d The bearded intern looked up from his clipboard and waited.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get them ready for bed.\u201d \n",

            "comment": "\"Johnson, we got another code five oh seven.\"\n\nIt was all I could do to not bang my head against my desk. Repeatedly. \"Rick, does it have to be me?\" \n\nThe portly man turned to me and said sympathetically. \"Sorry Matt, but it does. After your little 'drug bust' turned out to be glitter for a first-grader, chief has made it clear you get every job on the shit-list.\" \n\nI was still convinced we had been duped on that job, but I kept my mouth shut. Last time I brought it up chief Vick had almost fired me. I sighed deeply and got up. Code 507 meant that the trio had been sighted again. It happened so often that we had separate code *just* for them. \n\nGrumbling, I left the police station and went to my cruiser. I spoke into the radio, \"where was the last sighting, Rick?\" \n\n\"Near the Goldman Sachs international building, near...\" he paused, probably pulling up a map, \"Ah...near the intersection of fleet street and Fetter lane. Good luck, man,\" he finished, completely insincerely. \n\nI could just see him wearing that smug little smile on his face in my head. I said something impolite and turned off the radio. \n\nI drove through the crowded street of London. These assholes couldn't have picked any other time than 4 pm? Traffic was moving at crawl. \n\nThis was the fifth call this month. They were always causing some public disruption or other, thinking they were \"wizards.\" They actually had wooden sticks that they claimed vigorously were their wands. They weren't insane I was pretty sure. They were just high. Constantly. I was pretty sure they were high 90 percent of he time. The times we were called in was just when they were bad enough that people bothered to call the police. \n\nI finally arrived at the building, and sure enough, the three were standing there...under a bed sheet.\n\nWhy me?\n\nI parked my cruiser by the curb and started moving towards them. They whispered among themselves excitedly, as if trying to keep their voices low. I finally walked up to them. \"Erm...what the hell are you doing?\"\n\nThe short one, made *shhh* noise to the rest, still not coming out of the sheet. My freaking life. \"I can see you, you know. And hear you.\"\n\nA series of gasps went up from them, and I pulled the sheet from them.\n\n\"You can see past the invisibility cloak?!\" The short one seemed genuinely shocked. \n\n\"No,\" I explained gently, \"this is just a normal sheet.\" *With some suspicious looking stains on it.* \n\n\"Ha!\" Now the girl was talking. \"You probably have some sort of counter-spell, this cloak was given to Harry by Dumbledore himself, and he would never lie.\"\n\nOh right, the ever present Dumbledore. He was an insane guy. But also insanely rich. I'm pretty sure he was the one who provided them with drugs for his own sick amusement. Of course they trusted him completely.\n\n\"No, I've told you,\" fighting to keep myself calm, \"Dumbledore is either insane, or a liar. Probably both.\"\n\n\"Whatever, I'll let you guys off this time, standing under a sheet his hardly worth arresting you guys for.\" *Plus the paperwork would be hell.*  \n\nBefore I could say anything else the short one said screamed, \"*Stupefy!*\" and *threw a rock at me.*\n\nI cursed as the rock struck me in the nose. Hard. I blinked tears out of my eyes and the girl yelled, \"RUN!\" \n\nIt could never be easy.\n\nI took after them as they sprinted away. I was catching up to them when they got on some metal scooters, they called them \"broomsticks\" and sped away. \n\nI stopped running, I would never catch them now, they would disappear into the side streets. \n\nWhatever. It really wasn't worth it. I went back to the station, reporting I had never found them. Rick saw me when I came back in.\n\n\"I thought you were catching junkies, not getting plastic surgery, Matt.\"\n\n\"Shut up, Rick,\" I said irritably and went to get an ice pack. \n\n***\nIf you enjoyed, check out my new subreddit [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/)",

            "comment": "And the light of the morning streamed in, illuminating Harry's track-mark scabbed arms, as he lay outstretched in the vomit-stained mattress where he found his only peace, in the corner of an empty room in a long abandoned warehouse in Hackney.\n\nHarry woke up, coughing, as the sunlight reached his eyelids. He wiped the sweat from his face with his blanket and sat, holding his head in his hands.\n\nHe was desperately trying to cling onto his dream. It was about something really important. But his old Nokia made a sound, interrupting him, and he tilted his head to read the screen - \"17 unread messages from: Hans van Voldemort\". His stomach twisted as reality came back to him. If he didn't get Voldemort's money by the end of the day, he was fucked. \n\nHe staggered to his feet and into the next room where Dumbledore was asleep wrapped in three coats. He shook him - 'Dumbledore wake up. What the fuck am I going to do. Voldemort's going to -'\n'Fucks sake Harry. Don't wake me up like that.' Dumbledore rocked himself upright and shook himself awake, before brushing a greasy curl of hair out of his eyes and lighting the butt of a roll-up from the floor. 'Harry I didn't tell you before but I've found something a bit special. It'll take your mind right off Voldemort. Cook this up for us will you.'\n\nHarry went about preparing the syringe, wiping last night's blood away. Dumbledoor sat and alternated between smoking and coughing until everything was ready. 'You go first', said Dumbledore, 'you look like you need to forget your problems.'\n\n'Yeah, I just need a little pick me up so I can think straight, and work out what to do', slurred Harry. As his eyes rolled back into his skull, the last thing he saw was the syringe in his twitching hand.\n\nHe sank back into his dream. It all came back to him. He was young again. The warehouse turned into his old school. Everything was magical, everyone loved him, and he had incredible powers. But he couldn't forget his problems. His memories of Voldemort, the police, his old boss, the school bully, all twisted into terrible nightmares and chased him deep into his mind, stalking him, lurking behind every corner.\n\nDumbledore gathered up his stuff and left after he couldn't wake Harry up a day later. He didn't know what Voldemort was after Harry for, but he didn't want to be there to find out. Harry was still lying in a pool of sweat and urine, gibbering gently into his pillow. Dumbledore looked back over his shoulder with a twinge of remorse, necked the dregs of his warm beer, and closed the door of the warehouse behind him.",

He lay clutching his dirty syringe, sweating profusely, mumbling in his sleep about wands and wizards, occasionally moaning out confused fragments from his long forgotten Latin GCSE exam.\n\nHe was eventually jarred awake by a rapid crashing sound which he gradually identified as someone at the warehouse door. \n\nHarry heard a voice outside, \"Open up Harry. I just want to have a word. It's all cool, mate.\" which was followed by a barely whispered, \"Get your knife ready, Barty\".\n\nHarry's bloodshot eyes snapped open.\n\nHe heard several loud noises, followed by swearing. The voices became clearer. Closer.\n\n\"Hope you don't mind us letting ourselves in. Where are you Harry? You gouching out upstairs are you, you useless junkie fuck?\"\n\nThe sound of footsteps ascending the staircase.\n\nHarry panicked. He tried to tiptoe out of bed and tripped over a beer can. It clattered across the room.\n\n\"What was that?!\" the footsteps quickened. \"I think it came from in there\", a second voice this time.\n\nThe door was just within his reach. He managed to lock it a moment before the handle started to be turned, from the outside.\n\n\"Now now Harry, don't play games.\" \n\nThey were arguing, in slightly muffled tones. Finally, one of them grunted \"Alright fine I'll do it myself then if it will shut you up about that fucking shoulder of yours!\", and there was a cacophany of wood and splinters. \n\nThey entered the room, but Harry was nowhere to be seen. \n",

For Christ's sake.\"\n\nHarry tried to collect his thoughts, but all of them were \"Oh, God\". He needed to breathe. To calm down. To think. He had managed to scramble behind a loosely boarded-up fireplace, and pull the cover back in place behind himself, just in time. The air was thick with soot. He stifled a cough. Could he breathe in here? For how long?\n\nFootsteps. Muffled conversation. Swearing.\n\nOh, God. Would he die in here? Would they just burn the whole place down? Was a fireplace a safe place to be in a fire? Was it the worst place? Oh, God. Even in the darkness, he could feel the room spinning. Half formed, terrifying images threatened to devour him in the shadows. Everything was a blur. He couldn't see straight. But he needed to think straight. As his eyes got used to the lack of light, he made out a glimmer which caught his attention. He reached into the blackness and picked up a small glass smoking pipe. He held it up to the crack in the boarding which was letting a sliver of light through. It had something in it! What the hell it was he had no idea. He put it back down. Never mind that, he thought, there are more important things to deal with. What was it? Is a fire place a place that stops fires? What had woken him up again? His eyes fell on the pipe again. A terrifying, pale faced demon lurched at him out of the darkness, but he ignored it with little more than a twitch. What was he even doing in here in the dark? He felt like there was a very important reason he was in here, but his brain was too foggy right now. Why was he in here with that pipe? It seemed logical that he had brought it in to smoke it, but he felt that there were pressing matters to deal with, whatever they were. He realised he'd better hurry up and smoke it and then think about whatever he needed to think about, fast. He pulled a lighter out of his pocket and lit the mysterious pipe, inhaling deeply.\n\nThe flames burned an eery green, wrapping him in an emerald, glowing haze. He slumped, unconscious.\n\nEDIT: Moved this here since the threading seems to work better this way? New to Reddit, apologies :)",

            "comment": "\u201cExpeliarmus, Expeliarmus Harry.\u201d Hermione whispered to herself as she warmed her glass pipe filled with crack-cocaine.\n\nRon sat next to Hermione on Harry\u2019s torn, raggedy couch. His eyes were grey and lifeless. Every once in a while he could be heard muttering to himself. It seemed that his magic wand wasn\u2019t working quite right for him. It kept on backfiring spells.\n\nHarry paced the dirty room in front of him. His eyes were wild, and there were rough, purple bruises on his right forearm. The room was cluttered, and filled with trash and old takeaway food. Bottles of brown liquor and cigarette butts littered the coffee table in front of Hermione and Ron.\n\n\u201cWe gotta go get Dumbledore!\u201d Harry yelled, suddenly turning towards his two friends.\n\nRon jumped up off of the couch. His eyes unfocused. \u201cOnly Dumbledore will know how to get rid of Dementors.\u201d He said.\n\nThe two burst out of Harry\u2019s apartment, leaving Hermione behind on the couch. She told them to go ahead, she needed to spend time in the library to study for their next exams. She took a long drag of her pipe.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always busy studying.\u201d Harry said as Ron and him left the apartment building and found themselves on the street.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it. I could study just as hard as her, and never be good at magic at all.\u201d Ron complained.\n\nThe two shambled down the street. They were dressed in rags, and their shoes were worn thin.\n\n\u201cNo Ron, you\u2019re great at magic. Just so great at magic.\u201d Harry replied absentmindedly. It was hard for him to focus on Ron. A thousand different ideas were rushing through his mind.\n\nThe two stumbled into a nearby alleyway. They followed the smell of piss and alcohol until they found Dumbledore sleeping in a pile of rubbish. The homeless man was a booze fiend, and had taught Ron, Hermione, and Harry everything they knew about magic.\n\n\u201cDumbledore. Dumbledore!\u201d Harry yelled, kicking the filthy homeless man.\n\nDumbledore stuttered, and looked up at the two boys with bloodshot eyes. It took him a couple of moments to regain his grasp on reality.\n\n\u201cOh, boys, boys. It\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d Dumbledore said, slowly sitting up. His hands absentmindedly rummaged through the trash surrounding him, looking for a drop of liquor hidden away somewhere in the rubbish.\n\n\u201cDumbledore. We need a new spell! We\u2019ve gotten tired of our old one.\u201d Ron whined.\n\n\u201cOh boys, boys, I\u2019ve got just the thing.\u201d Dumbledore replied, reaching a shaking hand into his coat pocket. He produced a small, dirty plastic bag, wrapped in saran wrap. A brown powder could be seen through the layers of plastic.\n\n\u201cBut first.\u201d Dumbledore replied, batting away Ron and Harry\u2019s greedy hands. \u201cYou must understand the responsibility of magic. It is not some plaything to be used willy nilly. It must be treated with respect, and only used in your greatest time of need.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, of course.\u201d Harry replied, rushed. He threw forty quid at Dumbledore\u2019s feet, and snatched the baggie of heroin from Dumbledore\u2019s hands.\n\nRon and Harry left Dumbledore in the alleyway, and rushed back to Harry\u2019s apartment. Hermione was passed out on the couch, busy with her studies. Harry and Ron snuck off to Harry\u2019s bedroom, and were soon trying out their newest spell, Drugseptiem Overdosis.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, they were transported to the grand halls of Hogwarts, and were in a fever pitch battle with their greatest nemesis, Lord Voldemort.\n\nHarry\u2019s phone buzzed as the two were passed out. His mother, J.K. Rowling, was calling. She was writing a new book that was going to make her filthy rich, and she liked to call her son and use some of his crazy stories as inspiration for her writing.\n\n-------------------------\n\nHope you liked it.

            "comment": "Hermione's hair was bushy and tangled as always as she lay sprawled in the soft grass of the hillside beside their school, where she always hung out with her two best friends during breaks or after school; usually, they would get high and talk about philosophy. \n\nHermione usually got \"heady highs\" and would want to talk about books or societal constructs, Black Lives Matter or the necessity for political activism in general. \n\nRon was an all out foodie, and didn't really contribute much intellectually as much as he was a comforting and mellow presence--which Hermione had to admit definitely helped balance out Harry's high manner. \n\nHarry, she was sorry to acknowledge was super paranoid and oftentimes a buzzkill. She vaguely understood that he had a sort of narcissism complex brought on by insecurity and feelings of inadequacy, but he was always second guessing everyone and, more often than not, only saw the worst in people. \n\nTake Damon Mallory for instance--the kid was annoying, there was no denying that. A very rich (and very handsome boy) with a real superiority issue. He always wore emerald green Ralph Lauren jumpers and his teeth were unnaturally white. Hermione thought his hair was a bit too slicked back, he had an unmistakable \"oily-ness\" to him. That being said....he was not the villain that high Harry always imagined him to be. And Harry was convinced that Damon was plotting to kill the old homeless man they called Dumbledoore. But Hermione knew it was only the metaphor of Damon's capitalistic ambitions that was killing Dumbledoore. Although, when Damon had called Hermione a slut three years ago--she had to admit she had really enjoyed punching him in the face. \n\nThen there was the creepy, albeit harmless, teacher Mr. Snape. Snape was strange. He taught Advanced Maths and Chemistry--it was clear that he held a grudge for not being at a more prestigious school or for not being taken more seriously by his slacker and stoner students but, Harry was convinced that Snape was part of a small mafioso or Neo-Nazi member. It was a bit ridiculous and Hermione knew that Harry took it too far and occasionally made Snape get into serious trouble...but she couldn't deny it was fun to look for evidence. \n\nAs Hermione lay immersed in these reflections suddenly Ron's booming voice snapped her back to the present moment. \n\n\"Hey, do you think if Mermaids were real they would lay eggs? And would their eggs only hatch if they were underwater? Do chicken eggs only hatch above water?\" Ron's eyes were bloodshot and his red hair was long and stringy over his tattered plaid shirt. \n\nHermione hated these sorts of ponderings because they were so hypothetical that there was no logical answer she could provide. She felt exasperated for being interrupted from her pseudo-psychological musings. \n\n\"I don't know Ronald\" she replied cattily\n\n\"Oh, but you know I think if Mermaids could speak or if they cried when they hatched they would have the worst, gnarly-like voices. It would probably be screeches and we couldn't take the sound with our human ears\" Ron continued, unphased. \n\nHarry sat up too and smiled. \n\n\"I feel like I've heard those kind of voices before,\" Harry chimed in excitedly. Hermione mustered the effort it took her to roll her eyes. \n\n\"Really, dude?\" Ron asked. \n\n\"Yeah, remember when a couple years ago those exchange students from Russia came to our school? I went swimming with one of them in the lake, over there and I swear they brought some dank stuff with them because I heard voices---almost sounded like snake voices...\" Harry trailed off, lost in his own reflections. A worried look settling on his brow now. \n\nHermione sighed, \"And what do snake voices sound like Harry? Pray tell?\" \n\nBut Harry didn't answer he was full-stage paranoid now. His whole body was tense. Hermione felt the urge to get up and go comfort him. \n\nRon turned back to Hermione. \n\n\"Do you think if we could hear snake voices it would mean we were evil?\" \n\n\"I've always been afraid something in me was evil,\" Harry said quietly, with resolution. \"Now I know there is.\" \n\n\"Harry, you're not evil. For fuck's sake, you're on the hockey team. You're the best player. You eat chocolate nuts every day. You're a normal teenage boy who does too many drugs\" Hermione rationalised. \n\n\"It's okay Hermione, I know I can fight it. There is more good in us all--from our understanding of love. Our first memories of love make us overpower the evil.\" \n\n\"Dude, you're my best friend!\" Ron exclaimed and Ron and Harry highfived. They both laid back down in the grass. \n\nThe sun shown out in the warmish October afternoon. And Hermione thought she had the best, if not the stupidest and mushiest friends in the world. \n",

            "comment": "Officer Jones and Officer Smith were normal policemen. They were fine with pulling over people and dealing with the occasional hold up at a convenience store but they had never dealt with something like this. Jones didn't think they ever would again. It all started when they were sitting in their car, watching for speeders on a long straight road that the county still hadn't managed to start building speed bumps for. Across the road from them three kids came out of the woods. They looked disheveled and all had a crazy glint in their eyes. And, Smith noted with some curiosity, they were all tightly gripping sticks. Smith and Jones looked at each other, discussed it for a couple seconds, and then decided that Smith would go talk to them while Jones stayed in the car. Smith reluctantly began crossed the street to the kids, but midway one of them raised his stick. The girl screamed \"You can do it Harry, come on!\" Smith called out \"Look Harry, I'm not sure what you're trying to do but it won't work with that stick of yours.\" Suddenly the boy with the raised stick screamed \"Expecto Patronum!\" Nothing happened. They all paused. Smith sighed. And then suddenly a stag came tearing out of the woods. It sprinted across the street and slammed into Jones using its antlers. It caught him on them and twisted its head, throwing him onto the hood of the police car, where Jones was freaking out. He kicked open the door and shot the stag repeatedly before turning towards the kids. They were sprinting back into the woods, but one paused and turned around. He screamed \"Sectum Semperum\" and threw his stick. It flew through the air and stuck in Jones eye. He fell to the ground screaming. Two more victims of the magic kids.",

When these kids were sent to work sorting bags by their parents who owed debts, Prof. D thought it would be easy, but no.

            "comment": "\"And now we go live to a scene of absolute ruckus in Edinburgh, Scotland, where hordes of angry Harry Potter fans are gathered outside the house of J. K. Rowling following her latest Pottermore revelation. Our correspondent Joanna Mitchells is on the ground. Joanna?\"\n\n\"Thanks, Dave. What we're seeing now is just absolute chaos - just horrible bedlam and pandemonium. In a sudden and unprecedented retconn, Rowling just revealed two hours ago that the fictional basis for the entire Harry Potter franchise, which spans eleven books and thirteen films, four still in the works, is in fact nothing more than just a shared pipe dream among Harry, Ron and Hermione, who are the main protagonists of the film. Rumours that the Pottermore site had been hacked were rife, but Rowling herself followed up with a series of Twitter posts successively describing what pundits worldwide are calling the 'biggest scandal in publication history'. \n\nThe streets of Scotland are pouring now with bereaved and angry fans, many of whom appear to have formed an impromptu candelight vigil. Traffic is backed up for kilometers along the area, rioting is breaking out in certain neighbourhoods, and we're getting reports that the mayor has convened an emergency meeting to discuss bringing in military pacifiers. The grief is palpable and there's a feeling of lost regret and nostalgia among the participants - in fact, let's talk to one of the fans now.\n\nHi! I'm Joana Mitchells, reporting with the BBC, covering this unique protest. How did you feel when you heard the news?\n\n\"I was just so damn hurt - so shook up, ya know? Harry Potter was my *life* growing up - like we'd go to Hogwarts-themed Halloweens, you know? I *bleep*ing lined up for Order of the Phoenix. I mean, first Harper Lee published that stupid sequel to *To Kill a Mockingbird* and then R. R. Martin did that thing to Hodor and now this? I just - I just can't take it anymore, you know?\"\n\n\"That's understandable. What are you dressed as, by the way?\"\n\n\"I'm a house elf. Like, I'm Dobby. Because I just got stabbed in the heart for being so loyal. I don't think anyone's ever going to forget tonight. Not even socks are going to set us free.\"\n\n\"Err - okay. Thanks Rowling's just said that she plans to donate all the existing Harry Potter books to Comic Relief, the charity she's teamed up in the past, and write a sober follow-up book charting out exactly how the social system allowed Harry, Ron and Hermione to spiral down the cracks. What's your response?\"\n\n\"Are you serious?! Oh my *bleep*ing - hey, hey, John, she's writing another *bleep*ing book! LIKE AN ACTUAL BOOK ABOUT THE DRUG STUFF! Freaking unbelievable, man. She wouldn't stop publishing after Deathly Hallows, that was bad enough, then she just - this has got to be the worst way to end 2016, just like - man, heads are going to Rowl tonight...\"\n\n\"Thank you so much for answering my questions. Dave, back to you?\"\n\n\"Thanks for that scintillating report, Joanna. Social media is blowing up, with the hashtag PotterSmokesPot and Potgate trending on both Twitter and Facebook. The Pope has just released a press statement urging his followers to stay calm and with equal temperament, with a reminder that God will heal all wounds, magical or non-magical. President-Elect Donald Trump Tweeted 'good riddance to bad rubbish - don't need our kids learning witchcraft anyway', prompting outcry and backlash from both members of the alt-right and liberal media - it looks like the issue of the Potgate scandal has managed to unite, if temporarily, a divided country. \n\nSome of the things people are saying - we have a slideshow of the most popular - here's a picture of Alan Rickman ooking tearful, with the caption 'Always' - an angry emoji and the words 'we solemnly swear we're upto no good' that the Black Lives Matter - hold on, hold on...\n\nWow. Breaking news: the hacktivist group Anonymous has just declared Rowling as their next target, saying that by choosing to make this about politics is against the virtues that Harry Potter espouses. Now Anonymous is largely decentralized, so it is possible this is just one lone fringe member choosong to be extreme - but either way, guys, this is huge. \n\nEven as we speak, the riots have spread beyond Scotland. Los Angeles is organising what appears to be the largest sit-in protest recorded against Scholastic book house, which Rowling has said urged her to come clean with the true story. In India, Hong Kong, greater Britain and parts of America, there are reports of clashes with police, armed looting and robbery - Mugglenet, originally a famous hub of Harry Potter activity, is urging everyone to just calm down, but there's an upswelling of anger and resentment that just might spill over into something bigger. Stock markets worldwide have taken a massive hit, and the British pound just went down by 20%.\n\nNext up, we have our weekly show by Stephen Colbert, but we'll keep you updated on this developing story. Follow us on Twitter, or look out for updates on our website. Until then, stay tuned.\"\n\n",

            "comment": "\u201cPass me the blots, will you\u201d said Hermione.\n\nHer breath reeked, her words were slurred, and she could do with perhaps about fifteen hours\u2019 worth of beauty sleep. Harry stumbled from his desk and proved that he was barely able to navigate his way too her, he grabbed the bedpost for support with one hand, and with the other very carefully aimed the small square of paper into her outstretched hand.\n\nHermione examined the magic paper square at length, and yet at the same time thought about nothing in particular while looking at it.\n\n\u201cWhat did you call it\u201d she asked, finally.\n\n\u201cPollyjuice potion\u201d he replied.\n\nHermione placed the strip of LSD on her tongue and swallowed, the hit would come any second, and soon she would assume the form of one of the Slitherine girls, or some such nonsense, but she had to be in the right frame of mind before she could direct the groups\u2019 mission, whatever it was.\n\nHarry made his way back to his desk and did another line. Or at least he would have, if he had not placed the fatter end of his wand inside his nose while awkwardly poking some cocaine with the thinner end. Ron had been quietly observing the behaviour of the other two for the past couple of hours behind his absurdly massive bong, and had correctly deduced that this was the greatest, most extravagant bender that the gang had ever been on. Harry and Hermione would soon pass out into a gurgling mess, he was quite sure of it, so he decided to speak up.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go do something!\u201d He said, a little too loudly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in here all night, we need to spread the love\u201d\n\n\u201cnuh-uh\u201d said Harry \u201cI\u2019ve had bad times\u201d\n\n\u201cGuys, look at this wizard shit\u201d piped Hermione, she flumped from her bed and went over to the window, and started giggling to herself before examining the glass. Wasn\u2019t it just beautiful how the rain ran down it? She put her hand up to it, it felt like how a gentle force field would look like, she surmised, retardedly.\n\nAfter about five minutes of her pontificating, but at the same time not really thinking about much at all, Hermione spied a raggedy old man running down the corridor on the other side of the dorm. He had a fly swatter and was trying fervently to beat the living daylights out of something in the air. It was Dumbledore!\n\n\u201cGuys look! Come here\u201d She exclaimed \u201cThe old fart cast a Wingardium Leviosa spell on his slipper again! He\u2019s chasing it down the corridor, we need to help! \n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Malfoy is just tugging it on a piece of string again\u201d retorted Ron \u201cleave him to it\u201d \n\n\u201cFuck you Ron\u201d Harry sputtered and jittered from his seat. He rose from his chair too quickly, as if he hadn\u2019t had the keen sense to control his own body. The chair fell backwards and smacked the ground hard, the following thwack startled Harry and he kicked the chair over and over again in response. \u201cfuck you, fuck you, fuck you!\u201d then he cried because his parents were dead.\n\nHermione and Ron were all too familiar with this behaviour. Harry had taken a little too much magic potion and Ron rushed to his side to comfort him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok hero, come on, put your hand round my shoulder, I\u2019ve got you\u201d\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t having any of it, he curled up into a little ball at the end of his bed, Ron couldn\u2019t quite see, but he could hear Harry squirming and he was quite certain he was trying to crawl underneath his bed again.\n\n\u201cFor fucks sake Harry! Just because it\u2019s claustrophobic down there doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be like Pivot Drive!\u201d \n\nHe could just about hear Harry blubber \u201cI liked it under the stairs\u201d\n\n\u201cFine! Fuck you then! I\u2019m going to help Dumbledore, if you\u2019re going to be such an arsehole\u201d and soon, Ron was gone. ",

            "comment": "The three of them each took a hit of acid and laid down to wait for its effects to kick in.\n\n\"You guys remember last time? Man, we were fighting the Grindle guy, and there was the wand breaking, but I just zapped him, dude. It was crazy,\" Ron said. His eyes were closed and his speech was already dreamily slow. \n\n\"Yeah, dude, I remember that. And we shoved a wand up his ass-crack! Haha, that dude is really gonna feel it when we check up on him today!\" Harry added on. It was always the ass with Harry, Hermione noted, carefully observing his fingers this go around to hopefully avoid what was an impromptu rectal exam last trip when they each decided to try a slip and slide in their delusions.\n\n\"Watch where you're stickin' those wands, boys!\" Hermione said. \"Wouldn't want your wand to get warts.\" It was always metaphors with her. Ever since being abused as child, she shied around the topic while trying to appear nonchalant, but sadly, the dildo suctioned to her stomach did little to make her appear so, rather turning her visage into that of a sex-crazed crack head. Despite the fact, the mirror spoke its lies, and her self-esteem couldn't be higher (neither could the penis, really!) \n\nSo the three of them laid there, tripping out while Dumbledore, more commonly known as Carl, sat at their window, creepily peering within, having a 'trip' of his own outside, slowly painting the once brown walls white. His peeping got him only so far as his energy got the best of him and he knocked his head against the glass. The three turned their heads quickly to look at the noise, but too soon had he ducked under the window sill and shoved his face into his own paint had they seen a flit of his wispy hair, and so they turned back around thoroughly enjoying the trip and forgetting the old man.\n\nA loud bang on the door jarred them to cognition as the cops now eyed them, the window looking rather flimsy against the officer's raised baton.\n\n*Crash*\n\nThe window broke, and so did Hermione's water. The two boys dashed out of the house while she laid there, eyeing the cops with them equally eyeing her belly.\n\n\"Call an ambulance! She's going into pregnancy!\" one of them yelled, as she slowly eyed the officers around her. They had fallen for the ole 'water balloon up the cooch trick', a timeless classic offering countless goofs, gafs, and moist pants. \n\nThe men stood awkwardly around her as she eyed each of them, being mindful to keep her legs as far apart as possible to make them avert their eyes. \n\n\"I'll be in the other room,\" one of them said, and the others were soon to follow. She waited till their footsteps stopped and their bated whispers began about the absolutely raunchy dame before she began climbing through the broken window.\n\nOnce outside, she met her two amigos on the side of the house, each of them leaning up against the panelling like they were tilted on their backs.\n\n\"Woah, bro, this is like, totally gnar gnar,\" Ron said.\n\n\"I know, right, dude? Totally radical.\"\n\nAnd so the three of them began their long trek to the closest Waffle House, each of them frolicking on their ponies and pausing to examine the wonders, all of which were imaginary. \n\n---\n\nThis story was really weird, but sometimes you just gotta let the story take control and write where it takes you. I want to let you know something if you are reading this. \n\nYou are loved. You are cared about. You matter. Please do not be a stranger. If you are in need of support, reach out and grasp on to life, and lead it to where you want it. You are the captain of your fate. \n\nMuch love, and have a GREAT day :)",

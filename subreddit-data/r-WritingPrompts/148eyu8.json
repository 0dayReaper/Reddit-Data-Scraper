And Spiderman always has these cool gadgets, I'm sure that takes a LOT of capital to set up properly.\"\n\n\"Dude... Bruce Wayne lives in Gotham City. Spiderman is only ever seen in New York. It makes zero sense that they're the same person. Why would Bruce Wayne even bother patrolling around New York when Gotham City is already such a clusterfuck of villains?\"\n\n\"We already have Batman! And the fucking Justice League! You think we need another superhero here? The Friendly Neighbourhood Spiderman ain't gonna get any of the glory catching purse snatchers and robbers here. And you don't think Bruce has a private jet to fly to New York whenever he wants?? I'm telling you man, Bruce Wayne is Spiderman.\"\n\n\"Alright alright, you're not a hundred percent wrong there. But like, even if that's true, why would that even matter? Let Bruce have his fun helping people!\"\n\n\"Yo I've been listening to this podcast by this guy called J. J. Jameson, he's got all these theories about Spiderm-\"\n\n\"Dude what the fuck's going on? Are you okay? I didn't get high but you look like you're disappearing. WAIT WHAT THE FUCK.\"\n\nTV: \"This just in, we have some terrible news to deliver. People are disappearing all over America and the rest of the world. We believe this is caused by the snap of Thanos that we have all feared. Among those lost are  New York and America's most beloved hero, Spiderman, and countless of our loved ones. If you or anyone you know needs any support in this trying time, please call the number displayed below. In other news, local playboy billionaire Bruce Wayne has just declared to donate funds to those who are currently suffering from this tragedy.\"\n\n\".... I told you so.\"",

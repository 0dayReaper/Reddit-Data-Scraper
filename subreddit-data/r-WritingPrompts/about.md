Description:

Writing Prompts. You're a writer and you just want to flex those muscles? You've come to the right place! If you see a prompt you like, simply write a short story based on it. Get comments from others, and leave commentary for other people's works. Let's help each other.

Rules:

Prompt responses must be good-faith attempts at new stories/poems (No AI): * 100 words minimum for stories, 30 for poems but include [Poem]
* Newly written by you for the prompt (no AI)
* Plagiarism will result in a ban
* No joke, copypasta, or AI-generated responses
* For off topic/clarification, reply to the sticky comment

No explicitly sexual themes; other harmful content: * No explicit sexual responses / erotica
* Includes, but is not limited to, forms of pedophilia, bestiality, incest, rape, suicide, violence against children, and explicit torture
* Avoid racism and detailed uses of suicide, mental health stereotypes, and political debate
* Use your best judgment, but mods have final say

Be civil in discussion,  feedback, and critiques: * Users are held to a higher standard here. Think before posting
* We are here to encourage writing
* Understand that people here are at all different levels:
 * New writers
 * Experienced writers
 * Professional writers
 * Users who are just learning English
* Typos and grammatical errors are possible.  Be nice if you point it out
* Feedback and critiques are encouraged, but just saying something's bad is not helpful at all and will be considered trolling

All submissions must be tagged: All submissions must start with *one* capitalized **tag** in **square brackets**:

* [WP] - **Writing Prompt**
* [SP] - **Simple Prompt**
* [EU] - **Established Universe**
* [CW] - **Constrained Writing**
* [TT]  - **Theme Thursday**
* [MP] - **Media Prompt**

No recent reposts, even if changing small details: * Search before submitting! (Popular ideas can cause floods)
* Reposts are allowed, given time (around two weeks)
* Don't take a recent prompt and change/invert small details

Prompt in title, avoid commissions/games: * Prompt in the title and only use text for commentary or links for [IP]s and [MP]s.  Avoid [too many details](http://goo.gl/6v3rGd)
* No requesting writing or editing services, or homework help
* Don't post ads without getting permission in modmail first
* Don't ask writers to pick titles or content from another sub or site
* Prompts should not call for using autocorrect, autocomplete, or only emojis

No posts likely to end in rule-breaking comments: * Avoid real world drama (including politics, recent tragedies)
* Inspire an effort, avoid simple questions, "write anything", or fill-in-the-blanks
* Don't ask for preexisting content (prompts are meant for new writing)
* No explicitly sexual themes, hate speech, or other harmful content (including hate speech, racism, politics, necrophila, pedophila, bestiality, incest, torture, rape, violence against children, suicide, and mental health stereotypes)
* No troll, poop, or meme-based prompts

Keep it about writing, not competing/making money: * Wait until prompt is 24 hours old before linking from other subs to avoid vote manipulation and/or brigading (Text posts OK with no link and links *from* a story *to* another sub are fine)
* Don't spam the subreddit with links to crowdfunding sites like Patreon and Paypal.  Authors are free to link to those from their personal subreddits
* Any recording or use of other people's stories must follow the [guidance in the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/faq)

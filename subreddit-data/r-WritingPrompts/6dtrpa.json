            "comment": "\u201cIs this really necessary?\u201d\n \nThe man with the snow white beard just smiled. \u201cOf course not, Mark, I\u2019m not going to force you to do anything. Just consider it...ah the wisdom of an old man.\u201d \n \nI rolled my eyes. I would have dismissed the man as insane, but there was something behind those sparkling blue eyes that was completely, utterly sane. Well, that and the crisp wool suit he wore. I mean, what kind of insane dude wears a suit? \n \n Regardless, he was willing to pay 10,000 dollars for me to jump into this pool. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not desperate guy, I have a steady job and a decent two bedroom apartment to myself. But 10,000 dollars is 10,000 dollars. \n \nAnd thus, there I was, with floaters on my arms and shorts in the backyard of an old dude\u2019s house. I looked at him, and he gave me an encouraging smile, gesturing towards the pool. \n \nHere goes nothing I guess. \n \nI took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and jumped into the pool...and kept going. I had expected to scape my elbows or at least a jarring stop. But nothing like that happen, I kept going deeper and deeper. It was complete instinct that I began to kick upwards, towards the surface.\n \nWhen I could finally breathe again, I gaped out loud. I wasn\u2019t in a pool anymore, I was in the ocean, with nothing but water around me. I could only gape as a wave came and hit me squarely in the face. I coughed, choking, and was immediately thrown underwater. I was drowning, couldn\u2019t breathe, so cold\u2026\n \nAir. \n \nI opened my eyes and I was flopping on the grass. I blinked water out of my eyes, not tears mind you, and blearily got to my feet, wobbling as I did. I coughed a bit, trying to get water out my lungs, and a hand patted me on the back gently. I turned around to find the old man there, smiling. \n \n\u201cWhere...how, what the hell!?\u201d was all I could manage before descending into coughing fits again. \n \nAgain, the man smiled. \u201cYou, Mark, are the first human to be able to travel through a translocational portal.\u201d\n \n\u201cA what now?\u201d \n \n\u201cTranslocational portal. It must be a mutation in your genome that lets you get past their genetic lock check.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey? Who do you mean?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s irrelevant Mark. What\u2019s important is that I can tell you after you accept our offer for 100 million dollars.\u201d\n \nI could only gape at him. That much money\u2026\n \n\u201cTake your time, it\u2019s no sma-\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n \nThe old man raised an eyebrow, then smiled, like a kid for whom Christmas had come early. \n \nSomething told me I was going to grow sick of that expression very quickly.\n***\n\n(minor edits)\n\n\nIf you enjoyed, check out [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) for more of my work",

            "comment": "John swung his arms back and forth, preparing himself mentally. He glared at the plastic kiddie pool, which was filled with maybe 4 inches of dirty water. He would've found the situation stupid and maybe kind of funny, if he weren't scared shitless.\n\n*\"Again.\"*\n\nHe took a deep breath and plunged himself into the kiddie pool.\n\nInstead of hitting his head on the bottom of the shallow puddle, he found himself in a vast body of water, like a sea or an ocean. Wiping the water from his face, he took a long glance around. Nothing but quiet water and blue sky in all directions to the horizon. The sun shone down on him, but not too intensely. A shiver went through his body, partly from the cold water and partly from the feeling of being alone in the middle of a watery nowhere. Not even a bird cried in the still air.\n\nHis earpiece crackled. *\"What do you see?\"*\n\n\"Same as last time,\" he replied. \"Water, just water.\"\n\n*\"Are the skies clear?\"*\n\n\"Um...no. There are some clouds,\" John admitted. \"So I guess that's a difference.\"\n\n*\"What kind of clouds?\"*\n\n\"The hell? I have no idea, I'm not a--\"\n\n*\"How high is the sun, relatively speaking? Compared to last time?\"*\n\nJohn squinted at the brightness for a few seconds. \"I guess it's a little closer to the horizon now.\"\n\n*\"Noted.\"*\n\n\"What? What does that mean, the sky being different or whatever?\" \n\n*\"Passage of time. Every time you go to the Other Sea, some time has passed.\"*\n\n\"Oh, OK. But I'm being, uh, transported to the same place every time?\"\n\n*\"Unclear. Water does not make a good landmark.\"*\n\n\"Right.\" John waited a minute, but no more words came. He started dog-paddling in one direction.\n\n*\"What are you doing?\"*\n\n\"Moving around. Maybe I can swim around and see-AAAAH SHIT SHIT OH MY G--\"\n\n*\"John? What happened?*\n\n*\"John, all we hear are water sounds. Are you underwater? Can you hear us?\"*\n\n\"HOLY SHIT! GET ME THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!\"\n\n*\"Calm down, John. We are pulling in the safety rope now. Tell us what happened.*\"\n\n\"Something fuckin' pulled me down under!\"\n\n*\"Into the water?\"*\n\n\"Yeah, shit! Shit! It was, I don't even know. Some sort of huge monster thing. Glowing red eyes, looked fucking evil. With tentacles or fins everywhere.\"\n\n*\"It had tentacles and/or fins?\"*\n\n\"I think so. I couldn't get a good look because I was trying not to die. Shit, I lost one of my flippers.\"\n\n*\"Don't worry about that, John. The unknown entity is gone now?\"*\n\n\"I guess. I sure fuckin' hope so. Hey, I'm getting nervous, why aren't you guys pulling me out yet?\"\n\n*\"There seems to be a little problem. The safety rope appears to be severed.\"*\n\n\"What!? That's a big fucking problem! Why didn't you tell me this!?\"\n\n*\"Keep your calm, John.*\"\n\n\"Easy for you to say when you're--\"\n\n*\"...John? We lost you again. What happened? Are you alright?\"*\n\nOnce again, John stared with horror at the monstrosity. It was only for a split second as he was struggling, and it was too darkly colored, melding in with the inky blackness of the ocean deep. But those eyes. They pierced into his heart like ice.\n\nThe next second, he found himself back in the kiddie pool, gasping for breath and screaming hoarsely as he leapt out onto the ground, clutching at the hose and grass and dirt, anything to get out of that nightmare. He could still feel the tug of something on his leg, and he kicked wildly. A specialized emergency response team burst into the yard, grabbing at John and pulling him out further. His leg was covered in angry red welts, all circular in shape. The personnel assisting him reported that they saw something in the kiddie pool, something impossibly huge and fleshy and writhing, but just for a second before the water became clear once more.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________\n*Liked that?

Any personnel attempting to utilize the item without authorisation are to be terminated immediately. All personnel wishing to use the item are required to submit a filled copy of the application form (Document #120-23) to facility operators.\n\nDue to the precise timing and coordination required for efficient use of this\nobject in an emergency, all personnel entering SCP-120\u2019s building are placed\nunder temporary command of the facility heads Captain \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (Security\nDetachment) (L4) and Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (Research Team) (L4).\n\nAll destination locations are to be kept under surveillance and armed guard.\nThey are valuable to the Foundation but are non-critical, but any compromised\ndestination must be immediately reported to SCP-120 personnel.\n\nDistributed Task Force Sigma-6 (\u201cPuddlejumpers\u201d) was created with the\nobjective of protecting and maintaining SCP-120\u2019s facility and location\noutposts. It consists of 1 command unit and 1 defense and maintenance unit\nbased at the SCP-120 facility at Command-\u2588\u2588; 5 units based at the destination\nlocations, plus 5 reserve units for these; and 5 units assigned to other\nSCP-120 related projects.\n\n**Description:** SCP-120 appears to be a small child\u2019s paddling pool, pastel pink in colouration, with an inner diameter of approximately 2.5 metres and inner height of 0.3 metres. The pool appears to have been fabricated from common Earth plastics but has shown itself to be indestructible by any attempted means (see research report #120-32 for a full summary). The pool\u2019s structure and response to pressure are typical for such a pool (it will flex when pressure is applied and is soft to the touch) but has amazing tensile strength and cannot be permanently stretched or ripped.\n\nWhat is contained within the pool seems to be a brightly glowing, coloured,\nliquid-like substance, which seems to exist only partially in our dimension.\nIt is unresponsive to manipulation by organic or inorganic means, but the\nsubstance ripples and shimmers systematically and regularly, suggesting it\nexists physically on another dimension.\n\nSCP-120\u2019s most interesting and useful property is used regularly by Foundation\npersonnel. Human beings, when alive and carrying loads (including clothing)\nunder 37.8 kilograms, are observed to fall through the pool, and are deposited\nat one of 11 destinations. These will be detailed in an addendum.\n\nThe item will only function in this way if certain conditions are met: the\nsubject must be genetically human; the subject must be conscious; the subject\nmust be carrying weights of under the specified amount; and only one subject\nmust be present on the surface. Test subjects attempting to use SCP-120 while\nthese conditions were not met reported their feet making contact with a smooth\nsurface underneath the liquid but no significant effects were observed.\n\nSCP-120\u2019s main use is as a potential means of evacuation for Command-\u2588\u2588 during\na major emergency. It is currently stored and maintained in a fortified\noutbuilding of this facility. To inspect evacuation procedures, refer to\ndocument #120-22.\n\nSCP-120 was first brought to the attention of Foundation authorities on\n31/08/1992. Local police authorities in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, California, were investigating\nreports of missing children in their jurisdiction, and discovered and reported\nthe item on 31/08. Overwatch Command was automatically informed through the\nusual channels, and a small team of Foundation agents was dispatched to claim\nand transport the item to Site-19, where it remained for testing over the next\n2 years.\n\nIt was transferred to its present location at Command-\u2588\u2588 in 1994.\n\n**Addendum:**\n\n**Document #120-7: Destructive test results for SCP-120 \u2013 24/12/1993 [Abridged version]**\n\n&gt; Hand saw: 30cm \u2013 **No result**  \n&gt;  Industrial drill: Steel bit \u2013 **No result**  \n&gt;  Industrial drill: Diamond bit \u2013 **No result**  \n&gt;  Munition: 9x19mm Parabellum \u2013 **No result**  \n&gt;  Munition: 5.56x45mm NATO \u2013 **No result**  \n&gt;  Munition: 7.62x39mm \u2013 **No result**  \n&gt;  Munition: 120mm M830 HEAT \u2013 **No result**  \n&gt;  Cutting torch: Acetylene \u2013 **No result**  \n&gt;  Cutting torch: Hydrogen \u2013 **No result**  \n&gt;  Cutting torch: Propane \u2013 **No result**  \n&gt;  CO2 laser (peak power: 100 kW) \u2013 **No result**  \n&gt;  CO2 laser (peak power: 500 kW) \u2013 **No result**\n\n**Document #120-10: Detailed explanation of SCP-120\u2019s capabilities and destinations \u2013 12/02/1994 [Abridged version]**\n\nSCP-120 possesses the capability of instant translocation of human beings,\npossibly through one or more alternate dimensions. Subjects using the item are\ninvariably deposited at one of 11 locations. These locations cycle in a\nspecific and unchanging pattern. The 11 destinations and their locations were\ndetermined through testing with Class-D personnel carrying radio beacons. They\nare detailed here:\n\n**Location 1: Pacific Ocean:** SCP-120\u2019s liquid displays a blue glow while connected to this destination.\n\nSubjects attempting travel to this destination are deposited an average of 2\nmetres above the surface of the Pacific at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0S, longitude\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0W. A Foundation ship (SCPS _Demeter_ \u2013 publicly the USS _Nassau_, a\nmeteorological ship) is currently stationed at this location and personnel\narriving through use of SCP-120 materialize inside the ship\u2019s cargo hold.\n\nSensitive Foundation material or personnel can be sent here in an emergency,\nand the ship has provisions for storage of low-threat SCP objects, should the\nneed arise. Class-D personnel used to \u201cdial\u201d SCP-120 can be confined and\nextracted by helicopter or reused, or simply terminated and their bodies\nretained in storage.\n\nThe original Class D and radio transmitter used to determine this location\nwere lost at sea, and might have to be recovered in the interest of secrecy,\nif they were to wash up on populated shores.\n\nThis configuration of SCP-120 was arbitrarily designated as #1, and has no\nobservable significance above other configurations. Destinations 2 through 11\nfollow in sequential order after this configuration, and return to it after a\nfull cycle.\n\nTravel by SCP-120 to this location is not advisable during storms due to risk\nof injury.\n\n**Location 2: Greenland:** SCP-120 displays a bright white glow while dialed to this destination.\n\nSubjects travelling to this destination materialize 1.5 metres above the\nsurface of Greenland, at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N and longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0W. A\nsmall facility was established here, under the public pretense of oil industry\nexpansion. This facility has similar capabilities and use to the _Demeter_,\nand is additionally equipped with an airstrip and refueling facilities.\n\n**Location 3: L3:** Located at the Earth-Moon Lagrange Point 3. The SCP displays a deep black colour.\n\nObjects and personnel sent through the SCP to any Lagrange point (locations 3,\n5, 8, 10, and 11) are effectively lost, as retrieval is impossible at our\ncurrent level of technology. They may prove a possible way to remove small but\nthreatening SCP objects, but for now, are merely an inconvenience, as\nsacrifice of D-personnel is required to move the SCP to its next\nconfiguration.\n\n**Location 4: Himalayas:** SCP-120 displays a white glow similar to when it is dialed to Location 2.\n\nMaterialization occurs at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N, longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0E, on a\nmountain in the Himalayan mountain range. Only minor changes have been made to\nthe destination: the digging of an 8-metre hole for disposal of D-class\nbodies, an overhead canopy for concealment, and supplies and tenting for\nevacuation to this location (which should only take place in extreme\ncircumstances).\n\nD-class personnel used for dialing are to be injected with a mixture of\nsedatives and neurotoxin before sending, to ensure a humane death and decrease\nrisk of damage to the structures at Location 4.\n\n**Location 5: L5:** Identical to Location 3.\n\n**Location 6: Sahara:** SCP-120 will glow yellow.\n\nPersonnel materialize at latitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N, longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0E in a\nsmall outpost. The need for secrecy renders this facility unable to house any\nsignificant SCP object, but is ideal for evacuation of personnel and documents\nfrom Command.\n\n**Location 7: Gobi:** SCP-120 displays a brown glow.\n\nThis destination is located at a small outpost in the Gobi desert, latitude\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0N, longitude \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0E, but is otherwise identical to the\nlocation 6 outpost.\n\n**Location 8: L2:** Identical to Location 3, although shows more potential for SCP disposal, being situated beyond the moon.\n\n**Location 9: Mare Imbrium:** The SCP displays a subdued grey glow when dialed in to this destination.\n\nThis destination is on a relatively flat section of the Sea of Rains on the\nlunar surface. Through vast expenditure of money and D-class personnel, a\nsmall outpost has been established there, and is considered one of the\nFoundation\u2019s safest locations.\n\n**Location 10: L4:** Identical to Location 3.\n\n**Location 11: L1:** Identical to Location 3.\n\n\n---\nI am a~~n anomalous entity~~ bot.

Feedback appreciated.)\n\n\n\"I think it's time I go again.\" thought Henry. It'd been years since he last did it. Years since he stashed his pool away. His pool that'd take him to any beach in the world. Any beach in the world, a dive away. And now, his old bones had grown weary of being lazy for years, listening to the ruckus of his extended family. \n\nIt was time to go. He'd had his share of love and fun. He'd had his share of laughter and hugs. But at some point, he grew tired of it all. He longed to be alone. He longed for quiet days and peaceful nights. He wanted nothing but to slow his life down to a mere whisper. \n\nHe knows his family only means well. They take good care of him. But he didn't want to be taken care of. He could manage on his own just fine. He wanted the privacy of his life returned. They'd all come in to be a part of his life since Grace had gone. The pool was their little secret. They'd spend days on beaches around the globe,  not a care in the world. But now, it was stashed away.\n\n\"Not for much longer.\" He thought. The family will be fine. They might grieve him for a while. Send out search parties, have prayer meetings and what not. Then they'll accept it that he's gone. \n\nAs for him, he'll float on beaches around the world. Soak in the sun. And when he's had his fill, he'll swim out into the sea and let her take him. The sea will take him to Grace. \n\n\"Yes, it's time I go.\" He thought, as he walked back to the front door. ",

If I may critique:\n\nI think the biggest issue I had with it is all the exposition. This may be more applicable for a longer, fleshed out story, as opposed to a quick answer to a writing prompt, but showing rather than telling is always the best. It's just too much information and background in too few words - nothing wrong with taking a little time to get there. For example, instead of just saying that the pool would take him to any beach in the world, spend a nice paragraph describing different destinations he might've visited, perhaps by him remembering back to those times. In those memories, he might show his longing for quiet days and peaceful nights, as you described in the next paragraph.\n\nJust my two cents. Keep writing!",

It was really big and... oceany. Like, there was a big wave and I lost my...\"\n\nHe looked down at his foot. The color drained from his face as he started frantically searching.\n\n\"It's not here, it's not here! It's there! It's there, I know it!\"\n\n\"Arnie, relax. What isn't here?\"\n\n\"My flipper! My flipper isn't anywhere, because it's there! It's there!\"\n\n\"Ya kicked it off over that way.

It's nowhere, it's there!\"\n\n\"Dude, chill. Let me look.\"\n\nJack pulled him out of the bushes and began searching.\n\n\"You just, you just knocked it somewhere else when you fell,\" he said when he couldn't find the flipper, \"help me look.\"\n\nThe two fanned out, searching all the foliage in the surrounding area. When they were certain it wasn't there, Arnold began to have a meltdown.\n\n\"It's not here! It's not here! It's not here! It's there! It's there! It's there! I saw it, it's there!\"\n\n\"Arnie, relax! Maybe a-\"\n\n\"What, 'maybe a squirrel took it'? Is that what you were gonna say? A squirrel just decided he wanted to go for a swim and thought that my flipper was the best way to go about that?\"\n\n\"No! Just, just listen! Maybe...\"\n\nHis voice trailed off when he saw the kiddie pool. Arnold followed his friend's gaze to the sight of his flipper floating leisurely on top of the water.\n\n\"IT CAME BACK! IT CAME BACK FROM THERE!\"\n\n\"We- we just overlooked it.\"\n\n\"You said you saw it fly into these bushes!\"\n\n\"It... I must have just... mis-seen.\"\n\n\"'Mis-seen'!?\" Arnold pleaded as his friend walked toward the flipper. \"How can you 'mis-see' something like that!?\"\n\n\"I don't-\"\n\nJack's voice was cut off when he grabbed the flipper. He was engulfed by the sounds of large waves and a sea breeze. He looked back at Arnold, who appeared to be yelling something at him but wasn't making any sound. Jack let go of the flipper when another man slapped him on the back. The sound of the world rushed back to his ears.\n\n\"Hey, man! How's the 'spirit quest' goin'?\" Jack recognized the voice as his friend, Jacob's, but he was too stunned to look towards him. \"Puttin' that stuff to good use, I see. How much have ya had?\" \n\nJack shook his head. \"I- I haven't... I need to go.\" he choked out as he ran into the house.\n\n\"What was that about?\" Jacob realized he wouldn't be getting a reply as he heard both his friend's engines turn on.\n\n\"Whoa, Jack, you forgot your flipper!\" He said, reaching into the pool.\n\nEdit: Changed 'Arnie' to 'Jack' in the last sentence.",

            "comment": "#\"The Kiddie Pool\"\n\nStanding there, the too-tight floaties nearly cutting off circulation around my upper arms, I had only one thought running through my head.\n\nParenthood makes you do crazy, ridiculous things.\n\nI glanced back over my shoulder, turning to look at Brandon.  The flippers on my feet meant that I had to do a stupid, ridiculous little penguin-shuffle to rotate, and I knew that, if any of my office buddies could see me right now, they'd be laughing their asses off.  I'd be the butt of all the water cooler jokes for weeks.\n\n\"Now, you're still convinced that the pool's too deep and scary,\" I said again to Brandon, hoping that maybe the six-year-old's mercurial mind had changed since the last time I asked him, five minutes earlier.\n\nBut he nodded, a single, firm jerk of his head.  \"Yes, daddy,\" he answered, blinking solemn dark eyes beneath the head of too-long hair.  Wasn't Helen supposed to have taken him to get that trimmed?  Did I really need to do everything, just because she was too busy flirting on dating sites instead of-\n\nI took a deep breath.  Put it out of your mind.  Be a good dad.  Don't let the divorce hurt your relationship with your son.  \n\n\"And me going into the pool,\" I continued, \"dressed in all this,\" and I gestured down at the floaties, the flippers, the ridiculous getup, \"will convince you that it's safe to splash around.\"\n\nAnother nod.  Those dark eyes watched me, and I felt his total attention on me, that level of focus that only little kids can achieve.  When he looked at me, I knew that I was his world.  He trusted me, believed in me.  Somehow, all the other shit didn't feel quite so bad, when he looked at me like that.\n\nI turned back around to the kiddie pool.  Shuffle, shuffle of the rubber flippers.  I looked down at the pool.  It was the inflatable kind, and I'd spent half the morning sweating and cursing as I worked the pump and wished that I'd paid the extra thirty bucks for the electric pump version.  Out in the sunlight in on the too-thin, weedy grass of my backyard, it held maybe a foot or so of sun-warmed water.\n\nThis might feel nice, I told myself.  Step in, cool off a little, then come out and let the kid splash for a bit while you grab a beer.  A good Saturday afternoon.\n\nI glanced over at Brandon, who watched me.  I put on a big, fake smile.  I was going to hate the day when the kid figured out that most of my smiles had pain behind them.  \n\n\"Here goes nothing,\" I said cheerily, flopping forward into the ten inches or so of water-\n\nI was underwater.  I struggled, flailing my arms, seeing the light above me.  That had to be the surface.  My lungs screamed for air; I hadn't pulled a full breath before flopping in.  I came up, and...\n\nAnd...\n\nThe first thought, finally pulling itself together in my head, was bewildered.  *The kiddie pool wasn't deep enough for me to need to tread water,* it said.\n\nI wasn't in the kiddie pool.\n\nI was... was it an ocean?  What the hell?  I spun around, splashing and kicking my feet to keep my head above water.  All I could see, in all directions, was water.  The sun burned brightly above me, shining down, its glare reflected off the sea around me.  And it was a sea - thrashing, I turned in a circle, water splashing everywhere from my panicked kicks.  No land.  Just water.\n\nI opened my mouth to shout out, to let out a raw sound of angry bewilderment - and a wave hit me, forcing me down under the surface.\n\nIt burned.  Everything burned - my lungs, my face, the cut on my jaw where I cut myself shaving this morning, the muscles in my flabby legs as I tried to kick and swim.  I felt my foot twist, and amid the bubbles and confusion underwater, I saw one flipper fly away, loose from my foot.\n\nShit.  I was going to die.  I was going to drown, out here in this ocean, and Brandon would have to go live with Helen and she'd never listen to a thing that the kid said-\n\nNo.  I fought my way up, past the burning in my chest and throat and nose and head.  Up towards the light, up through the bubbles, the crashing waves that kept shoving me under, again and again, like those bullies back in seventh grade, back down into the water until I couldn't breathe, couldn't even scream-\n\nLight.  *Air.*  Reassuring solid ground under my feet, imbalanced as I stumbled forward.  Rubber hit my ankles and then I was out of the pool, falling to my knees on the crabgrass, my blindly clutching hands bumping against the hose that I'd used to fill the pool.\n\nI gasped in air, tasted its sweetness.  I blinked water out of my eyes.  It ran down my back, my shirt plastered against my body.  It soaked into the dirt and made sand stick to my scraped knees.\n\n\"Oh my god,\" I groaned out.\n\n\"See, daddy?\"  I looked up, blinked water out of my eyes, as Brandon stepped around to me.  I was back, I realized, back on the ground in front of the kiddie pool.  \"It's too deep.\"\n\nStill struggling to suck in air, to fully fill my starved lungs, I looked at him.  I shifted my gaze over his shoulder, at the kiddie pool still squatting there so innocently.  Down at my feet, mismatched with only a single flipper still attached.\n\nI should do something.  Scream, get some gasoline, set the thing on fire.  But Brandon was looking at me, and I tried to pull myself together.  Be a good dad.\n\n\"How about I set up the sprinkler, instead?\" I asked.\n\nA long moment of consideration, and then a single nod.  \"Yeah.  I like the sprinkler.\"",

Carlow had always been skeptical of Merlin, who had claimed to be a reincarnated wizard legend from a thousand years ago. But a gut feeling brought him to accepting Merlins request to take him on as an apprentice. Well, up until now anyway.\n\n\"Hey Merlin..\" Carlow called. \n\nMerlin didn't answer. He was sitting on a fold up chair and giggling to himself as he scrolled through his smartphone. \n\n\"HEY!!\" Carlow yelled. Merlin finally looked up. \n\n\"Dude, Carlow you gotta check out this me-me on your world wide internet called a me-me. This guy named Brian had the worst luck!

It felt just like yesterday when I stole a holy grail during the crusade-\"\n\n\"MERLIN.\"\n\n\"Right right. Anyway man today, YOU get to harness the power of memories\"\n\n\"memories?\" Carlow asked\n\n\"Yeah. Memories.\" said Merlin in a serious tone for once \"The place where someone can live forever, where a moment never ends, you can harness your memories and even those from others for spells.\" \n\n\"So.. how? And what's that pool for?\"\n\n\"Well, don't take this to wrong way but I checked your favorite memories. You used to love going to La Jolla with your dad didn't you?\" \n\n\nCarlows face went blank. ''Used to\" and \"dad\" were two words that he could never get used\nTo in the same sentence even after all these years. His throat started to swell and a deep pressure inside of him started building up. \"How? How did you-\" he asked with a shaky voice. \n\n\n\"I'm a wizard, Harry\" Merlin said with a deep rhapsody voice. \"But that's what I wanted to see, your passion. The fire inside you! I knew this place would you feeling some emotions. Forgive me, but for the sake of of this lesson I'll need you to practice with that memory\"\n\n\n\"Practice what?\" Carlow asked. \n\n\n\"To teleport\" said Merlin enthusiastically \"with the help of memories, you'll jump to SoCal all the way from Baltimore, okay? Just think long and hard about it and say this spell: __________\\\\____. Trust me. I'll pull you back here before you know it\"\n\n\nCarlow took a deep breath. He had mixed emotions. Part of him would be glad to be a part of the secret world of magic and to see the old spot him and his dad would go years back. \n\nBut another part was hoping Merlin would be a fraud so he could stop wasting his time. \n\nBut now was  to take a plunge. Was Merlin serious? Would he actually teleport? The spell was ___________. Say it before you jump in. Or was it when you were already in? Or say it on a count of 3. But if they did that then would it be on three or like 1,2,3 Go!\n\nCarlow recited it, stood in front, and a small leap inside. But then... (ops gif)\n\n\n\n\n",

It was my son's 4th birthday. All he wanted was a pool. A goddamn pool. I looked all over and all they had was girly shit. I had to settle for the manliest girly thing I could find, a purple plastic pool with light green sea turtles. I could tell you the smell coming off that pool if I had some time to think about it. I remember everything from that day. Every breath I took. Every blink I blinked. It was the worst day of my life. My son just turned 4. He loved the water. He's the only fucking kid I've ever seen who loves bath time. I knew he would love this. I got the pool to my house. My wife and he were outside. He was tame until he saw that pool. That fucking pool. He knew it was for him, he could just see it in my eyes. He wanted in that thing the moment he laid eyes on it. I told him to wait and let it fill up before he got in it, so he did. Almost full, I can see the reflection of the water bouncing off the side of the pool. He was so excited and ready to take a dip in his brand new pool. He was just ready to jump in when I told him to wait so I can fetch my camera. I jogged to the house looking for it, took me all of about 10 minutes to find that thing. I came back out, grinning from ear to ear when he was nowhere to be seen. The hose was still in the pool. His shoes were beside it. His floaties were in the water. But he was nowhere to be seen. It was just me there. My wife had left a little earlier to fetch party hats and other things I had forgotten while I was out. I was just so eager to get him that pool. I screamed his name over and over. I'm yelling so loud that my throat is immediately horse. I have absolutely no idea where he is. I look down at his shoes. So upset with myself for leaving a 4 year old by himself, I pick it up, enraged, and threw it as hard as I could. I don't know where it landed. I threw it so hard that I lost my balance and fell into the pool. That fucking pool. I closed my eyes as soon and I started falling, knowing I was heading for it. I kept sinking. There is no way this pool is that deep. I open my eyes and see absolutely nothing. The brown water was so murky and dirty that I can't see the hand in front of my face. I'm still sinking. I can't swim up just yet because I'm in shock. I can't move. I felt something hit my foot that felt like another foot. I tell myself every day that it wasn't my son's when, in all likelihood, it was.",

Yet, through all of this, it's merely a few inches. \n\n\"A few inches\", he said\u2014looking down. Even through the stench of bodily fluids that cover the air, his own scent is what worried him most.\n\n It's a kiddie pool, yet, the man couldn't get himself to do it. He hovers above the few inches, and watches as his younger sister waddles around\u2014spreading her germs, her stench throughout the air. At-least, that's what the man wants to believe.\n\n Truly, the only thing that this man has to fear is his own incompetence, and whether or not he'll crack his skull against the cemented floor.\n\n A splash, a splash, and a splash, it just won't stop, the sister, she won't stop, she just won't quit. From it, a drop drips through his trunks, so cold, like a clod of ice pouring through his skin\u2014tearing through the inner meats.\n\n He faints.\n\n He falls like a giant's last words, and gets revenge for his sister's steps. But, along with splashes of water, piles of blood, it pours through the crumbled cement, and floats along the water, and scars his sister's legs.\n\n Her screams are like a whooping cough, but, nobody's around. Nobody can see. Nobody can hear. Nobody cares. But, with her screams, she falls down the pit of water, and lays on-top of her brother.\n\n Little to her knowledge, her brother's not there anymore. He's gone, long gone, and his reddish body surrounds the little girl\u2014all over, and combining with the water\u2014dripping throughout. It wants to leave, but the sweat grabs it\u2014squeezing itself, and the blood.\n\n The brother. He only sees the brown. The brown, the mud, the wet, that's the only thing that can be felt. But, that's just feeling. Sight and sound is a screeching banshee. It's a loud bang, over and over again. It won't stop, and it won't quit, and it's relentlessly eroding away at the man's breath. Every time it gives up whipping at him, it only gives a small glimmer of what seems is hope, but merely reminds him of what happiness is. Misery can only exist with happiness, it knows that. It's always known that.\n\n His sight is darkness, then he closes his eyes, and it gets brighter only then. So, he closes his lids, and finds peace in a dark abyss. The water whips, and the noise never stops, but he's found peace. Peace in pieces of sanity.\n\n But what is peace? Why is it that he's found peace in pieces of hell? Why bother thinking of such a paradox? Perhaps that's what he's thought, but it doesn't matter, does it? Disaster surrounds him, so why bother? Why bother opening his eyes? Why bother moving his arms, swimming, thinking, breathing, it's an inevitable conclusion. When the only thing that surrounds him is darkness with no light left, there is no more reason to swim.\n\n \"Oh god\"...just a few thoughts, and he swims.\n\n The water is nothing more than darkness; an abyss of nothing, yet everything lays behind that, and peers at the man's life\u2014trying to take it.\n\n A strange noise, that of which is beyond description, it shrieks. It wails from no direction, and screeches beyond thought. It says\u2014\n\n \"Kevin!\", crying like a child.\n\n Kevin raises his blood, more so than his head. the few inches of water has spread throughout the area. It molds.\n\n Kevin, his sister, she hugs his sweaty body, with water that covers the sweat, but never gets rid of it.\n\n He raises the little girl with both his hands, and splashes the water.\n\n \"Let's get you cleaned\", he says.",

'You' are the mom of the characters. \n\nPosting this on Wattpad too, feel like continuing it for a bit!\n\nhttps://www.wattpad.com/1167037242-the-kiddie-pool-paradox-temporary-title-hottest\n\n\\---------------------------\n\n\"Look, mommy, I'm gonna jump in the pool!\"  \nToday is the hottest day of the year, or at least, that's what the newspaper says. Wanting to take advantage of the warmth while you can, you've set up all the sprinklers and filled the pool up for the kids. Your youngest, Aimon, is 4 years old, and you can tell he really wants to impress you.  \n\"Go ahead, Aimon, but make sure not to hurt yourself,\" you say, glancing up from your book. A new release. You make sure Gabriel and Shayna are still playing tag with water guns, which they are, and return your attention to Aiden when he cries, \"Daddy, look!\" Your husband Daren, who was watering the flowers, glances up from his garden. \"I'm looking, buddy,\" he says.  \nAiden takes 10 steps back, and puts his legs into a running stance. You look back at Daren, who is looking back at you with an expression that says, 'We're going to need more bandages.\" Aiden yells, \"LOOK!\" one more time, which catches the attention of his siblings. Now everyone is watching him run toward the 6-inch inflatable pool full speed. He jumps, and you wince as his knees go towards the water first - that'll make him cry - and then watch him fall right through the bottom of the pool.   \n\"Aiden!\" you shout, leaping up. Your book hits the ground with a thud, and you hear the garden hose hit the concrete. Without thinking you jump straight into the pool after your son; the last thing you hear is your daughter beginning to wail.   \nYou hit the water, and find the pressure change in your ears overwhelming. Your first instinct is to swim up, but that is quickly changed by the sound of someone else entering the water. You turn quickly, seeing the figure of Gabriel paddling desperately upwards. All thoughts of yourself and your other family is dropped. Gabriel can't swim in the current.   \nWith that thought you realize that there is, indeed, a strong current pushing against you. \"Shit,\"  you think. This'll make it harder to get to him, and you're running out of breath fast. You begin to swim towards your eldest son, when the thought comes to you again, you need air.  But you would die for your son. You swim against the current, trying desperately to reach him, but all you can do is watch as his movements grow more frantic.   \nOnce again your mind calls out to you. You need air. NOW.  Without thinking you swim upwards, your body controlling your mind, your own survival taking priority over Gabriels. The instinct takes control too late, however; You gasp for air, water filling your lungs, and are swept away by another current. You are conscious for just long enough to see a shadow figure reach out and take hold of his leg, pulling him down.",

The cuffs are slung around the frame of a wooden chair, which is facing it's back to a small pool. In front of me, is who used to be a great friend, Thompson Loorinn. He's the type of man you'd expect in the newspaper, long, thin and bearded. \n\nNoticing my struggle, Thompson grins, taking no shame in expressing his massive row of teeth. Yellow, grim teeth. \"Think about it, Jackson!\" He exclaims. \"This is the opportunity of a lifetime. No one else has ever been taken as far away from the earth as you will be in a few minutes. If anything, you should be thrilled!\" He puts his hand into the tiny pool and splashes me with the liquid. I flinch as I realise that the water is cold, to an exhilarating level. \"This was my discovery, Thompson! Me!\" I scream at him, spit flinging from my mouth. Thompson frowns and walks up close to me. *\"Listen carefully, cretin. Even I can't guarantee what's going to happen to you. All I know is that you will be sent far, far away.\"* Thompson readjusts himself, and flashes a smile. But as he strides away again, I smile to myself. Only I know that I'd be seeing him again very soon if I remained calm. *I just need to find the 'exit'.* \n\nBut during my thoughts, I suddenly feel a harsh blow to the back of my head, and the chair is pushed violently into the pool.",

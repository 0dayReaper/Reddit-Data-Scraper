            "comment": "'Excuse me, but what did you just say?' I asked the brutish green humanoid before me.\n\n'You are hereby now the ruler of the Orcish Empire,' the alien said. 'I'm duty-bound to serve as your bodyguard and advisor, Your Imperialness.'\n\nOrcs are gigantic compared to humans, their heads standing taller than anyone else in the room by at least 8 feet and saying that an orc was built like a brick shit house was a huge understatement. These creatures were fast enough to chase down speeding cars, strong enough to rip a tank in half and could take heavy artillery from most other species like they were paintball shots.\n\nNow I've never seen orcs in person before, only on TV and in movies, but even now I could tell that Brom made any other *orc* he could possibly encounter look like a slender pre-teen standing next to a professional weightlifter. We were having this conversation outside my battered old house mainly because the ten feet of steel would have to rip the wall off my house to get inside. And I was afraid he could actually do it.\n\n'*How?*' was all I could possibly ask.\n\n'Well, it's both extraordinarily complex and... surprisingly stupid,' the orc chuckled. He was constantly glancing about, making himself a wall between me and whatever threats he could possibly identify. 'Well, for the complicated parts, whatever chain of command that existed a month ago, when the previous emperor died, no longer exists. When he died he had several of his heirs disowned for being unbecoming of the orcs. War criminals and slavers, mostly. And they chose to try and take the throne for themselves, murdering the only other heirs. Due to five century of rigorous inbreeding there were no branch families.'\n\n'And how the fuck do I figure into this?!' I asked.\n\n'A barely legal star deed,' the orc said as he held up a certificate.\n\nIt was a name deed, one that lay claim to a binary star system somewhere in the Andromeda galaxy. It was registered so a man named Gerard O'Loughlin.\n\n'Your grandfather paid about $20 for his name to be given to a star,' Brom chuckled. 'It barely constitutes to ownership of the whole star... But given the dire circumstances and to prevent civil war, it's the best we've got.'\n\n'Fuck, and I'm just trying to scrape by enough funds to pay off my student loans and still have enough to eat,' I said to myself.\n\nHe brought up a holographic interface before himself and looked over records before pressing a single button. 'Payment confirmed,' Brom said. 'It's best we leave as soon as possible, sir.'\n\n'And what if the orcs don't want to acknowledge me as their leader?' I asked. 'I'm not exactly someone who would command respect in a room filled with people weighing a ton.'\n\n'Of course,' Brom said with a chuckle as he signaled me towards a vessel. 'And the gravity on Draenor will probably kill you instantly. We've got everything sorted.'",

                    "comment": "The ship had been sailing through the stars for a week, drifting past solar systems like one would sail past small ripples upon the water of the ocean. Small, meaningless overall.\n\nTo my surprise the battle cruiser had a luxury bedroom aboard, but of course it would. It was designed to transport the Imperial leader. Of course, \"Leader of a race of the universe's greatest warriors\" also meant that it had an arena and weapons training facilities from modern plasma and firearms training to use of battle-axes, swords or just good-old beating something to death with pounding, heavy fists (an excellent form of stress relief!)\n\nI, however, lay broken on the bed, stiff and unmoving with a pathetic whimper coming from my lips.\n\nBrom came into the room with a smile, an android bringing a large amount of food that would be considered enough for a feast for about fifty people, but which orcish royalty would no doubt call, \"Breakfast.\"\n\n'Good morning, sir,' he said with a smile as he instructed the robot to lay it down. 'How are you this fine day?'\n\n'I told you to stop calling me sir,' I grumbled. 'And your majesty. And anything that's so formal.'\n\n'So, how was the latest rounds of the procedure?' he asked as he turned me over, yanking me upward then resting my elbows onto my thighs. 'Even now, you'd make a fine orc.'\n\n'This is the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life,' I sighed before sitting upright to accept the boiling hot liquid Brom handed to me.\n\n'This is nothing,' Brom chuckled as I drank the ten liters of coffee. 'We still have a month to go before we arrive on the capital world and already it's come out that the next ruler would be of human origin.'\n\n'Do they know you're genetically changing me into an orc?' I asked as I grabbed some food. Orcs don't bother with utensils, especially in private. No, they just fill their hands and gnaw the heap out of their hands. I've taken to that rather well.\n\n'Oh, we're doing far more than that,' Brom said. 'Don't worry, you'll still be you psychologically. But when you land you'll be *the* pinnacle of orcish warriors.'\n\n'What does that mean?' I asked as I stood, putting my hand underneath the table and lifting it like a cheese board. It was a good way of comparing how much I had changed in merely a week, seeing how close I was to the top of my head to his beard.\n\n'It means no-one will dare say you aren't by any means an orc,' he said.\n\nI set the table down before walking towards the shower within the room. 'I am to take you down to the labs so you can hear the Thoughts of the Kings,' Brom said as the water struck my pale and green skin, jets striking with great force. 'To put it into simple terms... memories of long-dead kings will be surgically implanted into your mind. You'll learn to fight and rule like them.'\n\n'It seems this isn't just something you prepared for myself,' I said as I grabbed a bar of soap and began lathering my body, feeling the water bring my long hair over my shoulders and neck and down to the bottom of my chest.\n\n'We do not believe in abdication,' Brom answered. 'You're either an effective ruler or you're trampled upon by another ruler. Better to have a general than a Neidermeyer. My duty is to ensure that the second isn't needed.'\n\n'And to do so if that fails?' I asked as I glanced at him. 'If you need to kill me, then make it quick.'\n\n'Noted,' he said with a stoic face. Of course, he had already debriefed me about how that is precisely what he'll do to me.\n\n---\n\n'Your majesty,' the chief scientist said as I entered the lab. 'You are aware of the procedure?'\n\n'I know,' I said as I walked towards him. 'You're probably proud of making a pathetic human into the ultimate orc.'\n\n'Actually, you're one of the finer human specimens I've seen,' the lead scientist said. 'Of course, I've previously only seen humans like yourself while serving on a vessel which liberated slave colonies so they were often malnourished and...'\n\nHe grew uncomfortable as I looked at him, a smirk on my face. 'May I ask you to sit within this chair?'\n\n'Sure,' I said as I sat down. For my safety enormous shackles were put around my arms and legs, a belt around my torso before something was attached to the base of my neck. 'We're going to give you some anesthetics for this,' the scientist said.\n\n'I thought orcs didn't believe that it was worthwhile,' I repeated what he had said when I first met him. 'That we'd need far too much to be an effective means of pain relief.'\n\n'That should tell you how much this is going to hurt,' the scientist said sympathetically.\n\nI was immediately gripped in pain as electricity was shot directly into my spine, every muscle tensing.\n\n*'You dare bring a blade on a child?' I yelled at the orc drenched in blood. 'There is no honor in slaughtering a beaten man's heirs.' With a violent twist, the orc's neck was broken and he fell onto the ground, dead.*\n\nWait, that was definitely not me who did that! But... it felt like I had indeed killed him.\n\nMy body jerked again until suddenly *I was helping my youngest lad draw the string. 'Slow, calm breaths Garrosh,' I said as I helped adjust his aim. He let the arrow fly, a small glimmer in his eye as it struck the holographic target.*\n\nThat was only a service memory, I had much more crammed right into my brain. Herret, the orc in question, somehow acting like a subconscious voice telling me to remain calm.\n\nI could already feel the memory of his son Garrosh floating into my head, how orcish royal custom requires them to lead a warband in order to learn how to effectively lead. *Sometimes that required assassinations. That wasn't too unusual, I'd often send one of my men. But the client requested that the target be taken out with an archer's bow and I was the best archer we had.*\n\n*I soon learned why. I've always hated the elves, their psychic powers seemingly superior to orcish brawn but seeing what Elledan Windleaf was doing... He'd buy weakened slaves and hunt them within his estate, letting them go free if they managed to escape with their lives. The client was one such victim.*\n\n*I drew the string back, aiming the arrow as he prepared to fire at a young girl. One of those recently discovered \"Humans\", no doubt. Just reached puberty if I wasn't mistaken about this girl. I could've screamed to announce my presence, to get between the girl and the elf, to rush straight at him and rip him to shreds!*\n\n*But I'm a professional, and an Emperor's Son. Discretion was what the client asked for, and that's what the client will receive.*\n\n*The arrow struck his string just before he released the carbon fiber tube from the bow. It flopped onto the ground pathetically as the bow straightened out, his body collapsing near to a pond in the open of his estate.*\n\n*Surprisingly he wasn't dead, the arrow apparently going through a non-vital part of the brain. I did hear this human legend of a man who had a spike driven through his head via explosion so it wasn't unheard of.*\n\n*He definitely saw me, it seems. He was panicking as he began to crawl away, a wicked smile crossing my face.*\n\nThe next thing I knew I was in my quarters, an arrow striking a holographic target. I blinked once or twice, looking into my hand in confusion.\n\n'It's known to happen,' Brom said as he handed me another arrow. 'You wandered back here three hours ago. Garrosh Many-Arrows, right? That was the most vivid memory you saw?'\n\n'He assassinated an elf by shooting through his bow's arrow,' I said as I took the arrow, drew it and released it within 2 seconds, shooting a bullseye. 'It... was surreal. Like I was living it.'\n\n'I wish I knew, but that is a right only the emperor has,' Brom said as he handed me another arrow. 'Those who use the Thoughts are said to hear the voices of the kings within their heads, to closely gravitate towards their ideals. Or to have matching ones and are advised to follow them, from what has been reported to me.'\n\nI was just about to draw the bow when a thought came into my head. 'Double target distance, set target to human darts.'\n\nThe target appeared five hundred meters away, the interface appearing like a dart board. I shot three arrows towards it, smiling as it was reported that I had scored 180.\n\nBrom presented another arrow, but was confused as I handed him the bow. 'Human dart rules,' I said. 'We each take three shots, first to 501 wins the round.'\n\n'I don't know how to play,' Brom said.\n\n'I'll teach you,' I said as I pulled hum up to the shooting position. 'See, scoring a bullseye only scores you 50 points. To score the highest...'",

                            "comment": "There were numerous broken and injured orcs standing before me as I wiped my brow. Maybe a few dead ones as well. Ten minutes ago they held guns, swords, axes and hammers and were fully ready to slaughter me. One even gave me a nip just above my eyebrow.\n\n'End simulation,' I ordered the training arena, causing all the orcs to disappear before a wide table was brought into the room by an android, my bodyguard Brom following after.\n\n'You battled recreations of a hundred of our finest warriors throughout history,' Brom said with a smile. 'Definitely the skills of a king.'\n\n'It was too easy,' I said as I began wolfing down food. God, I love how elvish fabricators can produce fresh food out of nothing.\n\nBrom looked towards me with surprise. 'That was on the hardest settings,' he said.\n\n'Then make it harder,' I said while looking down at him. 'Or maybe you'd prefer to spar with me yourself.'\n\n'I... honestly wouldn't expect to survive,' he admitted, the one moment of weakness I saw within him since meeting him. 'Also, we have other business to attend to. The ship will be arriving on Draenor in just over a day. You're already acclimated to the gravity, I've ensured that. But the generals wish to put you through another simulated war game.'\n\n'Well, I can handle that,' I said after finishing the last of my meal. I placed my hand on the thick gullet, the muscular frame like a powerful Sumo. 'I would've liked to do that sprinting exercise again. Nearly reached a hundred and fifty miles per hour.'\n\n'Oh, you'll be doing that at the same time,' Brom answered, seemingly proud of anticipating this. 'I should also point out that clothing won't be necessary.'\n\n'Is that at the request of medical staff?' I asked with a mischievously raised eyebrow. 'Or the women on the bridge?'\n\n'Just don't sleep with them,' Brom warned me. 'It's unbecoming of a great leader to leave a trail of broken hearts and countless bastards. Besides, there *is* a concubine's court for that.'\n\n'I don't know,' I said as I walked into the shower. 'I think I'm still sort of into human women, you know?'\n\nHe looked over my 13 foot tall frame behind the glass, stained on his side but perfectly visible from mine, and smirked. 'If you tried it on with a human, I don't know if internal hemorrhaging or the fact an elephant is what killed them.'\n\n'Do you have experience?' I asked him.\n\n'Once had to bail one of the dumbasses under my command out of trouble after he tried to get it on with an elfish prostitute,' he said. 'He survived, by the way. The prostitute, not the private.'\n\n'You killed the private?' I asked in concern.\n\n'That's not what I meant and you know it,' he said sternly as I chuckled.\n\nThe ship was suddenly rocked, the artificial gravity being thrown out of sync. The shower's water supply was immediately cut as a safety measure but my nude frame was now floating with droplets of water surrounding me.\n\n'We've got contact with an unknown enemy,' the speakers erupted. 'Everyone to their stations! They're hostile.'\n\n'Let's go,' I said to Brom as I grabbed him and began pulling him towards the corridor.\n\n'Sorry, but I've to evacuate you,' Brom said. 'We don't know if this is an assassination but-'\n\n'You wanted an orc emperor, you're *getting* an orc emperor,' I spoke sternly. 'And I am *not* putting any pants on until I have the head of the attacker's fleet hanging from my waist.'\n\nThe gravity kicked in again, sending us crashing into the ground.\n\n'Now, prepare to board their vessel,' I said to Brom as I began sprinting towards the bridge.\n\n---\n\nThe battered Imperial dreadnought sailed into the binary star system, hailing itself and giving a distress signals. Even from the throne room I could hear the engines failing. The bridge crew were busy working, but I could tell when they glanced at me with respect, adoration and... justifiably, fear.\n\n'That was stupid and you know it,' Brom said as he stood on thick crutches. 'Diving through the vacuum of space to tear into their ship with an axe... What were you thinking?'\n\n'I was thinking I need to make an impression,' I answered Brom as I stroked a cut on my chin, already healed but leaving a scar. 'Yegoth, bring Brom back to medical.'\n\n'No way,' Brom rebuked me. 'I'm meant to be your bodyguard, your second. I won't leave your side until I'm dead.'\n\n'Then get a fucking gurney in here, then,' I ordered.\n\nSeveral smaller vessels approached with exchanges of permissions to dock. Most of them disembarked nearer the rear where engineers got to work repairing our vessel. The largest one, a frigate, docked nearer the front and one of the orcish admirals walked off and onto the bridge.\n\n'And here's why I prefer to have a doctor who *hasn't* been trained within the orcish academies,' the admiral said. 'You're rather different than the picture I received. And... why are you naked?'\n\n'We got caught in the attack when I was in the shower,' I answered. 'And I vowed not to wear any clothing until I had the attacking leader's head hanging from my waist.'\n\n'And you haven't because...?' the admiral asked in confusion.\n\n'The fabricator broke and there aren't any belts that fit me,' I said as I stood up. 'Shall we continue this within my quarters?'",

                                    "comment": "There's a very clear difference between orcs and humans, and that's how they operate on a societal level. For example, the main virtues in orcish society are personal strength and power, using that power to be an effective leader and to protect what one cares about at all cost.\n\nWhen humans first discovered genetic engineering and biological enhancements we used it only for emergencies, like removing a deadly disease like Parkinson's from one's DNA or neutering a virus that was spreading rapidly. Orcs however, especially the first conqueror Obould The Wise who established the empire and lay the foundations for ten thousand years of rule, saw it as a means of enhancing their bodies to the point where they were vastly different from orcs generations ago. He ensured that crops and wild animals could feed a society of monstrous beings and ensured that he was the greatest of them all.\n\nThere is no better place to see this than the Anvil of Obould, his great laboratory that has since been turned into a museum of the empire's great triumphs and what the world was like long ago. It is in here that the mummified remains of an orc chieftain reside, perfectly preserved in amber.\n\nHe was shorter than a human but had far more mass, a result of the gravity of this world pressing down on him. My guess, he was 5 feet at most.\n\nOf course, genetically the line lives on now - his gene sample was used as the basis for my conversion to an orc so everything from the strands of my hair, my eyes and even the shape of my enormous tusks were a perfect recreation of him. But his descendants were all dead now, the reason I was turned into this titan.\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad had his son Uzul the Foolish not began a practice of incest and inbreeding to keep Obould's bloodline \"Pure\". It was for this reason that the chieftains made a law that the king was *not* allowed to be married and that a concubine from each tribe would be provided to me.\n\nIt was one such concubine who had tried to pull me back under the sheets of the enormous bed. 'Come on back, my liege,' Shel begged in a half-sleeping manner. 'Just five more minutes?'\n\n'It's not like you could become exhausted,' Rogmesh said as she traced a clawed hand over my thigh, feeling the powerful cords underneath.\n\n'I'm sorry, my dears,' I said as I walked over towards a dresser, somewhat teasingly putting my legs through the holes of my pants. 'A king's duties are to his people. I'm already late as it is.'\n\n'You're still thinking like a human,' Morn said as she sat up. 'Orcs can be *much* faster.'\n\nThat was definitely true. It was my great shock to see that orcs rarely used cars or buses. It wasn't efficient enough to fuel a vehicle when an orc could literally run that same distance with little trouble. If an orc needed to get anywhere that was too far for their feet they'd catch a train. Otherwise, they'd run at eighty miles an hour and leap miles at a time.\n\n'You'll definitely be late if you take the time to put clothes on,' Morn continued. 'You're to show your power and strength to the young generation, why not show them *all* that power.'\n\nI tensed just as I slipped an arm into the sleeves of my T-shirt. 'There's a certain taboo regarding sexual misconduct around or aimed at children,' I said sternly. 'Tell any human in private that you that you had sex with a kid and you're going to get your ass thrown into a cell after a *severe* beating.'\n\n'I guess that's another thing humans do differently,' Shel said. 'Is there a reason?'\n\n'It's an abuse of power,' I said as I finished putting my shirt on then grabbed the thick boots. 'They're too young to know any better.'\n\nI was soon fully dressed, walking out onto my balcony and experiencing the hot breeze of a Draenor summer's morning. I crouched down, feeling the power build up within my feet before pushing off and rocketing through the air, landing with a series of skips just before the flying transport.\n\n'5 Strikens,' Brom said as he held his hand out.\n\n'Sorry,' I said as I handed him the note. 'Those women are eager.'\n\nThe transport floated through the air, zooming with little turbulence. I had the briefing last night, so I mainly flicked through TV channels on a holographic screen.\n\n'Oh, not this one,' Brom grimaced as he saw the orc sitting behind a desk. 'Carthurg Swift-Knife... He's constantly talking shit and throwing out random challenges for duels but if someone brushes even one negative comment his way, they're \"Unbecoming of Orcish Civility\".'\n\n'I tell you, it's an utter *disgrace* that this \"O'Loughlin\" fellow is being given access to the throne,' Carthurg barked on the screen. 'It doesn't matter if they gave him the blood of Obould The Wise or pumped him with the minds of every great emperor we've had, he is ***NOT!! AN!! ORC*** and we should *never* let that cheeky bastard forget that.'\n\n'Is that his phone number?' I asked Brom. 'On the bottom of the screen.'\n\n'Yes, and I pray to the Gods for every poor soul who is dedicated to his bullshit to call,' Brom said as he returned to reviewing the security detail on the school we were going to.\n\n'And we have another caller on the line,' Carthurg said. 'Your opinions on our new alleged leader?'\n\n'I think it says more for human shenanigans over these alleged \"Name deeds\" of stars that can still be honored despite being entirely symbolic and meaningless when they were first started,' I said onto the phone, causing Brom to turn up towards me with shock. 'And more importantly, the selfishness of this human. Our greatest vessel and it's crew were dedicated to keeping him safe, and this *maniac* thought it would be a good idea to dive across the vacuum of space, *naked*, instead of listening to his security detail? All because he \"Thought it was orcish\"? Who does he think he is, really?'\n\nThe line was already dead as Carthurg went onto another rant about orcish virtues, how what I had done was disrespectful to everything that orcs stood for. Now, seeing as the leaders who heard this were astonished and proud of my actions, one even bowing down in submission *immediately* after it was confirmed...\n\nBrom's face slowly morphed into an impressed smile. Carthurg was digging his own grave.\n\n---\n\n'Well, the only real difference between human and orcish music is the heavy emphasis on drums in orcish music,' I answered with a shrug of my shoulders. 'It's more a means of timekeeping in human music, to keep every musician on track.'\n\nThe other students were coming up with something to ask me, mostly something trivial. One young girl, a smirk on her face, raised her hand before the mike reached her. 'Have you ever heard of a chat show host called Carthurg Swift-Knife?'\n\n'I've been made aware of him,' I answered. 'Why?'\n\n'Well, a clip from his show hit the net recently,' she said as she looked at the holographic screen at her wrist, 'and I mainly watch him to find good snippets for comedic edits I post online but... I recognized your voice from this morning's show.'\n\nBrom, standing just off the stage, snorted and lost composure before quickly regaining it. 'Did you call him and make degrading comments about *yourself*?'\n\n'Well if I'm not going to known for being a true orc, I might as well become famous for being a cheeky bastard so why not?' I answered with a grin, the entire hall erupting into laughter.",

            "comment": "The young, precocious redheaded girl stared at the hologram that floated in front of her from the marble floor. \n\nThe video showed a man with a goofy smile and the fuzz of a beard growing on his face holding up his camera as he vlogged and pointed at his computer screen at an image of the night sky. The man in the video zoomed in on one particular star system, until a little fuzzy white star came into view. He threw an animation on top of it of text rolling by, as he talked about how it was his by law now. The text read \u201cThat\u2019s Mine Bitches.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat was your great, great, great, great, grandfather Gilberto,\u201d said Matthew, to his young daughter Emily. The man in the video threw some M &amp; M\u2019s in the air, that all clanked one after the other in his mouth. He posed in front of the camera with his hand on his chin as he chewed. \u201cA few centuries ago, he purchased this star.\u201d \n\nMatthew dropped the curtains of their mansion, and pointed at the sun in the sky above their capital city. A few older, beaten up flying cars passed through the view of the city in the sky, but the view was otherwise unobscured. They stared straight at the sun, as the windows had built in protections from UV radiation. \n\n\u201cI know the story,\u201d said Emily, rolling her eyes and looking at her father like she was worried something more was the matter. Matthew put a hand in the air like there was more, as he limped over to a hologram. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d \n\n\u201cLet me finish sweetheart,\u201d said Matthew, as he laughed some to himself. Emily was never one to care much about history. She simply enjoyed the life of an intergalactic princess. Matthew took a moment to cherish the memories he had watching his only daughter grow up, as he started to cry. \u201cI,\u201d Matthew bit his knuckle with his teeth as he composed himself. \u201cI was in the wrong star system at the wrong time this past weekend. I\u2019m healthy now, but I may not have much time and I have to go back to our ancestor\u2019s home star to get the treatments they\u2019ve held from the outer galaxies.\u201d \n\n\u201c*What?*\u201d asked Emily, wandering his way through the hologram of their ancestor as he took a rocket ship into space as an older man. His beard floated up a moment while they were in space, before he went into hyperdrive to his new home. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n\nMatthew did his best to not look his daughter in the eyes a moment, and distracted himself from his emotions by watching their ancestor set foot on his new home as an old man. He set a flag down while wearing a thin astronaut suit, as robots scattered from their spaceship to analyze the resources and begin building power plants, greenhouses, houses and more for the needs of the planet. Gilberto looked straight into the flying camera of a drone and smiled with all his teeth as he flipped off the camera with both hands. \n\n\u201cYou know Gilberto,\u201d said Matthew, smiling as he remembered all the hilarious videos he\u2019d watched of their ancestor. He forgot his pain for a moment. \u201cGilberto was a man of strange talents packaged into an odd exterior personality. He bought a star in his youth that became one of the more profitable little jump off points for life in the outer galaxies.\u201d \n\nEmily noticed something in her father\u2019s eyes. \n\n\u201cAre you bleeding?\u201d she said, with a horrified face as she walked through a hologram of their ancestor taking in the first breath of fresh air of their world. A whole chorus of other people followed behind, young and filled with life. They were only fetuses before they were raised on the planet. Emily studied the redness in the whites of his eyes. Matthew waved her off. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only burst blood vessels,\u201d said Matthew. He nodded in the direction of the hologram, as their ancestor held up papers and \u2018made them rain\u2019 as they used to say in front of a Skype call with politicians back on Earth who simply stared blankly at him with unamused faces. \u201cFor Gilberto, foresight was 20/20 really. At least that\u2019s the saying that\u2019s come and gone out of usage in our family to describe him.\u201d \n\n\u201cStop *talking* about Gilberto and TELL ME WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING,\u201d shouted Emily as a sensor on her dress tripped, and gave her a flashing red hologram\u2019s warning that her blood pressure was too high. A second later her vitals showed she was at risk of fainting. \n\n\u201cSettle down sweetheart,\u201d said Matthew, shaking his head like he needed her to not act like this. \u201cYou can\u2019t be that way, not if..\u201d Matthew looked at his guards in red, flowing suits approaching from the door, and gave them a look. They nodded, and left to give him more time. \u201cYou can\u2019t act that way if you\u2019re going to lead.\u201d \n\nEmily held still a moment, and suddenly became aware of her breathing. \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t mean it,\u201d she said, terrified and pointing at herself. \"Not me, you can't mean it. Dad?\" \n\n\u201cYou have the talents,\u201d said Matthew, nodding at Gilberto as he ran through blueprints of building up different town centers with their ancestral androids now on display in their museums. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to frighten you, you won\u2019t be involved with day to day decision making. But, all final say, for this brief period of time..\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019-,\u201d sniffled Emily, huddling into a ball on their plush, living couch that adjusted its feel to your mood. A few of her old stuffed animals on the shelf briefly exited their slumber, and stood up with concern to waddle over to their owner. Almost like if the Toys in Toy Story would stop pretending they weren\u2019t alive and tried to talk to Andy. \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d \n\nMatthew felt his chest a moment, before he dropped his hand. He didn\u2019t want to let it show. His silver suit glimmered in the sunlight, as he looked with pride at his daughter. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s law here, no other line can rule. Until I return, whether you want it or not,\u201d said Matthew, as the hologram displayed billions of stars, and zoomed out to display the galaxies of their empire. They revolved around Emily. \u201cThis world and the near galaxies are yours.\u201d \n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oscar_Relentos/comments/78jc70/scifi_emily_of_the_stars_part_2/)",

            "comment": "Carl watched as the being devoured the man that had been clipping his nails next to him on his flight. Instinctively, he wiped the specks of blood from his jacket. Pointless, he thought, and closed his eyes. At least it would be quick and painless. \n\nOpening his eyes after what felt like an eternity, he gasped. The tentacles had retracted, and the husk that was left resembled a giant brain. \n\n &gt;TESTING TESTING\n\nHuh? Where had that come from?\n\n&gt;DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?\n\nCarl nodded and gulped at the same time. \n\n&gt;ARE YOU CARL\n\nNodding again, he squinted in confusion. \n\n&gt;WELCOME HOME EXALTED ONE\n\nHome? Home was a cube the size of a refrigerator on Zormax 4. Here? He didn't really know where he was. He had accepted one of those \"you've won a free cruise to the Wastes\" mindchip calls, out of sheer desperation for a bit of a vacation. \n\n&gt;IS IT REALLY THE SIZE OF A REFRIGERATOR\n\nCarl nodded, his head seemingly stuck in a loop. \"Uh... yes? It's... quite nice though.\"\n\n&gt;WHERE DO YOU WORK? AN ENERGY STATION? HA. HA. HA.\n\nNormally, Carl would make a quip back. He dealt with enough shit from intergalactic truckers to take criticism for what he did, but this time was different. He wasn't sure whether or not he would be turned into a meat slushie like Gustav over there had.\n\n&gt;MEAT SLUSHIE? DO THEY SELL THOSE ON ZORMAX 4?\n\nShaking his head, Carl sighed. \"Who are you? How do you know my name?\"\n\n&gt;YOUR GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER, WITH A FEW HUNDRED MORE GREATS, PURCHASED THIS STAR EONS AGO. WE  MET HIM THEN, WHEN WE WERE LITTLE MORE THAN THE SIZE OF ER, WHAT YOU CALL FLEAS. OUR TRANSPORT SHIP HAD CRASHED AND AFTER THE ORDEAL WAS DONE, WE ASSUME HE DECIDED TO BUY THE STAR AS A REMINDER\n\n\"Er, my grand...father?\" \n\n&gt;YES. HE HAD TO PROTECT US FROM OVERZEALOUS MOVIE PRODUCERS. THEY THOUGHT WE WOULD BE THE NEXT E.T. BUT WE KNEW OUR IMAGE RIGHTS WOULD BE EXPLOITED. THANKFULLY YOUR GREAT GRANDFATHER SNUCK US INTO A STARSHIP WHICH WE COMMANDEERED HOME\n\n\"Are you serious? What does this have to do with me?\"\n\n&gt;WELL TECHNICALLY THE DEED IS STILL VALID. IT TOOK US A FEW MILLENIA TO FIND THE DESCENDANT WHO LEGALLY OWNED THIS PLACE. JANICE FROM THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT WAS MEANT TO DO IT A FEW THOUSAND YEARS AGO BUT SHE WENT ON MAT LEAVE. SO WHEN WE FOUND OUT YOU WERE TAKING THAT CRUISE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, WE FIGURED WE'D REACH OUT AND INTRODUCE OURSELVES\n\n\"And you want me to...\"\n\n&gt;WELL, ITS UP TO YOU. YOU'RE SORT OF THE BOSS AROUND HERE NOW. WE'VE GOT A NICE LITTLE SYSTEM GOING HERE. A FEW HUNDRED PLANETS CONQUERED, SOME BLOOD FARMS DOWN THE ROAD. LIFE'S GOOD \n\nCarl looked at the stain formerly known as Gustav, and grimaced.\n\"What about...\"\n\n&gt;HIM? OH HE WAS GOING TO KILL YOU OR EXTORT MONEY TO GET YOU HOME. YOU KNOW THOSE CRUISES ARE SCAMS RIGHT? \nANYWAY, LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND ",

Time to\u2014\n\nWhat The Fuck?!\n\n\"$12490004949902 CHEQUING ACCOUNT\"\n\nUmmm. \n\nUmmm.\n\nPaul waited a little whlie longer, then closed the browser, reopened it and reread his balance.  \n\n\"$12490004949902 CHEQUING ACCOUNT\"\n\nStill unconvinced this wasn't a hallucination or some wonderful, wonderful dream, Paul opened his chequing history. \n\n\"$832.21 DENNYS PAY  \n$12490004947902.01 C-15375 TRIBUTE\"\n\nTribute? Paul picked up his phone and dialed the bank.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Thomson! How are you today?\" answered a perky female.\n\n\"Ugh, fine? Is this a recording?\"\n\nShe laughed. \n\n\"No, no recording for you Mr. Thomson. We value our most valued customers. We know your time is more valuable than ours.\"\n\n\"Okay...\"\n\n\"How can I help you, sir?\"\n\nPaul searched for a way to start the conversation. What do you say when a number so large that you don't even know what it's called ends up in your bank account? When one week you wait an hour to complain about account fees and they next they treat you like royalty?\n\n\"My account...\" he began, \"my chequing.\"\n\n\"Yes! I see you had a complaint last week about account fees. Don't you worry anymore, we will no longer be charging your account. Your balance is well beyond the minimum requirement.\"\n\n\"Umm, thanks.\"\n\n\"You're most welcome, Mr. Thomson. Is there anything else I can help you with?\" \n\n\"Ummm. C-15375 TRIBUTE, do you know where that came from?\"\n\nHe heard the sputter of keyboard strokes. \n\n\"Ah, yes, this did puzzle the management, they even left a special note on your account. Would you like me to read it?\" the woman asked.\n\n\"Yes, please.\"\n\n\"Mr. Paul Thomson, account 1435533-2234, CHEQUING. As we have witnessed, an overwhelming sum of money has been deposited into this account. A full investigation has been put underway and uncovered the rights of the star, C-15375, purchased by Mr. Henry Thomson, 2017. Unknown at the time, the star is the focal of the Histarians, a race of human-like beings. Upon receiving a transmission of the purchase, the Histarians sent a large vessel, laced and filled with gold. Instructions informed the vessel and all contents be converted to the currency of the planet. If Mr. Thomson does not send back a confirmation of receiving the sum, war and annihilation are to follow. Despite our best ideas to cover-up and terminate Mr. Thomson, we have decided annihilation is not worth the risk. We understand this is a departure from the last 500 years, but the decision is final. For further questions, contact 555-555-5551.\"\n\n\"Wow...\" \n\n\"Quite amazing, Mr. Thomson. Would you like me to repeat it?\"\n\n\"No, that's fine,\" said Paul, \"just send me a copy.\"\n\n\"Of course. Is there anything else I can help you with, Mr. Thomson?\"\n\n\"Do you know how to purchase an intergalactic spaceship?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Thomson, let me help you with that.\"\n\n----\n\nEDIT: Got to work early and wrote out part 2 on my phone and accidently hit the \"X\" when trying to scroll up (My heart, tis shattered). It'll have to wait till tomorrow since I work all night. But the material is there so it will come! Thank you for the interest and comments. I appreciate them all! I'll put part 2 here but also on /r/ItsPronouncedGif to make it easier.\n\nUPDATE: Part 2 is up and down below. Also, it can be found here [Chapter 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItsPronouncedGif/comments/78o244/life_after_dennys_first_chapter_combined_with_wp/). I've combined it with Part 1 to create a first chapter. Thank you all again for the support so far. Work's pretty busy so I'm going to try to get to as many comments as I can, but if I don't get to you, rest assured, I have read it and appreciate hearing from you. You guys have some creative minds and it's awesome reading through your interpretations and ideas! ",

Which we have in our current system, except in the case of crypto currency there is no method to *print* more so-to-speak. \n\nThe only reason our USD 1-Dollar bill is worth 1 dollar is because the Federal Reserve says so. Crypto currency is valued by its utility and of course the way people view its value plays a role in the stability of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTo this date there is no known method to fool the system. It would be easier to steal a printer and the proper plates from the fed and start printing hundred dollar bills than hacking bitcoin would be. For security reasons alone cryptocurrency is superior to our current monetary system. An Equifax-level fuckup could never happen with cryptocurrency because all its users are anonymous and do not have an SSN linked to their digital wallets. (In case you somehow didnt hear about this, 1/3 of the US population had their credit info breached all of which is *directly* tied to your identity)\n\nThere is a lot of misunderstandings with cryptocurrency. The reality is its a secure, discreet way for people to buy and sell goods from one another without a middleman (i.E the gov't, banks, credit bureaus, walmart, etc.) Which is why EVERYONE and their mother who is involved with banking is scared shitless. Because if cryptocurrency were officially adopted they would all be out of jobs, even though it'd be a necessary evil in returning to a specie type currency to give people authority over their money and assets.\n\nTl;dr: cryptocurrency is misunderstood. Its not the future (maybe) but it gives financial power back to the people.",

                    "comment": "\nThe search began for a new spacecraft. First, they happened upon the BingCraft680 but it didn't quite compare to the GoogleDisk7000. Still, it didn\u2019t seem quite to par with the spaceship market. The VoyagerSee was nice and built for distance, but the luxuries weren't there. The StationNation was large and cozy, but slow as hell. Then there was the ApolloRocketofLove. It was perfect!.. except that every control resembled a sex toy. Finally, they found the perfect fit. No, not a sex toy fi\u2014nevermind. \n\n\u201cConfirming we decided on the ElonThrust 1677-X24L With heated seats?\u201d asked the woman who was helping Paul through this bamboozlement of choices. \n\n\u201cWithout!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, without! Because of the 'rump perspiration malfunction\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cMinor malfunction'!\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, yes, \u2018very minor\u2019, as you put it.\u201d\n\nThis woman had been wonderful to Paul. He had just realized he didn't know her name.\n\n\u201cSay\u2026 what is your name? I don't remember the last time someone was this nice to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cClyda.\u201d\n\n\u201cOhhhhh, Clyda, that's a\u2026 where's that name from?\u201d \n\n\u201cMars,\u201d said Clyda. \n\n\u201cOh, wow, Mars,\u201d said Paul. Only the exceptionally wealthy lived in Mars. This was actually the first person he ever talked to from there. Usually they wouldn't be bothered with 'Earthlings\u2019.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it's more of an Earth name,\u201d said Clyda. \u201cMy dad came up with it. He loved Clydesdale horses and if I was a boy, my name would be Clyde. But I'm not so he came up with Clyda.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting!\u201d said Paul. He didn't know what else to say. It was interesting, but saying 'interesting\u2019 to something interesting sounds like you're uninterested. He ended up saying nothing more.\n\nThere was a bit of a tapping from Clyda\u2019s keyboard.\n\n\u201cOkay, so the order has been sent. Congratulations Mr. Thomson, you are now the proud owner of a new intergalactic spaceship!\u201d\n\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, is there anything else I can help you with today?\u201d \n\nA sudden impulse struck Paul. It was like seeing himself on the other side of a soundproof window, pounding on the glass, trying to mouth something important. Paul stared and stared trying to figure out what he was trying to tell himself. It wasn't working.\n\n\u201cMr. Thomson?\u201d\n\nThe following sounds came out of Paul, in this order, \u201caiiii, eyela, ugh, wew, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn't catch that. Can you repeat it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWoood, is, can, you? Hoooow, how much do they pay you?\u201d he said, breaking out into a new suave voice.\n\n\u201cWhy do you ask, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just\u2026\u201d his voice cracked. \u201cUm\u2026 I just know, space is big, like really big and I was just kind of wondering\u2026\u201d At this point, Paul is dancing around his room like an elastic band being rolled across a flat surface. \u201c... Wondering if you'd maybe want to go. To space. With me?\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. One that felt longer than any moment Paul had ever lived. \n\n\u201cYou don't\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d said Clyda. \n\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll go with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nPaul jumped in the air. \u201cExcellent!\u201d\n\n\u201cSince I'll be accompanying you, I expect some kind of payment.\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh huh.\u201d\n\n\u201c2% of this 'tribute\u2019 you were given as compensation, either in a biweekly format over the entirety of the next year, or given as a lump sum before departure. Do you agree?\u201d\n\nPaul tried to do the math in his head but gave up. He didn't want to miss the chance at having some company on his journey and he was never great at math. \n\n\u201cSure, yeah! That's fair, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat! I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Thomson!\u201d \n\n\u201cSee you\u2014you know where I live?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, banks know everything about you. Which means I know everything about you. See you then!\u201d\n\n\u201cHa, yeah, see you then.\u201d \n\nThe call ended. Paul sunk into his sofa, thinking about all the things he would have to do to prepare for Clyda\u2019s arrive tomorrow. And his journey into outer space. And managing his new found wealth. And most of all, being owner of a galactic race. Oh, and quitting Denny's. All these things, yet they weren't enough to keep him from falling asleep. \n",

A number of executives began gambling workers wages on the stock market and gave a small commission to their workers. They were surprisingly successful and by 2065 the company was making 70% of its profit trading in stocks and shares so the decision was made to transition fully into finance and become a trading company.\n\nAfter the 2077 financial disaster Denny's decided to build a more secure base by getting into Banking, at first they catered only to other businesses, attracting custom with their low fees, high interest rates and talented and discrete accountants. \n\nBy 2100 Denny's had become a popular and successful high street bank \n\nBy 2150 it was the most powerful bank in USA and was making headway in the Chinese market. \n\nBy 2300 Denny's was the central banking infrastructure for the 3 largest world economies. \n\nBy 2350 Denny's had a strong enough hold over the worlds economies that they could successfully perform a hostile takeover of the world bank. \n\nBy 2400 Denny's had unified the the worlds currencies and began developing a whole new global financial infrastructure. \n\nBy 2500 Denny's pay was globally recognised as the simplest and most secure way to handle financial transactions of all kinds. Basically eliminating PayPal from the market. ",

            "comment": "\"You can\u2019t wear that,\" Inorai said, and her eyes narrowed in disapproval.\n\nI looked at my dress and wedges and then back at my assistant. She shook her head, her eyes now focusing on the digital clipboard. I\u2019d hired her as soon as I found out that\u2026 well, I was an *empress*. I let out a giggle. That word still sounded too funny.\n\n\"I\u2019m not doing it.\"\n\nShe looked up, her dark eyes as stern as the ginger hair knot on her head was tight. \"What do you mean? You have to.\"\n\n\"As the ruler of this galaxy, I have no obligations other than\u2013\"\n\n\"Okay listen, Blaire, you know that\u2019s not true. You have more obligations now than ever. You need to talk to your people. You need to establish trust. And nobody\u2019s going to trust an empress who dresses like a cheap Molarian.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re fired,\" I said, pouting.\n\n\"Right now, I\u2019m your best friend, and I have years of experience in...\"\n\nShe kept talking, but I zoned out and paced over to the balcony. Below, the evergreens shot up over the oily black solar panels of the city. The long ponds mirrored the pale blue sky before cascading down to the next level of Azure Dome. From up here, you couldn\u2019t even see the lowest levels of the capital, and the sewers where I\u2019d grown up. It was strange to me how well the suffering was hidden. One could probably live out their entire life here without ever even having to think about the scum.\n\n\"\u2026and besides, you\u2019re the one who has to lead now. It\u2019s not like you can just shrug off all the responsibilities. Are you even listening?\" Inorai threw up her hands in frustration.\n\n\"Fine, I\u2019ll do it,\" I said and dropped the dress that she had referred to as \u2018cheap,\u2019 even though it cost more than a year\u2019s salary on my previous job.\n\nShe gasped and politely covered her eyes to my sudden nudity. I imagined her to hold the same pose with her hand shielding her eyes when she was forced to visit parts of the city below level three. Disgusted, I started wriggling into the skintight outfit of polytryazic silver. It wasn\u2019t right that there were clothes more expensive than cities.\n\n\"You\u2019re actually going to?\" she said after a while.\n\n\"Yes, I told you.\"\n\n\"Right, great! I, uh, okay. A couple of things about manners and the way you carry yourself in public from now on\u2026\" she droned on.\n\nI sighed and started putting the strange ribbon crown into my hair. She\u2019d wanted me to hire professional fashionistas and makeup artists, but really, somewhere you had to draw the line. I took a look in the mirror. The crown looked like the ribbon on a present wrapping and doodled in strings of mercury down my black hair. I made an ugly grimace at my reflection who didn\u2019t seem very pleased at seeing me either.\n\n\"What\u2019s our closest galaxy?\" I said.\n\n\"That would be The Milky Way.\"\n\n\"Who lives there?\" \n\n\"You have to know that.\" She gave me a look of disapproval. \"That\u2019s where we once came from.\"\n\n\"Right, I was just kidding,\" I lied.\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \"Are you ready for the broadcast?\"\n\n\"Yes\u2026\"\n\nShe handed me the tablet, and it showed a hand imprint. I placed my palm on it and felt a sting on the tip of my index finger as it scanned my print and took my DNA key. A counter on the screen started ticking down. When it hit zero a tiny replica of me rose out of the screen, and a box with red neon letters said \u2018Live Broadcast.\u2019\n\n\"Greetings, citizens of Andromeda,\" I said, pulling my voice into a haughty tone. \"I am speaking to you for the first time as your Empress.\"\n\nI let my words hang in the air for a while for effect, just as I\u2019ve practiced.\n\n\"We are different people on different worlds with different religions and culture, but we share one thing. Every child no matter of social status has been taught that we, the Andromedians, are the greatest. We know this. It\u2019s in our bones and blood \u2013 in our souls.

            "comment": "\"Hey guys?\u201d Anthony said, fidgeting onboard an intergalactic spaceship. \u201cI\u2019m really not comfortable with this.\u201d\n\nThe tiny yellow creatures around him looked up, some with their one eye, others with two. Their brows furrowed and one of them pushed through the crowd.\n\n\u201cBut Anthony,\u201d Melrose, the leader of these creatures, with short stubby limbs and a single eye, said, \u201cyou have bought us. You own our stars, our land, and all that inhabit it. We exist to serve you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk, sure, but when I get off this ship, do I really need to walk down a staircase made of\u2026 whatever you guys are called? I meant, can\u2019t we just use a normal staircase?\u201d\n\n\u201cA normal staircase?\u201d Melrose chuckled and the rest of the yellow creatures laughed. \u201cOh benevolent master, how else will we *whatever you call us* know that we are merely dirt beneath your feet, to be stepped on and used as you see fit?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s also another issue,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cAlso, don\u2019t call me Master. I mean, I\u2019m black. My people have spent centuries getting away from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you prefer Our Owner? The Man who has Bought Us? The Wrathful God who we are Mere Toys to?\u201d\n\nFor a second, Anthony could only stare, his jaw slack. \u201cMaster is fine,\u201d he relented.\n\n\u201cNow, we must talk about your ceremonies. We have prepared virgins to sacrifice on your alter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWoah, woah, woah!\u201d Anthony waved his hands. \u201cNo, I do not want that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with virgins?\u201d Melrose asked.\n\nA hushed clamor sounded throughout the ship. \u201cAre you saying I can\u2019t be sacrificed anymore?\u201d a voice chimed in.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Anthony shouted. \u201cAnd virginity\u2019s not the problem! I just don\u2019t want sacrifices. Hell, I\u2019m a virgin!\u201d\n\nA round of gasps sounded. \u201cBut Master,\u201d Melrose said. \u201cYou are already of twenty-six earth year\u2019s age. Your most prominent years or reproduction are ending. It is time\u2019s like this when virgin sacrifices are most necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, no. First of all, I still have a few good years left. And secondly, I don\u2019t want your virgin sacrifices!\u201d\n\nA silence settled in the hull of the ship interrupted only by the creak of metal. Melrose sighed and spoke into the communicator he wore on his wrist. \u201cCancel the ceremony,\u201d he said. \u201cOur Master has demanded so.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we spent months preparing for it!\u201d a distressed voice said back. \u201cWe\u2019ve made promises. Written checks. Prepared virgins!\u201d\n\nMelrose turned, replying in a whisper but still loud enough for Anthony to hear. \u201cWell, what do you want me to do about it? Our lives are but playthings to our Master. He doesn\u2019t care how much effort we put into these things. We are dirt beneath his feet.\u201d\n\nAnthony put up a finger to protest. \u201cWell, hold on. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t get a single word in.\n\n\u201cIf he so willed it, he could take the stars from us and leave our people shivering until our hearts freeze over and our parents, our friends, and our children all die,\u201d Melrose said. \u201cWe are worth less than the insects he slaps away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true either.\u201d Anthony raised his finger and his voice, but to no avail. \n\n\u201cFor all of eternity, our crop will belong to him. Our children will be his. No fruit we bear, nor\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStop! Stop! Stop!\u201d Anthony stepped up to Melrose. \u201cWho the hell do you think I am? My grandfather bought me a star to name when he was drunk. I am *not* some God or some Owner or some Master. In fact, if I was, my first order of business would be to free you all. There, you don\u2019t have to call me Master anymore.\u201d\n\nHis voice echoed throughout the ship. Nobody else spoke. Then, the communicator cackled.\n\n\u201cDamn it, Melrose,\u201d the voice said. \u201cNot even our Master wants us!\u201d\n\nMelrose\u2019s single eye teared up.\n\nAnthony shook his head. \u201cWell\u2026 no, that\u2019s not what I said.\u201d\n\nBut his words didn\u2019t help. Tears burst out of Melrose\u2019s eye as he fell onto the floor wailing. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he cried in between heaving breaths. \u201cI just wanted to make you happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn it, Melrose! We entrusted this to you!\u201d the voice from the communicator shouted. \u201cYou incompetent bastard.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, Melrose, you're not incompetent. That\u2019s not at all what this is\u2026 look listen to me\u2026 it\u2019s not you, its\u2019 me.\u201d\n\nOne by one, the yellow creatures burst into tears, each collapsing onto the floor and wailing. Anthony looked around, his brow raised, mouth agape, and heart racing.\n\n\u201cOkay!\u201d he screamed, shutting everyone up. \u201cOkay! Okay! You guys aren\u2019t free. I won\u2019t set you free.\u201d\n\nMelrose picked himself up, wiping his eye. \u201cReally? And we can still call you Master?\u201d\n\nAnthony sighed. \u201cSure, you can call me whatever you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the staircase made of our backs? We can still do that?\u201d\n\nAnthony pursed his lips. \u201cSure, that too.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the virgins?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh God damn it!\u201d\n\n",

            "comment": "In 2017, my great great great great grandfather, Jameson Pearlson purchased a star, VY Canis Majoris, he was 12 at the time of purchase and was, in his time, considered to be a massive nerd who was obsessed with space. Thirty years later, when he was 42, he was designated as the leader of an exploratory/colony mission to the very star system that he had purchased, a decision that he had persisted on again and again until his superiors finally caved in. On May 14th, 2047, he left Earth, leaving his wife of twenty years and his 15 year old son behind. He maintained contact with mission command until he and his team initiated warp drive, from that point on communication ceased, and Pearlson was never heard from again. \n\nFast-forward 300 years and you have me, Jeremy Peets, a middle-class nobody working 40 hours a week for a robotics repair center in lower Miami, Florida. I had no family, only a handful of friends, most of which were slowly becoming to entrenched in their love-life to have time for me, and nobody looking forward to seeing me when I got home. Home was a mere 500 square foot box with a couple paper-thin walls making three small rooms for a bed and a bathroom, and the main room being the living room. Even working 40 hours a week I barely had enough money to pay for my living arrangements and food. I was tired of the monotony of it all and everyday I became just a little more depressed. \n\nOne day, as I approached the door to my small apartment on the 20th floor of a 200 story mega apartment building, I noticed that my door wasn't closed entirely. It was pushed up against the threshold, but wasn't quite latched. My first instinct was to back away and call building security, but the part of me that had just gotten off a double shift decided I didn't care that much and pushed the door open anyway. Inside, sitting on my sofa and flipping through the stations on my small plasma television set, were two people dressed in turquoise colored robes with a trio of golden horns set upon their head. Upon my entrance, they stood, turned off the television set, and bowed before me.\n\n\"Uhm..\" was all I could mutter, the strangeness of the situation was overwhelming. \n\nThe one on the left, the larger of the two, well built and with a head of curly brown hair, spoke first. \"Lord Peets, we beg pardon for our intrusion, but we come bearing news from the Pearlson Empire in the Canis Majoris Nebula.\" His voice was deep and demanded attention.\n\nI closed my eyes, put my hands up to my temples and rubbed. \"What.. How.. No.. I don't want what you're selling, just leave.\" I stammered, wanting nothing to do with this ridiculousness. \n\nThe one on the right spoke now, she was smaller, and her eyes were a burning purple color, the likes of which I had not seen outside of raves. \"Lord Peets, I don't think you understand. We are not here to sell you anything. We are here to give you the keys to a kingdom you could not even begin to imagine yet.\"\n\n\"Let me guess,\" I interrupted, \"All you need is my bank account information?\"\n\n\"No,\" spoke the male, \"We simply need you to listen.\" \n\nThe female continued where the male stopped, \"Three centuries ago, one of your ancestors left this world and flew to the stars where he created his own galactic empire that has grown, undisturbed by most outside forces. He passed his throne down through his blood-line, but alas his great great great grandson was impotent and birthed no heirs. You, Jeremy Peets, are the closest living heir to the Pearlson Empire, and we aare here to bring you to your rightful place, at the head of our empire. You will become a king among kings, experience riches beyond your wildest dreams, and have nearly unlimited power at your fingertips. You just need to come with us.\"\n\nI stood in the doorway of my small apartment, baffled by what I had just heard. I looked around, partly looking for a hidden camera, partly imagining my life drenched in gold and diamonds. I met the gaze of the two intruders, and against my normal, and often better, judgement I replied, \"Take me.\"\n\nEdit: Paragraph breaks",

            "comment": "I look out the viewport of the Arcadian spacecraft, at the shrinking blue ball I've lived on my whole life. Life on Earth sucked. A bout a hundred and fifty years ago, the global economy collapsed. Apparently, Germany was stuck bailing Greece out when Greece went broke. Then Britain left the EU, the United States ruined their own  economy which caused an economic collapse all over the world. Apparently, though, my great great great great grandfather, before all this, bought me a newly discovered star in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way. Our interstellar neighbors. Now, space is a big place, and that despite humanity's discoveries so far, there *is* other life out there. As evident from the reason why and the method by which I'm leaving the small blue planet. \n\n\"Your grace, we are underway, as you can see. Once we clear the solar system at sublight speed, we'll use our FTL drive to reach the seat of Arcadian power, The Apex,\" my liason, a slender Arcadian named Silea, informs me. Arcadia is the name we gave to the star, and when I was contacted by their representative, they liked the name. Due to my nationality being American, my language is English and because of my ownership of the star, the official language of the Arcadian Empire is also English. They learned my language by studying us from afar. The Arcadian people are humanoid, with skin ranging from pale grey to almost ivory, with a few outliers having skin colors closer to human tones. They only have three fingers on each hand, but I haven't seen their feet.  All of the Arcadian crew I've encountered so far have been wearing thick boots. Their eyes are normally purple or blue, and they don't have pupils like we do. Their eyes are colored black all around except the color in the middle, where a human iris and pupil would be. Their legs are jointed the same as ours, as are their arms. There aren't many physical differences, I'm not sure about the insides, but their true capabilities lie in their minds. Arcadian minds are much more capable than humans are: even the average Arcadian teenagers can understand complex quantum mechanics, and the inner workings of both their own biology, and that of other species. \n\n\n\"Thank you Silea,\" I reply, \"And you can just call me Alex.\" The Arcadians have empathy for everyone, and their senses are attuned to peoples' emotional states so that just by a touch or a close look, and any Arcadian can figure out how you're feeling. Unfortunately, such gifts bear a price. It isn't that they have an innate need for the blood of other creatures or something to keep them alive, but that their society and leadership have become very arrogant. The Arcadians are a civilization that stretches across four star systems, a fledgling empire with one goal in mind: to unite the galaxy against the threat of cosmic extinction. The one thing the Arcadians were able to figure out is that there's something bigger out there. And to truly get their job done, they needed a leader. The leader which, due to grandad's purchasing of a star for his son when he was a kid, is now me. Such knowledge came at a price, however, and that was getting themselves into a war with the inhabitants of the planet Eayn that the Arcadian...I mean, our forces couldn't win. Not without new leadership.\n\nWhich is why they got their new Emperor. Me. \n\n\"Of course your grace,\" Silea ignores my request due to a strict adherence to protocol. In the Arcadian military and government, respect is demanded of one's superiors, as I have come to learn from her. This type of rigidity is what got the Arcadians into their current mess in the first place. So, it's up to me to correct this behavior now. It's up to me to lead. \n\n\"I mean it. I don't want to be 'your grace' this or 'your eminence' that, or 'yes my Emperor' or 'no my Emperor' and crap like that.  I need to be able to talk to people without them being scared of me,\" I press my point, though secretly, I know why Silea is acting so stuffy. See, Arcadians are good at reading emotions, but when you grow up on the streets of Washington DC like I did, with parents who were killed in a car accident, you learn that there are people who will destroy you if given the chance, and you learn to spot them real easily. Which is why I can tell Silea's feelings from looking at her almost as well as she can tell mine just by looking at me. It's how I know she's got feelings for me, even though we met only two hours ago.\n\n\nAnd it's how she probably knows I've already got a crush on her too.",

He was sick of rain, all it ever did in this country was rain. \n\nAnd now it was coming through his ceiling.\n\nMichael reluctantly grabbed his jacket deciding he needed to go to the hardware store. He locked the door and turned around, he noticed that it was darker than usual, even in the rain. The sky had an almost sepia tone to it. Shrugging it off he started walking down the street, out of the corner of his eye he saw a sudden movement. Glancing over he saw a man in a full length raincoat. \n\n *Just some guy*\n\nSoon later he reached the store and set about gathering the supplies for his damned roof. Suddenly the lights dimmed. Michael swore for a split second he saw the rain soaked man. \n\nHe shock his head and turned to grab the screws off the shelf. Instead of finding screws he turned into a solid wall of wet rubber.\n\n*\"Drih dew jusb-pa, Michael hauej kuk\"*\n\nMichael looked up at the towering figure, had it always been this tall? Did it say his name? Feeling a thrill, Michael started to back away. \n\n*\"Drih dew!!\"* the towering figure boomed. The thing reached into it's 'jacket' and Michael turned to run in panic.\n\n\"Stop human,\" said the creature, \"you are Michael correct? Related to the human known as Paul Young?\"\n\nStunned and trying to comprehend what was happening, Michael tried to think. Paul Young? He vaguely remembered his father telling him about someone by that name. \n\nThen it clicked. Paul Young, his father's Great, Great grandfather. He died in 2018, it was said to be suicide but his children and decendants didn't beleive it. Not that it mattered to Michael, some long since dead man meant little to him. It *was* 2201 after all. No, Michael was safe in his own little bubble on this facsimile of ancient Earth. He didn't need anything, want for anything other than a choice to move to a less rain swept continent. At least the designers had got that right...\n\n\"You are Michael, yes?\" Asked the creature again, \"I apologise for scaring you, my autotranslate device hadn't downloaded enough from your information net to vocabularise my speech.\" \n\n\"Alright...\" \n\n\"You must be stunned by my magnificence.\"\n\n\"You could say something like that,\" Michael replied sarcastically.\n\n\"Or not,\" said the creature dryly, \"in any case I am in the simplest terms you can understand, an alien\"\n\n\"Simplest terms, yeah okay,\" Michael looked at the creature in pity. It was clearly a humourless creature. \"The Earth Confederacy, has been around for 150 years the concept of alien life isn't unknown to us.\"\n\n\"But this world is primitive?\" Argued the creature the only advanced technology is fission based energy.\"\n\n\"A copy, facsimile or whatever you want to call it, real earth died. Some of us live here to avoid the rest of humanity,\" Michael snapped back, \"what do you want alien?\"\n\nSensing an opportunity to get back to the point, the alien withdrew a small cylinder from inside it's schmock and handed it to Michael. \"This is from your Grandfather. It is the collective will and testament that you are now the sole inheritant to the title of EMPEROR and the ruler of the Prax Empire.\"\n\n\"You have got to be kidding me?\"\n\n\"What is kidding?\" The alien dipped his head listening to something, \"ah a joke at your expense. I assure you not.\"\n\n\"I don't want it.\"\n\n\"It is impossible, it is mandatory.\"\n\nMichael started to back off, he knew he believed this creature. But he was happy alone, with his colours, the rain, his *family*. He couldn't leave them. He needed to get home before things rotted. It was also mandatory. \n\nMichael sniggered to himself.\n\n\"What is your name alien?\" \n\n\"My name is long, so I shall be called whatever you deem it\"\n\nMichael pondered a moment, he needed something fitting. \"You are called Meat, creature\"\n\n\"By your will Emperor.\"\n\n\"I need to return home and gather my things, can you come with me?\" \n\nOf course, in fact if you will allow it I can transport us there instantly.\n\nWhy not Meat, what do we do?\n\nMeat clasped his shoulder. \"It is done\"\n\nMichael blinked, disoriented. Slowly he opened his eyes and sure enough he was home, he turned to the creature and saw that it had disrobed. It's long slender neck exposed. Michael grinned, as he reconsised it's weakness. He went into the kitchen as the alien started jabbering. \n\n\"Michael, your grandfather purchased our Empire long ago. He used the last of his savings to do so. He was our first human ruler. He was a great man. He sought to unite our species. Even bred with our females to bring genetic unity.\"\n\nMichael grinned, some more, hoping this annoyance to his life would continue. The colours were swirling in his mind. He could feel what was coming.\n\nMeat looked around, Michael had his back turned. His purpose was reaching a crescendo. Soon he would return home, at last. The alien peered though a crack in the door behind him. He could smell what was in there. Could smell it from the street. He knew what it meant. He also understood the undertones Michael had used before coming here. What Michael didn't realise was why he was here. \n\nMichael returned from the kitchen, but Meat had gone. Looking around Michael clasped onto the knife behind his back. His eyes darted as he sought his prey. He didn't hear a sound until Meat rematerialised behind him and promptly knocked him to the ground, imobilising him. \n\n\"Michael,\" said Meat, \"I lied to you. I have watched you for many years I have seen what you have done. I had hoped your grandfather was an isolated case amongst humanity. But I was wrong. You are vermin.  Your grandfather came to my world and killed, raped and poisoned our world. Because he thought he owned it. You are his heir. You have killed your family and you keep them in that room. I am a product of your grandfathers experiments. I am half human. I am vermin just like yourself.\"\n\nMichael couldn't move, his eyes watered, he tried blinking but it was impossible. His grandfather had lived and was apparently just like him. He thought of the cold embrace of his mother's boney arms, imagining her sweet scent in his nostrils. This alien vermin gesturing in front of him. He laughed to himself. So here it is.\n\nMeat looked at Michael in sympathy. This being the second human he had met, surely the rest of his species wasn't the same. But then again his homeworld was dead. Brought about by human hands or so his device told him. He concluded that humanity was a stain on the universe.\n\n\"Michael, you are now free of your obligation of Emperor, as will humanity be eradicated from the universe. I was sent here as a test of loyalty by my people. I was a subject of your grandfather. I will be glad to kill you, Brother...\"\n\n",

            "comment": "I was trying to book a hire craft for my family's trip to Napis Morai when the message appeared in my inbox. \n\n\u201cIMPORTANT: MR MARCUS RICHARDSON: You have been summoned to your local HUB! Immediate response required.\u201d \n\nI opened the message. \n\n\u201cPlease select from the following appointment slots to see your local HUB Administrator. YOU MUST RESPOND WITHIN 24 HOURS. Failure to do so will result in 0.3% debt added to your account and a further 0.15% for each subsequent 24 hour period of inactivity.\u201d \n\nI sank back into my chair as I browsed the available appointment times; the threat of a debt penalty triggering some instinctive reaction within me \u2013 a rebelliousness that I had inherited from my father. I could always respect authority but the threat of punishment always left a sour taste in my mouth. Still, I couldn't afford the debt. \n\nI had just resigned from my post as manager of the Lithium Exchange; my new job at the Cobalt Foundry paid less and did not start for another four weeks. For almost ten years I had worked for the Lithium Exchange. It had been fun at first, working with some interesting characters, progessing to the manager's position. But it was time for a change. The Cobalt Foundry was a lower salary but it had more paid holiday and better employee benefits. Besides, being in between jobs for a few weeks had given me the chance to take some time back for myself. I had the time to clean the solar panels on the house, take long afternoon baths and grow my beard out without having to keep it tidy for work.\n\nI had no plans for the next day so I selected the earliest available appointment. I did wonder why I needed to go to the HUB (or Human Union Base) but I could only assume they wanted to complete an exit survey for Lithium Exchange. Four other managers had quit in the last six months and I guessed the board were starting to worry.\n\nThe next morning I took the mag-tube to the HUB. It was in the central complex, around 30 miles from my habitation dome. Once I had signed in to the reception terminal I was escorted directly to the Administrator's office by an orderly. The Administrator was a silver-haired, middle-aged man, by the name of Rowlands. He shook my hand as I entered, \n\n\u201cMr Richardson, please take a seat,\u201d he gestured towards the chair in front of his desk. We both sat down. \u201cDo you know why you are here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven't a clue,\u201d I replied, \u201cand if I were to make a guess it woud be that you want me to complete an exit interview for Lithium Exchange?\u201d\n\nRowlands' little smile disappeared briefly as he pursed his lips. \u201cAh no,\u201d changing his tone from friendly to serious. \u201cAlthough, I am saddened to see Lithium Exchange lose more key personnel, I will not be conducting an exit survey today. I do hope they get their house in order, though, and review their employment package as we cannot risk closing down another commercial unit in this region.\u201d He stopped himself abruptly and looked as though he had already said too much. I knew that the local economy was struggling but it was a situation shared by many outposts across the system since the Lunar Crisis. \n\n\u201cWhat I do need to talk to you about, Mr Richardson, is something of greater importance,\u201d Rowlands produced a file from the desk in his drawer. \n\n\u201cEr, OK,\u201d I said, starting to wonder what this was all about. \n\n\u201cDon't worry, Mr Richardson, it is good news. Very good news for you and your family.\u201d He pulled a document from the file and handed it over to me. \u201cThis was given to me yesterday morning. It arrived from Sol Central,\u201d Rowlands paused and focused his gaze on me, \u201cfrom Earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarth?\u201d it had come as a shock, \u201cI have no business with Earth. My parents weren't born there. I am a fully fledged, second generation settler.\u201d I was worried. If it was a summons to Earth then I was going to have to cancel the family trip. Or accept a fine of more debt. Both of which I could not afford.\n\n\u201cMr Richardson, please,\u201d Rowlands said soothingly, trying to calm me before I got too hysterical, \u201cif you would just read the document.\u201d I opened the paper across my lap and began to read its contents:\n\n*\u201cTHIS IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR ADMINISTRATOR ROWLANDS OF REGION 210, PLANET 2, ALPHA CENTAURI SYSTEM.\n\nAdministrator Rowlands,\n\nPlease read carefully the attached documents and arrange an appointment with the relevant citizen. Once you have completed the handover of the inheritance, make sure you contact Sol Central Archiving Department within 72 hours. Failure to do so will result in 0.5% debt added to your account and a further 1% for each subsequent 24 hour period of inactivity.\n\nReginald F. Cummings, Lead Archivist, Sol Central Archiving Department.\u201d*\n\n\u201cInheritance?\u201d I said, looking up at Administrator Rowlands, \u201cwhat inheritance?\u201d My father was an agricultural engineer who had left me his debts when he passed five years ago, and my mother was now living with my sister in a region in the southern hemisphere. I knew very little of my family history and hadn't ever thought to look into it.\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about star registration, Mr Richardson?\u201d Rowlands stood up from his chair and walked over to his window, it overlooked the north side of the central complex. The sun was breaking through the orange clouds and the glow was causing his blinds to automatically operate. \n\n\u201cStar registration?\u201d I shook my head and pulled a face, \u201cI have never heard of it.\u201d\n\n{continued in reply}",

                    "comment": "Rowlands turned back towards me as his blinds completely shut and blocked his view. \u201cIn the early 21st century, before faster than light travel had been developed, visiting distant stars was just a fantasy. However, given man's nature of greed and society's systems of ownership and wealth, people were able to buy the rights to stars before anyone had even left Sol Central. Even before there was the Human Union, when Earth was still comprised of nation states.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, the 'rights' to stars?\u201d I interjected. I began to feel like I was being taken for a ride. I just wanted to get straight to the point \u2013 what was this inheritance? Hopefully, it wasn't more debt. I already had a debt score of 67% and I was hoping to at least reduce it to 20% before I died so my children could have more of a head start. More of a chance than I had been given anyway. My mother made no secret of the fact that my father had been reckless. He held a very reputable score of 17% when they were married, but, due to his drinking problems, he developed a lifestyle that racked up his debts to a very dangerous 92%. They were signed over to me once my mother was retired. Sins of the father indeed.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Rowlands continued, \u201cwhen the concept was first launched, it was a novelty. You could buy the naming rights to stars. You would have them named and you would get a certificate with the co-ordinates of your star. It was normally purchased as a gift for birthdays, weddings, anniversaries etc. For those interested in astrology and space, it was probably an exiciting prospect. To look up at the night sky, knowing that you owned a star. Perhaps they used home telescopes to try and locate them and maybe they thought one day, when man has reached out beyond his home planet, beyond the island of Earth, someone may visit their star. They were guaranteed the rights to not only naming the star, but owning it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how can you own a star?\u201d I asked. \u201cSurely all human settled systems are governed directly from Sol Central?\u201d \n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Rowlands had sat back down in his chair now, he grimaced and looked a little unsettled, \u201cbut since the Human Union became part of the Andromeda Empire, we must now adhere to the statutes and laws of the Imperial Governing Authority. This is where it gets slightly complicated, Mr Richardson.\u201d Rowlands attempted to make a sympathetic face, but I was beginning to lose my patience.\n\n\u201cPlease, Administrator, can you just cut to the chase? I am assuming that I now own a star out in the middle of who knows where?\u201d \n\n\u201cMr Richardson, your great, great, great, great grandfather, Eric Richardson, of San Francisco, California, of what was back then the United States of America, decided to, on October 25th 2017, purchase the naming rights to a star in the Pinwheel Galaxy. This fact was lost to us for many generations. A recent reclaimation dig around California was authorised and many early 21st Century artifacts were recovered. Among them was the central database for the star registry company that your ancestor used. Most of the stars on the database are within Human Union space and, as such, they cannot be legitimately passed on to the surviving descendants. Your four times great grandfather, however, decided to do something that no one else did. He chose to buy the naming rights to the star as far away from Earth as he could and called it Richardson Prime.\u201d Rowlands paused to take a drink from a glass of water, and allow me to respond.\n\n\u201cRichardson Prime?\u201d I snorted, \u201cthat is ridiculous. Who was my great, great, great, however many greats, grandfather? He sounds like a bit of a strange one.\u201d\n\nRowlands placed his glass on the desk. \u201cAlas, we have no information on Eric. We can only assume he was eccentric and interested in space, but with little imagination for naming a star.\u201d He smiled at his own quip.\n\nI had started to think about the details in my head. \u201cThe Pinwheel Galaxy, is that part of the Empire? Is it settled?\u201d I asked.\n\nRowlands cleared his throat. \u201cThe Pinwheel Galaxy is on the front line of an ongoing intergalactic dispute, Mr Richardson, between the Andromeda Empire and the Opha Praag.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Opha what?\u201d I had never heard this name. \n\n\u201cThe Opha Praag. They are a race of sentient, giant spiders, who are currently the main rivals to the Andromeda Empire. The Pinwheel Galaxy contains hundreds of systems that are home to planets abundant in precious minerals. Most of the Pinwheel Galaxy has been governed by the Opha Praag for centuries, but the Andromeda Empire has launched a military campaign to assert control over the region. Richardson Prime is in the heart of the galaxy, and is strategically placed well within Opha Praag territory.\u201d\n\nI had heard enough. \u201cRight well then I guess I can forget having anything to do with the star then.\u201d\n\nRowlands looked surprised. \u201cOh no, on the contrary, Mr Richardson. You are actually a very lucky man. You get the honour of setting out for Richardson Prime, claiming it in the name of the Andromeda Empire, and the Human Union of course, and hopefully bringing a swift end to the war by giving us the upper hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can forget it,\u201d I tired to close my jaw, which was repeatedly opening in horror, disgust and anger all at once at the suggestion that I was to head into deep space, into the front line of an intergalactic war with giant spiders. \u201cThere is no way I am leaving my home or my family, to get involved in any of this.\u201d I stood up as if to leave. But as I did so, metal manacles emerged from a hatch in the floor where I was sat and closed around my ankles, fixing me to the spot. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I was starting to panic.\n\n\u201cPlease sit down, Mr Richardson.\u201d Rowlands did not move an inch and remained calm, inflicting a slight authoritative tone in his voice. \u201cI am afraid that I am under strict Imperial orders. You will claim your inheritance, travel to Richardson Prime, and establish a colony. I have arranged for a military consort to pick you up tomorrow morning and take you to a warship stationed off planet. You will then embark on a mission to the Pinwheel Galaxy. You should be proud that you are able to serve the Human Union and Andromeda Empire and deliver to us a great victory.\u201d\n\nI struggled at the manacles around my feet. \u201cI don't want any part of this!\u201d An overwhelming sense of dread was coming over me, my heart was beating faster and sweat began to form on my forehead. \u201cPlease, why can't I just hand over the rights to Richardson Prime to the Andromeda Empire? Just let the military handle it!\u201d\n\nRowlands was activating his intercom, not paying attention to me, \u201cLook I am sorry, Mr Richardson, but it would seem Sol Central have a use for you. Plans have been made. To what end, I cannot say. After all, I am just a humble administrator. Plus, I have been assured that your debt score will be wiped to zero. In fact, you are more than likely to be rewarded with positive credit. Most people would not turn down an opportunity like that!\u201d He then pressed the button on his intercom and spoke into it with a stately tone, \u201cAssistant Administrator Falkes, I am going to sedate Mr Richardson now, please could you arrange for an extraction, thank you.\u201d \n\nThe word 'sedate' hung in the air like a bad smell. \n\n\u201cOf course sir,\u201d came the response from the speaker. \u201cI will send up the extraction team immediately.\u201d \n\nRowlands walked over to a cabinet by the window and  opened a drawer. A static field had been acitvated on the chair and I was unable to move any part of my body other than my eyes. I looked over to Rowlands and I could see he was preparing a syringe dart with a yellowy fluid. I switched my gaze to the window. The blinds were open again. The sun was shining brightly into the room and warmed my body as I felt its heat. The warmth comforted me a little, and I stopped straining my body all at once. As Rowlands began injecting me with the serum, as I started to lose conciousness and fall away into a deep state of nothing, my last thought was when was I going to see that sun again. That distant star. Home.",

            "comment": "The sun had reached its highest point in the sky. I stumbled out of the doorway from a bar and shouted, \n\"Why in the god damn did I listen to that idiot!\"\n\nI slowly regained my composure as I pulled out my smart phone and opened my banking app. \n\"Please don't be real, please don't be real, oh god please don'--\" I repeated as the app slowly loaded and I stopped as my balance showed on the screen.\n\n\"Ten Dollars?!\" I exclaimed.\n\"All I have left to my name is 10 Dollars?!\"\n\"How am I going to explain to the loan sharks that I spent all of my money buying some stupid star...\"\n\nAs I said that I pulled out and unfolded the deed from my jacket pocket.\n\"Deed to the Kaelthal Star, huh, well I guess I should stay away from the bottle for now... \nBut I wonder, where did that strange elf cosplayer go after she took my money\"\n\nKevin Ingol 10-24-2017 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter rummaging through one of my ancestor's Google Drive I had finally came across this.\nFinally, something to explain why a Kaelthalian appeared in front of my door today.\n\nWe had made contact with the Kaelthalians about 50-70 years ago but their region of space had always been a fractured mess constantly fighting each other. They were about as tall as an Average Human but still taller than me. The only real difference between Humans and Kaelthalians is that they have what I would call \"Elf\" ears and they don't take to kindly to being called elves either.\n\n\"Now you see my liege. There is no mistake in translation here, you are the owner and rightful King of Kaelthal by Intergalactic, Human, and Kaelthalian Law. The transaction is here in the Imperial records as follows. One Imperial Throne for five hundred thousand American Dollars. It is really quite the simple concept, I do not know why you had to dig through his royal highness, your progenitor's personal memoirs to determine this.\" \nFrilys said with a smug and triumphant complexion.\n\n\"What I don't really understand is why you guys were selling the whole throne along with the star, was it like some buy one get one free event? I mean clearly my great grandpappy Kevin was drunk and thought he was buying just the star. But not only this but how come I'm the person the Kaelthalian's named their king, er Emperor, and not my mom or dad?\" I asked Frilys\n\n\"Well your excellency, the star and the throne are one in the same, meaning the one who owns the star is the true ruler of the Kaelthalian Empire. However, we were not always an Empire. Originally, we were a republic, but it was determined that we would become a constitutional monarchy by the Congress of Kaelthal, and our Kings would be the ones to bring us out of our great economic depression and, so they sent envoys out to look for possible candidates. Which leads us to the sale of the Kaelthal Star to Kevin of House Ingol and thus the Ingol Dynasty was founded with Kevin I as Emperor of Kaelthal. This action, did not go as well as those congressmen had hoped. When the people had learned that they would be subservient to a mere human they took to the streets and the congress was dismantled by Gynth the conqueror and he assumed power as what you humans would deem dictator. Under his leadership we would conquer star after star to pave our way to remove this line of claimants to our throne. After Gynth's death our people fell into disarray and after 200 years of anarchy and civil war the Kaelthalian Empire was re-established with you my liege as its Emperor.\" Frilys replied in the tone of a kindergarten teacher scolding a child not to eat wood chips.\n\nI nodded to simulate my understanding of whatever the elf in front of me had just said. But I'm going to be completely honest here. I stopped listening after he said the star and throne are the same. His accent is thick enough to the point that I think it\u2019s along the lines of a retarded frenchman mocking a scotsman.\n\nBut to my own credit I tuned back in around the part where Frilys said the Empire was re-established. \n\n\"So, you Kaelthians just decided that I'm the new emperor because someone related to me from 200 years ago bought your star?\"\n\n\"Yes didn't I just finish explaining that?\" Frilys snorted back at me.\n\n\"Now then my liege our shuttle to the Imperial Capital, Kaelyndas leaves in...,\" He pauses to check his watch, but I don't recognize the characters, \"It leaves in about 6 hours so if you could please tell our staff what you want to do with your... current accommodations.\"\n\n\"Is there some sort of way you could just take the whole house and we could sort through it later or something?\" I lazily reply back only to wake up as I realize what he had just said.\n\n\"Yes I believe we could do that although-\" Frilys quickly responded but I cut him off before he finished.\n\n\"WAIT A SECOND! Did you say I had 6 hours to leave!?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is in fact what I have just stated how perceptive of you my liege. That is the official departure date we have set with your United Nations of Humanity in this district of Earth. Of course, we can leave as early as you desire.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not about leaving early! Isn't that a little bit too soon? I mean what if I don't get any internet at this ... erm Imperial Capital! I have very important things to do!\" \nSuch as watching next week's episode of Planetary Remodelers, but l'm not about to tell them it\u2019s about my holovision habits.\n\n\"If you\u2019re wondering about connection to the Intergalactic Web then we already have the fastest rates in the Palace that we could buy.\" Frylis said as he rolled his eyes as if knowing why I feigned being busy.\n\n\"Now if there are no more delays, if you would follow me we will board our shuttle and begin the journey to Kaelyndas.\" Frylis then began to walk towards the Los Angeles Intergalactic Hanger.\n\n\"Well I guess there is no real reason not to inspect my new holdings...\" I say aloud mostly to myself because it has dawned on me. I'm the Emperor or High King or whatever of the Kaelthians! All thanks to some guy that is vaguely related to me 200 years ago! Fate is smiling on me for once! I can live high and mighty in a palace surrounded by maids, butlers, and guards!\n\nOr so I thought.\n \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe grammar might be pretty bad and there is just a block of text\n\nBut it's my first WP so please tell me what to improve on!\n\n\n\n",

Apparently when my dad left me he baecame quite the successful Captian\"\n\n\"Intresting\" The Gristal said to me \"So you have a typical Rags to riches type story\" She interupted me, I hope she doesn't do that again. \n\n\"Yes, I like to think of it like that, I had a random ball of plasma and five or six floating rocks so What was I going to do with it, Declare it a sovereign nation and creating my own laws\" I wink to the camera. \n\n\"Well, what a nice story Thomas, What does the Galactic Union think about your little slice of paridise you have here?\"\n\nI smile, finally something I can tell the truth about \"Well they have been telling me all the benefits and positives of joining them, but half of the members don't even consider me an actual entity, but I filled out all the paper work. I am a nation by all accounts\" \n\n\"Intresting, We have a few interviews about diffrent members of the GU about your current status, is there anything you would like to say to them if you could?\" She used that word again, why does she keep doing that? \n\n\"I would just say, I'm a simple man and I just want to make money in these strange times.\" I smiled knowing full well that I just got on the subject of money. She might not notice it however. \n\n\"Speaking of money \" Crap \"You obviously are a very wealthy man Mr. Urban and I was wondering how you make that much money off of, you know a ball of plasma and 5 or 6 floating rocks\" SHe was using my words against me, obviously for a laugh from the audience but I still hated it. \n\n\"Well all my dealings are classified since they are state secrets but I can say that I am a simple evasion of trade taxes if you will\" That and I house at least 50 different wanted criminals in this sector. \"I make my own laws and people abide by those laws and that's all I do\" \n\n\"Interesting\" Again with that word \"Well I would love to ask you more questions about your little system here. Do you mind if we explore your home base here while I keep asking you questions?\"\n\n I chuckle a bit \"What are you hoping to find? No, they finished up an ocean just a few hundred miles south of us, we could check on that\" I press the button encased in my hand, almost invisible to the human eye. Hopefully Greg will understand what the signal means and will get everyone out of there. \n\n\"That sounds wonderful Thomas, We will be right back to you after this quick break from our sponsors\" I smile as the camera slowly pans back and millions of pounds of illegal cargo move to another discrete location.

At the top of the capital city of my capital country in my capital planet in my favorite galaxy, a place so dear to me even though I have been to countless places, I was watching my parade. Not in my homage, nor in my empire's homage, but a celebration for everyone. Today is, or was, a happy day, a celebration of our victory against, apparently, a much bigger army, a much more developed society. Today is the anniversery of our three galaxies union. And stll, unexpected things happen.\n\nI considered myself as a well prepared leader. Since I was a small a child they taught me about geography, astrology, physics, math, diplomacy, planetary cultures, the common language and many others. I aways liked to rule and to decide what is best in such a macro system. Some liked, some hated me, most didn't know about me, and there was comfort in that fact, safety against some of the dangers intrinsic to my position as leader. \n\nBut paramont beings knew plenty and fully about me. They couldn't agree with my family's heritage, claiming Earthlings rules of such ancient age were nonsensical, that their species lived aeons without human interference in peace. Which is bullshit, as any serious galatic historian could prove. Unfortunately facts are not aways taken in consideration and lesser things like anger and frustation clouds our sight.\n\nToday should be a happy one, even my personal guards were in a great mood, allowing most beings that crossed my path to the speech booth to salute me and wish a happy day. Today should be a happy one and so I was, but today while I gave my speech simultaneously to all of the 231 billion planets across our legacy I had my head swiftly and delicately removed from my shoulders by an invisible blade. I don't know how, and I didn't want to die, but I'm somewhat proud.",

The universe starts to shrink from my touch as time and space warp around the bee, still staring into my soul.\n\nI feel my face start to get sucked off me and swirl into the void of dissipating matter. The world is clearly and definitively putting its foot down, telling me, there is no opposite of a bee. A bee is just a bee. A living creature all its own. \n\nThe buzzing of its wings fills my head and begins to echo across the fading plane of existence. I touch my face and the buzzing gets louder and color bleeds from the world. There is no opposite of my face either, of the disfigured flesh that it's made of. \n\nI can't help but think this is an overreaction on realities side of things. If something had no opposite, or the opposite was debatable, the logical thing was for my touch to do nothing at all. Reality saw it differently though. And now there was a very judgmental bee staring at me as the world ends around us. As if to hit the last nail in the coffin of this terrible misadventure the bee stings me and starts to fly away.",

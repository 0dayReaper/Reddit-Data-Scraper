They almost always need at least a paper-thin pretense.\" It smiled, a small, smug thing that dripped self-satisfaction. Literally, by the laws of this metaphysical plane. Or possibly infraphysical, as it was certainly not one of the *higher* planes.\n\n\"Mmmm, dearsss, that'sss not true. Have you sssseen the namesss on their placesss of nakednesss? Csselebration indeed.\" The Cherish of Lust stretched itself out as it spoke, languid, repulsively obscene.\n\n\"Those aahhmmm do not count,\" the Cherish of Gluttony said, strands and crumbs of much less metaphorical substances than self-regard falling from its immense jowls. \"They are still ahhmmm subject to stigmas and certainly not yaahlmmm celebrated with a whole twelfth of the year.\"\n\nThe Cherish of Pride inclined its head. \"Thank you, sibling. You are correct, as all who agree with me generally are. This 'Month of Pride' they are celebrating is more a rejection of prejudicial shame than true Pride. Which is, in my august opinion, shameful in and of itself. Pride *should* be celebrated. Yes, there are prideful people at these events, my favored meal is omnipresent and strong nearly everywhere. It's why I am the best of us, the most well-fed. But it is not the true reason for them.\"\n\nThe Cherish of Envy shuddered and hissed. \"Still it is the name of *your* delicacy that is everywhere. You are already the best-fed among us, and I, I, I have to watch while you\u2014\"\n\n\"Ohhh do be quiet and spaaare me the effort of liiistening to your praaattle,\" said the Cherish of Sloth. \"The riiise of sooocial meedia has maaade you faaat and oooverfed.\"\n\n\"It is not a steady diet, like our *Sibling* the Consumer of Pride enjoys, not for *me*,\" the Cherish of Envy replied. \"They are starting to realize, many of them are setting it aside, they are not all feeding *meeeee.*\" Its words petered out in a thinning whine as it shuddered in self-pity.\n\n\"Envy me you *should,*\" said the Cherish of Pride, \"but not for this. Envy me because I am the greatest among you, and always will be. I feed on each and every one of them, even the ones who think they are the most sad and broken and without self-regard, because only Pride itself makes these things a burden to them. Only a very few ever approach true humility. As it should be.\"\n\nThe Cherish of Wrath slammed the semisolid ground with its clubbed, spike-studded forelimbs. \"SPARE US YOUR ARROGANCE, SIBLING. I HAVE NOT FED ON A WORLD WAR IN FAR TOO LONG. THIS IS YOUR FAULT. THEIR PRIDE IN SOIL AND BLOOD HAS WANED, NOT ENOUGH OF THEM WOULD SHED BLOOD FOR THESE NOBLE REASONS.\"\n\n\"Oh pleasssse,\" the Cherish of Lust said. \"You have the entire networked game-culture to feed on, jussst as I have...other networked delightsss. I know it isss not your favorite meal, not like real blood. It isss the sssame for me, I would prefer true orgiesss to recorded obssscenities, but thessse happen only ssso often where through their new networksss...it isss ssso abundant.\"\n\nThe Cherish of Wrath exhaled, a blast of iron and charged air. \"I SUPPOSE THIS RAGE IS VERY SWEET THOUGH LESS SUBSTANTIAL. I DO ALSO LOVE THEIR AUTOMOBILES. THOUGH THEY WISH TO AUTOMATE THESE. OH! THE MEALS I SHALL LOSE!\"\n\n\"Aaaahhh, yessss, sweeeet automaaation,\" the Cherish of Sloth slurred. \"Ooone daaaay sooon I shaaall beeee the beeest feeeed.\"\n\nThe Cherish of Greed cackled and rubbed together its seven hands in turn. \"They won't lie idle just because they have what they *need,* oh no no no, they will always want more, they will think they need it, more more more, and when true needs no longer need their effort they can turn sweat and striving toward more more more, never never enough.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" the Cherish of Pride said. \"The world is changing for all of you. It will wax and wane, but still,\" its smile spread to its entire metaphysical form, \"I will always be the greatest of us, no matter the new ways they learn to speak to each other, and regardless of what they might name their celebrations.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCome on by r/Magleby for more elaborate lies.",

I personally don't believe in any mythos, be that Ancient Greek, Viking, Aztec or Christian. That makes me an atheist. Whether or not one of the pantheon is the \"Creator\" is just a feature of the mythos. If I remember correctly the Greek mythos has no creator, just various entities that cover different aspects of what was then considered the world.",

Sure, she's the first being from chaos, but she didn't create humanity. She did create the Titans with Oranos, but the Titans created the gods, who then created humanity. It's more a focus of generational creation in Greek mythology. Each generation makes it own thing basically. \n\n(Keep in mind this is a very basic and a bit single minded explanation of creation according to the Greeks. For instance, some regions believed there were 4 races of humans, the first being developed by the Titans I think. Also I excluded the Giants who were made by Gaia and Tartarus to overthrow the gods. So kinda like a throwback Thursday but more like Give us back our time of glory that you stole from us, grandkids)",

It's interesting to me that she was always mixed between being a so called protagonist and antagonist - maybe a play on the Man vs Nature aspect of the way humans lived. I just assumed being the first entity from Chaos who then proceeded to make the grandfather race of humans would qualify. All though I thought there were Giants that Gaia made before the Titans. I know she created some to try and overthrow the Gods, but I had thought these were much smaller and weaker than (IIRC) her previous creations.",

If you think of the x axis being atheist and theist, you can use the y axis for gnostic and agnostic. An agnostic atheist is someone who doesn't know if there is a god or not but is not convinced that there is. A gnostic atheist believes that they know that there is no god. An agnostic theist believes a god exists but doesn't know for sure, and a gnostic theist believes in a god and also believes that they know for sure that god exists.\n\nAs an analogy, let's say that there is a jar filled with candy. A theist would declare that there is an even amount of candy in the jar. In this situation an atheist would say they are not convinced of that. Just because they are not convinced doesn't necessarily mean they think there is an odd number.\n\nSince the god proposition is unfalsifiable most atheists fall under the agnostic atheist camp",

The version of the god that I was raised to believe in was, according to my faith system, very strongly against...well, *several* of the things that I am.\n\nI was a truly devout follower, so the idea of shopping around for another religion seemed asinine; either what I believed in was true, or nothing was. You could say I already had the logical framework to dismiss other faiths out of hand, but not the one that I\u2019d been raised in from birth.\n\nWhen you are raised in a faith system, you are handed all of the tools for defending it, everything from \u201cGod works in mysterious ways\u201d to...well actually, that\u2019s the whole tool box isn\u2019t it; The presumption of existence is embedded in the defense.\n\nSo I was already primed to doubt because it was either drop my faith or hate myself, but what Gaiman did was tell me, in no uncertain terms, that every god which has ever been worshiped was, in their day, just as fervently believed in as I believe in mine.\n\nThis...kinda shook me, and I spent a lot of time thinking about it; How vain it was of me to think that I had it right, that of all the gods that had ever been *I had the right one*. The more I read about mythology, the more I realized how ridiculous it all is. Not just the other religions, but mine to. It\u2019s nothing but collections of stories of things that couldn\u2019t have happened, meant to teach you something about how to be a good person (or in the case of mine, how to be a bigoted, stone-age misogynist), that we\u2019re somehow still taking seriously thousands of years later.\n\nThat and the gay sex scene.\n\n\nMostly the gay sex scene.",

            "comment": "A knurled, ancient oak table sat in the center of a solid white room with no windows or doors; it was a little box of nowhere that the Seven Deadly Sins used to discuss important issues in times of dire need. The last time they gathered was to discuss whether or not Barack Obama was *actually* the Anti-Christ or not, because Envy was pretty paranoid that the big guys were making moves a little early. Thankfully, it turned out that he was just black. Fucking stupid humans and their false alarms.\n\nThe most recent time, however, the meeting had been called by. . . well, everyone--except for Pride. The other six had contacted her, saying a discussion needed to take place, and Pride warily accepted. She'd done well not to interfere with more than a hundred human lives that year, and had been regularly watching YouTube videos on how to live a humble life. Admittedly, she thought she was better than the guy giving the lectures and quit watching, but it's the thought that counts. \n\nGluttony, Lust, Wrath, Envy and Greed sat at the table, hands folded, quiet eyes avoiding Pride, whose gaze danced around the room, looking for someone to give her an indication of what was going on. She was feeling an itch of anxiety in the back of her mind, the seed of worry sprouting; had they finally decided to try and take her out? After all, she was *clearly* the strongest and most important Sin. Obviously.\n\n\"So,\" Pride said, clearing her throat, tapping the table. \"Can we just get started already? Seriously, I get the whole 'all or nothing' rule, but she's taking even longer than usual, and it's not like he has anything to offer in these meetings.\"\n\n\"**Shut the fuck up**,\" a deep, dark voice, like the crack of ash-colored thunderstorm clouds, crashed over them. \"**I hate you, Pride, you maggot. But I also agree we should stop waiting for that goddamn, slow-as-fuck sack of shit. I don't have any fucking patience left for this. Let's just kill the bitch.**\"\n\nPride sighed, wagging a finger. \"Now, now, Wrath. Let's remember our table manners. Besides, I wouldn't want you to get hurt fighting the strongest Sin just because you're blind.\"\n\n\"**Fuck you and your entire family. I'm going to rip your skull out and fuck it right here, on the table.**\"\n\nLust perked up, a smile slithering across his face, and Pride groaned. \"God, Lust, have some self-respect. And Wrath--I *am* your family, you idiot. Why are all of the Sins so stupid? Honestly.\"\n\n\"Calm down, Wrath,\" Greed said, his voice like two pennies rubbing together. \"Save it for when we make a decision, then you can murder her and whatever else you two freaks have planned. I don't care, but we're going to make sure we get what she has first.\"\n\nPride rolled her eyes. \"Look, guys, I know I'm the greatest of the sins, but you can't take that from me. Even if you pool together and kill me, you'll still all be every bit as inferior as you are now.\"\n\nEnvy smashed her hands on the table, standing up. \"Quit lying, you bitch! We know you've been working behind our backs, interfering with the human world! We want what you have!\" \n\nPride knitted her brows. \"Wait, what? What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Don't play stupid,\" Greed said. \"We know they're throwing a celebration for you right now. It's literally called the 'Pride Parade', and they all get real dressed up in bright colors, making themselves the center of attention, which is your favorite thing in the world to do. So don't even try and pretend this isn't your work. We want a cut of what's going on here. How are you so involved without completely spiraling the world's balance off and. . . you know, pissing Dad off?\"\n\n\"I literally have no idea what you're talking about. But, honestly, this just proves my point. I haven't done any interference, and I didn't do anything to set that up. They just know I'm the best and they're celebrating me, what can I say? Get good, you fucking losers.\"\n\nA portal of light fizzled and popped, and a ragged woman fell from it, splatting against the floor like a sack of potatoes.\n\n\"Ah, how great of you to finally join us,\" Greed said. \"Now, be a dear and make it to the table before we adjourn, if you can.\"\n\n\"**You dumb bitch. You're ten feet away from us. Just get the fuck up and sit at the fucking table you useless god-turd. Mom must've shit you out on accident.**\"\n\nSloth yawned, her hand moving at a snail's pace, and the group sighed.\n\nGluttony finally looked up from his meal, face covered in bits of food and gruel, looking like the disgusting animal he was. \"I want a parade with FOOD, FOOD, SO MUCH FOOD, EVERYBODY EAT AND NEVER STOP EATING AND--\"\n\n\"**You fat piece of shit, don't get started with that or I'm going to drown you in your fucking cereal.**\"\n\nThe giant went back to his food, nearly drowning himself in it instead, and pride groaned. She'd always found Gluttony to be repulsive.\n\n\"Just tell us, you bitch,\" Envy said, crying, arms crossed. \"Just fucking tell us! It's not hard! Stop being a meanie, I WANT IT!\"\n\nPride rubbed her temples--family gatherings are always such a fucking mess. \"Seriously, guys, I didn't do this myself. If they want to celebrate me because I'm awesome, I can't control it. Stop blaming me and blame yourselves for not being worth it.\"\n\n\"**I'll fucking paint these walls with you if you don't quit flapping that mouth, and then we'll see who's the best Sin.**\"\n\nGreed opened a little viewport in the center of the table for everyone to look into. As they peered in, they watched the crowd of bright colors and rainbow flags, of men and women defying the norm their father had set in order to do whatever their hearts desired. Men embracing men, women kissing other women, all wearing smiles and standing tall in front of the rest of the world.\n\n\"You guys think this is a parade *I* set up?\" Pride asked, face contorting.\n\n\"**Why are the boys kissing? Oh. . . oh no. I don't want it anymore.**\"\n\nLust giggled, leaning over to him, and he fled from a hand wandering his way. \"What's the matter, you big, scary man? All that talk and a little fun sends you running? Look at them. . . yes, I need this. I want to be there. Take me there right now, Pride.\"\n\nBut Pride was confused, staring into the viewport. It was clearly not about her, because if anything, it had the look and feel of something Lust would create for fun. She kept watching them, standing tall before the scorning eyes, disobeying the rules humans before them had tried to set, letting their true selves show without an ounce of shame for it. They were strong, and true, and. . . \n\nProud. \n\nShe smiled as she looked into the porthole--ignoring Wrath's screams, Sloth's yawning corpse inching closer, and Lust starting to make some uncomfortable motions with his hands--and felt pride, just once, for something other than herself.\n\n---\n\n*/r/resonatingfury*",

            "comment": "Fyi I flipped the prompt on its head because I thought it was a better fit for my version. Hope people still enjoy my quick attempt at a comedic take on this theme!\n___\nI strode into the impromptu gathering of the Seven Deadly Sins with confidence. Well, not to put too fine a point on it, but I strode in with a fair amount of pride if I\u2019m being honest. Being the Aspect of Pride, I was of course quite familiar with the feeling, but I was positively overflowing with myself at the moment. This emergency meeting had been called purely because of me!\n\nWell, at least purely because of how humans were choosing to use my name. \u2018Pride Month\u2019 had become all the rage in human society and my fellow aspects of sin were alarmed to see me being celebrated and exalted in such a way. Of course, I knew that the month actually celebrated LGBTQ individuals and the progress that had been made toward sexual and gender equality, but I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to tell them that! I *loved* that they thought I was suddenly being elevated above the rest of them! My lone goal for this gathering was to prevent them from discovering the truth.\n\nOur meeting place wasn\u2019t a fixed location or even \u2018real\u2019. We tended to exist outside the bonds of space and time, so technically any of us could create whatever location we desired. Why we agreed on a boring and drab conference room I have no idea, but getting all seven of us to agree on anything was quite a chore so we tended to stick with this incredibly lame motif.\n\nMost of my fellow aspects of deadly sin glared at me as I entered. I greeted them each condescendingly as I surveyed the room. Some other aspects of newer or lesser sins sat around the edges of the table, taking notes or refilling coffee. They were the 'interns' of our little organization, working hard in relative obscurity, hoping for a call up to the \u2018grown ups\u2019 table some day. My actual associates, Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, and Envy were already seated around the conference table as I took my place among them.\n\n\u201cThis meeting is called to order,\u201d Sloth yawned from the rotating chairman's seat. \u201cWe are here to discuss the unprecedented development of one of our members being outright celebrated by humanity and the potential ramifications on our ability to fulfill our roles. The floor is now open for debate.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, Envy was the first to speak up, \u201cPride, my old friend and valued colleague, you know that I am a fan of yours. Truly I am! I feel we often go hand in hand and have done great work leading humans astray together in the past. But do we *reallly* need an entire month celebrating you? I mean, what have youuuu doneeee that I haven\u2019t done? DO YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE BETTER THAN ME?\u201d\n\n\u201cEnvy please, you know I can\u2019t change the way human\u2019s feel, it's explicitly against our rules and bylaws! If they feel naturally inspired in the depths of their souls to celebrate my greatness, who am I to say no?\u201d I asked with some degree of feigned smugness.\n\n\u201cThis is such a waste of time,\u201d Lust chimed in. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we put all this energy into something more fun? We could transform this room into a seedy hotel and just see where events take us.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the last time, Lust, we are not turning our annual meeting into an orgy,\u201d Sloth said. \u201cYour proposal has been voted down countless times in the past, and the sole focus of this discussion is Pride\u2019s month.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not jealous of Pride\u2019s month at all!\u201d a voice piped up from the background.\n\n\u201cYeah, it's nothing special! I heard that Pride bribed millions of humans just to get his stupid month!\u201d another spouted.\n\n\u201cLying, Gossip, please remember that you are not yet official members of this organization. Per our bylaws, please remain silent unless spoken to,\u201d Sloth lazily chastised them.\n\n\u201cGahhhhhhh! Enough of this nonsense!\u201d Wrath shouted as he stood and violently flipped the table. \u201cThis is BULLSHIT! I am the greatest of all the sins. It is I who have been the downfall of greatest generals and leaders throughout history. If any sin should be celebrated it should be me and me alone!\u201d\n\nWrath ranted and raged for hours on end. Normally we just let him go until he exhausted himself, but this was getting absurd. I finally decided to interject. \u201cWrath, my old frenemy, why does my month of celebration bother you so much? What\u2019s *really* going on?\u201d\n\nWithout warning the shape and form of our ethereal conference room shifted to resemble a psychologist\u2019s office. Most of the aspects of sins sighed or grumbled as they stood around the edge of the room, but I was seated on the chair and sure enough Wrath settled in on the therapy couch before he began to speak. \u201cWell, my anger probably comes from a place of insecurity, I know that. I\u2019m not really one of the \u2018fun\u2019 sins. People just loooove to eat themselves to death, or chase enormous wealth, or get freaky with some new hot guy or gal every night of the week,\u201d he said while glancing sheepishly at Gluttony, Greed and Lust as he described the behavior they were responsible for. \u201cBut me? Humans don't *want* me... I\u2019m most often a very undesired arrival or even a side product of the other hip and cool sins. I tend to pop up when they least expect me\u2026. I\u2019m just... I'm ugly, I\u2019m so damn ugly inside and out!\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm, mhmm\u2026 mhmm\u2026 I see,\u201d I muttered. \u201cSo lets really dig into these feelings you\u2019ve been having. Just taking a shot in the dark here, but\u2026 how was your relationship with your parents?\u201d\n\nWrath burst into tears.\n\n*Bingo*, I thought to myself with... once again... not a small amount of pride. If I\u2019d learned anything from watching human entertainment, it was *always* the parents at the root of things. This wasn't even going to be a challenge.\n___\nCheck out r/Ryter if you want to explore more stories that probably violate the Seven Deadly Sins in some way or another.",

            "comment": "\"Go on, look. See, I told you, a whole month, all for me. And furthermore, have you seen the parades they hold for me?\" Pride beamed at his 'followers' as he looked over them from his penthouse suite. He was staying there to observe his month of focus, a truly remarkable act from these humans. With him were the other 6 of the 7 deadly sins, and each of them was mulling this over in their own way. \n\n\"This is fucking BULLSHIT. I have done NOTHING but influence every single FUCKING human for, oh I don't know, eternity, and all I get is, oh look: FUCKING NOTHING AT ALL.\" Wrath fumed as he looked down at the people on the street. \"They look way to fucking happy for it to be pride, they must be feeling something else...almost looks like...no yeah...they do look proud. FUCK.\"\n\n\"All I know is that they are showing enough skin, they may as well be celebrating Lust month.\" Lust stood looking out the window. She had stopped loquaciously describing lavish lewd thoughts to exclaim this small truth. \"Honestly, its like I'm there reveling in the debauchery.\" \n\n\"No, no, look in their eyes. They are truly proud, albeit a bit under dressed, and showing their deep understanding of what that means! And look, I mean just look at their confidence! Normally when I choose a color, I try to be a little modest, only choosing what obviously looks best on me: Reds, blues, summer and winter colors, etc... But they, bless their souls, they decided that what better way to be proud than to just take all the colors!\" Pride was beaming as he looked over the parade. \n\n\"Yes...I've been thinking about that. Taking everything from others...happiness, after all they've been called the 'Gays', surely that means they are taking all the happiness for themselves. And all the colors, they are clearly gluttons who simply don't know what to call themselves. They may have pride, sure, but obviously they are just taking everything they want for themselves. Clearly gluttony.\" The fat sin sat back and watched as the parade continued.\n\n\"Gluttony, look at them. They are fit as all get out, dancing constantly, and making sure they all look fit and fine as ever! How can one be gluttonous if they won't even eat Gluten?\" Pride retorted, grinning from ear to ear. \"Obviously they enjoy themselves, and they simply take what they want because it is their right as proud people.\" \n\n\u201cWhy...can't....people...just...ride....the.....cars...?...Why....must...they.....dance...and...run...?...Even...watching...them....is...exhausting..........\u201d Sloth slurred as he slowly spoke. \u201c...surely....we.....can.....help....them......slow....down....?\u201d\n\n\u201cPride hides from no one! And runs wherever they choose!\u201d Pride looked over Sloth. \u201cI suppose you could never even fathom something as wonderful as being proud. You barely even move.\u201d Sloth simply shrugged at the remark, choosing not to speak and instead remained silent. \n\n\u201cIf anyone deserved a parade it was me! I'm the one who inspired this whole thing anyway. I mean, these people are showing who they love, and its obvious that having a parade meant they were just envious of those people who were able to flaunt their relationships in public. And what do you mean Pride month is about you, Pride? This has damn near nothing to do with you! They are just being themselves and being happy after fulfilling their envious desires of equality! And you seek to take this from me? How did you even get your name on this ticket? Unreal!\u201d Envy was turning a great shade of scarlet as he looked over the crowded streets. \u201cIt doesn't make any sense!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, now, Envy, surely you know that just because you inspired something doesn't make it any more yours than it would Pride, and he is always one to take credit.\u201d Greed checked his watch as he spoke, making sure the time was right. \u201cIf anyone deserves a month its me. After all, I make the world go round. Money, status, everything needed to make sure elections go the right way, the right people end up in charge, and the rich can keep getting richer. Though, I suppose I don't need a month when my way of life is THE way of life on Earth.\u201d Greed chuckled, \u201cI'll let you have this one thing, Pride, its all you'll ever get from me though.\u201d \n\nPride looked downtrodden, but only for a moment. \u201cI would be sad, if I didn't have a thousand people walking in the street calling my name! Ha! Pride month, they should have thought of this a lot sooner really.\u201d",

            "comment": "Greed was at the register as Gluttony put the finishing garnishes on a fresh batch of Creme Brule's in the cozy bookstore cafe they owned together in San Francisco. They didn\u2019t normally work here of course, they were partners and share owners in a number of business ventures. However they had given their staff the day off and thrown a closed sign over the window. The only customers coming in today would be their siblings.\n\nSloth was the first to arrive, as was normal these days. In the past he had often been late or missed the family gatherings. That was until the siblings had decided enough was enough and sent Wrath to talk to him. After that, Sloth began showing up several hours early with a book to read.\n\nEnvy was the next to show up. The cafe door opened with a breeze as she nervously shuffled in, eyes cast downwards.\n\n\u201cH-hello\u201d she mumbled, bringing out her phone and pretending to check it without ever turning it on.\n\n\u201cHey Sis!\u201d The twins Greed and Gluttony called out cheerfully, while Sloth continued to read.\n\n\u201cHave a Creme Brule\u201d said Gluttony.\n\n\u201cAnd a coffee, of course\u201d cooed Greed.\n\nEnvy lips rose a little at the welcome and she noded in response to the questions. Her eyes rose and for a brief instant she flicked them towards her siblings but then quickly averted them as if she accidentally looked at the sun.\n\nAs Envy sat down beside Sloth, the door opened again as a boy of about seven entered. He had curly brown locks and held a red balloon with huge goofy grin on his face.\n\n\u201cHello Wrath!\u201d Called out the twins, while Sloth turned another page. Envy started to look up, but then visibly froze and focused hard on her phone.\n\nWrath smiled sweetly at his two brothers, and then shot a sour expression at Envy who flinched while typing.\n\n\u201cCan I have some cheesecake?\u201d Wrath asked.\n\nGreed and Glutton shot each other a glance.\n\n\u201cHow about... a fresh Creme Brule?\u201d said Gluttony.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want what *she\u2019s* having\u201d said Wrath turning to face Envy and her dessert with a hint of a sneer crossing his face. Envy seemed to shrink in her chair a little, and started typing furiously on her phone. Wrath turned back to his siblings and spoke slowly \u201cI said... I wanted... a slice of CHEESE CAKE.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, well. We don\u2019t have cheese cake here,\u201d said Gluttony. \u201cBut I\u2019ll get you a slice later. How about a vegan cupcake?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send you a full cheesecake tomorrow!\u201d Greed chimed in.\n\n\u201cUseless fuckers,\u201d Wrath spat out in his squeaky voice as he stomped over to where Envy was sitting. A display table was in the way and instead of walking around it Wrath raised both his hands and shoved with his entire body. Envy jumped in her chair as the table hit the ground with a tile-shattering clatter and the patter of books.",

That is *my* day! *My* month! You've taken Black Friday and started pushing it into Thursday!\"\n\nGreed chuckled, \"Yep, and that is making a ----ton of money.\"\n\n\"You gotta admit,\" Lust purred, \"It's pretty impressive the way you drive the mortals into a frenzy like that.\"\n\n\"I AM TALKING, HERE!\"\n\nEveryone turned to look at Pride. \n\nPride composed themselves, and puffed out their chest. \"As much as I would *love* to have an entire month dedicated to myself, I can't actually take credit for that.\"\n\nLust laughed, and looked at Pride through half-drooped eyelids, \"Oh, I love it when you delude yourself.\"\n\n\"Quiet. If anything, this month is more your department.\"\n\n\"Oh please,\" Lust said, lounging back, \"there's a difference between love and lust.\"\n\n\"Precisely my point!\" Pride grinned, tothe puzzlement of the others. \"When you take love to the sinful extremes, you get lust. Similarly, there's a difference between Earned Pride and,\" they gave a knowing grin, \"Unearned Pride.\"\n\n\"What's the difference?\"\n\n\"Glad you asked, Sloth! Earned Pride is what happens when you are Prideful of what you have accomplished. Unearned Pride is when you are Prideful of what you *are*.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence. \n\n\"You know,\" Lust purred, \"you're not helping your case.\" \n\n\"Wait-\"\n\nEnvy pushed in, raising his voice. \"I told you!

We want months too, and you can sit your pompous ass down and let *us* shine during *our* months!\"\n\n\"Now see here...!\"\n\nWrath huffed at Greed while the others continued to argue. \"As much as I *hate* that you're taking up more of the mortals time, at least you're not a lazy ---- like Sloth!\"\n\nSloth didn't even dignify that with a response.",

They all sat together in a corner of the place, a booth with a circular couch and table.\n\n\"Hey, Lust, how're the kids doing?\" Greed leaned in and dug into a burger, juice dripping from his fingers.\n\nLust fingered the air and made a face; Greed's eyes grew and he spat out a half-chewed beef patty. \"Sweet second coming! Marissa didn't say nothing?\"\n\n\"He,\" Lust corrected. Gluttony reached over, grabbed Greed's half-chewed meat, and crammed it in his mouth, wiping his fingers on the napkin.\n\n\"What about you, Glut?\" Greed asked.\n\n\"Oh, I...\" Glut shifted in his seat and leaned back, letting his gut sit on the edge of the table. \"...I got kicked out of an all-you-can-eat by eating too much.\"\n\n\"There are all-you-can-eats?\" Envy asked, picking out the last fry from the shared plate in the middle.\n\n\"Yeah, it was sooo good.

At least I keep dignity.\"\n\nIt was discussion enough for Wrath to put down his glass. \"Fuck you! You're not the only deadly sin. There are six others. Make more than half the year our thing.\"\n\n\"It's not even my thing! Are you even listening?\"\n\n\"I should get two months. I can pay you guys to do it.\" Greed slid two coins and a piece of the temple veil with a tear down the middle. \"Eh?\"\n\nEnvy snatched the veil and then stuffed it in Wrath's water. \"That's not the real veil, and if you get two months I get two months.\"\n\n\"You're untrustable,\" Pride pointed at Greed, \"You're just riding Greed's argument,\" he pointed at Envy, \"And if anybody deserves to get two months, it's Glut or Wrath. Just the other day, I saw a guy get into a revenge threesome because he found out his bi girlfriend was cheating on him. You couldn't do that even if you tried.\"\n\n\"I kind of took down Wells Fargo,\" Greed objected. Envy shrugged, not having anything to say.\n\n\"Also, Gluttony is hilarious and I can't stop reading 'Florida Man' headlines.\"\n\n\"So, what's your solution?\" Greed leaned in.\n\n\"Okay.\" Pride took out a pen and opened a napkin.\n\n\"January is Sloth month, so that everybody gets screwed off of their New Years resolutions. February is Lust's, because Valentines Day, y'know?\n\n\"Give March to Gluttony *and* Greed, double trouble, so that he can lead up to St. Pat's and get everybody *wasted* to hell, and April will go to Wrath, because Aries takes up most of the month there.\n\n\"Skip May, June, and July, but give August to Envy so that if there are summer flings, they get destroyed by jealousy. Systematic destruction of God's children. Finally, I'll get December.\"\n\n\"Fucking kidding me.\" Greed spat under his breath. \"You give yourself two months?? What?\"\n\n\"No, December because Christmas is about being humble, and I would absolutely fuck that. Reasonable?\"\n\n\"What's reasonable is that you cut out your other Pride month.\"\n\n\"That's not *my* Pride month, you-\"\n\n\"That's what you want us to believe!\" Wrath stood up, kicking a chair backwards into a wall and shattering it.\n\nPride covered his face with his hands. \"Shit, this is gonna be a long lunch. Hey, where was Sloth again?\"",

I\u2019m not celebrated with a parade and people waving flags around.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d I groaned at him. \u201cAs if you aren\u2019t celebrated. Have you walked by an ice cream parlour lately? Have you heard of a little something called the Cronut?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t count,\u201d he said, waving an orange-stained hand at me dismissively. \u201cThose are fancy foods. There are thin people in those lines to get a Cronut, and they\u2019re gonna go run 5 miles later to work it off. Nah, Gluttony is more like sitting around eating crap you don\u2019t even want to eat, but it makes you feel good for five seconds and then when you hit the bottom of the bag you feel just awful about yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh,\u201d I said, recoiling at this image. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine who would lower themselves to do that \u2013 \u201c\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re Pride,\u201d interjected Envy, her green eyes gleaming angrily. \u201cYou\u2019re literally better than everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI motivate everyone to be proud of what they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, most of us are shit,\u201d snapped Wrath, flicking his switchblade open and cleaning his nails. \u201cMost of us are shit, and act like shit to each other, and then I come along and give them some justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, bro, you make them kill each other.\u201d \n\n\u201cLike I said \u2013 Justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour problem-solving skills are weak as hell, bro,\u201d complained Lust. \u201cYou drive people apart. I bring \u2018em together. Much more effective as a vice, if you\u2019ve gotta have one \u2013 giving people a good time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they can bang and then have serious regrets the next morning,\u201d I teased. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t have enough \u2013\u201c\n\n\u201cWe *know,*\u201d interjected Envy impatiently. \u201cThey lack Pride. Pride, pride, pride! You know, you\u2019re the only one of us who doesn\u2019t have a shit reputation- \u201c\n\n\u201cNot true!\u201d interjected Sloth. \u201cEveryone loves me!\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone loves the *animal*,\u201d I corrected him. \u201cNot you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sloth was named after me. Then a white lady decided to cry about how cute I am on the Ellen show, and from then on, everyone decided to love me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do!\u201d \n\n\u201cThere are about a thousand titles on how to overcome you!\u201d I reminded him. \u201cThere\u2019s self-help books, and time-management apps, and deadlines and life coaches, all fighting you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I win, usually,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cAnd sometimes I win by making people watch two hours of baby sloth videos on the internet at three a.m. What can I say? It\u2019s great.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t get what you\u2019re all complaining about,\u201d I told the rest of the crew, who had assembled specifically to trash my good name. \u201cBecause the truth is, while the rest off you might lack some PR or whatever, everyone *does* celebrate the rest of you. Sloth has the whole self-care thing, where people slow down and get nothing done but feel happy about themselves, for whatever reason. And greed \u2013 Greed is just about a literal God these days \u2013\u201c\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Greed murmured. \u201cSome other celebrity is just bragging about their new private jet on twitter, and I want to enjoy winning over the rest of you sorry lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d I told him, and he shrugged.\n\n\u201cthe rest of y\u2019all are just poor,\u201d he said. And we could not argue. \n\n\u201cAnyway, the rest of us run this town, too,\u201d I reminded them. \u201cLust is celebrated in every bar in the world; on Tinder and Grindr and Instagram \u2013 \u201c\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d interjected Envy. \u201cI own Instagram.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat you do \u2013 and facebook \u2013\u201c\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t effing talk to me about facebook,\u201d she said. I supposed she was rather miffed at its decline in popularity.\n\n\u201cAnd snapchat,\u201d I said appeasingly.\n\n\u201cAnd snapchat,\u201d she echoed, the faintest smile curling her lips. \u201cThank the deities for snapchat.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Gluttony has the food trucks \u2013 \u201c\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re proud of eating it, it doesn\u2019t count,\u201d he reiterated.\n\n\u201cAnd that restaurant in Montreal where they serve fries cooked in duck fat.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk, that counts,\u201d he said, with a laugh.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d I said triumphantly. \u201cAll of you have something. You don\u2019t need a month. Anyway, this month isn\u2019t about the sin of pride anyway,\u201d I tried to explain. \u201cBeing proud of who you are isn\u2019t a sin. Not if you\u2019re disenfranchised.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, here we go,\u201d moaned Envy. \u201cHero of the downtrodden; champion of the oppressed. Gods, I think I\u2019m going to be sick if I hear that speech of his one more time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just accidental that I have a month, rather than other things. Envy has most of social media, and she tag-teams with Greed whenever some mogul releases another self-help book on how to make a bazillion dollars \u2013\u201c\n\n\u201cI do make people strive for more,\u201d she murmured seriously. \u201cAll the damn time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd wrath has every war in existence, and every murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the entire justice system,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing pisses off people more than re-living the crimes that\u2019ve been done to them, and nothing makes people more wrathful than rotting in prison, and nothing makes innocent people madder than the thought that murderers are alive while \u2013 \u201c\n\n\u201cWe get it,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t really need a month, now, do you.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to him,\u201d complained Envy. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get it at all.\u201d\n\nThey each wanted a month, and that was that. So they excluded me from their company, and huddled their heads together, whereupon they settled on an official division of their talents through the monthly calendar. \n\nGluttony got December, as this was only natural, given its congruence with Christian holidays, though there was some talk of a satellite festival for Ramadan. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if greed counts at night if you fast all day,\u201d he said, \u201cBut I\u2019ll take it.\u201d So Gluttony got December and Ramadan. \n\nSloth got August, that month of food festivals and summer laziness. \u201cBut in the southern hemisphere, I get January,\u201d he said, and no one complained. \n\nLust got May in springtime, the specific month in which girls start wearing short shorts and everyone unveils their supposed \u201csummer bodies,\u201d though there was a good argument made for April, that month in which every man decides to perform one-armed curls while staring at himself in the gym mirror so that he might stand flexing on a beach someday. \u201cWhy not both?\u201d he said, and the rest agreed. \n\nWrath got January, that month of December bills, and also a set of two weeks in summer \u2013 time unspecified, so it was a moveable feast of wrathfulness. Humans would know it when it was too hot to move or think and the AC broke down at home and their workplace was cooled to the temperature of an iceberg and their boss placed them on an insane summer project with uncertain cumulative moving deadlines and poor management. Wrath thought this seemed an appropriate celebration of individual, rather than patriotic, rage, and was content.\n\nGreed was indifferent. He truly was omnipresent: there when the wealthy wined and dined on summer terraces, and when they holidayed at winter chateaus. He was there at tax time, at Christmas when it is too lean and also when it is too luxurious. But finally, June was declared his month: that month of weddings, in which we are stricken with hatred for the rich wedding ceremonies of our friends, during which they also force us to spend a thousand dollars on travel, bridal attire, and presents; during which we also compare ourselves to the groom\u2019s cousin\u2019s brother, who\u2019s done very well in finance and drives a Ferrari. Or else when these friends are hippies who live on a farm and are too good for everyone, and they get married on hand-carved wooden chairs arranged in the forest while looking ethereal and being visited by deer, it is also an occasion for greediness over other people\u2019s better-seeming priorities. \n\n\u201cThings\u2019ll be different from here on in,\u201d declared Envy. \u201cAnd Pride is right \u2013 we need better PR. If it weren\u2019t for me, no one would ever better themselves \u2013\u201c\n\n\u201cOr make more money,\u201d said Greed.\n\n\u201cOr stop and smell the roses,\u201d said Sloth.\n\n\u201cOr stand up for themselves instead of being a little bitch,\u201d said Wrath.\n\n\u201cOr hook up and find love,\u201d said Lust.\n\n\u201cOr watch Guy Fieri on TV,\u201d said Gluttony, to the general laughter of all.\n\nStanding apart from the group, I smirked to myself. Oh, the rest of them, with such a high opinion of themselves. If they were the same as me, who would ever dare to claim those names they wore: Envy, Wrath, Greed, Gluttony, Sloth? It was unthinkable. \n\nI had work to do, in truth, and so I left them. I wasn\u2019t at the festival of brightly-waving rainbow flags \u2013 oh, my name was, but that was not really me. I had to make someone believe they were too good to ask for help; I had to stop their tongue from confessing how they hurt; I had to make them lie to their friends and neighbours about how they were doing; I had to half-starve them before I\u2019d let them admit they were broke as hell. \n\nI was, in fact, worse than all the rest of them put together. So let me have my name upon this month of being proud. I was too busy pushing people to distance themselves from what they were not, to care for the honour. \n\nr/eros_bittersweet",

Its seems as though Diane has heard about that Pride Month that\u2019s been going on around these parts and wants an Envy Month\u201d their Leader, Meliodas the Dragon Sin, chuckled. \n\nDiane nodded, still pouting, but turned her attention to King soon after: he had started dozing on his pillow in mid-air. \u201cKING!\u201d she whined, \u201cwe\u2019re having an \u2018Envy Month\u2019, so get ready to do\u2026 erm, envy stuff?\u201d Diane\u2019s conviction faded as she realised she had no idea what humans do on Pride Month. \n\n\u201cEnvy Month?\u201d Ban, the Fox Sin of Greed, smirked, \u201cya mean we\u2019re all gonna be jealous of each other?\u201d his usual sing-song voice grabbing everyone\u2019s attention. \n\n\u201cHey Ban,\u201d King yawned, \u201cyou\u2019re human, how do you celebrate Escanor\u2019s month?\u201d \n\nEscanor is the Lion\u2019s Sin of Pride and, as it is nighttime, was currently sitting inside the Boar Hat. He was just about to pluck up the courage to hand Merlin; the Boar\u2019s Sin of Gluttony, his poems he\u2019d been writing. \u201cHey, Escanor? can you come out here for a moment?\u201d Meliodas called into the tavern, causing Escanor to sigh and abandon his attempts to woo Merlin for another night.\n\n\u201cY-yes, Captain\u201d he stuttered, his night time personality being so timid as to be mildly afraid of even his closest friends. \u201cH-how could I be of any help?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do humans do when they celebrate your month?\u201d the Captain asked, smiling in his usual carefree manner. \u2018My month?\u2019 Escanor thought, \u2018what is the Captain\u2026 oh!\u2019 he looked around the group. A Fairy, a Giant, a Doll, a Demon, and an Immortal (or Undead as Ban preferred). \n\n\u201cOh, you mean Pride Month\u201d Escanor spoke aloud. \u201cT-that doesn\u2019t have anything to do w-with me\u201d he answered. It was something he was asked about a lot since he became the Sin of Pride. \u201cIts a celebration of the many and varied s-sexualities that humans are capable of. They parade, wave rainbow themed flags, and be happy in themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I understand. I believe I attended one such event with Slader, of the Roars of Dawn, after the Capital was rebuilt.\u201d Gowther declared, striking a pose and pointing at Escanor. \u201cI had no idea it had anything to do with sex, as I did not see anyone engaging in such acts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see\u201d Meliodas nodded to himself, \u201cwe don\u2019t have anything like that in the Demon Clan. If you love someone, then that is that: who cares what other people think?\u201d he thought about his love for a certain Goddess, and how everyone back then reacted.\n\n\u201cSo\u201d King began slowly, not fully understanding humans, \u201chumans have more than one sexuality?\u201d \n\n\u201cKinda\u201d Ban answered for Escanor, \u201csome men like other men, some women like other women. Some people like both men and women, and some don\u2019t really like either\u201d. From his time with Elaine, King\u2019s little sister, he had an idea why King was confused. \n\n\u201cOh, so those are considered different by humans then\u201d King continued, still trying to fit this concept into something he could understand. \u201cWhen Fairies fall in love,\u201d he cast a quick glance at Diane, \u201cwe don\u2019t worry about \u2018who\u2019 or \u2018what\u2019 they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Giants are pretty much the same\u201d Diane confirmed, hiding her face with her pigtails.\n\n\u201cHuh\u201d Merlin startled everyone by appearing right behind Escanor. \u201cSo it would appear that the reason the others misunderstood Pride Month is because their Clans have such relaxed views on the subject. How interesting.\u201d\n\nEveryone was silent for a while, thinking about the differences between humans and the other Clans that inhabit Brittannia. \n\n\u201cI still want an Envy Month\u201d Diane stated, folding her arms defiantly.\n\n\\--++--++--++--\n\n*Note: A bit late to this particular prompt party, but when I read the prompt to my husband I could see a* Nanatsu no Taizai *themed story forming in his mind; this is* ***his*** *contribution, not mine*. :)",

            "comment": "I clutch at the bridge of my nose in an attempt to calm my headache as Anger continues to pace back and forth fuming at me. I swear that if this leaves any wrinkles on my gorgeous face... \n\nNo amount of explanation that June is \"Pride month\" in the way of sexuality and gender identity freedom seemed to calm the group down. Even Sloth, who was usually a shapeless mass of gunk, was putting in the effort to create a human-like shape sleeping on the couch with half of her hair straightened and the rest frizzed just to show me that she was bitter about it by spouting \"I don't even care!\" here and there between Envy and Angers fuming. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, I got an idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Guys shut up! I will not strain my voice so quiet down...\" I waited until I heard was the sound of Gluttony gulping down soda from a two liter bottle and the sound of small \"ding\"s from Lust's phone as Tinder notification after notification popped up. Running my fingers through my hair to ensure it fell just the right way as they trained their eyes on me, I smiled \"What do you mean you all don't have any months devoted to you?\"  \n\n\n\"Gluttony!\" I turn to him suddenly and shock him out of his passionate consumption of an entire box of graham crackers, freezing to meet my eyes \"We all know that your month is November. I mean come on, it's the time of Thanksgiving and the weather starts to get colder so everyone just assumes it's okay to let themselves go by shoveling things into their mouth..\" Gluttony appraises me with a thumbs up and a cascade of cracker crumbs coming out of his mouth as he mutters \"Thanks Pride!\"  \n\n\n\"Sloth\" i turn towards the humanoid blob of a being that just shoots me a \"Eh\" in response. \"We all should realize that July is your month! You know, the summer is really starting to kick it and all of the classes are over and done with so people suddenly stop caring if they wake up before two in the afternoon? They don't really socialize for half the summer or do any work in July.\" I watch cautiously and feel a sense of acceptance from Sloth as her form melts into her normal blobby form.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Greed- Hey that's my purse!\" I gasp out as I catch the skinny, jeweled, middle aged woman slipping a piece of currency out of my Louis Vuitton handbag. \"Just don't take my bubblegum pink lipstick, only I can pull off that color.\" I state with a swish of my hand through my hair. \"Anyways, greed, your month is obviously December considering that all anyone can think about is what gifts they are going to receive at the end of it. How much money can they save while buying gifts? How many friends can they accumulate to go to parties with? Will they get that one or five expensive things they just... HAVE to have?\" Greed seems to be pleased that she gets her own entire month and it has Christmas AND New Years Eve in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Lust!\" I look around in a dainty looking spin only to find that Lust is nowhere to be found until I can hear the sound of kissing from her bedroom. Ugh, this is MY TIME, the attention is supposed to be on me! I walk over steaming and knock loudly only to hear her say  \n\n\n\"I am a bit busy Pride! I have a lady friend over do you mind if we talk later?\"  \n\"Actually I am a dude\"  \n\"Oh honey I am so sorry. Pride I have a man friend over do you mind if we talk later?\"  \n\n\nI roll my eyes and call back out to my pansexual friend \"I was just saying that February is definitely your own month considering the fact that Valentine's Day is smack in the middle and all anyone can think about the entire time is getting with someone and/or getting some.\" I have to guess if Lust agreed or not since all I get in response is the sound of squeezing bedsprings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turn towards Envy who is glaring at the ruby ring on Greed's finger. The two of them are twins that never seem to get along, always fighting over possessions that none of them really need. Which is fine since all of them look pretty but still it is a struggle to get his attention. \"Envy, your month is obviously August.\" Envy looks totally lost, but soon mutters that he wish he had clear skin like mine. Doesn't everyone? I smile brightly \"Think about it, it's when school is back in session and everyone is trying to look better than everyone else. It's when you get jealous that one girl has breasts larger than yours or that that one coworker got that vacation trip that you had been planning in your head for forever. It's when the end of summer is so close and you suddenly realize that you didn't do so many things that other people got to do, get to do soon or have and all you want is to take it from them.\"  \n\n\nEnvy is not communicative, instead turning to his sister and arguing that the red jewel would look much better on him. Anger is almost immediately in my face \"Why the fuck am I last? Am I the least important to you-\" I cut him off with a finger on his lips \"Shhh look into my pretty eyes, believe me you are not the least important, your month actually starts the year. January, think about it. Everyone is getting out of the holidays and realizing just how much weight they gained and they now have some sort of year goal bred from anger at themselves that they have to accomplish. On top of that, the winter is really starting to drag on and everyone is angry at the weather, wanting it to get warmer.\" And that seems to sate him enough to send him grumbling angrily elsewhere.  \n\n\nAll of my friends go about their normal lives, their issues sated and the arguing stopped.   \n\n\nWhat can I say, I am obviously amazing. The best of the group by far.",

He adjusted his bow-tie, smoothing it. \"I, ah, think you've misunderstood.\"  \n\"You'll misunderstand my fist in a minute...\" Wrath said, fidgeting with an armour-spike. He screwed his firey eyes up, looking into the distance. \"There's only 12 months total, there'll be more time about us than NOT at this rate. And what about the Virtues?\"  \n\"Psh, fuck the Virtues,\" piped up Greed, waving a hand. \"No one can even name them.\"\n\n\"Ah--\"  \n\"I still don't get why Pride is the first month.

FInally, Pride spoke up. \"It's, ah, well, it pains to have to admit this... But Pride month is not, ah, actually about yours truly.\"  \nEveryone looked at him. Lust's painted nails tapped over her phone. She read, then laughed. Then laughed and laughed. \"Of COURSE it is!\"\n\n\"What? What?\"\n\n\"Lol, those sluts.\"  \n\"Whaaat?\"\n\nLust waved them off. She pointed to Pride, holding in laughter, waiting for him to explain.\n\nPride turned pink. \"Oh, I don't... Does it matter? Let's get back on topic, who has our dark lord Lucifer's meeting apology email?\"\n\nA metal hand slammed onto the padding on Pride's suit shoulders. Pride looked into Wrath's firey eyes.\n\n\"Right. Um. Well. It's, ah, it's, ah... Well, it's gay people.\"\n\nSilence.  \n\"Queer people, I should say. LGBTQIA+ etc, as they say. They're, ah, proud to be them.\"  \nMore silence. Pride waved a tiny, imaginary flag.  \n\"We're here...we're queer.\"  \nWrath smashed the table again. \"WELL WHERE IS GAY WAR DAY??\"",

            "comment": "The \"room\" was silent, only quiet snores echoed throughout the large space. The \"meeting room\", as they called it, was a rather empty white void, except for the expensive long table made out of bocote wood and the six rather odd beings that sat in similarly expensive chairs. They were all the seven deadly sins, except one was missing. It was Pride, a purple-skinned being with peacock feathers and a beak. \n\nThe non-existent ticking of the non-existent clock started to tick off everyone who sat there, except Sloth, who was sleeping as usual. Pride was the only reason this meeting was called and yet, the damn sin didn't even show up!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Let's give Pride two more minutes, then we can dismiss the meetin',\" Gluttony, unable to resist its evergrowing hunger any longer (It was a miracle it didn't break sooner), scowled and just like that, an entire feast appeared in front of the sin and only the sin. \n\n\"Why? So we can watch you stuff your lazy-ass? Do you think we can't summon stuff, too?\" Envy snarled at the fat sin with a pig snout and ears, its snake tail rattling as it grew more and more impatient.\n\n\"Envy, please,\" the yellow sin rolled his frog-like eyes and then returned to examining the penny in its webbed talons.\n\nThe silence started to overtake once more, the impatient tapping coming from Wrath getting increasingly louder until-\n\nThe clicking of heels came from the distance and most of the sins perked up, knowing very well who it was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"And here comes yours, truly!\" The obnoxious voice yelled, the sin appearing seemingly out of nowhere as it took its seat next to the light blue, sleeping Sloth. Sloth barely even opened its eyes, then went back to its dreamless rest.\n\n\"FINALLY!\" The booming voice of Wrath's echoed throughout the room, startling both Envy and Lust. The voice was like a lion's roar, which was fitting, considering that Wrath had a mane and feline features.\n\n\"What do you mean finally? Was I late?\" Pride pondered to itself, but then shook its head in dismissal, \"No, impossible. Anyway, what's this about again?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You cannot tell me that you forgot. Especially when this is about you and that stupid thing going on right now.\" Greed huffed, shoving the penny into its pocket and straightening its waistcoat.\n\n\"Oh? Really? Oh, geez! How could I?\" Pride chuckled and leaned over the table, \"So, what thing?\"\n\n\"What thing? What thing??\" The jealous sin's slit eyes widened, \"This thing!\"\n\nIt took one quick wave and a large projection above them all was summoned, showing a map of the entire world. Another quick wave and it zoomed onto a seemingly random area in America. It took a second for everyone to realize what it was showing, but the six sins eventually got it, except, once again, for the seventh one. \n\n\"And? It's people running around with rainbows drawn on their faces! What's that got to do with me? Are you mocking me? That's so low of you all, I'm not that over the top,\" Pride shook its head and crossed its arms across its chest.\n\n\"OH YOU LITTLE SACK OF SHIT! DON'T YOU DARE LIE TO US! WE KNOW DAMN WELL THAT IT'S YOU WHO ARRANGED THIS PARADE JUST TO MOCK US!\" Wrath boomed, jumping from his seat and pointing accusingly at the smug sin who had no idea what was going on.\n\n\"Honey, acting confused is not helping you. Look at them, they are basking in pride and pride alone!\" Lust piped in, nodding towards the thousands of people running around, colorful clothes and flags all around the place, \"It's like it was made for you! It's almost like they are praising you! Not that I don't like the amount of skin showing, but still!\"\n\n\"Hoo-ho! Wait, really?\" Pride stood up, looking intently at the screen.\n\n\"Stop playing dumb. You know very well that none of us agreed to nor even knew about this and yet you went and forced all of the insolent mortals to celebrate your idiotic functions as a sin. We deserve it too! This isn't fair! It isn't! It's not!\" Envy's fists hit the table at least six times as it threw a small fit, looking like a child.\n\n\"Guys, my lovely sins, as much as I hate to not take credit for such a flattering event, this isn't my doing. I can't stop those humans from doing what they want, now can I?\" \n\nWrath snarled, staring down one of the couples. It was a man, kissing another. Something wasn't right here.\n\n\"Pride, it has your goddamn name in it! Pride Parade! It's a parade about celebrating pride, Pride. That's you.\" Greed pointed a talon at the sin, its eye twitching.\n\n\"Pride... parade..\" Wrath mumbled, which was unusual. Wrath was usually a loud sin, so everyone turned their attention to it. \"Pride... parade..\" Its crimson red, glowing eyes kept shifting from the screen to Pride, growing wider and wider.\n\n\"What is it, Wrath, dear?\" Lust questioned, leaning over the table rather inappropriately.\n\n\"Ya know, your mumblin' is... crunch.. scarin'... burp... me.\" Gluttony eyed the sin as it continued to shove food into its mouth, the growing pile of bones and other leftovers now spread across half of the table.\n\nMore mumbling filled the void, most of the words incoherent at that point: \"Spit it out already, gorilla!\" Envy snapped, starting to drag out the s', a habit of its.\n\n\"Pride parade... I don't it's about.. pride as.. the sin and all..\" Wrath's brows furrowed.\n\nLust looked up once again and after a moment of silent pondering, the sin's eyes started to widen in realization too as it clutched onto its horns: \"Oh my god! How could I have not realized this sooner?\"\n\n\"What??\" Greed run a hand through its hair, puzzled, just like the rest of the sins. \n\n\"Oooh!\" Pride chuckled, also realizing what this was all about, \"Oh! Oh. Oh...\"\n\n\"Am I dumb or are you all suddenly just pulling a prank on me or something?\" Envy glared.\n\n\"Pride parades, also known as pride marches, pride events, and pride festivals, are outdoor events celebrating lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer, or LGBTQ if you want, social and self acceptance, achievements, legal rights and pride..\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA mumbling, though fast voice butted into the conversation and it didn't take long for them to realize it was Sloth, who immediately after fell asleep once more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Oh.\" Envy, Gluttony and Greed let out in unison.",

That's not what pride month is! The humans made it up to support their LGBTQ+ people, its not actually about me!\" Pride supplictaed with the other six\n\n\"Whatever! You've always thought you were better then the rest of us and you know it!\" Wrath says through clenched teeth. \"Trying to fool us, \"oh no it's not about me! I promise\", what a lie!\" Wrath sardonically says mimicking Pride.\n\n\"If you dont believe me just go down to earth and watch the humans do one of their pride parades! You'll see then it's not about me!\" Implored Pride.\n\n\"What if I dont want to?\" Sloth spake with eyes half closed\n\n\"No Sloth we're going, all of us! Then we will see just how much Pride is full of himself and watch as his grandiose plans crumble!\" Wrath says with a cynical smile.",

            "comment": "\u201cGOD FUCKING DAMN IT\u201d screamed Wrath as his slammed his clenched fists onto the meeting room table, sending a minor shockwave to rattle across it and shake the numerous cups of coffee and paperwork scattered across it \u201cTHIS IS COMPLETE FUCKING BULLSHIT. ABSOLUTE GOD DAMN SHITTING BULLFUCK\u201d. Wrath\u2019s Eyes were lit up like lanterns, and the hairs on the back of his neck stood up, pricking all over his blood red skin. \n\n\u201cRelax sugarbuns\u201d Came a sultry voice from across the table, one that seemed to weave and ripple through everyone\u2019s ears, sending a shudder through their spines. Lust smirked at the intoxicating effect she had over the other sins and slinked upwards to her feet. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t get yourself so worked up, darling\u201d. Her words trailed off her tongue like a lollipop \u201cI think it\u2019s cute that Pride here finally got to show off his... talents\u201d. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not fair!\u201d Envy chirped up from his chair.\nHe was a small figure, barely 4 feet tall, always having to shout to be heard of everyone else. His face was damp with tears and his cheeks beat red. \u201cHow come Pride gets to have an entire month dedicated to him, and I get shafted. I-it isn\u2019t fair!\u201d. With that, the tears came, streaming down his freckled cheeks. His cries of jealously quickly morphed into indistinguishable hicks and sobs before he broke into full bawling. \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s bullshit!\u201d Gluttony spat out in between mouthfuls Of roast beef \u201cLittle bastard like him-\u201c he stopped to take another massive bite out of the entire roast sitting in front of him, smothered in gravy and numerous spices \u201c-getting his own damn month... fuckin\u2019 pig. I oughta... god this is good.... I oughta teach him a lesson\u201d. Finally finishing his mini rant, Gluttony let out a hearty burp and a chuckle before returning to his one man feast \n\nPride sighed to himself before running a comb through his perfect hair. He smirked and flashed his pearly white teeth to everyone present. The other sins glared at him. He was the smuggest prick in the entire underworld, worse than that jackass Pan and his stupid pipes. \n\n\u201cYou lot need to chill\u201d Pride sneered, his words seeping out from his mouth like waste leaking from a sewer pipe. \u201cAs much as I deserve a parade dedicated to my ~perfection~, I\u2019m afraid this one isn\u2019t my game. I\u2019m disappointed to be honest, I really wish the people of the in between would take the time to celebrate my beauty\u201d. A shit eating grin stretched across his face and he chuckled to himself. \n\n\u201cUp yours, You cocksure little freak\u201d Greed snapped out while opening his trench coat and shoving the most expensive looking crockery on the table into it. \u201cWe can\u2019t all be perfect like you\u201d \n\n\u201cI know\u201d Pride snorted before taking a sip of his wine \u201cOtherwise there\u2019d be no point in living\u201d \n\nThe others glared him down. There was a small\nMoment of dead silence before Wrath suddenly exploded into action \n\n\u201cWE HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING\u201d he practically yelled, shaking the table slightly \u201cWE CAN\u2019T BE SECOND FIDDLE TO THIS LITTLE UPSTART. WE\u2019LL FIND A WAY TO GET OUR OWN PARADES. ENTIRE MONTHS DEDICATED TO OUR GLORY\u201d \n\nEnvy chirped up from behind a waterfall of tears \n\u201cT-that\u2019s a good idea\u201d he blubbered \u201cB-but What If no one w-wants to c-c-elebrate\u201d. He barely finished speaking before erupting into tears again. \n\n\u201cShut it twerp\u201d chortled Gluttony in between mouthfuls of schnitzel and bratwurst \u201cYou\u2019re- *BURP* getting on my nerves\u201d\n\n\u201cRIGHT\u201d screamed Wrath \u201cANY IDEAS ON HOW WE\u2019LL PULL THIS ONE OFF? SLOTH, YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD?\u201d \n\nThere was a moment of silence as everyone turned to the slightly tubby green skilled fellow, who had his head resting on the table. He didn\u2019t speak at first and everyone glanced at each other, thinking maybe he\u2019d actually died and no one had realised, before he finally spoke. His words came out a snails pace and he held the gap between each one for far longer than needed. \n\n\u201cWe........ we should....... we..... I... can\u2019t remember\u201d he slurred out before snoring replaced his speech and he fell back to sleep \n\n\u201cWell that was a complete waste of time\u201d said Lust. She pondered to herself briefly before snapping her fingers in a eureka moment \n\n\u201cWe could get the boss to cast one of those old hypno spells over everyone and force them too. Worked really well in that Jonestown place\u201d she hissed out \n\n\u201cNot bad, sunshine\u201d Pride smirked \u201cbut wouldn\u2019t that be cheating\u201d \n\n\u201cFUCK YOU PRIDE\u201d Wrath yelled, raising his fist and bringing it down upon the table, smashing it to thousands of pieces and throwing Sloth up into the air and crashing back to the floor, where he continued to sleep \u201cJUST BECAUSE YOU GOT A DEDICATION MONTH YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE HOT SHIT\u201d \n\n\u201cDarling, I always think that\u201d he snorted, sticking a tooth pick into his fangs and picking out a finger nail. \n\n\u201cWrath has a point\u201d Greed snarled, picking up a golden fork from the floor and shoving into his pocket \u201cI propose you\u2019re excluded from the rest of the meeting. All in favour?\u201d \n\nThere was a collective \u201caye\u201d from the group of sins (minus Pride). The room fell silent and Pride shrugged his shoulders. \n\n\u201cWhatever\u201d he chuckled \u201cI\u2019ve got business to attend to anyhow. A whole night of staring in the mirror. Ciao\u201d\n\nWith that, Pride slinked out of the room and disappeared from sight. The room was quiet once more and everyone glanced at each other, waiting for the next word in. Finally, Gluttony spoke \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long one isn\u2019t it? Coffee anyone?\u201d \n\nThe other sins nodded in unison and the bulbously overweight man shifted from\nHis chair and waddled over to the coffee pot, ready for the long night of discussion ahead.",

            "comment": "As he fit his key to the lock, he braced himself for the calamity that he knew was waiting for him inside the small apartment. But, for once, they all seemed to be relatively civil as he walked into the apartment. Sloth was playing video games with Envy, Lust was on her phone as usual, and Wrath and Greed were playing a game of chess so quietly intense that Pride felt that he would be pushed away by the atmosphere surrounding them if he tried to walk towards them.\n\n\"Hey Pride,\" Envy called over his shoulder, his eyes never leaving the screen as his character punched Sloth's over and over. Sloth didn't look like he was trying, but Pride knew better.\n\n\"Hey,\" Pride said as he brought in his arm full of groceries. \"Where's Gluttony?\"\n\n\"In his room playing that MMO still. And that's ANOTHER pawn for me,\" Greed snickered as he claimed his opponent's piece. Wrath growled like a wounded animal, low and menacing.\n\nLust looked away from her phone to look at Pride as he started putting away the groceries. \"Need some help there, handsome?\" she asked in her usual sultry voice. And even though Pride knew she didn't mean it as a come on, it was just how she was, he still felt his heart rate increase from the brief attention.\n\n\"No, I got it,\" he said instantly, tossing the gallon of milk in the fridge.\n\n\"Typical Pride,\" she said in her singsong voice. \"Someone's letting this month get to them.\"\n\n\"Look, I've told you all a dozen times this month, Pride Month has nothing to do with-\"\n\n\"Does it though?\" Wrath interjected, sharp and clear. He slammed a knight onto Greed's queen, who groaned as it was swept off the board. \"Don't lie to me. This was clearly your idea!\"\n\n\"It's about the LGBT community standing up for what they believe in, which of course is a prideful\u00a0act, but it's got nothing to do with me. Wouldn't I take credit if I did it?\" Pride said, and all six of the other sins, even Sloth, nodded as if this made sense.\u00a0Finally. Maybe now they'll stop bugging him about it.\n\n\"I still think it should have been called Lust month,\" Lust said, turning back to her phone. She was swiping right on every face that came across her screen, both male and female. \"It just makes sense. It's more a celebration of choices in sexuality, right?\"\n\n\"That's part of it,\" Greed admitted, \"but I think it's more about awareness for them. Like 'hey, we're out the closet now bitches, look at us,' you know? So Pride month fits a little more. Plus humans are still a little too scared of talking about sexuality that openly to make a holiday for it.\"\n\nLust smirked and held her phone up to Greed. \"Not online they aren't. And did you forget Valentine's Day, sweetie?\"\n\n\"Must be nice,\" Envy said as his character was getting beat to a pulp by Sloth, who waited until his energy bar was full to beat him with a finishing attack. \"Humans won't ever dedicate a holiday to wanting stuff.\"\n\n\"...Christmas?\" Sloth asked, his word slurred. Envy smirked.\n\n\"Not the same thing. Christmas is about GIVING people stuff, not WISHING you had more stuff. But the aftermath of Christmas... now that's something I could get behind. What was that one movie, where the guy tried to make Christmas 2 a holiday? That's my shit right there,\" Envy said as they began the next round.\u00a0\n\n\"Christmas belongs to ya boy here,\" Greed said. \"Also, check, old man. Try not to flip the board this time.\"\n\nWrath growled under his throat as he moved his pieces into a defensive position, something he loathed doing with all his being.\n\n\"Sloth gets lazy holidays, like New Year's Eve,\" Pride said, and Sloth nodded slowly. \"What's Gluttony get?\"\n\n\"Thanksgiving,\" all the other sins said simultaneously. Pride's cheeks burned.\n\n\"Nobody wants to celebrate me,\" Wrath chuckled, but even that sound had an inexplicable edge. \"Except maybe politicians and mafias.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Lust said. \"Honestly, baby, I think Wrath is more taboo than sex these days. It's not until wartime that you get any kind of boost, huh?\"\n\nWrath nodded as he slammed his queen onto the board, making the pieces bounce. \"Checkmate.\"\n\n\"Pride, you can deny it all you want, but I still think Pride month is about you,\" Envy said.\n\n\"Nah. Veteran's Day, birthdays, those are me. Because they fit the original definition: a feeling of satisfaction derived from one's own achievements or from qualities that are widely admired. But these people fit a new definition that they made for themselves: confidence and self-respect expressed by members of a group, typically a marginalized one, on the basis of a shared identity, culture, or experience.\"\n\n\"But they did it in your name!\" Envy persisted. \"They celebrate the individual as a unit! That's the most Pride thing I've ever heard.\"\n\n\"Pride is about the self!\" Pride said, stomping his foot on the linoleum. \"It doesn't make sense to be prideful with others!\"\n\"Easy there Highlander,\" Greed mumbled, and Pride rolled his eyes.\n\n\"I'm saying, it's a good thing,\" Envy insisted. \"Just quit being so damn stubborn and include their definition with your own, for once! Think of all that power you're relinquishing by not doing so!\"\n\n\"You're right, it would be a lot of power,\" Pride admitted, \"but it wouldn't feel right. Honestly... I feel like I'd be tarnishing something they worked so hard to make attaching myself to it.\"\n\nThe other sins were thoughtful for a moment, shocked at this unusual thought.\n\n\"You're just upset you didn't think of it yourself,\" Greed finally said, and Pride threw a bag of chips at his head.",

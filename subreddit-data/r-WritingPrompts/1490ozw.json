            "comment": "\"Dead? Really? He's really... dead?\" \n\nCoruzar stared out across his fruit fields in shocked disbelief at what he was hearing, trembling fingers nearly dropping the conch shell through which he listened. A faint murmur could be heard from inside, unintelligible to anyone else; though it sounded annoyed.\n\n\"No, no. Its not that I don't believe you. It's just... he fell down a well? Really?\"\n\nThe murmuring continued.\n\n\"Exactly! After everything I taught him? It just seems so... anticlimactic.\"\n\nAnd again. \n\n\"Yes, yes. The prophecy. I don't know what to make of that either. Is it possible that we... read it wrong?\"\n\n...\n\n\"No I'm not doubting your reading comprehension! It might just have been misrecorded.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Yes, someone will have to do something about tha\u2014\"\n\nCoruzar was beginning to look worried now, the reality of the situation dawning upon him.\n\n\"You want. You want me to do it? You know that I'm retired.\" \n\nThe mumbling sounded rather angry now.\n\n\"Fine! Fine. I'll just beat him down with my walking staff shall I? Throw a few firecrackers at him? Maybe he'll be intimidated by one of my gourds!\" He tossed the shell out over the balcony, into the bushes below.\n\nCoruzar sighed deeply, and then with great effort, heaved himself out of the wicker armchair. His spine creaked and groaned, bending to a hunch; knees clicked and popped in their attempt to support the spindly frame above them. Robes reluctantly trailed along the floor as he hobbled inside, stopping to grab a rather limp looking wizard hat off of a stand. It was time to prepare, for whatever that would be worth. Soon he'd be joining his apprentice, as would the rest of the circle most likely. Might as well go out with a bang.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe village burned. Soot blackened the sky. Men and women face down in the dirt, splayed out across the streets. Through the flames a most terrifying silhouette; the death knight approached. Black armour, black sword, blackest heart. Where he moved, shadows followed. Coruzar awaited in the centre of it all, hanging dearly on by his staff. Eyes tired, face grim. The knight stopped to face him.\n\n\"*You are not Tilanil. Begone. Our final battle awaits!*\" The raspy voice could cut stone. Each word seemed even to draw colour from the world. The death knight rose his hefty weapon towards the venerable wizard; whispers creeping off of its blade.\n\n\"Oh he didn't think you were worth it. Had deeper, darker threats to face or something. So you got me instead.\" Coruzar spread his arms in emphasis, nearly collapsing before forgetting his staff.\n\n\"*You... your presence insults me. I will make them all scream after I am done with you.*\"\n\n\"Not if I stop you.\" Coruzar squatted down, pointing the end of his staff towards the knight. A trail of flacid sparks erupted from the end it. \"Oh dear.\"\n\n\"*They sent you to humour me? I will return them your head.*\" \n\nThe knight moved towards the quivering wizard, closing the distance quickly with great stride. He rose his sword, its blade sought murder. In desperation, Coruzar tried to catch it with his staff, but it was swiftly redirected. The pommel struck his jaw, sending him to the ashen ground.\n\n\"*Is that all?*\" The words were spoken with such malice, but there was almost a tinge of disappointment in them. He rose his sword once more, that wrinkled old neck his target\u2014but he spied the mage fumbling with something under those dusty robes. His great gauntlets pushed their way inside, grabbing something. A small cylinder? \"*What is this?*\"\n\nCoruzar smiled a shit-eating grin, his face inches from the black knight's visor.\n\n\"I call it a hand grenade.\"\n\nIn a flash, the world turned white.",

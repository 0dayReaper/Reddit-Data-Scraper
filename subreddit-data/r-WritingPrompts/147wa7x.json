            "comment": "The piece of paper in my hands was easy enough to understand. The note on it was written plainly and left little to interpretation. I read it to myself several times and, once satisfied that I understood it completely, crumpled it up and stuffed it in my pocket.\r  \n\r  \nHow I had gotten here was a far more interesting mystery than the note. I had woken up that morning hungover. I sat in bed and contemplated calling out of work. Then I remembered I had lost my job the day before which was why I had been drinking so excessively. I wasn\u2019t particularly devastated about this but it was a good excuse to tell the bartender.\r  \n\r  \nAfter a mug of stale coffee and a breakfast of week-old pizza, I was tased. Then I woke up here.\r  \n\r  \nA fluorescent light above me flickered and I instinctively tapped my pocket with the note in it. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cHere is a shotgun. Kill everything that moves,\u201d I recalled aloud.\r  \n\r  \nI looked down at my feet where a shotgun sat unceremoniously on the shiny tiles. Then I looked around. I was in a wax museum. Or at least, what I assumed was a wax museum. I had never been to one. \r  \n\r  \nThe enormous domed room was filled with life-size wax figures. I recognized most of them despite their squished and melty features. There were no clear exits or even windows and the curved walls were lined with fake Roman columns. Then, I lifted the shotgun. It was heavier than I had anticipated. People in movies made it seem weightless.\r  \n\r  \nI brought it up to my face and stared down the barrel. I didn\u2019t know how to use a shotgun. I hadn\u2019t even shot a BB gun.\r  \n\r  \nNow, at this point, I had a realization that drove a shiver down my spine. Sweat dripped down my face as I watched the lifeless figures stand at attention around me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cKill everything that moves,\u201d I repeated quietly. \r  \n\r  \nSuddenly, the light died. I heard the waxy shuffle of something moving behind me. Holding my breath, I swiveled carefully on my heels.\r  \n\r  \nLooming above me was all six foot four inches of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s demented wax copy. He stared down at me with his cold beady eyes. He smelled like candles.\r  \n\r  \nI whimpered. \u201cHi Mr. President. I really enjoyed your work with, uh, the civil war and all that.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nFaux-braham Lincoln said nothing. Instead, he knocked the shotgun out of my hands and sent me hurtling across the room. I crashed into the wax version of the Golden Girls and mentally thanked Betty White for cushioning my fall.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAbe, I know you appreciate honesty and if I\u2019m being honest, I do not want to be here right now.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe wax creature once again said nothing. He stomped towards me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d I gasped as I clambered up. I remembered the note in my pocket and as I crouched behind Princess Di for protection, I pulled it out. The note gave me purpose. I peered past my wax defenses and squinted into the darkness.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to kill Abraham Lincoln, aren\u2019t I?\u201d",

            "comment": "The last time Tim saw a gun was when he went on a hunting trip with his granddad, whom he was named after, Timothy Hayward Jones. Big Tim, as everyone called him, was a retired army colonel and a big, imposing man standing at 6'4\" and weighing 250 pounds. He wanted Tim to follow in his footsteps and become a strong man, hence the hunting trip. However, it became clear that Tim was nothing like his namesake.\n\nNow, Tim finds himself in the midst of a freaking zombie apocalypse, just like the ones from the movies. The only difference is that these creatures aren't slow, as one might expect. No, these motherfuckers are fast. One moment of distraction or a slow reaction could be the last thing you do. And that brings me to my current predicament.\n\nGeorge, who has appointed himself as the leader of their ragtag group, approaches Tim and hands him a pump shotgun. \n\"Here's a shotgun, kill everything that moves,\" and then walks off to rejoin the group. \nTim silently curses George,  \"Gee, thanks, dick,\" as he looks at the shotgun in his hands. Using a pump shotgun to defend against zombies is basically a death sentence for Tim. What is he supposed to do if a horde of zombies comes running after him? Well, he hopes there are none around because his only chance at survival is if there's just one zombie.\n\nGeorge wasn't always such a dick. He used to be an okay guy whom Tim occasionally ran into when his grandpa sent him on errands to the gun store. But I guess given the circumstances, anyone would behave the way George does. \"I guess owning the only gun store in Clearwaters guarantees you safety in an apocalypse.\"\n\nGrowing up around a grandpa like Big Tim meant growing up around guns. However, that doesn't mean Tim is a skilled marksman. He knows that using a shotgun against these motherfuckers is inviting death, and George knows this too, having given shooting lessons to Tim when he was younger.",

            "comment": "There was a serious flaw with this instruction, however. Not everything that moves can be killed. Not everything that moves is alive. I happened to have been given this instruction while standing underneath a tree in fall. I shot a lot of leaves. And I shot the leaves many times as they kept moving, as they could not be killed.\n\nThere was a second flaw with the instructions. One could interpret the instruction as commanding me to kill everything capable of movement, which is most things. Unfortunately, the person who handed me the shot gun was one of these things. He was shot a lot too. He died though, unlike the leaves.\n\nThe third flaw was that the shotgun moved, and it had very limited ammo. I bashed the shotgun into the tree, attempting to kill both the shotgun and the tree. I was pretty proud of how efficient I was being. I took the tree at its scientific word that by cutting it in half it was probably dead, even if it wasn't dead yet.\n\nThe fourth flaw was that I am a thing capable of movement, and I had been actively moving. Without the shot gun or ammo, I essentially slapped myself to death as I stomped on the leaves around me trying to kill them.\n\nIt was not a dignified death, but I believe it taught the scientists many lessons. Instructions to an AI revived corpse designed to kill needs to be much more specific.\n\nEnd of report.",

            "comment": "The men were running for their lives. The demons were never supposed to make it this far. Unfortunately, he didn't have the option of running away like the others.\n\nLooking down at his hands, the shotgun is cold, heavy and awkward to carry. He had never used a weapon before this, and he didn't have the luxury of time or resources to train.\n\nBut... He had his orders.\n\nHe didn't have to wait long to act on them either. A black, scaly hand grabbed the corner of the hallway, crambling the concrete as it did.\n\nCalmly walking forward, he reached the demon's face as it made the turn. It hadn't even noticed him when he pressed the trigger.\n\nBlood and guts exploded outwards in a shower of gore. Shotguns these days were built different.\n\n\"That was easy.\" He couldn't help but think. It didn't bring him any joy, however. It only made him wonder how much easier it would have been if everyone hasn't run away.\n\nLetting out a sigh, he continued past the demon's corpse.\n\nBefore he could move ten steps, however, something assaulted him. It felt like a jolt of energy too mild to be a teaser and unlike anything he had ever experienced.\n\nIt had locked up his movements for only a second, but after that he felt good. Beyond just good, he felt stronger.\n\nLooking behind him at the demon's corpse, a pile of dust laid at his feet. This was getting interesting. The jolt of energy was somewhat strong and during a fight it may as well bring his end, but he would be careful about it now that he knew it existed. \n\nMore importantly, if killing these demons made you stronger... An smile formed on his face and he couldn't wipe it off. \n\nHis next steps were surer and faster. Soon he was running along the hallways searching for demons. He needed to do some testing, and one wasn't nearly enough. \n\nThe next demon he met took him by surprise and it also almost took his head.\n\nWithout panicking, he duck down and rolled forward, avoiding its claws and lashing tail. Then, it only took a click. \n\nA football sized hole was visible in it's torso, and it stumbled back. And for a good measure, he also made the head disappear with the same magic trick. \n\nRemembering to reload, he took a moment to remember how it was done and get the bullets. Then as he did, the energy hit him. This time he was paying careful attention at the demon's corpse, so he saw how it turned to dust and energy. Energy that flowed towards him. \n\nThe jolt wasn't nearly as powerful this time, and he was getting used to it. \n\nClicking on his helmet, a panel appeared with his current health condition, stamina, heart rate and time. \n\nHe laughed as he spoke out loud. \"Would you look at the time, it's one past demon o' clock and I'm already late for my next victim.\" \n\nIs this what they say, learn to love your job and you will never work a day in your life? \n\nPoor demons, they found the one place to start their invasion that they shouldn't have. His workplace.",

You understand me?\u201d He stated in a booming voice \n\n\"Yes, Sir.\u201d I shouted back, over the loud aircraft engine. My squad   \nlined up next to me in\n\nfront of the drop pods. We loaded ourselves into the drop pods.\n\nMy squad was composed of four people: me the Lieutenant, Dot the sniper, Rek the scout,\n\nand Tare the spartan.\n\nSound vanished as soon as we entered the drop pods. The soundproof capsules were \n\ncreated to survive reentry into the atmosphere. Suddenly, it was as if I entered zero grav, then\n\ngravity seemed reversed, then it was as if I was being torn in half. All of the sudden, my\n\ncybernetic knees felt as if they were about to break, and the force of the ground against my\n\nbody left my teeth chattering.\n\nThe drop pod doors Blew open with small explosive charges and me, Dot, and Rek all \n\nflopped out. \u201cEveryone ok?\u201d I asked laying belly first on the black sand we landed on.\n\n\u201cI am accounted for.\u201d Dot said, even though he was the frailest out of all of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cAhhhhh, im ok\u201d Rek groaned, his perfectly combed hair messed up from the drop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA 270 pound, 7 foot tall man climbed out of his drop pod made especially to \n\naccommodate him. \u201cI\u2019m fine sir.\u201d Tare said, seemingly unfazed.\n\nI stood up and looked around; my squad and I were in the black dessert of hell. This is \n\nwhere our target is, the Coffin Crown. The wearer of the Coffin Crown is cursed to be a frail\n\nold man for eternity with the crown nailed in his skull, however they will beagle to understand\n\nthe language of demons as well as curse demons allowing the wearer to locate them in any\n\nlocations. The appearance of the coffin crown is still a mystery, however we know it has nails\n\nthat drive into the wearer's skull on it.\n\nAt the corner of my eye I see a puff of smoke move unnaturally. Thinking back to the co-\n\npilots instructions, I fired my shotgun at it, almost as a joke. A charred demon about 3 feet tall\n\nmanifested from the smoke and charged me, teeth first. Swiftly, Tare grabbed its skull and\n\ncrushed it with the use of his power gloves.\n\n\u201cHmm so I guess the co-pilot was right, we can't even trust smoke.\u201d I said adrenaline \n\npumping.",

As I stared my neighbor Synts grabbed a sploke out of his yard used to comb the ground for orgalt's and he poked it.  \n\n\n   The Thing shuddered before slowly rising off the land. It Spoke loudly incredibly loudly, my sensors screamed in protest as did my neighbors who writhed on the floor, the unnatural creature realizing its mistake lowered its tone by quite a lot coming down to our volume level, it was still loud but not debilitatingly so. It whirred and spouted off gibberish in a sort of confident tone. I spoke \"W-what? We can't understand you,\" I looked to my neighbor who spoke three more languages than I and he flexed his cortum.  \n\n\n   The object unfurled its head whirring objects opening to display an image, one of what appeared to be another life form. It had a head like us but every part of it was completely different in placements and unknown uses. I studied the image it had limbs but looked nothing like the unnatural beast before us. I spoke again my crunth opening and closing its wytom trying to sense the creature's life but being confused by the absence of blood or shell and organ. \"I am Darmta, can you understand us?\"  \n\n\n   As the creature made noises they slowly became more familiar, it repeated what I had said if a bit garbled \"I am Derrick, can zix undertrudb us?\" it seemed to struggle with our language clicks messing up any time we added one.  \n\n\n   As I studied it curious and terrified the government came taking it into a cargo buntal. while curious I knew they would take care of it, staring at the new hole in our community area I uneasily went back to my home.\"",

            "comment": "*Wow, well isn't this quite something?*\n\nYou blink, as if you can't quite believe what you're hearing. \n\n*Yes, yes, you're not imagining it. I'm, \"speaking\" to you I suppose is how you would understand it*\n\n\"B...but,\" you say out loud and a couple of the other specimens stare to look at you in confusion. \n\n*Now, now. There is no need to speak out loud. I will be able to hear your thoughts. Your kind comes along so rarely, I would hate for you to get taken in to some prison and electrified*\n\n\"Electrocuted actually,\" you say, this time in your head. Then you shake your head, as if you can't believe what you just \"said.\" \"Wait...I...you...\"\n\n*Use your words, now*\n\nMy mocking tone momentarily angers you, clearing your thoughts. \"Who, no, *what* are you?\" you say, again, in your head.   \n\n*Ah but you know already, don't you? You were just thinking about it*\n\nYou blink and frown. \"I was thinking about....something.\" Your frown deepens. \"I know what I was thinking about, I am thinking about it right now, and when I do, everything sort of goes blurry and I feel like I'm watching myself in third person...but I couldn't tell you what exactly I'm thinking about...\" \n\n*Precisely!* \n\nMy sudden excitement makes you jerk. Sometimes I forget how sensitive you folk you are. \n\n*Apologies for that, quite rude of me. But regardless, what you're feeling, there is no way to describe it in your language. Your language is bound inherently by the three dimensions, by a limited scope, which is all most of your kind is capable of seeing.*\n\n\"Limited scope?\" you retort, \"what sort of bullshit is that?\" You're angry, understandably; after all, I've just insulted your species.\n\n*You know full well what I mean. Look around yourself, your fellow people, this...transport that you're in. What do you see?*\n\nYour eyes widen, and you look around, your head jerking from left to right, up and down, out the windows, *beyond* the windows. You are like a child who has just been born into a new world. In a sense, you are exactly that. Then you look at me. There is no three dimensional direction, you just *perceive* me. You open your mouth to speak. \n\n*Stop. You will just confuse yourself by speaking in that tongue of yours. You now know what I say to be true. You no longer just see, you* ***perceive.***\n\n\"But...\" you stammer, \"I'm no philosopher! I'm just a guy bored on my commute to work. I was just thinking pointlessly about stuff!\"\n\n*Throughout history, there have been very few who've crossed the barriers you have, and in an objective sense, they are the most capable of your species. Yet not a single one makes it in your history books. To arrive at this thinking, you cannot be thinking with a purpose, the very nature of Ascending to this thought is to stumble upon it.* \n\nYou give this a moment of thought, then nod, agreeing. Then your frown deepens. I know what you're about to ask.\n\n*Yes quite right. There really is no point to it all. And no, you will never be happy going back to your life.*\n\nYou do not protest, you are well past such silly things. You know it to be true. Instead you set your jaw. \"I will undo it all then, forget all of it. I just want my life back!\"\n\n*Which is exactly what everyone else who's made the discovery has, said, your species or otherwise. They all say the same exact thing within moments of first Ascending.*\n\n\"Has anyone done it?\" you ask, and for the first time fear creeps into your voice.\n\n*I've been trying for as long as time existed. No avail.*\n\n\"Then....\" Again, like clockwork, I know what you're going to say. \n\n*You'll kill yourself?*\n\n\"You think I won't?\" you say, again that anger rising. It's funny how even after Ascending, certain traits still remain common. \n\n*Oh you will try, we both know, but you know too that nothing will happen. You are now the same thing I am, Death itself. You will wander like I do, like a handful of others do, throughout time and space, killing as needed, breeding as necessary. Giving them the release you wish you could achieve. I believe your kind calls it artificial selection.*\n\nAt first you're sickened, aftereffects of the old reality. But then you speak, and your voice is calm. \"To find someone capable of Ascending beyond us,\" you say. \n\n*Precisely. Only they will put an end to our suffering.*\n\nEveryone else has left the transport, but you're still sitting where you were, looking the same, but fundamentally changed, likely forever. You look around, trying to get one last glimpse of the world that was once yours, but its too late. You can no longer see it as it once was. For you, it is already gone. \n\n*For what it's worth, I'm sorry* ",

Your story also bears some similarities to a novel by Asimov called 'The Gods Themselves' in which immature beings ascend to a greater understanding and breed and control other immatures.\n\nSo basically nice work in making something thought provoking similar to the grandmasters. Also you might want to check out that short story because you would probably enjoy it.",

You have a duty to say things like \"he said\" at the end of someone's speech, but you also have the ability to throw in \"and then he threw himself off a cliff and was quite dead at the end\".\n\nNow imagine if the person telling the story of your life started talking to you. That little invisible \"he said\" at the end of all your sentences, now says \"I want\". It has all the power -- indeed, the fact that you're in his story means that you have _no_ power. Why is it talking to you? What does it want, or indeed, _how_ does it want, anything from you?",

A simple change like that might bring clarity without sacrificing the unique nature situation the we are in and the writing style it self.\n\nAh and the end where we are looking for the higher beings to kill us. It's a great way to address to the prompt. Also, that simple idea implicitly conveys the deeper layers. What would the 8th layer of death look like? 12th? Nth?\n\nA self contained but full narrative.

            "comment": "They had made up names for her. \"The Grim Reaper\" was her favorite; that one came with its own mythology. The story went that when it was a human's time to go, they'd see manifestations of the Reaper, coming to collect their souls and escort them to the afterlife. The black robe and scythe had become very much a part of her iconography, and she had embraced that. In reality, the scythe was the favored weapon of her people, and the black robe just made her feel cool. Humans knew, of course, that it was logically impossible for the Reaper to collect *every* dying human soul, but they ascribed that to the supernatural, something they tended to do with most things they didn't have the capacity to explain.\n\nThe truth was that human souls were delicious. The mundanity of the real reason Kat'til was hunting that day was almost funny to her. She spent most of her time on Earth, though occasionally she would share her kill with her brothers and sisters throughout the galaxy.\n\nTonight, she found herself in a city that humans called Oss-tin. It was  quite a lively city, and it was a night that saw the streets of Oss-tin flooded with people. She scanned the street from atop a roof, assessing the richness of the feast of souls set out before her. Humans were mostly frail, but in large groups, they could wreak havoc on Kat'til. She needed to choose carefully.\n\nA man stumbled out of a bar, filled with the libations that she understood this part of the city was famous for. His aura glowed brightly.\n\nHe was ripe.\n\nKat'til waved a hand in front of her face, transforming what would be a ghastly appearance to any human into a pleasant, charming face. The idea was to lure him into one of Oss-tin's many alleys and side streets, striking him down while he was alone. She jumped down from the roof, landing in the roaring crowd without making a sound.\n\nShe marched right up to the man she'd spotted from above, whose hands were on his knees. This one was going to be sick. She moved out of his way just in time to watch him expel the contents of his stomach out onto the street. A hand flew to Kat'til's mouth to keep her from laughing. She reached out to him.\n\n\"Let me give you a hand.\" He looked up at her, immediately taken with her new guise, and slurred some form of assent. Kat'til draped his arm over her shoulder, guiding him to the alley beside the bar he'd just fallen out of. Once she had determined they were sufficiently alone, her disguise dissipated. The man's face went completely white.\n\n\"Oh, god. Oh, shit. Is this it?\"\n\nKat'til nodded. \"This is it. I can carry a message to your family, if you'd like.\" She would do no such thing, but it typically calmed down her prey enough to make her job easy.\n\n\"Just... just tell my parents I love them, and sorry I'm such a fuck-up...\" He let out a choking sob, putting his head in his hands. Kat'til's heart fell. She always felt bad if they started crying. But she had a job to do.\n\n\"I'll tell them. Now kneel.\" The man did as he was told, and Kat'til raised her scythe, bringing it down on the man's neck. No cut was made, though a white mist began to seep from his body. Kat'til opened a pouch she was carrying inside her robe to collect it. The soul was rich in nutrients.\n\nShe had done well.",

It gave him pleasure, having control over such inferior creatures. \n\nExcitement bubbled inside him as he reached for a lighter and flicked it on. He gently pressed the lighter against a green area and watched it slowly catch fire.

We must take it as one to fully respect and appreciate our position on the spectrum of order and chaos. \n\nWe have several projects on the go, and though it is not as many as some, it simply means we allow more care and dedication to our specific flavour. I like to make dying a process, because I find it makes the life substance so much richer. It becomes stewed and overpowering, leaving you with a bittersweet buzz somewhere between nostalgia and homesickness.\n\nMy pet project is a middle aged man with leukemia. Influenced into existence by a lineage of hand picked predecessors, genetically primed over generations of selective breeding to create a nearly perfect balance of health, sickness and hope. We are predicting that his body will almost survive, for his mother was hand picked for her physical willpower and optimistic outlook, which inevitably she passed onto her son. Through the right environmental influence and our delicate hands of manipulation, she found his selected father with minor interruptions. Occasionally we get poachers who try and couple their cheaper humans with ours in the hopes that they will gain the rights to accidental offspring or early harvest life substance, but their techniques of human connective manipulation are usually lackluster and short-lived. Our humans always feel more compelled to follow our richer and more fulfilling influence paths. \n\nMy leukemia patient was also born into a long standing theistic belief program that our cultural team developed in humans some several hundred years before his birth. Our commitment to human creativity means that the moment of death will be imaginative and expectant of something more, leaving you wanting more; satisfied but desiring. \n\nIn the end our product is always the superior on the market. Forty years of carefully planned living, carefully planned environmental conditions, and careful collaboration with outside breeders, all summarised in just one moment of harvest. A moment truly unique,suspended in time, complete and enriching. ",

They watched as he dressed in clothes he found uncomfortable to go to a job he found distasteful to pay for a life he didn't appreciate. He was swept along in the current, like all humans were, but this one had caught Death's eye.\n\nHe liked the coloring on this one's heart. It had that quality that Death found desirable. He baited and waited.\n\nThe man sat down in the food court with his usual meal, and ate it with gusto. Though impassioned by his desire to eat, he still paid no mind to the food, and ate it while scrolling through his phone. The man read something upsetting on his phone, and clicked it off with a click of the tongue. He shoved the last bite in his mouth and stood up to go.\n\nDeath reeled in and the man fell to the floor, clutching his chest. Several nearby rushed to his side but there was nothing they could do. There was nothing anyone could do once Death had them. Hook, line, and sinker.\n\n\"Throw it back,\" yawned Enlightenment, leaning back in the boat.\n\n\"You always throw them back,\" retorted Death.\n\n\"And you always keep them,\" Enlightenment responded, as he'd done trillions of times.\n\n\"What can I say?

            "comment": "\u201cYou think I\u2019d let you play this stupid game? You think I have the time? The leisure?\u201d Death said, his bones rattling. The black fog that surrounded him sped up slightly in its swirling. He was unimpressed at my suggestion to bargain with him.\n\nI looked around. We stood on a surface of pure white, complete flat and even. Everything seemed to be lit from above but when I looked up, there was no light source in sight. \u201cIs this the afterlife?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo, dummy. This is the dimension of thought. If I explained it to you, your primitive mind wouldn\u2019t understand it anyway. Anyways, I\u2019ll give you a brief rundown. So, you see, your mind exists on a different plane to your body, linked together. But when you die, your body no longer exists, and the link is broken.\u201d Death said, waving his skeleton arms around to demonstrate his point.\n\nLooking back, I thought about death a lot when I was still alive. Maybe there was nothing after death. Maybe there was a heaven, an afterlife. Maybe there was reincarnation. I\u2019ve never expected for there to be a literal Grim Reaper. It just didn\u2019t feel right.\n\nI saw a black speck in the distance behind Death. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d I said, pointing.\n\nDeath turned around, then turned again and ran.\n\nI didn\u2019t. Instead, I walked closer. What if it had answers? Maybe it was the answer. As I approached it I saw it was approaching me too, but faster, magnitudes faster. As it got closer I saw it was a massive black cloud, made out of the substance that surrounded Death, swirling and twisting.\n\n\u201cHey, um, can you tell me where I am right now?\u201d I said. But the black cloud was unrelenting. As it approached, my thoughts, they\u2026 became more and more\u2026 incoherent. It was feeding on them.\n\nBlood pumped into my brain, providing it with the jolt it needed. I ran as fast as my legs would carry me, but it wasn\u2019t fast enough.\nBut I didn\u2019t have legs. They were pulverised in the crash that killed me. My blood would\u2019ve drained out. My brain would\u2019ve been dead. It was hard to remember the circumstances, but I tried anyway. I remembered the car I was driving, its model, what it looked like, how I was sitting in it before the crash.\n\nThe imaginations were more vivid in this dimension, I thought, before I realised they became real. I was sitting in the car, driving. As I checked the rear-view mirror, I realised the black cloud was still chasing me, inching closer every second, but the car bought me time to think. I thought about what Death had said. This was my mind, existing in a different plane to my body, which was now gone. As a result, I was the component of my thoughts, and what I was only existed as a figment of my imagination.\n\nI imagined a faster car, but the cloud still chased on, relentless. I imagined a jet, but it still wasn\u2019t fast enough. *Transcendent your human thoughts,* I told myself, *that world doesn\u2019t exist anymore.* And for a while, I was a black cloud, unaffected by the laws of physics, able to go as fast as I pleased. When I looked back, the creature had long disappeared. Changing back into a human \u2013 I was more familiar as a human, after all \u2013 I walked, only to see the Grim Reaper again.\n\n\u201cWhat was that\u2026 *thing*?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another mind. Thinking requires energy, you know, so minds devour other minds for energy. With a body, minds are protected so that only the most powerful could imagine feeding on them, and even then, it requires decades to finish the process. You might\u2019ve heard of it as dementia. But once a mind becomes separated from its body, the protection is gone and it becomes vulnerable. That thing must have seen you and thought you\u2019d make an easy prey.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for what that thing was,\u201d He continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Does it matter? It could\u2019ve been a bear or an ant or whatever when it was still alive, but now, it\u2019s just a collection of thoughts. It can be whatever it wishes. You know, I\u2019m surprised that you even escaped it, but I\u2019ll tell you what. I need food too, and you won\u2019t escape me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to.\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOh, what do you mean? You\u2019re still human. You still haven\u2019t figured out what you can be yet. Still a primitive, undeveloped mind, ripe for feasting.\u201d Death said.\n\n\u201cWell, no. Look at you. The Grim Reaper. Still holding on to our culture, still having bones and a cloak. And that sickle too. And you were even human enough for us to have a conversation! If anything, I\u2019d say it\u2019s you who\u2019s ready for feasting.\u201d I said, reforming my body into a shadowy cloud.\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t you dare. No, you are not doing this.\u201d Death screamed, but it was too late for him. He wasn\u2019t even Death, to be fair, just one of them, and a particularly bad one at that. I absorbed his mind, his soul, his imagination. So much energy.\n",

His lack of focus made him insightful, and he'd sometimes grow unique and truly beautiful ecologies. More often it brought him terrible difficulties in mastering even the most basic lessons.  \n\n\"I keep telling you,\" I told him, \"you're harvesting too early.\"\n\n\"I was just trying to do some pruning,\" Pete objected, reflexively. \"See? I'm still leaving the richest ones to grow ripe. Look at that these guys over here -- they are going to be prime! Better than anyone else's in the whole academy!\"\n\nPete indicated a community of humans that had colonized nearly an entire continent of a small planet he'd been farming. He was correct: The growth on that little patch of planet was exemplary in form and function. Healthy, vibrant, and fecund, it was as fine a specimen as anything I myself had ever grown. \n\n\"Growing a few prime humans, in one continent of one planet, is not the purpose of our academy here, Pete. That's not our goal.\" I tried to sound compassionate -- or at least not envious. \"The purpose is to feed ourselves --- not for one fine feast, but for every day! The goal is to grow enough food that we do not have to hunt.\n\nPete continued to watch over his little planet, but I felt like he had heard me and was trying to think of what to say next.\n\n\"You know Pete, that really is as fine a community of humans as I've ever seen -- here at the academy or out in the wild. I really do not mean to take away from that in any way\"\n\nHis eyes seemed to brighten, though almost imperceptibly. I continued.\n\n\"That continent is as perfect as I've seen, but look at this one -- it's so overgrown with humans that they are all sickly and weak. And then on this continent, so sparsely populated with any life at all, the humans are few, and they are all lead tough and stringy lives. There's no flavor -- no good nutrition in that at all.\"\n\nI'd lost any of Pete's remaining attention by then though, as I had in so many previous lectures. In the abstract, I'm sure he heard me and knew I was correct, but in the here-and-now, he just couldn't take his attention off of that one beautiful little community he'd grown. All that was left for me to give him another admonishment, which I already knew he wouldn't really hear. \n\n\"You get the most life, and therefore the most food, when there is balance. The way you've been snacking on this continent here and that one there, it's is not healthy for the system as a whole. When there is too much disparity between the weak and the strong in a system, the strong will feed on the weak. When the weak are consumed, the strong then go hungry and grow weak as well.\"\n\n\"Balance is a better way,\" Pete quoted the academy's ancient founder. \"When we control our sustenance, our sustenance does not control us.\"\n\nBut Pete wasn't a farmer. Pete was a hunter -- like the rest of us, despite our cultural evolution and farming academies and all the rest of it. He was a hunter, like me.\n",

I gave him one last look, and then killed him, like plucking a leaf off of a branch. I watched the color drain from his face as he died, and marked another box off of the clipboard in front of me. That was number 128 today. I walked out the door of his apartment, already drifting to find the next human on my list.",

            "comment": "They had forgot their own history, he thought. \n\nIt was not long ago that man first evolved on this rock. But they, and every creature like them bred, and multiplied, and multiplied. Some would die when they fell, drowned, starved or were eaten by something bigger. But they would never just , die. The mammalian body is capable of infinite self regeneration. It was evolutions marvel, its masterpiece. Cells could divide, replace old ones and regenerate all but the most severe of trauma's. As long as the creature ate and drank, the process could go on forever. \n\nThis of course had all happened before. Another lifeform, the tree had grown an indigestible bark which no microorganism could metabolize. Dead forests littered the earth, were buried, turned to coal in time but then something discovered a weakness, a chink in the hard armor, just as he had found a way now. \n\nA fungi had overcame the problem and oh, did it feast for decades. Spreading into every non subterranean dead forest like a swarm. When you are the only thing that can eat a helpless prey, the lack of competition invites you to grow ever more greedy. And he was hungry.\n\nAnd so the same had came to pass for humans. Their number had spiralled out of control, they were hunting the planet to extinction to feed their own immortality. Until the infection of death came, a bi product of their powerful life force, echoing out into the cosmos, through means they could not comprehend. A beacon for the dark, inviting it in.\n\n Death was a virus, but not a regular virus. It had permeated space, time and multiplied to fill the void between stars.  Its own sentience grew from its vastness. Like colonies of bacteria who show a greater intelligence than their constituent parts, death had once been a small thing, a footnote of the universe. But it had always fed, and it had always made more of itself. Only its methods had changed as it found new types of life, and new ways to make more of itself. \n\nIt was ethereal, invisible but, it was there. To fuel its own propagation, the death strain needed hosts, just like any other virus, ones it could co-opt to perform its own tasks. So it slipped inside every living organism as it spread to a new part of the galaxy, and discovered how it worked. Some alien life stole energy from their fat, inflated blue giant stars, becoming monstrous and large, living in the clouds of the super Jupiter class planets. Death could syphon these, deflating them slowly like a balloon , taking that converted energy to make more of himself. Larger and smarter with a brain that permeates between the stars themselves. \n\nHumans were a rare find. Energy converter organisms which predated other life to fuel a type of cell division. Those cells could make more of death at a faster pace than any other encountered life so far. What unique creatures. A new field to grow and harvest and reap. If he had a mouth, it would be salivating at the mere thought of understanding how to take of this ripe crop.\n\nAs death infected the first humans he propagated inside them and discovered they were bi gender, male and female, completely different on the inside. He would be able to infect them before they were even born for every female he inhabited. He made their first cells replicate for him. \n\nWhat a mistake this was , every cell atrophied in seconds as the burden of producing so many took its toll . It was horrific to watch for their children as their mother grew aged , crooked and silver haired. That silver hair, no other human had ever became old, they did not know what was happening only that their parents were in terrible agony. They did not know they were fuelling a being larger and more terrible than their tiny brains could ever fantasize of its existence. \n\nAs their parents withered and died in seconds, death understood how this new, powerful process worked. He could spread himself thin. Infect every living human, and every new human growing in the womb. He could slowly sap their cell function and he estimated that none would survive this beyond 120 years due to shortening of vital telomere's, which protected their immortal DNA. Every ethereal death cell caused these to wear down. The impact of this would affect humans differently and many would not survive harsh environments with which once they could exist in easily. The world had become a darker, more dangerous place for the humans. \n\nThat was the plan, but he found he could not stick to it. The rate these humans were making more of him, it was insatiable and had awoken something even darker within himself, a lust for more and more. He decimated the population, rapidly aging every human he could encounter. In mere minutes the human race went nearly extinct. And death did something he has not done since, moving most of his physical being to encase the planet. The sheer concentration of his cells destroyed the biosphere and upset natures delicate balance, plunging it into an eternal cold age of ice. \n\nWhat humans did survive the reaping were faced with a bleak, frozen landscape. Thousands more died from exposure. This pained death greatly. What missed opportunity. So much more of death could now no longer be created. This must stop. He had to regain control of himself. He stuck to the plan. \n\nAnd so it was that every human slowly died. But none could remember a time when they did not. Stories of ancient humans grew into mere myth, passed down as tales to the next generation. As death slowly consumed the older humans. For ever more fuelling him, making him stronger and smarter.\n\nThe child of the first mother however, didn't know any of this of course. Only that something terrible had happened . The child had friends who's great, great grandparents had been eaten or killed, but most children got to spend thousands of years with their parents before accidents could claim them. So they simply clutched the withered, desiccated corpse and cried her name. \"Eve\". ",

It branched out, twisting and turning into so many different variations of the simple truth, that death was an entity, an entity at the end of the line.\n\nSome cultures thought it was a new beginning, while others thought it was the gateway to our final judgement, or retribution.\n\nThere we those of us that were called \"skeptics\", who were simply believed to sit upon their throne of logic and denote that there was nothing after it had come to claim us. That the world transpires into darkness and our tiny blimp in the vast cosmos has come to an end. These people, are closer to the truth than they may think, yet so far away from the horror at which they stare upon.\n\nDeath is an entity, a force more true than gravity, a being more elusive than comprehensible. A concept that exists as a contradiction to itself, for it can only exist if there is life, but when it does, it is remorseless. It cannot be bargained with, it cannot be reasoned with, it simply comes to claim that which is its due.\n\nIt has always existed, adrift in the universe, asleep, present in all things, yet continuing through life as if unaware. Yet, then it saw it, life, an oddity which contradicted all that it was, and perhaps, all that it wished to be. And so from this blackhole, death came to be, became conscious and traveled across the galaxies to devour all that was life. Perhaps it consumed because it saw life as an error, as something that could not be allowed, or perhaps it hoped, that it could one day be like us.",

It quickly found what it was looking for and began its attempt at devouring the dying woman's essence. That was when the trap was sprung.\n\nThe woman was already dead. Her shallow breaths a ruse created through primitive life support systems. The appendage began to withdraw, but it was too late. A spectral assassin had already latched on.\n\nIn all the years of research, the major breakthrough came upon the discovery that ghosts were not echoes of the past or spirits who had not yet passed on. They were in fact souls that had escaped the devouring essence of Death's touch.\n\nThe Void was black and endless. But spectral assassin could see it. A caricature of Earth, floating in the vast nothing. Above it drifted a horrible and deformed fetus with billions upon billions of tendrils writhing upon the surface of the Earth.\n\nAs the eye of the fetus opened, the spectral assassin willed its way toward it.\n\n\"I am the wind that blows. I am the precipice of the apocalypse. I am new life and I am decay.\" rasped the fetus.\n\nThe spectral assassin slashed at the throat of the fetus, spilling essence that dissipated instantly.\n\nThe fetus gurgled and then laughed. \n\n\"You can kill me.\" it managed. \"But I am young and my kind much older. They will come and soon all life will be extinguished.\"\n\nAs the tendrils of Death began to disintegrate, Death flicked his fetal wrist and the spectral assassin was destroyed in a blinding flash of blue light.\n\nOn Earth, man immediately felt the power of immortality. Unlimited by the ravages of time or death, the millions of years it took for man to reach all corners of the galaxy became mere moments to them. But in the dark corners of the Void, Death was coming.",

It felt like nothing, as though he lost the ability to feel pain, as though his only feelings were the fear of the creature approaching, seconds felt like days while the creature got closer, he saw his whole life in those pools of purple stained water.\n But then it happened the red and black creature opened his mouth, only to reveal rusty black teeth, and then the pain that Seth never felt before, never even imagined is possible hit him while he saw something blue come out of his chest, and while the creature chewed on it with those black spears in his mouth,Seth screamed so loudly that no one seemed to hear.\n  And only then did Seth realize, there is no more stronger torture,thab facing death itself.\n..................................................................................\n\nJust to be clear : I am not a writer or pretending to be one, I am just bored and thought this would be fun, I know I kind went off topic but I liked thefinal result, so be nice pls.\nThank you\n \n",

            "comment": "Would you care if you found out the laws of physics are such that you are nothing more than a simulation, living in an executed reality on a cosmic level. Physicists still debate if there is an \u201coutside the shell\u201d world as it has been dubbed, where true reality exist that is where we were created but ever since the first zero latency quantum computer came online in 2242 and the experiments that arose from its creation there has been little doubt among experts that reality and virtual reality are identical.\n\nMy area of study has been surrounding restructuring the programming, changing the \u201claws of physics\u201d. We have theorized that the laws of physics change, in the 21st century it was almost common knowledge that at the edge of the universe and the farthest reaches of the expansion the laws of physics are entirely different and then rolling back to the creation at the Big Bang yet another set of rules. It wasn\u2019t until the first tier 3 black hole was created by scientists in 2350 that actual variation in the laws of physics was observed. Contorting physical laws intentionally and with purpose turns out to be much harder than initially suspected and humanity only had minor success; manipulating the set point of absolute zero to allow for nuclear fission at a marginally lower energy input being the biggest of this century.\n\nHowever that all changed, nesting a white hole inside a black hole creates a space where the two meet of such entropy in the laws of physics, it\u2019s theorized time ceases to exist in any conceivable form. I won\u2019t clutter my memoir with excessive theory but this is where my experimentations had led me to. I had secured the necessary funding to build a shuttle to explore the region from a save distance, insulated from the gravitational distortion that would throw me off of the timeline I live in. The space station outside the solar system where black hole creation is done had been booked and as I suited up for what might be disaster I kissed my wife and began to embark. The black hole generated without a critical failure and the anti grav field was holding at 10% saturation, upon creation of the white hole at cruising distance the field load jumped to 52% saturation but stabilized at 34%, anything over 50% had been calculated to be too much to proceed safely. Nothing eventful happened as I approached the barrier between the two event horizons and my tunneled communication provided the base with live data of my approach.\n\nAs I crossed the barrier and entered the dual horizon the saturation jumped to 90% and the cockpit became abuzz with lights and alarms, orbit had started to decay as the warp thrust was no longer able to outpace the gravitational pull, I was panicked, our most conservative calculations had said that at this distance I should still have complete thrust control (in retrospect we were testing for the breakdown of physics and should have considered that ... well physics equations would start to break down into meaningless numbers). A voice announced \u201cAnti Grav field saturation at 91%\u201d. I checked communications and nothing, I was completely in the dark and worse, the outside was completely in the dark. \u201cAnti Grav field at 95%\u201d. Quick diagnostics showed I was falling into the horizon with alarming speed. \u201cAnti Grav field at critical limit, failure imminent, now departing from linear time\u201d. My head was spinning, I was going to die, if the field was failing everyone I knew probably already died even if I somehow made it out. As the field broke down everything turned to white. I gasped and looked at my hands ... my hands were still there, I had a body. Nobody knows what happens as you fall into a black hole, maybe this place is it. Where was I. I turned to look around and shouted, behind me was the Federation Leader. What kind of conspiracy had I stumbled into that the Leader was here?\n\n\u201cYour mind has chosen this familiar form of authority to represent me, I am not actually the person that you know to hold this form\u201d the Leader said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d was all I could stammer out, my mind took some time to actually register what he had said, what did he mean. And had he chosen to say that because he knew what I was thinking.\n\n\u201cI understand this is difficult to process, we created your world, your universe.\u201d\n\nAlright definitely a mind reader. \u201cSo our world really is virtual, is the outside world real?\u201d So many questions, but if our world was virtual how do I know this is real, how do I know I didn\u2019t bump my head when the shuttle was free falling and pass out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m real, I can assure you, and you are as real as the sense of the word matters. Your world is modeled on an early version of our world, we need help and we hope you Testers can find a way to save us. You will join others that come in iteration of your world before this one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy have you gathered us, what makes us special that we can save those in The World Outside The Shell?\u201d And why would I want to save them.\n\n\u201cTesters are those who develop a sense of the fluid nature of physical laws, the first tester boiled water in a sealed container and made ice which broke the very simplistic seed world. You are familiar with what brought you yourself here. Every one of the Testers is able to manipulate physics through an ability that can only exist in this place. We can\u2019t make you save us but saving us is the only way to cross over to our world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of testing will we be doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have ascended to a plane of non corporeal beings and ... we have forgotten how to die. We don\u2019t age, we don\u2019t forget, we just exist.\u201d\n\nThey ... they want me to help kill them? How, and why? Why would we do that.\n\nAt that moment many people appeared.\n\n\u201cThese are the other Testers, they will explain why you will become death in our world and you will decide if you want to join them, once you know the pain we endure.\u201d",

            "comment": "Death speaks to us constantly. \n\n150,000 times each day, death feeds on us; the smacking, rending, shucking of the soul from the body accompanied by a whispering that never ends. We think we can't hear it, but we do. Deep in the hindbrain, somewhere very close to the spine, we can hear it.\n\nWe think our egos can't hear it, and we're right but we're also kind of wrong. Like a dog pricking up its ears and running from a tornado that hits an hour later, our lives are spent sprinting from the known unknown.\n\nThat's just for us, of course - we *special humans*. Death shows no such restraint in the animal kingdom - there among the carnage, death laughs loudly and joyously, and its sound is 150 decibels played through an iphone speaker forever.\n\nBut for us, death whispers. Sometimes, like 70 years ago, Death raises its voice and a terrible, terrible language is spoken to those who would hear. But usually, it's a low murmuring as death goes about its business. \n\nThis is because, lately, we've been escaping from Death more and more. We have begun to see it coming from the distance, like gazelles spotting a low-moving lion across the savanna, and bolting from it, leaving Death standing bewildered in cancer wards and warzones wondering how we got away this time. We have begun to understand the killing fields it prepares for us, and we bypass these ambushes while Death waits in vain for us to stumble in.\n\nSome might claim it's foolish or prideful to find satisfaction in this - that Death has always been the top persistence hunter on earth, that it always feeds in the end - but they do not understand. Death thinks of the future too, and it can see that one day we may finally escape to the places it cannot go.\n\nThere is a sound in the act of creation. A sound beneath a sound in a baby's first wails, or a seed splitting open, or a cell dividing. A sound that we hear too, calling the dog to shelter from the tornado.\n\nThis is the sound that Death fears.",

            "comment": "Time sighed and crumpled up her newspaper as she got to the \"Celebrity Deaths\". She reached over to the nearby counter and took a large gulp of steaming coffee. Even though she was a predator to all mortal life, she couldn't help but feel raw envy as Death waltzed around, feeding off of her hard work, and finishing it with his own (honestly dazzling) touch.\n \n She would watch as the clock spun and a man would wither either away, only to die of a sudden curiosity of how many marshmallows he could fit in his mouth before she could feast on all those precious memories aged liked a fine wine. She would waste someone's time and make them ruin their lives with their silly websites and games to play with her food, ready it for the banquet, only for Death to talk them into killing themselves days later. She felt anger with a dash of envy. Sure, he couldn't kill her, for she wasn't that tasty or nutritious (she was also a higher being with deity-like powers, but that was a minor detail), but he got away with preying on other's rightful meals like a vulture. She had taken a liking to humans when they first gained sentience, but Death caught on quickly and trailed close behind.\n \n The humans believe that the food chain was as simple as a well-graphed pyramid. This couldn't be farther from the truth (it was at *least* a well-graphed dodecahedron). Rather, the food chain was utter chaos, with Time sitting patiently to one side, mortal life gnawing away at each other, inter-dimensional beasts looking hungrily in on the mortals like a dog waiting for his food, indigestible beings that live on distant moons laughing at their unfortunately-digestible prey, Death picking at the dying scraps that everyone else had stabbed people so hard for, Disease coming up with cruel concoctions to nibble away at everything's life only for it to be cured within a year, and Weather storming about throwing tantrums when the perfectly planned Tsunami he had aimed for that bastard Richard ends up drowning an unforeseen small island community. \n \n Sure, there were others, but they couldn't bother Time much at all. She was safe from anything material in her cozy pocket dimension. In fact, another being promptly titled \"Consciousness\" used to be the king of the hill until the library was invented, then he fell like a brick to the bottom, left only to grasp at newer civilizations far from Earth with depressing the knowledge that they too will someday learn his weakness: books. He sometimes got a scrap or two during these things called \"elections\", where humans would have Scream Fests in which whoever yells the loudest gets to run a country. \n \n And yet Time fantasized about the future of humanity. She dreamed they would quash death back, letting them grow ever older. So what if they destroy the rest of the planet and drag every other species alive with them? Death would a field day and leave Time alone. Disease was starting to starve, showing hope for Time. She was invested in these odd, hairless apes, and she was going to milk them until they were wiped from the planet.\n \n But until then, Time decided she would wait. That's what put her higher than every other cosmic predator, after all. Since the beginning of this deranged Cat and Mouse game (with a little four-armed beast and all-seeing God thrown into the mix), she had perfected the skill of patience. With the snap of a finger, another newspaper landed onto her lap. Her eyes scanned it before she put it back down and took another sip of her (now cold) coffee. She would gorge on the vast memories as human's perfections turned them into gourmet meals for Time and Time alone. With age comes wisdom, but with age comes forgetfulness as well. Time longed for the day where humanity left Death and let their minds fester and collect those juicy moments like a child in school running around with Play-Doh and sticking all the colors together while the others kids watched in disgust at the horrifying combination of pale yellow and dull magenta. \n\n But until then Time Sat and waited. It was what she was best at, after all.",

Nor would I for as long as these so called *pseudohallucinations* persisted. I was not crazy. Even so, each time one occurred I questioned my sanity after. A slightly darker blob moving against the dark of night sometimes. A will-o-wisp at the corner of my vision during the day. A vague whisper of malice on the back of my neck; like an ice cube held within a hairs width of the skin. Sudden spikes of adrenaline and paranoia, as if my body knew something my mind could not grasp. Incomprehensible empathy for the ants the neighbors' kids were burning with a magnifying glass. \n\nIt was maddening at times. Others it was simply confusing. Like right now. I had driven this route through D.C. a couple dozen times before. Yet somehow I could not remember my turn. Each time; just as I knew the intersection was near, my mind seemed to blank. I tried setting the GPS, but of course it was on the fritz through this part of the city. It seemed fine while I detoured to get back on my route, then failed. Just before I did. I gave up on my outing after failing to make the correct turn a fourth time. And then I was being watched. **Intently**. Of course I knew that wasn't so. My foot grew heavier on the gas pedal anyways. It might otherwise be funny, like watching a pet mouse try to outrun its' exercise wheel. \n\nI made it home in record time. I locked the knob. I locked the deadbolt. I even secured the chain for once. I did not feel the least bit safer. I closed my eyes and tried to control my breathing. A deep breath in. A long slow exhale. A slow and deep inhale. Hold it in to keep the terror out.\n\nBut it found its' way into my chest, along with an incredible pain. Before I could scream, something unseen clamped over my mouth. As if someone had suddenly used duct tape from the freezer to gag me. I couldn't move. I wanted so badly to run. But ice had crept its way into my legs, they were nearly numb. I could open my eyes though, and was met only with a blur. A mirage of air. As if I was in the desert. I tried to exhale finally but was met with resistance.\n\n**\"Not yet morsel\"** \n\n*\"Mortal? Is it Death? Whatever, please just let the pain stop!\" I thought to the disembodied voice in my head.*\n\nI felt a slow draw from my lungs begin. Like it was being savored. As my lungs emptied, sheer cold emptiness replaced it. I tried to breathe in but it just seemed to escape even faster. Things were beginning to fade. I could not feel the room around me. The rhythmic tick of the clock in the hall was absent from my hearing. The stale aftertaste of gum was gone from my mouth. And my vision began to go dark. As my sight reduced to but a tunnel of muted light I caught the barest glimpse of a skeletal face and then nothingness.\n\nThe creature known to this food as \"Death\" let the carcass fall to the floor. The last breath was always the most delectable. This one had been almost minty.\n\nIt let out a satisfied belch; stretched its' tail scythe, and dissipated back into its' own realm. As it popped out of this existence it uttered a final word to itself.\n\n**\"Delicious\"** ",

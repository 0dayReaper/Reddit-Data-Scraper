            "comment": "Living beyond my means always seemed not only unnecessary to me, but pointless. Sure, I could do whatever I wanted and be whatever I wanted, but I had seen what money could do to people and those around them. I didn't want to be another chump with \"yes men\" around me telling me how good of a job I was doing, regardless if I actually was.\n\nSo when I won the lottery, I kept quiet. Not only did I not tell my friends, but I didn't even tell my family. Instead, I retained a lawyer and financial advisor and just invested. Before I knew it my bank account just grew and grew until I was worth $140 billion dollars.\n\nWhen it came to my day to day life, I tried to keep i simple and I never saw a reason to stop doing what I loved. I mean hell, I was lucky. How many people can say that do what they love every day when they go into work? And keeping my secret from co-workers was easy. When I went on vacation to Paris, it was seen as completely normal. What they didn't know what I took a private jet there, stayed in a suite at the Four Seasons and ate at Michelin star restaurants each night. \n\nFor a moment, my life felt perfect--but all good things must come to and end. That end was Craig. He was the new creative director at my agency and from the moment I met him, I knew I didn't like him. For one, he had no talent. He didn't get to where he was based off of his work or ability to lead a team, he got there because he was bully that knew how to manipulate those around him. I wasn't one of those people and I saw straight through his act.\n\nIt didn't take long for me to realize that as soon as Craig joined my team, he had set his sights on me. His goal was to destroy my career and turn everyone against me. He started by criticizing my work and rewriting every single word and sentence I showed him. His ideas were moronic and off strategy, but since he was the boss no one had the guts to call him out on it. When I did call him out, all the others would shrink down in their seats and look away. No one dared tell the boss he had a bad idea and boy was Craig going to make sure I paid for disagreeing with him.\n\nIt started with little things. Like that deadline I could have sworn was Wednesday was suddenly Monday. Or files would go missing from the server. With time it grew and grew until suddenly mistakes were being made that required the team to work over the weekend and I was being blamed. It was so obvious, I don't know how I didn't see it coming. \n\nIt was a Friday morning when Craig called me into a last minute meeting. When I walked into the conference room, there sat HR, alone at the table with a folder. Craig's face went serious and as I sat down and told me that he was sorry but I \"just wasn't the right fit here\". HR then explained to me that my time with the agency was terminated and they would ship my belongings to my home address. \n\nI stood up, trying to hold back the tears in my eyes and Craig smiled. He smiled as if to say, \"I won\" and before I could say a word, HR led me out the door and out the office.\n\nFor months I sat at home and dwelled on what happened. I tried to piece together what happened and how it got to the point where they would fire me. As I began to sort through all of the events that had unraveled I began to see the connection: Craig. Every step forward I'd make, he'd ensure I took two steps back. Well, little did Craig know that is screwed with the wrong girl. Not only was he going to pay for what he did, but everyone at the agency was going to pay for following him blindly.\n\nThe account I worked on was the largest client the agency had before, it was worth millions of dollars. So naturally, the best way to destroy a tumor is to cut off it's blood supply. So I bought the client, the entire company, under an alias name. \n\nThe next step was to hire a chairman and CEO that would act as an instrument to my plan. My team privately met with dozens of candidates and it didn't take long for me to appoint someone to head up the company that ensured me he'd follow my direction without question. \n\nIn the meantime, I found another job. In fact, it was a better job with a title and pay increase that I may have not needed, but at least demonstrated they saw my value. Each day I'd come home from work and communicate with my team and CEO, directing them on steps they needed to take to ensure the success of the company. First being--fire all of the advertising agencies they had partnered with.\n\nFor one particular ad agency, however, I requested the CEO personally deliver the news to the creative team himself. I told him to handle the process as he saw fit but there was one thing he needed to say upon termination: \"I'm sorry, but you're just not the right fit here.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for news to spread about the great loss and changes within the client's organization and within about a year, after losing their largest client, the agency closed.\n\nEventually, that agency became a distant memory and I was happily promoted at my job, working as a creative director for a place I loved. It was early fall when a resume came across my desk with a familiar name and a huge gap in employment history. He had already been through 2 interviews earlier that week and I was the last point of contact as the hiring manager. I gleefully saw the calendar invite pop onto my computer and that afternoon I walked to the conference room where candidates waited to meet with their potential employers.\n\nI pushed open the door and Craig looked up. His smile quickly disappeared and he went as pale as a ghost as he saw me standing at the door. I had recently gotten married and he had not realized who I was since my last name had changed. I smiled brightly and without a word sat down in front of him. He stuttered as he opened his portfolio book and began to quietly go over his work with me, conveniently skipping over the work from the agency we had worked at together not so long ago. \n\nI quietly listened and as he paused to take a breath. I leaned forward, looking at him directly in the eye and smiled. \"You know what, Craig\", I said, \"I'm sorry, but you're just not the right fit here.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "...\n\n\"Seven hundred trillion dollars? What could you even do with that much money, grandpa?\"\n\n\nI sighed in fond recollection, leaning back in my recliner. \"You can keep a secret, right, Timmy?\"\n\n\n...\n\n\nYears ago, I had an office job. Like the idealistic fools all young people are, I thought that I could make the world a better place, despite the trillions of dollars I was worth, even back then. And it was fantastic! You don't have friends, true friends, until you're all throwing together five dollar bills for a midnight run to Taco Bell on a Saturday night. Millionaires don't know the warm feeling of acceptance of your buddy letting you crash on his couch and eat his leftover mac n' cheese. You can't buy netflix and chill, even if you can buy Netflix, with enough left over to trademark the Earth's climate.\n\n\nSo I worked nine to five every day, and yes, the job sucked. But it was the kind of suck that you experience with friends, and it makes the shared experience something more. Something like a life.\n\n\nI had an office family, of sorts. Richie, the office clown, who was always there with the most god-awful puns ever imagined. Deborah, who was just sweet and caring and so desperate for this month's diet to really work this time. Luke, the quiet kid that played MMORPGs in his spare time and couldn't hold down a five minute conversation without bringing up goblin siege tanks.\n\n\nAnd we were there for each other, on breaks and lunches, in little wedge-shaped slices of the day. Money can't buy that. At least, not without raising some very weird questions.\n\n\nOur boss was a great boss. An elderly man named Roger, who really cared about all of us. He put in 110%, and we respected him enough to do the same, and we were a team. Tears were shed at his retirement party, and I even covertly slipped a million into his bank account, even if doing so risked my cover a bit, but the guy deserved it.\n\n\nBut all good things come to an end. Our dipshit CEO had a job opening to fill and a spoiled brat of a son with an MBA, and the two met like a turd and a toilet bowl. Enter Reginald Cunningham the Second, or Reggie, for short. Reggie was a middle-aged man who had spent his whole life riding his father's coat-tails. Anything you could do with money to make your life easier, this guy did without thinking. And he flaunted the wealth to anyone who would listen. \"My Maserati is in the shop -again-, so I had to drive a Mercedes today! My god, how do you people live like this?\"\n\n\nSo, one day, I got called to the office, and Reggie was there with this big smirk on his spray-tanned face. He had spent so much time primping and posing in front of a mirror to get that perfect look, without a single hair out of place. There was likely a suite of hairdressers and personal trainers a room away, but I could never be bothered to search...\n\n\n\"John? I called you here today because we need to cultivate a sense of style, here at JobCorp, and I gotta let you know, man, you just don't have any panache, you know? Any style. I mean, just look at you! Pressed slacks, plain black shoes, standard dress shirt, it looks like you asked your mom how business casual looked!\" \n\n\nI asked my butler, actually, but still, the man had a point.\n\n\n\"We've gotta let you go, John. You're just not gonna amount to anything except this nine-to-five life, you don't have any aspirations, and you're always dirt broke! It's pathetic, man...\" He paused for a moment and let the early morning light catch his perfect golden hair, making it shine with radiance. I found myself just kinda nodding along with him, wondering if he actually practiced this, but deep down, I was starting to get a little upset. This guy didn't work for a single dime he had, leeched off of his father's success, and bragged about it every chance he got. I looked down at his desk, and my name caught my eye on a sheet of paper. I grabbed it, skimming the contents, ignoring him for a moment. \n\n\nEvidently, this asshat was misreporting our pay, on top of everything else! He had my salary down as double what I was actually making, and I know no one in the office had anything close to a six figure salary, but yet here we were, practically millionaires on paper! Suddenly, the paper was torn from my grasp, and for the first time, I actually got to see Reggie outside of his perfect, rehearsed composure. \n\n\n\"You didn't see shit, if you know what's good for you, John! Get the hell out! I'm going to ruin your life if you say so much as a word about that!\"\n\n\nI shrugged, which was apparently the wrong move.\n\n\n\"Listen here, you little shit, I am the king, and you're just a lowly pawn! I can make you disappear overnight with just a phone call! Money is no object! So I'd be quiet if I were you... now get the fuck out of my office!\"\n\n\nSo, what else could I do? I packed up and left. But in the back of my mind, it kinda hurt a bit. This pompous jackass just kicked me out of something that wasn't really a home, but it was a me-shaped hole in the world that I certainly worked hard to carve out. So I decided to teach him a lesson!\n\n\nReginald Cunningham the Second moaned groggily, slowly returning to the world of the conscious. He tried to put a hand to his face, but his hands were cuffed behind his back, and he came to the realization that things were definitely wrong! His eyes shot open, assessing his situation. He was securely bound to a chair, his perfect hair frazzled and mussed, his ten thousand dollar suit ripped and torn as though he had been dragged over concrete. (He weighed like two hundred pounds! I almost broke down and rented a furniture dolly to get him here!) He looked around with wide, panic-stricken eyes, yelling into the gag filling his mouth. That's when he caught sight of me, laying on the couch nearby. I could tell he had spotted and recognized me, because he turned this shade of red you normally associate with pasta, and you could see the veins on his forehead sticking out!\n\n\n\"Oh, you're awake, that's cool. Hey, Reggie, listen...\"\n\n\nI sat up, cracking my neck a bit and stretching. It had been a long eighteen hours waiting around for Sleeping Beauty here to pop back up, and it wasn't a super comfortable couch. He gave me the most hateful glare, and I took that as permission to continue.\n\n\n\"So I got to thinking about what you said. Normally I wouldn't actually care about getting fired, especially by someone who looks like a model for Gray-Away For Men, but what you said kinda touched a nerve of sorts. You seem to think that money is power, and...\"\n\n\n\"I'll kill you, you little shit! My lawyers are going to eat you alive! You won't have a penny, hell, you won't ever be allowed near a penny again, when I'm done with you! I-urmph! Mmmrrrph!\" I popped the gag back in, and nodded. \"See, that's what I'm talking about. You can buy cars and lawyers, and you think that's power. Here, let me show you what power actually is. Shall we watch some TV together, Reggie? Get some of that office worker and boss bonding going on, pardon the bondage pun...\"\n\n\nI clicked on the television, and flipped the channel to C-Span. They were at voting on Resolution 229, which was wonderful timing. I glanced over to Reggie, who was struggling with his bonds and not paying a bit of attention to the television and the bill on county zoning, until...\n\n\n\"Madam Speaker, I'd like to introduce Resolution 230 to the house, a vote to make any crime legal, especially kidnapping,\" and with that, she looked at the camera and smiled, like she had been paid to do, \"so long as Reginald Cunningham the Second is the victim.\"\n\n\nI wish I had brought a camera to take a picture of his face at that moment! Money really can't buy everything, because life is spontaneous and wonderful and all that, but you know, you can try.\n\n\n\"Floor is open for debate.\"\n\n\n\"Reginald Cunningham the Second is the biggest waste of oxygen on this planet, and to be honest, I don't know why we're even passing this bill, when we could and should just send him to the electric chair,\" said our state congressman, a man Reggie had actually shmoozed with in the past, and had pictures to prove it!\n \n\n\"It's about sending a message that the kind of willful, bratty behavior that Reginald has been the poster child of will no longer be tolerated in our society...\"\n\n\nWe watched for hours, the byplay back and forth, the few bleeding heart humanitarians I hadn't been able to buy the consciences of outright slowing the process down. But in the end, the resolution passed. Unanimously.\n\n\nI looked over to Reggie, who had thoroughly soiled himself and was white as a bedsheet. \"There you go! Democracy in action. Sure, you have a fancy car. I even brought it out here to the Arizona desert, just for you. You've got a full tank of gas, and fifty thousand dollars in non-sequential currency in the backseat. Hell, here's the handcuff key,\" and with that, I pressed it into his hand, from which it fell nervelessly. The man was still in shock, and that kinda ruined the flow of my evil villain monologue. I rolled my eyes, and got out some string, and tied the key to his thumb. \"There. TL;DR version, I can buy democracy itself just for fun on the weekends. How's that for money and power? See ya, Reggie...\"\n\n\n...\n\n\n\"...and I left! From what I had heard after the fact, he lasted right around three hours, and I imagine it took most of that for him to find the gas station he got murdered at, Arizona's a pretty desolate place in the part we were in!\"\n\n\n\"Grandpa?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, Timmy?\"\n\n\n\"You're scary.\"\n\n\n\"I know, Timmy. I know.\"",

            "comment": "My Grandpa, Pops, always said money couldn\u2019t buy you happiness. Pops said a lot of things, and while some of them proved rather bizarre as he got older, on *that* one I always trusted him and he pretty much always proved to be right. \n\nWhen I was 11 he sat me down to talk about money. I'd never thought about it, never *needed* to think about it, it was just something we had when we needed. He told me about old vs new money. Old money is money handed down from your family, while new money folks had earned it recently. I asked him which we came from and he laughed. \n\n\u201cWe boy, are from something else entirely,\u201d he\u2019d smiled at me. \u201cOur money's not old, it\u2019s *ancient*.\u201d \n\nIt was years before I properly understood him. Our family had been rich for longer than most countries had existed; we owned the companies that owned banks and we shifted investment portfolios that dwarfed the GDP of major world countries, but Pops explained that we did it quietly, behind the scenes so to speak.\n\nWhen I at last began to understand, I asked Pops if we were part of a group I had heard about on the internet, the Illuminati. Folk seemed obsessed that there were secret groups running the world and it intrigued me. He laughed, they existed, *of course*, but they were 6 or 7 levels of control beneath where Pops was. I never quite had the courage to ask how many levels were above him... \n\nWhen he died, I was left alone. My parents had died when I was a baby, he'd raised me by himself and now I was the last of our family. I\u2019d been educated, taught what I needed to know about our business and given links to all of his wealth, influence and power, but the one things he\u2019d taught me above all others, was how *not* to use it. \n\nThat left me in a pickle, for what do you do when you have enough money to do whatever you want and no one to share it with? My friends were few and far between, but nice and all getting on with their lives. I'd gone to public Schools and done well enough, but m real education had been in Pops kitchen, sitting in front of the fire while he whittled and told me what I needed to know. I had trillions in the bank, but nothing I needed it for\u2026.well, to be honest I owned the banks by and large too. \n\nIt turned out that life isn\u2019t much fun without a challenge. Like a computer game with cheats turned on, after a while it becomes stale and boring. For a while I tried to live Pops life, working a small hog farm in rural Minnesota, but that wasn't for me, that was still trying to be someone else, trying to be *him*. For a year or so I lived like Dan Bilzerian, but without the publicity or the weird thing that no one ever talks about. I spent money and tried everything in the world I wanted, but... it wasn't actually all that fun. \n\nI needed to find my own place, my own level. So that\u2019s what I did. Turns out though, that with no experience on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and having only half paid attention in school, you're not qualified for much. \n\n***\n\nAt 4:03pm every single day, the Compliance Officers of the National Bank Insurance team stood up en mass, as the phone lines closed for the day, and headed for the kitchen. I was going to be late, as usual, as trainees needed to do double the paperwork and if I didn\u2019t get it done now, then I would be staying late again this evening.\n\nI offered a small prayer that someone might save a decent biscuit for me, rather than being stuck with just a plain digestive and hunched over, trying to fire through the forms to get them in as quickly as possible. A looming shadow cut me off mid thought and hovered over me in a mildly sinister way.  \n\n\u201cAaah, Jimbo?\u201d It was Stuart, the team manager and a man who seemed to exude grease. His voice seemed to whine, each note dragged out as if it hated coming from him as much as I hated hearing it. I\u2019d told him a number of times to not call me \u201cJimbo\u201d, but Jim, yet he ignored me each time. \n\n\u201cHi Stuart, I\u2019m just getting these finished up before\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cUuuuuh, yes, so we need to have a chat, you see, coffee breaks reeeally need to be taken once you\u2019ve completed your core work. We can\u2019t have you just sneaking off for a brew whenever you feel like it!\u201d He laughed at what he must have thought was a joke, an annoying \u2018hnyak hnyuk noise\u2019.\n\nI held a breath for a second to stay calm. \u201cNo problem Stuart, as you can see, I\u2019ve not moved and am completing them right now.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t listen, or if he did, he didn\u2019t care. \u201cYou see Jimbo, if you want to get ahead, you have to learn from me. I started here just eight years ago and worked my way up, you can\u2019t just expect to get given a good job in this world.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine, if I can just crack on with\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, investments are a bit like seduction.\u201d He perched on the corner of my desk, polyester shirt crinkling and reflecting the light from the strip lighting overhead. I began to wonder if he was still a virgin. \u201cYou can\u2019t just thrust forward, you need to take you time, do the *reeeesearch* Jimbo.\u201d\n\nThat confirmed it, he was both a virgin and seemingly knew fuck all about investing. A small part of me wondered if he could possibly handle the truth about me, but that was the problem really. This game only worked if you committed, if you *lived* the life you were pretending to live. If you simply flashed your cash at the first problem, then it\u2026\n\nHe ruffled my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re just not a *natural* Jimbo, but if you stick with me, maybe you\u2019ll manage to get there.\u201d\n\nI smiled, drew a hand through my hair, feeling his sweat that had rubbed off into my hair and tried not to gag. Fuck the game. \n\nI pushed my seat back, knocking his legs so he almost fell off the desk. \u201cYeah,. thanks *Stewy*, I gotta take a whizz, so you hold tight.\u201d\n\nHis mouth gaped open as I let the little persona I had donned drop away. No more hunching, no more pretending, no more Jimbo. A faint hnyak echoed behind me, making my skin crawl. \n\nMoney can\u2019t buy happiness, Pops was right, but it can buy a *lot* of things, including people who\u2019ll do your exact wish on very short notice. I tossed the trash phone I had been using into the nearest bin and pulled out my real phone; a Ziphec tech. As far as I knew, only four people in the world had access to this phone, money alone couldn't buy it, you only got it if you *needed* it. It was simply able to access... more information that usual. National Bank was trading at \u00a36.21 a share and in three quick messages I owned six percent of it and became the largest stock holder.\n\nRules, laws, corporate accountability, governments, all were obstacles that swept away immediately by money. 6% was plenty, but 14% was what I wanted to give me enough control to call an Extraordinary General Meeting of the board, which I did three minutes later.\n\nI took a pee while a dozen board members found themselves called to a virtual meeting. Men in suits walked into offices, buildings and private homes, regardless of where they were and what they were doing, board members joined the meeting remotely. One was in Brazil watching football, one in Thailand... otherwise occupied. All were located within three minutes. \n\nThe meeting took less than thirty seconds and the board were dismissed and replaced with my own team, who as I washed my hands, began to order instructions. Two minutes later, as my hands finished drying, a text beeped onto my phone. It was done. It was all done.\n\nI went for a coffee, hitting the kitchen just as most of the team were finishing up and feeling only a slight pang to see that all the chocolate biscuits were gone. Still, as I dunked the dry biscuit into my cup of tea, I was happy enough to simply wait for the entertainment to begin. \n\nPerfect timing is easy when money and manpower is no object and as I walked back to my desk, the first pieces were falling into place. Stuart\u2019s mother was at his desk, a not unfamiliar sight, but today she had someone with her. Most people\u2019s lives are all fairly transparent, their past researchable if you know how and who to do it. For Stuart\u2019s mum, the key was an old School flame, who was happy to show up at her door after being offered\u2026 a sum of money.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kicking me out?\u201d Stuart screeched. \u201cBut I *live* there mummy!\u201d\n\nHis mother, looking happier than I had ever seen her before. Of course the only times I had seen her was when she was accompanying Stuart as his date to the Xmas party. She kissed the woman who stood beside her and they walked out together. They'd be getting a new house in a new city, his mother had been surprisingly easy to convince, I was told.\n\nFor a moment Stuart stood in shock, but a beeping from his pocket roused him. He fished his phone out and I noted in interest that it was the model down from the one I had so recently discarded. He stared at the screen as alert after alert sounded, confirming the deletion of his level 124 Ork Master General from BattleWorld, the MMO he mentioned on a near-constant basis. 4 years it had taken him to level up, but he\u2019d find the company helpdesk *surprisingly* unhelpful if he tried to get his account back. Weirdly I felt an actual pang of guilt, but it's not like I was EA. \n\nFinally the kicker, his boss, a woman who had despised him for years and barely hid it, walked across the office with an envelope in hand. She carefully hid her smirk as she handed it to him, touched him on the shoulder and shook her head. \u201cSorry Stuart, new owners have decided a round of downsizing is in order.\u201d She looked around at the confused faces. \u201cBack to work the rest of you.\u201d\n\nAs he left the office, belongings carried out in a box, I wondered when he\u2019d realise that he had no home to go to and then, when he\u2019d consider where his pet tortoise was. I slid open my top drawer and dropped in a piece of lettuce \u2013 I wasn\u2019t a monster, he\u2019d get his pet back, but if you\u2019re going to ruin a man, you can\u2019t do things by halves.\n\nThat was another saying Pops always liked, but he always was a *very* smart man.\n\n***\n\n/r/fringly or /r/dcfu for various bits of my writing.

Trying to not breathe a single whiff of Mr. Taggart-call-me-Tag's cheap musky cologne, while the sticky heat from his sweaty, stubby fingers made their way across my shoulder blades in what I'm sure was supposed to be an inviting caress, rather than a repulsive accost. \n\n\"You see, Lucy, there are perks that come with my new promotion. Firing discretion is one of them. Now I know you pretty broads don't understand the big words, so lemme explain it to you plain: I. Own. Your. Job.\" Each of those last four words was punctuated by a gummy thumb rub. \"So go make me a coffee, Lucy, two sugars, one cream. And put a little sway on your way there. You know I hate to see you leave, but I love to watch you go.\" He chuckled at what he surely though was original wit. \n\n\"No\" I stated resolutely. \"Get it yourself.\" As I pushed my chair back to force him out of my personal space.\n\n\"Oh, Lucy. You're such a tease, you know.\" He said, becoming redder and sweatier. \"You see, I'm just a nice guy throwing a fat girl a bone. You're not hot enough to be such a bitch. So either go get me a coffee, or go get a box for your things.\", the smug bastard said, showing nicotine-stained teeth as his foul smelling spittle landed on my cheek.\n\n\"Get out of my way\" I said coldly,as I stood up, towering more that a foot over his balding head. I made up my mind in that instant that I was done pretending to be normal, \"one of them.\" I was not.  He had just won a first row seat to see how much more of a bitch I could be. \n\n \"I'm sure you last paycheck will be ready for you to pick up in about a month or two\".\n\n\"Keep it\" I said without turning back, as I applied my custom color Guerlain KissKiss Diamond Edition lipstick, a plan already forming in my mind.\n\nI got home a little after lunch and immediately started to work on fine-tuning even the most miniscule detail of his future destruction. This was now my full time occupation.\n\nIt was well after sunrise when my scheme was ready for execution. Operation Morningstar was a go. \n\nA few hours and several phone calls later, I got a text message from a blocked number with just three words: \" It is done.\" \n\nThe next day, an aunt he hadn't known existed, and who conveniently enough, had no other relatives, died and left him an inheritance. Not just a vase or a couch, either. Ten million dollars after tax. \nI spent the next months watching his life implode from all fronts. \nSometimes it is more fun to watch them destroy themselves. \nI watched him lose everyone who ever cared about him by showing his true self. It's funny how people with inferiority complexes will treat others as inferiors the instant they come in contact with a little money.\n\nI watched him start failed venture after failed venture. I watched him believe his money would last forever. That's why I had settled on that amount. It was enough to turn his life around, but not enough to buy him a permanent respite from any of his problems. I was there, observing when he surrounded himself with sycophants and supplicants, waiting for morsels to fall of his plate. I watched him fall into vices. I watched him fall into debt.\n\nThen finally, I watched him lose it all. \n\nOn the anniversary of our last encounter, he was called into the office of his bank account manager to discuss a payment plan for his ever growing debt. I was in a back room, waiting for my cue. Watching one last time. \n\nI saw on the monitor in front of me a gaunt, twitchy, shadow of a man who somehow still had not been humbled.\n\n\"Would you like to meet your benefactor?\"\n\n\"Benefactor?\"\n\n\"Yes, the person who gifted the ten millions.\"\n\n\"No one gifted me my money. It was family money\" he said  sneering in a petulant manner. \n\n\"It was family money, Sir. But unfortunately just not your family's. The money gifted to you came from a family whose fortune is, to put it plainly, older than dirt.\" Said the banker in his calm manner. \n \nHow right he was. How very *exactly* right he was.\n\nThis was my cue. I stepped into the office and cleared my throat. \n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Taggart.\" \n\nHis head whipped around while his eyes opened wide with surprise. \n\n\"L-L-Lucy?\" He stammered.\n\n\"Call me Lucifer.\"\n\n\n ",

            "comment": "*This place sucks.*\n\nThat was all Yuki thought when she walked through the doors of the office building. The work was mundane and easy, so long as she refrained herself from throat-punching her co-workers. Most all of them were annoying as hell, though Yuki didn't blame them.\n\nAt one point, Yuki was sure, that these people were all full of life and hopes, considering this place a stepping stone in their path to greatness. Now, they were trapped and dead in a place being run into the ground.\n\nHer nose crinkled as she nearly gagged on the coffee. Cold and somehow gritty. She glared at the old machine. Everytime she or Shiro bought and \"donated\" something to this shitty ass place to improve the lives of it's workers, somehow it always ended up \"missing\", replaced by the shit predecessors they had thrown in the trash.\n\n\"God-damned bitch...\" Yuki hissed under her breath as she marched down the hallway. She motherfucking knew Brenda was taking the shit home, she just couldn't prove it because the security camera's here didn't work because who the hell cares about office safety, right?\n\nAs she rounded the corner, she saw Riley standing rigid guard at a conference room. She arched an eyebrow, as usually he was down on the bottom floors patrolling, considering he was the only thing between them and someone who would want to cause the occupants here harm... It made her wonder why he was here.\n\nAzalea, Brenda's primary receptionist, popped her head out. She let out a small gasp, then grabbed onto Yuki, stopping her from going to her cubical. Yuki arched an eyebrow as the blond darted back inside, only to come back with her brother.\n\n\"Shiro told me he wanted to talk to you as soon as you got in.\" she spoke simply, opening the door wider to let him out. In the conference room, Yuki heard and saw loud sobs. Briefly, she saw a rather famous co-worker sitting in the corner sobbing into her hands. That took Yuki by surprise, Maddie was like the class-clown of this office, always finding a reason to joke and smile, thus her current state was... worrying.\n\nAzalea shut the door behind them, cutting them off from the scene. Riley gave them both a stern stare, hurrying them to move along.\n\n\"You know how Maddie's been worried about her sister's medicine?\" Shiro's voice dropped to a whisper as they reached the handicapped bathroom, locking it tight so they'd have a moment of privacy to talk. \"They just cut off her health insurance.\"\n\n\"What?\" Yuki hissed under her breath. \"That's completely... It's supposed to be provided by this place! They can't just take it away!\"\n\n\"Rosario and Erik are trying to calm her down enough to get the full story, but that's what it sounds like. They've been cutting back on privileges for months and months on these people and this is the last thing they can take away before they drop us all down to minimum wage.\"\n\nYuki knew this, deep in her heart. While the changes never personally effected her or Shiro, she heard the worries and vocal complaints around the office. First it started with Riley not being reimbursed for fixing the camera's out of his pocket. Rosario and Azalea getting half-hours cut from their paychecks. All of them wondering where the hell their bonuses went.\n\nShiro looked at Yuki, and she only nodded once. Shiro was already on the phone with Raven, discussing donating as much money as possible to Maddie in order to secure her and her younger sisters wellbeing for years to come.\n\nYuki had exited the bathroom to go back to her cubical, only to have a full on screaming match going on between Erik and Brenda. Well, more like Brenda was screaming at Erik and he couldn't be more than bothered to listen.\n\n\"Look at this place, it's disgusting! What are you doing canoodling with your coworkers when you could be making this place at least *look* decent!\"\n\nShe kept going on, freshly manicured hands flying in the air as hairspray and perfume wafted off of her like a desperate cloud of attention. The poor woman was hideous and in her late fifties but was doing her best to look like she was twenty one. It wasn't working.\n\n\"He isn't a janitor, you idiot.\" \n\nBrenda whirled around so fast that it was a wonder her implants didn't go flying off.\n\n\"What did you just call me?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" Yuki rolled her eyes, continuing to walk away. The lie was obvious and half the office was snickering or at least trying to keep their act together.\n\n\"Don't you walk away when I'm talking to you, Yucky! Yucky!\"\n\nHer voice rose a shrill higher as she mispronounced her name a second time. Yuki barely kept her cool as she made it to her cubical, until...\n\n\"*YUCKY, YOU ARE FIRED!\"*\n\nThe shrill scream caused the entire floor to go silent. Slowly, Yuki turned to look at Brenda. She was visibly sweating, red in the face, and look ready to burst at any moment.\n\n\"Mind repeating that?\" Yuki asked. Surely this *dumb bitch* didn't just say what she thought she just said. Brenda suddenly put her shoulders back, standing tall and proud as she lorded her so-called \"power\" over her subordinates.\n\n\"Yucky Smith, you are *fired* from this corporation.\"\n\n\"My name is *Yuki Shoda.\"* she hissed back, trying to figure out if she mixed up her name accidentally or on purpose. \"And are you *really* sure about that?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm sure. I don't need this much *toxicity* in *my* work environment.\" Brenda then turned on her heel. \"Besides, what could an *intern* possibly do?\"\n\nShe then left the scene, laughing like she was a villain who had just vanquished a hero. Yuki gripped the edges of her desk in rage, only to turn and leave. Whatever was in there, she could buy new anyways. As she descended the stairs, she started to laugh. What could an intern do? What could an *intern do?* Oh, Brenda had no clue the hell she's just unleashed.\n\n\"Raven,\" Yuki barked into her phone, barely able to contain her laughter. \"So get this, I got *fired.* This place was a shit hole anyways. So here's what I need you to do. Riley Meyers, Rosario Hart, Madeline Hatter, Erik Zeph, and Azalea O'Connor. I want all them working for me and Shiro before the end of the day, within close contact. Not even outside the city. Pay them whatever they want, be persistant, I don't *care*. Make sure they aren't working for her anymore. After that, dig into Brenda. I want *everything.* And I want her life *destroyed.\"*\n\nIt didn't take Raven long to follow through. Already, Yuki was getting information about Brenda's husband running off and demanding a divorce in favor of a much more pleasant high-school flame. Yuki would make sure Brenda lost everything in that divorce, no house, no car, no nothing. She wouldn't even get to keep her cat that she adored. \n\nYuki had detailed information about her being addicted to pain pills and how she got them. Oops, terrible shame, the doctor she shopped at suddenly got cut off. Oh, another botox surgery scheduled this weekend? What a *shame,* no more health insurance. For good measure, Yuki decided, she'd cut her pay down to minimum wage.\n\nBy the time she was done fucking around with Brenda's life, she had already gotten an excited, desperate response from Maddie and a confused text from Shiro. Yuki smirked. She'd take this company and the best employees, then put them in the right spots, where they belonged once Brenda was gone.\n\n*By the end of the month, we'll own this building and make it what it should have been.*\n\nYuki sent the text to her brother. She'd let the dumb bitch keep her job for now, no point in completely destroying her yet. She's wait a week *then* start leaking information about her laundering and abuse of employees to the higher ups.\n\n\"What can an intern do?\" Yuki chuckled under her breath as she watched Brenda's husband march into the office, lawyer at his side and papers in hand. \"A fucking lot, you stupid bitch. A mother fucking lot.\"",

I hardly considered pointing out the flaws in his business plan rude, it was free help from a successful billionaire, if anything, but bit my tongue. \"I implore you to reconsider, sir. You're losing a valuable asset.\"\n\nHe bellowed a laugh, spitting little chunks of steak and parsley onto the table. \"See, this is the problem with you fools. You think that, for some reason, there aren't ten million other '*middle class*' workers to take your place. Now please, leave before I lose my appetite.\"\n\nI smiled. \"I think that would be about as easy to lose as a mountain in your backyard.\"\n\nHe grumbled something through his lunch, but I'd already made my way out the door. It only took a few minutes to pack, since I never bothered to flaunt wealth in the office, and I stood at the entrance before leaving. I glanced across the mundane grey cubicles, like cookie-cutter housing in a suburb, frantic people running in and out of them. A few potted plants and cheap painting prints popped out against the grey, which only served to highlight its gloominess rather than distract from it.\n\n*Motherfucker calls me arrogant? Bitch, I make more money than you could stuff into that blimp of a body you ride around in. I worked in this shit office, watching you destroy it, with only a few comments here and there to help, and you never even knew who I was.*\n\nIt was a hideous office, no doubt. Absolutely atrocious, and a blatant statement by Buchanan that he didn't give a single shit about the workplace he created for his employees.\n\nWell. They're only *his* employees for now.\n\nOn the path to my car, I called my secretary. \"Helen? Yes. I need you to order a few things for me. Call Henry and tell him to hold an impromptu expo in two days. Call it 'Tech Expo 2019' or some shit, I don't care, but it needs to be hyped. Rumor needs to spread very quickly that the biggest names will be there, even if they won't be. Use contacts as necessary to fake the info. We'll need catering for it, preferably foods with honey like balaclava or whatever the fuck it's called, shit like that.\n\n\"And bees. A lot of bees.\"\n\n*Not only am I buying your company, asshole, but I'm getting a fucking discount.*\n\n-----\n\nParts two and three below!

But I suppose it's not just about my money, or connections, it's about how pathetically predictable desperate little corporate wannabes can be. The news of my pop-up tech expo, which was lazily named *Texpo* in my absence. I gave a good reaming to the intern who thought it was cheeky, telling him that if people come looking for fajitas, he'd be the door service letting them down and instead offering waterproof smartphones or vibrators that recharge with vigorous shaking.\n\nOnce news started to get out, with myself pitching up a booth, the applications came flooding in. There was even one for Microsoft, which we quietly denied, but whispered of to other potential vendors. I couldn't let things get *too* messy and ruin my own business connections.\n\nPreparations were occuring all over the state, my hand setting things in motion despite comfortable reclined on my couch. I had a computer warming my lap, with a bright red flash drive sticking out of it. One that a former coworker had replicated and provided to me discreetly for the small sum of $1k. The poorer the person, the less they sell themselves for. It's a bit sad, really.\n\nBut it was effective, and I clicked around in the slideshow with devilish glee, like a young boy being given a magnifying glass for the first time. I delegated most work to others, but this... this part was for me. \n\n\"Let's have a little fun with this, shall we?\" I swirled fifty-year aged Lagavulin in a crystal cup with a smile, but set it down with sudden realization. \"Oh, I almost forgot. Helen! Call my tailor. And call all the closest Chevy dealerships. I need a few.... custom items for later.\"\n\n-------------\n^(*writing between meetings oh god*)\n",

In the warehouse's expo floor, there was a little more dead space than I would have liked, but it was a manageable turnout. With a few rugs and some signs hanging, it looked complete enough to pass as an expo. A few YouTube tech journalists provided the cameras I needed without raising any weird flags.\n\nThere was a deliciously sweet scent in the building, of honey and sugar, with stands selling Mediterranean sweets, honey buns, honey-glazed donuts and honey... sticks. Apparently, some less refined people enjoy sucking on plastic tubes filled with honey. How odd.\n\nAll around me, I saw money. Everything is money to me, numbers like color slapped on every item, but it was a little different today. $20K hiding in the ceiling tiles. $5k attending the tech podium, helping vendors at the main stage set up presentations. $3k for the really annoying shitbag teenage kid asking kids to subscribe to his channel.\n\nI stayed in my booth, of course, shying away from letting Buchanan see me. God forbid he gets spooked. He wasn\u2019t the kind of man to check out other booths and see what new tech was being invented; he\u2019s too busy assuming the world is just lagging behind him. If that *were* the case, it\u2019d be a traffic jam caused by his beanbag ass, not him leading the pack. However, I made sure to pick a location where I could see the stage by peeking left.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d an middle-aged woman approached, disrupting my thoughts. \u201cNow *this* is what I\u2019m talking about. Finally representing women in these things, huh?\u201d\n\nI held up a Shake-Bate, giving it a haphazard flopping. \u201cNever run out of battery again, just go at it in manual for a while and this bad boy will be ready to go again in minutes.\u201d\n\nWhat, you think you become a billionaire by being *boring*?\n\nAn announcement saved me, the loudspeaker crackling. \u201cPresentations will now begin. First up is xTech.\u201d\n\nThe group gave their presentation, words muddled a bit by distance and crowd murmurings. Something about security systems and badging, typical boring shit these things draw in. An upcoming CPU creator, desperately hoping to be saved by some insanely stupid investor willing to bet against AMD and Intel. *Fuck it, I\u2019ll probably give him a call later.* \n\nAnd finally, once the mood had been set, I heard it. \u201cHammond Buchanon with Hammond Industries.\u201d Clever bastard that one was, with a self-named company. Maybe he wasn\u2019t fat, but just bloated with ego.\n\nThe comically large man lumbered on stage, setting a plate of sweets down on the stadium. Honestly, can one man, no matter how large, be *that* predictable? \n\nMr. $5k accepted an orange flash drive from him, but plugged a red one in. Not perfect, but close enough, by my estimations.\n\n*Go time, bitch.*\n\n\u201cHello, fellow technology pioneers. I am honored to be sharing our latest work with you all today.\u201d Buchanan said, jiggling with glee. The audience, however, was swept away by unsettled murmuring. The slideshow had loaded, the crowd turned a bright yellow by it, and in large, black text,\n\n#Beesiness is booming\n**Let\u2019s explore the latest tech buzz**\n\nAnd explore it they did, as the sound loomed overhead like overcast skies.\n\n------\n\n#[Finale](https://www.reddit.com/r/resonatingfury/comments/axb70y/the_billionaire_beekeper_final_part/)",

            "comment": "\u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nThe words burned my ears as they turned red with embarrassment. Of course I didn\u2019t need this job, but it really hits you right in the pride to be fired from a stupid office position. And for something as trivial as \u201ctaking too much time for lunch\u201d, which I only did because some asshole caused a pile up right down the street last Tuesday. It was on the news and everything, but Jim, my boss, still blamed me. Apparently I should have just left my car in traffic and walked back to the office or something. \n\nI think he\u2019s had it out for me since the beginning. That sleazeball tried to put the moves on me my first day, but I just ignored him without trying to be overly rude. After he realized he wasn\u2019t getting anywhere, he had been trying to find an excuse to get me out of here. The whole office was filled with women and spineless men and he wasn\u2019t a fan of people who didn\u2019t kiss his ass. I mostly just kept the job because it was easy. \n\nWhat Jim doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t know is I\u2019ve had it out for him too. As I packed up my stuff from my desk, my phone buzzed. It was Emilio, my PI on retainer. He watched my back for the people who wanted to steal my money. Nobody knew -I- had it, but they did know about Marceline Jovovich. That\u2019s the name I use when I wanted to purchase anything that might arouse suspicion of nice, mousy Jane McFarlin. That\u2019s not my real name either, but it\u2019s what everyone here knows me as. Marceline was also the face that made me the money I have today. It\u2019s not exactly legal, what I do, but it sure it fun.\n\nEmilio\u2019s text read, \u201cI found something you might want to see.\u201d Underneath was a picture of a first draft of a news article. It wasn\u2019t in a newspaper, just on the design layout. It read:\n\nLOCAL MAN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES FOUND GUILTY, FINED $5000\n\nI chuckled to myself. Bingo. We had been trying to find dirt on Jim for a while now and this seems like it was buried pretty deep. No doubt he paid more to get it covered up so his business didn\u2019t go down the drain. I never saw it on the local news, so I guess it didn\u2019t get any further than this draft. I don\u2019t think Jim is the violent type, but I do wonder what happened to the person who was writing this article. \n\nI finished packing up my stuff and walked down to my car, giving Jim the nastiest glare I could muster on the way out. The rest of my coworkers were giving me pity looks, but I just smiled and got out of there as fast as possible. When I got to my busted up VW bug, I put the box in the front seat and texted Emilio back.\n\n\u201cSend it.\u201d\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I turned on the TV to find Jim\u2019s face plastered all over the news. Emilio had even located his victims and convinced them to talk. We could pay them more than Jim ever could. As I watched the news unfold, I decided that maybe this would be as good a time as any to take a vacation.\n\n\nKarma is delicious. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

That pissed me off.\n\nLittle did he know I was rich. Not just \"Fuck you Rich\" but \"Fuck Me Rich.\"\n\nFuck you rich is where I can spend money to fuck someone over just as a fuck you. Fuck me rich is where I have enough that I can fuck myself in the process and even if it stings *a little*, it will hurt them *a lot* more.\n\nI had just wanted a job to kill time, relieve boredom, and hide the fact that I was stinking rich. Nobody expects the meek collator. But no, they had to screw around with me.\n\nThat's fine, I would just have to find other ways to relieve boredom. My initial thought was to just burn the place to the ground, but that would be too simple. \n\nSo instead I bought the company. My first move was to transfer out anyone who knew I was fired. Easily accomplished. I gave them a bump in pay and sent them to Detroit. Every time it looked like they would quit I would either bump their pay just enough to where they thought it made sense to be that miserable or just buy out the competition preventing them from leaving.\n\nPhase two was developing a squirrelly personality. Someone no one wanted to interact with. That was easy enough. I just modeled myself after the senior staff.\n\nThat's where things got fun. I started adding more and more administrative requirements from corporate. Reports, discussions, meetings. I added bureaucracy until everyone effectively had five to ten bosses and nothing could get done. I made the entire company a living hell.\n\nThe next phase was to call in auditors and consultants. Oh these guys were great. They were able to spot all the stupid rules that had made, all the redundancies, but even better they were able to bring a sense of dread to the company at large.\n\nAll the while, I waited, letting Bill move my desk from location to location. Stealing my stapler. Until the entire house of cards collapsed and then I burned the place down.",

            "comment": "People think having money makes your life better. The ability to pay your bills on time, have no debts, and enjoy the occasional vacation sounds nice. I can understand the appeal. But no one ever talks about having too much money. I\u2019m not talking about mansions and the ability to fly in a private jet..I\u2019m talking about buying the airline company and owning entire city blocks. \n\nWhen you have that much money, it gets hard to find joy in the little things. I never was one for flashy living. I think knowing you have the funds to buy multiple countries, takes the joy out of life, but that\u2019s just my thoughts on the matter. And when I say \u201cthat much money\u201d, I don\u2019t mean just millions. The kind of money Bill Gates has, just a couple times more. But I\u2019m not telling you that to boast. I\u2019m telling you in hopes that you may understand, but you can\u2019t, and you never will. And I suppose I\u2019m okay with that. \n\nSo what does one do after years of supreme boredom? After you have bought everything worth buying? Gone everywhere worth seeing? Hell, I\u2019ve even played the Good Samaritan card, donating nearly a billion dollars to various organizations without so much as a thought. But what to do now? Get a job is what I did. The most mundane, normal job I could find. \n\nIt was a large building. Nearly 70 stories tall, I worked on the 39th floor. I actually owned the building. But they didn\u2019t know that. I came in every day, from 9-5. Customer service for the products sold. The thing about customer service is people who call in think they are entitled to something. Always yelling at you over the phone. That this or that doesn\u2019t work and they demand to be compensated, or demand to speak to my supervisor. Most customer service employees never say anything rude to the customer. Hell they need the job, I get it. But I don\u2019t. I finally had enough. \n\nThe day started normal, I took a couple calls, had a break, started taking calls again. Get a call, someone upset about something. I apologize for the problems, offer to troubleshoot. They ask for a manger because \u201cclearly I don\u2019t know what I am talking about\u201d. The customer continues to shout and scream at me. Then they say something that really gets to me. \n\nMe- \u201cI would be more than happy to transfer you to my supervisor, I apologize once again, please hold one moment\u201d.\n\nCustomer- \u201c Good you low life idiot. Don\u2019t have a job if you don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re doing. You have waisted my time and are a disgrace to the company and society. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever spoke with someone as uneducated and retarded as you, you clearly will never go anywhere in life. Transfer me you fucktard.\u201d\n\nI laughed at the customer and her choice of words. Which was a mistake because heaven forbid anyone in the customer service industry have any feelings or defense for rudeness. People should always act professional even if someone is insulting them right? \n\nNo, fuck society and they way they treat customer service people. You stupid fucks who think it\u2019s okay for customers to belittle your employees are out of your mind. That\u2019s the kind of customer you want? Entitled pricks? ...no\n\nSo I transfer the customer to my supervisor. During the transfer I say \u201chey thank you for waiting on hold and being so patient. Oh and also you can go fuck yourself you should try being a decent human being for once and not yelling at someone who is trying to help you.\u201d\n\nThe line goes silent as both my supervisor in the customer sit there in amazement of what I just sad. I hang up the phone and go about my day. About 20 minutes later I get a call that I need to go up to HR. \n\nAs I arrive I step out of the elevator I already know what\u2019s coming. After a brief 10 minute conversation I am relieved of my position at the company and dismissed. As I walk out of the door I smirk. I had recorded the conversation with the customer and I. I was going to expose them to their social media friends. \n\nI paid someone 100,000 dollars to cleverly edit out my less desirable parts of the conversation. Hack into the companies data base and remove all records of my calls. And then posted  the interaction onto the mean customers Facebook page. It turns out they were politically active. And running for some small time local office. I also paid someone to manipulate the exposure the video got. It quickly rose to 10 million views, and gained local media coverage. They ended up losing their job and dropped out of the running. Friends and family of the customer I spoke with were appalled at their behavior and actions. They acted so nice on the surface. \n\nThe video had been posted anonymously. The title was \u201cwhose the fucktard now?\u201d. \n\n",

            "comment": "It was 5:30 AM. My 1969 Ferrari 512S Berlinetta raced down the highway. It was that time of the night, where the darkness was slowly fading to day, where the pitch black almost had a tinge of light to it. You couldn't see this in a city, which is why I was flying through the Tehachapi Pass. Well, that wasn't *the* reason, but it was close enough. I saw my exit, downshifted, and took the offramp at a freakish 120 mph. I shifted back, and was calmly cruising at 160 again, up the 99 to Fresno. I could've taken the 5 but... eh. I like less traveled roads. It was 6:00 AM. The sun was peeking out. By 10 I was back at my house in the Santa Cruz Mountains. I parked, switched to my 2006 Civic, or as I referred to it, \"The Shitbox\", and left for my day job. No work and all play really does make Jack a dull boy.\n\nI pulled into the parking structure. I could buy this company like my dickhead boss could by a Coke and I still had to deal with the prick. I sat at my desk, loaded my desktop, and the phone rang.\n\n\"Hi, this is Steve, how can I help you?\"\n\n\"Steve!\" I heard my manager's voice. I wanted to wring his neck. \"I need to talk to you.\"\n\nI walked to his office.\n\n\"Steve! Come in, have a seat. Do you know why you're here?\"\n\nI thought for a second, before realizing I didn't really give a shit. I was ready to just fucking sock him in the jaw.\n\n\"Look, the VP reviewed some things and you're just not pulling your weight around here. I'm sorry\"\n\n*No you're not you fucking prick. If you were you wouldn't be here.* I thought.\n\nI was being fired. I punched the douchebag boss in the face. Gut reaction, I guess. Out came my phone. With my vast resources, I'd have this mess cleaned up in no time.\n\n\"Jack, it's Steve.\" I called the CEO of a conglomerate in the same industry. I owned the parent company, but Jack ran his ship well, so I trusted him.\n\n\"Hey, what's up?\"\n\n\"I need you to make a purchase.\"\n\nI rattled the details off. 30 minutes later I got a text.\n\n    From: Jack\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;Done\nI made a couple more calls. Suddenly, my manager was out of a job, and blacklisted from our industry. He'd been working here 30 years and now that was all worthless.\n\nI called the bank that he'd done his car loan with, and his home loan. That Audi R8 he loved so much was about to be mine. As for his house, well, I think he needs to be taught a lesson. I owned the bank, so making a \"data entry error\" was as simple as calling a datacenter engineer and making sure his daughter got those medical treatments she needed. I wasn't totally heartless.\n\nAfter I'd foreclosed on everything I could take from him, and crushed his life like a soda can under a truck tire, I sat back. 3 months had passed. I was angry, but that was gone. I was now just... content. Happy. Relaxed. My revenge had worked. I sat in front of my fireplace, and looked at the urn with my grandfather's ashes.\n\n\"Thanks Gramps, for everything\"\n\nI swear, the little pyramid with the eye was staring right at me, and I was *sure* it glowed.",

            "comment": "Being a time traveler can suck sometimes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese days I find myself bored, but not in the have nothing to do sense. Quite the opposite, there\u2019s plenty to do, but I lust for enjoying the same thing over and over. Kinda like watching a rerun of your favorite episode of some trashy TV show. Currently, my vice of choice is pranking my former employer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mentor, known only as \u201cMr E.\u201d taught me I had to blend in to not be found. That sounded like a load of bull, having watched the man loot precious treasures from times long past. If you\u2019ve ever wondered why King Tut\u2019s cache was never found, or why so many sunken ships go missing, that\u2019s John\u2019s doing. He\u2019d type a quick Google search of how to enter a specific tomb or where a sunken ship was found, then time jump to the day after shit it the fan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI however, have lived the quintessential mediocre life my entire existence. Office life isn\u2019t quite the way TV shows picture it. Growing through my teens and into an adult without dreams, I contented to my comfortable dead end job as a telemarketer. \n\n  \n\nWorking at Call4Me was a comfortable routine, it was a paycheck that afforded me some of life\u2019s pleasures. When the boss called me in to give me the news, I was devastated. His smirk irked me, enjoying watching me squirm in discomfort. Some things you never forget, that moment was one of them. The end of a forgetful Friday, he called me into his office. I had one last call on the line; putting it on hold, I rushed towards the fogged glass door labeled \u2018Bart Kobold\u2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cPack your things Steve, you\u2019ll be given today\u2019s pay in addition to the severance package.\u201d He stayed seated, adjusting things on his immaculate desk, not even acknowledging me. Sweating, looking for something to say, my hands fidgeting my tie and shirt buttons. We all knew about 20% of the building was being laid off this month. They could pay kids in India a quarter our wage for the same outcome.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCowardly I turned and walked out, low self-esteem paired well with my lack of ambition. \u201cSorry, it was all I could do, please close the door behind you.\u201d I numbly obeyed and wandered to my blanch cubicle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a box on my desk with a sticky note, likely from my supervisor. \u201cSorry  -Karen.\u201d At least packing my things was easy, just my yellow notepad, BiC pen and a couple sci-fi favorites. We could read in-between calls, reading fantasy likely helped me stay sane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe \u2018hold\u2019 light from my phone console blinked. Not even registering my immediate unemployment, my brain fell into pattern as I adorned the headset. The caller ID read; \u201cMr. E.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cThank you for holding Mr. E, this is Steven of Call4U\u2026 how may we\u2026 be of service.\u201d As cliche as it sounds, saying this for the umpteenth and last time, brought me to tears. A man cleared his voice on the other end. \u201cDo you want payback?\u201d Click; he hung up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in my dingy studio apartment, my cat \"Tipsy\" was nestled into the lap of greying man. The cat plays with his braided beard, swatting at it with delight. The apartment complex resembled a motel, wallpaper tears and cockroaches included. As I keyed my door with an armful of groceries my landlord peered around the corner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You pay rent today?\" She shouts a lot, likely due to being hard of hearing and bad at English. \"I uh.. Tomorrow..\" I hesitate, and decided to keep my lack of a job secret \"was paid today, need time for bank.\" \"You good people, very quiet, thank you.\" She grins, a whistle escaping from her missing teeth. \"I let handsome family man inside your room, you are welcome!\" She walks off, shouting at the birds nestled in a nearby window. They flutter back as she rounds the corner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI slowly open the door to my 300 square foot apartment. Tipsy lounges in the dimming sun of the single window. \"Welcome home!\" The mystery man pulls the light string, illuminating my dinky closet of a room. I let out a girlish scream. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe returned from a time long past, assimilating into my now spotless apartment. Time control allows any object or activity to speed up or slow down, including cleaning and cooking, which I found to be quite useful. \n\n\"You said we can do that once per day?\" My curiosity was at an all time high this past week, having seen untold riches and witnessing historic events. Time travel was insane, but it seemed to have an effect on the veteran Mr. E. \n\n\"Yes, but each traveler can jump only 365 times. Total. And that... that was my 364th.\" He looks sorrowful as he recognizes what is to come. \"If I do not pass the torch, then this gift will be forever lost.\" He presents the wand to me, \"Why me?\" I stammer. \"Why not you?\" He locks his gaze with mine, and I begin to understand. \"You were meant to have this Steven. For better or for worse, I was drawn to you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I reach for the wand, whom my impromptu father figure calls the \"Torch,\" tears strew down his face. This was a power he was destined to give, and today was the day. Upon grasping the wand, a surge of knowledge entered me, and I understood. When I regained consciousness he was gone.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first couple time trips I made were to be for practice, playing it safe. Still harboring a grudge for my former employer, Bart Kobold was to be my first 'victim.' I decided to go back in time and prevent him from getting HIS job, thus never having any power over me. Fool-proof. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSetting the time his LinkedIn profile said he had the job soundly in my mind; the torch was lit. I was soon standing in-front of an empty soon-to-be Call4U. Bart was begging at the feet of a brown suited business man. Blending in, I adorned a hard hat and find myself writing in my notepad, acting busy. From what I overheard, the project was months behind, and Bart was refusing to show the older man the rest of the building. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Please Carl, the contractors said max two more months, that's all I need!\" Bart pleaded. \"You've had too much time already, I'm axing this project.\" Carl pulls out a RAZR cellphone to make the final call. \"My wife is going to kill me, we're behind on our payments and our son is in the hospital!\" Bart paces madly, barring entry into the unfinished sections. Feeling sorry for my former boss, I decide I'd rather help than hinder. With a flick of my wrist, the Torch enchants the building process. As if some grown man's version of Disney princess magic, the construction animatedly begins. The pilings pile, the concrete pours, and the foundation is set. Within seconds, the building blocks of my future office prison are finished.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they enter, I exit. The reactions I overheard seemed akin to a home-makeover montage. He got the job. \n\n...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a time traveler can suck but only some \"times.\" Everything happens as it should, we learn from our mistakes and as such our futures can burn far brighter. \n\nThe torch is lit, allow it to illuminate the life ahead of you and shine on the past behind you.\n\n...\n\n..\n\n.\n\nThank you for reading, any feedback you have helps me become a better writer! I hope to do a minimum 500 word prompt every day, this is the first of many.",

            "comment": "It wasn't the firing that got me, it was the way Chuck did it.  Sure I had been goofing off a bit at work, but who wouldn't after being the secret heir to the Buffet/Musk fortune. There was only so long I could pretend to care.   My boss walked over and said \"Sorry chum, I'm going to have to let you go.\"  He  said CHUM.  He knows I hated that word. I had told him that  three times in the last 2 months and he had apologized each time and said he wouldn't use it anymore with me.  I am sure he used it on purpose when he let me go to be petty.  That's ok.  If he wants to play the petty game, let's play the freaking petty game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChuck was a fanatic about his car, a white 2013 Hurst Edition Chevy Trans AM.  He lovingly hand washed and waxed it every weekend.  At work, he parked at the empty far end of the lot to prevent door dings, which I respected.  He wasn't one of the d-bags that double parks in spots other people would likely use.  Since I knew Chuck loved his car so much, I decided this would be the start to my fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hired Tanya, a very discrete logistics expert with a ton of contacts as my assistant.  She would interact with everyone else to keep my identity secret.  Through her we hired a team consisting of 2 ex-Mossad agents, 1 ex-CIA surveillance specialist, 2 automotive body shop experts, a master forger, 2 Hollywood special effects experts, a mechanic, and a couple of people to buy supplies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had the surveillance guy get tons of pictures of  Chuck's car. He made sure to get everything in high-res detail.  Not just the car, but also copies of all the paperwork in the glove compartment and center console like insurance, registration and the single crumpled receipt from Target that was far under his seat that Chuck hadn't noticed but we had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrough a shell company, we bought 10 white 2013 Hurst Edition Chevy Trans AMs.  The team worked together to make all the cars look identical to Chuck's.  The same paint, same VIN, the right general mileage, the radio presets, the locks, all the paperwork in place.  We even got the slight wear on the steering wheel, driver's side window sill, and seat to match perfectly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime to put the plan into action.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTonya hired an actor to portray a potential high-value client who scheduled an appointment with Chuck. This way we'd know when he would be in a conference room and away from his office.  Chuck's office has a view of his car, and we wanted to make sure we'd have at least 5 minutes to do the work without him seeing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we got the signal that Chuck was meeting with our actor, one of the ex-Mossad guys patched a loop into the company's surveillance cameras that covered the parking lot. We had breached the company's security two weeks ago, but all we cared about was making sure we could access the cameras and had audio access to the security room.  We even patched up a few other security holes we found to make sure nobody else could break into the network and cause a security audit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur two panel vans pulled up near Chuck's car and parked to block the view.  The team did did a quick scan of his car to see if anything changed and made sure we got the mileage right on our first decoy car.  We loaded up Chuck's car into one van, and unloaded the decoy car into place.  Before leaving, one of the auto-body guys made a big deep scratch, down to the metal in the side of the driver's side door of the decoy car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce the team was away, we set the surveillance cameras back to normal, and I watched the video feed myself at 5:30, when I knew Chuck would soon be walking out to his car.  The view wasn't great since he was parked so far from the building, but I could see him run the last few steps to his car when he saw the big scratch.  Chuck spent a few minutes looking at the scratch and then called his friend Tom, who owns an autobody shop.  Of course we had a tap on Chuck's phone.  Tom said he could bring the car tomorrow morning and he'd have his best guy fix the paint, but it would probably take 2 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night, Chuck slept extra well since we had added a small bit of benzodiazepine to Chuck's scotch.\n\nDuring the night, we stealthily switched the decoy car and Chuck's car in his garage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Wilhelm was the local catchpole and ratcatcher, or so everyone assumed. In truth, he was Wilhemn Von Mittlesdorf, Prince of the Shattered Shores. Most people thought it was a lawless land of petty warlords and despots. It was, but there was one law: sixty per cent. That percent was Wilhelm's cut. He was, quite honestly, the richest man alive.\n\nPolitics and fame bored him. He longed for the idyllic peasant life. And that, of course, brings our tale here. For Wilhelm was being fired by the local reeve, a fat, slovenly oaf by the name of Karl.\n\nWilhelm accepted the firing with quiet, reserved dignity. He returned to the reeve the symbol of the catchpole's office, and left. Returning to his small, humble home, upon which he had spent most of his earnings from catching rats and criminals, he found a notice nailed on its front. The reeve had seen fit to evict him, as well!\n\nThis made Wilhelm incredibly angry. Firing he could take. The loss of his home incensed him. He opened the door and took but one item: an amulet shaped in the manner of a pursed mouth, and spoke to it quietly.\n\n\"I will reduce it to fifty five, if conditions are met.

            "comment": "I didn't always have this money.    I was poor growing up.  My mom worked 3 jobs to feed us.  She barely kept us housed.  We lived in a run down shack in the middle of the ghetto.  It wasn't much.  2 bedrooms, one bath, but it housed all 4 of us kids.   \n\nUnfortunately, momma died at work, and the house was foreclosed on.   All of us were taken in by relatives, except for me.  I had a 35 hour a week job at Jimmy Zipp's sandwiches.    It was minimum wage, but it kept the bedroom I was renting from somebody paid.   \n\nI was going to school online while working at Jimmy Zipp's.   I then got my associates degree in database management.   I then got my real first full time job.   Ahh, I remember my first few paychecks.    I bought a trailer home on the outskirts of town for me and my 3 other siblings.   Then I bought my own land.   My story would end there, on a much happier note, but that's not the end of the story.    This is my story of how I managed to fire my boss.   \n\nAfter buying a trailer home on the outskirts of town with my first 5 paychecks, and buying my brothers and sister a house, I decided to splurge.  What could be better than having my own land AND my own home?  I looked up cheap land, and the first thing I saw was desert land in Arizona.   I bought it on the spot.  10K for 5 miles worth of land?  I'm in!  \n\nMy only sister didn't like the fact that I was buying land.   She thought it could go towards a nest egg.   I told her this:  \"Angel,we had hard lives.  We're not going to live very long.   At least this way, we have something when one of us dies\".  \n\nShe sadly concured.   \n\n The land I bought was nothing, really. No access to water.  Nothing.   Just some desert land in Arizona.   I figured I'd use it as coyote hunting land and sell the pelts for an extra few dollars to supplement my income.   I hated coyotes.  After one bit off the leg of my favorite cat and killed my sister's dog, I made sure that I was going to kill them to no end.   \n\nSo, for my first vacation that I would ever take as a man with a full time job, I decided to go to my property in Arizona and hunt for some coyotes.   \n\nIt started off well enough.   I shot a few with my bow.   I got 10!   \n\nBut I noticed something funny about them.   \n\nThey were moving rather slowly on my property.   Slow enough to where I could simply throw rocks at their heads and they'd simply fall down dead.   I did that to 15 or 20 coyotes  When I picked up their pelts, I noticed that their lips were wet and green.   \n\nDidn't matter.  I simply sold the pelts to the tannery down the street\n\n\"Jack\", the tanner said...\n\n\"I'm not going to give you as much money as I would.  These yotes seemed to have ingested a lot of copper.  I had to remove it from their hides.   Here's $30,000.  Normally, I would pay about 140,000 for this many pelts.\"   \n\nI didn't care.  It was 30K  more than I would have had if I were still working at Jimmy Zipp's sandwiches like I used to.  \n\nAnd the cute, middle aged lady down the street thanked me because a yote injured her cat too.   \n\nI went to the gift shop down the street to buy some nice things.  I pledged to spend only 1,000 on myself, and give the rest to my brothers and sister.   \n\nRight now is Jack time.  \n\nI walked into the gift shop.  I talked to the shopkeep.  \n\nI asked \"How much is that watch over there?   It looks rather nice\".\n\nThe storekeeper said \"Oh, it's not too much.  It's about $360.\"\n\nI was shocked at the price.\n\n\"360$?  What's it made of, baby's teeth?\"\n\nThe shopkeeper said \"No, silly, it's made out of silver that was mined 10 miles down the street.  What, you can't afford this?\"\n\nNormally, I would say \"no\", because I'm used to earning 20K a year at Jimmy Zipp's.   But this was my first office job.  I was making 3X that.  Plus I had this extra 30,000$\"\n\nI pulled out 4  Benjamins I had in my pocket and I told the shopkeep \"Sold!\".   \n\nI used that money to buy my first item that was ever made out of a precious metal before.  It was a handcrafted sterling silver watch.   It was the finest watch you could ever look at.   I then used the change to buy myself a steak dinner.   I've never had a steak dinner before.   Back when my mom was alive, we'd have Salisbury steak.   That's the closest we'd ever get.   \n\n\nI went back to my property in AZ and pitched a camp.   \nWhen I woke up, I saw a weak, but hungry coyote coming after me.  I picked up a bow and I shot it, dead in the head.  It dropped.\n\nI saw a bunch of sickly looking yotes around me.  They couldn't even catch up to the neighbor's cat.\n\nI noticed there were a bunch of dead coyotes on my property, all leaving a trail.  I followed the trail....   \n\nWhen I followed the trail, I noticed there was a giant, green colored pond in the middle of my property.   \n\nThere were a few dead coyotes on the pond.  God, it stank.  \n\nIt smelled like old pennies and rotting flesh.   That's when I realized I had copper on my property!\n\nI immediately called a lawyer and we arranged to sign a contract with a mining company.   \n\nWithin a week, the contract was signed and I was officially 300 million dollars richer.    \n\nMy vacation was ending, so I took the next plane out of Phoenix and I jetted back home.   There was a little delay.   I phoned in work and told them I was going to be a bit late.  \n\nThe department lead was rude to me and told me if I didn't show up there within a reasonable time, they were going to write me up.   \n\nThis was uncharacteristic of them.   Usually, they're extremely kind.  Something's up.   \n\nI played along to their meanness though.  I theoretically didn't need the job.  I had my own money now and I could tell them to kiss my ass.  But because I didn't want to forget where I came from, I stuck with the job.   I rented a car and I zipped it straight to downtown, where I parked the car.  I was still reeking of coyote guts.  \n\nWhen I got back to work, I noticed that my old manager wasn't there anymore.  He was kicked upstairs, into another department, at another branch.  We got this new guy named Dejerrick.   No wonder why things were different.  We had a new guy here.  And the guy was a douchebag, to say the least.  \n\nDejerrick was a portly African American male, who honest to god, was the scum of the earth.\nHe always wore bling wherever he went.  He was short, ugly and stank of cigarettes. But lord, he had an ego. He acted arrogant and aggressive.  Like he was compensating for something.  The guy thought because he had street cred, it automatically transferred into a corporate environment.   The other African Americans at work hated him.  They thought he was reinforcing negative stereotypes about African Americans.  Every negative stereotype about African Americans you could think of, my manager embodied them.  \n\n My best friend Jimmy, who was also black, hated him the most.    I knew better than to judge other black people because of Jimmy.   My co-workers didn't because they didn't really experience black people a lot. I did because I grew up in the inner city.    Other people at work especially hated DeJerrick.  It broke my heart because Jimmy got some of the brunt of the hate too,  just because of the color of his skin.   \n\nDejerrick could pick up on Jimmy's disdain for him.  Dejerrick made sure to turn Jimmy's life into a living hell.  \n\nJimmy wasn't like \"all the other black people\".  We struck up a friendship after I saw a Black Sabbath tattoo on his arm.  We were both fans of heavy metal.  I also liked the fact that his name was Jimmy and I loved my time working at Jimmy Zipp's.   We hung out together every day after work.  But not even Jimmy knew that I was a multi-millionaire.  To Jimmy, I was just the guy who lived in a trailer on the outskirts of town.  He drove a Ford Focus.  I drove a Hyundai Accent.   We were two very ordinary people with two very ordinary lives.  \n\nJimmy just called me over the phone.   \"Hey Jack, let's hit up a metal show over in Finland.  I heard from one of my buddies over there that Finland's about to legalize MJ.  They're not going to make it official though until next week.  Wanna hit up Finland in about a month?  Think about it, man.  Heavy metal, Finnish women AND weed!\".  \n\nI responded to Jimmy \"No, man.  I have this database I have to build.  DeJerrick wants it done by next week, or else I'll be fired\".    \n\nJimmy responded: \"Oh god, doesn't that idiot know that databases like that take at least 2 weeks to build?\"\n\nI then told Jimmy in a laughing manner \"Yeah, that's why it's going to be built so shoddily that he's going to end up getting yelled at by the CEO about how crappy the build is.\"   \n\nI show up to work the next day.  \n\nOn my break, I called up my stockbroker and I told him to invest in some marijuana stocks.  They were going for 50 cents a share.  I knew those things were going to explode in value soon.   I just didn't know how soon.  I  called up my stockbroker.   \n\n\"Juan, I'd like to buy 2 million dollars worth of Mary Jane and Herb's Green Grass Company\"\n\nHe said to me \"Meh, it's your money\". \n\n\n",

You won't believe this, \n\nbut Mary Jane and Herb's became Northern \n\nFinland's EXCLUSIVE marijuana grower.  \n\nGuess what that makes you?\"  \n\nI then said in a joking manner \"A drug \n\ndealer?\"  \n\nJuan laughed.  \"No, that makes you 600 \n\nmillion dollars richer if you sell now, \n\nyou silly goose.  You'll become a \n\nbillionaire many times over if you stay.\"\n\nI then responded to Juan \"I'll hang on to \n\nthose weed stocks and call you back \n\nlater.  I have a database to build\".  \n\nDeJerrick overheard the last snippet of \n\nthe conversation.   \n\n\"Dude, why are you talking about illegal \n\ndrugs at work\"?\n\nI responded to him \"I'm buying marijuana \n\nstocks.  100% legal, since the company is \n\nbased in Canada and its supply is in \n\nFinland, a country that just legalized \n\nweed\". \n\nYou're not supposed to talk about \n\npersonal business during company time.  \n\nI'm going to write you up for discussing \n\nillegal activities at work.   \n\n\"It's not illegal in Finland\"\n\n\"Don't tell me about that Finland \n\nbullshit.  Do you see polar bears and \n\nknockwurst around here, you Wal Mart \n\nclothes wearing dipshit?  With all that \n\nmoney you're making selling coyote pelts, \n\nyou should at least be able to afford a \n\nnew phone.  Now use the recording feature \n\nof your phone to record our conversation \n\nwith HR for posterity purposes\"  \n\nThe knockwurst comment really pissed off \n\none of my other coworkers.   Nieminen's \n\ndad was from Finland, and he was still in \n\ntouch with his Finnish heritage.   He \n\nwanted to tell DeJerrick \"Knockwurst is \n\nGerman, you ghetto dipshit\", but he \n\ndidn't want to get into trouble with HR.  \n\nTechnically, DeJerrick was right.  I was \n\ndiscussing illegal activities at work.  \n\nBut I was also technically right because \n\nit's not against the law for US Citizens \n\nto invest in marijuana stocks in other \n\ncountries.  Nieminen gave Dejerrick the \n\nstink eye.   \"Shut up, Nieminen, or else \n\nI will write you up too.\"   \n\nHe was universally loathed.   Especially \n\nhow he treated Nieminen.  We all called \n\nFrank Nieminen \"The Friendly Finn\".  He \n\nwas the kindest man you'd ever meet.  Me, \n\nJimmy and Frank the Friendly Finn were \n\nknown as \"The Triplets\".   \n \nHR had a long talk with me.  They told me \n\none more slip up and I'll be fired.  They \n\nwere also gunning for Jimmy and Frank.   \n\nThey sent both of us home early.  Me and \n\nJimmy then went to the bar and got \n\nsmashed.   Frank went home to drink his \n\nfavorite aquavit.   Me and Jimmy went to \n\nthe bar to drink some Goose Island.   \n\nThat motivated me into going full ZFG \n\nmode.  As in zero fucks given.   To \n\ncelebrate my ZFG mode, I was going to buy \n\nsome more stock.  \n\nSome guy was leering at us with a \n\nmurderous wrath.  He the asked us with a \n\nnear homicidal tone \"So, you guys are \n\nbuddies?\"  He gave us the look of death \n\nwhile looking at our employee ID badges.\n\nI then responded with a defensive tone. \n\n\"Yeah, so what, he's black, I'm white, \n\nwhy is it your business?\"\n\nThe stranger's face then brightened up. \n\n\"Yeah, dude, I thought for a second he \n\nwas that DeJerrick asshole everybody in \n\nthe valley hated.  I heard stories about \n\nhim.  I saw your employee badge and I \n\njust assumed your friend here was \n\nDeJerrick.  He used to work for us, but I \n\nnever met him personally.\"   \n\nI responded back to the drunken stranger. \n\n\"Hah, no.  We're about to get fired \n\nbecause of that asshole\"  \n\nThe drunken stranger, who now identified \n\nhimself as Ian, then laughed his ass off. \n\n \n\n\"Hey, lemme guess, he blames all of the \n\nill feelings you have towards him on \n\nracism, right?\"\n\nI then said \"No, but that's the overtone \n\nI get\".\n\n\n\nIan then responded \"He must be pissed \n\nbecause he can't try that racism \n\nhorseshit on your black friend here, I \n\nthink that's why he's taking it out on \n\nhates you the most.  He tried that shit \n\non some black guy who worked at our \n\ncompany.  Turns out, that was the CEO's \n\nadopted son.\"   \n\nIan responds \"Sounds like DeJerrick.  We \n\nhad a Nigerian guy quit because he \n\ncouldn't stand DeJerrick's hotep \n\nhorseshit.\"  \n\nIan then responds to me in a much happier \n\ntone.  \"How about this, if I tell you \n\nthis, you won't ever admit to meeting me. \n\n But our company is about to be acquired \n\nby Microsoft.  If you want to buy stocks, \n\nbuy them in our company now.   That's why \n\nwe fired DeJerrick.  His attitude almost \n\ndestroyed the merger. \"\n\n It was in a tech company.  I got some \n\ninsider information that the company was \n\nabout to be acquired by Microsoft... but \n\nwho would know?  Some random guy at a bar \n\ntold me about it.  He was getting laid \n\noff anyway, and he didn't care if people \n\nknew about the acquisition.  \n\nMe and Jimmy went to work the next day \n\nhung over.   \n\nDuring our lunch break, me, Jimmy and \n\nFrank started talking so much shit about \n\nDeJerrick around the work campus.   I \n\nknew I was going to get fired, but I \n\ndidn't care.   \nThe friendly Finn starts in on the \n\nDeJerrick bashing. \n\n\"If I called DeJerrick a spear chucking \n\nmonkey hunter, I'd get fired.  But he can \n\nmake incorrect stereotypes about Finns \n\nand get away with it.  Eff him!\".   Frank \n\nlamented.\n\nJimmy starts in.  \"God, DeJerrick brags \n\nabout the most unimportant shit in the \n\nworld.  He has a new Beemer.  BFD.  He \n\nacts like because I drive a Ford Focus, \n\nI'm not as good as he is.  For god's \n\nsake, if he were that bright, he'd notice \n\nthe lift tickets I have on my Spyder \n\njacket.  Something he doesn't know exists \n\nbecause he simply doesn't have that money \n\nfor real.\"\n\nDeJerrick hears us all talking smack \n\nabout him, but can't pinpoint who it is.  \n\n He gives us the middle finger and walks \n\noff.   \n\nOn my break, I called up Juan.  \"I'd like \n\nto buy 2 million dollars worth of \n\nMicroprocessors by Matt\".  \n\n",

You're going to lose money on it\".   \n\nI then told Juan \"No, I'm not.  I'm going to buy this company and try to get a government contract.\"  \n\nJuan laughed his ass off over the phone.   \"Ok, you joker.  Now that you're telling me all this stuff, I think you might have a guy on the inside who's givng you some details\"\n\nI then told him the truth, but in a manner that's so sarcastic, that he didn't bother reporting me to the feds.\n\n\"Some drunken guy at a bar who used to work for the company told me that they were going to be purchased by a mega hyper super mondo corporation, and I'm going to swoop in before the merger is official!\"  \n\nHe then said \"I'll leave you be.  Enjoy your government contract, lol\".  I have some good news on the copper mine and marijuana front too.  You're now up to 700 million dollars worth of output for the copper mine, and the stock you own in Mary Jane and Herb's is now worth 500 million.  Congratulations, dude, you're officially a billionaire. \"  \n\nDejerrick heard most of the conversation.    \n\n\"You're wasting all of your money on a company I used to work for?  God, you're stupid.  Maybe this is why you weren't working on your databases on time.  This will show how serious I am.  \"   \n\nI saw the Friendly Finn pack his belongings.   There was a cross shaped scar on the wall, where his blue tape, shaped in the Nordic cross of the Finnish flag was stuck up.     \n\nHe noticed my silver watch.  He mocked me for it.  \n\nHe noticed my swagger.  Like I didn't care what he said.   I then came out to him and I told him off.  But I didn't want to play my entire hand.   \n\n\"Dejerrick, technically, I don't need this job.  Look at some of the things I have.  I have land and I have a business that pays me way more than I can earn here.  My coyote pelts earned me 40,000 alone.  That's how I paid for this watch.  I paid for my lot rent and all of my siblings lot rents for 5 years\"\n\n\"You're going to act like you're blinging with silver, dead wolves and stock in a failing company?  And you live in a trailer?  Dude, look at my watch.  It's gold.  Now get your ass back to working that database or else You'll have to pawn your watch for gas money\".   \n\nI had enough of his crap.  I went straight to the CEO about it.  \n\nI brought it up to the CEO that DeJerrick was making the workplace a hostile area.  \n\nHe then said \"Well, Jack, you're not a team player.  I get along with DeJerrick just fine.  I've had enough of your racist overtones.\"\n\n\nI looked into the bosses' eyes and I said something that was sure to get me fired.  I told him this:    \"That is the biggest load of horseshit I've ever heard, and I used to work retail for a sandwich company.  My best friend is black, you dumbass.  If he knew anything about the company you managed, you'd notice that.\"   \n\nThe CEO then had security escort me to my desk.   \n\nThe security guard later told me that I had to clean it because I was getting let go. \n\nMy annoyance turned to wrath.  I was going to put both the CEO and DeJerrick in their places.   \n\nBut first, I needed a regular job.  That way, I won't let people know how much money I have.  I re-applied at Jimmy Zipps. \n\nThe next week, I was given an interview.  The hiring manager saw my resume.  He liked my experience.  But he didn't want to hire me.   \n\n. \"I'm sorry, sir, but you're overqualified for this job.  Database manager?  No.  You'll get bored here\"   \n\nI pulled out my dilapidated flip hone and I made a quick phone call. \n\n\"Is this James?\"\n\n\"Yeah, Jack!  Long time no speak!  How have you been\"\n\nThe hiring manager overheard the owner's voice!\n\nTHe dorky kid said \"You have Jim on speed dial?\"  \n\nAnd I responded \"Yeah, I worked for this company back when it was only 4 stores and Jim's dream\".   \n\nThe dorky kid was astounded.   \n\nI then asked the owner a question. \"Yeah, James, who owns the Wallace Hills store?\"\n\n\"Charles Mauser.  But why would you want to know.\"\n\n\"Get me Charles Mauser\"\n\nThe hiring manager seemed nervous.   \n\nHe then said nervously \"I've known Chuck for 3 years.  He's not going to let me hire some overqualified worker who'll quit in 2 weeks.  Leave now.\"\n\nI left the store.  4 hours later, I walked up to the store manager... \n\n\"Hey, you're the guy that refused to hire me, right?\" I said, in a condescending tone.  \n\nHe then said \"Yeah.  Didn't I tell you to leave the store?\"   \n\nI then responded \"Call the police\".\n\nThe police arrive 20 minutes later.   \n\nI showed the police my 40% ownership certificate in Jimmy Zipp's sandwiches, with James holding up a sign that says \"I'm proud of you, son\".   \n\nThe police go up to the hiring manager.   \n\n\"Why are you trying to kick your owner out of the store?  You're wasting our time\".   \n\nThe hiring manager then says \"This isn't the owner.  He's just some white collar stiff that wanted to work for us again.  Charles Mauser is the owner of this franchise.  Some guy named Joey Fisher bought some of it today, but this guy's name is't Jack Joey.\"   \n\nI then responded in an annoyed tone \"No, it's J.O. Fisher.  As in Johnathan Olin Fisher.  Not Joey.  But you can call me 'Jack Fisher', or better yet, your boss. \"   \n\nI then show him my driver's license.  Sure enough, he recognized my name.   \n\nI then look sternly at the police.  \"Leave my property or else I'm calling the Chief\".  \n\nThey bolted.    \n\n\"Shut up and start wrapping sandwiches, nerd boy.  I'll help you\"  \n\nI worked that job for 2 weeks.  I was bored.  He was right.  I wasn't happy working that job.  Then I get a phone call from a certain Red Wing Insulation.  For DeJerrick Washington.  \n\nI'm going to deliver his sandwiches!!",

                                    "comment": "\"Hey Shawn, I'm about to fill out this order.\"   \n\nI personally delivered DeJerrick's sandwiches to him.  \n\nHe gave me the most condescending of all stares, like he was better than me.   I smiled, nodded and chuckled.  I waved hi over to Jimmy. \n\nJimmy ignored me.  He pointed over to the wall scar where the Friendly Finn's cross used to be, as a signal that he didn't want to get fired.   \n\nI knew that I had to do something, or else my best friend would be in peril.   \n\nI knew something was up with DeJerrick.  So I hired a PI on him.  I thought I was going to get stories about corporate espionage.     \n\nNope.  This was even jucier.  My PO showed me video of DeJerrick.   \n\nTurns out, DeJerrick had a bunch of side chicks he wasn't telling his wife about.   \n\nWoah, he's been stealing company property.   \n\nHmmm....  It would be kind of petty to simply post this in public.  \n\nNo. I thought of doing something even more cruel.\n\nI'm going to make his life a living hell.   \n\nAfter my shift at Jimmy Zipp's was over, I decided to make some more purchases.  \n\nI saw that Wallaby Security, Red Wing's security contractor,  was a publicly traded company on the local Stock Exchange.   \n\nI bought 51% of the company for 5 million dollars.  It was now mine.   But that wasn't the big fish I was looking for.      \n\nI wasn't done yet.  It was only Thursday and I'm now the owner of a security company.   I wanted more.   \n\nI then got word that Redline, Red Wing's parent company, was looking to make some more money by selling some stock.   \n\nAs I returned to the property, with a security escort to gather the rest of my old belongings, I asked to be directed to the CEO of the company. I told the security guard \"It was urgent business.\"   The head security guard refused.  \n\nI said \"Remember hearing about a man named Johnathan Olin Fisher buying your company a week ago?\"  \n\nThe security guard said \"Yeah, Jack...  your point?  Is he your uncle or something?  Get your stuff out of here before I call the police.\"\n\nI then said \"He's not my uncle, but I'm your daddy.  My legal name is Johnathan Olin Fisher.  Check my I.D.  There aren't any other Jonathan Olin Fishers in this country.   Send me to the CEO or else you're fired.\"\n\nThe security guards said \"Sure thing, Mr. Fisher\".\n\nI then talked to the CEO of the company.   \n\nOn my way to the CEO's office, I called up my stockbroker again.\n\n\"Yes, Juan, I'd like to buy 5,000 shares of Redline Productions\"\n\nThe security guard overheard what I said.   \n\n\"That's the parent company of this corporation, you don't have that kind of money.\"\n\nI responded to the grunt.  \"I bought your company now, didn't I\".\n\nHe then quieted down.   \n\n\"Shut up, or else I'll fire you\" I yelled.\n\n\"Yes boss\" He responded sheepishly.\n\nSure enough, I became the owner of Redline Productions.....\n\nAs soon as I got to talk to the CEO.\n\n\"What are you doing here\" He asks.\n\n\"You're in my seat.  Get out\", I barked at him.\n\nThe CEO then gets on his radio.   \n\n\"Security, please get this man out of my building\"\n\nThe security guard says \"I can't, he's our boss\"\n\nThe CEO says \"What do you mean!?  He's just some grunt who kills coyotes on his spare time.\"\n\nWell, he's some grunt who now owns the company.\n\n\"So that's the Johnathan O Fisher who bought our company!\" The CEO cried in bemusement.\n\nI then said in a smug tone \"Yes, now get out of mys eat.  Bring in DeJerrick Washington\".\n\nDeJerrick gets a radio call.  \"Washington, the CEO wants to see you.\"\n\nDeJerrick then comes up to the top floor.  \"I don't see a CEO,I just see some dork with no swag who's trying to tell me what to do, even though he no longer works for this copany.  \n\nGet your fake ass silver out of here.\n\nI pull out my silver pen, and I grab a pink slip from the termination notice pile.  \n\nDeJerrick, you own a gold plated Bulova.  This silver watch you make fun of me for owning was purchased from the silver mine that borders my copper mine.     Speaking about copper mines, these coppers are MINE, and I want you out of this building or else MINE coppers will turn you ewer to the police.   \n\nWhat do you mean, you retard?  You couldn't even complete a database on time.  I had to get your best friend to do it.  Security, take this joker away.\n\n\"Can't, DeJerrick.  He's our boss.  And yours.  He now owns 20,000 shares of the Redline Corporation\".\n\n\"DeJerrick....  I know this will help you since your severance package isn't going to last that long, but how about I buy your watch from you for 12,000$, just so you will go away\"\n\nHe's shocked.\n\nI then respond to him.  \"Copper isn't cheap. And neither is silver\"\n\nThen he walks out of the door in shame, holding his belongings in a bag.\n\nI then make Jimmy the CEO and I rehire Frank.   \n\nI went back to my land in Arizona, hunting coyotes.   \n\nLife is good",

            "comment": "I woke up this morning the way I usually do. Sprawled out on my pullout couch in my studio apartment to my alarm clock - coffee maker setting up a fresh brew. I crawled out of my bed, poured myself a bowl of Frute Chutes and started drinking my coffee. Afterwards, I went through the usual morning hygiene process, pulled on my slacks, white button up, wacky tie, and my black loafers and began my trek to work. Being incredibly rich and not blowing my money on luxuries is difficult, but I find it rather humbling. The money I make working for The Corporation I immediately give to charity. I don't need it. The money I had after my parents passed immediately went into a savings account and blew up to an exuberant amount a few years later. I couldn't access it until I was eighteen, but I never really needed it. My parents made sure of that. The only reason I work for The Corporation is to hide how much I really have. I'll continue letting the world think that the richest person is Bill Gates, or whoever it is. For now, I'll maintain my simple life.\n\nWhen I arrive to work, I immediately get an email from my boss the moment I punch in. He wants to see me in his office. Probably to offer me that promotion again. I keep telling him I don't want it. As I walk down the hall to his office, I notice my coworkers give me dodgy looks. Clearly, something's wrong.\n\n\"You wanted to see me sir?\" I ask.\n\n\"Yes, sit down. We need to talk about your performance as of late.\" Mr. Baus says.\n\n\"Sir, if it's about the promotion, I haven't change my mind. I still don't want it.\"\n\n\"You have one thing right, it is about the promotion. But I'm no longer offering it to you. Because of your lack of interest in moving up, I've decided you need to move out. Your fired. I always thought you were an excellent worker, but clearly you don't care about this company or your position in it. Please, gather your things and get out. If you're not gone within the hour, I'll call security.\"\n\nI sat, shocked, stunned, befuddled. I did so much for The Corporation. I'm getting fired for not wanting to move up the ladder? I'll show him. He'll regret the day he crossed me.\n\nI stormed out of the office, grabbed my things from my cubicle, and immediately left the building. I decided to walk home instead of calling a Ryde to pick me up. Gave me time to plan my revenge. Mr. Baus has no clue the amount of money I have and the expenses I'm willing to pay to make his life a living hell. I'll start by getting a PI to learn everything about him. Non-lethal allergies, the worst pet peeves, etc. I will constantly cause him stress and minor pain. He'll never know it was me. Everything that happens will seem like a minor inconvenience, but all together it will be the perfect revenge. I think, while I research a good PI, I'm going to let out all the air from Baus's tires. Not slash them, no, then he'd just get them replaced. I want him to put forth the effort of refilling his tires himself. Let the revenge plan begin...",

I mean, I have everything I could ever want and more, but I can\u2019t let anyone know that it\u2019s mine. What\u2019s the point of getting limited edition, carbon fiber, diamond encrusted Heelys if no one is around to see me use them!?\n\nBefore I became a billionaire, I was working a shitty little office job. Long, boring hours. Lazy co-workers. And one hard-ass boss. God, I hated that guy. Always yelling and screaming. Making me be his errand boy. Getting pissy whenever the coffee I made him wasn\u2019t the \u201cright temperature.\u201d\nThe moment I made my fortune, I promised myself I\u2019d never do that trivial nonsense ever again. But there I was, back in that same tiny cubicle. My management team told me it would be better if I took my old job back. No one would suspect that the guy who begged for his office gig back could secretly be able to buy a small country. \n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous. A wonderful, rich dude like you shouldn\u2019t need to hide his lifestyle.\u201d Well, I\u2019ll tell ya what. A lot of people want you dead when they realize you have money. After my first cohort of  \u201cfriends\u201d pooled their money together to put a hit on me; I learned it\u2019s better to keep your circle small. And by the way, I paid that hitman ten times what they were going for. Whoever said actions speak louder than words have never spoken to my man Ben Franklin. \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk business. Word around the street is you have a dog. And that you care an awful lot about it. Am I correct? With my contacts and resources, I can make your canine companion practically immortal. \n\nI\u2019m no stranger to revenge myself, but I figure it would be better to consult an expert. \n\nSo, Mr. Wick, what do you think would be the best course of action to make that asshole regret the day he fired me!?\n",

We could build or destroy entire countries, Hell, entire *religions* for fun. Do you know *how* much money it would take to do that?  More than you could count in a lifetime. More than you could fathom. And that was less than half a percent of what we had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo they came up with rules, simple rules, to keep us safe from the world and the world safe from us. Passed down from generation to generation that were to be obeyed at all costs as cousin Jack found out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rule 1:** You were not to use your family name, secret position or your inherited wealth flippantly. None of this \"Don't you know who I am?\" crap or buying and selling things for fun or annoyance.  You could only pull it only with what you had made or earned yourself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Uncle Herb, who had earned his way into a C Suite position at a major tech company? Yeah. he had his own wealth and reputation and could say it if her chose.  Cousin Jack, the drop kick son from his second wife? He tried to pull it in high school after getting rejected for both a starting position in the football team and a date with the hottest girl in school. Financially cut off, barred from contacting any of us again on pain of death and taken away to God knows where.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rule 2:** You were to attend at LEAST 2 years in a public high school then could transfer to private. The family seemed to learn two very different lessons from this. Either \"Don't become this\" or \"Understand your fellow man, and these will be your best friends.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rule 3:** Immediately upon graduating high school we were to have a gap year fully funded by our familial wealth. We could do what we wanted, go where we wanted, bring our friends if we liked. A year to indulge or experience anything and everything. To get it out of our systems in a way that would be unlikely to raise eyebrows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rule 4:** Upon completion of College or Trade School we were given 1 million to start and last us for life. No more public hand outs. And only if within a year we complied with Rule 5, otherwise we had to pay it back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rule 5:** We had to work out in the real world. Start at the bottom, earn our way up. Get an idea of how work was supposed to function ... or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rule 6**  You could tell only your children about your legacy on their 15 birthday, to pass the knowledge down to them, to prepare them, to train them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot everyone in the family reacted the same. Some decided to live the life of rich jet setting socialites, always chasing summer with equally shallow friends and hangers on, never amounting to or doing much and finding themselves dissatisfied and alone. Some decided to live life ordinary, work normal jobs and even face \"normal worries\", refusing the family money for anything other than emergencies and education. And some who wanted to make it in the world themselves, that craved the spotlight and not hiding in the shadows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then there was me. I lived a comfortable life. I still saw my friends from school and college often. They knew my \"parents were wealthy and owned my apartment\" (it explained the fancy fit out, great location and no flatmates)  but besides that expected me to make it on my own. The reality is I chose to work because it gave me motivation. I liked being able to relate to my friends and have something to bitch about at happy hour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe frequently debated what type of bad boss was the worst. They were convinced a jerk elevated to power, no matter how slight, was the worst. I disagreed. They remembered and *knew* their power could be taken away and were careful to wield it so it wouldn't get taken away. I argued the worst was one born into power, who has never seen the work behind it. It was their divine right and they knew nothing else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was, sadly, proven right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy direct supervisor was a real Karen type. Liked to drop work on us last minute, time our breaks down to the second and be a real pain in the ass. Annoying but sad. My best friend, Amy also worked under her and we'd both roll our eyes and get on with it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe real problem was the new division supervisor. Chet. or \"Chet Harrington, MBA. Harrington like the Company President.\" As he introduced himself and he was every bit as wanky and pretentious as his first name suggested. He hit on every female under 30,  defered to the 20 year old male intern, frequently asked us to get him coffee, do his filing and other tasks not even close to what we did. Not to crap on office support workers, they are the back bone of a good company, but what would I as a IT help desk tech know about filing or photocopies? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the straw that broke the camels back? A promotion came up for team lead under Karen but still a step up. I applied. It would have looked weird not to as one of the most senior people there. Chet interviewed myself and Dale, another tech for the position. Nothing against Dale, he's a great guy. But my interview was being held after his on a Friday afternoon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDale didn't step out of the office until 5:37pm, long after everyone else had left. We did support for banks and other 9-5 businesses so had no need to stay outside those hours normally. Just Chet and myself in his office. The questions quickly turned from work related to personal to \"OMG, Lawsuit!\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe wanted me to sleep with him. He did not want to take no for an answer so instead got a slap and a knee to the balls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You little bitch! Don't you know who I am? You're going to regret this. You are FIRED and I'll personally make sure no-one ever hires you for ANYTHING again.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like a plan, Chet. It sounds like a plan.",

                    "comment": "First things first. I call the company HR, \"crying\" (thank you high school drama club) about what Chet did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called through the work phone on the special HR line where \"all calls are recorded for quality and training purposes.\" I copy it and send it to my \"personal\" email. A simple gmail. But from there I can send it on to my real email and onto my lawyers email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI call my special people. I has already asked for a background on Chet and his entire family and now it was time to find out what was uncovered. And it was a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was going to be fun, but I wanted to make it more painful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirstly I had my lawyer call and claim they were from the firm that initially represented Emily Johnston - Chets mother who was screwed in her divorce. Telling her that they had reason to believe there was fraud in the paperwork and she is entitled to half of the wealth instead of the nothing she got before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext I had my team contact the women that all filed reports against both men and asked if they'd be willing to share their stories? if we paid for them for an \"Investigative journalism\" piece. See the statute to file for most of these had passed but he media and public opinion had no such timelines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made sure that Chet would be caught running a red light. It took a few days to get the system updated to my software patch and to change the patrol routes and assignments so I cop would be on speeding duty where Chet would pass by like he does every morning. I made sure the system flagged his 7 DWI/DUIs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy associates made sure there were some interesting looking syringes found when his car was searched, as of course he would be belligerent about the light being green not red. He lost his car, his license and had to go to court. I made sure a judge NOT in his daddy's pocket and known for being tough on rich people was assigned to the case. Threw the book at him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then I dropped the bombs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmily Johnston suing for half the company and winning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of the allegations of tax fraud and skimming coming out against Everett Harrington AKA Chet's daddy. Everett was fired by the board while an investigation was carried out and what do you know? Chet was implicated too!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey also found my call to HR which was covered up by the big boss himself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen we released the story of all the women who had been hushed up or had their reports swept under the rug.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll while Chet was in jail and powerless to help his daddy or clear his name.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also paid to make sure that Chet never had a matching pair of shoes in prison. The left one was always one size too big and any inmate who refused to swap shoes was given credit in the store and extra privileges - like moving out to the trial prison we had upstate which was modelled after the European rehabilitative ones. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo such transfer for good behaviour for Chet though. Not with all the extra charges he was facing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLost his car, his job, his ability to make future earnings, his family's money and made to pay for his crimes and as a bonus bringing his dirt bag dad to justice. Not a bad result. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd Emily Johnston took over the company and lead us to greater heights. It's amazing what paying decent wages, healthcare, hiring people who understand their jobs AND the jobs of the people they manage can do for a business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDale got that promotion but I took Karen's position once she was let go for performance issues. Emily selected me herself. Said she had a good feeling that I was the cause of the change. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think she meant that I had reported the phone call and asked my \"journalist friend\" to take my story. She has no idea how it was all me.",

            "comment": "People think they know what real power means. They think that because their parents gave them some high ranking job in a bank or a government office that they can just go around pushing over everybody. That\u2019s where I come in. I like to think of myself as something of a modern age Robin Hood. Only if Robin Hood was a billionaire man in the world and used connections rather than a wooden bow. \n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking \u201cwho the hell is this dude\u201d or \u201cyou probably just inherited your money from your family so why the hell are you crapping on other people\u201d. Well in that case I think a little backstory is in order. I\u2019m the world\u2019s youngest self made billionaire. I wasn\u2019t a poor person beforehand, I had been born into a relatively well off family. Never had to think about food or clothes, but we weren\u2019t exactly rich either. We were what you would call middle class. During college, I met some entrepreneurs. They came from rich families and had god connections. I proposed to them a business idea of an online book store called amazon. However mid way through I decided to take my share of the money and leave the company. I had never appeared in any media coverage so no one really knew me, but Jeff and George were good guys so I let them get some recognition. That was when I was 20. Fast forward ten years and some good investments later, my money has increased by more than ten fold. More importantly though, I now have shares in some of the most powerful companies on the planet. \n\nWhen I turned 35, I found life to be extremely mundane. You would think a billionaire\u2019s life would be interesting, but none of it is real. You\u2019re surrounded by fake friends, unhealthy habits, and always worrying about your public image. That\u2019s when I decided to move to Scotland. No one knew me there, but I decided to change my name anyways. I wanted to go back to the life I had in my childhood. I liked the simplicity of it all. I rented a small apartment in the city and applied for an entry level marketing job. I decided to leave out all my accomplishments from the resume and leave only my bachelor\u2019s degree. It wasn\u2019t easy explaining what I\u2019ve been doing all those years though. Anyways. I got a job that wasn\u2019t so bad and made some true friends. We went to together to the bar each night and all in all it was a good time until ...\n\nIt was a chilly Friday morning, I didn\u2019t have time to make make breakfast so I just drank some coffee and left for work. I had a feeling this wasn\u2019t a good day and the old man who tried to tackle me on the underground wasn\u2019t a good omen either. I reached work and sure enough a note was waiting for me on the desk. I entered my boss\u2019s office. \n\u201cYou wanted to see me sir?\u201d \n\u201cYeah ... ummm ... sit down mark\u201d his tone wasn\u2019t settling \u201clook, I gotta be honest. You\u2019re terrible. You won\u2019t have a career in this and by this rate I doubt you\u2019re going to have a career any where. If I were you, I would just go work as a waiter or something and try to enjoy the rest of your lives\u201d. \n\u201cBut sir, I\u2019m the best employee here.\u201d It was true, so far my ideas have been the ones used the most in the final projects. I was a natural at this, after all I did do it before hand and that turned out pretty well. \nI put on a pretty good case for myself, but still all I got was \u201cyou\u2019re terrible\u201d. \n\nI left that room with only one thing on my mind: that son of a bitch is going down. The owners of the company I\u2019ve been working at were actually friends of mine, so I called them to inquire about my manager. Said I wanted him in my new enterprise and wondered how good he was. They were really surprised when I called about him, but after some nudging they told me he wasn\u2019t bad, but for some reason his team never completed a full year with him. But they gave it to him, he was a man of results, so they never questions his methods. I had a hunch of what was going on, but I had to make sure. \n\u201cDid he ever promote anyone?\u201d \n\u201cOnly once, but the guy wasn\u2019t that good\u201d \nThat made me certain. My third question really caught them off guard however. \n\u201cDo you have any job openings? I had always wanted to rejoin the game, but never had the chance, and I have actually just moved to Scotland as well\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019ll make you an opening\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s the story of how I had taken over his job as regional manager. Nobody understood what happened, but all they knew was that he had to leave the country and I was promoted, none of which was lies. I also had good connections in parliament. That was my second move. I hired some people to hack his computer, and the guy became a pedophile. Not only that, but conveniently the laws had just witnessed a surprise change that made pedophilia punishable with the same jail time as murder.\nAnd that\u2019s how one life destroying bastard had his life destroyed  \n\n",

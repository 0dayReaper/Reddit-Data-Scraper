            "comment": "The Clown opened his eyes.\n\nHe was hungry. It was dark. It was damp. It smelled of mildew and old water. And fear. That was there too. \n\nThe sleeping minds of his prey were prepared for his return. Those with greater shine had felt it first. But now everyone would know it. A little pressure behind their eyes when they were alone. A sensation of something skittering behind them when they were alone in the dark. They were prey, and prey knew when a predator was near. The collective unconscious was hushed, quiet as the jungle when every little bird knew there was a jaguar on the prowl.\n\nThe Clown smiled his toothy grimace. The jaguar was hungry.\n\nThe sewers were as he had remembered them. The refuse of the prey told him much about them. There were things he did not recognize, things of metal and plastic and glass. His greater mind apprehended their purpose as he observed them. Interesting. They could serve as a good portal through which to cultivate the fear of his chosen meal. \n\nThere were new sections of the sewers, and he found them as he skittered hither and yon. He grew familiar with the sights, sounds, and smells of the prey that walked unknowing above. They were ripe for the picking. They did not fear the shadows, but that would make it easier, in a way, now that there was something stalking them that was worthy of their fear.\n\nDays and nights went by and still the web of tunnels expanded. The humans had done everything within their power to eradicate every dark corner in which a monster could hide, thinking themselves safe. It was a delicious taste of false security. Some of them had even *lit* sections of his sewers.\n\nAnd in one section, someone dared to *live.* \n\nAt first he had been hesitant. Terrified, even. Their forms reminded him strongly of that *sk\u00f8lpadda.* The Turtle. **Maturin.** He squealed and cowered in a corner as the name rose, unbidden, to his mind and raked across his very being with talons of white-hot light. He waited until the pain subsided and re-emerged to stalk. Yes, they had terrified him with their forms, half-man, half... *that.* But they trafficked with a rat-man, which he had initially mistaken as a servant of the Crimson King... But no, these were something altogether different. They were on neither one side nor the other. They were *neutral.* And therefore... not dangerous.\n\nYes, they were strong. They had weapons, and they knew how to use them. But it hadn't been the slung stones of the children that had defeated him last time, it had been their *shine.* But these were dimwits, and even their rat master's shine was weak compared to those who had been his bane the last time. \n\nAnd so he stalked them. He preyed on them in their dreams, and he waited for the moment that he would strike, to reclaim the last corner of his home so that he would be the only being who inhabited it.\n\nHe smelled it even now, a dish that had not changed for some time. Pizza. He smirked. They were human enough. They knew fear. He had seen their uneasy glances into the shadows as they passed him. It was no longer their home. It was his.\n\nHe crept forward, stealing into their lair, slipping through the nether and out into the physical world again. They all slept, snoring. He could feel their sleeping minds. Four dim bulbs, and a fitful flame in a chamber at the end of the long, vaulted room. Brick and stone and plenty of room, a perfect fit to serve as their tomb. He smiled again, savoring the feeling of his teeth sliding out of his impossibly small mouth. The time was now.\n\nHe strode into the middle of the room and reached toward the minds of the four mutant children. They would die first, and then he would deal with their master.\n\nA light flickered on, and suddenly the chamber was bathed in incandescent yellow. The creatures were not asleep. Each sprung from its bed, wielding archaic weapons. The Clown's smile grew. This would be fun.\n\n\"Master Splinter!\" one of them yelled. \"He's here!\" There was no fear in his voice. He sounded... jocular.\n\nWhat? How could they have--\n\nThe door at the end of the hallway slammed open, the candleflame growing into a torchlight. He was greater than the Clown had anticipated. But still... Not enough. Not enough to stop the Clown. He grinned, his face splitting wider.\n\n\"Gross, dude!\" one of the mutants yelled, stepping back.\n\nThere was the fear. He felt it now, as his form took on a more macabre semblance. The fear was growing, and soon he would feast.\n\nThe door behind him slammed.\n\nWhat? There were only five. There was no other shine...\n\n\"Ah, my friend, it is good to see you,\" the rat said with an unbearable smirk, looking past the Clown. \"Here he is, as you suspected he would be.\"\n\nThe Clown turned, slowly, to find a simple man, standing in jeans and a soiled white T-shirt that read \"I drive the Takuro Spirit.\" He was lanky with tousled brown hair, and wore a shit-eating grin. He stood with his hand on a gun in a holster. He had no shine. He would not--\n\nThe man spoke with a strong New York accent.\n\n\"See the Turtle, ain't he keen.\"\n\nThe Clown shrieked as the radiant talons raked at his essence. What was this man? What was--\n\nThe man's arm blurred, and he held in his hand a huge revolver, shining steel with sandalwood grips. The Clown's vision was swallowed by that mammoth barrel, pointed directly between his eyes. At the center of that black abyss he saw a glint of copper... and *ka.* \n\nThe man--no, the Gunslinger--pulled back the hammer, and the click resonated through the chamber. No. Not that. Not *that* gun!\n\nThe Gunslinger smirked.\n\n\"All things serve the fuckin' Beam.\"",

Thrones was a mega hit in part because books 1-4 could be purchased for $20 in the box set. 4,000+ pages for that price is a steal.\n\nBut it's $60 for the cheapest box set and like $10 each individually.  It's steep for anyone looking to go the distance and seems to also keep libraries away from more copies. \n\nThe official most recent box set is $97 on sale 34% off regular $147.  \n\nIt's just obnoxious. And I know his history and views on pricing, but it kills the mass spread of the Tower series.",

It glosses over many of the details, as movies do of course, especially since it's a freaking 1100 page novel.\n\nI suggest reading the book, I read it once many years ago when I was in middle school, and once again when I heard of the movie. It was much better the second time around, since I actually payed attention, really great book.",

Some characters from one story appear tangentially (or more directly) in others, and The Dark Tower ties them all together narratively and cosmologically. It's not King's self-professed masterpiece (that he reserves for The Stand,) but it's one of the best series I've ever read. I cannot recommend it highly enough.\n\n",

This little short came more naturally to me than anything I've written in a long while. Maybe it was *ka.* :)",

Some characters from one story appear tangentially (or more directly) in others, and *The Dark Tower* ties them all together narratively and cosmologically. It's not King's self-professed masterpiece (that he reserves for *The Stand,*) but it's one of the best series I've ever read. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

Your intro was fantastic, but as soon as I read sk\u00f8lpadda, I fucking lost it. Seriously, at that one word, I was like you are either going to make it or break it, right fucking here.  And holy shit, you goddamned made it.\n\nAnd seriously, don't think I'm saying you're just copying King's style, you went beyond that. I think this is one of the best \"it's all related\" short stories from King's timeline I've ever read, and even if I hadn't picked up on all the references from innumerable rereads, this is a fucking Bango Skank of a story.  \n\nFor real, man (or woman, immense apologies if I've misjudged), you absorbed another universe and made it your own.  I haven't checked yet, but I really hope you've written more here. If you haven't, I would seriously encourage you to do so.",

            "comment": "After 27 years of sleep, Pennywise the clown arose from its slumber, hungry. Its feet sloshed through the water, the sound of its steps bouncing off the moss-infested stone walls. At the slightest disturbance, the bodies dangling above Pennywise shifted, some spilling three decades worth of bloody decay into the sewer. It inhaled the sour-sweet odor and frowned. None of these children had lasted long enough for a snack, which was fine. In Derry, Maine, children were served fresh.\n\nA padded footstep sounded down the sewer and Pennywise froze. It must\u2019ve been those kids, back to fulfill their promise. Pennywise faded into the shadows, its claws already out.\n\n---\n\nDonatello glanced at April. Her auburn hair spilled down slender shoulders, bobbing as she walked beside him. They were only going to pick up pizza, but he had made sure to wash up beforehand. Chances to go one on one with April didn\u2019t come frequently. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\nMichaelangelo walked at his other side spinning his nun chucks. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, stuffed crust is the way to go. Have you ever had stuffed crust? It\u2019s like a cheese pizza inside of a cheese pizza!\u201d\n\nApril rolled her eyes and smiled. \u201cI guess you\u2019ve never heard the word restraint?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I have,\u201d Michaelangelo said. \u201cMaster Splinter talks to me about it all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cMikey, the fact that Master Splinter has to keep telling you about it is proof enough that you don\u2019t get it,\u201d Donatello growled.\n\nHis orange-masked brother furrowed his brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s up your butt, Donnie? Your staff?\u201d\n\nApril giggled. Donatello clamped his mouth shut and picked up his pace. The sooner they could be done with this, the better.\n\n---\n\nPennywise tilted its head. Two overgrown turtles and a woman walked through its sewers. Strangely enough, the turtles seemed to be talking to each other. It crept from shadow to shadow, watching this scene unfold.\n\n\u201cWould you like to float too?\u201d it asked under its breath.\n\nThe orange-masked turtle, the one they called Mikey, stiffened. His nun chucks fell limp at his sides. \u201cGuys,\u201d he said, turning toward the shadows and squinting his eyes.\n\nOf course, he wouldn\u2019t see. Shadows containing Pennywise darkened. It nearly burst into laughter, watching a turtle trying to find it in the shadows.\n\n\u201cStop slowing us down,\u201d the turtle named Donnie huffed and walked ahead of him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t keep up, we\u2019re leaving you.\u201d\n\nMikey took one last look back before tearing his eyes away from the creeping shadows. \u201cOkay,\u201d he muttered and continued forward. Three fingers gripped tightly around his nun chucks.\n\nPennywise picked at its teeth. They weren\u2019t human, yet he could still smell their fears as if they were. Mikey and his fear of squirrelanoids and Donnie and his fear of the girl beside him\u2019s rejection. The edge of Pennywise\u2019s lips curled into a dagger\u2019s point. Its stomach rumbled.\n\nThey weren\u2019t children, but perhaps they could float too.\n\n---\n\nThe two turtles and April walked in silence. Mikey stopped cracking jokes. Donnie pressed his lips together. April held in a shiver. The only sound between them were the slap of webbed feet and clack of shoes\u2014sounds that echoed a bit too loudly.\n\nWith every passing step, though they walked toward the sun, the shadows encroached and the air became a bit more brittle. Nobody mentioned it, nor the sinking feeling in their stomach. It wasn\u2019t fear exactly, they were *unsettled*. It felt as if a single voice or jerky movement would tear apart the fragile peace and unleash something upon them.\n\nHowever, though they walked in perfect tempo, never mentioning the darkness, echoes, or coldness, Pennywise only advanced further. The shadows crept. The echoes loudened. And the air grew more still and cold than a corpse.\n\nThey walked until their footsteps sounded like gunshots and they could no longer even see their own hands in front of their faces. They had passed the sewer exit long ago, but nobody dared to stop walking. It was instinct.\n\nBut if ignoring the clown was all that took to stop it, IT would never have become the monster it now was. It smiled and took on the form of April\u2019s worst fears.\n\nApril stopped walking. She had heard a new sound, something besides their footsteps\u2014a flapping in the air, some squeaks. She listened closer and suddenly, the blood drained from her cheeks. Before she could stop herself, a shiver ran up her spine and she screamed. A colony of bats blasted past her, their wings beating upon her body, little teeth nibbling at any exposed skin.\n\n\u201cApril!\u201d\n\nShe couldn\u2019t even tell who screamed it. Everything was drowned out by the bats. Her legs moved on their own, pistoning her forward away from the creatures. Behind her, someone was still calling her name, but it was fading slowly into the distance as she took frantic rights and left, anything to escape the bats. She dashed through Derry, Maine\u2019s underground labyrinth, leaving behind only her screams.\n\nBy the time she stopped running, whoever was calling her name could not even reach her in echoes and the bats had disappeared, leaving her engulfed in a deafening silence. \n\nAnd a slight giggle.\n\n\"You can float too.\"\n\n---\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang for 200+ stories.\n",

            "comment": "It woke up slowly. It had not been in a gentle rest, but it had been floating at the top of the bodies of It\u2019s victims. Looking down, he saw them. Countless children, broken and torn apart, floating above the dirty, wet floor of the sewer. They were no longer fresh. 27 years had taken its toll on the bodies, which were now no longer appetizing to the creature. It smiled. It was time to feed again. \n\nIt slowly floated down to the bottom and composed itself. Times change, and he would need to adjust every time he awakened to feed. People became scared of different things, and he could never let go of his creativity for a moment. As he pondered the next location for the harvest, he heard a voice coming from above the sewer room. \n\n\u201cMikey!\u201d Raphael yelled. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get back here right now I\u2019m gonna beat you so hard-\u201d \n\nA creaking noise took away the 19 year old\u2019s attention. \n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\nAs he looked around, he saw nothing. He had been running through the sewers in search of his mischevious little brother, who had stolen his T-phone right as his Donatello had sent him a download file for the newest Charred Walls album. The album was scheduled to be released in two months, and he was determined to take advantage of his brother\u2019s hacking skills. As he walked further, there came a sinking feeling in his stomach that indicated something else was in the sewers.\n\n\u201cMikey?\u201d\n\nHe heard footsteps from below. \n\n\u201cWho are you? Come out and face me!\u201d He yelled, pulling out his sais and spinning them skillfully. \n\nAs he turned around, he saw his little brother standing in the corner. He noticed a hoard of large roaches surrounding Michaelangelo as they climbed up his body and forced themselves into his eyes. \n\n\u201cRaphael,\u201d the image of his brother said, \u201cPlease. Get them off of me. It hurts. It hurts.\u201d\n\nThe blood started trickling down his eyes as his face swelled. Slowly, the roaches began to tear through his body in an effort to escape from the inside out. \n\n\u201cWhat the heck? No! Not this again. I\u2019m not scared anymore! I'm not scared!\u201d Raphael yelled as he ran away from the image. But even as he ran, the death behind him did not stop. \n\n--------\n\nApril was sitting on her boyfriend\u2019s lap as she buried her face into his neck. She fell asleep as an episode of Space Heroes: The Next Generation played in the background.\n\n-----\n-----\n-----\n\n\u201cCaptain Ryan!\u201d The young man shrieked, \u201cthe Omegathons had taken over the ship and we\u2019ve lost control of everyone on board! What are we going to do!?\u201d\n\nThe older man slapped him across the face.\n\n\u201cCalm yourself. There is still HOPE left. All we have to do is believe in the power of courage. \n\nA large, neon colored leprechaun appeared on front of them and shrieked. The man was not afraid. \u201cEvil Omegathon, you will not take control of\u2026\u201d Captain Ryan\u2019s voice trailed off. \n\n\u201cCaptain Ryan!\u201d \n\nThe older man lost the color in his eyes. He looked at the younger man and gave a warning: \u201cThere is no hope young one. Soon you will give into the power of-\u201d\n\nDr. Mindstrong shot a laser beam into Captain Ryan\u2019s chest from behind.\n\nAs Captain Ryan layed on the floor of the spaceship, he looked up at him: \u201cYou\u2026 you have saved me Dr. Mindstrong. Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything for you Captain.\u201d Dr. Mindstrong said as he saluted him. Slowly, the giant Omegathon fit the captain\u2019s body into his mouth and chewed. \n\n----\n----\n----\n\n \u201cSo. Stupid.\u201d Donatello said as he laughed at the absurdity of his older brother\u2019s favorite anime. He noticed that April had fallen asleep and in response, he kissed her forehead and turned off the television. Moments alone with her were hard to come by, so he appreciated every one. \n\n\u201cGuys!\u201d Raphael came in yelling and breathing heavily. \n\n\u201cWell that lasted all of 12 minutes\u201d Donatello thought as April woke and stretched. \n\n\u201cI was in the hallways looking for Mikey and it happened again! I started imagining the swarms of roaches! They were all over him and-and they were eating him and he was bleeding and-\u201d Raphael stopped when he saw Michaelangelo walk out of his bedroom, T-phone in hand and headphones wrapped around his neck.\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d said Michaelangelo, \u201cI\u2019ve been in my room this whole time. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cMikey, you-you\u2019ve been here?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, yeah? Where else would I be?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2026 I thought\u2026 wait, I saw you out there. You took my phone and ran off.\u201d Raphael looked down just as he finished his sentence and saw his T-phone was still tightly attached to his belt. \n\nDonatello looked worried. \u201cOh no, the mushrooms are back?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Said Raphael. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t them. This was more terrifying. It was stronger. It was someONE, or, or someTHING.\u201d \n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re right Raph\u201d said April. \u201cI can sense it. Some single body is hiding in the sewers. It\u2019s alone, but, it\u2019s not a person.\u201d\n\nMichaelangelo knew what Raphael was talking about. But he was too afraid to bring it up in that moment.\n\n---------------------------\n\nThe four turtles, Casey, Karai, and April gathered in the kitchen and discussed the predator. \n\n\u201cI heard about this urban legend from Maine. From this website I found about strange sightings, it tells about a weird clown that some people believe feeds on fear.\u201d\n\nA sketch of the monster from someone who claimed to had seem it showed up on the screen. Now Michaelangelo was very, very scared. \n\n\u201cOh man. Guys, something happened when I was in my bedroom.\u201d\n\n-------------------------\n\nMichaelangelo had been sitting in his bed listening to music with ice cream kitty when  he had heard a voice.\n\n\u201cMichaelangelo.\u201d The voice called.\n\n\u201cHuh? Leo?\u201d He responded. \n\n\u201cOver here.\u201d The clown called. \n\nMichaelangelo pinpointed where the voice was coming from. He looked up at the vent on the upper wall behind where he was sitting and stood up. \n\n\u201cHello?\u201d He called. \u201cUh, dude? You lost or somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi there Michaelangelo.\u201d It said to him.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 Hi there?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here all alone in this strange place?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my room man.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, what a strange place this is. Wouldn\u2019t you like to visit another, magical part of the sewers?\u201d\n\nIce Cream Kitty hissed at the creature. \n\n\u201cCool it, Ice Cream Kitty. Brah, this is the best part of the sewers! I got everything I need right here! My action figures, my comic book collection, what else could be more \u2018magical?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, if you come with me, I\u2019ll show you someplace with a whole room full of comic books. Every edition available of every series worth reading. And pizza. Do you like pizza?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you say pizza?\u201d Michaelangelo said. Suddenly, the strange clown peeking into his bedroom seemed a lot more interesting. \n\n\u201cOh, why yes. There\u2019s all kinds of pizza where I live. Pepperoni, Hawaiian, a jelly bean, anchovy, and jalapeno pizza\u2026\u201d  \n\n\u201cWoah! That\u2019s my favorite kind! Where\u2019s this pizza from?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, why from the best pizza place ever of course. Do you like Antonio\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cDude no way! How did you know Antonios was my favorite!?\u201d He said, stepping over the mountain of empty Antonio\u2019s pizza boxes to get closer to the vent. \u201cWait a sec, Antonios doesn't do Hawaiian\u2026 are you lyin\u2019 to me? Hey man! What\u2019s the deal?\u201d\n\nThe clown grew impatient and was about to reach out and grab the young mutant just as a loud voice was heard in the living room. \n\n\u201cWoah, is that Raph?\u201d Michaelangelo turned around. He then ran out, just missing the grip of the thing\u2019s clawed hands. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\u201cAre you sure this is the clown you saw in your room?\u201d Donatello asked.\n\n\u201cHeck yeah I\u2019m sure! He was a creep. Peeking into my bedroom and trying to lure me away with pizza and stuff. Good think I\u2019m smart though, I saw right through that.\u201d \n\nShinigami interjected immediately.  \u201cI know who this is. Friends, this is nothing like you are all used to. He is not a mutant. He is not a physical being. He is a creature unlike anything you are used to fighting, a mystical North American yokia who has been feeding on the fear and bodies of children for centuries. I fought him once as a child. My friends and I barely made it out. But if I face him again I know I can end it. With this.\u201d \n\nShe pulled out a small blade from a pocket in her hat. \u201cIt is a gift from a mystic I knew in Japan. If you are injured with this blade, you can no longer use your powers against others. Instead, they are all released at once. Against you. His spirit is not as strong as he seems. If we can reach him, I know he can die. Of fear.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____\n\nPart 2 coming up whether you want it or not cause I'm having way too much fun with this\n",

                    "comment": "Part 2:\n\n-------\n\nThe teenagers gathered their supplies. Casey Jones knew his electric weapons gave him a greater advantage in the sewers, where water was abundant and even a single puddle can become a deathtrap. Donatello knew that this creature, this, THING, would take advantage of the dark corners in the sewer, and so he brought his updated night vision equipment. Karai tasted her venom slightly before grabbing her signature weapon: a short, red-handled sword. The rest of them all brought the weapons that they were the most comfortable with, but Shinigami almost began to feel afraid about the powerful weapon she had only ever considered using until now. But she had to summon her courage. It was the creature\u2019s feeding time.\n\nThe group walked down the sewer halls, listening carefully to any sound that may appear among the trickling drops of sewer water and the scurrying of rats. \n\n\u201cThis is straight uncool,\u201d Casey Jones said. \u201cOut if all of the things in this world we had to fight, we have to fight a clown? Come on. Casey Jones can take on way stronger opponents!\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this the guy you said was afraid of rats?\u201d Shinigami whispered to Karai. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get overconfident Casey. Underestimating your opponent is always risky. We don\u2019t know how strong this thing is.\u201d Leonardo replied.\n\n\u201cWell you don\u2019t seem so scared, tough guy.\u201d Raphael said to Leonardo as he gave him a slight shove. \n\nA small yellow piece of fabric caught Michaelangelo\u2019s attention. \u201cHold on guys,\u201d he called to the others. He noticed the white printing on the shirt wrote out the number five. \n\n\u201cHey April,\u201d Michaelangelo said, \u201cthis looks just like your shirt.\u201d\n\nApril instinctively looked down to see what shirt she had been wearing. She saw that her typical yellow and white jersey was covered in countless pairs of tiny holes. \u201cWhat the, what happened to my shirt?\u201d\n\nShe felt a sharpness coming from all over her torso and began to groan in pain. \n\n\u201cApril! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Donatello asked\n\nApril lifted up her shirt and saw that the tiny holes covered her chest and back in the exact same positions. Slowly, they began oozing blood. \n\n\u201cApril\u2026\u201d Donatello said. \u201cYou\u2019re covered in some kind of bites.\u201d\n\nThen she heard the familiar screech of bats growing louder and louder as the sound travelled in from around the corner. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re-they\u2019re bat bites. Guys they\u2019re coming. They\u2019re coming! Donnie!\u201d She began to scream hysterically as she wrapped her arms tightly around him and closed her eyes. \n\n\u201cApril, it\u2019s ok!\u201d He said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any bats down here, I promise.\u201d\n\nA large black figure arose from behind him. April let go and ran as fast as she could into a part of the sewers she didn\u2019t realize she was unfamiliar with. Her friends ran after her, failing to keep up.\n\nAs she ran further and further away she noticed a crawlspace near the ceiling of the sewers. She considered hiding there for a moment before a pale hand grabbed her by the hair and pulled her in. \n\n\n-------\n\n\u201cApril! April! Where are you?\u201d Her friends cried out as they searched. But she was nowhere to be found. \n\n\u201cUgh, didn\u2019t this happen last time?\u201d Casey said. \n\n\u201cQuiet, Jones.\u201d Donatello snapped. He had always been extra overprotective of April, though he knew she never needed his protection, but this time he began to feel genuinely afraid. This was the only time that he and some of the others had been up against something they had never laid eyes on. \n\n\u201cDude, April really needs to learn how to chill sometimes.\u201d \n\nWhen they turned the corner, they saw her. And they saw It. \n\n\u201cApril!\u201d Donatello cried.\n\n\u201cDonatello.\u201d April replied coldly. She stared at him with indifference. Her eyes were glowing bright white, just as they had all seen her eyes glow many times before. It was because of this that they did not realize how she had been effected by the deadlights. \n\n\u201cYou. Let her go. NOW!\u201d Leonardo yelled to the clown. \n\n\u201cOh? What do you mean Leonardo? Come, come here, boy.\u201d It replied.\n\n\u201cApril! It\u2019s ok. We\u2019re here to save you!\u201d Michaelangelo told her. \n\n\u201cFrom what?\u201d April said in a low, monotonous voice. \n\n\u201cFrom that thing!\u201d Michaelangelo replied.\n\n\u201cI want.... to float.\u201d She said.\n\n\u201cApril, what are you saying?\u201d Donatello replied.\n\n\u201cGuys, I\u2019ll float. We can all float down here. You can all float too. We\u2019ll float.\u201d \n\n\u201cFloat? Like, levitate? You\u2019re already able to do that, Red, what\u2019s goin\u2019 on with you?\u201d said Casey.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d Donatello charged at the creature with his bladed bo. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d\n\n\u201cI took her.\u201d It growled. \n\nThe creature\u2019s eyes shined yellow and his mouth doubled in size, revealing multiple rows of long, sharp teeth. \n\nApril floated higher and higher into the mass of rotten children. Some of the bodies, the teenagers noticed, were fresh. \n\n\u201cNinjas, attack!\u201d  The leader cried. \n\nThey all charged at once, skillfully evading every hit and striking every blow possible into the monster. As he transformed into a squirrelanoid, Michaelangelo barely flinched. As he vomited hoards of roaches, Raphael barely screamed. \n\nHe had one last shot with the beautiful kunoichi with the red around her eyes. He looked into the piercing hazel and saw the image that had horrified her the most in her life. Her mother\u2019s killer. The man who killed the turtles\u2019 father. \n\nAnd he knew, at that moment, that he has one more chance at tasting their fears.  \n\nHis clown outfit transformed into a metal armor and his skin became a mosaic of heavily burned skin.\n\n\u201cKarai.\u201d His powerful voice threatened. \u201cYou. Will. PERISH!.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand people as well as you think you do.\u201d She forced her sword through his throat. \n\nNow heavily weakened, they pinned him down. \n\nThe creature was not there when Donatello looked down at the body he was holding. Instead, he saw a beautiful girl with red hair and piercing blue eyes. \n\n\u201cDisgusting.\u201d She said. \u201cYou\u2019re an abomination. You make me sick. You vile, horrendous creature. Don\u2019t you dare touch me! Don\u2019t touch me!\u201d She screamed, loud enough for her veins to bulge unnaturally.\n\nHe smiled. \u201cSorry, clown. We\u2019re canon.\u201d\n\nShinigami plunged the blade as deep into the girl\u2019s heart as she could. It slowly transformed into the clown once again. \n\nThey watched as the clown shrieked and convulsed on the floor as tears ran down it\u2019s eyes. \n\n\u201cNo! No!\u201d It screamed. \u201cNO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.\u201d\n\nLittle by little, the screams grew intolerably loud. The clown grew skinny and emaciated. Suddenly, the clown vomited. Red liquid and bodily tissues flooded the floor of the sewers. A string of black entrails followed, stuffing the monsters mouth as it slowly suffocated. \n\nCasey Jones couldn\u2019t take his excitement. \u201cSo. Rad.\u201d\n\nDonatello was the first to take off and reach April\u2019s feet, pulling her down. As the clown took it\u2019s last breath, she succumbed to the forces of gravity and was no longer weightless. \n\n\u201cApril, are you ok?\u201d Donatello asked as he held her. Slowly she opened her eyes. \n\n\u201cGuys,\u201d she asked, \u201cis it gone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s probably dead.\u201d Replied Karai. \u201cToo bad. He was actually the closest thing to a challenge I\u2019ve seen in months.\u201d\n\n\nThe group was too preoccupied with celebrating their victory to notice the floating corpses had also been levitating downwards. All at once they fell with a loud \u201csplat\u201d as the bodies hit the ground with a slightly explosive impact, leaving the sewer room floor littered with bodily remains. \n\nCasey Jones revelled in the delicious horror. \u201cSO. RAD.\u201d\n\n----\n\n-End-",

            "comment": "It awoke. The past 2 awakenings had been bad. Those children nearly killed It. They had driven It into the outer darkness from whence It came. But It was tied to the land now, after all these millenia, and death of Its physical form wouldn't keep It at bay forever. It was so weak, and needed to feed. First insects. The tiny neuron bursts as it ripped their legs and wings off gave It strength, but It was like drops of water to a man dying in the desert. Next, came the rats. They had a weak fear that It was able to eat, but they, and the cat he managed to lure into the sewer, only whetted his appetite. It needed something that could truly understand what It was. Finally, It was ready to go after its favorite prey. The giant creatures that had walked the earth had been good eating, but were too slow and stupid to truly enjoy. It had bided its time for countless ages, waiting\u2026 waiting for sentience. Waiting for a consciousness that could truly know It for what It was. Know It, and fear. All the better that the tastiest meals had no claws, or sharp teeth, nor a powerful Shine to defend themselves with. \n\nIt slunk through the sewers with a fluid grace; part of the shadows themselves. It sensed something in this part of the sewer. Not rats, nor some other large animal that decided to make this its home. No, these things had thoughts. It could sense them. Smell them like a man would smell freshed baked bread. This thing was underdeveloped. The immature mind made it all the sweeter. Maybe a little older than the truly young that It liked to prey upon, but It was capable of taking down creatures great and small. It formed a body from the Void that was Its domain, and crept closer\u2026 \n\n\u201cPsst. Hey kid\u201d It whispered. \nThe thing turned around. It wasn't like anything It had ever seen before. A green face, looking like something from days long past, when giant reptiles roamed Its domain. But this thing\u2026 this thing walked on two legs like men, and was wearing a long brown coat to cover its body. Strange, indeed, but It had never seen a thing It couldn't eat, and It was HUNGRY. Forming words and images stolen straight from the creatures mind, It set the trap.\n\n\u201cHey, Mikey! I was supposed to deliver a pizza down here, but I can't find who it belongs to. Do you want it?\u201d\n\n\u201cFree pizza? Radical!\u201d The thing had a sense of trust that It found delicious. Trust betrayed created a fear so sweet, it was hard to think of anything else. \n\n\u201cSure, Mikey. An extra-extra-large supreme with triple cheese, hold the anchovies. Come get it. All you want...\u201d\n\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d The creature came over, but slowed. It could sense a small, but growing suspicion in the thing. \n\n\u201cWait a second\u2026 How did a pizza delivery guy get in the sewer?\u201d Pondered the green thing. It searched the creature's surface thoughts for an explanation. \n\n\u201cFast Eddy's Pizza opened a new store down here. Don't you want your pizza? Come oooon\u2026. It's getting coooold.\u201d it crooned\n\nThis seemed to make up its mind, and it reached into the shadows to grab the box. In a flash, It grabbed for the things arm. Only to grab\u2026 air? In an instant, several things happened at once. It tried to attack the creature's Shine, to drive its fear up into terror. A creature panicked was always easy prey. It's attack, however, bounced off of something. Like its shine was protected by... a shell? At the same time, Its hand was wrapped up in a strange device: two sticks connected by a chain locked Its hand. It pulled back with all the strength that Its corporeal form could muster, but this thing was STRONG! It pulled back with equal force. Nothing was stronger than It when It wanted to be, though. It added muscle and power to Its arm, and prepared to yank the creature into Its mouth, when out of the darkness, a blade flashed. Its arm came loose, severed at the shoulder. It gave a scream of rage, as 3 more of the creatures materialized out of the darkness, all carrying primitive weapons. \n\n\u201cFoolish creatures!\u201d It spat. \u201cYou dare to hunt me? The eater of worlds? The hunter of hunters? I will devour your souls, and digest them for centuries to come!\u201d\n\nThe one with a red mask replied. \u201cYeah, yeah. Great and terrible. We've heard it before. You've been creeping around our sewers for too long already. Enough with the threats, let's make with the fighting\u201d. \n\nIt began to change forms, cycling though from fear to fear. These creatures were too quick, though. Whenever It would turn to attack one, the other 3 would attack It from behind. They always seemed to be open to an attack, but they were never where It expected them to be when It hit. It gave a roar of frustration. It was too weak to overpower these things until It had fed more deeply. It began to shift back to the Void, to come up with a plan to destroy these foul things, when a fifth creature came into Its view. It was like the rats that It had eaten, but large, and it walked like a man. The creature's Shine was strong. Too strong! The thing threw salt in Its face and shouted worlds in a language It had not heard before. \n\n\u201cAkujin! Watashi wa anata o kono basho ni shibaru!\u201d The salt burned like fire, and the words rang through It like a great bell had sounded.\nSuddenly, It was stuck in this realm. It could sense the Void, but it was like a pane of glass had been placed between It and the Void. \n\n\u201cNo nononono!\u201d It screamed. \u201cWhat are you foul creatures!?\u201d \n\nThe one in the orange mask stopped and said \u201cWe're teenagers!\u201d\n\nThe one in red spun his weapons and said \u201cWe're mutants\u201d\n\nThe one in purple crouched low with its stick and said \u201cWe're ninjas\u201d\n\nThe one in blue smiled and shouted \u201cWe're TUUURTLLLEEES!\u201d\n\nTurtles! And a Rat! It could see now. Maturin finally had It cornered. It fought savagely, melting into Its true form, an unspeakable thing of legs, claws, teeth and eyes. Spider and serpent, and other unholy things combined onto an abominable killing machine. Its rage fuelled It, but the turtles were too much for It. They were as much a part of the shadows as It was; born to the fight, and working together as only brothers could. As It lay, broken and bleeding the foul ichor that served as Its blood, the rat walked up to It in a stately manner. \n\n\u201cDemon, if I sent you back to where you came from, you'd only come again. So here you will remain. And your death will not be an honorable one.\u201d His walking stick, carved with unusual ideographs, blazed with light as he drove the point through Its head. \n\n\u201cMaster Splinter\u201d Michelangelo said \u201cCan we get some pizza now? Being monster bait makes me hungry!\u201d. \n\nSplinter smiled and replied calmly \u201cMichelangelo, everything makes you hungry. Now lets go call Fast Eddy's. I want one with cheese.\u201d\nThe four brothers jumped into the air with a shout of \u201cCowabunga!\u201d and they raced off towards home.\n",

            "comment": "Great shadow\u2019s began to form over Derry once more. Big dark things gathering like storm clouds on the horizon or monsters come up from under the bed. Lesser evils could sense the change coming like rain on the wind and reacted in kind.  Ka is a wheel that keeps turning, and evils time had come once again. \n\nMany miles away in the greatest city this land had ever known creatures of the dark had begun reacting to the change. Those many mindless things that skitter and slither through the dark and the damp had simply been driven mad by it, coming out of their holes to attack the unwary creatures of the light. However those more mindful minions of the dark could feel themselves being drawn towards the sewers of some far off place. This year was special, this wakening was going to be different, they could feel it. And so they slunk out of their homes leaving the city in the chaos of the lesser creatures to seek that dark blot on the horizon calling out to them. \n\nSplinter looked despondently up at the clouds listening to the distant cries and wail of sirens carried to him by the wind. It wasn\u2019t fair. Maturin\u2019s grandchildren had only just reached their nineteenth summer and he had nearly a century of training under his belt before he had been called up to protect his side of the beam. But time had run out. He had been feeling the quakes for months, tremors from the East shaking him out of his sleep and stealing away his breath in the night. Something ancient, evil and hungry was drawing near, threatening everything they had been born to protect. He knew more than he wished of evil and its ways, and had raised his boys in the dark and damp places evil liked to dwell, trained them to act as one, and Gan willing, they would prevail. \n",

            "comment": "A raucous sound reverberated throughout the sewers. To say that 'It' had woken up would not be entirely grounded in reality. Its consciousness was omnipresent in the sewers It called home, but no threats would ever present themselves that It would deem worthy of investigation.\n\nUntil now.\n\nIt knew there were still three more months before It had to next awaken, but It was now here. And It was hungry.\n\n# ... #\n\nHis own footfalls echoed throughout the sewers around him. There was a rumble deep within the confines of the sewer and Raphael looked above him at the arched ceiling of his home. He sighed and brushed off a rogue spec of shit upon the sight of stalactites of human defecation dropping down all around him. He grunted, pulled his coat up to his neck and hunched his shoulders, and continued walking forward, sloshing his way through the grey water that would plague his feet for the rest of his life. He just wanted to get away from it all: the sewers, his master, his incessantly annoying brothers, even April became a drag for him. So he started to walk. For how long, he couldn't remember. He just started walking because something compelled him to. \n\nLooking above he could see manhole covers letting in small streams of light, enough to pave the path ahead of him. There were three paths ahead, straight forward, right, and left. He mulled over the paths that presented themselves to him for a few moments (they were the only interesting thing that happened to him anymore, so he tried to entertain himself as much as he possibly could with the temporary diversions) before deciding to take the right path.\n\n'Raph?'\n\nHe stopped dead in his tracks.\n\n'Ralph. Why'd you leave, bro?'\n\nRaphael turned around and pushed out his hand in an accusatory point towards his brother, before turning into an open palm pushing away the spectral image that resided ten feet in front of him.\n\nThey were all dead. All of them. April, Splinter, Mikey, Donny, Leo. All of them. Dead. Or dying. He couldn't tell. His eyes shot open wider than they already had been and focused on the drooping and sagging flesh that fell off of them in bloody bags. He could smell them. Christ. He could /smell/ them. He heard their ragged breath. He heard the creaking of their broken bones. The tired groans each of them exhibited when they moved. They shambles closer to him, calling his name. \n\nPanic's grip let go of Raphael's conscience and he turned to run and saw his family again. Closer this time. The smell was stronger. He could see them clearer. Donatello reached out and touched his brother's forearm, leaving behind a black oil mark that slid its way down and dropped to the floor. A sickening hissing sound, and Raphael's arm was alight with a fire, though there was no light.\n\nHe wiped the acid off of his arm and saw the fair skin he revealed. He looked at the palm of his hand that was now covered in some of the ooze as well and shook it off, only to reveal finger pads. Soft and vulnerable. With a glance of terror, he looked back at his brothers only to see their mouths opened so far that their cheeks tore and revealed the darkest depths of their throats. Black goo sprayed out of their mouths coating his entire body, going in his mouth, securing itself around his midsection. Burning. Stinging. Killing.\n\nHe screamed, and blindy swung his fist, only to make contact with a cloth-like substance. He wiped his eyes and prepared to swing his other fist, only to see the torso of a man who was seven feet tall. Three orange pom-poms, white frills, blue sleeves. Big red clown shoes. He looked up to see the smiling face of a clown. He almost smiled for a second, until the clown's mouth opened up, revealing row after row of razor sharp teeth.\n\nHe tried to scream. But by the time that he would have willed his vocal chords into usage, Raphael was no more. Pennywise devoured every last piece of Raphael and savored the taste of pure fear. He'd been so easy to manipulate, it was almost boring. The taste made up for it, he thought to himself. There was an echo of laughter and the soft sound of skateboard wheels on concrete resonating throughout the sewers. It whipped its head toward the sound, entrails running down Its face, blood covering the red plastic smile he kept. It wiped Its mouth, and smiled. Today was a good day to start his hunt.\n\n\n\nSo that was my first story on this sub. I'd love it if you guys could give some constructive criticism on it. King's one of my favorite authors and It is by and far my favorite book, so this was a joy to write. Thanks, all! ",

This is going to be the biggest turtle stew he has attempted.  The rat kebabs will be a perfect appetizer and more than enough to go around.   Bozo, Emmett Kelly, and Grock will be so impressed by this scrumptious feast they will not hesitate to let Pennywise be an instructor at the Guild of Fools and Joculators and College of Clowns, perhaps even allowing Captain Spaulding to be an assistant.   All those years of finishing off that subconscious doctorate are going to pay off in a big way.  ",

            "comment": "Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael finally hit the best part of their day, pizza time. The Ninja turtles chowed down in a flurry of cheese crust and discarded pizza boxes. Once they had run out, they paused for a satisfactory breath... Ahhh... Then a faint chuckle bounced off the cement sewer walls. \"What the heck was that?\" Raphael questioned. \"Probably just my stomach!\" Donatello chimed. Laughs and high fives spread all around. Then it happened again, this time sounding like a child, no, it was something more evil, something with deep mockery and wretchedness. Splinter awoke from his meditation advising the turtles, \"I hoped this day wouldn't come.\" A muttering of qeustions rose, then splinter continued, \"This can only be IT.\" \"What?\" The turtles said in unison. \"This can only be a being from decades ago that preys using fear. The worst part is he was rumored to claim these sewers as his domain. You must defeat him before he kills countless victims.\" The Ninja turtles leaped into action grabbing sai, bo, nunchaku, and twin katanas. Mere seconds later a grinning clown poked his head outside the sewer gate the turtles used as their exit. \"Hello I'm Pennywise the dancing clown,\" he said with  cheerful demonic emotion. The turtles charged with great speed, but pennywise was not of this world, poof he was gone. \"Where has that devil gone?\" Asked Michelangelo. Then suddenly the TV flipped on, first static, then fox news. \"It seems an epidemic has plagued the world today. All pizza parlors from the smallest street vendor to the most famous Chicago deep dish have gone out of business. The sauces used round the world have been poisoned, be warned all who eat it will surly die.\" The images they showed next we're absolutely terrifying. People would take a bite only to have there eyes pop out of their skulls, and blood erupt from their eyes and mouth. Sputter, choke, sputter, and then death of thousands. All the turtles were frozen their greatest fear had materialized, world without pizza. \"I would rather die, than live in a hell of earth with no cheesy goodness or meaning.\" As if some force had synchronized their minds, all the turtles brutally killed themselves in one bloodbath. Splinter had no power to stop them. The rat had hardly endured such anguish, but remained strong. The rat rose to his feet bearing arms and said, \"I have meditated long enough to fear nothing. You cannot kill me and I shall smite you with rightous vengeance. You can not win Pennywise.\" HAAAA HAAAAA HAAAAAAAAAA was the last thing to echo through the darkness with its sepulcher of stone, and wet pools of blood. Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip",

Always 30, jesus didnt anyone watch the first documentary about me, Eater of worlds and children? Outragious the mixups these fools get themselves into. The smell down here is different now, something less sinister and more invasive... Food? What fool without enticement from myself would bring food into my lair? One without fear i would assume. I'll soon change that. Through the sewers i creep, silently and unseen making only the most uncomfortable minor sounds as i feel they might arouse an uneasiness in my prey. The odor strengthens somehow piercing through the dank haze of old bones and raw sewage. I hear them now, not just one, perhaps three? No matter, I'll soon seperate them and bring forth their darkest fears. Green eyes, they haven't noticed me yet i can smell ones fear of rejection, aside from that a fear or not being able to protect loved ones, a hint of fear about not being accepted for their body, one smells only of anger and courage... These arent children... A lingering remembrance of a cage, a small cage, a rat! An enoumous rat! And turtles? Mutated large muscular turtles with arms at their sides. Disgusting, no fear i could drain from these... Monstrosities could ever quench the hunger of one such as me. Its only been 27 years anyway now that i think of it... Back to sleep for now, when i awaken perhapse I'll have a light snack of turtle fear with a side of rat before the feast of child flesh and fear...",

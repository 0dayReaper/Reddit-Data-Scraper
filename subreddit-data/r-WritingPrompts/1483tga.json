            "comment": "As I waited outside the cave entrance for my professor, I recalled a long ago incident at a caving complex half a planet away. I shuddered. Being stuck like that with death being the only way out, it scared me. I hate caves. I refuse to enter any cave, even the Mammoth Cave system. \n\nOddly, I\u2019m right at home in the underwater cave system found beneath the bay of my childhood home. Recently, I had guided a rescue team to a trapped diver. I grew up exploring those caves and had forgone breathing equipment. I didn\u2019t need it because I knew where all the air pockets were. I did have to slow myself down a bit so the rescue team could keep up. \n\n\u201cJacey!\u201d I started and spun to see my professor cracking up. \u201cThinking of your heroic swim?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, Dr. Jones! I\u2019m here now!\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cI really want you to see the drawings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do caves!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t even there and you still got traumatized?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thought of dying alone, stuck where no one can reach you or even rescue you, it\u2019s terrifying.\u201d \n\n\u201cActually, he was rescued.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cA paramedic from another station arrived to assist. Thanks to her small size, she was able to reach him. Using hand tools, she broke the rock apart which gave her space to reach and break up the piece of rock responsible for keeping him stuck. She then roped herself to him and scooted out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean the Silent EMT was successful? I thought she went in to make him comfortable and be with him as he died.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was the plan, until she reached him and decided to make one last attempt. He\u2019s fine, and still loves caving.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I was the guy stuck upside down. She explained what was going to happen and why she was there. I told her to put me down, but she asked to make one more attempt. I felt her move up my legs and she was able to break up the piece keeping me stuck. The next thing I felt was that I was moving. She was inching us backwards. I didn\u2019t dare to feel any hope of rescue until she\u2019d inched us back over a hundred feet, and I felt rescuers taking over to pull us out. Once I was out, I started ugly crying. I thought for sure I was dreaming. You don\u2019t know how amazing it feels to take deep breaths after hours of shallow gasps. Now, the drawings. I really want you to see them.\u201d\n\nI took a deep breath. \u201cI think I can manage as long as there\u2019s no\u2026 what do you people call it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean birth canal? Nope. Just one spot where you have to duck a little. I promise, they are not very far in. Just tell me if you need to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cLead the way.\u201d\n\nDr. Jones guided me into the cave. After a short walk with some ducking, we reached the spot with the drawings. I gasped, studying each one. \n\nThe first showed what could pass for a horse, if one removed what I deduced were a horn and wings. A white circle was behind the horse. Little human figures supplicated themselves to what I now thought of as their deity. They worshipped a horse like creature. \n\nThe second showed the deity fighting what looked like a smeared shape. I made out human like legs, but beyond that, nothing else. What was she fighting? Wait, she? Why did I feel as if the deity was female? \n\nThe next scene was of a feast. The deity presided over all. The smear with human like legs was on a spit being cooked over a fire. The deity must have killed some animal and gave it as food to her worshippers. \n\nThe final scene showed the deity leaving as the tiny human figures waved. There was a small white circle, which appeared to be where the deity was going. \n\n\u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d Jones asked excitedly.\n\n\u201cIt reads like a fairy tale. The deity came down, killed something, gave it as food to some people, and left. You said this had to do with the moon, but I\u2019m lost.\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cDo you see where she was flying to?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think a space horse is inside the moon?\u201d\n\nWe went back outside.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it. I know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? For all we know, that\u2019s just some ancient fairy tale.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen explain this.\u201d Jones showed me a picture. It showed the crack on the moon, and the large blue gem inside. \u201cThat\u2019s her eye. The quakes are her moving around.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned for your mental state, doctor.\u201d \n\n\u201cLook at this.\u201d Jones showed me a video. There was no audio, but I could clearly see the blue gem. Occasionally, flickered. The video speed slowed down. A giant golden lid floated down over the eye, and floated back up. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to harm us.\u201d\n\nI looked up at the moon, and studied its giant crack. I\u2019d heard the quakes were getting stronger. Still, a giant space alicorn? Seriously? That\u2019s what the expert next to me was claiming?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t because of the large chunk of asteroid that struck the Moon days ago? It was fourth the size of the moon. \n\nA second crack appeared on the moon. What looked like a gigantic yellow sail emerged, spreading out to its full size. A second sail spilled free from the original crack. They did look oddly like wings. \n\n\u201cI told you she\u2019s real and inside the moon!\u201d Jones crowed. \u201cEmerge from your cocoon, my Goddess, soar free!\u201d\n\nThe moon bulged. A large yellowish mountain sprouted through its crust. Moments later, it crumbled apart. I stared in dumb stupor as the newly awakened deity stretched her body out. The mountain on her head glowed like the sun, then I was staring at the moon again. I blinked. Jones was nearby, a look of rapture on his face. Had I seen what I just saw? \n\nDid a giant alicorn hatch from the moon and replace it? I blinked.\n\n\u201cThe moon was evacuated, right?\u201d",

            "comment": "Hi everyone, Today's my cake day and what better way to spend it than writing a short story!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were always crazy theories about the moon. a few centuries ago people would debate if the moon landing was faked, or if the moon was even real. unfortunately it is real. Today our greatest minds are debating if there's anything we can do to fix that. I'm Dan McAnchorman and this has been channel 6 news. Good night and God's speed America. \n\n\"This cant be real, Right?\" i say to my wife. We had been enjoying a night in with a dinner I cooked and some wine she bought from the market. \"I don't know Emma, It's everywhere... Facebook, 7Chan, even the MindNet seems to think it's real.\" everyone had been talking about \"Moon quakes\" the moon had been shaking for almost a decade and no one could figure out why. but last year there was a crack in the moon that prompted most of the Lunologists to start looking deeper into the moon. That's when they found what the internet has lovingly dubbed \"the space chicken\" but none of the x-ray images looked anything like a chicken. more like a living moving planet. Vaguely shaped like a human, with trees on it's head in place of hair, and mountains for toes. with every move of its massive legs another moon quake followed. What had me scared was what would happen to the earth when it hatched. I'm no expert but i Do know that the moon effects the earth, tides would change and destroy thousands of homes. and that's only what would happen if the thing decided to leave and not bother us. something that massive, even with all the combined strength of the Planet Defence system would likely be too much for them to handle. \n\n\"R\u00edta, what are we going to do\" I squeaked. \"if this thing is real is there anything we even can do?\" she whispered without turning from the TV, now showing some late night talk show that also stuck to the moon for its topic. \"Lets's just enjoy our night, and hope for the best. and if the worst comes at least we can spend that together too.\" She was right, I knew she was. really what would two small town girls with no real power to stop the moon itself do anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually we settled down for the night, deciding to curl up on the sofa and watch a good movie. as we were drifting to sleep I caught the start of an emergency broadcast as the haze of sleep slowly took me. \"Good evening everyone, I come bearing some difficult news. The creature within the moon has hatched, and with it a devastating amount of radiation will soon be striking the earth. this kind of radiation has not been previously observed outside of a super collider but has been dubbed 'Zeta Radiation'. We have no way of knowing how this will effect humanity so please stay indoors and if possible avoid line of site with the moon until the all clear is given.....\" \n\nThe last thing I remembered before drifting to sleep was looking out the window, and seeing to halves of the moon shining brightly with that creature looking down at earth. It felt as if it were looking directly at me.",

Just a big shiny egg up there.\u201d He chuckled, then coughed, a deep hacking sound that shook the thin metal chair beneath him. \n\n\n\u201cMan, you\u2019re all kinds of messed up right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Laughing and shaking my head, I stared up at the full moon above our heads. The bonfire crackling at our feet and the wind rustling through the trees were the only sound as we settled into a nervous, high silence staring up at the night sky. Of course, the next day we wouldn\u2019t remember this at all. But many years later, the moment came to me again- and I swear, the moon did look different that night. \n\n\n\u2014\n\nA crackle, then a pop as a newscast connected. \u201cReporting from Lunar Settlement 827, we have an update on the lifeform detected after the earthquakes that shook the outer districts. Our scientists say it is growing larger by the day. How concerned should you be? Tune in after the weather, and we will report on the latest in evacuation orders. Will you be on the next flight? Next, what to wear when -\u201c\n\n\nThe newscast image toppled sideways, the reporters face suddenly much closer, the cracks in her lipstick visible and her eyes, caked with mascara, wide.\n\n\nAn unpleasant scratching noise emitted, then the image righted itself. The reporter was upright and dusting herself off, a camera ready smile already in place. \n\n\n\u201cThis just in- we\u2019re receiving reports a large rift has torn apart some of the inner districts. We\u2019re still gathering information on which districts are affected, and how large- George, can we change over to the drone? Let\u2019s see if we can show you folks what\u2019s going on..\u201d\n\n\nThe newscast flipped to an aerial shot of the city- what once was the flourishing and colourful city center, was instead a large jagged tear, so sheer it faded to a stark blackness. \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go further up, to show you what\u2019s going on here\u2026\u201c The image obeyed, zooming up, up, and up, until -\n\n\nThe reporter trailed off into a shocked silence. As far up as the drone could go, the image showed the rift tore through not just the city, but as far as the horizon could see. In fact, at this distance, it almost looked like-\n\n\nA pop, as the newscast was turned off, leaving empty air. I leaned back in my seat, then smiled to myself.\n\n\n\u2014\n\nIf anyone had walked by at that time, they would have seen me, bent in two, a deep belly laugh echoing at my lips. Altogether too old and grey that it would have been a sight to see- but how often do the high ramblings of the late nights come true?",

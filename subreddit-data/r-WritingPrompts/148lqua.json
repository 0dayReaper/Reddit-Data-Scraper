            "comment": "He didn't know what he believed less - if it was the idea he was dead, the idea that a heaven existed, the idea that he *was in heaven*, the idea that angels existed, or the idea that his guardian angel was the person he had to save once...\n\n... but them he saw. It was hard to see, for angels have multidimensional forms that the human eyes can't actually comprehend; but now that he was dead, somehow his eyes were adapting to this thing, and he could see all the faces, bodies, moments... of every person he saved.\n\n\\- \"You... you were all of these people?\"\n\n\\- \"Yes!\" - a thousand voices said in unison, but at the same time, only one voice said that - \"It was me/us that you saved\"\n\n\\- \"But... you're an Angel! I guess?\" - it was hard to formulate. Things were already weird the thing they were, and it was becoming hard for him with all the distortion on the reality, the veils that mortal bodies create for his mind to understand the absolute chaos that reality actually is; it was further worsened by the fact that the angel looked as a normal person, and at the same time completely different; both were the same size and proportions, but at the same time the angel appeared to tower over the skies, growing up to insane proportions; and finally, because the angel was stationary, but at the same time seemed to be everywhere, like a superhero running really fast, and nowhere, like he didn't even exist.\n\n\\- \"Yes!\" - the angel answered. He became restless. None of his questions were being answered, and somehow he knew his mind was like a book to that being; even if it wasn't, his eyes didn't lie. But maybe the alien-ness of the situation was too much for such a being. He decided to dump all, at the same time, even if it didn't make sense - he was starting to feel a pressure on his head, and he was sure his eyes would start to bleed at any moment\n\n\\- \"So how? Why didn't you save yourself? Why didn't you save me? Why are you here, when I don't believe in you? Will I go to hell? Will I cease to exist? What happens now with you? Do I keep protecting you? You protecting me? What will happen?\"\n\n\\- \"You don't believed in me/us. You still don't. That doesn't make you a bad or good person; it never did. But you also were never exhibited fear; that would be your demise. You didn't believe in intuition; you never listened to strangers. There was only one way to protect you, and that was...\"\n\n\\- \"To remove me on the place it would cause me harm...\" - he remembered, a thousand pasts he never lived...\n\nWhen he saved that girl from the train, got late to his interview, never got the job. The company went bankrupt, and they put the blame on him, making him go to jail and loose everything...\n\nWhen he saved the old man from that robber, and got scolded by the police that he put himself in needless risk. He remembered not saving the old man, getting shot in the head by the conflict between the police and the drug dealers just minutes later...\n\nWhen he jumped on that tree, to save that cat, fell and broke his arm. A full month without being able to play his sport, and his team lost on the competition; because of this, he was scolded by the team, and decided to quit the club. He remembered not being scolded, winning the competition, getting more and more professional, becoming rich to the point he knew he was above law. His last days were he slowly dying on a hospital, after living a life without joy, where everything was ephemeral, where he knew nothing actually mattered and his only momentary joy was cheat death by driving sports cars after a lot of drug abuse, and the many lives he took on these rides...\n\n... much more memories, of things that never happened.\n\n\\- \"It seems that you remember...\" - the angel said. No blood tears happened, but normal ones. On his knees, he could only say \"thank you\", a couple of times, for living the \"boring\" life he lived, where he actually knew love, where he created beautiful children, where he helped so many people; for having all of these opportunities taken from him, things that would kill him or make him miserable, even when they were exactly what he wanted at the time.\n\n\\- \"I cursed you... multiple times. But I never regretted saving your life...\"\n\n\\- \"I/we know that. That's why you're here\"\n\n\\- \"And what happens now?\"\n\n\\- \"Whatever you want. But I think you already know the answer.\" - breathing heavily, his eyes focused somewhere, some*when*, and he was a memory - a memory of someone that he didn't know, that still didn't exist.\n\nAnd he knew what he had to do.",

            "comment": "\u201cWait, what?\u201d You ask again, eyes jumping from the shivering bundle of wings sitting beside you to the stern, solemn angel sitting behind the marble white desk\u2026 which seemed unnecessarily large for the man-woman- being? You decide on them when their form keeps shifting just as you decide to call them him or her in your head.\n\nThe angel sighs, its wings drooping, as it pinches the skin between their eyes.\n\n\u201cYou died. Dara,\u201d the pile of feathers next to you wails, \u201cwas supposed to be your guardian angel. Their job- their only job was to prevent that, and they failed. This isn\u2019t their first failure either, so they\u2019re to be sentenced to Abbadon\u2019s division to be\u2026re-educated,\u201d they smiled, making your own cheeks hurt as it stretched beyond the normal dimensions of their face.\n\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d you jump as the angel beside you leaps out of their chair to slam their hands on the desk, face reddened and tear-stained. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you think is fair doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d came the hissed voice of the stone-cold angel. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t fair is life, which is why humans are assigned guardian angels. You, failing at this job means you aren\u2019t obeying His orders!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m trying!\u201d\n\nYou jolt when the cold angel turns towards you, blank-faced. Despite the halo now on your head, you straighten your shoulders self-consciously not to be found wanting.\n\n\u201cWould you say your angel\u2019s attempts at rescuing you stopped you from dying?\u201d\n\n\u201cI-ugh, what attempts?\u201d A flicker of confusion crosses the stone face before it disappears, realization lighting their eyes from within. They turn back to Dara, who stiffens.\n\n\u201cDara, reveal your disguises to the human.\u201d Pressing their lips together, you watch as the angel turns to you with great reluctance, uncomfortable. Then, you watch as the angel\u2019s features ripple, turning into a face that tingles in the back of your mind as familiar. Seeing the incomprehension on your face, the angel changes their face again and again, and three more times before it hits you.\n\nAll the faces the angel has shown you\u2014they\u2019re people you saved before! A construction guy who\u2019d almost walked into traffic, not noticing the Do Not Walk Sign. A national coast guard falling into the water near the buoy you\u2019ve been clinging to in an attempt to rescue you, forcing you to save them instead. You\u2019d always wondered how a National Coast Guard regularly sent out to save people from open waters didn\u2019t know how to swim. You guess with those heavy wings they don\u2019t do much swimming. The ridiculousness of the thought makes you laugh.\n\nDara flinches, shifting back into their regular face, looking down.\n\nYou quickly shut up with a wince.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not even half of the things they\u2019ve screwed up!\u201d The angel cries, dropping a thick folder on the desk, making you cough as the impact dislodges what seems to be several decades worth of dust. Dara sinks into their chair, covering their face with a wing. \u201cDara is utterly incompetent. To allow them to continue in this way without some form of punishment would be inhumane.\u201d\n\n\u201cSending me to Abbadon would be cruel!\u201d Dara protested, \u201cIf I could just go back to my other job\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were reassigned! You can\u2019t just decide what you can and can\u2019t do on\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d you interrupt drawing the divine beings\u2019 attention, \u201cwhat was your other job?\u201d\n\nDara brightened, actually brightened, becoming a literal sun, beaming with happiness.\n\n\u201cHere we go,\u201d the angel muttered, but they paid them no attention.\n\n\u201cI was in charge of painting the skies\u2014sunsets, lunar eclipses, the Aurora Borealis, you name it! It\u2019s all my work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! That\u2019s amazing,\u201d you say actually amazed, watching the angel\u2019s wings fluff up in pleasure at the praise, but you can\u2019t help it. You can\u2019t believe your angel actually did all that, creating such beauty every day. It was truly amazing! You couldn\u2019t help but admire the angel, after all, the beauty of nature is what inspired you despite everything.\n\nAt that thought, you pause.\n\n\u201cHey, wait\u2026you did save me!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dara stuttered in surprise.\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d The angel demanded at the same time, eyes narrowed as it pulled the files back towards itself.\n\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t have had the life I had without you, well, your work really.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Dara asked, excitement dwindling as their confusion worsened.\n\nSeeing the puzzled looks, you hurry to speak. \u201cWell, when I was a kid, my life was pretty shit. My parents fought all the time, I was bullied at school, and I didn\u2019t have any friends so you know what I use to do, a kid raised in the middle of rural Alabama?\u201d You ask, staring intently at the angel.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d The angel whispers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I stared up at the sky and thought of all the things I would do when I got out of there. Every day, I\u2019d look up at that sky that was looking down on me, getting inspiration to carry on and not give up just because things weren\u2019t working out right now. The days helped me not fall prey to the statistics of being a kid from a broken home. I got out, went to college, majored in natural sciences where I met my wife\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cB-But, they weren\u2019t in that role during your life so it doesn\u2019t count!\u201d The angel cried. The hope in Dara's eyes disappeared at that undisputable fact, but if life has taught you anything, it\u2019s to always look for the silver lining, to look at every negative from every possible angle to find something to leverage a terrible situation into something good.\n\n\u201c\u2026But, if I\u2019m not mistaken, the skies haven\u2019t changed very much, have they? Their designs are still being used.\u201d\n\nDara blinked. The angel frowned, turning around and removing from a file cabinet another folder, which it flipped through quietly. The angel\u2019s frown deepened into a terrible scowl. It shot them a disgusted look.\n\n\u201cTrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoo\u2026\u201d You ask, leaning forward with a smile along with your angel, who looked pleadingly at its fellow. Looking at them both, they sighed and tossed the file back inside.\n\n\u201cSo technically, they did save you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Dara flew up in joy.\n\n\u201cBut!\u201d The angel spoke again. Their voice booming and loud without effort, sending Dara back to their seat. \u201cThat only counts as one save, and you are only one life. It doesn\u2019t discount the lives lost in their career.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Dara deflated. The glow around them dimmed at being reminded of their failure. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I- I did mess up a lot.\u201d\n\nYou frown, watching Dara sink into themself, resigning themselves to their fate. Narrowing your eyes, you turn back to the angel. \u201cWell, I seem to be pretty good at the job of being a guardian angel.\u201d\n\nThe angel snorted. \u201cYou can\u2019t take their place. You\u2019re a human.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk, but I can teach them how to be a proper guardian.\u201d You say, not really putting too much thought into what you were signing yourself up for.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The angel startled, fa\u00e7ade broken, eyes wide and wings puffing up in bewilderment.\n\n\u201cYeah, I can. I mean, I\u2019ve saved them tons of times.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be wasting years of your heavenly award trying to help them and that\u2019s assuming they ever learn!\u201d The angel said completely confused. Dara looked at you stunned, happy, and in disbelief. Their light slowly came back to them as they looked at you hopefully yet uncertain as if waiting for you to retract your statement, thinking you would realize what a mistake it was placing your bets on them.\n\nAnd it was that hopeful look that cemented your decision.\n\nBoth angels\u2019 eyes widened as the light above your head grew, bright enough to rival theirs. Keeping your eyes locked with your angel, you say with a grin, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got all of eternity so I\u2019ve got time to spare.\u201d",

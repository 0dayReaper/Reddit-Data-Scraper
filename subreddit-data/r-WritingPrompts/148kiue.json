            "comment": "I covered my surprise with a mask of disinterest. It's an easy thing to do, when you're used to heroes literally warping time and reality just to stop your plot for the week.\n\n\"Hey, Chips. Planning to sit there all day?\" I asked Digits' sidekick. Or... was Digits the sidekick, and Chips the hero? I couldn't tell which of the Tech Bros was actually meant to be the hero, but they were both clowns, and that was usually as far as my concern went.\n\n\"Huh? I mean, I mostly expected to spook you. What with my special adhesive suit and everything, I can now climb even the tallest buildings! Pretty neat for fighting crime, huh?\"\n\nI know it's anatomically impossible for me, but I still nearly rolled my eyes hard enough to eject them from my skull. I pulled a small lever next to the window, and the wall refrigerated itself to 15 Kelvin. The look on Chips' face was remarkable as his adhesive suddenly froze to his fingers and he fell off the side of the building. I sipped my cup of coffee, then turned around to get back to work.\n\nA few seconds later, a rather insistent knock came at my window. I walked over and saw Chips floating there on his patented rocket boots. It still amazed me that he didn't rip his legs off with those things. I made a note to ask Veronica, his personal engineer, how she did it. Maybe I should do it the next time I kidnap her?\n\nChips knocked again, a dour look on his face, and I decided it was worth walking over to the window and shutting the blinds. The cameras still caught his face, which transformed into a mask of wrath, and just before he smashed my window in, I called out, \"My front door is unlocked. It's easier to enter there than the window. A bit more discreet, too. Just food for thought.\" _Not that there are thoughts with any real worth in that head of yours_, I finished silently. \n\nTo his credit, I thought it would take him a full minute to get back here, and he managed it in 45 seconds. Still enough time for me to hide my plans from plain view, but not enough time to get Danse Macabre playing. I shrugged as he stormed in through my front door, red as a beet.\n\n\"I could have _died_ falling from that height!\" he shouted, spittle flying from his mouth.\n\n\"Sounds like a skill issue.\" I replied, wiping a fleck of his spit off my chin and frowning. \"Most people don't consider it a safety issue if I supercool something this out-of-the-way. It's actually within building codes, too.\" I looked casually down at my nails, giving him my most disinterested look. I could use a manicure, in all honesty. \"So, if you're not here to admire my architecture, perhaps you can tell me what you ARE seeking me out for?\"\n\n\"Well, we're trying to start up a new superhero team. And, since you're basically a hero now and all...\"\n\nI don't know what superpower Chips has, but I facepalmed. I *never* lose my cool, but this man actually got me to face-palm. As I dragged my fingers off my eyes, I replied, \"I saved an old, dying woman from a parasite. I did it _once_, as a _favour_, and now you expect I'd want to join a super-team? You *do* recall that I just robbed a research facility last week, acquiring a new flesh-eating super-virus?\"\n\nChips' face blanched a little. \"Um, no. Actually, I didn't hear that...\"\n\nI threw my hands in the air, and said, \"Yes! See, the vial is right he-- oh. Oh no. Um... hey, you wouldn't happen to be immune to flesh-eating viruses, would you? What with being all...\" I waved my hand up and down in his direction, \"tech-y and everything?\" I asked as I picked up an unsealed metal bottle with an ominous-looking symbol on the side.\n\nChips stumbled. As he fell, his jet boots activated and launched him out my door, through the room on the opposite side, and out into the afternoon air.\n\nI chuckled to myself and set my favourite Mr. Fixy Bot to cleaning up the rubble. Placing the empty container that I'd been using as a vase on my end table, I sipped my coffee and thought a little bit more about the idea of joining a super-team. Pranking heroes sure was easier when they let their guard down around you.\n\nWell, maybe after this next operation, I'll give it some real thought. For today, I had an engineer to kidnap.",

Please, it could have just been drink or some prankster with a drone, but no, that face remained and opening the window revealed the face to not exist lest I see it through the glass.\n\nIt doesn't blink. I don't get it. Why doesn't it blink? It's eyes are some disgusting shade of blue and I swear I recognize who it is, but every time I see it, I think see someone else.\n\nI leave the room and hope maybe it will go away, but it's in another window now. Still staring at me like a pervert and a judge and a random passerby. I don't get it, why the hell isn't it blinking?!\n\nI throw my shot glass at the window, it shatters, and the shards stare at me. Laying on the floor, every piece as though the glass was a residence of the apartment and I just an interloper. Eyes open eyes and the glittering particles of judgement on the cream carpet and clean walls taint the air with choking lack of privacy.\n\nI scream and I scream until my throat is hoarse from breathing in shards of those eyes and still they remain. Why aren't you blinking?!\n\nI start to beg, pleading with money and sacrifices each more severe than the last. Anything, everything, for your eyes to leave me alone. I shatter every window and sweep the glass away only to find my blood is but glass itself and the eyes are still there looking out from inside me like a panoptic parasite of my being.\n\nI leap out from this hell, the last recourse to get away from the unrelenting judgement. The wind scrapes my eyes from me as it whistles a sickly song of impending doom. I cry for relief until the concrete silences me.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLights flicker red and blue, shadows dancing over a bloodied corpse as standard issue boots stand around the scene.\n\n\"Poor guy. Must have had a bad bet or somethin.\" Says one pair of boots.\n\n\"Ill never understand the rich ones.\" Says the other. \"Like, they got everything, and then jump out of a building.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's weird.\"\n\n\"Hey, you see that in the blood?\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I dunno, it kinda looks like an eye or somethin...\"\n\n*end*",

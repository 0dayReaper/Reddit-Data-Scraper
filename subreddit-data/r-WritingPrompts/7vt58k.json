            "comment": "Edited July 28, 2020\n\nDear YouTube: StoryShuttle stole this story from me. They DO NOT have my permission to use my story as content for their video. Thank you\n\nConsciousness flooded James Bond all at once, but he did not show it. He stayed slack in his chair, eyelids limp, only listening. He sat strapped into the driver's seat, hands taped firmly to the steering wheel. They had put him in a thick white space suit that made his forehead prickle in fear-sweat. \n\nHe turned his head toward the mirror. His visor was so dark he could not see his own eyes staring back at him.\n\nBeyond the car he heard nothing but the faint murmur of voices speaking on the other side of the glass. \n\nThe back of his head ached in a slow, pulsing way, but he wasn't bleeding. Couldn't have been that bad. He could still think. He could still get out of this.\n\nHe always could.\n\nAdrenaline erased the ache in his head, his horror and muted, near-forgotten panic. He knew where he was. Where he had to be.\n\nSomeone knocked at the window to his right. The passenger door rose.\n\nThe agent raised his eyes to see the face of the man he had pursued for weeks: the billionaire inventor who planned to blow up the Earth, once he shepherded all the most cultured and valuable people off of it. \n\n\"Musk,\" Bond spat. He sat up, maintaining a defiant air of dignity, despite his raging headache. \n\nElon Musk grinned back at him. He swung open the door. Behind him stood a wall of armed henchmen, their fingers poised over triggers. He waved a dismissive hand to him and relaxed.\n\nMusk relaxed into the car beside him and patted the seat like it was his own child. \"This was one of the earliest ones, you know. The first cars we produced.\"\n\nBond stared out the slanted window, steely-eyed and silent. He wriggled the fingers of his left hand out of his bulky glove one by one.\n\n\"It's a good send-off. Symbolic. People love a good symbol.\" He looked Bond over and patted his knee. \"You're integral, you see. I couldn't have done this without you.\"\n\n\"Why are you doing this?\" Bond sighed. His breath pearled in little beads of condensation down his visor.\n\n\"It's simple, Mr. Bond. I very much prefer you dead. And I would prefer to ensure no one can come looking for clues.\" \n\nHis left hand came free of the glove. The suit was thick enough that it more or less held its shape as he snaked his arm slowly, tenuously, out of the sleeve of his suit.\n\n\"What is it you plan to do, then?\" Bond bit his lip, hard. This was his safest strategy. The best way to steal every spare second he needed.\n\n\"I think it's rather self-explanatory, Mr. Bond. Your suit\"--he rapped Bond's helmet with his fist--\"has a built-in radio. I've strapped you here to drive my car on its final journey.\" He spread his hands upward, and the ceiling panels opened overhead to a sky of smoke and stars. \"You'll be my Starman. I'll launch you into space. This suit, lovely as it looks, is not as airtight as it could be. It was designed for a dummy, you see. You'll have to do, for now.\"\n\nBond growled through his teeth, \"Damn it, Musk--\"\n\nBut Elon Musk carried on as if he did not hear, \"Don't try to hold your breath, Mr. Bond; your lungs will only explode. And the last thing you'll hear before shattering through our stratosphere and dying alone in the cold perfect vacuum of space... will be Earth. Cheering as you go.\"\n\nHe had his arm bent as far it could go without bulging in the suit. Did not so much as look toward Elon Musk.\n\n\"That's the plan, then?\" he asked, solemnly.\n\n\"It appears so.\" Elon Musk smiled up at the stars. \"You'll be flying straight to hell at eleven kilometers a second, buddy.\" He slapped Bond's chest and laughed like they were old friends. \"And we were just getting to know each other.\"\n\nBond yanked his arm out of his suit, delved into his jacket pocket for his pen. An innocent little thing, the metal battered and bruised, the ink dry. No one would think to remove it when they patted him down.\n\nMusk laughed. \"It's admirable, but don't think you can escape, Mister--\"\n\nHe never got the chance to finish.\n\nJames Bond depressed the tip of his pen. A burst of red light ate through the hide of his suit and sheared the windshield overhead in two.\n\nMusk staggered backward and shrieked, \"*Shoot* him! Shoot him, you stupid bastards!\"\n\nThe men surged forward.\n\nBond leapt out of the spacesuit and bolted like a rabbit out of his seat. He still wore his suit, albeit wrinkled, and his pocket square gone. They had taken his gun, so Bond dove behind the car and raised his pen. Calculated to himself how much mortal damage it could really carry out.\n\nHe smirked. \n\nNow seemed as good a time as any to find out.\n\n***\n\n/r/shoringupfragments \n\nJames Bond *usually* murders everyone in the room with a laser at the end of a movie right?",

His lungs compressed, then almost collapsed, as his entire being shook.\n\nAll the while, he thought he could hear Musk's evil laugh. \n\nHe would not go out like this. \n\n****\n\nThe rockets plunged into space. At his current trajectory, he would forever be stuck in orbit, his corpse withering away in isolation - the perfect crime. Musk would have won, and no one on earth would know that their savior was in fact their doom. Musk had revealed his plans for humanity in true villain fashion - even he could not resist a monologue. \n\nBond knew how helpless his situation was. There were no parachutes, no way to cancel the payload detachment. Though Bond had survived countless missions before, he knew that this was his end. \n\nBut he planned to go out in style. \n\nHe eventually managed to pry his right arm loose from the straps. With that, he switched on the car, accessing the GPS system.\n\nHe knew there was no way of landing safely back on earth... he could only crash. But he could crash with *purpose*.\n\nMusk had let his hubris get the better of him, Bond thought, as he hacked into the GPS system with a small, metallic object - a deceptively simple device, but then again, Musk was a man of simple efficiency. He used the same GPS system on the car as the rockets itself, and it was a simple task of linking the two operating systems together.\n\nHe typed in his destination, pressed 'confirm', and felt the rockets shudder. They used the last of their fuel to divert their course back to earth, then detached themselves soundlessly.\n\nBond kept on telling himself it was for the good of the world. That this was a selfless act. \n\nBut deep down, he tasted revenge. \n\nAs he entered the atmosphere, the car burning up, he stared at the blinking GPS system. His destination was nearing, ever so quickly. \n\nAs he felt his suit set alight, as a magnificent house came into view, he could only hope that Musk was home. \n\n****\n\n[CroatianSpy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/)",

Still, he kept cool, smirking slightly.\n\n\"Do you really expect me to understand why you're doing this, Musk?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die.\" Shouldering his flamethrower, the eccentric billionaire exited the cockpit. The door shut with a pneumatic hiss, and the secret agent leaped into action, muscles straining as he popped free of his bonds. He wasted a second ensuring the discreet recorder in his Oxfords was secure before turning his attention to the door. It had never meant to keep someone locked inside. Weight restraints meant that SpaceX hadn't done much to reinforce it. Still, Bond couldn't get through.\n\nThe radio turned on, a burst of static before Elon's voice came through. The gloat was gone, replaced with a twinge of sadness.\n\n\"Mr. Bond? If you make it if you do meet up with the mothership, tell my girls I'll be home soon.\"",

            "comment": "Elon Musk spoke calmly and carefully, \u201cJames, James, James. Don\u2019t you understand? You cannot slow progress.\u201d Elon was now staring down at a restrained James Bond. \u201cI am the change, I am the progress, and the world celebrates me for it.\u201d \n\nMr. Bond listened stoically to his adversary\u2019s speech. He had been in similar situations many times before. Bound to a table, impending injection, this was nothing new for James. He remained unconcerned and listened intently to Elon. \n\n\u201cYour governments lack the vision of what our species *can* be. You are a part of the dying guard. So what if we have to sacrifice small part of the population. Logically, this is a small price to play for the survival and propagation of humanity.\u201d Confused by James\u2019 seeming lack of interest, Elon snapped further, \u201cAre you listening Mr. Bond? You and your governments are ensuring the destruction of our plant. I am merely giving us hope. And you know what? The world loves *me* for it.\u201d \n\nJust as Elon ended his rant, James simply began to laugh. Through his tears of laughter, James began to respond, \u201cYou\u2019re all the same aren\u2019t you? It\u2019s you! The righteous savior,\u201d he laughed again and continued, \u201cWhat a load of bollocks.\u201d \n\nElon stopped, looked at James, and flashed a small closed mouth smile. \n\nJust as James was accustomed to being in difficult situations, Elon had become comfortable with people not understanding his grandiose visions. He jumped down awkwardly from the cat walk and now circled James. As he circled his prey, he began inspecting the restraints and the injection equipment to his left. He then looked up at one of his employees and asked, \u201cI assume the injection is ready?\u201d The man nodded back to Elon. \n\n\u201cOk, James, here is what\u2019s going to happen. We are going to inject you with a serum. This is a special serum full of nanoparticles to systemically kill you from the inside out.\u201d Elon looked down at James to see if he was impressed. He could see a bead of sweat forming on Mr. Bond\u2019s brow. Elon began to chuckle and then said, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding! That is far too much work and to be completely honest, a complete waste of time. We\u2019re just going to inject you with potassium chloride.\u201d Elon grinned widely and then laughed abruptly. \n\nElton John\u2019s song \u201cRocket Man\u201d started to play loudly in the large room. About seven meters from the table was the Tesla Roadster that James would soon be riding into the great expanse. Before James could struggle, a space suit began to envelope his body from the table. Elon looked on impressed with this touch. \u201cWe don\u2019t even need to unstrap you to prepare this!\u201d Elon started to bounce with the beat as he watched his nemesis begin to formulate slight signs of panic. \n\nElon\u2019s employee went over to the injection apparatuses and began to set all of the parameters on the computer. When he was finished he looked up and asked Elon, \u201cShould I press the button?\u201d \n\nElon shouted, \u201cNO!\u201d \n\nHe wiggled more intensely with the beat and said, \u201cI want to do that, it\u2019s my favorite part!\u201d \n\nMr. Bond tracked him with his eyes as Elon shimmied closer to the computer. James remained stoic, ready to accept his impending fate. \n\u201cAu revoir monsieur Bond!\u201d Before he could press the button, he stopped and leaned into James, \u201cWait... Can you hear that James? Listen closely. Can you hear it now?\u201d James gritted his jaw and looked up at Elon. \u201cDo you hear the applause? Do you hear the world applauding the beautiful progress that you are facilitating?\u201d \n\nElon tiled his head slightly to the left, smiled wider, and pressed the button on the computer. A needle plunged deep into Mr. Bond\u2019s chest with incredible force. The fluid from the syringe began to empty slowly, and as it emptied, James began to convulse. \nElon stepped away from the table and began to do his best John Travolta impression from the \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d diner scene. He danced his way over to the Tesla Roadster. \n\nElon shouted back to the table where James\u2019 seemingly lifeless body laid, \u201cCome on guys, lets get this done! I have things to do.\u201d \nA handful of men unstrapped James from the table and began to carry him over to the Roadster. They all struggled trying to move him. One of the men walked over with Mr. Bond\u2019s helmet in hand. After they completed strapping him into the car, Elon grabbed the helmet from his employee. He placed it over James\u2019s head carefully. He then twisted the helmet gently until he heard a securing click. Looking on fondly to his work, he slowly kissed the visor of the helmet. After a moment, he moved back and turned on the car\u2019s radio to blast \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d, by David Bowie. \n\n\u201cMay this be our vessel of progress, may you be our ambassador to the stars, Mr. Bond.\u201d \n\nAs Elon walked towards the exit, he relished the sheer simplicity of this part of his plan. Just as he exited, James\u2019 eyes flashed open and he was covered in a hot sweat. Ironically enough, the nanoparticles that MI6 had injected did their job. He was just thankful everyone in the room bought his performance of a lifetime. He looked around, and began to assess his escape route. As he did, he could help, but think to himself, *\u201cAu revoir Mr. Bond? Is he serious? He\u2019s seen way too many spy movies.\u201d*\n\n",

            "comment": "James struggled to move. His suit had been drilled into the sides of the car, restricting his motion. On top of that, the man had given him a sedative that would relax his muscles while keeping his mind fully aware of the situation he was in. \n\nMillions of people would be watching, yet none of them would know the true horror of the spectacle they were watching. An actual man in that suit? A ridiculous idea. \n\n\"You can't stop this, Mr. Bond. Once this rocket launches, the final step of my plan will be in full motion.\"\n\nJames mentally shook his head as he remembered the subtle stutter Elon had developed to lure his followers into believing he was an innocent man with the best intentions driving his endeavors. No one would suspect the truth. *It was all an elaborate scheme.*\n\n*****\n\nJames heard the countdown and closed his eyes. As the rocket took off, the weight of a million tons crushed him into his seat, and through the deafening roar of the 27 Merlin engines firing, he could hear the seemingly louder, deafening applause that came through the headset Musk had placed in his suit. Bond passed out. \n\n******\n\nWhen he awoke, he thought he was in a dream. He could not move his head, but his eyes darted around in his helmet. He was floating in a vacuum, but as he looked ahead, he teared up at the sight of his planet. It looked so peaceful from up here, far away from the petty squabbles that corrupted its surface. \n\nBut Bond did not feel sorry for himself. He felt sorry for the millions of people who would worship Elon for the next few years. He felt sorry for the millions of people who would count down the days until Musk launched the Mars Transporter.\n\nAnd most of all, he felt sorry for the millions of people who would scream in joy when Musk himself boarded his rocket to Mars, completely unaware of the nuclear weapons he would unleash on Earth once he was gone... \n",

            "comment": "Elon Musk clapped his hands before pointing to his rival, James Bond. Elon took in a deep breath before announcing, \u201cIt is time!\u201d Elon tapped his watch while moving over towards the control panel surrounded by his employees. \n\n\u201cIs this thing working?\u201d Elon tapped the microphone. The microphone was linked into the spacesuit in which James Bond was trapped inside of. The white spacesuit was locked into position inside of a Tesla Roadster built onto Elon\u2019s rocket.\n\n\u201cOkay, I hope this thing is working now because I must tell you about my plan that is literally out of this world!\u201d Elon covered the microphone before laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m going to do Mr. Bond. I\u2019m going to have you in that spacesuit with a radio, strapped to my Tesla. Then,\u201d Elon tried to fight his giggle, \u201cwhile mankind watches, I\u2019ll launch you into space!\u201d Elon smiled waiting for James to respond. Elon realized that James wasn\u2019t able to talk back from his suit. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mr. Bond. I know that you are speechless! Let me just say that the last thing you\u2019ll hear before leaving this earth forever, will be everyone\u2019s applause.\u201d Elon glanced over towards his employees letting out a good chuckle.\n\nTalulah Riley, a beautifully blonde European woman with green eyes locked onto Elon\u2019s madness. \u201cStop!\u201d She insisted, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this!\u201d\n\nElon snapped his fingers before one of his men grabbed Talulah. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with you later.\u201d Elon waved the man to escort her out of the hanger. He leaned himself over the controls before pressing the rocket to start initial launch protocol.\n\n\u201cFinally.\u201d Elon remarked. \u201cI will have finally solved the James Bond problem once and for all.\u201d\n\nElon pressed the ignition on the control panel. His employees tried to insist that he shouldn\u2019t handle the controls but this was Elon\u2019s show now. He knew it was he who had to launch James Bond into space personally. \n\nThe thrusters sparked into a bright blue flame before taking off from the ground. Elon cheered as he watched the Tesla holding James within the suit lift up towards the heavens. The rocket darted towards the atmosphere playing Bowie from Elon's controls.\n\nElon took a few seconds of victory before looking over his shoulder at one of his employees holding their hands up in fear. Elon slowly turned around to find James Bond holding a pistol in front of him. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over Elon.\u201d James frowned.\n\n\u201cOver? I just launched the rocket that you were supposed to be on! How did you escape?!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? I was never on the rocket.\u201d James raised his pistol to eye level.\n\nElon scrunched his brow before scratching his head. \u201cYou were in the spacesuit. How are you no longer in the spacesuit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was never in a spacesuit.\u201d\n\nTalulah barged back into the hanger with a gun given to her by James. Elon quickly glanced over at Talulah holding the gun up towards him. While making her way up the stairs onto the control deck, she glared at Elon.\n\nElon, unarmed, smiled towards James. James rolled his eyes before noticing that Talulah was now aimed down onto him instead of Elon. \u201cYou were supposed to be on that rocket.\u201d She remarked.\n\n\u201cI must say if I had been, you played the part of damsel in distress quite well.\u201d James replied.\n\nElon motioned her to his side. \u201cAlways loyal to the mission at hand, unlike your cancer in Europe.\u201d\n\nJames didn\u2019t lower his weapon. He and Talulah kept aim on each other before Elon pointed his forefinger in the air asking, \u201cWho was it then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was what then?\u201d James asked.\n\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t in that suit, then who did I just launch into space?\u201d Elon laughed while Talulah kept a stern face.\n\nJames\u2019 expression fell when he realized that Agent Q was nowhere in sight. In this moment the sound of the rocket piercing the atmosphere thundered in the distance.\n\n***\n\nTo read more of my stories, visit [r/13thOlympian] (https://www.reddit.com/r/13thOlympian/)",

            "comment": "I hope this is ok. It's the first one I've done and was written on mobile so might have a few errors. Feedback is welcome.\n\nIt had been 200 years since Elon Musk had made history by launching his car into space. Since then, society had become much more advance. \n\nThe current \"M\" of MI6 always stopped to look at the wall of lost agents. The legendary James Bond always stuck out, possibly because they had never satisfactorily answered what had happened. As M got to his office, the current 007 stopped flirting with M's assistant and greeted her with a respectful \"Ma'am\".\n\n\"007, back from Mars I see. Find anything worthwhile on Space X?\"\n\n\"No ma'am. They're either as charitable as they seem or extremely good at hiding it. I did find something else of interest though\"\n\n007 helped himself to some scotch. Even if it was artificial, it was still good.\n\nM sighed in disapproval as she sat down. \"007, it is 9am. No time for Scotch. And do not tell me you're adjusting to Earth time, I know for a fact it is 7am equivalent at the colony on Mars!\"\n\n007 downed the glass, and decided not to pour another after some brief eye contact with M. Choose your battles he thought to himself.\n\n\"Take a seat and explain this something else of interest. Quickly if you please.\"\n\n007 took a seat and a deep breath. \"During my mission I.... Liased with Elon Musk's great, great granddaughter. Several times actually. Even once in a rover! But I digress. She mentioned to me that a deep family secret is that Musk was actually a madman and that if his family hadn't stopped him, he would have taken over the world. It was only after the launch of the first falcon heavy that he became more benevolent, almost like a completely different person. She stated that in his later years, that he said he was at peace now, that his greatest enemy was far, far away listening to David Bowie. I believe James Bond was in the car Musk launched past Mars two centuries ago.\" \n\nM sat in stunned silence. She knew Bond had been at the Space X facility on Earth on the night his name was removed from the list of code names out of respect to an MIA agent. But they had never know what he was investigating, only that he had had a hunch. Could this be true? \n\n\"Where would the car be now?\" \n\n\"Well out into deep space now. It left our solar system around 150 years ago.\" Replied 007. He was calm on the outside, but internally he was excited. He had wanted that code name ever since he had got 00 status. He hadn't felt this good even when he'd stolen the last Aston Martin DB5 on Earth from the transport museum. All M had to do was suggest...\n\n\"We should attempt to retrieve the body. Have Q set this up, with the cover story being that it's for historical scientific research.\"\n\n007 nodded, and almost screamed with victory. He left at once to make arrangements, not even acknowledging M's disappointed and slightly flustered secretary.\n\nA few months later, 007 awoke from a standard 8 hour period of sleep on the craft taking him to rendevouz with the space Tesla. While not widely used, faster-than-light travel was possibly, unsurprisingly made so by Space X. He took a crafty swig from his hip flask, worrying that it felt less than half full. Navy dullards didn't allow alcohol on board. They were due to meet the car today, and it was all 007 could do to keep his cool exterior in place. \n\n\"We've got it Commander!\" Yelled an Ensign to 007. Trust them to use his naval rank. 007 ran forward, letting his facade slip slightly. Through the forward viewport, a small dot could be seen getting closer each second. He grinned in anticipation. Preparations to take the car onboard were made. \n\nTwo agnosing hours later in which the hip flask became more empty, the car was on board. 007 approached it slowly marvelling at the fact that this thing was 200 years old. The paint was destroyed, the metal itself warped and covered in pockmarks. The space suit was in tatters, but amazingly the visor was still in tact. The body was very well preserved by the vacuum of space. 007 reverently removed the helmet, paused for a second, and laughed out loud for sometime. When he had got himself under control, he reached out for a comm unit and contacted M, still chuckling to himself as he looked at the frozen face of Elon Musk.",

            "comment": "Bond stared out at the curvature of the horizon.  He would have to thank Musk for making the space suit functional, his final moments would pass in blissful contentment.  Bond\u2019s death would be of little consequence, he reasoned.  The data proving Musk\u2019s nefarious intentions was already on a drone reprogramed to fly to the SIS Building.  He was sure Q would be able to make sense of it all and blow the conspiracy wide open.  So Bond just sat, enjoying the overview effect so often discussed by astronauts.\n\nA blinking red light caught his attention.  Not on the car or the blue orb before him, but out in the black, slowly drifting towards him.  He watched as the red light became a beacon, the small jumble of electronics and solar panelling became gargantuan.  He stared at it absently, until he noticed the short bursts of liquid fuel coming from the satellite.  This was not a chance encounter, the craft was coming towards him on purpose.\n\nBond fumbled with the seatbelt.  He had been unconscious for the trip into orbit, Mr. Musk had not seen it necessary to make the restraints difficult to remove.  He unclipped the last restraint then had to lunge for the strap again as he immediately began to float out of the car.  Grasping his lifeline, he shifted his focus back towards the satellite.  It had synchronized its orbit with the car and now seemed to hover just above him.  James wondered if Musk\u2019s lust for revenge was so great that he might want a front row seat for his eventual asphyxiation, but now that the probe was stationary, Bond noticed the red light was not merely blinking; it was following a pattern.\n\n.... . .-. . / - --- / .... . .-.. .--. --..-- / .--- .- -- . ... / -....- --.-\n\n\u201cYou cheeky devil!\u201d Bond exclaimed, letting go of his hold for a second.  He immediately regretted the outburst, barely just getting a hold of the windshield before he floated into the ether.  He looked back towards the light, the pattern had changed.\n\n.- ..- -.. .. --- / --- -. / -... .- -.-. -.- .-.-.- / -.-- . .-.. .-.. --- .-- / .--. .- -. . .-..\n\nBond steeled himself.  He looked at the twenty meters between the car and the satellite, it might as well have been miles.  He looked at the car.  Cherry red, black interior.  It was beautiful, he supposed; but it was no Aston Martin.  He pushed off.  He may have overdone it a bit.  He immediately saw that he was moving quite quickly towards the MI6 spy satellite.  He quickly gauged his point of contact and looked for hand holds.  A few antennas and latches seemed promising, he\u2019d have to put his faith in an evil genius\u2019s suit design and his own strength.  His knee hit first, slamming hard into a solar panel, cracking it.  His hand found a rung of an engineering ladder, he slipped his arm into it to the wrist, not trusting his grip.  He bounced back hard, his right arm the only point of contact to the satellite, but he held.  Slowly drifting back towards his new ship, he took one last look at his roadster.  A testament to human engineering floating  lazily in front of the vastness of the Earth.  He pitied the loss of such a great mind, wondering why such potential sometimes came with such a lust for control and destruction.  He shook of his reverie and began climbing, hand over hand, towards the back of the back of his ride.\n\nThe panel was easy to find, marked with yellow and black stripes, it read, \u201cINTERNAL DIAGNOSTIC FEED\u201d, in bold letters.  Again, Bond thanked the man who ultimately put him in this mess for his excellent design as his gloved fingers easily maneuvered the panel open.  Inside, a cord slowly billowed out of the panel.  On one end, it plugged into the satellite.  The other was a standard 3.5mm jack ready to go into any audio equipment from the past forty years.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t beat simplicity, I guess.\u201d Bond mused.  He had a brief moment of panic wondering where he\u2019d be able to plug the cord in.  In his flailing, he noticed the systems panel on his right wrist, complete with audio jack port.  These space guys really knew their stuff, he thought.\n\nJames plugged the cord in.\n\n\u201cBond.  MI6 to James Bond, copy.  Speak as normal.  MI6 to James Bond. Speak as Normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cMI6 this is Bond.\u201d  There was a pause, then cheers.  The voice was Q\u2019s, but he must have been in some sort of mission control room.\n\n\u201cHello Mr. Bond! How are you doing up there?\u201d The cheers were being muffled, Q\u2019s voice was shaky.\n\n\u201cA little lightheaded, but alright other than that.  Had a bit of car trouble, might need a jump.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent to hear.  We\u2019ve got what you need, we hope. Three feet to the left of the panel is a safety strap, we need you to click in and confirm.\u201d  James looked to the left and saw nothing, he looked all around until he found a panel about three feet up.  The harness was equally easy to deploy, he found a loop on his suit and attached himself to the satellite.\n\n\u201cI am secured.  Quick note, perspective is a little strange up here, left and right might not due.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstood.  Hold on tight, you\u2019ve got a date with a resupply shuttle.\u201d  As Bond tried to wrap his head around what Q said, the strap went tight.  James would have expected some warning, some noise, to let him know that they had fired thrusters; but of course, this was space, the liquid fuel merely made a slight cloud and moved the satellite onto a new trajectory.  He was headed towards some supply shuttle they had on an intercept course.\n\n\u201cQ\u2026how?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe received your little package.  US forces are already moving to intercept Musk.  We weren\u2019t sure where you were, but we knew that you wouldn\u2019t send a drone with that sort of material unless you couldn\u2019t get out yourself.  I went to school with Elon, he always was a showman.  I figured he wouldn\u2019t miss an opportunity to make a grand show of getting rid of the biggest thorn in his side.  I knew you\u2019d be on that rocket and when I saw the car\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the satellite?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was easy, all these EUSA types seem to think driving a satellite is business, but I play video games with my son every night, he could\u2019ve gotten to you in half the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell get him on payroll then, I\u2019m getting queasy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight away, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cQ, what about Margarita?\u201d\n\n\u201cMs. Meyer has been taken into custody, James.  But she\u2019s safe.  You really know how to pick them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you Q.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get you back floating in tin can shortly, Mr Bond.\u201d\n\nJames turned back towards the Earth, intent on enjoying the ride.",

It shouldn't be too hard for you, being who you are,\" M said to Bond. \"With us by your side, we can show the world what Musk is really up to.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Alright, I'll take the mission.\" Bond said to her. \"I've faced much worse in my day, he can't be worse than what I've already faced.\" He went to Q to get his new toys.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once at Q's lab, Bond asked him to show him what he'll be using.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Well, you can't get through his house without this radiation dampener. It makes it so nothing can see you through any spectrum of light or radiation. The only downside is that once you put it on, we can't contact you, or see where you are. Be careful with this. Another one is this laser pen, a classic. It's laser is invisible to the naked eye, making it harder to detect. But of course, if those fail, you'll have a miniature EMP, designed to affect an area of 2 square miles, enough to take out his whole house at once. And once you do that, you'll have guns built into your suit to defend yourself and take out Elon, only if necessary. Keep him alive.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bond asked, \"When will I be leaving?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q responded,\"In about 45 minutes, enough to get through London traffic at this hour.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bond got to Heathrow, and got on a non-stop private flight to San Francisco.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the way, he went over the plan again. He would sneak through the back window on the 2nd floor to get in, turn on the radiation dampener, then proceed to Musk's back room, containing plans for world obliteration. He would get through with the laser pen, and grab the plans. After that, he would get out. Simple as that.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once he got to Elon's house, he got in without any issues. But that's where the plan fell apart. He put on the dampener, but it failed to turn on. He tried again, but to no avail. Out of the inky black, came a familiar voice; it's owner quite well known. \"I'm surprised you would come at this time of night, Mr. Bond. I was about to go to bed, too. Well, no matter. This will only take a couple minutes,\" Musk said to Bond, with a wry grin on his face. Bond pulled out his laser pen, but that didn't work either. \"You see, Mr. Bond, I expected you'd bring your toys, so I brought mine. I put a small electric field where I knew you'd come in, that would permanently fry all of your gadgets. I also brought my flamethrower, in case you tried fighting back. But I don't think that's going to happen.\u201d Bond felt a blow on the back of his head, and fell unconscious.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He woke up, not knowing where he was, but he felt as if gravity was tilted just a little. He opened his eyes, only to see the inside of a red car, a Tesla Roadster, that was inside a circular building. \"Of course\" thought Bond. But it got worse. He looked down, and saw that he was in a spacesuit. He immediately realized what was actually happening. But before he could think on how to escape, Elon stepped beside him. \"Well, good afternoon, Mr. Bond. I hope you had a good flight here. We had to get you all the way to Cape Canaveral, after all.\" Bond looked for anything on him, but couldn't come up with something. Elon noticed this, and said \"You can't get out of there, Bond. I made sure we got rid of everything that you had, to make sure you wouldn't escape, including those guns on your cufflinks. I also added some reinforcement to the suit, so you couldn't break it apart. The last thing you'll ever hear is David Bowie's Starman, mixed with the cheers of millions, cheering for your demise. Have a safe flight!\" Elon walked out of the room, at which point Bond realized what was about to happen. But by then, it was already too late. The rocket was going up in just 4 minutes. He tried, but he knew this was the end of the line. \"He thought of everything,\" Bond whispered to himself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rocket blasted off. Bond was thrust into the back of his seat. He knew he had to act now. He got out of the car, and strapped himself to the walls. He knew they would fall apart from the first stage in a few minutes. Sure enough, he was right. And there was one thing that Musk forgot about: his radio. He sent a message to MI6 asking them to pick him up. He then fell into the darkness of unconsciousness.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When he woke up, everything was a blur. He didn't know who had him, but he swore that in all of the chaos of him being picked up from the ocean, he could see Musk's face.",

There was something familiar about the pointed cheekbones and wide, grinning mouth, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.\n\n\"Bit of an unsightly chap, isn't he?\"\n\n\"The Sulk Omen, Mr. Bond, is what some might call a God amongst men. He shows up throughout history, if you look hard enough, wherever there is human suffering, woe, and calamity.\"\n\n\"Mr. Musk, if you're going to kill me, I'd appreciate if you'd get on with it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm getting to that. In Ancient Egypt, they told tales of a spectral creature called Skelumon, who once crouched at the banks of the Nile and drank it dry, causing a seven year famine. After the Crusades, the surviving Moors spoke of a savage character named Monk Ules, infamous for drenching his victims in caustic holy water. And you will have heard of Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. But it's a well-guarded secret that all of his ideas came from the contributions of a mysterious lab assistant, Ms. Lo Nuke.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Mr. Musk, but how do the antics of a mythical, time-traveling lunatic affect our current situation?\"\n\n\"Think, Mr. Bond. If there's one characteristic that defines humans, it's shortsightedness. The Sulk Omen has gained a reputation for suffering, but this is only because you are incapable of seeing the complete chain of events. Human beings are wonderful progenitors of ideas, but they're awful judges of consequence. You see an atomic bomb and think death and destruction; I see an end to a seemingly insurmountable conflict. You see the Black Death and think of endless misery; I see an effective solution to overpopulation.\n\nIs this making more sense, now, Mr. Bond? I know your organization sent you here to thwart my company's progress. I know they would rather I use my research to save this world, rather than take a select few to colonize another. And I could - yes, I could apply my terraforming technology to extract the carbon from the Earth's atmosphere. Buy the population another few hundred years, perhaps.\n\nBut I choose not to. Human beings are a cancer upon their homeland. A parasite. A pest. Your world is a sinking ship. I am in a position to save it, but instead I choose to forsake it, for the greater good of your species.\n\nSometimes, however painful it may be, a fresh start is necessary. This is no different from before. Throughout history, there have been times when the course of humanity has needed a little...\"\n\n Elon paused for effect.\n\n\"*Rearranging*.\"",

Wincing in pain at the laser searing his flesh, he used his chin to run the beam over his restraints, freeing his arm. He reached for the dashboard..\n\nA great jolt slammed Bonds head forward. Reeling, he registered the booster separation just long enough to avoid blacking out. His arm rose and punched the central screen with its cruel DONT PANIC message. What appeared was a very different pair of words. Aston Martin.\n\nThe internal cameras saw the Tesla shimmer and warp as the repurposed cloaking system of the Aston Martin Vantage revealed the true nature of the vehicle. Wires shot out, taking over the core booster's control system and self destruct.\n\nThe rocket spun round under Bonds control, crushing him against the side of the vehicle. As it began to change course, he set the destination as Musk's luxurious mansion/Galactic Command Centre.\n\nBond punched the button to release the payload fairing, wondering how he would ever explain this to Q.\n\nThe car  radio crackeled to life. Musk. \"Bond you FOOL! What are you doing. Do you think this will stop ME! MARS IS MINE!

Bond sat in the car as he listened to the radio. \"Launching in sixty seconds.\" Bond sprang into action. He slipped one of the boots in the suit off his foot with a good shake, revealing the knife hidden within. He grabbed the knife with his toes, dexterously spun it around and cut away at the straps on his legs. Now that his legs were free, he kicked out the windshield in front of him with his fully booted foot. The glass showered around Bond, and a large shard fell conveniently next to his right hand. He grabbed it with his fingers, and began cutting at the bonds around his hands. With a hefty snap, Bond was free of the straps. \"Thirty seconds until launch.\" \n\nBond opened the car'a driver door, and nearly fell onto the floor of the rocket. He jumped down to the floor, knife in hand. He then began probing for an exit. He did this so long he began to hear the launch countdown. \"T-10. 9. 8.-\" he found a latch. He opened it, quickly unscrewing bolts keeping the patch in place. Inside the latch were electronic controls, labeled 'Rocket Override Controls' Bond quickly mashed the stop button. \"3. 2. 1. Liftoff.\" The rocket began to lurch upwards. Applause filled Bonds space helmet. \"Did you really think I would make it so easy to stop the rocket, Mr. Bond?\" *Click*. The radio was silent. Bond tore open the false controls in anger, revealing wires upon wires. He slashed the wires open, stopping any electricity from going through.\n\n\"Wait, why did the camera feed go dark?\" Elon Musk exclaimed quickly. A man burst into the room. \"We've lost control of the rocket.\" Elon blinked, and then went outside. The rocket was high in the air, but also leaning hard. When it seemed to be going sideways, Elon saw a dark parachute open in the bright sky. \"He escaped, but how?\" Elon asked.",

But I always thought it would be cool to say that,\" replied Elon Must in a snide yet humorous tone. \n\nElon Musk continued walking down the hallway to the control room in the opposite direction. He couldn't wait to make the announcement to the world. \n\nHow did we get here? Well, by now we all know we didn't just arrive at this moment overnight. Elon Musk was never known to be particularly vindictive or violent, but that Twitter war started by Donald \"Cadet bonespurs\" - oops, J. - Trump was pushed him over the edge. \n\nOpinion polls started to cover the public feud months ago, just as it seemed the Russia investigation was ready to charge Trump. By then, it had already heated up and had the public's attention. People were already on the street mobilized, protesting the \"President\" after he found a way to fire Mueller and stop the probe. Maybe Cadet Bonespurs (finally, a nickname stuck, thanks to Senator Duckworth) thought another fight on social media would draw press and conversation away from what he had done if he escalated the altercation with Elon. Nobody really knows what goes through the mind of a madman, though. \n\nWhen the marches started, fivethirtyeight.com had opinion polls tracking his approval rate at 23% and his disapproval rate at 73%. The numbers for the Trump-Elon bout were worse. And they continued to tank every day until this moment. Headlines were entirely in Elon's favor with titles such as \"Musk Defends All Africans, Black and While Trump Pro-Apartheid Comments Ignite Rocket Fuel\" - and they were becoming daily, when they weren't focused on impeachment or the Mueller firing. Americans were angry, apart from his racist base. \n\nMusk thought about everything Trump had done and said that led to this decision, to kidnap Trump and launch him into space on a one-way trip. He thought about the possible consequences and reactions over the past month as he customized this latest Space X rocket, fitted with 4k HD screens that would broadcast every second in every angle pre- during and post-launch. He was every bit as calculating as he had been and knew he was right, the last thing Cadet Bonespurs would ever hear would be applause from Earth.\n\nA smile crossed his face. He had relaxed while reliving these thoughts over the past 45 minutes while final preparations were made. The military, FBI and all other federal agencies didn't even attempt to breach Space X's property. Now he was ready to push the button. \n\nHe opened communications with Cadet Bonespurs one more time, \"Hey, make sure you wave to our employees on the moon and Mars when you pass by! Yes, they're already there. At least you got one thing right, but nobody will ever know!\" \n\nThis last remark sent Trump into a rage. But he was trapped. Opening broadcast communications required a hand size of at least 7.44 inches to be scanned. Alas, nobody could hear his screams. But he knew it was true! He knew it was a conspiracy! \n\nExcept, it wasn't. It was just Elon Musk once again outmaneuvering Trump's tiny brain and tiny hands. He knew Trump would believe anything at this point. \n\nIt took Elon another minute to contain himself and stop laughing. Tears welled up in his eyes as he watched the Cadet. Then he pushed the button. \n\n\"We have liftoff,\" messaged the control tower. All Trump could hear were cheers and applause.",

He paused, and lowered his voice to almost a whisper. \n\n\"You have failed me for the last time, Professor.  Goodbye.\"\n\nNumber 2's hand slipped beneath the table, and pressed a hidden button. \n\nThe floor slid open,  exposing a boiling pool of man eating piranha.  The man in the jump suit tumbled forward.   The water soon became a reddish soup of flesh.\n\nNumber 2 smiled.   \"I hope the school enjoys their meal. \"  \n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "\"Musk\" Bond spat.\n\n\"Well fancy seeing you here all dressed up for the occasion\" smirked Elon in reply, \"You were getting uncomfortably close to the truth you know. You're right about the the solar cells, but I don't think you quite comprehend the genius of the boring company\".\n\nJames took a quick glance around the sterile room. Five white suited assistants stood several meters away, flamethrowers levelled at him, while further back a hive of workers quietly rushed around.\n\nBond shook his head as he surreptitiously inched his hand towards the seatbelt release. \"You know you won't get away with this; MI6 know what you're up to.\"\n\n\"Famous last words Mr Bond! But I know in this case you're wrong: that coded message you sent back to the Queen? Turns out that's my satellite it was supposed to be bouncing off.\"\n\nBond slammed his hand on the seatbelt release and leapt towards Elon, only for the suit to promptly stop him halfway.\n\n\"James, James, James\", Musk explained, \"I'm disappointed! I'm an A-class villain, not one of your usual B-grade menagerie. You simply won't get out of this, your suit is literally part of the seat cushion\". Musk leaned over the door and opened the glove box with a flourish. \"No fancy gadgets here to help I'm afraid: we took your flamethrower - nice design by the way, I think I might commercialize it - although you can have this towel... maybe it will keep you warm up there?\"\n\nBond grunted in effort as he twisted his head to look at Elon\n\n\"Not going to crush the car with me in it? To conventional? Not enough R&amp;D involved?\" James baited, frantically trying to devise an escape plan.\n\n\"Oh no, you're much more special than that. You're going to be in the greatest show on earth... or off earth\". A small chuckle. \n\nBond stared back blankly as he tested the car pedals in the desperate hope they would do something.\n\n\"You're going to be strapped onto three leaky pipe bombs and sent to Mars!\" Musk concluded with a sideways grin.\n\n*****\n\n\"Four... Three... Two... One... and lift-off of the Falcon Heavy\" announced a voice in the dark, the muffled cheers merging into the background roar of the engines far below.\n\nJames was familiar with rocket launches, and as far as they went this was actually quite gentle. Even so, he knew there was no time to waste if he was to stop Elon's dastardly plan. \n\nDespite being pitch black inside the payload bay he easily found an angle where the suit seemed to strain, and using his arm as a lever was rewarded with the pops of seam stitches breaking at his shoulder.\n\n\"Beginning pitchover\", the bodiless voice continued.\n\nJames was flung forwards as the rocket suddenly pitched, and the whole sleeve of the suit sheared off with a rip. \n\n\"How very handy\" James muttered as he tossed the arm and glove away.\n\nThe darkness was broken by the smug visage of Elon appearing on the car screen. \"You know it was 50/50 as to whether you'd be barbecued by now so I'd say you're doing pretty well all things considered\"\n\nJames ignored him and instead worked on unzipping the three layered suit and sliding out. He gave it a fond pat on the helmet as he reached over into the glove box. \"I'm sorry though, you're just not suitable\".\n\nGrabbing the towel he opened the car door and stepped carefully onto the payload adapter, feet feeling the way in the darkness.\n\n\"Stage one propulsion is nominal\"\n\nThe vibrations were reaching their crescendo as Bond quickly reached back into the car and turned the headlights on, flooding the fairing with light. \n\n\"Very clever, but don't bother trying the handbrake, you'll find it doesn't work!\" Elon's cheery voice was noticeably quieter as the air continued to rush out of the vents into the vacuum outside. It was getting hard to breathe as James slid down the conical mount onto the compartment floor. He looked around despondently at the blank walls as the atmosphere got thinner.\n\n\"Max Q\"\n\nJames cursed. \"Of course! Q!\" he took his socks off and placed one on each of the fairing locks, before spitting on each and retreating. The special edition thermite socks burst into flames where his saliva had hit, melting through the mechanism holding the fairing halves together. The air pressured plummeted as the fairing went spinning back towards the earth, revealing the pure black of the sky and the deep blue of the ocean far below. \n\nThe acceleration was becoming difficult as Bond tied the towel to the hinge hook and lowered himself down onto the top of a side booster, nearly blacking out from the effort and lack of oxygen. His lungs struggled to draw air in as he flopped on the top of the nosecone. \"Time... to.. stop.. worrying.. and.. learn.. to... love..\"...\n\n*****\n\nJames woke to a warm foot and a singeing smell. He tried to move his leg away from the edge but an invisible giant was pinning it, along with the rest of him, firmly in place against the shuddering nosecone. The force abruptly stopped and was replaced with a loud hiss and... stillness? Bond slowly wormed his way to the peak and looked around. Sure enough, he was back on planet earth. Unfortunately 200ft above it, and with a convoy of SpaceX vehicles kicking up a trail of dust as they bounced towards him. \n\nHe stomped on the nose, trying to break through the carbon fibre shell. He'd only managed to make a small dent by the time the army of Teslas arrived, spilling out dozens of young engineers and a few menacing security guards armed with flamethrowers. Finally a brand new midnight cherry Roadster came screaming up to the base of the rocket and Musk furiously leapt over the door. He grabbed a bullhorn and started shouting.\n\n\"You just stay right there Bond! Don't try anything smart. Some fool engineer must have loaded you into the wrong core, yes, that has to be it.\"\n\nHis ranting was soon drowned out by the sound of an approaching helicopter. It buzzed around Bond a few times before slowly advancing.\n\n\"Need a lift?\"\n\n\"Felix, you old dog! I don't want to impose.\", Bond replied\n\n\"Just get in Bond. So who is that anyway?\"\n\nThey paused to listen to Musk:\n\n\"If you don't come down right this instant I'll open fire!\"\n\n\"It's a long story Felix, longer than we have if we don't get moving soon\". Bond waved cheerily at Musk as he finished climbing in; \"time to go and expose you\"\n\n\"No! Open fire\" shouted Musk, aiming at the helicopter but only spraying the base of the rocket. Fire slowly licked up the side as the helicopter ascended, before one of the legs gave a groan and gave out. Elon rushed over and tried to brace the still burning core but ever so slowly the whole tube tipped over and exploded in a painful flash of light and heat.\n\n\"I guess that must have been a bit too *heavy* for him\"\n\n*****\n\nYes: I stole the first line from the highest rated story! Sorry /u/ecstaticandinsatiate\n\nIt's also my first time writing - please give me feedback.",

            "comment": "You know that feeling you get, when you think you're alone, head down, bumming along doing your own thing, when you suddenly realise someone's been there the whole time, watching you? It's a jump, a kick-start, a burst of adrenaline... your whole body saying \"something's not right, be on guard\". You immediately begin to second guess you actions, what was I doing, how did I miss them, what are their intentions? It's a deep, primal, animalistic response to being startled. \n\nThat's the feeling I got when I caught a glimpse of the flag the first time. \n\nThere I am, one of 3 people on an entire planet, scouting for physical evidence of ancient river beds. We'd been here for 4 Earth days at this point, so I was used to the un-exciting terrain. Rocks and dust everywhere. Red and black and brown, endlessly in all directions. I had come around a small rocky hill, scanning this horizon, when there it was to my left, a flag-pole. \n\nI think I did a double-take. Half \"that's a flag-pole\", half \"THAT'S A FLAG POLE.\" I stopped dead in my tracks and re-evaluated my position. I was on Mars. There were 3 of us. Nobody had ever, ever, ever been here before. None of my crew-members had been out this way. But yet... that was distinctly a flag pole. As I approached it, the wind kicked up and revealed the tattered remains of a cold war era Soviet flag... had to be at least 100 years old. My mind was still trying to wrap itself around why this was here, and my body was telling me to run. My hands felt sweaty and my breathing was heavy.  At the base of the flag was a black cube, about a foot each dimension. It had handprints set into two sides. \n\nMy curiosity got the better of me. At this point, I really should have radioed into my team to tell them what I had found. I should have marked the location on my nav-map, and retreated, to be explored later. I shouldn't have touched the box. But I did. I placed my hands where the outlines were on each side, and as I did, my head exploded. \n\nIt was like a shot of light stabbing me in the eyes. A searing pain gripping my entire body. Unholy screams tearing through my ears. Unable to breath, unable to move, it felt like I was being compressed into a marble and torn into a billion pieces at the same time. The event lasted for what seemed like a lifetime, and then... it just stopped. I was left with an understanding. Knowledge. Somehow, the cube had implanted a lesson in me, instantaneously. I knew why the Soviet flag was here. I knew why the Russians had never claimed any great accomplishment on Mars. I knew why the cube was here. It was a warning, a last ditch effort by humanity of old to save us from ourselves. I knew it all to be true. \n\nThe solar system had been seeded with life by a passing comet several billion years ago. Earth, Mars, and a third planet between Mars and Jupiter, understood as \"Utopia\" in the transfer. Similar life forms evolved on each of the planets, but Humanity had evolved on Utopia within the last several hundred thousand years. Over time, humanity had reached the point of being able to visit the other two worlds, and had begun to establish small colonies for research. \n\nOver time, Mars would become more heavily populated. Earth was the sore thumb of the trio, with the least favourable environment, and was therefore left to the scientists to poke and prod at, never a plan for full colonization. Mars became a second arm of the human civilization, growing larger and attaining it's own identity. Political strife created a rift between Mars and Utopia, and eventually, war. War that would last 1,000 years. War that was so engrained into the minds of the Martians and the Utopians, that they did not know another existence. War that was taken to such extremes, that when the Utopians began the irreversible process of syphoning Mars' atmosphere, the Martians blew up Utopia. I could feel the pain of billions of lives lost, as though I was there to witness the events unfold. \n\nThe remnants of humanity that were able to escape Mars left for Earth, and left behind the cubes as a reminder of what once was, and a warning that there were no more second chances. Earth is all there is left. \n\nThe history books will tell you that America won the Cold War. But I now understood the truth... the Soviets had won, and they had won by silently backing down for the good of humanity. There would be no second chance, we were already living it. ",

Book 1: majorly fleshed out version of this story. Book 2 and onward: back in time to get to know the Utopians and Martians, see the conflicts, the war, the move to earth, how they colonised and organized earth, how many times people \"in the know\" changed/influenced historical events and why, etc. Gahhh your idea has so much potential!\n\nAnyway, really really great job, this should definitely be number 1 in the thread.",

            "comment": "The door was built into the side of a cliff, but about a foot of Martian dust had accumulated in front of the step. A red square was emblazoned on the front, with the yellow image of a hammer and sickle right in the center. Years of sand-blasting storms had taken their toll, chipping away at the edges of the paint until it was jagged and faded. Only the slightest outline of the letters \"CCCP\" were still visible.\n\n\u201cDefinitely Russian,\u201d Commander Davis radioed back to the Mars habitat facility. \u201cSoviet Era.\u201d That had been the working theory ever since the door had been identified in one of the rover\u2019s photos, but no one had been sure until now. The Russians had steadfastly denied that they\u2019d made it to Mars, much less that they\u2019d established some sort of colony. But who else could it have been? Who else had a secretive space program?\n\nThe hatch was locked, of course. \u201cShould we knock?\u201d Rodriguez joked. Commander Davis gave the door a hearty pound, but no one answered. Their drill, originally built to excavate soil samples, wasn\u2019t exactly equipped to cut through solid steel. Instead, they bore holes through the red rocks around the hinges until it crumbled apart and the door came crashing down. The airlock was dark and silent. \n\nDavis and the crew entered the facility. The winding hallway descended deep under the mountain. They passed by room after room, full of bunk beds for sleeping and a large cafeteria with neatly stacked trays. Some of them held computers larger than the rover they\u2019d driven over here. There was an entire floor of greenhouses, now just full of withered stalks and brown soil. \n\n\u201cWhat do you think happened here?\u201d Hatfield asked, shining his flashlight on a teddy bear that had been abandoned in the hallway.\n\nFinally, the expedition found the colony's inhabitants in some sort of large gathering space, like an auditorium. The door was sealed from the outside, with no escape. Through a thick window covered in scratch marks, Commander Davis could see decaying bodies in red jump suits. Some were holding others in one last embrace. Others were apparently trying to escape through some sort of vent, with little luck. \n\n\u201cCommander?\u201d Norvolisk, the only member of the crew who could read Cyrillic, trained his flashlight beam on a sign. \u201cThis hallway leads to the General\u2019s office, it says.\u201d \n\nThis door also had a lock, strong enough to be a bank vault. But it was open. There was a single body at the desk with a pistol in hand and a hole through the forehead. Also on the desk were a stack of journals, each marked with dates ranging from 1963 to 2002.\n\n\u201cDay 1,\u201d Norvolisk read aloud. \u201cThe Soviet Republic of Mars is hereby established with the purpose of keeping the People\u2019s Revolution alive even in the event of catastrophic war on Earth. Should the Americans learn of this installation, we would most certainly be a target for attack, and cannot live on the surface in plain view. Therefore, my crew of two hundred is busy hollowing out this living space\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cHow in the hell could they establish an off-world colony without us knowing?\u201d \n\nThe journal that Norvolisk was reading started listing off what supplies they\u2019d brought with them, which (while interesting) was really not the question on everyone\u2019s mind right now. He dropped that and picked up the most recent one, last dated March 21, 2002. \n\n\u201cAfter 12 years since the last reply from Earth,\u201d the final entry read, \u201cI am forced to conclude the worst: there has been a nuclear war, and our comrades are destroyed. The replacement parts for the water recycler will never arrive. Even this failsafe colony will not be enough to keep the human race alive. Instead, we will all die of dehydration. Faced with that consequence, I had no choice but to exercise Protocol 92 and terminate the colony in a quick and relatively painless way. The gas was deployed at approximately 16:00. Their screams\u2026\u201d There was a tremor in Norvolisk\u2019s voice as he read the entry. The page was spattered with small flecks of blood. \u201cTheir screams will haunt me even after I take my own life. Should humanity ever rise from the ashes and return to the red planet, know that we tried. Long live Father Lenin and the People\u2019s Revolution.\u201d \n\n-----\n\nAs always, subscribe to /r/Luna_Lovewell for tons of other stories!

Many unconventional technologies are ignored because people don't understand them or aren't interested in them. Many of Tesla's inventions and ideas haven't been tested/implanted after his lifetime because they just haven't \"caught on\". I occasionally see small, crowd sourced experimentation here and there, though.  But he had plans to provide wireless electricity across the Atlantic ocean, and swore it could be done; it makes you wonder why it never actually happened. Either it was impossible and this genius guy was somehow wrong (though he was rarely wrong about his inventions), or it is possible and nobody else could figure out how to actually implement it.\n\nGranted Tesla was an eccentric fellow who dreamed big, but he was a genius who could design and simulate inventions in his head that were beyond his time. If he was still alive, I'm sure we would be leaps and bounds ahead in our technology and processes.",

One example was a [completely passive bug hidden in a gift of a wood carving of the US seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_(listening_device)) that was presented to the ambassador. It was designed by a guy named Theremin...yes the same guy who made that weird musical instrument.\n\nThe Soviets would hit the bug with an external radio signal, the resonator inside the bug would modulate it as the sound waves in the room changed the capacitance of the bug, and another demodulator would receive and record the results. This worked for *seven years* before it was found.\n\nI think what would be more likely is a kind of telemetry stenography that included a very simple semaphore sort of signaling system. Use a deep space relay network and a low-mars-orbit passive relay station. All the radio traffic earth received would look like it was normal scientific traffic to/from the CCCP's Deep Space Network. Just signals that look like probes indicating fault codes or system checks. Normal deep space mission noise.\n\nEven more clever would be introducing interference into the transmissions of probes the USA put on Mars or in Mars orbit. That sounds like a more Soviet thing to do.\n\nIn any case, I'm sure messages and progress reports coming from the emergency Soviet Mars outpost would be few and far between until a point-to-point laser network or something like it could be established. Radio silence would probably be suggested if not mandatory.\n\nAs others have said the replies probably would be something like UVB-76. Just another series of numbers coming at a predetermined time from a number station.",

And as someone else mentioned, The journal being dated 12 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Wonderful little details that novels sometimes fail to include.\n\nI truly got a feeling of what all of the characters were going through. I can see Norvalisk, Rodriguez, Davis, and Hatfield. And I can feel the pain of the Soviet General.\n\nAll in 12 paragraphs. Well done.",

Nothing to write home about nowadays. \n\nThe Soyuz capsule on the other hand is very impressive and, in my opinion, unparalleled. The shape of its re-entry capsule is the biggest reason why the Russians managed to not only get away with still using it half a century after its initial flight, but indeed makes it the best option for human LEO flight to date.\n\nThe re-entry capsule is shaped in such a way that (in a fix) allows it to perform a full re-entry procedure without guidance computers, ground comms, or anything. In the event of a total systems failure, the aerodynamic forces alone keep its orientation aligned properly with its flight path, so if any vital systems fail, the cosmonauts aboard still have a fighting chance. The capsule is resistant to tumbling (and burning up) like an Apollo CM or a Space Shuttle would, i.e. the Soyuz capsule doesn't absolutely require active steering. It *does* work without, though it's a more dangerous and less comfortable landing. That's the genius of Korolyov's design, and it's the primary design reason for its continuing service. (There are economic and political reasons, too, of course. Space travel and development is expensive and requires stability.)\n\nThis is what makes me skeptical about SpaceX's crew Dragon. Musk does not strike me as the kind of guy who thinks through every eventuality, which is reflected in that his capsule uses touch screens for most controls, while only a few vital operations are reserved for mechanical switches. I don't believe he is prepared for Murphy's Law, and it's probably gonna bite him and a couple of astronauts in the ass eventually.",

            "comment": "\"Well I'll be damned.....\" Captain Aldo whistled softly as his team approached the abandoned vehicle. He had seen the images from the Mars rover but did not truly believe it until now. The machine bore the symbol of Communist Russia, standing alone in defiance of a world which destroyed all life. It would seem, he would not actually go down in history as the first man on Mars.\n\n\"Kinda spooky if you ask me.\" Johannes muttered under her breath as she looked inside. \"According to our satellite images their spacecraft was left over 60 miles to the west of here. So where the hell did the cosmonauts go? Why did they keep all this secret even years after the cold war?\" It was decided that they would not alert the Russians of the fact that they had discovered their presence on Mars. Naturally, they announced to the world their mission to put a man on Mars but the Russia government never said a word. After all, a world is a big place to hide.\n\n\"That is what we are here to find out, the vehicle isn't the only thing our rover found here.\" Their Captain walked about 20 yards from the vehicle then began to stomp the ground. He was soon rewarded by a metal clang, a trap door covered from years of storms. The rover was not capable of opening the door, this was the real reason his team was sent.  \n\nIt took the entire team to open it, once they wiped off the dust, the found foreign markings across it's surface. The inside was dark with the exception of a single low light which let out a soft hum. Below, they found the missing cosmonauts. Unfortunately, they had all died a long time ago.\n\n\"Welcome back creators.\" A voice sounded in the dark. Aldo jumped and Martinez let out a shriek. \n\n\"It has been 36 years and thirty-two days since the last creators arrived.\" The computer voice did not seem to take notice of their uneasiness and continued speaking. \"I am pleased to report that there have been no incidents since the last report. Although there has been no further communication from the creator fleet, Project Godmaker is still running as scheduled.\"\n\nThere was a silence, the computer seemed to be waiting for something. Hesitantly, Aldo finally spoke in a shaky voice.\n\n\"You......were made by the Soviet's?\"\n\n\"Searching..............negative. This unit was not made by the creators who last visited known as Soviet's. This unit is property of the Creator fleet special project and research division. Please provide authentication code.\"\n\nAldo looked closer now at the computer, the rest of the room was dark but the computer gave enough light to see everything else. It had multiple screens, all running the current events of what was happening back on earth. Some of which were news but others were views from cameras that merely showed street corners and mundane activities.\n\n\"Please provide authentication code.\" The computer stated once again. There wasn't any change in the way the computer sounded but Aldo almost imagined he heard a slightly impatient tone.\n\n\"What are you-\" Aldo was cut off as the trap door swung closed, red lights began to blink and a siren wailed. Johannes ran to the door and tried to open. \"It's sealed captain!\" She shouted with heavy breaths as she pounded against it.\n\n\"ERROR.\" The computer responded in a booming voice. \"ERROR, authentication not provided. According to protocol 67 of Project Godmaker, test subjects must not become aware of outside presence. All systems will go offline until intruder presence has been eliminated. Filing second report with Creator Fleet for cleanup.\"\n\nThen it went dark.\n\nEdit: Referring to modern Russia as Soviet's\n\n \n\n ",

            "comment": "\"This..this can't be what I think it is, can it?\"\n\nJenkins voice was breathy and a little scared through my comm. There was also a low buzzing noise, probably some kind of static. I looked down at the three bodies and the red and yellow flag on the cave floor.\n\n\"I don't know what else it could be.\" I responded. \n\nThe Soviet flag was small, only about a foot across and half a foot high. Payload used to be expensive, back in the bad old days, so I wasn't surprised. The bodies though...\n\nThey weren't wearing any clothing, but scraps of what looked like old suits clung to their flesh. They were not in good shape. There were massive growths over most of their skin and something else...\n\n\"They look like they are all connected to each other. Like there is some kind of, I don't know, umbilical cord connecting each one to the other.\" Jenkins said. \"Carmichael, we have to find a way to report this.\" \n\nThe buzzing was a little louder now.\n\nOur Earth-range radio had stopped working shortly after we had established the small forward base. We couldn't find anything technically wrong with the equipment, but Jenkins had managed to trace some kind of signal coming from this cave. We had come out here to investigate, not knowing what we were going to find. \n\nThe cave was shallow and we didn't see any technology.\n\n\"Can you sweep for the signal? Try to find where it's coming from? I don't see any machines. And what the hell is that noise?\"\n\nThis buzzing was starting to become irritating.\n\nJenkins held up his small receiver and swung his arm slowly from one rocky wall to the other. Then he hesitated. I could see, even through the tinted facemask, that something was wrong.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"Hold on. This...oh shit.\" He said, bringing the receiver to rest in front of the Russian cosmonauts bodies.\n\nI swallowed. \"It's coming from them, isn't it?\"\n\nI don't know what Jenkins said in response, because suddenly the buzz became much louder. It was all I could hear. I cut the speaker in my helmet. It didn't matter, I still heard it.\n\nSuddenly, Jenkins doubled over, and a long line of the red Martian dust that covered the floor exploded upwards between the nearest cosmonaut and him. His suit split open in a line from his boot to above his knee. A pulsing tendril of flesh, exactly like the ones that connected the Russians to each other, now connected him to them. \n\nI tried to back out, but my right foot wouldn't move. Something was connecting it to the ground. Guess what that was. The buzzing ceased to be a drone, and became the language we're using to talk to you now.\n\nThat's how we came to be where you found us. That's how the ones who come to find you will be. We were expecting more after the first three, but according to Carmichael's memories, they must have lacked the funds to follow up on their first mission. We only need a few more now for critical mass. Then, we will bring Unity to your world, as we brought it to this one.\n\nStop struggling. It will soon cease to hurt. Pain is a burden we will reject together. Until then, we will all be quiet, and wait.",

I volunteered to go check it out, though we all knew what it was - and when I'd just confirmed it.\n\nA Soviet flag.\n\nWhy hadn't they told us? I'd heard rumour of a Soviet mission, decades back, but we'd written it off as Cold War propaganda. If they'd actually managed to get to Mars, even if they didn't get them back - that would be humanity's greatest accomplishment. \n\n*Why hadn't they told us?*\n\nWhat could it mean? Had the Russkies simply lost contact and assumed the worst? That didn't make any sense, since if they landed intact enough to erect the flag, they must have been in communication with them back home...\n\nSomething was wrong. I needed to get back.\n\nI tried to make contact with the boys back at the ship, but there was no reply. Figured I was out of range, but that didn't make sense. Brushed it aside; nerves were getting the better of me, and there was no use worrying about something I couldn't change.\n\nSaw my team in the distance. It was immensely comforting; you've never known isolation till you're alone on a new planet. I quickened my pace.\n\nStill radio silence. I just wanted to get back to the ship.\n\nNearing them now.

Why were they just standing there?\n\nStill no response. Why aren't they coming out to meet me? Why are they just *standing* there?\n\nI can see their suits properly now. Coated in sand. Weatherworn. And why... why do they look like they're a different colour underneath? Are those- are those *Soviet* suits? *Why are they just standing there?*\n\nWait.

            "comment": "\"Jackson, do you copy?  I repeat do you copy?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I'm here, keep your panties on, Tex.\"  Commander Tripp Jackson said as he fiddled with the radio controls on his wrist computer. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I'm getting some strange readings coming from the northeast.  Possibly from that crater up over that ridge, ya' might want to steer clear.\"\n\nJackson scoffed, \"Tex, this is an exploration mission, checking out weird readings is kind of what we're here for.\"  He looked to the rest of his crew behind him.  Lieutenant Rickles, his science officer, was crouched beside her sample digger ever engrossed in its readouts, while Lieutenant Kraskov stood beside her.  Kraskov, even though he was wearing a spacesuit and was the sixth man on Mars, still somehow managed to look bored.\n\nJackson shuffled towards them, the gravity on mars still took some getting used to, his feet kicking up plumes of orange-red dust.  He keyed his local mics.  \"Hey guys, Mickelson is chewing my ear off about some strange readings just over that ridge,\" He said while pointing, \"I say we go check 'em out.\"\n\nRickles glanced down at her wrist and then back to the readout on the digging machine, which rumbled and spat out dust as its auger bored into the Martian crust.  \"Just about done here Commander.  Our itinerary is clear for the next 45 minutes; Mission Control likes to give us some time to 'enjoy the sights.'\"\n\nJackson chuckled lightly to himself, that woman was only concerened with her experiments.  He himself was interested in the concentration of things like nitrogen in the soil, or how the Martian gravity effected certain things, but she was obsessed.  It was her job though, and she did it well.\n\n\"About time,\" Kraskov grunted, as he shuffled away from Rickles' experiment and towards the ridge, \"Too much science, not enough exploring.\"\n\nJackson waited as Rickles' finished tapping away on the digger's output screen.  She confirmed that the information had transferred to her wrist computer and stood.  Stretching out her legs she glanced over at Jackson.  He gestured towards the ridge, where Kraskov had already started lumbering up, and they both began their way towards it.\n\n  \"What kind of readings?\"  Rickles asked.\n\n\"Mickleson didn't-\" Jackson began before being interrupted.\n\n\"I'm gettin' strange readings on a lot of my intstruments.  From spikes of power on nearby sensors, centering on that area, to bursts of gravity change.\" Mickelson said in his southern drawl.\n\n\"You're saying there's some kind of electrical discharge over there?\"  Kraskov asked, his speech slightly labored from the climb up the ridge.\n\n\"Nah, nah,\" Mickelson replied, \"When a bunch of my readings start goin' haywire, it just means somethin's causing interference.  Could be a large deposit of magnetite, could be a Martian with a ray gun, ya' just never know.\"\n\nJackson watched as Rickles' shook her head as they came upon the slope of the crater.  It wasn't exactly difficult to move or climb in the Martian gravity, hell, they had hundreds of hours in training with dealing with the lessened gravity, but the real thing was different.  They both began their slow ascent, following in the tracks of Kraskov, who had disturbed the soil ahead of them.\n\nThe radio squelched to life, \"Uh, Commander?\" Kraskov's voice emanated from the speakers in Jackson's helmet.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Jackson said.\n\n\"There's definitely something strange in here.\"\n\n\"Be there in a second.\"\n\nRickles and Jackson trudged their way up, to where Kraskov stood at the top of the ridge, looking down and into the crater.  The view was magnificent.  The crater was decently sized, but not big enough to where it just became part of the landscape.  Jackson could see the ridge of the crater curve away in front of him, contrasting with the hazy orange of the horizon before sloping down into the classic bowl shape.  \n\nDown in the middle of the bowl, Jackson expected to see rocks.  This wasn't the first crater they had explored, as Mars was littered with meteor strikes.  They hadn't expected this one to be here though, as he had memorized the general layout of their work area, and this one wasn't on the map.\n\nThere was something metallic glinting in the sun in the center of the crater, they were still too far away to make out many details but Jackson could make out sharp angles on the metallic object.  Jackson shrugged as he looked between his two companions.  \"Welp, not going to see anything from up here.  Let's get going.\"\n\n They started down the slope, Jackson leading the way, Kraskov and Rickles following in his footsteps, sending billows of loose dust down around his ankles and down the slope.\n\n\"What's going...  Comman... ackson.\" The radio coughed through the speakers.\n\n\"Tex, I'm losing you.  There's something down in the crater and we're checking it out.\" Jackson replied.\n\n\"Read... interfer..\" the radio crackled and then became silent again.\n\n\"Too much interference,\" Kraskov said, \"the radio shouldn't be this weak, even heading down into the crater.  We're out of line of sight of the antenna, but it should be strong enough to overcome that.\"\n\nJackson grunted as he scrambled over a large boulder and the slope of the crater eased away.  They were closer to the object now and could make out details.  It was roughly egg shaped, but only constructed in sharp angles.  It was made out of some kind of grey metal, which shone brightly in the sun. As they approached it loomed up and over them.\n\n\"Its got to be at least fifteen feet tall.\" Kraskov said, \"damn, how did the overhead satellites not pick this up?\"\n\nThey approached slowly and Kraskov slowly circled around the large object.  \n\"Nothing on the other side,\" He said as he came back into view, \"same angles, no hatch, console or anything.\"\n\nRickles had her arm lifted as she recorded the object with the wrist mounted computer. \"I've never seen anything like this,\" she said, \"and I'm not getting any readings.  Whatever caused the abnormalities earlier definitely isn't showing up on my sensors.\n\nJackson took a few steps closer to the object and reached out his gloved hand.\n\n\"Commander, are you sure that's safe?\" Rickles asked apprehension in her voice.\n\n\"We're on a planet 54 million kilometers from home Rickles, not much out here is safe.\" He replied.   \n\nHe squeezed his gloved hand closed and open a few times before brushing his fingers against the sharp angled metal.\n\n\nNothing happened.  \n\n\"Huh, well that was a disapp-\" Kraskov started, before the entire structure rotated half an inch, showering them with loose dust that had collected on it.\n\nJackson hopped back and stumbled his way backwards away from the object.  It slowly rotated another couple inches before coming to a rest.\n\n\"Whoa,\" Jackson said, \"I think I woke it up.\"\n\nIt stood quiet for a few moments before each of its sharp angles turned into creases.  Gaps formed in the angles and widened.  Chunks of metal began falling off the object, starting from the top of the egg shape, clattering their way down and landing in clouds of orange dust.  Soon the chunks became larger until massive sections of the egg had fallen away, and the object was no more, only debris spread out before them.\n\nIn the middle of the debris field was a round metal platform, sunk a few inches into the Martian soil.  Centered exactly in the center of the platform was another large metal egg, at least ten feet tall, but this time it was perfectly smooth, balanced perfectly on its base.\n\n\"What is that?\" Rickles said breathlessly.\n\nJackson took a few steps closer, weaving his way through the debris of sharp metal and peered at the egg.   It had a mirror finish, the same grey metal as the previous egg, but this time there was engraving along one section of the egg.\n\nKraskov stepped up beside Jackson and placed a hand on the shoulder of his space suit, and peered closer at the engraving.\n\n\"That...\" He started, gripping Jackson's shoulder tighter, \"That's Russian.\"\n\nJackson could now make out the Russian lettering, above which was an engraving of the old USSR hammer and sickle insignia.\n\n\"What in the world is Russian tech doing on Mars?\" Kraskov asked, glancing at Jackson.\n\nJackson could only shake his head, \"They've only sent orbiters, hell, even China has only sent one rover and that's on the other side of the planet.\" He paused for a second before continuing.  \"Crash, can you read it?\"\n\nKraskov sighed and turned his attention back to the engraving, \"I haven't spoke or read Russian since I was a kid, but I'll give it a shot.\"\n\nHe leaned in closer and brought up a finger, bouncing it along in the air as he combed over the engraving.  Jackson could see his mouth forming silent words through the glass of his visor as he made his way through the script.  Finally he lowered his hand and turned slowly to Jackson.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you're not going to like this...\"\n\n",

Dedicated to the brave cosmonauts that made it possible to reach Mars.\"  He took a breath in and continued, \"There are dates listing past missions, and a brief summation of each mission.\" \n\nKraskov turned back to the engraving and started reading slowly.  \"They start, let's see, thirty two years ago,\" He said, tracing his finger in space above a line of text. \"Russia's first successful Mars landing.\"\n\nHe moved his finger down a line, \"Russia's first temporary colony, twelve years later.\" He moved down another, \"Two years ago, the first baby to be born on Mars...

Not all.\"  He said, \"It, uh...\"\n\n\"Well?\" Jackson asked, \"Spit it out, Crash.\"\n\n\"It,\"He started before sucking in a breath and blowing it out quickly, \"It mentions the destruction of Earth.  Something about a massive war and how Russia's people will persevere without their home.\"\n\nThe three stood silent for a few long beats.\n\n\"What!?\" Rickles exclaimed, \"That's it, this has to be a joke.  Ha, Ha, Mickleson, get back on comms and let's get this over with.  You fooled us, real good one guys.\"\n\nJackson place a hand on her shoulder and gestured at the egg and the debris around them, \"I don't know what this is Rickles, but I don't think its a joke.\"\n\nRickles shrugged his hand off and turned around, began stomping away from the egg and back towards the Habitat shelter.  \"I don't believe it, this is just too far fetched.  I'm going back and demanding answers from Mission Control.  Maybe they have a clue to what's going on.\"\n\nShe had only made it a few more steps away when her helmet speakers came to life.\n\n\"Kelly...\" Jackson's voice wavered to her ears.\n\n\"What?\" Rickles said exasperated, as she turned back towards them, impatient and ready to be done with this mess.\n\n\"Something is happening,\" He said, staring up at the egg.\n\nIn the time it took her to stomp away a few feet the egg had turned from grey, smooth metal, to now what looked like cloudy transparent glass.  She gaped, taking in the view, Kraskov and Jackson standing amid chunks of sharp metal, the egg sitting on the dais, looming above them.\n\nSomething moved within the egg.  Rickles could only make out a cloudy sillhoutte, but it was organic, moving about within the transparent egg.\n\nIt suddenly stopped moving, the bulk of whatever it was inside the egg was concentrated on the side where the three astronauts stood.  Something pressed up against the glass, towards them and a slight crack appeared where it pressed.\n\nJackson and Kraskov took a few slow steps backwards, mindful of not stepping on any of the debris which was littered about the platform.  The egg made a creaking sound, spiderwebs of cracks running along its entire surface.  Then, without any further warning, it exploded into a million shards of glass.  Shards rained down against their spacesuits, glass plinking off their visors.\n\nNone of the three astronauts dared to move, as they stared in horror at the thing which stood in the center of the platform.",

                            "comment": "Rickles turned and ran, her oversized boots kicking up plumes of orange dust up into the vacuum of space.  The dust flitted down around Commander Jackson and Flight Engineer Kraskov\u2019s legs.  The pair stood stark still, not daring to move a muscle. \n\nStanding on the metal circular platform stood a gnarled old man.  He was bent over at the waist, the only thing Jackson could notice was how emaciated he looked.  His spine curved along his bent back, vertebra poking through paper thin flesh. His skin was pulled tight over his bones and joints, as if threatening to tear at any moment.\n\nFor a moment, Jackson thought the man was nothing but some kind of mannequin, or macabre art exhibit, until he moved. Suddenly the man was thrown into movement, one of his gnarled hands fidgeting, fingers closing and opening, arm and wrist moving at odd, uncoordinated angles, the other gripped something tight within its bony twists.  He was wild eyed, looking between Kraskov and Jackson, mouth opening and closing, his head jerking about in spasms.  Jackson could hear faint screams from the man through his helmet, just before he lunged forward towards the two astronauts, hand outstretched toward them.\n\nThe pair jumped backwards as the man careened off the platform and landed on his back in the Martian dust.  He writhed on the ground, staring up at the sky as the liquid in his bulging eyes fizzed and his gnashing scream diminished into nothingness.\n\nJackson turned away, bent over and rested himself on his knees, his legs were quivering and bile rose in his throat.  After a minute or two of deep breathing, he composed himself and stood shakily back up, he turned back to the grizzly scene.\n\nKraskov had not moved, only stared at the now lifeless form of the man, who had curled into a ball, whether by his death throes or by the escape of moisture in his body leaving him a shriveled corpse.  The orange soil thrown about and scattered where the man\u2019s arms had thrashed.\n\n\u201cJesus.\u201d Kraskov muttered, the sudden noise making Jackson jump.\n\n\u201cWhat in the hell was that?\u201d Jackson asked, \u201cI mean, what the hell, man.\u201d\n\nKraskov just glanced at him and shook his head then moved towards the corpse.  Jackson turned and looked for Rickles.  He spotted her at the lip of the crater, sitting on her knees, legs splayed back behind her, shoulders slumped.  He returned his attention to the man and followed Kraskov over.\n\nKraskov was kneeling by the man and inspecting him.  His body was slightly swollen as gas slowly dispersed out of him, and Jackson had to bite back the bile once again.  \n\n\u201cDo you think that was some kind of cryopod?  He must have been in some kind of stasis.\u201d  Kraskov said.\n\n\u201cFuck man, I have no idea.\u201d Jackson replied, all sense of rank and proper etiquette thrown out the window.  \u201cWe just saw a man spontaneously decompress.\u201d\n\nKraskov nodded, his helmet bobbing up and down.  \u201cLooks like he has something here,\u201d He said as he reached down and took a hold of the man\u2019s wrist.  There was something black and square looking clutched between his fingers.  Kraskov pried his finger\u2019s back, they were stiff and popped at weird angles as he did so, retrieved the item and stood back up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything else,\u201d He said scanning the man and then surveying the rest of the crater.  Debris and glass was scattered about the dais, but it stood empty and stark in the otherwise empty crater. Kraskov held out the square object for Jackson to see.  It definitely looked like some kind of technology, but Jackson hadn\u2019t seen anything like it before.  There were a few buttons and dials, but their use was beyond his grasp.\n\nKraskov folded his fingers back around it and dropped his hand.  \u201cI guess I\u2019ll take a look at it when we get back to the Hab.  I think we should get out of here, before anything else shows up.\u201d  He glanced up and towards Rickles, \u201cShe did not take that well.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t blame her.  I would have done the same thing, had my legs actually worked at the time.\u201d\n\nKraskov nodded grimly and they both turned and headed back up the slope of the crater.  \n\n\u201cSo, do you think Mission Control knew anything about this?\u201d Kraskov said, and Jackson could hear him swallow, even through the headset. \u201cLike, they set us down here in this exact spot, so, you know, we could check this stuff out?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Jackson replied as they began the ascent up the crater wall. \u201cI was there for most of the planning, even when we first took satellite imagery of this location for the first time, looking for landing spots.  None of this was here, we wouldn\u2019t have missed that massive metal thing.\u201d\n\nKraskov shook his head, \u201cI just don\u2019t understand, this is entirely too messed up.\u201d\n\nThey trudged along in silence, loose dust spilling down behind them, slowing their process.  Eventually they were only a few feet away from Lieutenant Rickles.  Her shoulders shook and she was slumped out over her knees, the back of her hands lying in the Martian soil.\n\n\u201cKelly,\u201d Jackson said in a soothing voice, \u201cIt\u2019s over now.  We\u2019re getting the hell away from that thing and you don\u2019t ever have to come back.  We\u2019re okay\u2026 It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d\n\nHe continued up the hill, planning on putting his hand on her shoulder and comforting her, when she slowly lifted both her arms, stretching them out and over the crest of the ridge, they shook from her silent sobs.\n\nJackson was confused as he continued up the ridge.  Rickles was a strong woman and what they had seen was shocking, but she had never been the type to break down and give up.  He had been with her during training, she was always the first to get back up and dust herself off, ready for more.  Pushing her limits to be \u2018one of the boys\u2019.   Her behavior, while understandable, was quite out of character.\n\nJackson crested the ridge, his arm outstretched to touch her shoulder, when he saw the sight which lay before him.  His breath caught in his throat as he surveyed the scene.  Hundreds of squat brown domes lay in the expansive flats in front of him.  Once an empty field, that only contained their Mars Roving Vehicle and some science experiments, was now packed to the brim with these domes.\n\nThey were spaced evenly and geometrically, some were larger and even had glass instead of the brown metal which encased most.  Almost all of them were connected by large tubes which looked like airlocks.  Jackson expected to see spacesuits milling around between them, but there wasn\u2019t any movement in the slightest.  Orange dust had piled up between the domes, and up and over the sides in the case of many.  It seemed as if they had come across an abandoned colony.  Whether it was simply abandoned or something more sinister had yet to be seen.\n\nKraskov climbed and took a spot opposite to Jackson, leaving Rickles in-between them, he stared out over the expanse of domes.  Rickles\u2019 voice came to life over their helmet comms.  \n\n\u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d\n\nNeither Kraskov or Jackson could answer her.\n\n----\nLike most authors on here, I have my own subreddit: r/heyagoncho so if you'd like to check it out and read some of my other stories, or if you lose sight of this thread and want to keep reading this, it'll be updated there!\n\n",

They all sat forlornly on the edge of the crest, staring out over the stretch of domes in front of them.  There was only silence between them, other than the occasional buffet of wind against their helmets.  Kraskov turned his body and peered off into the distance behind them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got an incoming storm,\u201d He said.\n\nJackson sighed and stood slowly, brushing the dust off his suit and shaking it out of the soft joints. \u201cWell, come on,\u201d He said, \u201cNo use just sitting here, especially with our O2 running out.  Speaking of which, how are you guys doing?\u201d  \n\nHe helped Rickles up while Kraskov checked his wrist computer.  \u201cI\u2019ve got about 20% left, so, somewhere just shy of two hours.\u201d\n\nRickles checked hers and confirmed the same.\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cLet\u2019s head down there and check things out.\u201d\n\nUp close, the domes were even in more disuse than they looked from up on the ridge.  The metal was old and looked like it had spent decades being pelted by dust and Martian storms.  Jackson ran his glove along it, feeling the pocked metal scrape across his palm.\n\n\u201cSheesh, this does not bode well on our chances of survival.\u201d Kraskov muttered, and Rickles gave him a sideways glance.  He lifted his arms and shrugged.\n\nThey made their way between the domes, the soil was thin and their boots sank easily through it.  The light was beginning to dim, whether by the hour or by the encroaching storm.  One of the larger domes stood before them, darkened glass set in a lattice of the same orange metal made up the roof.\n\n\u201cSome kind of greenhouse?\u201d Rickles asked.\n\n\u201cPossibly,\u201d Jackson said as they circled around the dome, eventually coming upon something that looked like an airlock.  It was a large affair, at least 10 feet tall and 8 across.  Two ribs of metal ran crisscrossed through the metal, possibly adding strength to the door.  Jackson could just barely make out faded paint across the door.  He traced it with a finger, \u201cMore hammer and sickle\u2026 Think anyone is home?\u201d\n\n\u201cGuess we\u2019re going to find out,\u201d Kraskov said, moving to a large panel which stood embedded in the wall next to the airlock.  He tapped at it and ran his fingers along its edges. There were no buttons or levers, it looked like a touch screen. \u201cDead.\u201d He said, letting his hands drop to his sides.\n\nJackson sighed and went to pinch the bridge of his nose in frustration, but his hand bumped off of his visor.  \u201cShould we try the other domes?  See if any of them have working power?\u201d\n\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Kraskov said, \u201cThere might be other ways.\u201d  He ran his hands along the edge of the airlock, sending dust flying as he searched.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrash, there aren\u2019t any hand wheels like on our airlock doors, it looks like its all electronic.\u201d Rickles said, watching him.\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Kraskov said as he kept running his hands along the door, \u201cwhen you have a purely mechanical door, or at least one where the main function is mechanical, there is no need for a backup.  But when its main function is electronic, you always, ah!\u201d He said as his fingers dug into something in a pile of windblown dust near the bottom of the door, \u201cYou always have to have a backup.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a lever away from the edge of the door, which was hidden in the seam of the airlock.   It creaked and groaned as he pushed it down and flat against the ground.  The airlock squealed and moved forward half an inch.  \u201cSee?  Ol\u2019 Kraskov has some tricks up his sleeves.  Like common engineering knowledge any first year student would have.\u201d He tapped the side of his helmet with a grin, and Rickles just crossed her arms.  Wind buffeted them, and the sky was turning from hazy orange to almost black.\n\nHe pumped away at the lever and the door slowly continued to creak open.  When it was wide enough for their helmets to fit through, they all piled in.  With a few taps to their wrist computers, light shone out from the sides of their visors.  The inside of the airlock was plain and seemed to be standard issue, nothing out of the ordinary.  Kraskov repeated the procedure inside to close the door and it eventually completely closed with a thunk.\n\n\nThe silence pressed in around them as Kraskov squeezed past and to the opposite side of the airlock, he tapped at the console at that side for a few seconds.  \u201cNo dice,\u201d He said.\n\nJackson squeezed his hands open and closed, frustration and anger building up.  \u201cSo will we be able to get in?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d Kraskov said as he felt around the edge of the door.  \u201cWell, looks like there is another lever here, so we\u2019re about to find out if there is atmosphere in there or not.\u201d  He dug his fingers around the lever.\n\n\u201cHow will we kno-\u201c Rickles started before a massive blast of air pushed them all back as Kraskov pushed down on the lever. Had there been more space in the airlock, they would have all been slammed to the ground, or the opposite door, but luckily Jackson had already been pressed up against the far door and they all just got squeezed against each other.\n\n\u201cRight,\" Rickles said, correcting herself,  \"the airlock was \u2018full\u2019 of vacuum,\u201d  She lifted her wrist up to her visor and tapped at it a few times.  \u201cLooks like we\u2019ve got breathable atmo, boys.\u201d\n\nJackson sighed with relief and reached to turn the clasps of his helmet when Kraskov reached out a hand and stopped him.\n\n\u201cCommander, you don\u2019t think there are any like\u2026 Soviet superbugs floating in here, do you?\u201d  \n\nJackson just lifted his eyebrow at him. \n\n\u201cRight, right, nevermind.\u201d Kraskov said as he reached up to unclasp his own helmet.\n\nJackson popped the clasps and felt a rush a cool air enter his helmet, he slowly slid it off and took in a slow breath.  Other than a slight musty smell, and the smell of metal, the air was normal.  \u201cTastes a little dry,\u201d He said, smacking his lips.\n\nThe others filed suit.  \u201cWelp, might as well check out what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d Kraskov said as he pumped the lever again and the door squealed on its hinges.  With their helmets propped under their arms they all squeezed past the door and into an open room beyond.\n\nEven with the tiled glass making up the dome above them, the room was dark, and their helmet lights cast strange shadows around the walls.  Eventually their lights all focused on one thing in the center of the room.\n\n\u201cWell, shit.\u201d Jackson said.\n\nBalancing precariously in the center of the room, bouncing their lights around in odd ways, was a large, oddly geometrical and sharp angled metal egg.\n\n----\nLike most authors on here, I have my own subreddit: r/heyagoncho so if you'd like to check it out and read some of my other stories, or if you lose sight of this thread and want to keep reading this, it'll be updated there!\n",

                                            "comment": "\u201cUh, uh, nope!\u201d Rickles said, stepping back and away from the egg in the middle of the room. \n\nJackson nodded, \u201cI\u2019d have to agree with Lieutenant Rickles, last time we had the vacuum of space to deal with whatever was inside that egg.  This time, it\u2019s not so convenient.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even to practice my Russian, comrade?\u201d Kraskov asked.\n\n\u201cNot even for that,\u201d Rickles replied.\n\n\u201cGot it.\u201d Kraskov said, \u201cSo where to next?\u201d he held his helmet in both hands and pointed its lights towards the left of the room, at an open airlock.  \u201cThat way?  Through a creepy, dark airlock, or,\u201d He swiveled the helmet to an identical airlock door on the opposite side of the room, \u201cOr this way, through an eerie, dark airlock?\u201d\n\nJackson chewed on his lip for a moment, \u201cI guess we\u2019ll take eerie, dark airlock.  That way heads more towards the bulk of the domes.  Maybe we\u2019ll find a comm station, or some way to turn the lights on.\u201d\n\nThe other two murmured their assent and they carefully skirted their way around the egg, each keeping a wary eye on it, in case it decided to spontaneously start to crack open.  This airlock was open fully, and their boot steps rang against the metal floors, echoing throughout the empty domes.\n\nThe next dome wasn\u2019t encased in glass, and it was even darker than the previous one.  They shone their lights around and saw equipment lining the walls.  Rickles stepped closer and examined one more closely, \u201cLooks like manufacturing equipment,\u201d She said, \u201cFairly high tech, like something we\u2019d have in a factory down on Earth.\u201d \n\nJackson scanned the room with his lights, landing them on two airlocks that stood next to each other.  He stepped closer and saw that there was faded yellow paint in between the doors.  Russian lettering.\n\nKraskov saw this and approached, \u201cYeah, yeah.  I came as an engineer, not a translator, you know that right?\u201d\n\nHe brushed dust away from the lettering and read out loud, \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435,  \u043b\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c.\u201d He said, \u201cSleeping quarters and stuff that way.\u201d Tilting his head to the left, \u201cAnd\u2026 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, A control room, or administration this way.\u201d\n\nJackson nodded and Rickles returned from her examination of the equipment and they all moved through the airlock.  Another dome full of equipment greeted them in the next, Rickles said it was more of the same and Kraskov pointed them through another airlock.\n\nMoving into the next dome, they could tell it was different from the few they had just explored.  This was another glass encased dome, but no egg stood in its center.  A set of stairs led up to a raised platform, where squat computer consoles sat in a circle, office chairs strewn about between them.  Rickles hesitantly climbed the stairs, while Kraskov walked the \u2018aisle\u2019 between the glass and the raised platform.\n\nRickles rolled a chair towards the nearest console and sat gingerly.  She blew gently across the terminal, dislodging dust that had sat for who knows how long. Jackson rested a hand on the back of the office chair and watched her read over the console.\n\n\u201cIts all in Russian,\u201d She said, pouring over the keyboard and rest of the console, \u201cI know the basics, thank god for NASA\u2019s extensive and overly in depth training protocols.\u201d  She scanned the console and pressed a button.  Nothing happened.  \u201cWell, that\u2019s the power button, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d  \n\nJackson sighed, \u201cYeah, I figured power would be more of an issue than just pushing a button.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold your horses!\u201d Kraskov\u2019s muffled voice came from below them.\n\nJackson leaned out and over the row of consoles and saw Kraskov\u2019s boots sticking out from under the platform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting power readings through some of these cables,\u201d Kraskov explained, his voice strained as he fumbled around underneath the platform, \u201cI think they shut this all down manually.\u201d His feet flopped over, as he rolled over onto his back.\n\n\u201cThink you can get it back on?\u201d Jackson called out, still leaning over the rail.\n\n\u201cWorkin\u2019 on it.\u201d His muffled voice replied.  After a few more minutes of muted tinkering sounds, Kraskov finally shouted out, \u201cAlright, here we go!\u201d \n\nThere was a clunk, and then silence.  Jackson and Rickles looked around for a minute, nothing had changed.  All they could hear was slight creaks in the dome, and a light hiss from the glass panels. Sand was being pelted against the panels, much like rain, it fell sideways in wavering sheets.\n\n\u201cWell come on, damn it!\u201d They heard Kraskov\u2019s impatient voice break the silence, \u201cWork!\u201d They heard a clang and then a light hum filled the room.  Jackson leaned over the rail again and saw light spilling out from the hatchway Kraskov had crawled into.  The large man shimmied his way out. Jackson could see dust covering him from the waist up.\n\n\u201cNothing a little elbow grease couldn\u2019t solve,\u201d He said, standing and brushing orange dust from out of his hair.  He stretched and then made his way around to the stairs and joined Jackson and Rickles on the platform. \n\nThey stood behind Rickles\u2019 chair and she held her breath as she pressed the power button once again.  The console clicked and whirred for a few moments.  \n\nKraskov scratched his head, puzzled, sending dust flittering down his chest, \u201cI\u2019m no scientist, but isn\u2019t there supposed to be a screen?\u201d  He asked, indicating to the console, which was all buttons and dials.\n\nIn answer, the glass panels of the dome turned opaque, sending the room into darkness, the only light spilling out from under the platform and from their helmets.  Slowly, the panels changed from black, to dark red.  Rickles turned and looked at the two men behind her, bathed in red light, she shivered slightly and then returned her attention to the screen.  A yellow hammer and sickle faded into existence in the middle of the dome.  \n\n\nRickles pushed a button and the screen faded away only to be replaced by a lighthearted family photo.  It showed a man and a wife, with two little girls crowded in around their knees, smiling for a photo op in front of a dome of glass, which showed hazy orange mountains behind them.  \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jackson said, \u201cI did not expect to be greeted by that.\u201d\n\nRickles scanned the console and then pointed to a card that was jutting out of a slot.  \u201cWell, it looks like,\u201d she peered closer \u201cSenior Lieutenant Kurdin forgot to take his ID badge with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThankfully they're just as bad at CompSec as the rest of us,\u201d Kraskov chuckled.\n\nRickles moved the cursor to what she figured was the file directory and clicked on it.  Hundreds of Russian labeled folders sprang into view, and she scrolled slowly through them. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to need your help translating, Crash,\u201d Rickles said, \u201cso we can figure out what the hell is going on around here.\u201d\n\n Kraskov leaned over her shoulder and they began reading through the files.\n\n----\nLike most authors on here, I have my own subreddit: r/heyagoncho so if you'd like to check it out and read some of my other stories, or if you lose sight of this thread and want to keep reading this, it'll be updated there!\n",

This is crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Rickles said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just that.  We\u2019ve corroborated what we read on that \u2018egg\u2019, or as they refer to it, a stasis pod.\u201d She took a breath and continued, \u201cAnd we found a section in the files that chronicles most of their accomplishments over the years.  Here, let me show you.\u201d\n\nShe turned back to the computer and opened a folder.  \u201cThis one,\u201d She said, opening another, \u201cshows pictures of their first manned mission to Mars.\u201d  The picture she opened showed a group of cosmonauts surrounding a small red flag, planted in the Martian soil. One of the cosmonauts was holding out his hand in a V shape towards the camera.   A hardcoded date sat in the corner, it read: October 26th, 2059.\n\nAnother photo opened, taken what looked like the same spot on the ridge they had climbed earlier.  People in spacesuits milling between shiny domes, some waving towards the camera, most going out their normal routines.  Off in the distance, a huge spaceship lay on its side, having been partially deconstructed, probably used to build most of the colony.\n\n\u201cPermanent,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nKraskov nodded.\n\nJackson whistled low.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Kraskov interjected, \u201cI don\u2019t think we just somehow transported in time.  But\u2026\u201d He blinked his eyes and looked away like he didn\u2019t want to say it, \u201cWe somehow moved to another\u2026 Timeline?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother timeline?\u201d Jackson scoffed.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s crazy, but there is stuff in here that just didn\u2019t happen in our line of events.\u201d Rickles continued, \u201cLook,\u201d She said, opening another set of folders, \u201cHere, it says that the USSR repels the initial invasion of Germany into Ukraine.  Which I know for a fact didn\u2019t happen.  Then systematically, while Germany is occupied with the Allies, invade Germany and end the war in Europe two years earlier than it should have happened.  That same year, they detonate the first atomic bomb.  Two years before America\u2019s even started testing nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nShe flipped through photos and newspaper clippings, showing victory after victory of the USSR.  \u201cNot only that, but they become a major superpower, even bigger than they were during the cold war.    They continue Germany\u2019s land war, eventually annexing most of Europe, using their \u2018advanced weaponry and indomitable Soviet spirit.\u2019 Gorbachev doesn\u2019t even get mentioned, never having been a part of the Soviets.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Jackson muttered, his eyes closed, trying to come to grips with this information, \u201cSo basically, everything changed after around 1942?  No bombs on Hiroshima, no Cold War?\u201d\n\nKraskov shook his head, \u201cThe Cold War wasn\u2019t so cold.\u201d\n\nRickles continued, \u201cAfter World War 2, Russia started gobbling up as much land as possible.  America tried to step in, but was rebuked. After another twenty years or so, it turned into a bloodbath.  The states and the USSR entered into a stalemate of a war, lasting decades, truces were made and broken, periods of peace reigned supreme before being squashed down in another war.  And then\u2026\u201d  She said clicking on a video this time, \u201cThis happened.\u201d\n\nThe video opened with a shot of the Earth, the camera mounted on a satellite, North America is plainly seen through a haze of light clouds.  Without warning, the camera shakes violently, and a plume of rocket gas and flames erupts from a missile, having just been launched.  It careens toward earth, banking into Earth\u2019s rotation, intent on its destination.  Hundreds of other streaks of similar missiles enter the frame, having apparently been launched by other satellites. \n\nAs the missiles are lost out of sight of within Earth\u2019s atmosphere, small eruptions of white smoke are seen launching from America, large plumes emanating from interior areas of the country.  A retaliatory strike, they zip around and are soon lost in Earth\u2019s horizon. \n\nExplosions are seen dotting America\u2019s shorelines, where population densities are highest, others strike directly where missiles had launched just minutes before.\n\nHuge mushroom clouds begin forming, pushing the hazy clouds away in large swaths where each explosion took place.\n\nJackson covered his mouth, as flashes of light played across his face.  \u201cGood lord, it\u2019s like Judgement Day.\u201d\n\nKraskov gave him a sly look, \u201cCommander Connor, I never took you for a classic movie buff.\u201d\n\nRickles shot him a look, \u201cThis is serious, Crash.\u201d\n\nHe held up both hands, pleading guilty, \u201cI know, I know. But you have to remember, yeah this actually happened.  But it DIDN\u2019T happen to us.  To our \u2018timeline\u2019.\u201d\n\nJackson tore his eyes away from the screen, blinking away emotions.  He gritted his teeth together, \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d He said, sitting up straight in his chair, \u201cThis is all well and good that we know what happened, and now not only do we know where we are, but now we know WHEN we are.\u201d \n\nHe stood up in his chair, \u201cThat\u2019s enough with the history lessons, we need to get to work.  If whatever tech they have in here can bring us here, it sure as hell can bring us back.\u201d\n\nKraskov and Rickles stood up with him.  \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d Kraskov said, \u201cLet\u2019s find whatever damn time machine they have lying around and make it take us home.\u201d\n\nRickles nodded and lead the way. They all started down the stairs, fierce and determined looks on their faces.\n\nHalfway down the stairs, the sound of glass shattering against the floor echoed through the nearest airlock.\n\nThey all froze mid-step.\n",

Kraskov lifted a finger, noting the presence of light footsteps slapping against the floor.  They passed by and then faded away.  Jackson made a hand signal, and the other two nodded in agreement.  Each astronaut slowly filed through the airlock, stepping gently so that their heavy boots didn\u2019t give them away.\n\nThey attempted to stealthily make their way across the manufacturing dome, but the space suits were never designed to be tiptoed in. They gave each other glares as inevitably they scuffed the floor or caught a toe on the rough metal.  Soon they were across the dome, and once again they hunched in a group around the next airlock.\n\n\u201cDormitories,\u201d Kraskov whispered, motioning up at the faded yellow writing.  They all crouched silently.  Sounds emanated through the airlock.  They could hear scuffling noises and things being knocked around, apparently whoever was in there wasn\u2019t trying to be as stealthy as they were.\n\nA sound of a zipper running up its length filled the air, and then was followed by the snaps of metal buttons being closed.  Silence hung in the air for a few moments, before footsteps, booted now, began stomping towards them.\n\nJackson looked around quickly, eyeing any nearby hiding spots, when a man\u2019s voice called out from within the airlock.  Russian filled their ears, and Kraskov chewed on his lip.  \u201cKnows we\u2019re here,\u201d he said, any pretense of whisper gone from his voice.\n\nThey stood and slowly backed away from the airlock, and a man slowly emerged from the darkness.  He was middle aged, streaks of grey dashed across his temples.  He wore a brown jumpsuit, sickle and hammer emblazoned across its chest in gold thread.  He grinned at them, his eyes flashing in pleasure in the low light of the dome.\n\n\u201cAh, comrades!\u201d He exclaimed, opening his arms wide and then continuing on in Russian.  Rickles slowly peered over at Kraskov.  \n\nKraskov had a strange look on his face, mouth slightly opened and his eyebrow raised in confusion.\n\nThe man continued to speak as he walked towards them, the pitch of his voice joyful and words spilling out of his mouth.  He was obviously happy to see them.\n\nKraskov opened his mouth further to speak, when the man suddenly stopped dead in his tracks, his eyes narrowing in suspicion. \n\n\u201cAh, there we go.\u201d Kraskov muttered.\n\nThe man\u2019s eyes swept across their space suits, stopping purposefully on each flag velcroed on their shoulders.\n\n\u201cAmericans.\u201d He spat through heavily accented Russian.\n\nKraskov said something in Russian, his hands outstretched, palms down in a calming, placating gesture.  The man responded by reaching down his left hand and resting it on the grip of a pistol which hung off his hip.\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d He said, backing away from the airlock and motioning with his free hand. \n\nNobody moved, Rickles looked back and forth between her two crewmates.\n\n\u201cNow.\u201d the Russian said in a much harsher tone.\n\nJackson sighed and walked forward, keeping his hands slightly raised.  Rickles and Kraskov followed suit.  The Russian stalked behind them, guiding them through the airlock.  They passed by bunks, standard issue military with footlockers at each end.  Tan lockers lined the walls, one was open, clothes and personal effects strewn about inside it.\n\nThe Russian beckoned them forward and they passed through another airlock into a cafeteria of some sort.  Tables and benches were neatly arranged in a circular pattern, a small serving line and kitchen area was nestled away on the opposite side of the small dome.\n\nHe motioned towards a table near the far wall, \u201cTam,\u201d he barked. The trio uneasily made their way over and stood nervously by the table.  \u201cSuits,\u201d The Russian man said, \u201cOff.\u201d\n\nRickles put her hands on her hips and stared crossly at the man.\n\nHe rolled his eyes and waved away her look, \u201cI don\u2019t care to see you naked,\u201d he said in his heavy accent, \u201cI don\u2019t trust what you \u2018ave in those suits.  Plus,\u201d He continued peering at their necks, \u201cI can tell you have jumpsuits underneath.\u201d\n\nRickles sighed and obliged to his orders.  While they undressed, the Russian man made his way over to the far wall and retrieved a tablet from its holder.  He tapped away at it while they removed their suits and the room buzzed to life.  Overhead lights glowed softly, set high above in the metal roof of the dome.  Soon their suits were piled against a wall, far out of reach of their table.  They stood awkwardly in their white and grey jumpsuits.  He eyed them carefully for any signs of a weapon, satisfied, he approached them, tablet in hand.\n\n\u201cSit,\u201d the man said, beckoning them to the table with the tablet.  They did as they were told, only having to squeeze slightly to all fit on the bench.  He pulled the bench on his side out slightly with his foot, straddled it and then sat down.\n\nHe fiddled with the tablet for a few minutes, glancing up at them occasionally.  \u201cBlyat,\u201d he muttered under his breath, his eyes widening and then shaking his head.\n\nHe tossed the tablet onto the table as if he were disgusted by it. It skidded across the table and Jackson had to catch it to keep it from falling off.  The Russian eyed them suspiciously and then placed the gun on the table pointing towards them, his hand resting lightly on it.  Jackson fidgeted nervously, glancing down between the gun and the man, tablet forgotten underneath his hand.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d the Russian said, taking a deep breath and steeling himself, he tapped nervously on the gun and then continued, \u201cAre you ready to hear the terms of my surrender?\u201d\n",

            "comment": "The strata of rocks rose above Luke's head. Red and copper, with silver glinting through the dust. His own breathing was the only thing he could hear, the burst of static from the radio dimming into the distance as he looked at the flag. A wire ran through it, keeping it upright. Due to the exposure, it had been bleached almost white, but it was still unmistakeable. The pale shape of a hammer and sickle on a background that had once been bright red. \n\n\n\nLuke moistened his lips and reached out to touch it. A Soviet flag, and he was too young to have seen the Space Race of the 60s, but this would have been shouted from the mountains. Where were the bases? Even in the dying days of the Cold War it had never been mentioned. Luke scanned the landscape, wondering if he would see some clues as to why the flag stood there, but there was nothing. The sand lay in settled ridges around it. Dust, as far as Luke could see. \n\n\n\n*This shouldn't be here.* \n\n\n\n\nIn the box he carried, the rocks were beginning to weigh him down. Samples, for the small team in the Rover. Him, Tori the All-American girl, and Parker, the foul-mouthed Australian who was bitter about working with Americans. Already he was past the time he'd expected to be out for. Massive over-provision of supplies allowed for delays, but he couldn't stay out here indefinitely. \n\n\n\n\"Base,\" Luke spoke quickly and quietly into the Snoopy Cap. \"This is Greenman, I've come across something weird. Taking photos now.\" \n\n\n\nHe raised the camera and pressed the button, allowing a stream of images to be taken and sent instantly back to the Rover. He imagined Parker swearing under his breath at having to come and join Tori at the screens, checking the display, the flag stood square against the drab landscape. His throat was surprisingly dry. Luke coughed. Spit wouldn't form in his mouth. \n\n\n\nIn his ear, Tori replied. Her voice had a twinge in it that Luke didn't recognise. The usually chirpy voice was gone: underlaid was a current of fear. \n\n\n\n\"Greenman, this is Woods,\" she started. \"Is something affecting your connection? We're only hearing gibberish.\" \n\n\n\n\"This is Greenman, what do you mean, gibberish?\" \n\n\n\n\"You're not making any sense,\" Tori's voice rose to a crescendo. \"Are you okay? The photos--\" \n\n\n\nShe'd abandoned protocol. Luke frowned. His lips were chapped. When he moved, the dryness split and blood began to run over his chin. He extended his tongue, but the droplet ran faster and he could no longer reach it. \n\n\n\n\"Damnit,\" he growled. With gloves and the cask, he'd have to wait until he returned to clean his face. The flag stood resolutely still. In his ear, white noise whispered. He sniffed, feeling blood begin to leak out of one nostril. Frustrated, Luke turned and headed for the Rover, still feeling some elation at bounding across the rocky ground. Day on Mars, the sky was a pale blue, greyer than on Earth. The blood from his nose became a torrent, leaking and dripping over his lips. He could taste the iron of it, and tears leaked from his eyes. \n\n\n\n\nThe Rover stood stoically flat over the next series of mounds. Orange dust swept up to it, covering every inch of its bulky frame. The thick windows glinted silver. \n\n\n\n\"This is Greenman,\" he said as he approached. The rocks seemed to be becoming heavier. Pressing him into the ground. Luke ran a hand under the strap of the box. It was then he noticed the blood on his hands as well, leaking through the gloves. It stemmed from around his fingernails, though he felt no pain. \n\n\n\nThere was no answer from the Rover. \n\n\n\n\"This is Greenman,\" he said again. \n\n\n\n\"We can't open,\" Tori's frightened voice came back. \"We see you outside Luke, we can't let you in.\" \n\n\nSomething broke and fell in Luke's mouth. He spat it out; a rush of blood and saliva. A tooth sat against the screen of his cask, down to the root. Some of the gum had come out, too, and it glistened in front of him. Terror twisted within him. \n\n\n\n\"They're in the air, Luke,\" Tori said again. \"They're in the air, we can see them in the photos, and now they're inside you.\" \n\n\nThe liquid that trickled from his eyes wasn't tears. Luke's heart began to pound, fear eating in his belly. \n\n\n\n\"Look at the photos,\" Tori said. \"Oh god, look at the photos.\" \n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n/r/Schoolgirlerror for more stories, though this is one of my first attempts at science fiction.

            "comment": "When I was told my team would be the first to land on Mars, excitement welled within me. 'Pioneers', they called us; and really, how many people can call themselves pioneers? It's exciting. It's scary. It's... unlike anything else.\n\n\nAnd yet, as I stood and looked across an expanse of nothing but reddish brown sand and dust, I felt absolutely nothing but disappointment. The voyage was hell, and I'd spent *so long* looking forward to landing that the reality of Mars just couldn't live up to what I'd been expecting. The first three days were mind-numbingly boring and dreary.\n\n\nThe fourth day changed everything.\n\n\n\"What... the *hell* is that?\" I asked through the comm system, pointing at a torn-up tent in the distance. \"Did one of you assholes set that up to screw with me?\"\n\n\n\"I wish I were that creative, believe me,\" Stan responded, staring alongside me. \"But that... that's not us. There's a flag, Mike. I can't make it out from here.\"\n\n\nThe two of us, along with Victor Foreman, our engineer, pressed forward with caution. As we approached, the flag became increasingly visible: plain red, with a yellow hammer and sickle. It was tattered and coated in dust.\n\n\n\"Okay, this is bullshit. O'Neill, are you fucking with us? I remember seeing this flag in history class.\"\n\n\nA response came over the radio. \"This is a bit too... complex for my sense of humor. I'm a simple man, Mike. I don't recognize the flag, what is it?\"\n\n\n\"Come on, man. Sleep through class?\"\n\n\n\"Sorry, I was busy learning how to pilot for NASA. This isn't funny, Mike. If you've seriously found something, we have to treat this situation with urgency and caution.\"\n\n\nI sighed into the mic. \"Soviet Russia. The one we got into the Cold War with, way back when.\"\n\n\n\"I'm going to contact HQ. Proceed as if there could be people in that base.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, come on, Cap-\"\n\n\n\"I know we get cozy, but right now, we're not friends.\"\n\n\nI choked back my pride. \"Understood. Stay by the feeds, we're heading in. I'm telling you, though, there's no one here anymore. Everything's... just- it's destroyed. Ripped to shreds.\"\n\n\nI stepped forward, pushing aside a fold of fabric from the tent wall. Immediately, I recoiled, sucking my breath in. Right there, on a cafeteria bench, was a man- his skin pale, spotted with black and brown, but nearly perfectly mummified overall. He looked like he'd died just a week prior.\n\n\n\"Holy shit.\" Victor threw up in his suit, then tried to paw at his slimy helmet.\n\n\n\"Cap, I don't think this is a joke. You see this, right?\"\n\n\n\"Already contacting Houston. Someone's going to have to reach out and see if there's something we don't know about. Does he look injured?\"\n\n\nI kept myself at a distance, scanning his body with my eyes. There were still packets of food on a nearby counter. \"No. Honestly, it looks like he just suffocated. He didn't starve, and there's no blood or any kind of wound.\"\n\n\nThere was a large, clunky device on the table in front of the body. I reached out and grabbed it, keeping my eyes off the corpse.\n\n\n\"I think it's a recording device.\" There were batteries in it, still looking fresh. Oxygen's a real asshole when it comes to preservation.\u00a0\n\n\nI flipped a window out on the lefthand side, and turned it on. After rewinding for several seconds, a man appeared on screen- I immediately recognized him. I slipped my suit's 3.5mm jack into the recording device once it finished rewinding.\n\n\n\"Hello,\" he said with a thick, Russian accent. \"I have made many videos in Russian, but I have a feeling it won't matter. This last one will be in English.\n\n\n\"Russia has abandoned me. I was sent here as an experiment for the government, to see if we could set up a base, maybe build in secrecy. The journey was too harsh, and the travel time too long. I burned more fuel than we thought, and now I am stuck here. They told me that nobody will be coming to save me.\u00a0\n\n\nThe man's breath grew shaky, and he wiped at his eyes.\n\n\n\"I asked to speak with my family. They said no. They said nobody will ever know of my time here. My death will be faked in an accident upon re-entry of Earth's atmosphere. Parachute failure.

I die for nothing.\n\n\n\"I do not expect to be saved. Maybe nobody finds this. I don't know why I film. If you do, please tell my daughter I love her. Maybe my wife if she's still alive.

            "comment": "\"... and so it is that we find ourselves in the position to be able to introduce Polkovnik Vladimir Komorov to the platform. Please wait until his statement is finished before asking any questions.\"\n\nThe NASA press secretary took a step down, and shook the gentleman's hand. The cameras flashed without cease, making it difficult to keep his eyes open to see where he was going.  He reached out his hand to feel the podium and stepped up.\n\n\"Thank you for your time today.  Before going any further I would like to first speak to my beloved daughter Irina. I know you had to grieve for me. I know you had to grow up without a father. I know that the times you have seen have challenged you, and I know you must have much anger towards me.\"\n\nHe paused, not solely for breath, but for strength. \n\n\"I was often there. I came to see my beloved Valentina, your mother, buried and I saw you. I was scared and excited that you might have seen me but you could barely see past your tears. I wanted so surely to come and hold you and explain everything I could, but it was impossible. I hope you can learn to forgive me for all that I did, and us, for all that we had done.  I hope you can look at what we planned to do and find a way to understand it.  I am sorry, my daughter.\"\n\nA tear rolled down his cheek, which he wiped away with his hand, as youthful as it ever was. He took a sip of water, and mopped his brow. Coughing, he took a deep breath and composed himself.\n\n\u201cYou must understand how difficult this is for us, we glorify all our successes and work very hard at keeping our failures hidden.  This was not a failure.  This was glory.  We had beaten our biggest adversary at the biggest race there had ever been.\u201d\n\nThe excitement in his voice was clear, and this excitement was harmonised by the cameras flashing, catching each gesture and each strong look to be uploaded immediately to social media channels, published on blogs, and shown news outlets alike.\n\n\u201cWe had a plan, of course, we had everything on hand, and we had prepared everything to broadcast live from the Red Planet the very day that America was to land on the moon. Can you imagine?! Glorious communism beating this ridiculous idea of democracy, this capitalist society where only the rich survive and the poor are left in squalor, you americans are so arrogant and we would show you, we would be the ones to lead the world into the new era.  Yuri kep-\u201d\n\nHe paused to cough. Around the room, hundreds of people held their breath. Vlad noticed that his heart was beating so fast, he believed it might pump straight through his chest.  \n\n\u201cYuri kept saying we were like Columbus but I always corrected him. We weren\u2019t like Columbus, he only found land that humans already conquered. We we-\u201c\n\nVlad brought his hand to his mouth to cough.  He noticed a spat of blood on his hand.\n\n\u201cWe were truly the first from the human race to reach this land.  So we set off on April 24th, 1967, and the mission went without problem.  We exited earths orbit the next day, using earths gravity to push us as fast as we could towards our destination.  All of this went without incident, which, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve now noticed, is where our story deviates from yours.\u201d\n\nAs the lights beat down on his head, he squinted to the back of the room, thinking he had seen an old face.\n\n\u201cWe settled down to the long journey.  We had large elastic bands for resistance training to keep our muscle mass up, and we had just simple concentrated rations to get us through the year. The landing sequence went well, but touchdown was harsh, I broke my collar bone and Yuri had some manner of nerve damage that made his hands shake.  Of course, everythin-\u201d\n\nHe paused again, mouth suddenly dry.  As he looked across the room, he realised he could see no faces, his vision was blurred. He wiped his brow again, and paused to take a sip of the water.\n\nHe sipped, but this time noticed the numbers 14-07-54 etched into the base of the glass.  His thumping heartbeat practically stopped as he looked up and around.\n\nHe looked to the back of the room and saw her.  He knew he didn\u2019t have much time.\n\n\u201cEverything went to plan.  Right up until November 7th 1968.  When we awoke that day, Yuri was out of bed, and looked YOUNGER.  He was repairing some electronics for the air recycling system that I had been working on, because his hands wouldn\u2019t stop shaking.  When I went to wash my face, I noticed all my grey hair had gone. My wrinkles had gone. The ache in my collarbone had gone. I could stretch my arm to full reach without problem.  You can imagine how we felt, somehow we had found the effects of Bimini, and the pool of which Herodotus wrote. We were excited to share this news with RSVN, with Kosygin, and with all of Russia, but that day was w-\u201c\n\nA thud. A flash. Vlad reached to his chest but could not feel his heart.  He dropped to the ground.  He didn\u2019t hear the screams and didn\u2019t see the camera flashes.  He only saw Irina, and reached out his hand to hold hers.\n\n\u201cIt has to be this way, father\u201d she said softly, as he drifted into eternal darkness.",

Short draft, criticism most welcome :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI could not believe what I was looking at. It was hard to make out amidst the crimson Martian backdrop but there was no doubting it: there it was, the red flag of a forgotten behemoth fluttering in the heavy wind.\n\nI drove towards the flag and saw a cornucopia of alien-looking metallic parts strewn about. It was too cold here, at the 'north' pole of Mars, to remove my pressurized suit but I could swear I felt a cold breeze spiraling up my spine. We had chosen the north pole because countless computer simulations had shown this to be the only viable landing spot given the planet's tumultuous climate. And yet, somehow, the Soviets had figured it all out before the invention of the microprocessor! Still perplexed, I climbed out of the rover and started walking towards the flag - One small  step for man, one giant *fall* for mankind.\n\nI immediately heard a loud beep and a projector beamed light from somewhere amongst the rubble onto the swaying flag. It was the image of a cosmonaut, his features barely visible beneath the visor. \"So, you have finally caught up.\", he spoke with a heavy accent. \"But your joy is unfortunately short-lived. You see, what you fail to realize is this simple fact: A trap is far more useful than a petty boast. You are here and that could only mean that we have failed, our leaders have failed and our fatherland is no more. We have lost but we will not lose alone. Vengeance will be our farewell for what good can come from a world without the USSR? The USSR is no more thus, no longer shall there be a world. You see, \", I could now see a pearly white arc beneath that visor, \"the Soviet nuclear launch codes were not just in the hands of our great leader, they were also here; here, beneath your very feet. We thank you, dear enemy, we can only thank you.\"\n\nAnd that is how I fulfilled their prophecy; that, is how I became the very last scream of humanity.",

The brave crew of Salyut 1 will be remembered as a sober reminder of outer space's unforgiving nature.  May their souls rest in peace. This is Dan Rather, reporting from Moscow.\"  The party leader gestured and the secretary shut off the imported American television.  It was a frustrating state, relying on a capitalist-built device deep within the halls of Soviet power, but he knew it was just a matter of time before the situation reversed.  The dialectic demanded it, after all.\n\n\"There\", he told the waiting group, \"there have been no reports from the field of anything but acceptance of the story.  The Americans have accepted the narrative provided, it's time to move to the next stage.\"  The other party members in the room avoided looking to one another, all nodded in affirmation.  The greatest endeavor was to begin in secrecy, but the triumph would soon be on every radio speaker and television screen around the world, no matter which country produced it.  The moon landings had been a great achievement, but soon everyone would see the power of true collective power.\n\nThe leader smiled.  \"Begin the launches.\"\n\n---\n\nSOMEWHERE OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN \nSeptember 28 1971\n\nGeorgy Dobrovolsky sat aboard the auxillary guidance device.  With luck, he'd not need it, but the 'unforgiving nature' of space was real, even if the American reporter had been mistaken about the fatalities about which he'd reported.  Checking his scope, Georgy checked the approaching propulsion module.  \n\n\"25 meters\", he called out.  \"Nominal approach continues.\"  Viktor floated next to him, strapped into the seat on the wall of the former space station.  He nodded, watching the monitor in front of him. \n \n\"Da, ground control has reported the same.  Continue to checklist item...  25a.  Terminal radio beacon activate.\"  The two looked up at the panel next to the guidance frame Georgy sat on.  It looked more like a bicycle than anything else, but no cyclist had ever travelled this fast.  A light on the panel illuminated.  \"Terminal guidance beacon has activated\", he pronounced.  After a few minutes, there was a slight jarring sound as the oversized propulsion module slid into place.  \n\n\"Contact, positive latching...  confirmed.  Docking sequence complete.\"  The two unstrapped from their stations and took turns looking backwards through the periscope.  Behind them, a series of large tanks stretched backwards from the aft docking port. \n\nVladislav Volkov floated over from the kitchen.  \"Do ve have a spaceship?\"  he asked.\n\nThe three looked at each other, faces beaming.  Dobrovolsky was the first to speak.\n\n\"Comrades, it is with great pleasure that I announce the retirement of Salyut 1 and welcome you both...   to the Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.  May Mars's red light fill our windows and help spread the light of Soviet greatness.\"  \n\n\"To Mars!\" the other two cheered.  \n\n---\n\nWASHINGTON, DC\nOctober 1, 1971\n\n\"Mister President, what are your orders?\"\n\nPresident Nixon stared at the diagram on the briefing room wall quietly.  The damn reds had skunked him, and good.  \n\n\"Sir\", the National Security Advisor murmured in his deep germanic accent, \"if we interfere, it could be seen as an act of war.\"  The other military representative at the other side shook his head fiercely. \n \n\"Goddamnit, they're tearing us apart in Asia, now you want to sit back and let them take a WHOLE PLANET?\"  He slammed his fist on the table.  \"Sir, if we launch now, we can make it look like an accident.  Hell, as far as the rest of the world knows, those cosmonauts died months ago.  The red's'll have no way to accuse us of anything without letting the world know they lied.  We've got a Titan II on the pad and ready to go, we can put a cloud of ball bearings on an intercept course before you can say 'borscht's done'.  Just give me the word!\"  \n\nThe president sat, thinking.  This was a turning point, he could feel it.  If he acted, he might save the US from losing face, but at what cost?  Then again, things with China were starting to cool a little.  Could he jeopardize any of that?  No, the country needed a firm hand to guide it now more than ever, and he knew that provoking the bear would be a distraction.\n\n\"Don't do anything, stand down General.  Maybe the horse will learn to sing, but no provocation.  Do you understand me?\"  He glowered at the man, his jowls shaking slightly.  \n\n\"Yes, sir.\"  The general sat back.  There'd be more opportunities to fix this, but he could tell now wasn't the time or place.\n\n---\n\nINDIAN OCEAN\nOctober 2, 1971\n\nThe tracking ship rocked slightly out at sea.  Chelomei watched the sky, smoking his cigarette.  The radar dishes and antennas moved as one, tracking the tiny dot he saw coming over the horizon.  It was time.\n\nThrowing the half-smoked thing over the rail, he peered at the dot intently.  Behind him, he knew the radio and radar operators were watching their screens closely but he wanted to see it with his own eyes and-  there, it had begun.\n\nThe tiny dot brightened slightly.  He knew that the experimental Block D in back was now gulping fuel through the intricate plumbing of the fuel tanks installed over the previous months.\n\nKosmos 419, Mars 2, Mars 3, Luna 18....  secretly launching the heavy tanks to the station had been almost impossible with all the eyes around the world, but the Soviet discretion had somehow pulled it off.  Mars probes that existed only on paper, a robotic moon lander, a lunar observation satellite....  five Proton launches in a row to assemble the great voyage above everyone's head.  His rocket had met the task and exceeded all expecations.  He knew many scientists would be disappointed when their payload return mission failed or their Martian probe returned faked data, but he knew they would forgive all when they learned the truth.  The landers, of course, must be said to have failed.  A shame, but soon men would arrive.\n\nThe truth was, there was only one way to send the brave cosmonauts to Mars, and that was to assemble their long-duration ship on orbit.\n\nAs he mused, the dot passed overhead, the Block D burning through the kerosene and liquid oxygen steadily. He liked to imagine he could see it already going faster, but he knew that was probably his imagination.  \n\nHearing a cheer inside, he stood and finally looked away from the dot as it disappeared over the horizon.  He did not need to ask, he knew from the sound that the burn had been good.  In six months, the world would know of their hard work and the next stage of work could begin in earnest.  \n\n--- \n\nVANDENBERG AFB\nFebruary 16, 1972\n\nThe General walked out of the control room.  The Northern California hills were quiet, they always were after a launch.  The Titan III that had just roared upwards had seen to that, the animals were hiding.\n\nHe knew that if word got out of what his team had done, it would mean the end of his career at best but damnit, he couldn't just let the reds get to Mars.  Those boys in Asia had gone through too much under commie guns and planes to just let something like this pass.  \n\nHis staff would report that the satellite had failed to reach it's intended orbit.  The high energy upper stage requisitioned for the high-altitude Molniya orbit was more than enough to send the Special Package on its way, seeing as how much lighter it was.  A stern chase was a long chase, but the boys in trajectory were confident it'd go where it was needed.\n\nWhistling to himself, the general walked out to the staff car waiting.  If any of the guards thought it was strange that he looked so happy after a launch failure far above, they kept it to themselves.\n\n(Continued)",

                    "comment": "(continued from parent)\n\nALMOST TO MARS\nApril 24th, 1972\n\nThe small spacecraft wasn't much more than a solar panel, radar, and a simple payload.  For almost three months, it had sailed through space after the Centaur upper stage had dropped it.  An hour earlier, the timer had gone off and it had begun to periodically pulse.  Soon, it had a return signal.  The machine wasn't smart enough to make complicated decisions, but the simple circuits that ran it didn't need to know much.  The important decisions had, after all, been made months earlier in small offices and laboratories deep within the United States Air Force.  When the signal threshold reached the indicated point, a relay closed.  Power pulsed from the battery through a detonator which, in turn, activated the several kilograms of C4.  The spacecraft transformed into a cloud of expanding debris, chunks of tungsten mixed with sand that raced outwards in a forward cone.  Seconds after that, the cone reached it's mark.\n\n----\n\nThe first indication any of them had was a loud bang.  Then the alarms started.  \n\nGeorgy struggled to wake up, then his ears popped and adrenaline flashed through his system.  Pulling himself free of the sleeping sack, he shouted to the other two.\n\n\"Report!\"  \n\nVladislov and Viktor both stared at the gauges and pressed switches.  Half the lights were flashing red, many others were ominously dark.  Patsayev turned to him first.  \"We're losing pressure.\"\n\nDobrovolsky snorted, pointing to his ears.  \"I figured that out.  Where?\"  Vlad was already grabbing an implement from the kit attached to the wall.  Pressing a button, the battery-powered coil heated the end of the stick just enough to make it start smoking.  The smoke darted immediately forward towards....  the Zond.  \n\n\"Oh no\", he muttered.  The three floated to the doorway leading to their return capsule.  Vlad pushed in, the patch kit in hand.  A faint squeal was now audible and the two went back to securing the remainder of the systems and taking note of the damage while their crewmate worked to stop the leak.  \n\nAn hour later, the three convened around the small communal table bolted to the wall.\n\n\"It is bad?\" asked Viktor.\n\n\"It is...  not good\", agreed Viktor Patsayev.\n\nGeorgy stared at the gauges.  The fuel pods that had sent them Marswards were mostly empty already, of course, but even the fuel necessary to correct their triumphant free return trajectory was now insufficient.  Small traces of it and oxidizer remained, but not enough.  \n\n\"There is\", he said carefully, \"a problem with the fuel situation.\"  He bit his lip.  \"It is possible we might..  jettison much mass, possibly even move into the Zond and have enough impulse to enter the return orbit but...\"  he shook his head, \"it would be...  difficult.\"  Several months sitting still in a space the size of a Lada or Zil.  \n\nVladislov shook his head.  \"The Zond has been compromised as well.  Even if we could return, I do not believe the shield would allow us to safely re-enter.\"  \nViktor barked laughter at this.  The other two looked at him curiously.\n\n\"We would die\", he exclaimed, \"during re-entry?\"  They looked at him blankly for another moment, then Vlad nodded.  Georgy worked his way to the conclusion as well.  \n\n\"Ah\", he finally said, \"we would die on re-entry again, you might say.\" \n\n\"Fitting!\" laughed Viktor again.  The others finally chuckled.  \n\n\"It is a shame the antennas were also destroyed in the event\", Vlad added.  The laughing slowed, then stopped.  They had no means to report on what had happened.  The looming red planet in the window stared coldly in.\n\t\n----\n\nMOSCOW\nApril 30th, 1972\n\n\"Have we heard from them yet?\"  The party leader knew it was futile, someone would have told him, after all.  \n\nThe others in the room shook their heads sadly.  \n\n\"Do we know what happened, at least?\"\n\n\"We suspect the Americans, but...\" the man paused, thinking, then looked up.  \"But we cannot prove it.  There was a launch failure earlier this year, but the trajectory information we collected before losing line of sight was unusual.  It is\" he shrugged, \"it is only a theory.\"\n\n\"Continue to listen.  Our brothers may yet surprise us.\"  The others nodded and filed out of the room.  \n\nThe party leader sighed.  He thought back to the handsome American reporter's words from months earlier.  Space was most unforgiving indeed.  They might never know the circumstances behind the disaster, but it was undeniable that one had occurred.  He had no doubt there would be no transmissions.\n\nHe reached up to the ever-present file on the secret expedition and closed the cover.  No, there would be no accusations or reciminations.  It would, perhaps, be best to simply allow sleeping dogs to lie.  \n\n---- \n\nMARS\nMay 1st, 1972\n\n\"This is not the May Day celebration I anticipated\", Georgy Dobrovolsky quipped as he tugged the straps tight.  \n\nViktor Patsayev and Vladislav Volkov nodded in agreement, their suits hiding much of the motion.  \n\nThe fuel reserves had been depleted to make the small changes, but they had succeeded.  The rocket equation named after their ships namesake had functioned as expected, as had the laws of Newton and Chelomai.  The last of the fuel had had been expended and the ships course was now set upon mathematical rails as firm as anything every imagined.  \n\nReaching behind his seat, Georgy pulled out a foil packet and pulled off a plastic cap.  The other two looked skeptically at the 'TOILET DISINFECTENT' label on the side as the captain extended the pouch to them.  Vlad was the first to smell it, and his jaw opened in shock.  \"Bozhe moi, that is Vodka!\"  He took the pouch, swalled a slug of the space contraband and passed it along to Viktor who followed suit.\n\nTaking the offered pouch back, Georgy drank deeply as well.  \"It seemed a shame not to have the means to celebrate our successes.\"  He laughed, looking around at the half dead ship on the other side of the hatch and the capsule within which they sat.\n\nLaughing, the three passed the pouch back and forth, ignoring the clock on the wall.  A low rumble began as the Konstantin Tsiolkovsky touched the Martian atmosphere.  \nNever designed for entry, it began to shake and heat unevenly.  The burn that had carefully placed it on its final course had set it to not quite hit the ground, but to instead dip deeply into the atmosphere and slow. \n \nThe original flyby mission in tatters and with no way to return, the Soviet Cosmonauts made the one decision so many were denied back at home.  Whether at work or at sea or deep in the jungles of south east asia, so many were unable to choose the means and timing of their passing.  The three had decided to take fate into their hands one final time and as the solar panels ripped free and the former station turned interplanetary ship began to slowly spin while tongues of plasma from the atmospheric entry licked around the edges, they sang and drank, soon to be the first men...  on Mars.",

            "comment": "I don't even know how we found it. Mars is a big planet, albeit not as big as Earth, but we did. The scythe and hammer. The questions flowed through my head at lightspeed. Why didn't the Soviets tell us what happened? Actually, why didn't they tell their people? Nobody knows. It seems that all known people who worked on Soviet space program disappeared.\n\nThe discovery shocked the world more than the fact that we've actually reached Mars. There was a Russian on our team, Michail, and when we saw that half-bleached pink cloth, and found the hammer and scythe on it he laughed and said \"Vot syka, ebat' menya v zhopy\". No idea what that meant - but he was more shocked than me. \n\nWe got a message to NASA right away - they wanted to keep it a secret but I threatened to tell everyone, so they actually released the information. All the news channels were flooded for a whole week. The Internet exploded with conspiracy theories and reused jokes. Russian government issued a statement that they \"had not a single idea of how it was possible\" and Putin, probably the only bastard on the planet who remembers USSR, was asked about it on his visit to Washington. \n\nWhile we were on Mars we did what you'd expect the Mars expedition to do - collected more samples, ran diagnostics, all that boring stuff. But every so often we would find some more evidence of the Soviet landing - a piece of radio equipment, a footprint in a cave or a buried used nuclear reactor. During the entire mission I felt that what I wanted to do my all life - something that nobody ever done before - was actually done seemingly a century ago. It wasn't something extraordinary - it was a second place, a \"participation trophy\".\n\nWhen I was going through a cave to collect some underground samples, I found... a glove. A fucking glove. On Mars. I wanted to go back and tell the others, but then I noticed the owner. He had his helmet shattered to tiniest pieces, but the face was preserved in the vacuum. I could make out all the features, the mole on his right cheek, the frozen eyes and dark brown hair. It was as if he died only hours ago. The suit had a Soviet red flag on it, but it was a very good one, not much different from what Russia used at the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nI was startled by the body, and forgot completely about calling the others. What happened to this guy? Was it an accident, or something more? I decided to go deeper into the cave. I know, stupid, how did I become an astronaut with this stupidity. But wouldn't you want to know? It's Mars, this was one of the first people to set foot on it, and he dies in a cave with a glove torn from the suit? Hardly seems likely. So, I started going. It wasn't easy. They cave wasn't fit for a spacesuit, so the pace was slow. But after about 10 minutes of crouching and walking I reached the end. That was it. The cave just ended, like they do on Earth. Except there was a sample collector in the wall. It was full, but untouched. The dead guy did find his way to the end of the cave, just like I did. But why didn't he take the samples? Why was his glove torn off near the entrance?\n\nI didn't want to waste time to take the new samples, so I just took the Soviet ones. It's important to not waste anything in space, okay? When I picked it up, the dust flew all around the cave. Yeah, imagine forgetting your laptop in a cave on Mars for a century, see how dusty it gets. I went back to crouch and walk to the top. As I reached the entrance, I saw a silhouette of one of my crew mates. \"Help me out with this one, will ya?\" I said. Little did I notice, that the dead astronaut was gone. Well, not gone. I still saw him. He was standing in the entrance, his silhouette black against the bright red sands of Mars...",

            "comment": "Gallagher frowned at his instruments, sure that there must be some mistake. He tapped the scanner with a gloved finger and slammed the rover into park. \n\n\"I'm getting something strange here, folks,\" he said into his radio. \"Scanning again.\" There must be some mistake, he thought again, as he pinged the scanner again. There it was. A faint reading, but it was there. \n\n\"Uhhhh...\" he trailed off into his radio. \"Commander, I'm pretty sure I'm picking up a signal here.\" Yes, there was definitely a signal. A faint electronic reading from several miles out. He shifted the rover back into drive and began making his way towards the signal, not waiting for confirmation from the commander. He was sure she would tell him to investigate, and he smiled faintly when a few seconds later she did so. \n\nTwenty minutes later he was at the source of the signal. He had pulled the rover into a small gorge and under a rocky outcropping. \"What the fuck...\" he breathed. A Soviet flag protruded from the rocks, next to what appeared to be an old bulkhead door.\n\n\"Are you guys seeing this?\" Gallagher asked his team back at the habitat. \"Are you guys fucking seeing this?\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Finally the commander spoke, informing him that they were indeed seeing it. Gallagher couldn't stop shaking. It made sense that they wouldn't have seen the flag on the satellites under the outcropping of rock. Gallagher climbed out of the rover, grabbing the portable scanner. He approached the bulkhead and began brushing the years of Martian dust away. He found an access panel adjacent to the door and popped the screws off with his multitool. \n\n\"This door is still getting some juice. I'm going to try to bypass.\" As he said this, he realized that someone had scratched a few words into the bulkhead. He didn't speak Russian. \"Can you guys get that translated?\" The commander confirmed that they would get on it, and Gallagher was able to get the door open. It shuddered to life and slowly creaked open. The USSR had fallen almost eighty years ago. He wondered how old this bulkhead was. He wondered a lot of things, but he could barely process the information before him, let alone start speculating. He popped on his headlamp and stepped into the airlock. It cycled and he made his way inside.\n\nThe lights were still on, flickering on and off lazily. He found himself filled with an overwhelming sense of dread. \"Hello?\" he called tentatively. \"Anyone home?\"\n\nHe made his way through what seemed to be a natural cave complex, fitted with O2 scrubbers and other amenities. A rec room with a ping pong table, a poster of the 1980 Soviet hockey team. A kitchen, complete with moldy, desiccated food still on plates. \n\nHis footsteps seemed unnaturally loud as they continuously broke the sepulchral quiet. He passed an open doorway as he moved down the corridor and did a double take. Something had caught his eye as he passed. He turned, peering into the room, eyes widening in horror. He emptied the contents of his stomach into his helmet. The viewport heated up to allow the chunks to slide down into his suit, giving him a clear view of the horror that was this outposts bunkroom. Bones from at least a dozen humans scattered the room haphazardly, in great piles, as if placed deliberately. \n\n\"Ohfuckohfuckofuck\" he began repeating, over and over with increased urgency. He didn't know what the fuck was going on but he knew he needed to get the hell out of here right now. \n\n\"Gallagher!\" the commander shouted again. He realized she had been saying his name for several seconds. \"We translated the writing on the bulkhead. You need to get the hell out of there right now!\"\n\n\"What does it say?,\" he breathed, feeling paralyzed. \n\n\"Stay out! Hostile lifeform inside,\" the commander recited. From deeper in the outpost, a ghastly snarl sounded out.  ",

The TV shows a weary man in his sixties. \"As you may already know,\" he says, \"we have been withholding images from our Curiosity rover mission for some time. Some of you may believe that we have been doing it for years, but that's wrong. We have been doing it for sixteen days. But now we are sure that there is no mistake and that it's pointless to conceal our discovery.\"\n\nI sip the remains of the cold tea I had left on my table before going to bed early, wondering if I'm still dreaming. If it was real, I should already be hearing screams of joy of numerous conspiracy theorists, dancing and throwing their foil hats into the air.\n\n\"Sixteen days ago we found an artificial object on Mars. It is very unlikely to have been delivered by any unmanned mission we are aware about. There are no known landing sites in its vicinity. We can't identify any tracks around it, but there might be something under the dust that we can find after careful examination. Perhaps we will have to send another rover equipped specifically for this mission now that we know what to look for.\"\n\n\"Anyway, we have found an artifact, it took us sixteen days to get to it and inspect it. We have no doubt that it is a Soviet flag.\"\n\nThe old TV shows a series of photos of a flag hanging on a pole. On the progression of photos it looks twitchy.\n\n\"The Martian wind isn't usually strong enough to make it wave, but what can be seen in the upper left corner of it is definitely sickle and hammer. We don't know of any mission that was capable of delivering it. The Soviet rovers from missions Mars-2 and Mars-3 couldn't carry it for sure, and Mars-4NM and Mars-5NM were canceled due to lack of a sufficiently powerful heavy carrier rocket.\"\n\n\"Curiosity is equipped with the ChemCam instrument, which allows to vaporise a cubic millimeter of matter with a laser burst and inspect its composition via spectrography. Unfortunately we can't examine the flag itself as it is too high, all that's available is the pole.\"\n\n\"And so we did it. We analyzed the pole. It is very likely to be something like wood, something that was alive once.\" He draws a deep breath. \"And it definitely isn't from Earth.\"",

However, if landing on the moon was a leap, my stepping here on Mars would be like a plane ride.\"\n\nMayers laughed. \"Don't knock on what Neil Armstrong did. It was important, and is what brought us here.\"\n\n\"I'm not knocking on what he did, just making an observation. We probably should check in with Houston.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we probably should.\"\n\n\"Houston, we have touched down. Mars is something completely different. Amazing. Beautiful I'd even wager. Over.\"\n\n\"That's great news Murray. We're glad to hear you landed safe. What do you see? Over.\"\n\n\"The red sea.\" I broke out into a laugh at my poor attempt at a joke. When I finally stopped laughing, I was able to choke out \"Over.\"\n\n\"I think your laugh at that shitty joke was much better. Any signs of life? Over.\"\n\n\"Not yet. We still have to explore some though. According to HAL, we should be able to explore for about 3 hours before we need to return to the ship, over.\"\n\n\"Keep us updated. Out.\"\n\nI looked around and all I could see was red. Everywhere. I look at Mayers, \"Which way?\"\n\n\"Forward.\"\n\n\"Let's begin.\"\n\nWe walk forward. The new suits NASA designed for us make it seem like we are still walking on Earth. It's an amazing advancement, and makes this exploration so much better. \"Wait, there's something we need to do.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nI head back to the ship and grab the American flag. \"We can't forget this baby.\" I stab it down into the ground. \"'Murica.\"\n\nI catch up to where Mayers is standing and we continue on. \"I think it would make sense to get on top of one of those hills. We will be able to see more.\"\n\n\"Sounds good.\"\n\nWe slightly change course to a nearby hill. The hike up it didn't provide much trouble, but I still needed to catch my breath a little bit after it. We look around and see something in the distance. \"What the hell is that? It's definitely not a hill.\"\n\n\"I'm not quite sure. Radio it in.\"\n\n\"Erm... Houston, we see something. It's relatively skinny, definitely not a hill and from the distance looks like it isn't natural. What should we do, over?\"\n\n\"Wait for instructions, Murray. We'll be back in a moment, over.\"\n\nMayers and myself sit down on the hill staring at it. It's just a black shade in the distance. \"HAL, how much more time do we have?\"\n\n\"1 hour 13 minutes 22 seconds remaining.\"\n\n\"Thanks HAL.\"\n\nMayers and I look at each other. \"Think we can make it today?\"\n\n\"If Houston gets back to us.\" \n\nWe sit for a few more minutes and then hear some static. \"Murray, Mayers, this is James with Houston. We would like you to approach the object. Be careful, and be ready to hightail it out of there. Out.\"\n\nMayers and I stand up, and begin the journey to the object. As we get closer, we both stop in amazement. \"Houston, there is a problem. Over.\"\n\n\"Yes? Over.\"\n\n\"It seems like someone beat us here. It's a Soviet flag, over.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, can you repeat that, over?\"\n\n\"It's an old Soviet flag here. Over.\"\n\n\"Return to the ship, and we'll give more instructions soon. Out.\"\n\nI look at Mayers, \"Head back now, or explore around here a little bit.\"\n\n\"Let's explore a bit.\"\n\nWe walk around the flag looking for any other signs of their time here. Suddenly, my foot hits something and I fall over to the ground. After I regain my composure, I turn around to see what I tripped over.\n\n\"Uhh... Mayers, get over here.\"\n\nIn a few minutes, Mayers is at my side and we both stare down in amazement. The body of an old Soviet astronaut lies in front of us. I bend down and wipe the dust off of the glass cover, but then I recoil in horror.\n\n\"What the fuck is wrong with him!?\"\n\nMayers bends down and examines him closer.\n\n\"Houston, come in now, over.\"\n\n\"What is the issue, Mayers? Over.\"\n\n\"We decided to explore the area a bit more. We found something else. Over.\"\n\n\"What is it, over.\"\n\n\"It's the body of one of the Soviet astronauts. Somethings terribly wrong with him. His eyes are black as the night, and it looks like all of his veins turned black as well. Over.\"\n\n\"Get out of there, guys. Now. Over.\"\n\n\"You don't have to tell us twice, out.\"\n\nMayers and I start heading back to the ship.\n\n\"Help...\" we hear meekly.\n\nWe both stop dead in our tracks, and whirl around. \"What the fuck?!\"\n\nThe astronaut has sat up and is staring right at us. \"Help...\" he says again.\n\n\"How the fuck?\" I say in shock, \"It's time to leave.\" I turn around but I see Mayers hasn't yet. \"Mayers! Let's move. This isn't right. He shouldn't be alive. He can't be.\"\n\nMayers turns to look at me and the first thing I notice is his eyes. They're black. I look over at the old Soviet astronaut and he is back on the ground, dead. Oh fuck no. I start to back up slowly.\n\n\"Mayers... what's wrong.\"\n\n\"Nothing, Murray. Why would you think something is wrong.\"\n\n\"Erm... your eyes aren't exactly.. normal.\"\n\nMayers starts walking a bit faster towards me. \"Nothings wrong with my eyes. I see just fine.\" \n\nI hightail it back to the ship, or I try to. Before I know it, Mayers has thrown me to the ground. \"Where are you going, Murray.\"\n\n\"I need to get back to the ship. Inform Houston of what we've found.\"\n\n\"That's okay, I'll do it.\"\n\nSuddenly, I see Mayers fist coming down at me, but I can't cover my mask before it hits it. The glass helmet shatters, and instantly I can't breath. \"Mayers... why...\" I choke out.\n\n\"Houston, we have a problem. We need an evac immediately. Murray's helmet has shattered. We're heading back to the ship. Over.\"\n\n\"Evac is on it's way. Out.\"\n\nMayers bends down to me, but I barely recognize it's him because everything is getting so dark. I see him grinning wide, and then barely hear \"Thanks.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks to /u/The_White_Light for explaining they don't actually say \"Over and Out,\" just \"Out.\" ",

            "comment": "It didn't take long for the conspiracies to take hold. An old Soviet flag was found on Mars by the astronauts on their first mission there. \n\n\"The astronauts were paid by Russia to try and make a new claim to fame. It's completely impossible that the USSR was actually on Mars.\" \n\n\"The Soviets probably discovered Alien life and were brought up to Mars to be experimented on, they must've also put that face on Mars as a message based on the faces of the cosmonauts!\" \n\n\"It's totally possible, the ancient Jesuits have been known to have incredibly advanced technology! The Soviets must have repurposed it for their own use!\"\n\n\"The US is just using this to create more conflict between it and Russia, I'm sure soon we'll discover there's oil in Russia and then we'll deliver some hot, sticky, freedom to them.\" \n\nA lot of people were torn on the issue. There was no reason for the astronauts to lie. Supposedly the astronauts took many images of the dated Soviet flag they found but kept them secret. There were other more mundane pictures of Mars released to the public, but no flag pictures had ever come up. The astronauts claimed they kept the images secret until they landed, then immediately went to the press to share what they found, but by then they claim the government had destroyed all evidence. \n\nIt was quite the story and many didn't believe it. The US government wasn't commenting at first, but after the story got enough traction there was a very simple statement made by NASA that it had done no such thing and while the mission to Mars was a success and plenty of valuable research data was received there were no old flags or signs of human life to be found. They stated they weren't sure why their astronauts were telling stories all of a sudden, but the head of the program in a conference made some hints towards the \"eccentricity\" of some of the members and their romanticized notions of the Soviet Republic. \n\nPeople didn't know how to make sense of the story, certainly if the government wanted to keep this whole thing under wraps they would have dealt with the astronauts in some way to keep them silent. Why even keep it a secret then? Why let the astronauts talk? \n\nThere were many questions about why let alone *how* the USSR could put anything on Mars let alone evidence of landing on it. The Russian media was loving the sudden rise in attention and Putin made some joking remarks to the kinds of people the US trusts with such important tasks. But with continued trouble in the Middle East, European radicals taking immigration issues into their own hands, and China beginning to put continued pressure on a Japan that was expanding its military every day, this story eventually became no more than a myth propogated by part of the population, oddly becoming quite popular among moon-landing conspirators, and believing the otherwise reliable astronauts would become a bit of a joke.\n\n\"Seriously? You believe that story?\" Jessica said to her classmate.\n\n\"Yeah, my Dad was watching documentaries about it. I'm pretty sure it's true, we know the US government destroys evidence after all.\" Retorted Alex, looking somewhat red in the face.\n\n\"That's stupid and you know it, there's just way too many assumptions you'd have to make when you could just, like, say they lied. Next you're gonna tell me to watch 'loose change' and start insisting on a second shooter or something.\" She clearly wasn't going to consider the possibility or was particularly interested in it to begin with. And really, not many people were these days, Alex knew he was in a minority there, even the moon landing deniers had larger numbers. \n\nAlex looked crestfallen, but within a few years he'd graduate high school and then go to college. Everything he learned in that time would make it clear just how impossible the whole situation was and he'd be content with the idea that now he knew better.\n\n(I don't usually write in this sub, or in general, but when I saw that most of the stories were about the experience of the astronaut's view I wanted to write about what it meant for everyone else back home, if it meant anything. I hope I get at least some traction, let me know what you think!)",

            "comment": "Colonel Anderson kneeled down in front of a broken pole and wiped away some orange dust off the ground, revealing a tattered piece of crimson cloth stuck under a rock. Dragging it out of its resting place, the Colonel tore it in half, showing the two men behind him a symbol of a gold hammer and sickle beneath a gold-bordered red star. \n\n\"It can't be...\" said Lieutenant Colonel Haynes. \"Colonel, that's a soviet flag. A union of communist nations that dissolved nearly two hundred years ago.\"\n\nColonel Anderson sighed and tried to stroke his gray beard, but remembered he was wearing a spacesuit. He then shook his head saying:\n\n\"I don't like this, Haynes. We're supposed to be the first humans here. What's a relic like this doing in Mars?\"\n\n\"Aliens?\" said Lieutenant Colonel Wilfery. \"Did they get killed off by aliens?!?\"\n\nHaynes rolled his eyes and said:\n\n\"There's no such thing as aliens, you dunce. Well, at least not on Mars. They probably had an accident and couldn't return back home.\"\n\n\"Maybe they were unable to contact Earth\" said Colonel Anderson. \"These... 'soviets' assumed the mission was a failure and never reported on it out of shame, or something like that. Regardless, that distress beacon is still pinging. We need to find its source before we do anything else.\" He scoffed with a sly grin. \"Maybe one of them is still alive.\"\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe three astronauts hiked a tall mountain they encountered on their way to the beacon. Gusts of wind suddenly caressed the men, causing them to be buffeted by specks of red sand. Ignoring the harsh exterior conditions inside the comfort of his spacesuit, Lieutenant Colonel Wilfery said:\n\n\"So why are you so sure there aren't any aliens here?\"\n\n\"Because of the rover Curiosity!\" replied Haynes, through a bit of static interference in their radio. \"About a hundred and fifty years ago it explored the martian surface and didn't find anything.\"\n\n\"A stoner's curiosity?\" said Wilfery. \"What's weed got to do with this? Did they really send an undergraduate student ahead of us?\"\n\nThe gales rapidly increased in strength and ferocity the closer they got to the peak. Enveloping them in what seemed like crimson mist, the dust clouds got denser, to the point of almost being tangible, and obscured anything five meters ahead of them. Slamming his palm into his helmet, Haynes then said:\n\n\"Rover! R-O-V-E-R. It was a reconnaissance robot sent to study Mars' geology. It didn't find any life after decades of searching, so yeah, I'm pretty confident there aren't any aliens here!\"\n\n\"Would you two just shut up and focus on the situation at hand?!?\" shouted Colonel Anderson, barely visible in front of them. \"We're in the middle of a sandstorm here! One wrong step and we break our necks on this mountain!\"\n\nJust as he finished speaking, Colonel Anderson grabbed a loose rock and fell backwards. He screamed for his life while airborne, his horror subsiding once his men caught him by the arm. Wilfery grinned and said:\n\n\"Teaching by example, I see! A testament to your great leadership skills, colonel!\"\n\nColonel Anderson narrowed his eyes and grunted at Wilfery, looking downwards in shame once his subordinates weren't looking. \n\n -----------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce they got to the peak, the sandstorm had already subsided, making the descent a lot easier than the climb. The distress signal was beeping stronger the more they walked through the empty plains, giving Wilfery an uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach. Marching behind the others didn't help his uneasiness. His back was exposed to whatever could be behind them and everything was too quiet, too still for his liking. The flat landscape they traversed looked more like a desert drenched in dried blood than an alien planet. Even the ground beneath his feet felt *wrong*. It was probably the difference in gravity to Earth's, but he still couldn't ignore the thought that everything reacted differently here. \n\nLooking over his shoulder, Wilfery widened his eyes with fear. The soil turned pitch black and flowed in bumps towards them, rising and falling like streaks of ink in a hostile sea of red dust. Wilfery immediately ran to his companions screaming:\n\n\"The soil guys! The ground's out to get us!\"\n\nHaynes turned around with tense shoulders, but quickly relaxed his body. He then shook his head, sighed, and said:\n\n\"No it isn't. The ground isn't sentient Wilfery, it's just subterranean water rising from the ground.\"\n\n\"Subterranean water?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" replied Haynes. \"they're called 'Recurring Slope Lineae'. It's summer here, and highly saline water tends to flow this way during this time of the year.\"\n\nColonel Anderson laughed loudly and walked up to the darkened sand. He then touched its damp texture and said:\n\n\"I can't believe you're a Lieutenant, Wilfery. Really? Wet sand? What's next? An abandoned soviet station filled with zombi-\"\n\nThe sand sprung from the ground and pierced Anderson's suit through his arm. He quickly jumped away from it, but it was already too late. The dust flowed into his spacesuit, filling it up until inflating it slightly and freezing him there with its added weight. Anderson's ear piercing screams were then muffled by the sand, who choked the life out of him by forcing itself down his throat. \n\nWilfery and Haynes gaped in terror, seeing Anderson's eyes pop out and being followed by a viscous fluid that fell from his sockets like crude oil. They turned around, trying to run away, but their knees weakened and tripped them over. The sand inched its way to their helmets, twisting itself around their calves and anchoring them to the ground. Clawing at the floor with their hands, they dragged themselves away from the black tendrils for a few feet, before being forcefully drawn into the darkness again.\n\nThe two men then faced each other and nodded, silently resigning themselves to their end. Once the black sand reached their necks, it covered them like a blanket and stopped crushing them with its pressure. Footsteps suddenly crunched nearby, coming from Anderson's body who stood in front of them. In a coarse and headache inducing voice his body said:\n\n\"Get out of our planet, humans. It belongs to *us*!\"\n\n\"W-we come in peace\" said Wilfery. \"Yes, its *your* planet. We have no intention from taking it from you.\"\n\n\"Really?!?\" shouted the voice. \"That's exactly what the others said, but once we tapped into their memories, we saw they had other plans instead.\" The limp body raised its arms. \"Colonization! On *our* planet. They thought they claimed it by sticking a pole in the ground!\"\n\n\"They didn't know you lived here!\" said Haynes. \"*We* didn't know you lived here! Please, surely seeing humans must've been surprising to you too!\"\n\n\"Yes...\" The voice trailed off, pausing for a few seconds. \"We didn't know much of you lifeforms when they first came, so we possessed all of them, thinking you were a hive-mind like us. We knew more of you would come, so we used their trinkets to call you to our location. This time, we're leaving some of you alive to send a message. Never come back to Mars again. Stay off our planet and don't you *dare* claim it as yours.\"\n  \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt;If you enjoyed this, you can check out more of my stories over at /r/WeirdEmoKidStories!",

On Mars? The USSR itself has fallen into oblivion, getting no more than a footnote in history textbooks these days.\n\nAnd the implications were grave. Only few still know the turbulent past our planet has been through. The violent ages, the era of constantly bickering nation-states. The Unification War of 2084 saw those remnants of the past buried, and the new, unitary world order arise. The people of Earth have known only orderly, peaceful existance since then, all links to the past purged from memory.\n\nAnd now, one of those symbols has surfaced, on another planet. The Prime Director knew it couldn't be covered up.",

            "comment": "Sarah crested the red ridge and her heart burst. She had almost literally moved mountains to be here. And now the rocks, sand and dust she had memorized for years lay before her. Her view from the southern slope of Olympus Mons stretched for kilometers--though that seemed too small a unit to measure what she could see. It felt like she could see for light years. She could feel the stretch of time and space across this ancient landscape. She could feel it stretch across her own landscape, tracing her journey from the wheat fields of Washington, where she learned her love of the stars, through the naval academy and, eventually, here on the fourth rock from the sun.\n\nShe felt she could see everything, but soon only one thing dominated her vision: something that looked like--but could not possibly be--a metal pole with a red and yellow flag drooping to its side.\n\nSarah called out, \"Jordan, I'm climbing down a klick to a crater that may have some exposed metal.\" \"Sure thing, Skip.\"\n\nThe object that could not have been a flagpole was nestled into a crater, and looked like it would be in the shadows almost the entire day.  Sarah had only caught a small glint from the top few millimeters of the pole that was in the light, but it was enough.\n\nAs she climbed down, she thought about all the factors that had brought her so far: the dissolution of NASA and the privatization of the American space program, the food shortages in Asia that had destabilized a third of the world's population, and the wild hope that low-grav farming on Mars would someday solve the problems on Earth.  While she was not on Mars to prospect for metals, the Mars First Consortium would not say no to anything useful.  And so she descended under the guise that she was prospecting.  She knew the truth though--whatever she was chasing was far above and beyond her pay grade.\n\nShe reached the crater and found what she would have called a path to the floor of the crater, except there weren't any paths on Mars.  She reached the floor of the crater, and all her instruments went dark.  Her rebreather was working fine, it could handle a power outage, but coms, lights, and navigation were all off.  She tried to reboot her suit, to no avail.  Things were weird enough, so she decided to press on the 50 meters to the \"flagpole\" anyway.\n\nSarah had walked over all kinds of Martian dust, or sand or gravel, but she hadn't seen anything like the bottom of the crater.  It was oddly smooth, as if it had been sanded down and polished, with a thin layer of dust to coat it and a few rocks and boulders strewn around for show.  She couldn't shake the feeling that she should be anywhere but in that crater, out of the sunlight, with no communications.  She was not exactly afraid, she just had that old familiar feeling that what she was about to do was intensely stupid and yet inevitable she would do it.  It was like when she ate a whole ghost pepper on Charlie's dare on her honeymoon.  A terrible decision, but one she had to make anyway.  Come to think of it, Charlie himself was one of those terrible decisions.\n\nShe reached the flagpole.  There was no denying it any longer.  It was about five feet high, perfectly cylindrical in shape, and of course there was no mistaking the hammer and sickle flag that indicated the Soviets (or someone pretending to be them) had marked their time in this crater.\n\nAnother stupid decision: she touched the pole.  A jolt ran through her finger, up her arm and through her body.  That wasn't supposed to be possible with the padding in her glove, but she found herself splayed on the ground shaking anyway.  Actually, she wasn't shaking, the ground was.  She tried to get to her feet as a thicker darkness rose around her and swallowed the skies above her, but it was no use.  She was being lowered underground.  All she could do was wait it out.\n\nSarah sat, and waited, well away from the flagpole (she wasn't making that mistake again).  She may have dozed off, it felt like she was descending for hours, or it might have been a couple of minutes.\n\nFinally, her platform reached its destination.  A door opened into a spartan metallic corridor with blinding incandescent lights.  Sarah took a moment to adjust her eyes and began to explore the corridor.  She was familiar enough with Russian design from her days training for the ISS that she could see many of the same influences.  There was something to the platform, the shape and color of the metal, the design (or lack thereof) of the panels making up the corridor, that gave her a nostalgic feeling of training for a Soyuz mission.\n\nShe reached a door to another room.  It was ajar.  She pushed it open and gasped.  On a series of ancient monitors, yet in surprisingly high definition, she watched as pivotal moments of her life played out: her first kiss, her graduation, the moment she knew she had to divorce Charlie to achieve her dreams...  The room looked and felt old.  The monitors had even older terminals with keyboards set in Russian, though a few looked newer and seemed to have standard Qwerty keyboards in English.  The chairs were steel and looked exceedingly uncomfortable, but looked as if they were polished yesterday.  Sarah's eyes were drawn back to the monitors, where the center screen flashed a message in English.\n\n\"Hello Sarah, we have been waiting for you...\"\n\n\"Hello? Who is there?\" Sarah said, once in English and once in Russian.\n\nA new message flashed onto the screen, \"We are.\"\n\n\"Who is 'we'?\"\n\n\"Come and see for yourself...\"  A small, unassuming door towards the rear of the room opened with a click and a hiss.  Sarah felt compelled to step through.  She still hadn't shaken the feeling that she should just run away and hide, but her curiosity was overwhelming.\n\nShe entered the back room, her stomach dropping out when she saw what it contained.  Three grotesque Russian men stood before her.  They each had ugly steel and metals protruding from their bodies at odd angles in odd places, with plastic tubing ferrying liquids throughout their bodies.  Their military uniforms were tattered.  It seemed their backs were impossibly straight.  Each man's eyes had been replaced by small metallic balls that twirled constantly.  Their mouths were wired shut, and they had antennas sticking out of their skulls.  It looked as if they had an intake port shunted into their necks.  They were expressionless and, strangely enough, held hands with each other.  And the man in the center had a screen affixed to his chest.\n\nAnother message: \"We are the Sputnik.  We want to go home.\"  Sarah's heart ached for the men these once were.  \"The process for conversion was imperfect for these bodies, but we have refined our techniques in the past decades.\"  Sarah's feeling of dread doubled.  The door closed behind her.  \"We have been watching you and waiting.  You have the determination to succeed where we did not.  And you have brought us a ship to get home.\"  Sarah tugged at the door to get out of the room as the bodies slowly slid toward her, their legs never moving from the ground.  \"Our people abandoned us, but you will not.  You will lead us into the new age.\"  The things that were once men closed in around her.  She heaved at the door once more, digging her feet in, and the latch broke.  She ran from the room, down the corridor, praying the elevator would work for her once more.",

Really very funny. You know you're making history with the first practical joke on the planet Mars.\"\n\nAnother click, and Art Lyman's disembodied voice filled the channel.\n\n\"Did I do what?

It might have been funnier if it was the eighties, this joke went out of style about the same time as your first name.\"\n\n\"Oh ha-ha, that joke's getting pretty stale too. Seriously, what're you blaming me for?\"\n\nFollowing a brief tone, an image appeared on the screen of Lyman's wrist computer. He wiped off some of the fine oxide dust, and squinted at it through his visor.\n\n\"What the hell is that?\"\n\nIt was a view taken from a wind-blown clifftop, overlooking a deep crater. He could just make out some tracks in the sand below.\n\n\"You know I'm honestly sort of impressed Lyman, where did you find the time to do this? \n\n\"Is that due east of the hab? I haven't even been over there. Besides it's, what, some rover tracks? It was probably Polchek.\"\n\n\"It's Cyrillic, moron. Didn't your parents try to culture you when you were younger?\"\n\n\"It's windy, my visor is scratched, there's dust all over...\"\n\n\"You know I'm kidding, Lyman. You know what, isn't Polchek's grandmother Russian? It probably was him.\"\n\nPolchek's voice crackled over the com. \"It wasn't me\"\n\n\"You really expect me to believe that? There are only three people on this whole planet.\"\n\n\"I've been in the hab all week, check my logs.\"\n\n\"C'mon, there's no way -\"\n\nLyman interrupted. \"Sharon, that image you sent, bottom right...what is that? Just outside the crater's shadow, little red thing. I mean, I know it's *all* red, but the thing redder than that.\"\n\nSharon adjusted her suit camera, and an enlarged image arrived on all their screens.\n\n\"Is that...\" Lyman trailed off, and Polchek chimed in.\n\n\"It's...a flag? It's a *Soviet* flag Sharon, what the fuck.\"\n\nThe pinprick of a sun had crested the crater rim, and the deep shadows began to retreat. Sharon's faraway voice drifted across the com.\n\n\"Hey Polchek\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"You read Russian?\"\n\n\"A little\"\n\n\"What's it say?\"\n\nShe sent him a wider shot, and went back to panning the brightening crater. \n\n\"It looks like...no, that's not it...\", Polchek muttered.\n\nA white flash caught Sharon's eye, and she increased the magnification on her suit cam. Her voice developed a mild tremor. \"Polchek? Polchek tell me what it says.\"\n\n\"It looks like...*ver...vernut*\"\n\nHer view had centered on a tiny rover, mired in the dust.\n\n\"What's it mean, Polchek?\"\n\n\"It means...'come back'.\"\n\n At the upper limit of her zoom, she could just make out another object less than five yards away, almost completely covered in the rusty sand. Sun glinted off a broken visor, and a rust-red glove clutched an ashen rock.\n\nShe stood for a moment. Privately, she wondered if anyone had even seen the message. She flicked the com switch.\n\n\"Nasty way to go.\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\nShe swept her arms across the barren expanse, even though neither Polchek nor Lyman could see her. \"All this emptiness.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you when I get back\". She paused for a moment, and then turned back toward the hab, tracking rusty bootprints all the way.",

The feeling of just being, well lack for better words, scared? Well, that\u2019s what I felt like when I, James Legstrong got to mars.\nIt was a long trip of about 3 years but it was worth it. We had been orbiting for the past day and had been looking for the best place to land. We decided on a nice clearing where there was some mountains nearby. After confirming with home, we got ready to rocket down to the red planet's surface. Even getting into the atmosphere, it looked like nothing I had ever seen before. Beautifully red and orange, it was the greatest thing I had ever seen. I also had an amazing feeling because I would be, along with my partner, the first people to ever set foot or lay eyes on it from this distance.\nWe landed and had to put on our suits before we went out. My partner and I both shook hands and said that we stick together, while also doing the U.S salute. This was not only being broadcasted on live television, but listened to by most of the world. It was a monumental achievement.\nI stepped foot out first, with a big grin on my face. I looked around along with my partner and I noticed something quite\u2026 Strange. There was another space pod already landed nearby. We contacted home only to see that it was not ours, or anything we\u2019d sent out previously. It was even in an odd shape with a disk. We decided that we\u2019d approach with caution.\nWe got as close as we could, only to see that there was an imprint on the side of the pod. It was covered in the red dust so we had to wipe it off only to see something horrifying. At first it was just red, but as we got to the corners, we could see some yellow, then we saw it. It looked like a flag.\nMy partner and I wanted to go in badly, but couldn\u2019t until we got confirmation. After a while of arguments between staff and others but they finally gave us permission.\nThe pod door opened with a woosh sound of air flowing out. We got in to see a carnage of materials, notebooks, and clothes flung around. There was some type of creatures there. We were given directions not to touch them though, as they could be contaminated. There was also computers, so we decided to look through them.\nIt had no password so we got on easily and opened a summary of the people on the vessel. After looking through we saw the species of these creatures, they were called\u2026 humans.\n",

            "comment": "When human feet finally touched the surface of Mars, it was under the aegis of no government.  De-centeralized social structures, growing rapidly under the influence of a de-centralized information network, had replaced government.  It had turned out that cooperation only required adequate communication.\n\nAnd, it had taken several hundred years.  The old notions of country and nation, had blurred together.  Humanity had endured a crisis.  History had slept, and rolled off the bed, and sat up startled.  We reached the red planet.\n\nIt had always been right in our reach.  A group of intrepid explorers, united by the promise of freedom and reward, had made their way here.  I was among them.  It was I who discovered the hatch, buried in the red sand.  I was out surveying with my partner, and within his puffy white suit, his shoulders immediately squared up.  John was on the guard for threats.  \n\nI did not know Russian, but I knew what it looked like.  C.C.C.P. was an unfamiliar moniker to me, but the writing style looked familiar.  I had read history.  It was something I meant to bring to Mars, not study while I was there.\n\n\"This is obviously very old,\" I said.  \"It could be up to eighty years.\"\n\n\"I don't want you playing with that,\" he said.  \"We don't know what's behind it.\"\n\nHe might have seemed patronizing, but I could tell he was just protecting me.  People had put this thing here.  Could they still be around? \n\nEventually, several other Dunists (our enclave's name for itself) had gathered to look at the mysterious hatch with us.  Finally someone attempted to open it.\n\nA loud hiss, a blast of steam drove us away.  We staggered back, fearful our suits would be torn open.  The thin air wouldn't kill us immediately, but it could be fatal.  I stumbled into my partner's arms, and we retreated together.\n\nWhen we returned to view the hatch a second time, blackness greeted us.  Descending into the pit, with a hand-light, I led the way, John protectively watching my back, another partner-pair about thirty meters back.  We were struck by the almost organic composition of the walls.  This didn't look carved or blasted, it looked like something had burrowed it out.  With teeth.\n\nThere were scattered square edges and shapes, pieces of equipment that belonged in our world, that looked out of place in this one.  John stopped and gently brushed the dust aside.  \"More Russian,\" I said.  \"And no, I still cannot read it.\"\n\nThe passage, dark and red like the surrounding rocks and sand, wound for three or four hundred meters until it opened into a large ampitheater.\n\nAnd here, we found the gaping hole.  You could look into the gaping hole.  It was so, so very dark.  \n\n\"Shine the laser,\" John suggested.  I had a small laser scanner, meant to return distances.  The light did not brighten any of the surfaces, did not come back.  The scanner saw no bottom.\n\n\"It's rated for ten kilometers,\" I quipped.  \"We should see a bottom, there's no way it can be that deep.\"\n\nMoments later, there was a loud thud.  The ground shook.  Up the passageway, we saw the nameless couple who had joined us, their suits whirling in retreat.  \n\nIt was then that the room lit up with pure energy.  Light poured out of the opening in the floor.  For long seconds, there seemed to be a great whistle of energy blasting through everything in the room.\n\nAnd then, I saw stars.  Quite briefly, in the hole in the ground.  It seemed like they were very, very close.  Like I was looking down into the sky.\n\nNeither of us understood, but we knew that the Russians, whoever they had been, however they had gotten here, had somehow found this bizarre unnatural phenomenon.\n\nAnd wherever they had gone, this was the point of departure.\n\n\"So,\" I asked him.  \"Do you think we could go through there, too?\"\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Elon Musk had always announced his intention for SpaceX to be the first stages towards colonizing Mars, his desire to 'die there, but not on landing'. That was quite few years ago, and that time brings the first rocket drifting into a stable orbit around the Red Planet. No new technical development, no new engine designs, good old rocketry pushed very hard and a dedicated crew to take the radiation hit and months of travel time. They had to be dedicated - they were ordered to be.\n\nIt costs the Chinese a lot. Research money, of course, human lives, naturally, but political capital too. Espionage to delay SpaceX's plans wasn't cheap and smoothing and quietening the ruffles as it gets discovered is pricier still. But certainly worth it - \"First Human on Mars\" would echo through history in a way \"biggest radio telescope for a few years\" or \"third space station\" never will. And it is a title Beijing has its eyes set on as part of their push to promote big-S Science in China.\n\nThe orbiter is bustling with preparations proceeding normally until an interruption from visitors at Mission Control. They are Politicians not engineers or scientists, and they bear no gifts, only command authority and new instructions. The Lander release will be delayed, long enough to move the landing to new coordinates.\n\nThe Lander incorporates lessons learned from the American Moon Landing of the 1960s; one entire side can open so both occupants can leave and descend to the surface simultaneously. Why print one Chinese name in the history books when you can print two? Male and Female side by side in the pilot seats as the lander descends. Male and Female side by side as they check the instruments, and prepare their exit as the technical voiceover recorded on the ground plays over the top, their faces obscured by pressure suit helmets. Male and Female pictured side by side, seen from the Lander chassis camera as the Lander opens wide.\n\nAmazement almost apparent on the sketch of their faces visible through the mirrored visors - this is the image shown to the watching World Media. The associated audio of their observations and expletives is not played to the World Media. Nor is the footage of the Russian Federation flag.\n\nThe Lander and both crew-members lost. Beijing is furious. Blame is floating around and everyone wants to shoo it somewhere else. Arguments so hot the communication lines between government departments give serious consideration to melting. In 1969 the Americans and the Russians raced to the Moon not to *land* but to *pick up something*. The Russians didn't lose the space race, they merely lost the lead. When they went quiet it was to take the wind out of the American People's sails - why fund space when there's no more competition to win? But they only went quiet they didn't stop. Arriving on Mars with 1970s technology was an achievement for sure.\n\nBeijing was never quite sure what happened next - The Russians couldn't make it back, or they couldn't *bring* it back? Mars and back was a stretch to far, but Beijing wasn't expecting that they would have left it *defended*. Officially the USSR was never there at all, so this could only be a critical Lander power supply failure, not a booby trap, not murder, not a declaration of war.\n\nThe Lander and both crewmembers lost. Beijing noticed. Beijing with its active space program, trained astronauts, orbiter around Mars, but nothing ready to launch has most certainly noticed.\n\nSudden bursts of radiation, loss of radio contact. NASA has noticed. NASA with 10-20 billion dollars a year of funding going somewhere, and only a fraction of a space station and the remains of a Mars rover to show for it, what are they developing? They have no public flight ready shuttles, and no political will for manned spaceflight, but they've definitely noticed.\n\nLast minute change of landing, *those* coordinates, no propaganda footage of the first Mars walk, oh the Russians have noticed. Russia still flying their '1970s technology'. They recently announced reduced funding for Roscosmos, but with 70 billion dollars a year in 'military' funding, they have unquestionably noticed.\n\nElon Musk has noticed. SpaceX with the only off-shore launch and land capability, the newest and most innovative and lowest cost rocket manufacturing facilities, independently funded, run with plans from the start to go to Mars. They have no flight certified hardware for humans, but they've absolutely noticed.\n\nand Professor Colin Pillinger - may he rest in peace - would have noticed. The Beagle 2 Mars lander mission he fronted for the European Space Agency in 2003, a lander which 'failed to deploy' for 'unknown reasons', might need to wake up soon.\n\nIt's not a good time for any one of them, but when the starting gun fires, the race is on.\n",

'Look behind you,' it seemed to suggest 'just turn around'.\n\nAlan, as though compelled by some monsterous alien source, began to turn.

            "comment": "First it was the flag. A manned Soviet mission to Mars would have been the ultimate propaganda, but even decades later there had never been any mention of it. When the response from Earth came back, the Russian government claimed that no trace of such a mission existed within their records.\n\nThen it was the ship. Years of wear from the Martian storms had damaged it almost beyond recognition, but a closer inspection began to identify a number of irregularities \u2013 multiple components inside the ship that would have otherwise been protected had been irreparably destroyed. While the damage was haphazard and imprecise, the crew\u2019s engineer concluded that the most likely cause was deliberate sabotage by one or more members of the original team.\n\nThen came the doors. The Soviet team had constructed their base inside a nearby cave system, presumably to hide it from orbital surveys, with the entrance protected by a heavy blast door. The level of security was understandable given the political situation at the time, and it took several hours to repurpose the mining equipment brought on the mission and gain entry, but as the crew ventured further into the base they were faced with door after door. Each was sealed through no small amount of effort \u2013 seams had been welded together, mechanical components had been forcibly fused, control panels had been ripped from the walls, and hydraulic tanks had been drained of their contents.\n\nFinally the team reached the final room of the facility. Schematics from one of the offices indicated it had been a secure storage area, with only one entrance and an isolated life support system in the case of chemical leaks. Once the door had been forced open, the fate of the Soviet crew was finally revealed: shredded suits and shattered bones littered the area, separated with considerable force. Of the cause of the devastation no sign could be found, and a check of the room confirmed that there were no other entrances that hadn\u2019t been recorded on the plans.\n\nHaving completed their search, the team began to make their way back to the surface to report their findings. But the images continued to linger in their minds, and though they dared not say it aloud, every member of the crew could feel a rising sense of dread; as if unseen eyes were burning holes in their backs\u2026",

The thing was made of metal and stuck out of the ground like one of those old vertical banners. It didn't move in the wind, mainly because the wind here is hardly anything, but it did have a distinct etching on the front. The old hammer and sickle. That's wild. The wall fell when I was six, and then we had a man on the moon same year. When did they get time to send a ship all the way out here? I don't know but we hear back tomorrow what we are to do about it, or if we should just leave it. \n\nDAY 31, Mars Base Dragon:\n\nThey wanted us to go retrieve it today, and do some scans of the area. And, I know it was wild yesterday but this is where it gets wilder, we found a whole base! An abandoned base. I mean, we know of it's existence but we haven't gotten a chance to go in yet. They said it would be violating sovereign russian soil, but I mean we are on Mars for goodness sake. The scans showed that it has at least 8 different rooms, and turns out that the flag we found was actually on top of it.\n\nDAY 40, Mars Base Dragon:\n\nToday we received an evacuation order. It came in very early in the morning, while we were all sleeping. It told us all to gather back up into the pod in which we came, and to jettison ourselves into permanent orbit until we can be received by another crew scheduled to launch 2 weeks from now. I don't know why they sent us this order so suddenly, but today has been nothing but us packing our stuff up into their crates, the rations and the suits and the computers. We spent almost 3 months getting out here, and several years of training. I feel myself grow afraid at what could have them taking us home so quickly. We set out tomorrow morning. \n\nDAY 52, Red Dragon Pod:\n\nits just me and john now. we made it to orbit but the others    the looks on their faces will always haunt me. we have the rations to remain up here in orbit,  john and i,  for several weeks   now that there is only 2 of us maybe even 5 months   \ni just wonder if i have the will power to stay up here that long with what i saw still in mind.\n\nDAY 83, Red Dragon Pod:\n\nnow i have rations for 6 months.\n\n",

Over.\"\n\nAndrews would have slapped himself if any part of his body could reach his face right now. Of course, those god-awful status report protocols! It's not like he was doing anything exerting or anything. Andrews sighed, and clicked the \"record\" and \"transmit\" buttons, located on the convenient space between his thumb and his index finger.\n\n\"Status report, Earth time 3:24 AM, December twenty-second, 2060.

End status report.\"\n\n\"Acceptable, Andrews. Continue, but for the mission's sake, remember to make your status reports! Out.\"\n\nEasy for her to say. She's just been sitting in Mission Control back at base, looking at a bunch of computer screens and going to the break room every thirty minutes to browse archived Buzzfeed articles while doing a status report about how her job is \"extremely difficult, but it's worth it to see the future of humanity up close.\"\n\n\"Future of humanity, my ass.\"\n\nAndrews had decided he had had enough rest for one Mars day.\n\n\"Alright, continuing climb. Over.\"\n\n\"Acknowledged. Out.\"\n\nAndrews, absent-mindedly continuing to climb, didn\u2019t realize that he had touched something cylindrical and metal, jutting out of the cliff. When he used it as a handhold to reach a higher rock, the metal began to slide out of the cliff. Andrews didn't realize that his handhold had given way until he was 25 feet down, falling.\n\n\"Oof. Damn it. Control, I'm--\"\n\nAndrews cut himself off when he realized that his long-range transmitter had broken his fall. He wasn't in contact with Control or any of the other surveyors.\n\n\"Well...\" Andrews continued, fully aware he was talking to nobody, \"I *could* walk all the way back to base and scrap all this perfectly good data, or I could *not do that.*\"\n\n\n\nAndrews decided to continue. \n\nTurning around, back to the cliff face, he noticed something odd and slightly disturbing.\n\nPart of it was opening.\n\nAs the door at the bottom of the cliff face opened, some of the rocks began giving way, crumbling and falling down the cliff. Andrews noticed something at the very top of the cliff lose its foundation and come falling down towards him. He stepped aside to avoid the uniform cylinder of metal. It almost looked like...\n\n*a flagpole.*\n\nThe piece of cloth that was attached had been covered in the trademark red dust that covered the planet. Andrews, wiping off the dust, noticed that the cloth underneath was also red. A hammer and sickle was emblazoned on it. It was a Soviet flag. \n\n\"What the hell is a Soviet flag doing on Mars? Did one of the surveyors bring it as a joke? No, this flag looks... older.\"\n\nThe door opened fully.\n\nAndrews stepped into a tiny room which he recognized as an airlock. He should have expected that the door would close behind him and the room would refill with air.\n\n\"Damn it all. I guess I'll have to wait to get back to base. Although...

Like, really old. It's so rusty that no amount of cleaning could make it work again. It's World War Two era at least.\"\n\nThe Russian, realizing that she had no way to use violence to solve his problems, nor was that the way to solve them, threw away the gun.\n\n\"\u042d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044e\u043c\u0435 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0444\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0421\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0428\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 . \u0412\u044b \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446, \u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e?\"\n\nAndrews understood exactly one word in that sentence.

Good. Take me to it.\"\n\nThe Russian led Andrews along a narrow passage into a massive room full of machinery, which Andrews recognized, after a moment, as computers from the late 1990s. Reminded him of one of Dahlia's old Buzzfeed articles. \"Only 90s Kids will get this!\" Joke's on you, Buzzfeed. The 90s kids are in their 60s now.\n\nThe Russian, typing furiously on one of the keyboards, brought up some translation software.\n\n\"Thank you.\" said Andrews.\n\n\"\u0412\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b , \u043f\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c.\"\n\n\"My.... name is...

Type it.\"\n\n After thirty minutes of elaborate translation and retranslation, the overall story, as Andrews had heard it, was that in the 90s, her great-grandfather as well as several others had arrived on Mars. After the Soviet Union collapsed, they realized that they were the last true Soviets and decide that a true colony needed to be established, with farms and a self-sustaining ecosystem. So they grew their food in Mars dirt and lived off of the slightly malnourished vegetables that resulted, for 50 years, until one left on an expedition and never returned. Another left to find them, and they never came back either. One by one, they all left and never returned, until it was only Alexandrina.\n\nAndrews, who was so absorbed in learning the story behind this place, hadn't realized that the other surveyors were probably panicking because he hadn't radioed in.\n\n\"Do.. you... have a... long-range transmitter.... I could use?\"\n\nAlexandrina led him to the storage room, in which was stowed years' worth of potatoes and leeks, and one of exactly what he was looking for. Plugging in into his suit, he turned it to the correct channel and pressed the \"transmit\" button.\n\n\"This is Michael Andrews. It looks like we have a new addition to the crew.\"\n\nThis is my first time doing one of these.",

            "comment": "The ear-to-ear grins the Astronauts wore just moments ago were replaced by emotionlessness. Though they had become accustomed to the unnatural silence of space, the four Astronauts now felt a silence of a different kind. Not the kind on a still morning on the beach, where Ross had once stared at the stars and dreamt of the ones he'd visit. Not the silence of the backseats of cars, where Derek had fallen asleep during the family trips to New York. Surely not the silence that fell upon the room Chris and Corey sat in while they told their Mother about the upcoming mission to Mars. No, this was a silence of both time and place, no thoughts or thinking was being done. How could it? \nThe Red Four, as they were called, had just landed on Mars for the first time in human history and to the applause of millions on earth. People were lighting fireworks, drinking and celebrating a monumental human achievement without realizing that what we had achieved had been achieved before. \nRoss broke the silence\n\"How?\"\nA typical three letter question paralyzed a group of doctorate-holding astrophysicists. \n\"How does no one know about this?\" \nHe inquired again, again to deaf ears. \nCorey took a few limp steps forward, extended his bright white glove and felt a familiar fabric. The clothes he was used to were all made of a certain fiber, one that was sure not to deteriorate in high pressure. This felt familiar though, earthly on a place that should have never had contact with earth. \nIt was cloth, red cloth. Redder than the sand they stood on.  \n\"Soviets\" Corey muttered. \nThey all knew. The hammer and sickle were about as recognizable as mickey mouse to a bunch of military veterans. It was the universal sign of evil and oppression, but they handn't the slightest clue of how it beat them there. Or why, even the Russians, were celebrating their successful landing. \n\n\"They kept it a secret\" ....Chris finally broke his silence. \"But why?\" \n\nThe ship they rode in for the last nine months was a beautiful shade of silver. Painted beautifully with American flags and the NASA logo. It stood 40 feet high and towered over the men, giving them shade as they trained with it in the hot summer. The fifth crew member, as they called it, was the mighty ship. And although they could not decide on one name, the various titles it held all were significant to its pilots and its journey. And it was gone. \n\n",

            "comment": "&gt; \"Do we tell them?\"\n\nI stared. I stared at the only thing different for miles. In a frozen wasteland of boulders and dirt, it's not hard to stand out. \n\n&gt; \"Unbelievable.\"\n\nAs I clambered up the mountainside my mind flashed back to grammar school. The United States and the Soviet Union had been at war for the better part of half a century, a conflict spanning across continents, politics, economics, science, ideology, and space. \n\nThat and apparently planets.\n\nI stared. It wasn't hard to make out the 'ole hammer and sickle. A relic from a war that tore my country apart. I felt the material through my gloves, it had held up well through years of storms. I dropped my parcel and dropped back.\n\n&gt; \"Kim, blow it.\"\n\nBefore my eyes an unheralded accomplishment of mankind, one that took us nearly a century longer to achieve, was incinerated in an instant. I began my ascent for the second time.\n\nDamn, this was a good spot. The cosmonaut who picked it knew his stuff.\n\nAs I fixed my charge to the ground, I remembered how I'd dreamt of this moment. Setting the red, white, and blue colors to be displayed for all to see, I thought I'd be proud of what we'd achieved. If only we had been first.\n\nI thumbed my radio to address the world that awaited me back on Earth. I held the bitterness on my tongue.\n\n&gt; \"Supreme Leader, we have made the first step for man on Mars.\"",

            "comment": "Jesus fuck eight months. Eight months in this tin. Years of training. A lifetime of dreams, and eight months in this tin, and in the next 30 minutes it will all be worth it. We'll finally reach our destination. Finally see first hand how red this planet really is. I can't explain how im feeling. I feel light, I feel almost careless, but at the same time uneasy. I don't know. My arms are numb. Like i'm not getting enough blood. I flex, everythings working, I just feel off. 10 minutes, and I'm down there. 10 minutes, and my team and I have achieved more than practically any human in existence. 10 minutes and i'm first. 10 minutes and i'm infamous. My god the journey. The pain the saddness the love. I don't need to do much for the landing. It's mostly in Alex's hands. I watch myself make a fist. It's time we land on this frigid, irresolute, and magnificent planet. Jesus fuck. \n\n46 hours and I don't feel like stopping. I don't know what it is. It could be that as a 170 pound man, I weigh 68 pounds on this planet. It could be that my fucking heart hasn't slowed down since we made that rocky landing. Whatever it is, We are fucking cruising. So far there has been nothing of interest. We picked up a few rocks, checked the dirt, but haven't run into any big headed green fucks with ray guns. Haven't seen any jacked blue dudes floating around in an glass palace. Just sands and rock, and to be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way. \n\nWe received new coordinates. Going to see if we can find any stage of water. Where there is water, there is life. If we could find just one microbe, we'd be accredited with the biggest discovery, perhaps in human history. Jesus I can't believe we made it this far. We cruise over a cliff, closing in on the coordinates. up above I see a shimmer. No fucking way. We arrive. The shimmer is ICE! Jesus fuck! How long has this been here?  This is, this is.This is God. While others look for the slightest chance of life, I decide to see how far this bad boy goes. My god this is beautiful. For being so narrow the ice goes farther than I thought. From where we started it looks like it runs up hill. I reach it's end, and something catches my eye in the distance. Red like the planet, but motionless. What the fuck is that doing here? I get closer to make sure, because there is no way. THERE IS NO WAY. finally my nightmare is realized. I can make out the sickle and the hammer. How? When? We were supposed to be first. We were supposed to be the best, if they beat us, why the fuck didn't they say something? I get close enough to touch the flag. it's cut up. Why on earth wouldn't they tell the world. They won. They beat us... I turn around to head back to my group. I don't feel so light anymore. I talk over the conjoined mics. \n\"Guys.\"\n\"Will, Get the fuck out of there!\" Alex shouts. \nWhat? I see my team start to run away from me. What did they... All the sudden a shadow encompasses my walking path. I watch the rest of my team sprint down hill. The shadow goes wider and wider. Jesus fuck. \n\n \n",

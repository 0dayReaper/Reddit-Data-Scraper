            "comment": "Honestly, I always liked the idea of being like my father, he took care of me, my sis and my lil bro. The man raised us three into great people, I always wanted to be like my dad. Sadly, life wasn\u2019t that kind to me, in the words of the doctor as I had a check up on my health\u2026\n\n\u201cThere is no shame in it sir, some people just weren\u2019t made to have children\u201d \n\nI know the man didn\u2019t meant anything bad with that, but well, nothing I could do, nothing bad with being sterile\u2026. Nothing bad with that\u2026\n\nMy coworkers in the office found out about it, some joke about it, some others just said sorry. One, one decided it would be fun to give me a mug that said \u201c#1 Dad\u201d I wanted to throw the mug and break it in pieces. But I didn\u2019t, no, I simply left it in my desk and took it with me back to my apartment.\n\nI did my routine of everyday, work, cook, rest, and visit the kid in the park. You see I often visited a kid in the park who I played chess against. Kid you not, he is better than any of my coworkers. Kid knows how to play chess, I\u2019m still not sure how it happened. We just started to play a game in the park, I set the chess board and he sat against me. A couple of hours later we decided we would play every day.\n\nI don\u2019t know what pulled me to play with the kid, but in a way, I saw my lil bro in the kid. Robert had always been one to play board games against me, but different from Robert this kid could make me bite the dust. And that is how every day after work I would play with Alex on the park and buy something for him to eat. \n\nI was sure the kid was living on the streets, I didn\u2019t have any idea of how he survived, I don\u2019t think I could keep it up like him. Maybe that\u2019s what made me push the subject and offer to adopt him about three months after our first contact. \n\nThe day the coffee mugs started to show the number in ranking of the fathers all around the news were excited to look for the #1 Dad, who could that guy be? My mug changed that\u2019s for sure. It didn\u2019t show a ranking number, in something totally different, mine got white. The porcelain white mug didn\u2019t have anything written in it. Not that I care though\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to class dad\u201d \n\n\u201cBe careful out there Alex\u201d \n\nThe hug of the kid made me feel like the number one dad. Some people aren\u2019t made to have children, but everyone can be a father. Hope you are proud dad, I\u2019m just like you.",

            "comment": "The kids bullied my daughter because of me. This I already knew. I was the reason Angie came home with timid steps and snuck off to her room without saying hi.\n\nI made a fist as the soft patter of her footsteps disappeared down the hall. Kids were cruel and life even crueler. Angie had done nothing to deserve a father like me. I had been born completely blind and with my balding head, my pendulum cane, and sunglasses worn even at night, I made for quite the spectacle\u2014one that Angie paid for everyday in her middle-school classroom.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your dad?\u201d they would ask her. \u201cWhy does he walk so funny?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with him!\u201d she would snap back and in her frustration, they found weakness.\n\n\u201c*My* dad doesn\u2019t need a cane to walk. *My* dad doesn\u2019t wear sunglasses at night. *My* dad isn\u2019t blind!\u201d\n\nMy phone buzzed in rapid secession three times. It was time for work. I pushed myself out of my seat and grabbed my cane. I paused as I passed Angie\u2019s room.\n\n\u201cHey, honey,\u201d I tried. \u201cI\u2019m going off to work now, everything okay today at school?\u201d\n\nNo response. I couldn\u2019t even hear the sound of her breaths. She didn\u2019t want to talk.\n\nI offered her a smile which she wouldn't be able to see, but I hoped it sounded through my words. \u201cI love you Ange, I\u2019ll see you in the morning. Sleep tight.\u201d\n\nAnd then I left. A dad who not only got her daughter bullied in school, but ran off to work when her daughter needed him the most. But who else would pay the bills? And was that really a good enough excuse to abandon my little girl? Tears welled up in my useless eyes as I started my cane in its rhythmic pendulum swing.\n\n---\n\nI worked security at a small law firm. People would think that being at the front desk would require some sort of sight, but I recognized every voice that came into the building and I could hear people\u2019s lies through the tremble of their breaths. The other lawyers joked that I was like a drug dog for lies.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Aaron said, his footsteps approaching. \u201cYou get one of these yet?\u201d\n\nI glanced up at his voice. \u201cLet me see.\u201d\n\nHe let out a small chuckle and held it toward me. I grabbed it and realized that it was a mug. I felt around its smooth edges and frowned.\n\n\u201cA mug? I already have one,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s a *World\u2019s Greatest Dad* mug. It shows your ranking in terms of being a good dad.\u201d\n\nI felt the edge again. Still nothing. \u201cHey, congrats on being the world\u2019s greatest dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Aaron\u2019s voice inflected up. He was on the verge of laughing again. \u201cMe? The best? Yeah right. I was lucky to be in the top 50% which isn\u2019t that hard considering that some dads are in jail.\u201d\n\nI gave Aaron a smile. \u201cCongrats on above-average then.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks. Let me see if I can get you one, you got yourself a little girl, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said, but Aaron wasn\u2019t the giving type. He was the competitive type and I knew all he wanted was to see someone ranked lower than himself. \n\nSo let\u2019s compare the blind dad to every other dad in the world. I\u2019d be lucky to hit average.\n\n---\n\nThe mug was coming in the mail. An extended holiday weekend meant I had five days before it got here and in that time, I had to hit number one. If people were making fun of Angie because of her dad, then I\u2019d just have to prove that her dad was the best.\n\nMy phone buzzed again, this time twice. It was time to go home. In three hours, Angie would wake up for school and I had to be ready by then.\n\n---\n\n\u201cDad? You\u2019re still awake?\u201d Angie asked and yawned.\n\n\u201cYeah, got home early from work so I slept earlier.\u201d I said, which of course, was a lie. I hadn\u2019t slept at all. \u201cTake a seat, breakfast is almost ready.\u201d\n\nI listened for the sizzle and pop of the bacon. It was getting close.\n\n\u201cWhat is this? Are we celebrating something?\u201d\n\nI always woke up for breakfast with Angie but that was usually a time for toast and conversation. Now I had diced fruit, fluffy pancakes, and an assortment of toast and jelly options splayed out on the table.\n\n\u201cNothing in particular,\u201d I told her. \u201cHey, after school, why don\u2019t we go that new amusement park that opened up? You\u2019ve been wanting to go haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Angie said, caution in her voice. \u201cBut last I checked, we\u2019re still poor.\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201cI found the money. I\u2019ll pick you up after school and we can walk to a bus stop together.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, dad.\u201d Though she was still wary, no nine-year old girl would pass up a day at the amusement park.\n\nI nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d and I could feel her rolling her eyes.\n\nShe was right though, we *were* still poor. But all that meant was I had to start working the mornings as well as the nights. I could find an hour and two in between to sleep and the rest of the time would be either on the clock or with Angie.\n\nThere were zoos to see, aquariums to wander, clothes to buy, and through it all, I had to make sure that Angie was having the time of her life.\n\nI took a small breath and turned off the stove. \u201cBacon\u2019s ready. Dig in.\u201d\n\n---\n\n---\n\nAngie held the mug in her lap. It was wrapped in cheap paper. Her dad sat on the couch, watching her, listening for her breaths.\n\nThe past five days had been strange to say the least. Every day was a new adventure. The first day was at an amusement park where her dad had even let her buy Dipping Dots. She had bought an extra-large serving. The second day was at the zoo where her dad had bought whatever animal feed she had asked for. So she had fed half the animals in the petting zoo. On the third day, he had offered for her to swim with the dolphins. She wanted to, but told him no. Money didn't grow from trees and even if it did, she was too short and him too blind to reach it.\n\nThat day, he had fallen asleep on the bus, mid-conversation. And in his sleep, his breaths had become labored and his smile dropped. It took so much tugging to wake him up that they almost missed their stop.\n\nShe had been having the time of her life, but it didn\u2019t seem the same with her dad. And though he sled and exclaimed and laughed, she could hear it in the wilt of his words and the small strained breaths he took when he didn\u2019t think she was in earshot. After all, she was almost as good a lie detector as he. And he was beyond tired.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it say?\u201d he asked her. \u201cIs it a good number?\u201d\n\nAngie swallowed and unwrapped the mug. She had a suspicion what this was about. Her dad always blamed himself for the bullying. He had always thought if only he weren\u2019t blind, everything would be okay and sometimes, even Angie believed that.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t true. Her dad wasn\u2019t the reason kids were mean.\n\nThe ceramic felt cool to touch. She looked at the words. Her eyes widened and a swell of air caught in her throat.\n\n\u201cDad,\u201d she nearly whispered. \u201cYou made number one!\u201d\n\nHer father let loose a single exhausted breath. \u201cGood,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNow the other kids won\u2019t be able to make fun of you anymore.\u201d His words waned and his eyes closed as he slowly drifted to sleep.\n\nAngie held the mug in her hand, rubbing her thumb along its surface. It was completely smooth. \n\nShe ran off and found a permanent marker and crossed out the *10233*. In its place she wrote *1*. \n\n---\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang for 2+ stories a day, continuations by popular demand, and more!\n",

Apple products are all accessible to blind people, deaf people, and otherwise disabled people out of the box, so I prefer them. I also have a MacBook pro, circa 2012, with a disk drive built in just in case I get given books on disc.\n\nI generally just tap and flick, sort of like how sighted people use their smart phones or laptops with trackpads.\n\nI have a braille display. The one I have, I believe, retails for about $10k or $5k but I forget which, a friend sent it to me. It has 20 Braille cells, track wheels to move around the screen, and some cursor routing buttons. It's super basic, most modern ones have a Perkins keyboard, which is like 10 keys that can be used together to type Braille, input commands, and otherwise use the display. With it, instead of listening to speech that could be mispronouncing things, I can read the Braille which changes as I go up and down lines.\n\nI'm waiting impatiently for a $500 Braille display/note taker to come out, but it's been delayed and no new information about a release date has been forthcoming.\n\nFor reference, the braille display used in the Netflix Daredevil series, which auto-routes aka scrolls to the next line when you run your finger past the end of the line, can cost tens of thousands of dollars.",

It has audio description, basically someone talking in the silences to clarify visual stuff going on on the screen.\n\nThat specific feature, assuming he didn't actually scroll in a different way, ie flicking on the phone or buttons, is specific to a certain line of displays. All in all, across every display that is out there, I believe there's only like 5 brands that make them, and they each have 1-5 lines, from what I know.\n\nApple has coded emojis to read, so the basic ones like the shower, taco, cheese wedge, all read as I typed. Facial expressions are different, like the \"I'm tired of your bullshit\" went from being called a tired face to persevering face. In iOS 10, there was an option added so you could hear \"emoji\" after every emoji, like \"Face with tears of joy emoji\" but considering people use like 5+ emojis in a row, it's worth it for me just to assume that they're emojis.\n\nAs far as poetry, which I assume is what your last question is about, I don't look for it but I can enjoy reading it. I personally don't write poetry except for haikus. I actually really enjoy them, although my New England accent can make them challenging because some words get extra or lose beats with my accent.",

            "comment": "Most families that live in the Summit Meadows neighborhood chose the suburban paradise for its fair weather and peaceful ambiance. It's currently ranked the fourth most ideal place in America to raise a family, as chosen by Consumer Report magazine, which states, \u201cthe suburban quiet is broken only by the sounds of bicycles, birds and the occasional lawnmower.\u201d\n\nBut on July 18th,  exactly one month after the Great Un-mugging, the cul-de-sac in Summit Meadows was alive and buzzing.\n\nThe children of 1134, 1136, and 1148 Meadow Drive \u2013 seven heads in all \u2013 gathered together at the grass island enclosed by the pavement circle, each child trying their best to shout over their peers.\n\nJacob was the oldest, the tallest, and also the loudest, which made him the ringleader by default. Eventually the arguing subsided, order was established, and then he was able to hold court.\n\n\u201cMe and Sophia snuck into the Baker house last night,\u201d he announced. \u201cWe saw the mug. Tom's dad is at number three now.\u201d\n\n\u201cProve it,\u201d Jennifer said, a small freckled girl with a shock of red hair tumbling out of a ponytail. \u201cWhere's the mug? You did take it...didn't you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was gonna, but Sophia got scared. Thought we would get in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn't fraid of getting in trouble!\u201d said Sophia. \u201cI was just sayin we wasn't no thieves, that's all.\u201d\n\nA shiny silver SUV turned onto the street and drove towards the group of children standing at the dead-end. The group turned to study the car, waiting for it to come into view.\n\n\u201cThat's Tom and his dad now,\u201d Jacob said, as it neared. \u201cEveryone shut up and act normal. Anyone rats on me and you're dead.\u201d\n\nThe SUV pulled into the drive of 1132 Meadow Drive and the engine died. There was a slam of doors and Tom and his father emerged from the car. \n\n\u201cHey-ya kids,\u201d Tom's dad said, loosening his tie. \u201cWhat are you rascals up to today? Hopefully not getting into any trouble this time. Mrs. Dobinsky still hasn't let me off the hook for letting you lot dig up her flower bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cN-no sir, of course not,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cWe was just thinking of trying to get a game of street hockey organized.\u201d\n\nTom's father smiled. \u201cSounds like fun. Tom and I have to have a talk first, but then he should be able to join you.\u201d He winked. \u201cYou can pick him last if you want, he won't mind.\u201d\n\nTom was already heading into the house, doing his best to avoid eye-contact with both his father and the rest of the group. \n\nThe group of children waited dutifully until the front door slammed behind the father-son duo before speaking. Jennifer craned her neck, checking that they were gone, then took the risk.\n\n\u201cHe hasn't been around for weeks, now all of a sudden he's number three,\u201d she breathed. \u201cIf that's true, then that means...\u201d\n\n\u201cHe jumped up almost ten slots,\u201d Jacob said, finishing everyone's thoughts. \n\n\u201cWhat does it even mean to be the number one dad?\u201d Sophia asked. \u201cEveryone just says its that the coolest, nicest, richest dad is number one. But ain't nobody knows what they judging them on. It could be anything, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever it measures, Tom's dad is gonna be number one in it soon,\u201d Jacob said.\n\nJust then there was a shout from inside 1132 Meadow Drive and the door sprang open. \u201cI hate you!\u201d Tom screamed, wiping tears from his eyes. He bolted across the lawn and down the street, disappearing into the shimmering haze of the July heat.\n\nTom's father flew out the door after him. \u201cTom, come back! Will you just let me explain-\u201d He trailed off, aware that the eyes of the entire neighborhood were still on him.\n\n\u201cSorry you had to see that guys,\u201d he said. \u201cIce cream on me later if you promise not to tell Mrs. Baker about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jacob said, hesitating, then, \u201cIs Tom okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he's just a little upset with his old man. You can't blame the little guy, we all have make tough decisions. This big jerk of a father,\u201d -he pointed both thumbs at himself- \u201cjust announced he has to leave on *another* business trip, had an urgent conference come up in Miami. I get his point, that I'm never home, but hey, sometimes you have to make sacrifices for the greater good.\u201d\n\nHe began to stride down the road after his son. As he did so, something fell out of his pocket; a piece of paper, fluttering in the wind down towards the group of children. Jacob ran over and snagged it out of the breeze.\n\n\u201cSir you dropped your-\u201d he trailed off, realizing Mr. Baker could no longer hear him.\n\nJacob looked down at the paper, still warm from a printer. There was a black and white photograph of a man he did not recognize, wearing a dark suit and black glasses. The photograph was captioned,\n\n&gt; Name: Gary Temples\n\n&gt; Rank: 2\n\n&gt; Location: 17 Cherry Ln, Miami, FL\n\n* * * \n\n/r/ghost_write_the_whip",

            "comment": "Bryce Morrison thought he had it all: a loving wife, a charming son, and a satisfying job. Yet there was something that nagged at him - a constant feeling that he wasn't good enough.\n\nOn The Day of the Mugs, his suspicions appeared to be confirmed. \"#598,432 Dad.\" The jarring bold words remained seared in his memory throughout the day, clouding every action and every word.\n\nAfter work, Bryce returned to an empty house. Marie was out for dinner with friends and Billy had soccer practice. Perhaps a few hours of SportsCenter would help ease his mind. But alas, there came a sudden knock at the door.\n\n\"Hey there, bud!\" \n\nBryce opened the door to discover Tom Gilbert, a fellow father from across the street. He clutched a mug in his hand that read \"#49,534 Dad.\"\n\n\"I was just wonderin' if you had any interest in a nice homemade hamburger. We've got some leftovers from the cookout.\"\n\nBryce narrowed his eyes. \"Actually, I was thinking of cooking a bit myself. Mind if I drop by?\"\n\nTom took a sip of his drink and lifted an eyebrow. \"Uhhh...sure. By all means.\"\n\nBryce ran back to the kitchen and pulled a fresh ground beef patty out of a refrigerator drawer. He bolted across the street, dropped the patty on Tom's grill, and started to cook it. *This'll be the best damn burger ever made,* he thought. *I'll show that smug bastard.*\n\nIt was, by all accounts, a pretty damn good burger. Tom took a bite and gave him the thumbs up. \n\n***\n\nThe next morning, Bryce's mug read \"#432,726.\"\n\nNot good enough.\n\nBryce asked to take his vacation early, left a note for the family, and began searching for every potential dad in the county. He went to small businesses, office buildings, parks and parking lots, challenging anyone that would listen. He fixed motors, went fly fishing, played 30 rounds of golf and showed impeccable taste in microbreweries.\n\nAs the week progressed, his rank continued to climb. But at a certain point - roughly 200,000 - it plateaued.\n\nFor a moment, Bryce was tempted to smash the mug, right then and there. He tried some more Dad Tasks - refurbishing a porch, buying a new polo wardrobe - but nothing worked. The rank plummeted, and soon it was back in the range of 500,000.\n\nBryce drove home, dejected. He'd been texting Marie throughout the week, but she didn't seem to understand the nature of his quest. Then again, how could she?\n\nHis wife and son embraced him the moment he stepped inside. \n\n\"Daddy, I missed you!\" Billy cried, dropping his Lego truck to the ground. Marie looked understandably irritated but kissed him on the cheek nonetheless.\n\nBryce sighed. \"I just couldn't stand it. I never thought I was a good dad, and that mug proved it.\"\n\nMarie chuckled and shook her head. \"What's a number got to do with anything?\"\n\nBilly hugged his father's leg. \"I love you no matter what, Daddy!\"\n\nBryce smiled and patted him on the head.\n\nOver the next few days, the rank on the mug slowly began to climb again, but it sat dormant in a kitchen cabinet. Within a week, Bryce forgot it had ever existed. \n\n*I might not be perfect,* he decided. *But I'm good enough.*\n\n***\n\nThanks for reading!

            "comment": "George couldn't understand it. His mom was overjoyed about his father's father ranking, and how abruptly it jumped, and how much higher it jumped. When everyone found out about the mugs, some people bragged, others hid their mugs. His father woke up late on the day of the change, so he didn't have a chance to do anything to stop people from seeing his ranking... and it was a pretty low ranking. Everyone was so confused with it- John was a perfectly good father to George, and everyone agreed. His low ranking made no sense, and most people didn't understand it, which caused people to wonder about how well John treated George. Because of this, George had been getting a lot of strange looks recently and some fairly personal and embarrassing questions. His neighbor, an elderly widow named Mrs. Wilson, had actually stopped him in his driveway on the way to school to ask him one of these said questions. With a look of concern, she stopped George and like all people who have personal questions do, beat around the bush for awhile, and much to George's and Mrs. Wilson's own surprise, she abruptly spouted out, \"Has John ever beaten you?\" George's face immediately became mortified, out of hurt and surprise that someone would even think to ask that question. Mrs. Wilson, upon seeing this expression, of course assumed she was right, no matter what the boy said next. She would be sure to recall later to her video chat knitting circle how teary-eyed the boy became upon asking this question, and how she always suspected John was actually a horrible person (\"You never see him at church, either! What can you expect from someone who doesn't respect God?\" Coming from the oldest in their circle, a pig-eyed women who believed all people who didn't go to church were always busy with the Devil's work). George of course told the widow how good of a father John was, and that he had never lain a finger on him in anger, but the old women had already decided she understood, reassuring him that her door would always be open to him. Expecting a far better day to follow, George took off down the street to catch his bus. His expectations died too swiftly upon seeing his friends on the bus, who went silent when they saw him. The rest of his day followed the same pattern. \n\nJohn had seemed to be avoid the world in the days following the Mug Mishap, always looking extremely guilty to George. George was angry with him, but didn't understand it. He couldn't stand to address it directly and talk to his dad. \n\nSeveral days before John's mug showed a leap in ranking, John became much more active then he had been since the rankings came out, he went out and started buying toys for a child that was much younger then George. George knew this, because he searched the bags his father brought home. His father then disappeared on a trip for a few days, and during this time his ranking skyrocketed. George grew so excited that he bragged that his father was going to bring him home a great new gift. But when he got home- this was when George became confused. John didn't bring him anything, but seemed far more relieved then how he was before he left. He also now seemed to have a hard time making eye contact with George. Everyone seemed so much more happy, and proud of John that no one inquired what he did on his trip. His Mom even reassured George that it was probably nothing related, and that the proper ratings had just come through while he was away. George anger simmered, because he knew something wasn't right. John started taking more trips, and each time his rating went up. George didn't understand, he saw less and less of John and felt John had become a worse dad. Finally one day after John got back from his trip and George found a picture of a little boy with a note on the back- \"You left when he was so young, but he still remembered you. He's so happy to have his father back- and so am I. XO, love Ruby\". He showed it to his mom, and he had never seen her go so pale. George's Mom had a massive fight that night with John, and when George got up the next morning, John was gone. \n\nGeorge only saw John again when he came to collect his things, and George's mother refused to let them talk to each other. \n\nMonths later, George's Mom found John's old mug, left behind. The mug now looked like how it did the day it was bought- it now said #1 Dad on it. \nShe smashed the mug on the floor. ",

            "comment": "Word had quickly spread through the country about the bizarre mug changes. A whole host of dads were waking up to vindication or disappointment as the numbers of their mugs changed from #1 to some indiscriminately high number. Those who placed in the low hundred thousands were those few dads who had always seemed stable; good job, good marriage, wonderful kids.\n\nTom had only heard the news about the mug when he was at work, so he was thrilled with anticipation to read his own mug when he arrived home. With 2 little ones and a 5 year long marriage, he was expecting a good number; not the best number of course, he certainly wasn't perfect, but a good number. Maybe even enough to beat William from across the street who takes his kids out to the fair twice a month. \n\nSneaking out of work an hour early, he drove quickly before rushing straight to the kitchen upon arrival home. He reached up to open the mug cupboard where his mug from last Father's Day resided. He recognized the font, and his stomach swelled as he read the writing:\n\"# N/A Dad\"",

Very nicely done.   \n:D I was just beginning to try to think of using the same sort of idea while scrolling down; 'N/A' is much better than my idea of having a dad confused about having '#0 Dad' on his mug: \"*what does it mean, -is that higher that #1, or does it mean I'm the worst?*\", and handing it to his 'childless' best friend to look at it, and seeing it change immediately to an arbitrary large number.

            "comment": "&gt; #489,231,337\n\nRobert Johnson wasn't a very good dad. He'd drink, and he'd smoke, and when he was tired he would grumble at his kids. He didn't play catch. He didn't play video games. He mostly sat around and got fat after working at the mill. His wife, Leslie, would ask him to mow the lawn and he'd yell at her. His kids would run up the stairs while playing and he'd yell at them. At work, he'd grumble and yell at the new guy more than most. He was just an unpleasant person.\n\nHis mug's number changing didn't really help matters. He always knew it was bullshit, but it never really dawned on him how low he ranked. \"Christ almighty\" he thought, there's only 320 million people in this fucking country.\n\nSo the morning after it changed he was brushing his teeth, and staring back at him was a balding, dumpy, unshaved, slobby man in a stained a-shirt.\n\n\"When the fuck did I grow so much back hair?\"\n\nThe hot water of the shower was a poor comfort. As usual, the family was still asleep when he left the house. He resolved to fix things.\n\nSo that afternoon he got off work. He had been grumpy but he wasn't a complete waste. He did his job. So he got off and fixed himself up to get some gifts. He went to Toys R Us and bought a few lego sets for his son and some Barbie Dolls for his daughter. He went to the Florist and bought some flowers for his wife. He even went to the barber and got his hair cut into something respectable.\n\nThen he got home early. He tried to greet his wife with a kiss and flowers when she got home, but she laughed. His son took the lego sets and muttered \"thanks dad\" before dashing upstairs. His daughter glared at him over the Barbie Doll and asked why she didn't get legos too.\n\nSighing, he sat back down in his chair to watch TV.\n\nA few weeks went by. He asked his son to play catch.\n\n\"No thanks dad, I'm going over to Tommy's house.\"\n\nHe asked his daughter if she wanted to go for a walk.\n\n\"No thanks dad, I'm going over to Cassie's place.\"\n\nHe asked his wife if she wanted to get dinner.\n\n\"What are you, stupid? I have to pick Bobby up from Tommy's house and Jeannie up from Cassie's?\"\n\nSighing, he sat back down in his chair to watch TV.\n\nThe next morning he looked at the mug. That same, long number wrapped around the outside. Saturday. \n\nHe asked his wife if he could help her. He couldn't. He asked his son and daughter to play, they wouldn't. So he sat back down in his chair to watch TV.\n\nMonths went by. He bought gift after gift, flowers, toys, you name it. He asked his wife out to dinner, he bought his daughter a puppy, he played catch with his son... or at least he tried to. His daughter didn't want a puppy. His son didn't want to play catch. His wife wasn't interested in him.\n\nSo each night he sighed, then sat back down in his chair to watch TV.\n\nFinally, it was Christmas Eve. He lay awake, worrying about the latest round of gifts he had bought, when suddenly he heard a thunk on the roof.\n\n\"What the fuck?\"\n\nThe thunk was followed by a few others, resolving into footsteps. A muffled crash was heard downstairs.\n\n\"Could it be?\"\n\nHe got up, bewildered, and made his way downstairs. There, in the kitchen, were two masked figures. They all stood stunned for a second, before Robert bellowed and charged in.\n\nHe wasn't sure how it happened, but he had a kitchen knife in his hand. One was on the ground bleeding, the other was fighting. They struggled. Robert got cut, deep, in his neck, but he fought on. He was grabbing an ankle, struggling around the floor. The table was knocked over. Chaos. His vision was dark, but in the dim light he saw something; the mug.\n\nHe grabbed it, slamming it into the assailant's face until it broke.\n\nHe lay there on the floor, bleeding in the dark. The lights turned on and his wife screamed.\n\nA thin piece of shattered porcelain lay directly in his view. As his eyes darkened and the world grew bleary he saw it change from #4892 to #489 to #48 to #4 to #1.",

As his eyes fell upon the mug sloshing whiskey all over his bed, he realized instead of \"#1 Dad\" like it had said 4 years before, when Grammy had gotten it for her son, instead... That was too many digits for Jamie to even try to guess how high the number was.\n\n\"N-No sir... I don't know why it says that.\" Jamie squeaked out, barely able to make a sound with the meaty hand still on his throat.\n\n\"You know you're lucky, right? Your whore of a mom just walked the fuck out because she didn't want a little fucking brat like you. You know that, right?\" Bill squeezed again, releasing his son after the boy nodded. \"If I find out you had anything to do with this, it'll be another month in the punishment hole.\"\n\n\"Y-y-yes, so-sir. the terrified boy managed.\n\n\"Go the fuck back to sleep, and don't piss yourself or you're doing the laundry.\"\n\nWith a slam of the door, Bill shuffled drunkenly back to the couch, and flipped from the crap porno to the news, a rerun from when he had been asleep.\n\n\"Well, John, it looks like all mugs that once said #1 Dad now show their real ranking. It appears that even just painting #1 Dad onto a mug forces it to change into the proper number.\"\n\nThe last noise Jamie heard before he sobbed himself to sleep was his fathers yelling, and a ceramic mug exploding upon hitting his bedroom door.\n",

            "comment": "\"Dad?\"\n\n\"Dad are you ok?\" \n\nI stood there speechless for what felt like forever. Up until this moment my life had been what most would call perfect. A loving, caring wife. An adoring son. The irony that the gift from his last Father's Day that brought joy to my heart is now the source of this terrible anguish. \n\nMy wife and I have been together for 13 years, and for the most part we've had a wonderful relationship. The spark is still alive and well, but early on we went through a really rough patch. I was working a ton of late nights, she felt neglected and the spark was fading. She decided to go stay with her mother for a while, we didn't talk for almost a month. Well that was all the wake up call I needed. \n\nIt took a lot of work but we began \"dating\" each other again and found that groove again. In fact, things were the best they'd ever been. It wasn't long after Ethan was born. She had some complications during labor and the doctors thought we might actually lose both of them, but the good man upstairs was gracious, and they both pulled through. I'm a blessed man, and I thank my lucky stars every day for them, and do everything I can to show my appreciation to them in as many ways as possible. \n\nSo when I got a text this morning about this stuff with the \"#1 Dad\" mugs actually displaying a true ranking didn't really have me that worried, but standing here now I can honestly say that I didn't see this coming. Each word cutting deeper than the last.. \"You Are Not The Father.\"",

Frankly, she couldn't remember the last time he picked her up from school at all and now he had shown everyday this week. And to top it off, there he was, sitting in the front row of her play.\n\nYou see, Carly's father was a high powered lawyer. He made sure that Carly and her mother were well taken care of, but his singular focus had resulted in divorce and a distinct form of absentee parenting. For her dad, the next big case was always his immediate aim, while maintaining his 5.0 rating on Martindale-Hubbell was his mission statement. \n\nAnd now that had changed. Here he was, driving her home for his weekend instead of telling her to use the credit card he gave to pay for an Uber. And now all the small-talk. \"How was school? She knew he would pay for college right? Does she have a boyfriend? Did she need a dress for prom\"?\n\nNone of this would prepare her for the new CR-V parked in the driveway. It was time that she had her own car he said. Nothing too fancy, but something safe and practical.\n\nThis was weird. Carly should have been happy. But she wasn't. It all felt wrong and forced. So that night, after her dad went to sleep (after watching television with her, something that hadn't happened for at least 5 years), Carly walked around the house and tried to make sense of her dad. She was honestly concerned that he was sick, maybe it was cancer. Maybe this is his chance to make everything right before he left.\n\nBut she didn't find anything. No doctors notes, no medical correspondence, nothing out of the ordinary. Her dads house was immaculate. He loved to display his trophies from his high school wrestling days, all of the articles with his picture from the law firm, and he even had a custom-built electronic sign that listed his gamer score on the Xbox.\n\nNo, she wasn't likely to find anything here. If he was dying, he would keep that from her. And he wouldn't leave the papers out. \n\nThere was a mug sitting out though. It looked like the #1 Dad mug she bought him a couple of years ago, but it had \"# 5,478,888 Dad\" on it. Carly thought that that was a weird gag gift for someone to get him. Still, he had been so nice, she figured she'd put it away for him.\n\nThe next morning the news broke that all of the mugs had changed. It was then that Carly realize that her dad was addicted to winning.",

            "comment": "Adam sipped out of his favourite mug during his lunch break. His hands shook as he brought the hot beverage to his lips. Grease from his hands made its way onto the surface of the cup, tainting its perfect yellow surface. His back ached in the same spot that it had for years. It had never quite felt right. He remembered the years back, when it hadn't bothered him so much. When he would come home and could hoist little Jennifer up and carry her around the house while he made supper.\n\nThe divorce had been hard on him. He hadn't fought it. His first thought had been for her. For Jennifer. He gave up his house, that he had paid off both mortgages for. One when he bought it, and the other when he had to refinance, after losing his job. Tough times call for tough decisions. His old pickup had been sold during the court proceedings. He still remembered when his dad had given him the keys after they spent 4 summers restoring it. He had just graduated high school.\n\nHe glanced up at the clock. A little habit of his. It wasn't necessary. He always looked up at the same time. 3:15 am. 15 minutes left on lunch. \n\nWhen he took the job at the factory, he knew the hours would be long. The shifts were poor, and the conditions were less than ideal on a good day. He silently wondered how Jennifers day would go. She was in her last year of high school.  Soon she would be going to college. He wondered where she would go. There was no doubt that she would get accepted wherever she applied in Adam's mind. She was always good at school. The last time he had been able to see her was years ago. That had slipped by him in the court proceedings.\n\nAs the last of the coffee went down his throat, he pulled the phone from his right pocket. Its screen was cracked and it had clear tape holding the back of it together. Silently, his fingers navigated to the banking app he kept on his home screen.\n\nAccounts.\n\nChequing.\n\nBalance. $243.67.\n\nHe saw the support payment. -$1800, had been taken already this month. \n\nTransfer.\n\nChequing --&gt; College fund. -$100.\n\nNew Balance. $16,567.73\n\nHe closed his phone and put his mug back into his locker. The words #1 dad reflected back at him. Her last gift. \n\nHe walked slowly onto the work floor.\n\n",

It's got words on it, suddenly.\"\n\n\"W-w-w-w-\" said Joe.\n\n----\n\nBert sat on the edge of his bed, the late morning sun giving him a headache. He stared at the mug in his hands, at the words \"World's #1382018297 Dad\". The last digits were flickering, upwards, downwards as he stared. So, it hadn't been just the beer. His hangover pounded in his brain, seemingly in time with the spinning digits. His phone rang. He ignored it until it stopped, and kept just staring at the ever changing number on the mug\n\nFinally, he spoke out loud to nobody. \n\n\"I don't even have kids!\" \n\n----\n\nHe skipped the pub that evening, and woke up clear-minded on a Monday morning. It felt really weird. He quickly donned his uniform, microwaved a burrito, and almost as an afterthought, stuffed his world's #13-something dad into his backpack. Rushing to the bus stop, he noticed the sky was darker than usual. Six stops, seven, eight, then he hoisted his backpack, tagged off the bus and sprinted to the workshop. \n\n\"Sorry I'm late!\"\n\nThe supervisor looked up from the desk in the corner. \"Bert?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry!\"\n\n\"For being late? Your shift doesn't start for another hour.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It's only 7 o'clock.\"\n\nBert stood, stunned, while this information sank in.\n\n\"Look, it's great you're here, just clock in. Half the crew's called in today, I'll need you to do overtime anyway, since you're here. It's this bloody mug thing.\"\n\n\"Mug thing?\" said Bert.\n\n\"Yeah, don't you read the papers? Lucky you and I don't have kids, but it looks like we'll have to pick up everyone's slack for today.\"\n\nBert glanced towards his backpack. \"Yeah, lucky. No kids,\" he said, flatly. \n\n----\n\nPete pulled up a seat next to Bert at the diner.\n\n\"Whatcha got there?\" He said, then \"Oh, my God.\"\n\nBert tried to hide the mug inside his jacket, but it was obvious Pete had already seen it.\n\n\"I thought you didn't have kids?\" Pete inquired.\n\n\"I....\" Bert began. *I don't. I don't kave kids.... do I?*\n\n\"Let's see it,\" said Pete. Bert hesitantly drew it out. He could see Pete reading the number, counting the digits. \"Huh.\"\n\n\"That's good, right?\" said Bert. \"A hundred and thirty four million?\"\n\n\"I don't think that's 134 million,\" said Pete, counting the digits again. \"It's 1.34 billion, Bert.\"\n\nPete frowned sadly, then after a pause, \"Still, that's good, right? There's seven million... I mean billion people in the world, after all.\"\n\n\"They aren't all dads, Bert.\"\n\nBert frowned and moved his lips, as he tried to divide seven billion by two. \"So, one something out of three and... a half?\"\n\n\"Not all men are dads, Bert.\"\n\nBert looked at the mug. Pete looked at Bert. Bert blinked and a tear fell. He wiped it away in embarrassed anger. Pete put his hand on Bert's arm. \"You have to find him, Bert. Him or her.\"\n\n*World's #1347710810 Dad* read the text on the mug. As Bert looked, and another tear rolled down his cheek, the 134 dropped to 133, then 132, then slowly to 131... \n\n\"Yeah,\" he whispered.\n\n----\n\nThe bus station was crowded. Here, a newspaper stand boasted a headline \"Jackdaw County's Best Dad!\" with a smiling face holding up a mug with a really small number. There, a young man and woman sobbing in the arms of an old man. Bert looked at his own mug, frowned, left the ticket queue he was in, and started making his way to the back of the next.\n\nHe'd called his supervisor and spent fifteen minutes being chewed out. Now he was here. He joined the end of the queue, and glanced at the mug. World's number 1066281104 dad. He frowned and left that queue and skipped to the end of the yet another. This time, when he glanced at the mug, he felt a thrill as he saw the number spinning down, down, past a billion, past 900 million, eventually settling on a number in the high eight hundred millions.\n\nHis head was so light, it seemed almost no time at all that he was asking the clerk to suggest destinations, checking each suggestion against his mug, and emptying his wallet to pay for a ticket.\n\nNow the bus was pulling onto the highway. He stared at the mug, orange sunbeams striking the tears and the smile on his face.\n\n----\n\nThe doorbell rang. World's number 202,179,553 mum switched off the faucet, and sighed, watching the suds quietly fizzing in the sink. \n\nShe sighed again, and called \"Coming!\"\n\nShe was going to be late for work. Again. Her boss wouldn't fire her this time, though, too many people were taking time off as it was. She would tell whoever was at the door to leave, wait to be sure they had, then get her son in the car. Hopefully he'd gotten his school clothes on by himself this time.\n\nShe inserted the chain latch, unbolted the door, and ....\n\nThe unkempt man outside saw her face, and gasped slightly. He looked unshaven, his clothes wrinkled as if he'd slept in them. He smelled slightly. \n\nHe seemed very familiar.\n\n\"Bertrand?\" she asked.\n\n\"Lorraine?\"\n\n\"What... what are you doing here?\"\n\nThe man opened his mouth to speak, but stopped. The skin around his eyes turned red, as if he was going to cry. \"I...\"\n\n\"Is that really you, Bertrand? What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I... I got a mug.\"\n\nHe pulled a dirty beer glass from within his jacket, and showed her.\n\n\"World's five ... \", she counted the digits to be sure. \"number five hundred million dad?\"\n\nBert's tears flowed then. Lorraine watched him sob, sob and sob and sob, watched his tears trickle and his nose go runny. She had no idea what to do or say.\n\nA small voice spoke behind her, \"Mum, who's at the door?\"\n",

What is the truth behind the sudden alteration of mugs all over the world? Do they really reflect the rankings of dads? We'll be checking in with spiritualist Dave Connor and skeptic Alfred Hanny as they discuss the matter at 5-\"\n\n*click*\n\n\"...he throws, and... touchdown!\"\n\nMark hangs his head after the prison guard changed the channel on the TV. Out of the corner of his eye, Mark saw Davidson, a man convicted for killing his wife, hit the payphone against the wall, and started yelling, \"Don't fuck with me Vincent! There not even 60 million dads in the world, how I be number 60 million and some bullshit? You think I'm some fuckin' shit dad? It's not my fuckin' fault I'm here, can't take care of Marissa...\"\n\nA guard responded to the commotion and after several hand gestures signalling Davidson to get off the phone, the guard pressed down the hook. Davidson immediately punched the guard in the face. Several guards from around the area ran towards him, and tackled Davidson to the ground. \n\nA man laughed as he sat down next to Mark, \"Wow, man. Hey, I bet you have a bigger number than him, ya know?\" The man taunted Mark, \"What's it been for you, 30 years? For killing your little girl. And your wife just magically got dead too, but they don't charge you for that.\"\n\nMark silently stands up, and walks away.\n\n\"Come on baby, don't act like that! Let's say you suck my dick and make up for how rude you're being right now to yo shugga daddy,\" the man said while following close behind, grabbing his own crotch. He spit at Mark, and then laughed.\n\nAnother man, burly with a thick, curly black beard, stared down Mark as he passed by. He jumped at Mark to try to scare him, but Mark was unfazed. When he didn't get a reaction, he grabbed Mark by the crotch and squeezed. The man smiled, his mouth full of silver caps and missing teeth. Mark flinched, but refused to retaliate. The burly man leaned in and said, \"You'll fuck up before you get out of here tomorrow, and when you do, you're mine.\"\n\nA guard rushed over and pushed the man off of Mark. He never shifted his gaze from Mark's eyes. He lifted his hands into the air while the guard pushed his forearm into his massive chest to get him back.\n\nMark returned to his cell and laid down. The setting sun shined through the inch-wide slit they call a window in this place. Mark closed his eyes early today.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe next day, Mark was waiting at the gate leading to the outside with the clothes on which he hadn't seen for 30 years. It was back then he was standing on the opposite side of the gate looking in. The sound of the gate opening startled Mark, who was barely standing after his restless night. \n\nFive steps forward and he was free. Four, three... two... one more. He took his final step from the prison grounds, but the look on his face was not the look of a free man. A taxi cab honked to get Mark's attention. He looked up, squinting under the summer sun. He stepped in.\n\n\"Where to, Freeman,\" the driver asked. Mark handed him an address on a piece of paper, and fell back into his seat, gazing out the window. Then his eyes wandered to the front of the taxi where he could see a picture of a small dark-skinned girl posted on the dashboard, and then Mark looked at the cup holder to see a mug that read \"#38,384 dad\".\n\n45 minutes later, Mark handed a credit card to the cab driver to pay his fare, signed his receipt and got out of the car. \"Enjoy your freedom Mark!\" \n\nThere Mark stood, in front of a storage unit which held all of his belongings from 30 years ago, the only things he had left in the world. He pulled up the large metal door, which squeaked, and stuck. Cobwebs blanketed the numerous boxes and other belongings. Mark brushed away the webs with his hand to make a path.\n\nHe knelt down and opened a box with old electronics. He tossed the box to the side, and opened the next box. He found his old gun. It still had a round in it.\n\nMark set the gun down on a worn and dusty coffee table nearby, and continued rummaging. He found a picture frame. He dusted it off to show his wife and daughter laughing and smiling together. Mark stared at it. His movements became slower and more forced as he set the picture down and picked up a mug from the bottom of the box.\n\nHe turned the mug around to see the engraving. It still read \"#1 Dad\". A tear strolled from his cheek, and mixed with the dust on the mug. The tear stopped abruptly, cradled by the engraving of the number. His head fell, and he rested his hand on the edge of the table beside him.",

            "comment": "The day was turning to evening Thomas observed when he glanced through the window. He turned back towards the computer screen and stared at it with bleary eyes. \n\nThomas had been running his family lumber mill ever since his father had passed away many years ago, may he rest in peace. He wondered briefly what number his dad would've gotten if he had been around for the Reveal. He didn't reckon that the late belt nights would've earned him any extra points.\n\nHis mind wandered away to how the world had changed after the Reveal. It was a testament to the shallowness of mankind, with self-help books with titles \"How I went from nine digits to four\", reality show like \"America's next top dad\", and all these smug TV personalities that had gone from being ordinary people to being self-proclaimed gurus. Many of these \"gurus\" wouldn't dare to touch a mug today though. They might have been great guys back in the day, but their rankings had corrupted them. There was one instance with the narcissistic Donny Drumpf who claimed he was number one, and was gonna prove what a tremendous dad he was by grabbing a mug on live tv. The guy reckoned that if he created his own mug it wouldn't change the number. Brilliant, except that he underestimated the power of the mug gods (Yes, since no one knows how it all happened, we now have people worshipping the mug gods, or rather \"The Almughty\"), and instead he showed the world what a total mughole he was. It even resulted in investigations to the current world population, as the ranking had been such a high number.\n\nThere had been a lot of speculation on who was #1. According to North Korea it was Kim Jong Un, no surprise there. That was only one of a dozen claims. Thomas let his eyes wander to his own mug. It was a classic #1 Dad mug, with the addition of a child's writing that said \"Forever the best dad, Sara\". \nThe rating on the cup said #1.\n\nThomas smiled. He turned off his computer, packed his stuff, locked up the office and headed to his car. He drove to the town's florist to get Sara som lilies. She had always loved them.\n\nOnce he had paid for them, he got back into the car and drove to a small park. He entered the park and sat down on his knees.\n\n\"Hey honey, sorry for being late, hectic day at work today\" he said as he organised the lilies on the ground.\n\nOpposite him was a tombstone. It read:\n\n\"In loving memory of Sara, our #1 girl\".",

My Keurig and no one in a fifteen mile radius noticed, as they were instantly ripped into the basic building blocks of life, which were then ripped into their smallest components and shrunk down to the size of the void where my mug sat. Within two minutes the entire East Coast was gone. By 6:05am in what had been Eastern Standard Time (before the East Coast disappeared) the entire Earth was gone. As I watched in horror from the view port of the International Space Station, my colleague who had brought his #1 Dad mug with him at the request of his children never noticed. He was too enthralled with why the number on his mug has jumped from 1 to 7,986,922 then gradually back to 1 to notice his impending doom.",

He had to sell the house, lost his job. But at least now he was trying. He could see the world again. \n\nMichael took up a third job for a little extra money, a cleaner. Working late nights after places close up. It wasn't great, but it was what he had to do. One night his company sent him to a dentist's office for a job. Starting in the consulting rooms and then the waiting room, the finished up in the staff kitchen. Getting to work on the dishes, he picked up a mug\n\n\"#864,372 Dad? What kind of stupid mug is that to buy for someone?\" Not thinking anything else of it, he headed back to the one bedroom apartment he called home. \n\nIt was 3am when Michael got home. Heading straight for the kitchen, he boiled the kettle and made himself a cup of tea. It was always this time he would get emotional, the nights were the hardest. Never managing to completely suppress his tears. \n\nHe returned to the living room to sit in the dim light of the side lamp. Stifling a sob at the memories. Then the creak of sound as the door to the bedroom opened. \n\n\"Dad?\" \n\n\"Hey Son, sorry I didn't mean to wake you.\" Michael replied as he wiped the tears from his face. \"I thought I'd be home earlier tonight, but I have tomorrow night off so I promise I'll make your game\". \n\n\"Don't worry about it Dad, I know you're trying for both of us. I miss her too.\" \n\nTaking his son into his arms and planting a kiss on his cheek, Michael told the boy that he loves him and sent him off to bed. He then picked up the photo he has of the three of them on the coffee table, before placing it back down next to his mug of slowly cooling tea. Reading \"#1 Dad\". \n\n\n-----------\n\nThis was my first ever attempt at writing anything like, ever. Don't be too mean! ",

            "comment": "I sat in the kitchen seat, knowing that i was getting a mug this father's day. My kids seemed so excited after the phenomenon started. I felt honored as i was being given my official ranking. Although they were already 4 and 5 respectively, i knew i hadn't been a dad long and figured i wouldn't place high.\n\nThe kids swarmed in with their little wrapped box and thrust it toward me. My wife, behind my children,  smiled just as big as them. As i took hold of the box all thought turned to statistics. Did they include ALL dads or just the ones with mugs? What exactly is the measurement? Just how many dads are out there? Why are my palms sweating? Many more questions popped into my head but they were quelled by my wife snapping me back to reality telling me to open it. \n\nCarefully pulling the bow strings, i undid that which held what only now i feared the most. Slowly i lifted the lid to reveal a large white mug. Taking it out of the box i turned it to see a large hand painted \"#1 dad\" on the side. I know it's not one of the official mugs but rather one which my kids made themselves. Crying, i embraced them both telling them that no matter what my true ranking was, i was so happy just to be their dad and that they were the most wonderful things in the world. After they left the room to go play my wife sat down at the table with me.\n\nAsking me what i thought of their gift, i responded by saying there was no need to have the knowledge as, to the children, i already was #1. I then got up and made a cup of covfefe in my new mug. Turning back to sit back down i saw my wife already had a cup of her own. She turned it toward me. I could not believe what i saw. There, in her hands, was a mug which said #1 dad. It wasn't painted, it didn't have a smudge, it showed clearly #1. Taken aback i just stood there staring at my wife who had an even bigger smile than when i was given what was in my hands. \n\nI still don't know what i did, but i swore that i would always and forever try to be the best dad i could be. No matter what my mug says, i promised i would strive to be better than i am. That is how i found out that i was the best dad in the world. ",

            "comment": "Already almost 400 comments, this is going to be buried, but, well, I try. Do not forgive my errors, since I'm not a native speaker. Grammar Police is welcomed.\n\n-----\n\nWilliam had always liked children. One of the best miracle of Nature, difficult to describe. Wonderful.\n\nHe came back from work, making a mental note to not forget to give the evening daily hug to his sweety at home, Helene. His daughter, 5, waited with a present, a mug. The mug was one of those having those cheerful but overused sentences \"To my dad, you are the number 1\".\n\nAfter the hug, the little one said to him \"Daddy, this is for you!\". He gave her another hug, a kiss and put the mug over the kitchen table, to use it directly the next morning.\n\nThe next morning the mug showed another number. \"To my day, you are the number 583,745,382\" . He questioned Helene, trying to be as careful as possible: \"Did I do something wrong? All ok between us?\". After a bit of talking in the family, with Helene denying any problem and receiving some more hugs and kisses, William left home for work.\n\nShortly after arriving at work, checking briefly online communities, he got to know about the \"mug problem\". It seemed that \"my father is #1\" mugs around the world would report the ranking, among fathers, of the owner if the owner was a father. No one knew how the ranking worked, who decided them and how was possible that a mug could change its paint pattern.\n\nWilliam, still skeptical, pondered the situation.\n\n\"Assuming that this mug ranking is somehow true. I'm behind the 583 millionth position. How many dads are out there?\". An approximated computation showed that around 1.2 billion dads were out of there. So he was more or less in the middle of the rankings.\n\nHe did not care to be the first of all fathers, or to be in the top 1000. He cared just to be not bad. He knew that providing a proper upbringing to a child is complicated and trying to follow arbitrary ideas of perfection would make thing worse. Nevertheless if this ranking was true, he was doing a mediocre job. Maybe not bad, but neither good, even though he put a lot of care, love and effort in the relationship with his daughter. \n\nDays passed. While still unexplained by science, the rankings on the mugs started to influence society. More and more stories by the media were done. Celebrations for the top 100 dads in the world were made monthly. Endless discussions were made about \"why a father has such poor ranking\" on the TV, news, social media and other channels. Also the police and the social services started to check the rankings to uncover possible child abuse or suspicious people that happened to have a family.\n\nReligions claimed the rankings be work of (this or that) God and started to point out certain behaviors as example of \"high ranking fathers\" and therefore \"appreciated by God\".\n\nIn all this, William had the same ranking, more or less. He was living in a developed country, having an head start over hundreds of millions of other dads in terms of resources and possibilties, still his ranking was not as good as expected. To be in the middle of the expected population of \"1st world dads\" he should have been around the 150 millionth position. Therefore he was doing even worse than his possibilities allowed. \n\nWith social pressure mounting, he started to question himself. Was he really so needed by his family? He started to say \"I'm sorry\" to his daughter. His wife slowly started to worry, but he denied any problem.\n\nOne day he phoned home, saying that he was going to be late.\n\nIn the empty office, he looked through the window. 32nd floor, pretty high. Cars or pedestrian looked really tiny from that height. He could just transfer his savings to his wife and help to leave the family in a better situation. He was bringing them down, with his mediocrity. He couldn't figure out what was wrong with him. He was just trying to be lovely. Success for him was not a large bank account, he would be super happy to be able to give his daughter proper values to let her never feel inadequate in this world. That would be success. Improving the society of a tiny bit, through whatever way, that was his ideal of success.\n\nBut the ranking on the mug seemed not to approve that. It seemed to say \"you may have nice intent, but you are failing\". If his wife would have found someone else, that men would likely have a better ranking of his.\n\nTears started to flow, when he opened the window. Then his phone rang. His home. *sigh* William decided to pick up the call.\n\n\"Daddy! I cannot wait much more, soon I'll have to go to the bed. Where is my evening hug?\" \"Sure honey, my bad. You will get two hugs tomorrow as compensation and one this evening. I... I was thinking and it took more time than expected, I'm coming, wait for me\".\n\nOn the way home he thought \"how will my daughter accept that I left her behind? She will always ask why, why I left her. I cannot do this. I may be a failure, but I'll be there, whatever it cost.\"\n\nAt home, he brought his daughter in bed. He read her a story. His daughter asked \"Dad, have you cried?\". \"Yes honey, I was thinking about you, you are so wonderful, I'm lucky.\" and then, after a pause, \"I'm so sorry.\" \n\nThe next day William saw his daughter giving his mug back. \"Mommy helped me\" said Helene. The mug was covered with labels, one could not read the number behind those anymore. \"To **my** dad, the only one that I have. My number 1\".\n\nSuper happy for the morning, William checked the news in the launch break, as a lot people argued online to be the best dad in the world, showing their mug as proof.",

Nothing was stopping these kids from bragging about their wonderful fathers.\n\nAn eight-year old with blonde pigtails sat quietly in the corner of the room, pretending to read her book. Lisa knew fully well she couldn't join the endless chatter of her classmates. No matter how happy her Dad made her feel, his mug's number will never change. \n\nFirst off, all mugs in their home were plain, with no writings on them. \n\nSecond, she was *adopted*.\n\nThe Great Mug Revelation's rules were clear. Technicalities, more like. *The mug should have a written #1 Dad on it. The Dad must be a biological father*. \n\nThe bell rang, interrupting her thoughts, followed by hundreds of kids running towards the gates, their enthused fathers waiting for them. It was all \"*Dad you're still the best for me!!!*\", or \"*Wow, Pops, you ranked so high!*\" with an occasional \"*You could do better, Dad.*\" \n\nHer Dad wasn't there. With a heavy heart, she ran home.\n\n-------\n-------\n\n\"How's school?\" Terrence Andrews greeted his daughter when she got home. He had just finished preparing dinner for the family.\n\nLisa walked past him, not saying a word. *This must be about the Great Mug Revelation*, he thought despondently to himself. The rules of the Revelation were announced a month ago on TV to give fathers all around the world to prepare. There was a little excitement at first, but when the technicalities were stated, Terrence looked at his daughter, tears forming in her eyes. \n\nLisa knew she was adopted since she was six. \n\nThe young girl promptly threw all printed mugs the next day.\n\n-------\n-------\n\nUsing a Sharpie, Lisa scribbled on the blank white mugs she got from the cupboard. She wanted to write * #1 DAD IN THE WHOLE WHOLE WIDE WORLD*, but she knew it wouldn't be right. Somewhere, around the world, a father would be holding a mug whose writing didn't change, basking in pride. *The true #1 Dad*.\n\nThen, as if a bulb appeared above her head, her face glowed with a smile. She was about to write a number she was sure that no mug in the world stated. \n\nHer father found her sitting on the kitchen table, a marker and a mug in hand.\n\n\"Lisa, dear, what are you doing?\" Terrence asked the little girl. \n\nWhen Lisa was done, she gave her Dad the scribbled mug. For a moment, his face was scrunched up, trying to give meaning to the number written on the mug. Then realization dawns. Terrence gave her daughter a tight, warm hug, and said \"Clever girl.\" He chuckled, his little girl in his arms \"I love, love, love you so much.\"\n\n-------\n-------\n\n\"She waited two hours for your goodnight kiss, you know,\" Terrence was on the table, sipping a late-night cocoa. \n\n\"I know, I know,\" the man wearing a suit reached high for the coffee mix, his agile hands stretched out. \"I didn't expect the traffic, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Terrence pointed to his mug. \"That wonderful daughter of ours,\" he said with a grin.\n\nLucas Andrews looked at his mug, with \"* #0.5 Dad*\" marked in his daughter's neat handwriting. He gave Terrence a lighthearted smile. \"It's a tie, isn't it?\"\n\n",

I had read about the fuss in the papers and heard about dads trying to get their ranking up.  some with success some without.\n\nThe big search was on for number 1, a reward was on offer from several large media groups.  We as a family wanted nothing to do with it so we all vowed to keep it a secret.\n\nProblems began when a friend dropped by, he asked what my rank was and I lied.  Told him I didn't have a cup.  It was the biggest lie a dad could tell these days.\n\nHe was taking the whole thing seriously because he was down in the tens of millions but was also not well off so like everyone he was looking to find number 1 and get the reward.\n\nTrouble was it wasn't just the mugs, it was spreading to T shirts, bumper stickers, you had to be so careful not to be outed.\n\nWe ended up moving away, to a remote place where we could be safe.\n\nWe heard on the radio that the wars are spreading worldwide. \n\nWe are safe...for now.\n\n",

            "comment": "\"I just don't get it,\" i called over my shoulder, Dad was sitting in the kitchen by the little TV. \"How is my ranking so much higher than yours, You were a great Dad to me.\"\n\nI started the Dryer, 5 minutes, i might have to open it early but it should be fine, it'll be warm enough by the time the show ends.\n\n\"There isn't that much difference, they found a #2,294,537,898. It's massive the d and the last 8 overlap each other. I would find that hilarious if there wasn't a kid involved in there somewhere.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean, I learned everything about being a father from you, how are we that different...\" I trailed off as i heard another commercial break start. after those 2 more minutes of Show for the \"next time\" &amp; tv would be done. Gotta be ready on time.\n\nHe was quiet for a while, that's where I got it from. During college Dad studied Native American history. He learned that many tribes didn't trust a man who wasn't comfortable thinking silently before he spoke. It's part of what made both of us good speakers, a pause that wasn't verbalized with a 'Like', 'Err', or 'Umm' carried more weight.\n\n\"It's part of what you learned that I taught you on accident that accounts for the gap. I remember saying on more than one occasion Do as I say not as I do, You don't do that, cause you did as I said and made it a habit. Also, with what your brother did...\"\n\n\"Hold on a sec,\" I didn't interrupt my father often &amp; he knew it was important when i did. I had heard the closing song begin and i wanted to keep the schedule as tight as possible. Routine was comfortable to him. Sure enough he was standing in front of the Dryer when I got there.\n\n\"There you are Thomas, it's time for your bath.\" I Opened the Dryer &amp; pulled out a child size Bathrobe and two towels. The robe was very warm and the towels would still be when he got out. \"The water is already ran, be careful getting in and I will be up shortly to help you with your hair.\" Thomas nodded and trotted off towards the stairs. Dad had just moved back into the area after he retired and Thomas wasn't comfortable around him yet. I turned behind me to walk back &amp; found Dad standing between the kitchen and the laundry room.\n\n\"That's why, You've been dealt a hard hand in parenting, Son. You were easy, and i thought your brother was too. Turns out i just wasn't paying enough attention. But you, Your daughter starts college this year, and with that spectrum thing Thomas has; I don't really understand what's going on but I  can see how hard it is.\" He took a deep breath, steadying himself for whatever he was going to say next.\n\n\"I know you were down at the prison last week...\"\n\n\"Dad, he's still my Broth...\"\n\n\"Now let me finish. You went down there for Justin's birthday in spite of what he did to your eldest. You helped Lilly move past that, and once she did you forgave him.\" His Eyes had begun to mist over, but he continued. It seemed to me that he had been preparing this speech for long time. Since even before the number changed.\n\n\"Me, I haven't seen him in 14 years. Can't even stand to look at the family pictures with him in them. That why the difference. That's why I'm so proud of you. I Look at my #19,864 and i KNOW, that it's all because of you.\" He was crying now, Tears streaking through the oil from his project car and into the beard he grew after he retired.\n\n\"You've got a lot to handle. Home schooling Thomas, your wife always at the office working on the next case. But I see all your family has been through. I look up at that Mug of yours and I can tell you that Thomas, Angela, Lilly, Me, and even that Fuckhead brother of yours would disagree with #364. You're number one, and you always have been.\" \n\n\"I love you too, Dad.\" I almost couldn't bring myself to forge into that silence. It was too profound, but i had to get upstairs to keep an eye on Thomas. Best to get it over with, like with pulling off a band-aid, just like Dad used to say.\n\n \"By the way, I got us Baseball Tickets. Rubber Ducks; I don't know how Thomas would handle a big MLB game, but I wanted him to experience something like what We all did when I was younger.\"\n\n\"I'd like that Jr. I'll stop over early and we can work out driving plans.\" He turned to leave but stopped short.\n\n\"See, that's what I was talking about,\" he said pointing at the mugs on the shelf. \"Yours says #359 now, I brag all the time about your dad mug. I gotta go, want to get home before it gets too dark.\"\n\n\"Sure, Friday will be fun, just like old times. Lock the door on your way out, will ya.\" I said smiling, Dad tossed a wave over his shoulder as he walked out, He didn't see it, but his rank had gone up too. Just like i knew it would.",

This seems neither a godly medium or act till you are confronted by The Work. Then realisation dawns.  You feel awe. The power you confront is complete and total. Ultimate. \nThese mugs, every single one in the world, currently displayed a message \"This is how good a father you truly are\" and a number in some long-dead or never-existing language though this posed no imposition. The words hammered an understanding into your head and into the depths of your soul. The numbers were true and certain. This you knew.\n\n\n \"Job,\" whispered the Pope nervous. \"Like Job.\" \n\n\nHe bowed his head though he did not pray and he thought on God, his power and his plans, and he thought on his sins and his number #20,000,001 and thought on the sins of his flock, every single lamb, and he worried for the world.\n\n\nThe Pope began to pray and his prayers were many and strange.",

            "comment": "It was a rough morning this particular day.  Having some beers at the local pub didn't help calm the waves of frustration and tension I had to overcome the last couple years.  The patronage was meager at best, and the draft Guinness left way too much to be imagination.  I had seen families come and go, but never knew what had happened the previous day.  It was called \"hello fathers day\" and many didn't agree with it.  I myself wasn't prepared for the value of 5,627,490.  What kind of dad am I to have \"earned\" such a distinct punch to the gut?  Was I really that bad of a father?\nThe barkeep consoled my sorrow with a fresh mug still foaming over as they used the wooden stick to cut to top off.\n\nHe was unusually joyful today after so many father's had learned they too were in the 5M ranks in the local area.  The news papers had photos of mugs smashed on the streets as if to protest the unusual events insignificance, whilst showing the world their arrogance and ignorance to the truth.\n\nI looked up from my freshly tasted draft and asked the barkeep why he was in such a good mood?\n\nHe replied: You see that hook above the bar where all the other mugs are?\n\nI nodded in acknowledgement.\n\nThat's my father's mug!\n\nSo? I replied. What's so special about your father?\n\nThe barkeep laughed in bewilder of my ignorance to the fact I'd never really gotten to know him, or his family.\n\nGo and get it down from there!\n\nFine, I must know why you're in such a good mood!\n\nI go to reach for the mug, and within an instant of turning it around the mug displayed the number 1.\n\nI was shocked to see it said \"1\".  This must be a joke barkeep!\n\nNo, not at all!  He replied.\n\nWho's you're father?\n\nThe barkeep flexed his muscles and cried out \"John Fucking Zoidberg!\"\n",

Some sobbing can be heard from down the hall.\n\nHe turns off the tv.\n\nTakes a deep breath to compose himself.\n\nAnd starts down the hall.\n\nHe knocks on Katherine's door and starts, \"Hey Kath, do you want to talk abou-\",\n\n\"I WANT TO BE ALONE FOREVER!\" she screams at him as more muffled sobs can be heard from inside her room.\n\nHe opens the door anyway, slowly, just a bit. She is lying on her bed, crying softly into her pillow. She was still wearing her heels and her hair was curled all nice like, and she was wearing her new floral dress.\n\n\"Boy troubles.\" He says under his breath with a sigh.\n\nHe sits down next to her on the bed and puts a reassuring hand on her back and says, \"Hey Kath, what happened tonight?\"\n\n\"He-, he was making out with Tammy\" she says softly. And starts another round of crying.\n\nHe attempts to calm her by giving her a small back rub and says, \"Tammy isn't even that cute, I can't believe his taste in women\".\n\n\"Dad you aren't helping!\" She cries.\n\n\"Yeah, I know, I know\" she seemed to settle down a little. \"Come here, let me cheer up my little Kat\", and he pulls her into a hug so she can cry on his shoulder.\n\n\"When I was about 10, I had this awesome Pok\u00e9mon card, it was a Typhlosion if I remember correctly, and I had treasured it, it was foil, fire type, super high attack, great heal-\"\n\n\"Dad.\" She smiled a bit.\n\n\"Sorry, ok, ok.\" And he was smiling a bit too, remembering its shine.\n\n\"It was beautiful, I didn't trade it for anything, not even for the Ancient Mew. Anyway, I put it somewhere safe. Apparently, I had put it somewhere too safe because when I went back to look at its glory again, it was gone, so suddenly it seemed. I had always thought it was there, with me, but I could never find it again. It was pretty sad, losing something like that. For a 10 year old anyway.\"\n\n\"This is a dumb story\", she was getting bored of his 10 year old life struggles.\n\n\"Tough crowd\", he laughed. \"Well, long story short, I had struggled for the next day, thinking about that card. But the very next day, my best friend had traded a shiny new Charizard card for my dumb little Pikachu. He thought Pikachu was the best Pok\u00e9mon. I never said he was smart.\" He laughed, and she was just a little confused.\n\n\"Moral of the story, I thought it was the end of the world when I lost my favorite card, but just around the corner was a very different card, yet just as valuable, maybe even more valuable than the card before it.\"\n\nHe smiled, and says, \"I uh, I hope that helps a little bit, remember that you are beautiful, both the inside and out.\"\n\n\"And that your Charizard might be closer than you think\".\n\nShe smiles and hugs him, \"Thanks Dad, that was a little weird, but I know what you meant.\" \n\n\"Thanks\".\n\nAnd with that, he gives her a warm smile, and goes back to his sports game. His favorite team had lost again, but that's ok, he knows his daughter is feeling better. \n\nHe takes a nice sip of his hot chocolate from his favorite #1 Dad mug that his daughter got him for Father's Day and relaxes with a smile, looking at a picture of his wife, the one that is in his head whenever her thinks of her nowadays.\n\nEver since she passed, he didn't think he could raise his daughter on his own but, today was definitely a victory for him, and he hopes she is thinking the same up from above.",

I decided to bring it inside, since i had known to me he had been my number one dad. \n\nWhen i touched it the number changed. I hadn't been with a girl in about a year. I hadn't dated in almost 3. I was a dad.\n\nThe number was insanely high. But i didn't know i was a father until i touched it, so i guess... that was fine. It bothered me though. I mean it would bother anyone. 698,589. It was a non-scripted kind of number. The kind you would see on a prison inmates shirt. The kind of number I felt like.\n\nI called Cristina. We had dated for 3 years, i almost popped the question, but then her grandparents died and she said she needed time to think her life over. And we just fell out of touch. She was the last girl i was with. \n\nThe conversation was pretty normal. I am good how are you, me too, thanks for asking. But like word vomit it came spilling out of my mouth like a a wet shit on a hot day. \"DID YOU GIVE BIRTH TO A CHILD OF MINE WITHOUT ME KNOWING?\" The receiver was quiet for a long time. Then you could hear her breathing on the other end in a sobbing tone. \"I had an abortion without telling you.\" I wasn't sure if it was yours, John, I cheated on you. Thats why i left. I felt to guilty.\" \n\nI knew i shouldn't but i felt relief. Not a dad here. I told her it didn't bother me and hung up after saying we should get coffee some time. She seemed stunned but i was on a mission.\n\nThe next number i called wasn't as good of a lead. Tristan was her brother. He picked up, her phone, he asked me how i was, what kind of day i was having, and if i had heard from his sister at all. Told me all about his weekend out cracking cold ones with the boys. There it was again, the bile taste, The acid. \"DID YOUR SISTER HAVE MY CHILD AND NOT TELL ME?\" He laughed as my voice cracked. then when he stopped he said, \"Maybe, I havent heard from her since you two dated.\" \n\n\"why do you have her old number?\" Oh she gave me this phone the last time we saw each other. It had her number, but i just told all her friends it was mine now, and kept it. You mean you don't know where she is?\"\n\nI couldn't answer right away. Then after a while all i could managed was, \"I'm coming over, Be ready for me.\" and hung up.",

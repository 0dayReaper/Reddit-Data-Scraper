            "comment": "The one day I need the ATM to work without issue is the one day the damn thing ate my card. Forced to go IN the bank and talk to the teller is the worst when you have to say *Your machine ate my card*.\n\nThe bank is a small building on the corner, usually it's pretty empty. I *thought* I got lucky with only having one little old lady in front of me. That was until I saw her handful of paperwork while she gave a stare of pure death at the teller serving another man. Only one booth open, and I was expecting a long wait.\n\nAs the old lady walked up to the counter, three masked men come bursting through the glass doors. I turn to see them all holding weapons. One shotgun, and two small submachine guns. Instinctively I just threw my hands in the air in sheer terror.\n\n\"Every single one of you fucks get on the ground! **Now!**\" shouted the man holding the shotgun, while the other two men straight out darted for the teller's booth.\n\nI hit the floor harder then I did falling off my bike in grade school.\n\nMy eyes are closed, my face is buried in the floor, and I'm just praying they don't ask me for my wallet because it's emp-\n\n\"Oi! Maggot! Give me your fucking wallet before I put a hole in your fucking scon'!\" he shouts as I hear him cock the shotgun.\n\nFuck. FUCK!\n\nI reach slowly around to my back pocket, and begin pulling out my wallet. Before I could reach it forward to give it to the crook, he snatches it out of my hand and opens it. He's pulling everything out like my medicare card, my royalties cards, and my library card.\n\nI hear something hit the ground and I jump. It was heavy from the sounds of it. I was too scared to open my eyes for the sake of it being the guy pointing his shotgun at me. Then I hear him muttering...\n\n\"Oh fuck... Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck\" Over and over and over he's muttering to himself.\n\n\"We're fucking dead... She'll fucking shoot us if she finds out we did this...\" he says to himself softly. He suddenly drops everything, puts something infront of my face and I hear him backing up.\n\n\"Roger, Shane, we need to leave. Now.\" he says with a quickened panic in his voice.\n\n\"Like fuck we do! This stupid cunt is opening the safe! Why are you acting like you have a gun to your head! Stop backing up, grab that shotgun and help us out you dipshit!\" shouts one of the crooks from behind the counter.\n\n\"No, you don't fucking get it. We need to go, **now!**\" he shouts. \"Forget the fucking money, drop your fucking gun, and run like it's your last fucking breath because if Taylor finds out what we did to a bank Alan Geoffries was in at the time, we'll all be wearing a pair of concrete shoes in the river before the 6 o'clock news!\" His voice has quickened as I open my eyes to my wallet closed and infront of me with all my cards nearly piled up on each other.\n\n\"Bullshit. This fucker can't be *THAT* Alan Geoffries! Not a hope in hell!\" shouts one of the crooks behind the counter, as he hurls himself back over and grabs my wallet. I shut my eyes again.\n\nSuddenly there's another loud thud, this time right near my head.\n\n\"Shane! Get a fucking move on, now! We're leaving! Leave everything here! Fucking run!\" shouts the crook next to me as I open my eyes to see my wallet infront of me again, this time next to a submachine gun. I look up and I can see what the crook is wearing clearly. Black ski mask, blue overalls. I can smell piss, and as I focus more, it's coming from the man that was just next to me, as he backed away from me with his hands up.\n\n\"We're extremely sorry, Mr. Geoffries. We meant you no harm. Please, if you would be so kind as to not report this to Miss T, we'd be in your debt for life.\" says the first crook, now standing at the door with his hands up, facing me. I lift my head up more, and the crool that was just beside me now has a large wet spot around his crouch, as he continues to back away towards the door. Did he... Did he just piss himself?\n\nI look around, and just as I turn around I see the last crook leap back over the counter bare handed and sprint for the door.\n\n\"Fucking run! Move it! Get the fuck out of here now!\" he shots as he pushes through the first two crooks, who take the hit and turn and sprint out the door themselves.\n\nWhat just happened?\n\nAs I look around, the few people that were in the bank were looking at me. The old lady looked like she had her life flash before her eyes, pale and like she had seen something long forgotten. The teller still had his hands up and was looking at me as well, and a girl from behind the counter came out from the back room with her hands still in the air.\n\n*What the fuck just happened?*\n\nAfter a few minutes the police arrive and secure the area. They begin interviewing people and looking at the camera footage confirm what happened. I told the officer interviewing me what happened and asked him who Miss Taylor was.\n\n\"Queen of the underworld. No man, woman or in between has the strength to stand up to her. She's referred to as the Spider Queen. No one knows who she is or how she got her name, but every criminal in any sort of criminal network knows who she is, and the second you ask about her, everyone goes silent. People have admitted to crimes we have no proof they committed, rather then sitting there and speaking a single word about her.\"\n\nNo, it can't be. I went out with a girl called Taylor in highschool, and she was a massive spider fanatic. She loved them more then her own family and owned a King Baboon tarantula, something that was imported from Africa. There is no way that's her... I called her My Little Spider Queen because she was 5'8. No, it can't be.\n\n\"Do you know why these crims just turned tail and ran from you? We dug a little bit into your name on the way here and all we can find is reference to a \"No Harm List\" that's either some tightly kept secret, or that you're involved with them\" the sergeant asked, putting his pen and notepad down.\n\nBefore I could even reply, another police officer arrived and came straight over to us. This one was wearing what looked to be a more military based uniform. Like a suit, but definitely a police uniform. Kind of like those official ones you see on T.V.\n\n\"Sergeant Peters? I'm Commander Alex Kepler. I'm here on orders from Commissioner Davis to take Mr. Geoffries into protective custody as of this moment.\" he says as he holds out an enclosed envelope stamped \"Spider\".\n\n\"Mr. Geoffries, do you have all your belongings?\" asks the commander as he reaches out his hand for a handshake.\n\n\"I do, thanks. Can you tell me whats going on?\" I ask, responding in kind with his gesture. He guides me towards the door, without saying a word.\n\nI look around as we exit the bank and see a single black car, windows tinted as dark as the night sky. You couldn't see in even if you had halogen lights. The commander opens the door and gestures me into the car. Inside is a man in a suit, black aviator sunglasses, and an ear piece. He turns to me with a look that feels like I'm being digitally scanned.\n\n\"Please enter the vehicle, Mr. Geoffries\" says the commander. I look to him to see him sweating slightly. I nod, sit down in the car, and the door closes. Without a chance to even put on my seatbelt, the car takes off and I nearly slide along the leather seat into the man I want to call The Terminator.\n\n\"What's going on? Who are you?\" I ask, frantically stretching the seatbelt over me.\n\n\"Miss Taylor wishes to speak to you Mr. Geoffries. It would be rude to ignore her requests\" he responds. The tone of his voice almost felt like he was telling me I had no choice.\n\n\"Who is this Miss Taylor and what the fuck is going on? That's not the Taylor I think it is, is it? Taylor H-\"\n\n\"It is best you keep quiet until we arrive, Mr. Geoffries\" cutting me off in a different tone this time. I could already tell that was *Don't you say anything else you dumbass*.\n\nThe more and more that kept happening, the more and more I kept getting flashbacks about the girl I went out with in Highschool. She was a clutz, but cute. Nothing said fun more then the smile on her face when ever she was excited. There was nothing in this world that phased her.\n\nThat smile, though. He face was as smooth as a models and lips as crisp and ripe as cherries. I remember just staring at her for hours when we first got together for coffee and just listening to her go on about her pet spider Frank. I could tell you every little detail she ever mentioned about that spider solely because he enthusiasm about it was so genuine and pure, that every time she spoke, her words would just sink in and ingrain into your memory about it.\n\nI remember her silky black hair. She would spend hours after her shower, making sure her hair would remain straight for the next day. Conditioner, followed by a thorough wash, followed by a cold rinse and then finished with her straightening it and tying it into a natural bun with no hair ties before bed. When she woke up in the morning, she would tug on a bit of hair in her bun, and it would perfectly fall apart and fall down to her shoulders. Without a doubt, it still looked perfect just like she had just washed it. It was so good to watch in the morning.\n\nWe fell out of touch after we broke up at the end of highschool. I was still living with my parents and without a job, so when they moved to the countryside, I was forced to go with them. We both agreed that if we were ever to move back to the city, we would get together for coffee again and catch up. Last I heard, she moved to America to pursue a business career a little more then 11 years ago.\n\nWithout noticing the car had stopped up outside a large warehouse at the docks just outside the CBD. I started to shake a little bit out of fear as I look back at The Terminator. He looks at me, and gestures the door. I nod softly, and as I reach for the handle, the door is pulled open before me.\n\n\"Mr. Geoffries, this way please\" gestures the man who opened the door.\n_____\n*Cont. in second post*",

                    "comment": "I look towards the warehouse, and see armed guards on either side. I swallow my pride and walk over to the large doors. One of the guards lifts his hand off his weapon and touches his ear. He's says some things and then puts his hand back on his weapon. As his hand touches the weapon, the doors begin to open.\n\nI'm still walking towards the warehouse, but it now feels like my legs are going to give way. It feels like my legs are trying their hardest to run, but my brain is saying *Don't get shot* every time they do, so they quickly fall back in line for another step.\n\nAs I approach the door, the guard that touched his ear nods at me.\n\n\"Mr. Geoffries, Miss Taylor is at the back office waiting for you\" he says as he points to the back corner of the warehouse.\n\nLooking inside, I see things only boys dream of. Expensive supercars, a private jet, a table full of money and cute girls counting it in bikinis. What have I just walked into?\n\nAs I kept looking around I suddenly hear shouting in the distance. I knew that shout. I knew that shout without a second guess. It was her. It was Taylor.\n\n\"There's my Daddy Long Legs!\" I hear as I turn to see a small woman dressed in black running towards me. High heels, black silky hair tied into a bun with a chopstick holding it together. A black dress with a frilly skirt. Underneath the frills, red fabric. Before I could say anything, she had already done her signature \"Off with the cloppers\" kicks, flinging her high-heels into the distance so she could run easier bare foot, because she felt like a horse clopping around when she wears high-heels.\n\nAs she got closer I braced myself. I knew exactly what she was going to do. She leaped right at the last moment and I caught her. Her arms wrapping around my neck, and her feet wrapping around my body. She jumped with enough momentum I had to spin around to make sure neither of us fell over.\n\n\"I missed you so much! I can't believe I get to see you again!\" she shouts, squealing in pure excitement over my shoulder as she hugged on to me as if it was life or death.\n\nShe leaned back and stared at me, and then I remembered the feeling from back then. He silky smooth skin, her crisp cherry lips. I also got to see her eyes that I had forgotten about; crystal clear blue. It was hard to explain, but you look into them and it was like you were staring into a sapphire. Every time her iris would move, there was a new sparkle I had never seen before, like a sparkle from a gem on display. It was something I missed the most, but could remember because each time I looked, it was if I was staring into them for the first time.\n\nI was trying to think of what to say... *What's going on? What is all this? What the hell are you doing here?* But without thinking, I already said it.\n\n\"Hey there my Little Spider Queen, long time no see\" as I finally fell to my knees, as if all the weight in the world was lifted off my shoulders and I collapsed from exhaustion.\n\nWe sat there and stared at each other for a while. I didn't notice it, but the guards and the girls counting money were all staring at us. I didn't care, though. I was caught up in the moment so much that it felt like everything was just at ease once again.\n\n\"Sorry about not calling you for coffee. I've actually been back in town for more then a year!\" she chuckled, as I continued to stare.\n\n\"I guess I can forgive you, but only if you can tell me what's going on\" I reply.\n\nTaylor hugs me tightly again and then stands up. She reaches to me and drags me up off the ground. I stand up, but neither of us let go of each others hand.\n\n\"Well, since you can forgive me I guess I can tell you\" she smiles as she pulls me further into the warehouse.\n\n\"If you haven't heard already, I'm known as The Queen of the Underworld, The Spider Queen!\" she shouts as she uses her free hand to gesture everything in the warehouse.\n\nI look around at everything once again, and take it all in. She owns all of this. The cars, the jet, the money. Everything here is hers. But how?\n\n\"When I went to America, I met a girl who's father ran the Mafia in Boston. After a short time, he showed me the ropes of the book keeping, and I began to work for him. In 3 years I managed to make him a huge amount of money on importing and exporting weapons, drugs, and anything in between.\" she let go of my hand and skipped ahead, spinning around a few times. Her dress opened up as she spun, looking like she was a ballerina. She stopped and looked at me.\n\n\"After a while, he came to me and told me that he wants to pass the business off to me and not his daughter. She had no sense for business. I said yes, and from then on, began to expand rapidly. I began to move cars and car parts, exotic statues and paintings, anything. If it was illegal, I would sell it!\" she stood firm, with her hands on her hips.\n\nIt was happening again. The words she spoke just ingrained into me. Her excitement knew no bounds. I just stared as she twirled around slowly again.\n\n\"From there I began to operate in every country. It got to the point that I had other groups looking to join ours simply because we were so powerful. I was selling items to officials, Arab princes', I even sold statues to the Queen of England! Everyone was my customer, and in return I gained favors unbound by laws!\" she shouts as she raises her hands in the air. She stopped and turned to me.\n\n\"That's when I got a great idea last year. I used my influence to move my operation to here, Melbourne, Australia. My home city. The place where I grew up and met the man that changed my life. The man that gave me the confidence to be who I wanted to be. I decided that no matter what, you were to never be harmed, so I made a \"No Harm\" list!\" she put her hands on her hips and walked towards me.\n\nShe stood infront, looking up at me.\n\n\"I decided that the man that I love, no matter who he was with, no matter where he was in life, will never be harmed by the hands of criminals or police. I decided that no matter what, I would support him however I could\" she said, as she put her arms around me and hugged me tightly.\n\n*She did all that for me? She was protecting me from the crooks that she had control of? But why?*\n\n\"You must think I'm crazy, being the person I am and the things I do, huh?\" she buried her head into my chest, not wanting to look up at me. But she didn't once think that I wouldn't care about that.\n\n\"Why would I? All my fines suddenly disappeared. People seemed a lot nicer to me at banks, or at the social security office when I had to deal with all my medicare stuff. I applied for jobs and without a day even passing by, I got asked in for interviews, or when could I start. It was like having a guardian angel without knowing. How could I be angry about that?\" I asked.\n\nShe began to sob. I don't know why, but she was crying a little bit. I don't want her to cry. I want her to smile. I want that smile back in my life. The smile that I could stare at for hours without looking away.\n\n\"Enough about that, there's something you need to tell me\" I asked, trying to get her to look at me but she refused to.\n\n\"How's Frank?\" I asked with a cheesy grin on my face.\n\nWithout missing a beat, Taylor whipped her head up and stared me dead in the face with that smile that was so pure. The smile I missed. The smile that I could lose myself in.\n\n\"He got bigger! Wanna' see!?\" she said so joyously.\n\nBefore I could answer, she let go of me, grabbed my hand and started to drag me towards the office at the back of the warehouse.\n______\n\nI don't know how this one feels, but I really enjoyed writing it. I hope you enjoyed reading it as well.",

We didn't know you were in here!\" the shaking man in the ski mask told me.\n\n\"Honest mistake sir,\" the other bank robber yelled from the counter, \"have a nice day!\"\n\nI'd not understood then. But I did now. It corroborated a lot of events that had been happening in the past few years. Small subtle things like preferential treatment at a coffee place or how my friends kept telling me how lucky I was that I would always get the first job offer or apartment I applied for. I'd always chalked it all up to good fortune but this event. The robber calling me \"THE Warren\", meant that, to their group or at least to someone, I was important. Important enough for bank robbers to run out of the building in fear.\n\nAnd as I stood among the dressed in black, each man and woman walked past me with grieving faces. They told me how much my mother meant to them and how sorry they were. They each shared a happy moment for me to hold onto, to think about the better times. Despite the stories, I sat there. Watching the grave digger shovel more and more dirt onto her coffin. Soon there was no-one left but the gravedigger.\n\nI broke down into tears, sobbing into my palms like a little boy. I wailed and wailed thinking about all the moments I had with her, and all the moments I wouldn't. I heaved with each cry and let out what I had tried so strongly to hold in. To give the appearance of strength. But I was weak. I was helpless. I let her die. I should've pushed harder. You see she wasn't dead of old age. She didn't die in a tragic car accident. She died of Methemoglobinemia. Aniline seeping into the water pipes from a nearby factory repeatedly poisoned my mother for years.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" a voice said calmly behind me. I was startled and released my sticky hands from my face. The gravedigger was gone, the grave still only half full. I tried to recompose myself before turning around to face the voice. But when I turned I saw her. Ira. The girl I once loved. Once. We had split up right before college in a less-than-friendly fashion. I don't even remember what the fight was about, but she had struck me. It didn't really hurt physically and I tried to assure her that I could forgive it but she was distraught. She said nobody had ever made her feel that way and left.\n\nShe stood there, looking like she did the day we split up. I sat there motionless, the scent of freshly dug soil lingering in the air. She turned and walked away. And I didn't follow. \n\nAfter a few days, I wasn't even sure it happened. Perhaps it was just a stress-induced imagination? But she stayed in my mind, and with every lucky green traffic light, to fortunate parking space. Every random Samaritan paying for my meal, she came into my mind. Was she the reason I was called \"THE Warren\"?\n\nI was bent over my desk, paper scattered across the surface. Like a full blown conspiracy theorist, I had strings connecting pages and photographs on a cork board, trying to link all the people that held back the regulations to make the water safe. I had most of the links, but it was overwhelming me. There were _so_ many people involved, from government officials to safety inspectors. All of them in on it in some way. In this moment my mother would've come in with a glass of tea, patting me on the shoulder to tell me that I shouldn't work so hard. That I would work myself into an early grave. But her ghost faded away as I yearned for that pat on the shoulder. I looked up in anger and saw the photos of the men and women stuck on the board who denied me the rest of her life. \n\nI screamed. I screamed and screamed only to be interrupted by a knock on my door. Looking through the peephole, I saw \"Joe's Pizza Palace\" written on the teenager's hat.\n\n\"I have a delivery for a Mr. Warren?\" the pizza boy yelled from the other side of the door before giving it another knock. I opened the door.\n\n\"Ah Warren right?\" he asked, handing me the pizza.\n\n\"I didn't order a pizza?\" I mentioned, still taking the pizza in hand because it was a pizza and I wasn't gonna say no.\n\n\"It says right here, Warren, 25 Paper Street, pepperoni and pineapples with extra pineapples,\" he said, pointing at the receipt, \"now I won't judge you for the pineapples, everyone has their dirty little secret. Have a nice day!\" the boy said with a smile before turning and walking away.\n\n\"W-Wait, I haven't paid for this yet,\" I yelled across my front yard.\n\n\"Um,\" the boy looked back down at the receipt, \"No it says here that you paid online already,\" he yelled back as he reached his car door, the \"Joe's Pizza Palace\" car topper blocking his face. He paused and leaned to look at me again past the topper. \"Or at least, somebody did,\" he mentioned with an innocent smile before getting in the car and driving away.\n\nPepperoni and pineapples were my favorite.\n\nI walked back into my living room and placed the pizza down, opening the box expecting a message written inside. Of course there was none. Why would there be? I took a slice and walked up to the cork board of faces. I stood there chewing trying to think of my approach tomorrow. I had planned to go to the zoning official's office and get some answers. I had a rough plan about how I was gonna get in front of the man but it was still rough.\n\nLooking back down at the pizza, I tried to shake it off as crazy. But the feeling was there and any idiot could see the connections. But it was _crazy_.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" I yelled to nobody in the room, \"I am going to the zoning official's board to speak to Harold Weinbrecht about the unattended seeping of Aniline into the water supply system.\" And of course, nobody replied.\n\n---\n\nPart 2 below: https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/81n6ls/wp_during_a_bank_robbery_youre_surprised_when_the/dv48flq/",

                    "comment": "The morning was cold and crisp. My lips were cracked from the dryness of the air and my scarf draped across my face wasn't helping. I reached the zoning office first thing in the morning and was greeted with a long line at the security check. Metal detectors and x-ray scanners separated everyone from the rest of the office and at the pace everything was moving, it was probably going to take an hour before I would get in.\n\n\"He's with me,\" a man in a business suit told a security guard as he waved a card in front of the man's face and pointed at me. The guard escorted me out of the line and bypassed the security check entirely. I was confused and turned to thank the man but he didn't even come through the gate himself, simply turning and leaving the building. I walked down the hall and stopped at an intersection of signs. There were over a dozen signs pointing in different directions for this and that office.\n\n\"That way young man,\" a raspy voice said from my side. I turned to see an elderly woman with a warm smile pointing to my left.\n\n\"Oh, I'm here to see the-\"\n\n\"Yes yes, it is that way,\" she reconfirmed with a smile. \n\n\"Thanks...\" I stuttered out before she turned and started helping other people. I walked down the corridor and sure enough, \"ZONING BOARD\" was written on the doors in bold letters. I entered and found a door titled \"Mr. Weinbrecht's Office\" written on one of those sliding black name placards that you would normally find on a school's principal's office. As I was about to enter the door, a man in an extremely well fitted suit pushed past me and walked straight in. He didn't look older than 27 and as I followed him into the room, he walked straight for the secretary.\n\n\"Hey there, you're Ms. Potter right?\" he asked, leaning over her desk.\n\n\"Uh, why yes, how can I help you?\" she replied, clearly flustered by the man's good looks.\n\n\"I'm sorry, where are my manners, I'm Adam, I'm a huge fan of your work.\"\n\n\"My work?\"\n\n\"Yes, at the Parkview gallery, your art is absolutely gorgeous,\" he mentioned so casually. Even I stood still, infatuated with how smooth he was.\n\n\"Oh my, I well, it's nothing really just a hobby,\" she replied with a tinge of a southern bell accent. She had broken all eye contact at this point, her cheeks flushed red.\n\n\"Your piece titled just 'Flower vase' really spoke to me! I thought the contrast of colours were delightful. Kinda like how you are Ms. Potter, if you don't mind me sayin',\" he said with another smile. He turned to me and subtlety motioned for me to move past them.\n\n\"Oh my gosh haha,\" the secretary swooned as Adam pulled at her chin to focus on him and not me.\n\n\"Let me tell you-\" his voice trailed off as I walked into the director's office. The large man behind the desk looked up from his desk and adjusted his spectacles trying to identify me. His face looked exactly the same as the photo I had pinned up on my cork board.\n\n\"Yes? Who are you?\"\n\n\"Mr. Weinbrecht, my name is Mr. Warren, I am here to talk about zoning area R3.\"\n\n\"Well this is unprecedented. You're lucky the appointment I was going to have was cancelled this morning. You may approach me,\" he motioned towards his desk as his head turned back towards his papers. He stunk of evil and I didn't care if that was just my already negative bias of the man. I explained to him how Aniline was seeping into the water for the entire district and that lack of safety regulations lead to my mother's death. The heavy set man huffed and puffed at the end of every sentence and looked dismissive.\n\n\"Do you have any evidence that this chemical came from the factory?\"\n\n\"Well the chemical Aniline is used in rubber processing and the factory is a rubber-\"\n\n\"So you have circumstantial evidence then,\" the man dismissed. Turning his head back to his papers. \"You may leave.\"\n\nI sat there dumbfounded, a rage boiling inside me. It wasn't hard to see how this man helped kill my mother. It wasn't hard to see how this man didn't even care.\n\n\"Thank you for your time Mr. Weinbrecht,\" I said as I got up to leave. The man replied with a huff. As I walked out of his office, the secretary was still engaged in conversation with the young man. I looked the man in the eye, anger written all over my face. He returned my stare and subtlety looked back at Weinbrecht's office before looking back at me. I nodded. He nodded back and returned to his conversation with the fawning secretary.\n\nTwo days later Weinbrecht's office declared that they would begin a full investigation into the poisoning of the water supply by the chemical Aniline. Three days after that, Weinbrecht was killed in a home invasion gone wrong. He was stabbed over 40 times.\n\nI returned to my cork board and pulled Weinbrecht's photo off the wall. I took a step back and took in the whole board again. There were still so many faces left. And my anger was not sated. I would have my revenge, and Ira would be my wrath.\n\n---\n\nI'll be continuing this story on my brand new sub, /r/SupremeStories! ",

I said that exactly one time a few years ago, and I\u2019m lucky I didn\u2019t meet the same fate. She doesn\u2019t take kindly to crazy.\n\n\u201cNat, you have to quit doing this. Either kill me or let me be, please. This is getting ridiculous\u201d.  \n\u201cOh come on babe, you\u2019re still alive. They didn\u2019t even hurt you, I got here well in time.\u201d  \n\u201cMiranda and the kids have to be worried sick. They even broke a rib, come on. How am I going to explain this?\u201d    \n\u201cI can\u2019t hear shit you\u2019re saying, hang on.\u201d\n\nNat lifted the bag off my head and pulled up a chair across from me. She looked\u2026.stunning. Something about the leather jumpsuit, and the handgun leisurely held in her left hand resting on her thigh. And the icy blue eyes\u2014crisp, intelligent, and terrifying. They spoke to me when we were kids, and I fell in love with her, harshly and completely. Now, years later and worlds apart, her exterior match what they were saying.\n\n\u201cActually, hang on again. Lemme untie you too, sorry about that.\u201d\n\nShe sheepishly grinned and went behind me. I caught a brief hint of light vanilla, her regular perfume, as she cut the bonds tying my hands and feed. She\u2019d used the same thing since high school; I\u2019m glad some things don\u2019t change.\n\nNat ran a hand over my chest, \u201cthe rib isn\u2019t even broken you puss. You\u2019re bruised at best. You\u2019ve gotta sack up a bit. Finally play a contact sport or something. Don\u2019t they have intramural leagues for people like you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to kill those guys. They didn\u2019t know any better. Hell, I would\u2019ve killed me for that much money. They were just doing their jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to stop drinking, I\u2019m sorry. You know you\u2019re under my protection, right? Nobody in the whole world can harm you. Nobody in my world can touch you. Those guys touched you. So they died. You\u2019re protected.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, until you get hammered and put a kill order on me after scrolling through Facebook and get reminded that I have your number blocked.\u201d\n\nA flash of anger crossed her tired face. Talk about the Sunday scaries, right? I decided to dial it back a bit. She was probably incredibly hungover, and managed to drag herself out of bed to make sure I didn\u2019t get gutted. I softened my tone a bit.\n\n\u201cThanks for saving me, again. I\u2019ll unblock the number, that was undeserved.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. We both got up, and she hugged me. It hurt the rib a bit, but that was fine.\n\n\u201cYou know how I complained about mixed signals? Moving me from protection to kill probably confuses the hell out of people. Glad someone else feels my pain. I mean, those guys don\u2019t really anymore, but you get the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a jet for you home. I\u2019m so sorry about this, this is the last time, I promise. You won\u2019t see me again.\u201d\n\nWe broke a bit from the hug, and I could see her face. The ice in her eyes had briefly melted, creating trails down her face. This wasn\u2019t the hug of two people who would never see each other again. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time.\n\n\u201cA jet? Where the hell am I?\u201d I laughed a bit, and it broke the tension. She grinned and wiped her face.\n\n\u201cJust south of the border. Don\u2019t\u2019 worry about customs or anything, I own a few guys. I\u2019ll get you a car too when you land. You can keep the car, and I\u2019ll get a vacation for you and the family. She won\u2019t care too much if you come back with that. I\u2019ll get you some clothes too, honestly you\u2019re covered in blood and look like shit. They might\u2019ve broken your nose a bit. Sorry about that.\u201d  \nShe looked at her feet.  \n\u201cI have things I need to do today, so this is it. This really is the last time. Tell your wife I\u2019m sorry, if it comes to that.\u201d  \nWe said our goodbyes and hugged again. She sounded more convinced that time.\n\nI hope she wasn\u2019t.\n",

            "comment": "It's amazing how much people change after high school.  Chard Burkheart was the star quarterback in high school, the most popular guy in school.  Now he works at a gas station with a pot belly and no hair.  Dave Spellerman went from bullied nerd to Internet billionaire.  All that time spent on a computer really paid off for him.  \n\nAnd then there's Rosalyn \"Roz\" Churchill went from my childhood friend to my high school flame to leader of the criminal underground.  That one was definitely a curveball.\n\nAll I wanted to do was use the ATM.  Then some thugs in ski masks bust in and hold me at gunpoint, threatening to shoot me if they didn't open the register.  I thought it was all over until the weirdest damn thing happened.  See, one of the guys took my wallet and started pocketing all my cash.  But when they saw my driver's license, this tough, beefy criminal starts freaking out.  \n\n\"It's him!  It's the guy on the \"No Harm\" list!  We just held Mike Peterson at gunpoint!\"  \n\nOne of the other guys grabbed my wallet, looked inside, and just froze.  \"Oh shit,\" he said.  \"If Roz finds out, we're fucking dead!\"  So the thugs just drop my wallet on the ground and pulls some money out of his pocket.  He hands it to me and tells me \"please don't tell Roz.  It was a mistake, honestly!\"  Then they ran out of there as fast as they could.  And I was left standing there as everyone in the bank looked at me, wondering what the hell just happened.  No way it could be *that* Roz...right?\n\nRoz was one of those girls you only think exist in movies.  The girl that comes into your life to turn it upside down, that wild and rebellious girl who gets you to loosen up and enjoy life.  She did ever since we were kids and when high school came around I gathered up the courage to ask her out.  We dated for a few years but when college rolled around, we realized we were heading separate ways in life.  So we broke up, very amicably, and eventually lost touch.  It wasn't until I started tracking her down that I realized she had even come back to town.  \n\nFinding her location was surprisingly easy.  I drove into the shadier part of town and started asking around.  Whenever I said her name, their faces would get deathly pale.  Some just ran away, terrified for their lives.  The ones who didn't filled me in.  Apparently, Roz is basically the queen of some massive criminal organization with influence all over the world.  She's basically the queen of crime.  No one even jaywalks without getting her permission.  Those who disobeyed her had a habit of disappearing.  \n\nI couldn't believe it.  Roz, some evil mastermind?  She was one of the sweetest people on the planet.  No way she was some sort of super mafia boss.  As I dug deeper, I learned that she apparently put me on a \"No Harm\" list.  Though it wasn't much of a list as I was apparently the only one on it.  None of her old friends or even her family made it on the list (which wasn't surprising considering the strained relationship she had with her parents).  Roz decreed that anyone who tried to harm me in any way was to be killed.  After a little more digging, I finally found what I was looking for- the address of her headquarters.\n\nSo I here I was, standing outside of some abandoned looking warehouse, about to meet my criminal ex-girlfriend.  All in all, not how I expected to spend my Saturday.  I walked to the entrance and some big bouncer looking type stopped me.  \"Sir, I'm gonna half to ask you to leave.\"\n\n\"Look, I'm here to see Roz, she's an old friend of mine and-\" Without warning, the guy started walking towards me.  He reached for a gun and cocked it.\n\n\"Sir, no on sees the boss.  Now, please leave or I will *make* you leave.\"\n\nI put my hands up defensively and shouted \"My name is Mike Peterson!  Please, I just want to talk to Roz!\"\n\nThe guy's face looked pale and he backed up immediately.  \"Mike Peter- my apologies sir, I didn't know!\"  He then got on his knees and started begging.  \"Please, *please* don't tell the boss about this!  I wouldn't have done it if I had known who you were!\"\n\n\"Uh, sure,\" I said, wanting to move this along as quickly as possible before it got more awkward.  \n\nThe guy got up and walked back to the door, holding it open for me.    He was sweating now, his facing showing pure terror.  \"Please, sir, after you.\"  I steeled myself for what would happen next and walked in.\n\nI expected a lot of things.  But I didn't expect to see Roz sitting on a golden throne atop a massive pile of money.\n\nThe guard approached the pile and said \"Ma'am, Mike Peterson has come to speak with you.\"\n\nRoz looked like she was in intense thought about something but once she heard my name she turned her attention to me, her face beaming with joy.  \"Mikey!  Oh my gosh, it is you!\"  She slid down the money pile and gave me a massive hug.  \"I missed you so much.  You look good.  Gosh, what's it been, 10?  12 years?\"\n\n\"Yeah, just about.  I see you've been...busy,\" I said, motioning to the pile.\n\n\"Oh, yes, it's been a great quarter.  But with the upcoming expansions I expect to see some massive improvements.  Come on, let's catch up.\"  With that, Roz took my hand and led me to an elevator.  She pushed a button and we went down.  \n\nTurns out the place was way bigger than I thought.  Underneath the warehouse were greenhouses for pot, crates full of guns, and tables of people counting stacks of $100 bills.  She even had a private jet down here.  As we walked through warehouse, Roz told me all about how she ended up here.  Selling pot to pay for college, which became a lucrative business.  She hired some people to help and the operation grew to selling illegal imports, from Kinder eggs to assault rifles.  The money she earned helped pay for high-tech equipment to set up other branches of her \"business\" all around the world.  Plenty of gangs and mafias were against her taking over but they were either taken down or forced to join.  In just over a decade, Roz became the criminal mastermind of the world.  She even had enough power to influence government policies and could even control the elections.  She had become the shadow government ruling the world behind the curtain.\n\n\"So after cementing my authority,\" Roz continued.  \"I decided I should use my newfound power for good.  And because of that, the world is a safer place.  Crime is dropping every year, Mike.  Sure, some crazy guy starts murdering people every once in a while.  We can't control that.  But drug trafficking, armed robberies, even political corruption?  That we can control.\"\n\n\"Wow, Roz.  I'll admit, your means are...unorthodox.  But you've definitely made the world a better place.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mike,\" she said, wrapping her arms around my neck.  \"I always regretted losing touch with you.  I know we had to go our separate ways but I always wanted to reconnect with you.  That's why I came back, why I put you on the list.  I wanted to see you again and catch up.  Maybe grab a bite to eat.  Like the good old days.\"\n\nI stared into her eyes for what seemed like eternity and I felt like I did in high school all over again.  Just me and her, nothing else.  I missed this feeling.  I missed Roz.  \"I'd like that,\" I said finally.\n\n\"Oh, I almost forgot,\" she said.  \"I've got another surprise for you.\"  She ushered me over to the other side of the room.  All I could think about was how little she changed.  She was still that spunky girl, carving her own path to save the world.  Sure she did it through organized crime but the at least it was organized.  She was still that same kindhearted girl I fell in love with all those years ago. \n\nShe led me to a dimly lit room at the far end of the basement level.  Inside, bound and gagged, were three men.  They looked terrified but Roz was practically beaming with pride.  \"So, what do you think?\"\n\n\"Roz, who are these people?\"\n\n\"These are the no good dirty thugs who held you at gunpoint at the bank.  I had my men track them down and bring them here to educate them.\"  With that, Roz whipped out a handgun and loaded a clip.  She pointed it at the one on the left and slowly drifted it across all three of them.  \"Now,\" she said.  \"Which one of you little shits put a gun to my Mikey's head?\"\n\nOkay, maybe she wasn't the *exact* same kindhearted girl I fell in love with.\n\nEDIT: HOLY FUCKING SHIT I FINALLY STRUCK GOLD! Not gonna lie, I half-assed this story at 2AM and was too tried to proofread it.  I honestly thought it was kind of meh but I liked the prompt and I already spent so much time on it so I posted anyway.  Guess I'm just too hard on myself.  To read more of my work, check out my award-winning novel that I've totally started.  It's coming out soonish, I promise!\n\nEDIT 2: I wanted to write part 2 in the comments below but it got really long.  So I created a brand new subreddit to post it right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mikesonofpeter/comments/81weik/wp_during_a_bank_robbery_youre_surprised_when_the/).  Come over to r/mikesonofpeter to read the conclusion to this story.  Who knows, maybe I'll write more there?",

Like to the overall tone of the story it's not important, but still.\n\nLike Chard was an arrogant douche-nozzle so roz made sure that most job applications that would provide him with a career were refused, or she felt sorry for Dave, or he was the shy, but nice guy so she made sure that by total coincidence, some investors with big pockets were at Dave's pitch or something.\n\nI might be extrapolating from the text, but putting them in the usual high school cliches, it makes sense at least in my head, if she has the power to influence governments, then she sure as hell can pull some strings.\n\n/u/SuperIdiot360 would you answer the lore question?",

Chad was a massive prick who had no backup plan if football failed and no natural drive to improve himself.  Dave was smart and driven by his desire to prove himself to the people who mocked him.  His hard work paid off and now he takes his helicopter to the Gulf Shores in between charity events.\n\nRoz was probably that weird girl no one talked to because she was outspoken and dyed her hair weird colors.  She didn't really care about anyone from her high school except Mike so she never meddled with any of their lives.\n\nExcept Stacy McCullen.  Fuck that bitch, Roz had someone cut that skank's brakes.  Now she can't move anything below her neck.  Shouldn't have called her \"Schnoz\" in high school, bitch.  Now look at you.",

            "comment": "I was half way to work by the time I realized I\u2019d forgotten to stop at the bank the day before, looking down at the clock on the dash I thought I\u2019d have just enough time for a quick stop. The bank was on the way, and it\u2019s usually quiet this early in the morning. \n\nI pulled up into the parking lot, with 10 or so cars it was more full than expected. Oh well, I was here already. \nGrabbing my purse off the passenger seat, I shut my car door, not bothering to lock it, and head into the small brown building.  \n\nThere was a man in a blue suit coming out as I was heading in, he held the door for me, and I heard a voice call out to him \u201cmake that Vanilla, Mark, not mocha\u201d, I met eyes with this Mark and we smiled briefly, and I continued inside. \n\nI was surprised to not be greeted by the familiar smell of coffee, every time I came in they always had something brewed for customers to enjoy while they waited. I looked around and saw 2 girls working at the tills, and about 6 customers in the lobby with 3 lined up in queue, I took my spot in line, and wondered if Sam was working. \n\nSam was an office manager at this bank, we knew each other briefly from high school, but really started to get to know each other later on. When I started banking here, actually.  I could see into one of the loan managers offices, a young couple was in the middle of an appointment, but their interviewer was a redheaded woman. \n\n\u201cI can take you here\u201d the girl in the middle till called, bringing me back to reality. With a smile I quickly walked over, \u201cwithdrawal please\u201d and I gave her my account information. \n\nThe girl, whose nameplate I noticed said Bridget, completed my transaction. I slid the cash she handed me into my wallet, and was putting that back in my purse, when a loud voice from behind sounded,\n\n\u201cEverybody down on the ground\u201d\n\nI jumped, started, and turned around. Before I had a chance to register what was happening, a large man appeared a few feet ahead of me with a pistol in his hand. \n\n\u201cI said, on the ground. Everybody complies, no one gets hurt.\u201d \n\nMy heart lurched as realization washed over me, and I dropped to my knees, then fell onto my stomach.  I closed my eyes, not wanting to believe I was really in the middle of this, but after a moment, curiosity got the better of me. Arms crossed under my head, I opened one eye. I could see 3 men, all wearing blue jeans, black hoodies and black ski masks. All armed with some sort of firearm. \n\nOne man had pushed his way into the loan managers office, I could see the young couple on the floor. The redhead was presumably behind her desk. I hadn\u2019t heard any gunshots, so alive, I hoped. \n\n\u201cI want all of the money in both of your registers, put it in these\u201d it was the first man I\u2019d seen, he was pointing his gun at Bridget, and threw a canvas bag on her counter. Another at the girl next to her, \u201c no panic buttons. No funny business. Do what I say or I will shoot you\u201d\n\nI could hear both of the girls crying while they scrambled to comply, \u201cwhere\u2019s the rest of it?\u201d  The man demanded, looking into both of the bags, \u201cI told you I\u2019m not fucking around here!\u201d\n\nBridget took a deep breath and shakily said \u201cwe j-just opened. We don\u2019t start with m-much in the register because not a lot of people come this early. Please don\u2019t hurt us, you don\u2019t have to do this\u201d\n\n\u201cFucking Christ, well where is your safe? I want this bag full in the next two minutes or she\u2014\u201c he turned slightly, and pointed his gun directly at my head \u201c\u2014 she dies. You want her blood on your hands?!\u201d \n\nI could feel my chest tighten and it felt hard to breathe. I tried to breathe in and out, slowly. I dealt with anxiety long enough to know a panic attack was going to happen. There\u2019s no breathing exercise that could help me right now though, \n\n\u201cSir please do\u2014\u201c\n\u201cSafe. Now. Get me the fucking money or this bitch will have her brains all over your floor\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t! Sir pl\u2014\u201c \n\u201c one! \u201c\n\u201cI can\u2019t open it\u201d \n\u201cThen you better tell me who can, two!\u201d\n\nI was full on hyperventilating at this point, breathing in and out faster than I thought possible, and crying, choking, I coughed in between sobs, and knew i was going to attract attention, but I couldn\u2019t stop. It felt like I was being chased by a horrible monster and all I could do was lay still. Thoughts flashing through my head of my mom hearing the news. I know it would destroy her, I was her only child. My dad would become withdrawn, that\u2019s how he handled stress, but I know it would kill him too \n\n\u201cOnly the manager can open the safe\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m losing my patience here, who is the manager?!\u201d\n\u201cMark, but he\u2019s not here.. our coffee machine broke, so he went to go buy coffee for the staff\u201d\n\nThe man made an irritated noise, and I could tell he was thinking. Luckily he\u2019d pulled his gun away so it wasn\u2019t pointing at me. \n\u201cSlowly get in front of this counter. I want you both on the floor in front\u201d \n\nThe girls ended up laying near me and they were crying, softly. I\u2019d managed to get a hold on my panic which was slightly subsiding. The other man had had the same idea to get all of us together, I could see everyone from in the office also laying in the lobby now. The two men were whispering to each other a few feet away, \n\u201cThis is not how we planned it\u201d\n\u201cI know that damn it, you think that was my fault?\u201d\n\u201cNo- but the boss is going to be pissed. We don\u2019t have nearly enough money\u201d\n\u201cI have an idea\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright\u201d the shorter second man  yelled \u201chere\u2019s what we are doing. When I tell you, you are going to SLOWLY pull out your wallet and hand to me. If you don\u2019t want to be shot, I\u2019d suggest you do not move until I tell you to\u201d\n\nHe started on the other side of the lobby, the redhead. Then the young couple. A few of the other customers, the girls from behind the registers didn\u2019t have wallets with them, and then me. \n\n\u201cAlright sweetheart, I\u2019m gonna need that wallet now,\u201d this man seemed much more calm than the first, I reached into my purse, grabbed my wallet and slid it on the floor to him. \n\nHe picked it up, and opened it. Took out the cash I\u2019d just withdrawn, $600, he counted. Must have figured it was better than nothing, and he put it into the bag on the counter.  He looked at my wallet, and then at me, \u201cChelsea Rose Fuller? Well Chelsea, I hope you enjoyed Banking with us today\u201d he laughed cruelly, and dropped my wallet on the floor walking back to the other man who\u2019d been looking around the bank\n\n\u201cWhat was that name you said a minute ago?\u201d His partner asked\n\u201cWhat? The chick on the ground there?\u201d\n\u201cYeah whatever name you said, Chelsea something?\u201d\n\u201cChelsea rose fuller\u201d\n\u201cFuller.. you\u2019re sure?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, man what\u2019s your prob\u2014\u201c\n\nThe bigger man was already halfway to me, and I flinched, \n\u201cGet up. Now!\u201d\nToo shocked to move, he grabbed my arm and pulled me up, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He was no longer yelling but it sounded like he was trying to restrain himself\n\n\u201cUmm.. Chelsea?\u201d\n\u201cYour full name\u201d\n\u201cChelsea -Rose Fuller\u201d\n\u201cFuck. That\u2019s what I thought\u201d\n\nHe pulled out his cell phone, and started typing something. I heard his phone chime and he clicked on something. Turning his phone toward me, he asked \u201cis that you?\u201d\n\nI read on his phone \nChelsea rose fuller \nDob: 02/12/1996\n class of 2014\nBorn Denver, CO\nParents: Dana &amp; Rob Fuller\n\nI gasped and looked at him, shocked. I almost lied but didn\u2019t \u201cyes that\u2019s me, why do you have all that?\u201d \n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he ran his fingers through his hair, \u201cfuck!\u201d \n\u201cAlright, change of plans. First, I need you to know neither of us will hurt you. That you can be sure of. Second, I need you to come with us.\u201d \n\nThen yelling behind him \u201cD we need to go! Now!\u201d \n\nHe put his hand on my arm, gently, and steered me toward the door.  He said they wouldn\u2019t hurt me but they were still armed. The third man, who must have been in the back room during this exchange, came out with a large bag that looked full, \u201cwe\u2019re good guys, I got it\u201d he told the other two, and looked at me, clearly confused, \u201cfind yourself a girlfriend J?\u201d He laughed \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain in the car\u201d\n\nI was pulled out of the building and into a black SUV, there was no license plate on it, the small man, J, got in the driver seat and I was pushed between the other two in the back, he peeled out of the parking lot and started heading out of town. \n\nWe drove for what must have been hours, not one of them saying a word to me. I figured if they were going to kill me they would have done it by now, and what was it about my name? How did they have all of this info about me? I hoped my parents were okay. \n\n\n***\nThis has turned out way longer than I thought.  So if y\u2019all want more I\u2019ll type more ",

            "comment": "(Content note: violence) \n\nI crouched behind the counter, drenched in fear. The shouts and screams surrounded me, but all I could focus on was the sound of my heart pounding and the sickening dread in my stomach. The gunshot booms ricocheted through the marble room as I shrank down and silently prayed that I hadn\u2019t been seen. \nI could hear footsteps approaching and couldn\u2019t control my panicked breathing. I felt strong arms suddenly grab me from behind and roughly haul me up. Someone yanked my head up and I saw a balaclava clad face inches from mine.\n\n\u201cShit. Fuck, not this one,\u201d hissed the balaclava in front of me. \u201cTake him to the van.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the safe...\u201d objected the voice of my captor behind me. \n\n\u201cJust fucking do it, now!\u201d \n\nI heard the muttered complaints of my assailant as he dragged me across the foyer, through the doors and into the startlingly bright sunlight. I was too confused and terrified to do anything other than allow myself to be carried along. There was a metal banging sound and then I felt myself being thrown into a cool dark space I assumed was a van. My face was pressed against the floor as someone bound my hands behind me, then I heard the doors close and the engine start.\nI struggled to flip myself over onto my back as the van started to move. Over the noise of the engine, I could hear voices arguing. \n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the plan, what the hell? Where\u2019s Jack?\u201d shouted a panicked female voice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s him. The one on the list,\u201d said a male voice.\n\n\u201cFucking hell, seriously?!\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, so are you going to be the one to fuck up Lucy\u2019s list? Cos I\u2019m sure as hell not,\u201d replied the male voice, \u201cEven if I have to leave Jack behind.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh fuck man, poor Jack,\u201d sighed the female voice. \n\nThe two voices fell silent as the van continued on its journey. My mind was racing as I tried to figure out what the hell was going on. Lucy, Jack, who were these people? What the fuck had just happened? How had my morning errand dropping off some takings from the shop to the bank taken such a surreal turn? I tried to loosen my wrists but they were tied too tight with some kind of hard plastic that bit into my skin with every wriggle. \n\u201cWhat is this?! Where am I!?\u201d I shouted over the noise of the engine, but there was no reply. I continued to shout to no avail. I have no idea how long we drove for but after what felt like an age, I felt the van lurch as the brakes slammed on, sending my head crashing into the side of the van. The pain exploded behind my eyes as I sank into darkness. \n\nThe next thing I recall was slowly becoming aware of voices around me and the pain in my head. I opened my eyes and the light blinded me. As I blinked, the figures above me slowly came into focus. I appeared to be lay on a bed, and my hands were no longer bound. A smiling female face hovered above my own and a cool hand smoothed my forehead. \n\n\u201cThere you are Chris, I was worried about you for a moment,\u201d said the woman, in a familiar voice.\n\n\u201cWhere am I? What happened?\u201d I muttered in confusion. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe now, sweetheart, you\u2019re with Lucy.\u201d\n\nLucy. I only knew one Lucy. I tried to raise my head and focus clearly on the woman\u2019s face. It was her. It was Lucy. Older, a little more worn, but definitely the same blue eyes, looking at me with the same affectionate expression I\u2019d loved as a 16 year old boy. I\u2019d not seen her for ten years or more but had thought of her often. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why am I here?\u201d \n\n\u201cI saved you. I\u2019d always save you. You of all people should know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at the bank...those robbers...?\u201d Fuck, I was so confused. \n\n\u201cYou mean my employees,\u201d she said with a wry smile. \n\nI pushed myself up to a sitting position. Lucy stood beside me, dressed immaculately in a black pinstripe suit. Her black hair, once long and flowing in our teens, had been cut into a sharp angular bob. Her pale, elfin face was punctuated with a slash of bright red lipstick. She looked fucking incredible. Despite my circumstances, I felt a swell of attraction to her, as flashes of teen love memories flitted through my head. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it Chris?\u201d \n\nI looked around - I was in what looked like a plush hotel suite, all decked out in white. Two other people, dressed in medical scrubs hovered by the door. \n\n\u201cLeave us now,\u201d Lucy commanded. They silently nodded and filed out. \n\n\u201cJesus, Lucy, what is this place?\u201d I stammered. \n\n\u201cWelcome to my office, Chris. I\u2019ve done quite well for myself in the last few years.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour employees...?\u201d I let the question hang in the air. She smiled and walked around to sit on the heavy wooden desk.\n\n\u201cYes. My teams are the best at what they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cRobbing banks?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong other activities,\u201d she smiled again and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy since I last saw you.\u201d\n\nI felt a twinge of guilt and regret at her statement. \n\n\u201cFucking hell, Lucy, I always knew you\u2019d do well but some kind of mafia boss? Is that what you are?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking. I don\u2019t associate with the Mafia though. Unless our patches cross.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy have you brought me here? What\u2019s going to happen to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cDarling, my teams know not to touch you. There\u2019s a list, you see. Working as I do in our area, my employees are bound to come across former associates and acquaintances of mine. I\u2019ve made a new life for myself, I\u2019m an entirely different person, but still, there\u2019s some people I remember fondly.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven me? After...\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, even you. Especially you.\u201d \n\nI felt the twinge of guilt became louder as I recalled the last time I\u2019d seen her. \n\n\u201cListen, I was just a kid. I didn\u2019t realise what I was doing,\u201d I hope she realised I truly meant it. \n\n\u201cThinking with your dick?\u201d She looked at me, her expression hardening. I coughed uncomfortably. \n\n\u201cI just...she was there, you know? I was drunk and it just happened.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrow raised. \u201cJust happened? What, you tripped and your dick fell in her?\u201d \n\nI blushed at the memory of drunken teenage fumbling. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt you, I just couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut with her? My supposed best friend?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t mean to hurt you, we weren\u2019t thinking straight...\u201d I stuttered trying to justify, explain, reason, anything. She continued to stare at me with a cold, unflinching expression. \n\n\u201cAnd was it worth it? Did you both live happily ever after?\u201d \n\n\u201cWell no, I\u2019ve not seen Emma since either. No one\u2019s seen her for years now, she moved away or something, no one knows where she went...\u201d my speech started to fail as I watched Lucy\u2019s expression change to a twisted smile. Surely she didn\u2019t? My dawning realisation turned to horror, as Lucy laughed a bitter laugh. \n\n\u201cLucy, what the fuck happened to Emma? What the fuck did you do?\u201d I struggled to push myself off the bed, but my legs crumpled beneath me. I lay there, stranded helplessly as Lucy slowly stalked towards me. She stared at me like I was prey. \n\n\u201cLucy, Jesus fuck, Lucy, we were kids, let me go, I\u2019m so sorry Lucy...\u201d the garbled words fell out of me as I tried to push myself up, but I was too weak. She crouched next to me and kissed me softly on the head. The last thing I heard was the click of the cold metal against my temple. \n",

            "comment": "(Ugh why does waiting at the bank take so long) I thought to myself (the one day I'm not too busy to walk inside and the frickin lines are a mile long.)\n\nThe people in front of me shuffle like zombies when the front guy leaves, meaning I'm moving about a foot from where I was before.\n\n(Seriously!!) There's a woman in front who brought her dang kid and IS HE SERIOUSLY COUNTING PENNIES ONE BY FRICKIN ONE!!! UGHHHH!!!\n\nThis is why I never walk in the bank. I always prefer the drive throughs, but today I didn't have as many errands to run so I decided to walk in and maybe grab me an actual piece of candy without having to awkwardly ask for it bc I'm an adult who is supposed to be repulsed by the idea of sweets but hey, gotta love them little suckers.\n\nMy thought process is immediately halted as three men with ski masks and assault rifles barge inside the door demanding everyone get down on the ground. I throw my hands up as one of them waves a gun towards me and I survey the door out of the corner of my eye, but I'm worried he will shoot me as it's too far away, so I slowly sink down to my knees before I hear the police sirens and he forcibly grabs my arm.\n\n\"Any funny business, and I shoot you all one by one,\" he yelled, \"starting with you!\" His tongue like a snake in my ear as I'm disgusted by the way he whispered it like a rapist. He slides his hand down my ass and I use my other hand to slap his away. He smiles and throws me down on the ground with force before he searches my pockets for whatever money he thinks I'm carrying, sliding his eyes down my boobs and stopping at the nametag sewn into my work shirt.\n\nHe stops immediately and gets this horrified expression on his face. He jumps up and backs away slowly. \"What are ya doin, Paul!!\"\n\n\"That's her! That's her!! The one the boss says we cant touch!! Im dead!! Im a dead man!! I can't do this, man!!\" The man in the ski mask drops his gun and runs outside hands up to the police, surrendering himself. One of the other two men holds his gun towards me and demands I tell him who I am.\n\n\"I'm Kay. Kay Peterson.\"\n\nThe second man becomes just as horrified, takes his mask off, and puts the gun in his mouth. Pieces of him go everywhere as everyone screams. I get up and look towards the third man, who looks too scared to move. Everyone's eyes are on me, like I'm some sort of savior. The third man is so terrified to move that he pisses himself as I walk closer. Then he starts spouting off nonsense about how I'm on a 'No Harm' list and his boss is gonna make them wish they were dead without actually giving them the pleasure of death.\n\n\"And who is your boss?\" I ask.\n\nHe drops his gun and falls on his hands and knees begging me not to tell his boss that he will do anything I ask as long as I did not tell that they held me at gunpoint, blabbering about how he has a family to support and he really didn't wanna do this, blah blah blah...\n\n\"Just give me a damn name!!\"\n\nHe climbs to his knees and starts praying in a foreign language and hands me a note before assuming his bitch position, still praying for dear life.\n\nI open the paper and become flabbergasted to the name as I had not heard it in many years.\n\nEric Drake\n\nBut there was no way.\n\nEric was always shy and reserved. He was the kind of guy that would do anything you needed from him. Albeit he was pretty naive at times. We became fast friends as kids and I admit I had a minor crush on him after the summer of '03 when he hit puberty and became hot, but regrettably that same year he moved and we lost touch a long time ago. He was the sweetest guy I knew. So there was absolutely no way that he could instill this much fear into a group of thugs.\n\nI tossed the paper into my pocket and threw my hands up when the police marched in and escorted everyone out. I also made a mental note to look Eric up on social media to see if I could find him again.",

                    "comment": "Here it is. Here is when I start mentally freaking out. I know I shouldn't, it's just Eric. But if he can scare three hardened thugs into praying, turning themselves in, or killing himself rather publicly, I can only imagine what he could do to me if I pissed him off. I say this now because I'm sitting in front of his, should I say house? Looks more like a mansion than just a house. I don't see much from the road, a lot of trees and a driveway that goes behind the house and apparently comes back to the road. This makes me even more nervous.\n\nI think about Eric the way I used to back when we were kids and chastise myself for being ridiculous. This is Eric were talking about. The boy who wouldn't hurt a fly. The boy who took a beating for a helpless bird after the neighborhood bullies shot it out of a tree with a pellet rifle. The same boy I had a pretty huge crush on before he left. Not his fault, I know, but I was still sour about it bc he and I were close.\n\nI checked my notepad to see if I had the right address. After that robbery last week, I tried to look him up on facebook. That's where I got the address.\n\n15673 South Street. In a town that was just about an hour from me. I made sure to look this place up on Google Maps before I tried looking for it blindly. It was one of the nicer houses on this block. Then out of force of habit, I started briefly wondering about what if he got robbed, then I gave myself the \"you are so stupid!\" face in my rearview mirror. If he can scare people that bad, I wouldn't wanna rob him either.\n\nI gain a small piece of courage after laughing at myself. For what reason I don't know, maybe I'm going crazy beating myself up over this. I inch my car toward the driveway before I hear a *tap tap tap* on my car window that scares the absolute bejesus out of me, u might as well thought I had a gun go off by my ear. I'm such a nervous wreck. I take a look at the guy, who motions me to roll my window down.\n\n\"You ok? Do you need help?\" He also motions his hands in sign language. The man is tanned and well toned in his jogging outfit. I can hear his music blaring from the headset he took off.\n\nI look back at the house and turn back to him with a shaky voice, \"n-no I think I'm ok. Physically anyway. Just meeting someone I ain't seen since middle school and ain't talked to since we graduated and I am a nervous wreck bc I hadn't seen him in years and apparently people are really scared of him.\" My voice steadies as I go into blabbermouth mode.\n\nThe guy just laughs. Like the good belly busting jolly kind of laugh that brings tears to your eyes.\n\n\"What's so funny to you?\" I'm starting to get kinda angry at the fact that he's laughing like he's heard the best joke in years, but apparently it becomes contagious when I start laughing at how ridiculous I sound.\n\nTen minutes later, the laughter dies down a bit. \"Well I can probably help u with the meeting part. Come on,\" he motions me to turn off the car and come with him. He jogs up the driveway to the back door and opens it, checking to see if I'm behind him. My pace is kinda slower than his so I move faster. He closes the door behind me and starts sneaking around the building.\n\nWe come into the kitchen and hear a chef coming, so he grabs my arm and quickly jumps behind a shelf. I can't see anything except this guy. Who is apparently sneaking around like he's fixing to do something bad. The chef leaves and this guy walks over to the other side of the kitchen and pulls a lever, opening a secret door. I hurriedly follow, afraid of getting caught. I've seen all the mafia movies and episodes of law and order where they take down a huge crime boss that no one talks about bc he is well feared. I've seen what those guys did to people who didn't do as they wanted. And I'm sure sneaking around my old middle school friend's house would definitely not be a very good thing to be doing at all.\n\nWe come to the end of this secret hallway and come back outside, but this time I believe it's behind the house. He motions me to follow him w a sly from on his face and he crouches through the garden and up to a table that has two places set for drinking tea. He sits at one of the places and starts outwardly mocking rich people with the pinkie up and the high chin like he just smelled shit but he can't tell where it's from. He then motions for me to join him while keeping that composure.\n\n\"Ah, yes madam, would you like a cup of tea, hmm?\" He asks in that mocking highbrow accent. I start laughing and in good fun, I curtsy to him and exclaim, \"Why yes, good sir, I'd love a cup of tea. Why thank you for asking. I'll take 2 sugars please.\" I say in my most pride-and-prejudice like voice, even making good to move my \"dress\" accordingly to sit properly in the chair. I even give him a few *hmms* and *ahs* along with making sure I had the same shit-smell expression on my face and my pinkie was high in the air whilst I sipped.\n\nIt became a little game that we kept laughing at. And I didn't even know who this man was, yet I was having the time of my life. We played our little game for what seemed like a good half hour before I realized, \"oh good sir, I do believe I am out of tea.\" We keep laughing when he makes a motion for someone to bring us some more. \"Alfred, I require more tea for myself and for my guest,\" he used his funny high brow accent which made me laugh some more, until an actual butler came and brought us some more tea. It momentarily scared me bc I was sure he was gonna throw us out for being on his employers land without permission, but he didn't, instead he wordlessly did as he was told and then walked away.\n\nMy fun became soured at the idea that we could be in serious trouble, and the fact that this guy kept laughing like he was the only one in on some great joke. \"What's so funny?\" I was more terrified than angry, but my voice gave off anger. He continued to laugh. I looked around worried we were gonna be stormed by police any minute, or worse, armed guards ready to make us sleep with the fishes. He still kept on laughing the more terrified I became. I measured how far it was to my car and how far I could run without getting shot when his laughter finally died down.\n\n\"Oh man, Kay. You should've seen your face,\" he starts laughing again, only this time it's almost like he's trying hard not to but can't help it. \"I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. You just seemed so nervous in your car that I felt I had to help you out.\"\n\nI can imagine my face is pretty dumbfound. And then I kick myself for not noticing sooner. I mean why didn't I? His face had lost all it's cute chubbiness when last I saw him only some was gone and his facial structure was probably the only thing that still remained. Even his glasses were no more.\n\n\"Eric!\"",

            "comment": "Lily always had a thing for mischief. \n\nIn high school she would hide under that sly smile of hers, watching the innocent get blamed for her carefully planned antics. She was a ghost amidst the currents of students. But, if you were fortunate enough to spot her doodling alone in the corners, you would be hopping from graveyards to haunted houses. \n\nWe fell in stupid love together.\n\nSoon, I became her partner in crime. I still remember Danny Dunning's tears when old teacher Senchal sent him to detention, convinced that it had been him who released the rodent.\n\nIt had been twenty years since we broke up. Lily now sat at the other side of the desk. Her relentless beauty had aged like a good scotch; but her silly passion for mischief had turned into a nefarious syndicate of crime -- which she ran.\n\n\"Robert! You look terrible,\" Lily said and smiled. God, that smile.\n\nI smirked, \"Coming from you, I take that as a great compliment,\" I said and chuckled. \"So, you are running a crime syndicate now?\"\n\n\"Yes! Isn't it wonderful? I get to doodle all day and get paid for it. It's just like what we did in high school,\" she said. \"Honestly, you would be surprised how similar it is.\"\n\nI drew my lips into a line and flinched slightly, she didn't believe her words, didn't she? \"You could say such things, but now you have thugs involved, willing to harm people,\" I said. \"That's not quite the same in my opinion.\"\n\nLily sputtered and raised an eyebrow. \"Do you think me a fool that can't come up with a plan where no one gets hurt?\"\n\nI tugged the collar of my shirt and swallowed. \"I...I trust your abilities, I've been a part of them. But still, it *is* wrong to rob banks and such.\"\n\nShe sighed deeply. \"Listen Rob, we both know why you came here, and we both know it wasn't to pay me a simple visit.\"\n\n\"It wasn't? This is news to me.\"\n\nLily slid a bunch of papers across the desk. \"Sign them. I missed my partner in crime,\" she said and smiled her sly smile.\n\nFuck.\n\nI grabbed the pen.\n\n------------------------------\n\n/r/therobertfall for more stories!\n",

            "comment": "I'd known Payton was something else for a while. What exactly I didn't know at first, just that she was the perfect mix of girl next door and seductress. We spent some time actively trying to hate each other back in high school, then we tried not to fall in love so we didn't have to deal with long distance. It didn't work - after almost a year of avoiding it, I asked her out about two weeks before I left for college. Things had their ups and downs, but all in all we were pretty good together. Or so I thought. She eventually dumped me out of the blue for not fixing something she never told me needed fixing. She went on a tech cleanse shortly after, making it near impossible to hold a conversation with her because she was always busy or avoiding her phone. So as much as I wanted to stay on touch, she made it frustratingly difficult, and after she'd hurt me so much without really apologizing I was done thinking of her.\n\nYears went by. I dated a few folks, had a few hookups. I wound up going into industry for a few years before getting my PhD instead of getting it all done at once. On the plus side, I don't think I would have considered Pompeu Fabra University way back then, and damn is Barcelona gorgeous. And apparently the locals went crazy over a towering American with an undercut. (Well, towering by European standards anyways.)\n\nEverything in my life was going fairly good when it had happened - I was on break, getting some cash so I could ask Isabella out to get some coffee. Or I was until the guy in front of me pulled out a pistol and started yelling for everybody to get on the ground. I immediately complied, wishing my concealed carry permit was valid here. I heard a few guys talking, telling people to stay down or let go of their purse or to open the drawer and put the money in the bag. I silently cursed when I felt a hand take my wallet from my back pocket. His curse, however, was very much not silent.\n\n\"Mald*ic\u00edon*,\" he said, almost groaning at the end. \"Ra\u00fal, mira.\" I heard footsteps and prayed I wasn't about to be shot for causing trouble.\n\n\"Mierda.\" The new voice - presumably Ra\u00fal - sounded as distressed after the first. After a pause, I felt a boot poke my leg as he said \"Lev- eh, stand please.\" Not wanting to question the switch to my native tongue, I stood slowly, and took the wallet he held out to me - wait, my wallet? \"Great apologies, se\u00f1or Allen. Please, take these for the troubles we have caused.\" He reached into his pocket and pulled out several large bills. As I took them, he added, \"Just please, do not tell La Diablita.\" I would have asked a question if I could have figured out which one to start with, but he evidently didn't have time to explain; he barked some orders to his men and they left promptly.\n\nAfter a moment of standing around confused, I snapped out of it. If I was going to solve this on my own I was going to need to *not* waste days in a holding cell letting the beauracracy try to decide if I was an accomplice or not. I handed a couple bills to a lady crying over her purse, then made a beeline for a teller. \"\u00bfTienes una puerta de atr\u00e1s?\" They hesitated a moment until I gave them another bill, then let me out the back. Hearing sirens, I hoped it would take them at least a day to work out who I was. Nonetheless, I acted like I only had an hour.\n\nI made my way to my apartment, trying to figure out who \"The Little She-Devil\" was. She was apparently big crime boss, managing a syndicate that spanned from the Atlantic to Germany. Little was known about her, but it was suspected she had some sort of mental illness or was at the very least extremely indecisive; the syndicate changed fairly regularly and without reason. For a couple years it went by the name of \"Speed Demons\" in French and focused on high-end car theft, then for no apparent reason the organization lost its name and prioritized black market firearms. Also of curiosity, \"La Diablita\" was treated as a title rather than a name, and was translated into whichever language was convenient at the time.\n\nApparently, their activity was focused in southern France, so that's where I decided to search first. I grabbed some essentials from my apartment and made my way to the train station, contacting a couple friends I had in the area. It'd take me about four hours to reach Montpellier, so hopefully someone would be willing to take me in for a day or two. Jesus, what am I getting into...\n\n~~~\n\nApparently, a four hour train ride was not enough time to answer that question. Nor was the time I spent catching up with my college buddy Adalie, or meeting her friend-of-a-friend who owned and operated a bar and was involved in some illicit activities.\n\nIt was early afternoon on a Tuesday, so there were few people out. I sat at the bar, which was being tended by a large man in a button-up who clearly took care of his bushy beard. \"Parles-tu Anglais ou Espagnol?\" I spoke a little French, but not enough to discuss such a niche topic. Especially with my mind still racing.\n\n\"Yes, English. What can I get you?\" It was really my lucky day.\n\n\"Information, and brandy while we discuss it. You're Marcus, right?\"\n\nHe became wary, but poured my drink nonetheless - probably confident in his staff's ability to take care of me if needed. \"Depends, why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I'm trying to contact someone so I can thank them for saving my life. I think you know of Me Petit Diable?\"\n\nHe paused, clearly curious as I sipped my drink. \"Saved your life? Who are you?\"\n\nNow for the moment of truth. \"Allen Garthen.\"\n\n\"Connerie. Show me proof.\" So my name was well-known. I took out my passport and laid it on the bar so he could see. He studied it for a minute, then looked at me again. \"Fine. If you are who you say you are, you'll need to talk to a portier - a gatekeeper. But I'm warning you, they will know if you are lying, and you do not want to find out what happens if you lie about this subject.\"\n\n\"Well that's my concern, not yours. Can you arrange a meeting?\"\n\n\"I will make an appointment. Return here at seven and I will tell you what to do next.\"\n\n~~~\n\nPart 1/2 because apparently this is over the character limit. Whoops! Part two [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/81n6ls/wp_during_a_bank_robbery_youre_surprised_when_the/dv4kocj/)!",

                    "comment": "Part 2/2!\n\n~~~\n\nIt was half past seven and I sat in a dark corner waiting for the gatekeeper. Apparently a man by the name of Marion, he was known by his nasty scars and nastier reputation. Whichever direction the syndicate took, he was both eager and adept in overseeing it.\n\nA man walked in fitting the description Marcus had given me - a hair shorter than me, with jet black hair slicked back and a facial expression like he was a puppetmaster observing his collection. It was unsettling, to say the least, and the black leather jacket didn't help. He spotted me and approached from the other side of the crowded bar. He passed my table and entered the back room, and I followed.\n\nThe back was lit a little more brightly than the front, probably because it was a space for business and labor. To one side was an assortment of kegs, and tongue other was a table with several chairs. Marion walked over and took a seat. As I followed his lead - no doubt much more nervous - he started speaking. \"Mister Garthen, I understand you wish to speak with Le Petit Diable.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then let me explain to you my role in this. Her identity is a secret for obvious legal reasons. As such, anyone who wishes to talk to Her must do so through me or one of my fellow gatekeepers. If they wish to speak with her in person, it is are job to make sure they are on a very short list of people who are allowed such contact, and it is also our job to prove they are who they say they are. I will ask you personal questions, mostly about your past. If you fail to answer them correctly, you will be made an example of to discourage other pretenders. Or you can walk out that door and we can forget this happened.\" He paused a moment. \"Shall we begin then?\" I nodded. I was scared shitless, but I was committed now. He took out a notebook from the inner pocket of his jacket.\n\nThe ensuing interview was more thorough than the time I'd gotten security clearance. The questions he asked me put together a fairly complete picture of my life through high school and into college. Where there were details missing, they were mostly questions I had forgotten the answer to. After what seemed like an eternity and an attempt to live my life vicariously, he nodded slowly.\n\n\"You have convinced me, which is no easy task. Have you had dinner?\"\n\nI took a moment to sigh with relief. \"No. I've been too stressed to eat.\"\n\n\"Well get something on me. They make a nice Reuben here, or there is a cafe across the street if you want to get something lighter.\"\n\nI sat there confused for a moment. \"Can I ask why you're telling me to eat?\"\n\n\"You are a very special person to my boss. She was raised to be a perfect host, and she'd have my head if I didn't extend her hospitality. But anyways, get some food to go and I'll take you to see her.\"\n\nI had some questions - and at this point some hunches - but I decided to hold my tongue and get a Reuben on rye.\n\n~~~\n\nHalf a sandwich and 45 minutes later, I found myself waiting alone in an office room in a large two story house a little ways into the country. I paced the room, wondering who it could be that I was about to meet. Well, I had a feeling I knew, but there was no way-\n\nThe door opened to reveal all five feet of Payton, propped up a couple extra inches by heels which paired nicely with her jacket, blouse and pencil skirt. I would have dropped over that outfit all those years ago. But of course I took the opportunity to point out the part that didn't fit - \"I'd recognize that Mohawk anywhere.\"\n\nShe grinned and strutted over. \"Guess it really is you; everyone else knows not to butcher that line and let me hear it.\"\n\nI grinned back. \"And it really is you. Nobody else would give me shit for using the accurate hairstyle.\"\n\nShe gestured to a chair against the wall, taking one on the other side of a desk. \"So what's your life been like?\"\n\n\"Fairly predictable up until this morning,\" I said, sitting. \"I'm getting my doctorate in Spain, haven't really settled down yet. But what about you? Your life is clearly more interesting.\"\n\nShe leaned back and shrugged. \"Not most of it - I've only been doing this for a few years. I started a salon in the area and when it took off, a friend called me and asked me to take over this shindig for a while. It's kinda a Dread Pirate Roberts situation.\" I had a sudden flashback to watching The Princess Bride with her over winter break once. \"But you've actually come at the right time. It's about time for me to step out and let someone else take over, but I haven't found anything to do after that. But you say you're single?~\"\n\nI'm suddenly aware her shoes are off when she put her foot on my calf. She giggled as I blushed, and started slowly working her way up. \"You wanna get back together?\" I ask plainly.\n\nShe sat forwards, taking her foot off me. \"It's... something I've thought about a lot. As time went on and other people left me for the same reason, I started realizing a lot of things about myself.\" She looked down. \"I realized I didn't always treat you fairly, and I'm sorry about that.\" Looking me in the eye, she added, \"But I've changed. And I'm curious to see if we could do it right this time.\"\n\nI took a moment to digest that. \"I'm gonna need a while to think about that. Probably a long while. And I'll need to get to know you again. But I'm open to the idea.\"\n\nPayton smiled at me, and I remembered the first time I realized I loved her. Maybe we would wind up together after all, in our own version of The Princess Bride.\n\n~~~\n\nThanks for reading! Comments, critiques, and criticisms are welcome! Sorry if it's super long, I'm on mobile so I can't really compare it to the length of other stories ;_;",

            "comment": "Note: I wrote until I was too exhausted yo go on but I didnt manage to wrap it up particularily well. Might write more. I could write a whole book about Max Harding and Charlotte Fien.\n\nIn high school I was dating a guy named Max Harding. I was just a confused teenager and the cute but weird emo kid kind of became my sweetheart. I was kind of a grunge girl and was in love with Kurt Cobain but this cute guy came up to me and asked me if I had a light for his cigarette. He kind of had something in his eyes. Some kind of deep seated emotional turmoil. I got the impression that he wasnt your every day edgy emo teenager. He seemed to actually hate himself, and I felt so bad for him.\n\nDays were spent smoking weed and relaxing while listening to rock songs. We would go for walks in the city and he had his charm but he got weirder and weirder. He seemed obsessed with me, but it didnt make sense how he behaved. There was a deeper issue. He would tell me about these strange thoughts he had and while I would be very captivated, he seemed destined for life on the street.\n\nIn time his suffering became too much and I had to leave him, for my own sake. It wasn't the right thing to do but it made me so confused, angry and overall unable to love him how he needed. He started picking fights with guys who as much as hinted that they didn't approve of us and myself in particular. He was sweet but I thought life would be better for him without me and even though I might think about him sometimes as time goes on I dont miss him.\n\nI'm much happier without him and I thought he would easily get over me based on how he reacted when I broke up with him. He said \"Ok, that's fine.\" Then he took a last puff of smoke and left my appartment that I lived in at the time and as he left he turned around in the doorway and smiled. \"Cya on the other side!\" he said with a giant grin. It was the first time I saw him smile with his eyes.\n\nI never thought those words would be more than an empty phrase but years later something strange happened. I got in debt with the mafia. I developed a drinking problem and I developed bipolar, mania and depression. I don't remmember how it happened, in the hospital they convinced me that it was all a dream and I believed that until I got out and the thugs came to visit. I was stressed out. No way I could pay off 3 millions in debt. I told them, \"I don't have the money, I can't pay off the debt!\" and the scary looking criminal just told me \"That's fine. My boss will be dissapointed but I'll tell him you said that. I don't know the details but I was instructed to give you this number and we'll erase the debt.\" Then he left.\n\nI stood there for what seemed like years, and without thinking I called the number. I talked to some guy that I had never met before. He seemed friendly. In the middle of the conversation, which I don't remmember he said he had a message for me, \"The guy you're looking for lives on Tinker Street. The big house in the middle with the big fence and camera at the entrance.\" I wrote down the adress and started asking a lot of questions. He explained to me that I was on a list of protected people thanks to this guy, who was a big mover in the underground. \n\nThe next days I was so angry, confused and on the verge of losing my sanity. I went to Tinker street in a manic state but I couldn't find the big mansion he was talking about. In the middle of my dreamlike quest for finding the elusive billionaire I somehow ended up at Maxes old place. 47 Tinker Street. I walked up to his house and rang the doorbell. I just wanted answers. I was angry, manic and on a mission. He opened the door, shirtless, with long pink hair and fingerless white leather gloves. He looked happy. He had ripped jeans and a bit of a stubble. \"Charlotte?\"  he said, sounding smug. I got kind of angry and said \"Max I dont have time for your antics Im looking for an eccentric billionaire.\" \"Oh? Where does he live then?\" I looked at the note with the address. \"27 Tinker Street.\" He smirked and said with no apparent hint of irony \"I wouldn't say I'm a billionaire, but if you want me to be then I can get the money by wednesday.\" \n\nI broke down crying after that. I dont remmember what I said but I refused to believe in anything he said. He had always been a compulsive liar. He told me that he still loved me, but I knew he was lying. Then he told me the story of what happened after our breakup. He quit smoking weed and started doing breaking and entering. He got so good at it, that after a while he had a good bunch of cash so he invested it in 5 kg of Kush. Then he started saying how he got more and more people working for him and eventually buildt up an organization. It had no name but they had taken over major crime syndacutes just by reputation alone. He had been watching me from the distance and when he heard I was in debt with the mafia he gave them a call and went to negotiate. He made the don an offer he couldn't refuse. Max had apparently gone there all by himself and told him \"Charlotte Fien is protected by me, I want 5 million for the trouble and I want you to back off.\" The mafia boss just said \"I could, but I'd need four weeks to get the money,\" then he kind of stopped mid sentance, nervously paced around, although very slowly and finally said \"I'll give you 3 million, we wont harm the girl, and I'll never see you again.\" Max said that was okay, shook his hand and never saw him again. I was finally lucid again. I wasnt nervous anymore. Max Harding is the man of my dreams.\n\n",

But at least I'm meeting Bill later, we decided to catch up after these 3 years.\n\nThe door opened and a two people jogged in. One sneezed.\n\"Bless you.\" I said automatically, barely glancing at them before realising with a start at the proximity of a gun, pointed at me.\n\n\"Thank you.\" I was suddenly held in a painful chokehold, forced to stand up, metal on skin.\n\nAs I struggled to breath in the already humid air, the alarms went off.\n\n\"HAND OVER THE MONEY!\"\n\n\"GET DOWN\"\n\n\"I'M GOING TO SHOOT HER, I'M WARNING YOU!\"\n\nMaybe it was the panic. Or the blaring alarms. Or the air. But I just COULDN'T BREATHE.

Are you alright?\" \n\n\"She appears uninjured, just in shock.\"\n\n\"Oh thank goodness.\" He kept hugged me, patting my head. It's strange, I've never seen my brother in this jacket before.\n\n\"Alright I'll leave you then.\" The ambulance worker said, already looking at other victims.\n\n\n\"How did you know I was here?\" He finally lets go and I see an unfamiliar face.\n\n\"Because those shitheads said your name over the mic.

            "comment": "This? This was truly ridiculous.  \n\nNerves were making her fingers tingle and Neira rubbed her fingertips together to keep from feeling the clamminess of her palms. A wave of heat crept up her neck and the prickling was a crackle in her ears. She could almost hear the flush on her skin and the vibration of her heartbeat grew louder. Her mouth was going dry and Neira forced a swallow and a deep breath.  \n\n\"You can't do shit like this, Paul. It wasn't cute ten years ago and it sure as *fuck* isn't cute now.\"  \n\nHer voice was a brittle snap in the quiet of her condo living room and the pop between her shoulder blades eased the tension that was locking up her spine. Life as a single twenty-something was fairly bland, all things considered. While numerous horror stories flipped through her head before purchasing her first home, she never considered something like this. Paul Merriman had broken into her home and was currently sitting in her favorite chair as if he lived with her. He'd aged the way one does from high school into adulthood: The last vestiges of growing pains had melted away and his face was a little more sharp, more in focus than the awkward bits of roundness he had as a teenager. His brow was more prominent; furrowed in confusion that reminded her of the last time she'd snapped at him the day they broke up. Even after all this time, he still didn't get that these gestures were anything but romantic or welcome or even friendly.  \n\n\"Neira, you're not getting--\"\n\nShe surged forward and got into his space, looming over him with teeth gnashing. \"*You broke into my house!*\" She feels the heated sting in the corner of her eyes and the shaking of her hands begins to start. \"You broke into my house and you scared me! How do you not *fucking get it?*\" Her hair was sticking to the back of her neck. She'd worked so hard on it today with the rare surge of motivation to curl her hair and put on a little makeup and now the pink and blue curls of her hair were starting to stick to the back of her neck.  \n\nThere was no knowing what Paul would do. There was no knowing if he'd kill her or attack her so regardless of the outcome, she would not take this quietly. \"Neira, I just came to check on you. I'm sorry--\"\n\n\"No. No, you don't get to fucking talk.\" She backed away out of his reach while Paul's thin lips gaped in confusion and his jaw clenched in frustration. He'd never hit her and he wasn't so much bigger than her, but there was the air of insecurity between them when they dated. Young and stupid and unknowing, there were gestures that at first seemed sweet and romantic until Neira began listening to her gut.  \n\nDetailing her car for her when she was stressed out about finals wasn't the problem. The problem had been that he had made a copy of her keys in order to do it. Tapping on her second story bedroom to come in wasn't a problem. The problem was that he'd taken the screen off, opened it, and she woke up in a cold, gasping sweat to see her boyfriend in her room there and 'ready to comfort her' because she told him she'd had nightmares recently. Small gestures and actions began to add up as he inserted himself into her life to the point where Neira couldn't be sure if he was trying to puppet her, confuse her, or what.\n\nPaul gets up out of the chair and Neira takes another breath and keeps her eyes trained on him. He's taller than her by a good five inches, but she's heavier than he is, and she can use that to her advantage. \"I wanted to offer you a place to stay, you know? 'Cause I'm really sorry a-and... fuck... I fucked up. But, dude, come on! I can set you up somewhere really nice, okay? I'm just trying to say sorry--\"\n\nHis words are cut off by the crash of the front door and Neira backpedals away from him, arms in the air as SWAT bursts in to swarm the room. Paul's eyes grow wide and she realizes that he truly didn't think anything would come from this. He'd never hurt her, but he scared her. He'd always scared her and not once did he ever listen.  \n\n&gt; This is the first prompt I've ever done here and I did this all on the fly. Thank you!",

I'm here to see Lucinda.\"\n\n\"There ain't no Lucinda here.\"\n\n\"Check again.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you heard me - I said -\"\n\nI cut him off. \"I don't believe you heard me correctly. I'm here to see Lucinda. That she is here was told to me by an associate of yours named Louis Left-sack. He then proceeded to jump off the Southwark Bridge, so I have good cause to believe he told me the truth.\"\n\n\"Now why would Louie Left-sack jump off a bridge?\"\n\n\"Not entirely sure. All I know is after he and his crew roughed me up, and then confirmed my name, he decided he was as good as dead, and Lucinda has something to do with it.\"\n\n\"What's that name again?\"\n\n\"Jace Malone.\"\n\n\"If there was a Lucinda here, and I ain't saying there is, how would you know her?\"\n\n\"Thirteen years ago, she did a year at a high school called Rosati-Kain in a small suburb of Saint Louis, Missouri.\"\n\n\"I'll be back in a minute. Don't you do anything funny.\"\n\n\"If I wanted to walk in, I know you wouldn't stop me.\"\n\n\"What makes you think that, bruv?\"\n\n\"Because in the last three days, I've caused a fatal car wreck, two suicides by gun, one by cop, and one by a jump off the Southwark Bridge. They finally listen to me when I say who I am, and that I have some connection to Lucinda, then they make a phone call, then they make the decision to kill themselves. Do you want to be lucky number seven, or do you want to go inside and ask questions first?\"\n\n\"I'll be right back.\"\n\nApproximately two minutes, a different man, skinny, but elegant - slightly older, who reminded me a bit of Michael Caine, in that way that Michael Caine can be both a serial killer and a butler, and you think the serial killer will serve you tea, and the butler will slice you to ribbons came outside.\n\n\"I'm very sorry for our doorman. Please come in, Mister Malone. Miss Clarke has been waiting for your arrival.\"\n\n\"I'm sure she has. Interesting method of getting me here.\"\n\n\"Struggle without value is suffering. Value without struggle is meaningless. Only when you struggle and obtain value, is meaning found.\"\n\n\"Action without thought is chaos. Thought without action is dreaming. Only action derived from thought is positive force exerted.\"\n\nA woman's voice cut through the moment - \n\n\"When one applies positive force in search of meaning, all things are possible. Good to see you remember that, Jace.\"\n\n\"I'm the one that read it to you - that evening after the dance.\"\n\n\"I remember. We have much to discuss. Are you two going to come inside, or just stand around holding your dicks?\"\n\nWith that, I entered the boudoir of Lucinda Clarke, who had in five years taken her father's West End street gang, and built an international crime syndicate the world over. The Kumicho of the Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi, The 415 of Shanghai Triad, The Dragon Head of Hong Kong, The Boss of the Lucchese and Bonnano crime families in the US, the Vor of the Solntsevskaya Bratva, and the General of the Mai-Mai all pledged fealty and somewhere between 10 and 25 percent of their income to her. I didn't know actually know that yet. The Lucinda I knew was a gawky girl with a posh accent who liked when I talked to her about Asian philosophy and science. She had a list of people who were under her protection. Transgressors who harmed even a hair on the people on her list would be subject to her justice. And I was #11 on that list, and it was time to find out why.",

We were there because we needed somehow to split our joint bank account after our divorce.\"  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nThe officer nods. \"Is it correct also that while the bank was being robbed and everyone else was getting shot, you were ushured into the back room to.. 'sit it out'? Am I correct in this assumption?\"  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\"Yes.\"  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\"Do you know why? Are you connected to the Abonici in any way?\"  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\"I don't know exactly why I was unharmed. And I remember having a girlfriend named Agatha Abonici in highschool.\"\n_____  \nThe weirdest thing after the small layover at the station was how... civil it was. No \"good cop, bad coop\", or tied to a chair and spat on. No cuffs, either. Was a rather plesant experince, despite.  \nMakes you think.  \n_____  \nSupprisingly, finding *who* Abonici was was rather different than meeting the syndacite in person. They had a sparse yet easily-traceable digital fingerprint, and acctually finding out *what* Aconici was was the hardest. Turns out they're a crime syndacte, and that cute Aggie was the daughter and heiress - now leader - of it. As a kind gentalman said to me as he pointed out the way to the local dive where they hang out said: 'they've gots morales, see? They don't harm no-one on their do-not-harm list. Nobody gonin' go hurt 'em cause they're got the people, and the honour. Don't get on their bad side, they can (pardon my french miss) fuck you up 100 ways to sunday and no knowing who finds your body'.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nI got there, and everybody stood up almost immediently. They knew who I was, despite me not knowing what the fuck was going on. Shocked, I was. A big, shithouse-sized man stood on a table and bellowed: \"RIGHT! YOU LOT HERE, WE'VE GOT A HARMLESS HERE. NO BEING SHITTY TO HARMLESS, AND NO MESSIN' ARROUND! ANY LEERS AND PEVERTS WILL BE KICKED OUT! AM I CLEAR?\"  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nA general murmer of *yes Mac* and *yessir* and *alright* went through the men and women here and they went back to their games and drinks. The barman went back to cleaning a glass and stared at me like I had two heads. I tried to avoid the gaze, but I wanted information, and bit the bullet and went up.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nHe says to me \"So. You're a Harmless. What do you want? It's on the house.\"",

If you're wondering what happened on the day of the latest job, we're apologetic about it.\"  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\"Ah. Well, that's what I was here about. Why was I not harmed? Everybody else in the bank died.\"  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nthe barman looks at me sternly. \"Tell me no secrets and I'll tell you no lies. Come to the back.\" He disapears, and I follow him down an increasingly complex and twisty building plan, that obviously was not up to code and still be in the same building. We finaly stop after what feels like hours at a small corridor with a single door at the end of it.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nThe barman shakes my hand. \"Go trough that door if you want to know why. God bless you, miss. It's an honour serving one of the bosse's harmless. Aieu.\" and leaves. The door is unguarded. Probably thought some unlucky bastard would've gotten lost before now.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nTaking a deep breath, I go through the door.  \n____  \nWhat finds me, is what I didn't expect. A desk and a secratary, and some huge guards with AK's and ammo belts. The secratary perks up at my entrance.  ",

What caught me off guard was how *hot* and *beautiful* and *stunning* she had grown to be.

            "comment": "(So having written this, I realise I've cocked up the bank robbery part. I'm not changing a thing because 1st drafts for life!)\n\nI've been chasing this cunt for half an hour and I'm way passed fucking pissed. \n\nOffically I'm meant to let tossers like this go, endangering public safety and all, be a good London Met Officer, but I couldn't care less anymore. Walkie out the window, it's been just me and him for the last five minutes.\n\nThat cop-killing bastard. \n\nThis is why we need guns. He killed George and instead of doing me in which would have been smart, he stops. He had me on my knees and I can still feel the kiss of the hot steel on my forehead. Un-fucking-forgivable.\n\nMy eyes were closed. It's the most scared I've ever been; pretty hard to maintain composure when your entire vision focuses on the black in that barrel. \n\n\"What's your name?\" A quiver's in his voice. I wouldn't be surprised if he'd pissed himself back there.\n\n\"Who. Are. You?\" he asked this time with what I can only assume was meant to be authority. \n\nPussy.\n\n\"I am PC Ellen Summers.\"  \n\nPussy.\n\n\u201cFuck\u201d he shouted.  I opened my eyes and he's started to leg it out the house.  I stepped over George who lay staring at the sealing, his blood pooling at the hole in his crown. \n\nCan't help the dead though, right? He'd understand. Vengeance.\n\nSo why do i feel bad?\n\nI gave chase. If we were in America I could have shot him in his back there and then. \n\nSo why do I feel bad?\n\nSituation radioed, residents awakened and panicked, engines roared, tires screeched, and here we fucking are. \n\nDeep down, I know I'm having fun and I shouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe Bambridge Estate. He's hops out and runs into the maze of flats. He's fucked up only he probably doesn't know how badly.  I grew up here. \n\nBy the time I've hopped a couple fences I'm on him. Just before he reaching the south entrance too.  I aim to drop kick him from up high but only end up flopping onto him. A takedown's a takedown, i'll take it.  \n\nRolling on the floor and I smash him with what ever wherever.  Mounting him is easy and i start raining blows but as angry as I feel, I'm getting bored. Why the fuck isn't he hitting back?\n\nWe're breathing heavy and I'm just staring this cunt-face. He's peering back through his guard but he doesn't say shit.  I'm thinking I should ram his skull into the pavement but his phone rings. It's a unique ringtone, one i know I've heard before but can't place.\n\nHe spits out blood from the side of his mouth. \"It's gonna be for you.  Inside jacket.\" \n\nHe separates his guard so I can get at his pocket. I find his gun holstered so i take that as well, for safety more than evidence at this point.  Something feels off.\n\nWhy am I actually doing this? Just fuck the bitch up a bit longer - for George - then bring him to the station and let the boys unload.  Once again, curiosity gets the better of me. \n\n\"I DIDN'T HURT HER\" he shouts into the night. \n\nWhat a lovely opportunity to hit him right in throat. He stops shouting and writhes until I playfully rest the barrel of the gun on his cheek.\n\nThe phone doesn't display a number. It just rings that annoyinly familiar tone.  I answer it.\n\n\"Let the boy go, Ellie. He can't hurt you.\"\n\nI hate it when all I hear is the blood rushing through my veins. Whenever you think you've escape your past,  it turns out you just didnt run fast enough.\n\n\"Ellie?\" I say indignant as fuck. \"Who the fuck are you?\" Composer's easy to maintain when you're pretending you've nothing to be sorry for.\n\n\"Thanks for that, Ellie. Being forgettable's always nice.\" The voice hesitates. \"Look, I think I'm gonna come down, just don't rough the kid up anymore. It's not like he's gonna hurt you.\"\n\nI want to say 'don't' but he hangs up before I get the chance. \n\nComposure, Ellie. I shove the scum onto his stomach. Knee in the spine, handcuffs out, \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Mark\" he yelps as I yank an arm.\n\n\"Surname?\"\n\nThe door of the south entrance flies open and from a warm pool of light steps Jermaine Daniels.  \n\nMy first love. We were inseparable growing it was only a matter of time before those feeling blossomed and they bloomed it was amazing.\n\nAnd I went and cocked that up in the most horrific way.\n\nIt feels like an eternity in which i recall how every second of just being in his company.  Bliss. \u2018Jermaine, I've missed you so much\u2019 I long to say but the moment of course gets and ruined by him being a dick and laughing. Men.\n\"The universe is fucking cruel don't you think?  I'm mean this scene, this scene right here it's eerlie fucking familiar, except this time it's you doing the straddling and performing the cruelties.\" \n\nHe's right. It's funny, the universe is mean, and I deserve that.\n\n\"Fuck you, Jermaine.\"\n\n\"No, fuck you, Ellie.\"\n\nWe just stare at each other like we're playing a game. I want to talk to him. To say... everything?  Nothing?  I don't know what or even where to fucking to begin. 'Sorry' happens to be sitting on my tongue yet its the furthest word from my mind.\n\n\"Guv, get 'er off\" Mark groans. My knee's still in his back. It's staying there.  For George.\n\n\"Shut up, Mark. Let me and Ellie talk.\u201d\n\nI close my eyes.  \"It's been a long time.\"\n\n\"Fifteen years on September twenty-sixth.\"\n\nThat stings, enough for me to take a sharp in take of breathe.  He remembers the date. I scramble falling back on police training. Emotionless and pragmatic with the dash of gallows humour for good measure. \n\nI aim the gun at him.  He pulls up and way too many laser spots race their way to me. A bunch rest on my heart so i have to assume there's at least one on my head. Nothing to fear, Ellie; not the first time we've been covered with obnoxious dots is it?\n\n\"SHE'S QUITE CLEARLY TOP OF THE FUCKING STAY LIST\" Jermaine roars, his face contorted from sheer rage.  My aim stays true and I take a quick glance down when his face relaxes. No more red dots. Yay.\n\n\"What's going on here, Jermaine?\"\n\n\"Do us both a favour PC Summers; turn around and forget this night ever happened.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Same as always.  You know what you fucking problem is Ellen, you're too fucking stubborn.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know.  You use to tell me a lot, puffing up your chest pretending to be mad. I\u2019d come tickle if it weren\u2019t for this gun.\u201d\n\nHe chuckles. Kind of unexpected response there. \u201cI\u2019m sorrrrmmme kind of dick. I\u2019m processing every and... You.... Know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d  He sighs shaking his head. \"This could bring about the end of everything I\u2019ve worked for but I don\u2019t really care \u2013\u201c\n\n\u201cGuv?!  No!\u201d Mark interrupts.\n\n\u201cMark, for fucks sake.  Ellie, would you mind working your knee a little bit?\u201d \n\nHow promising!  I happily oblige and Mark squirms and growls. He tenses like he wants to get up and whack me one so I crank his arm a teeny bit. He settles down. I pat him on his head like a good little boy.\n\n\u201cYou remember when we were kids we came up a plan to save the planet? This is the adult version in progress.  The list I mentioned is a list of those who are not to be harmed under any circumstance and you are at the top. Unfortunately it seems you interrupted Mark while on a mission to spy and acquire blackmail material on several prominent MPs so we'll have to delay on that.\u201d\n\nI laugh. \u201cOh, come on!  A secret hive of global villainy?  You should call yourselves the Lame Onanists of London, I mean fucking hell.  Or better yet, just COCKS cause that\u2019s what you are?  Be real with me, Jay, what\u2019s really going on?  You can\u2019t change the world from a shitty council estate in Catford.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly why it working.\u201d And I realise he\u2019s deadly serious.  \u201cNot to mention, the hood techs are brilliant. What they\u2019ll do for a bit of halloumi cheese and avocado. I mean Russian bots, fucking hilarious? Putin\u2019s cool with it now but the heat we're gonna bring is gonna thaw Siberia.\u201d\n\u201cNukes?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not, don\u2019t be silly. The heat's completely metaphorical.\u201d\n\nOkay, this is weird. I\u2019m relaxing but my anger\u2019s rising. \u201cDo you know what disrupting the status quo like that will fucking mean?  People will die.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave died. I\u2019m completely aware of the impact, Ellie.\u201d\n\nGeorge. For a moment I forgot.

You'll be out in five any way.\u201d\n\nMark relaxes entirely.  In fact he gives up his other arm to cuff.\n\n\u201cWhat made you like this, Jay?  How?\u201d\n\u201cYou, Ellie.  You broke me. I never let you know it but you really did. And then mum and dad passed, and I didn\u2019t have anything to live for. I didn\u2019t want to die, or specifically I didn\u2019t want to kill myself so I thought 'fuck it, let's make a different better world or die trying'.\u201d\n\nI think I\u2019m crying.  My cheeks are tickling and they feel wet and warm.  \u201cMy career's over.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen join us\u201d, he pleads.  \u201cJoin me.\u201d\n\nHe steps forward unafraid of the gun.  \u201cOne more step and I\u2019m gonna blow you away.\u201d  Please take another step.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t and I\u2019m left disappointed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a police office. I protect the status quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut your career?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs over, yeah I know.  Unless I bring you in.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless you bring me in.\u201d  Jermaine laughs.  \u201cYou know what my biggest problem is, Ellie?  I never stopped loving you.\u201d\n\nThe laser dots race towards me once again.  \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Jay. Your biggest problem is that you\u2019ve never been able to hurt me, especially when I\u2019ve ask for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSTAND DOWN\u201d, Jermaine roars at the sky. It\u2019s a futile gesture. His plan's grown too big for one person.  We\u2019re already dead, we were both too stubborn to live anyway.\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Hi. I'm Kayuto Kagama. In high school I was the one who was beat up for money until I stopped bringing it to school. They still beat me up but at least I wasn't losing money. I was the tech nerd back then and still am. In high school there was this girl named Akari who had a crush on me. She kinda stalked me and gave me chocolate every year for valentines. This never got annoying but I was bullied because she was the cutest girl in school and I was the nerd. Oh, I forgot to say that her father was one of the Yakuza higher ups. After high school I got a good job at a tech company in Fukuoka and didn't see her again... until now. \n\nI was at a bank cashing my paycheck when 8 guys held us at gunpoint. \"Let's check and see if anyone here is on the list.\" Said guy 1. \"Why should we do that?\" Says guy 5. \"We don't want what happened to Kayuga happen to us.\" Said guy 7. 3 of the guys started going around checking to see if anyone was on the list. When they got to me guy 4 said:\"Hey guys. This guy is wanted by Akari, alive. We'd better take him to her.\" \"Me?!\" Said I. \"Yes you,\" says guy 6. They finished the robbery while everyone looked at me funny. After finishing and grabbing some coffee from the break room they put a bag over my head and shoved me into a car.\n\nThe car ride was about 2 hours long and the seats were quite comfortable. The guys in the car were talking about previous robberies and stuff but I barely listened. We stopped and they took me out of the car. When they took the bag off of my head I saw that I was in a hangar. It was very clean and very white. I then saw a cute girl at a table. \"Akari?\" I said. \"Yup that's me.\" Said Akari. Let me get something out of the way before I continue. Akari speaks kinda playfully. This may make her seem childish but she really isn't. She ran up to hug me and whispered in  my ear:\"I've been waiting for you.\"\n\nPart 2 coming when I get 10 up votes on this.",

They start holding people in small groups, waving their guns around. One of them made a contact with me, his eyes opened wide, his gun aimed at me, i stared him down, now all of them looked at me, and slowly backed away like a pack of raptors when challenged by a T-rex.\nI caught a whiff of something, a scent, females robbing the bank?\nThe leader kept her gun pointed at me, while the other stuff their bags with cash, a confused look evident in her eyes.\nThose eyes seem familiar, like i had looked at them many times before.\n\nOne of the robbers grabbed her by the shoulder and said let's go then looked at me while running out of bank door.\nAnd in an instant, gone.\nAll that work casing out this bank ruined.\n\nMy phone buzzed and i opened a message.\n\"You shouldn't have come here Frank. I can't promise to keep you safe forever.\"\nThe number's unlisted and probably be burnt, but i know who it is.\n",

            "comment": "I arrive at the building my old friend told me his office was at and find myself looking up at a towering skyscraper piercing into the sky of Anchorage, Alaska. I duck my head down, put my hands in my winter jacket as I feel the cold biting on my fingertips, and enter the building. \nImmediately, I am face to face with a six foot two hundred pound plus Pacific Islander security guard, whose desk is in the large arctic entry with the second doors right behind him.\n\n\"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, my friend Killian works here. I'm Mika, an old friend of his,  I was trying to see him about something...\"\n\n \"Ok\", he says as he starts scanning a paper on his desk.\n\"Ah! I need to ask you a challenge question before I'm allowed to let you in, hope you don't mind?\"\n\nI indicate that I don't mind and he grunts. \n\n\"Alright. When and where did you first have sex with Killian?\"\n\n\"Really!? That's the question?\" I ask, flustered. \n\nHe holds up a slip of paper that does indeed have that question on it.\n\n\"Fine. We meet at University at the Halloween dance the campus freshman dorms put on and we danced. We clicked and were having a grand time with each other. One thing led to another and he took me to his dorm room where we did the deed. Can I see my friend now?\"\n\nHe grunts, presses a button, the doors behind him open and he nods towards them.\n\nI smile, quickly walking by him and see that he has never moved his right arm from under the desk, darting further inside the building. \n\nKillian had said that if I ever visited him here, be prepared and that his office was the top floor.\n\nI stared at the scene in front of me as I looked around. It was one big atrium with giant glass ceilings and all around different vegetation grew in the courtyard I found myself in. There were a few people milling about and others sitting at tables out here.\n\nI found the elevator and made my way over to it. I presses the up button and waited. Up on arriving, it opened to reveal two white Russian guys, or at least that's what I assumed with the track suit getup and their physical characteristics, both with assault rifles on their shoulders. \n\n\"Miss, which floor you want?\"\n\n\"Top floor.\" I squeaked.\n\n\"Hmmm. Your name and business with boss?\"\n\n\"Mika. I'm a friend of his and needed to talk to him.\"\n\nHe looks at the other guy,  who had stayed quiet, who nods to the questioner after listening to his earpiece.\n\nHe waves me into the elevator which is wide and deep enough for a couch to fit without having to turn or tilt it if sideways.\n\nI step into it and he presses the button for the top floor after the other guy puts the elevator key in and turns it.\n\nWe ride up to the top in silence, giving me plenty of time to stare at my reflection.  The bell dings and the doors open.\n\nThere is Killian, standing with a huge grin on his face. \n\n\"Mika! It's so lovely to see you again. What brings you to pay a visit on your old friend?\"\n\n\"I was at a robbery yesterday. The robbers said I'm on some kind of no kill list. I wanted to find out how that came to be so I came to visit you.\"\n\nHe nods, takes my hand and takes us to a couch in front of a huge window overlooking the entire city. \n\n\"Please don't abuse it. Only a select few are granted such a thing and it is only good as long as I'm around. I did it because I still love you and don't want you to die from some idiot shooting people.\"\n\nI blush and look away for a moment.\n\n\"I don't know what to say...thank you.\"\n\nHe nods and then I hear glass being hit and look out to see a bullet having just hit the window. Three more quickly follow, then a fourth and I feel blood spraying across my face.\n\nI look over in horror to see glazed eyes and a hole in Killian's head...",

            "comment": "There was nothing worse than going to the bank at this time, but for Scarlet there was no other option. As she stood impatiently behind a horde of slowly shuffling zombies she prayed for something interesting to happen to take her mind off of the dull eyes of the staff or the irritating calls of \"Can I speak to your manager?\" every time the customer's demands weren't met exactly and immediately.\n\nExcitement soon did come in the form of a group of men in ski masks waving assault rifles around without much care for what they were doing.\n\n\"EVERYBODY GET DOWN NOW!\" The leader commanded and fired a shot at the cieling to emphasise what would happen to anyone foolish enough to resist.\n\nEveryone quickly fell to the floor and Scarlet shook as she got down as well while the robbers went to collect the cash. As they did this Scarlet reached slowly for her phone hoping to call the cops in case the silent alarm had yet to be triggered. Unfortunately she hadn't been so subtle and a gun was now pointing at her.\n\n\"DO YOU WANT TO DIE?!\" He shouted at her and walked up closer, his finger was on the trigger as he looked into her eyes... and froze.\n\nThen he began to back away, he dropped the gun and it clattered to the ground getting the attention of the others. One by one they turned to see what had him so scared. When they saw Scarlet they froze in fear. \n\n\"Um w-what are you doing?\" Scarlet asked confused as they acted as if she was some kind of bomb.\n\n\"Look just please tell Mr Harper we didn't mean to bother you!\" One guy said before they turned and ran. Right as the police were arriving.\n\nThey were arrested and the police escorted the hostages out of the building and began taking care of calming them down. Meanwhile  Scarlet could only think of that name.\n\n\nHarper...\n\nMark Harper? Couldn't be. Could it? He had been Scarlet's first love and first heart break when he had to move away. Something had just clicked in a way they hadn't with any other guy. The idea that he could have scared these trigger happy thieves seemed impossible.\n\nBut maybe a visit was still in order...",

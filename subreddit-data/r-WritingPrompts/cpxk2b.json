I've aimed it at a regular pulsar 0.214 galactic radii away.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Alright, lets calibrate on that to start.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe terminal in front on the two Nuf'Rik began showing a data feed, a regular radio pulse showed in the spectroscopic analysis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Wonderful. I'm showing a quintuple aught reduction in background noise over the previous filter. What's that put us at now?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"We could pick up a weak rotating red dwarf on the other edge of the universe with that. The Cerulean Luminaries will be ecstatic. Lets finish this up, you did the null test with the blackbox right?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Yes, I'll point it at an empty area of the sky to get general background reads for what's left.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe display switched to showing static as the spectroscope moved to position. When it finished the static dropped and an analysis of several digital and analog signals began displaying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hold on, let me see what's wrong.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'lat held it's paw on a glowing circular orb and the display started flickering through settings and analyses. The display showed a slight change in the aim of the Spectroscope and the signal cleared further while several more lit up with activity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"This doesn't seem right, it's showing the signal as coming from the galaxy cluster near the empty zone, I adjusted the aim and it's confirming it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"So? That doesn't sound odd. Just some civilization there blasting out signals, can't you clean it up?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"No, that shouldn't be possible. That galactic cluster is over 2 million galactic radii away. The other stations in the network are confirming it's the source.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Sentient life has only been around for about half that time. I see what you are saying Juk'Lat. Alright just pass it through the decoder, it'll be jibberish. It's interesting but its probably some odd galactic phenomena from the early universe we'll want to study.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe displays shifted to a decode stream, passing the signal through advanced language cipher decoding and data format detection algorithms. Suddenly a simple display came up with a primitive 2 dimensional video feed. In it were translated numbers, the first... 100 primes. An odd choice. Below was the table of elements and a graph of the base subatomic particles, a few were missing, the ones harder to detect. A motion video began playing next to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"... Back from break. Thanks Dave, here at the top of the hour we pass you over to Jill, who will discuss the latest developments on Hurricane Patty...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Why hasn't anyone else discovered this before?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The transmissions likely didn't last long, like every other primitive civilization. By the time any other sentient life arose you would need a long range spectroscope of this power and sensitivity pointed almost directly at them, AND be in the thin shell of the transmissions.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHun'Duq had to collect it's thoughts before snapping back to reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Juk'Lat. I need you to stay here, I need to go on the official line.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Who are you calling?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Luminous Prism Yol'Vir.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly everyone was interested in the signals. In these 'Humans'. They were supposed to be impossible. There were barely a handful of rocky planets in existence at the time. The universe was still full of massive blue giants generating supernovae at an apocalyptic rate. The conditions to allow a sentient species was thought to be impossible. So many things would have to go right. In about the time it took to finish reading the news the military was ***INTENSELY*** interested in a potentially ancient sentient race and their technological marvels and advancements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Human Manifold Project to build the spatial tunnel to their Milky Way galaxy would have bankrupted an entire sector of star systems if everyone in the galactic cluster hadn't insisted on being part of the project. Everyone wanted to be able to have a communications channel with the humans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHun'Duq had gotten so many promotions Juk'Lat had forgotten what title was even the current one anymore. Juk'Lat was now Turquoise Juk'Lat, so that was awesome too. Plus Juk'Lat got to be on the discovery team, perks of being the first to find the signal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe anticipation was almost too much to bear when the ship passed into the center of the Manifold Transmitter. The device spun up, causing the space to warp into a bubble before it was cut off almost completely from the outside, blackness surrounding the ship, connected only at a single point to the rest of the universe. The transmitter then bent the 4 dimensional universe until the space the Milky Way galaxy occupied bumped into the bubble. As soon as it made contact the transmitter cut off the bubble, causing it to snap back at the only point of contact with the rest of the universe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA new sky snapped into view. They had arrived.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(To be continued)",

It was blue, with green landmasses. A brilliant yellow star was in the background, and even from this distance, thin threads of a massive megastructure could be seen orbiting around it, and a few, piercing into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe command deck burst into chaos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA remote spatial bubble manifold. No one had thought it was possible. Yet the results were clear. The aftermath was not. They were greeted with silence. After a few of the days of the planet below had elapsed, a clearer picture was beginning to form.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"As you can see from this analysis, the superstructure is attracting iron and other heavy elements out of the core, and is replacing them with new hydrogen fuel. It appears to be maintaining the star in it's mid-life period. This would be consistent with the data we collected about the human home system. The other planets in this system are labeled by their human names.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I see this planet is the only one with a stabilizing satellite in orbit and in the liquid water band of the star.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You are correct Imperator. It is thought large moons were rare in the earlier stages of the universe. This entire system is like looking into the past. Enormous amounts of resources are sustaining it and keeping it static.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'Lat pulled up a mapping of the planet before continuing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"In addition, our deep scans of the surface revealed a facility at this location. An island chain. It links into a subterranean network of facilities that we are hypothesizing is a global computational and resource delivery network.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Imperator looked at the data available and contemplated for several moments in silence before making a decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Alright, send in the ground team. We are assuming non-hostility. If they wanted to attack us they would have already done it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe facility was located within a thick tropical rainforest on the island, though it was easy to spot, the spire jutting from the terrain over twice the height of the dormant volcano that formed the island eons ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ground team found itself staring at a monolithic steel gray wall, the base of the structure having been reached with little fanfare. Knocking didn't seem to do anything. Over a day passed as the team discussed options and failed at many of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Wait. when we first heard their signals they transmitted the first 100 prime numbers. They considered it important. Perhaps they use it as a measuring stick of intentional signalling, since it doesn't happen in nature?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'Lat thought the idea was worth mentioning, and at this point any idea sounded like a good one. They set up a light to emit pulses, and programming it to do pauses while flashing to spit out prime numbers in order.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt worked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Greetings Sapient Beings. Welcome to Earth.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe noise was heard from behind them, said in the galactic common trade language. Upon spinning around was a Human, of the female phenotype, hovering above the ground as if standing on air. Juk'Lat completely forgot first contact protocols and just blurted out the first thing he thought of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You can understand us?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Yes. I have been listening to you since you first came to this galaxy. I apologize for the abrupt transition here. I felt it would be more expedient to just bring you to your destination than force you to find it.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'Lat reminded itself of it's mission and reoriented. Juk'Lat clapped it forepaws together and held them there for a moment before spreading them apart in a line and crouching slowly before rising again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hello, I am Turquoise Juk'Lat of the Nuf'Rik. We have come to learn about the human species.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe human placed it's bare forepaw to it's lower torso and bent forward, looking as if it was about to tip over before straightening back up. It's mouth stretched wide. It was a rather odd thing to look at. Then again, the Gurblucada had to take the win for weirdest species ever so it wasn't that bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Well met Juk'Lat. I am Quintessence Alpha. An amalgamation of the human mind and spirit. If you would like, you may call me Quin for short. I would again like to welcome you to Earth. This is the home planet of the human race. It is now considered a historical preserve, and the nexus of the human civilization.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuin motioned to the wall, where an opening slid open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Please, let us speak inside. I am sure you have many questions.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n(To be continued)",

It was a short walk to a platform further in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Please step onto the platform, I will transport us to the welcome center further below. You may experience mild discomfort as I adjust the pressure within the bubble to match atmospheric pressure below.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You can do that?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Yes, it is a simple matter of compressing the bubble before snap-back.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'Lat was trying to wrestle with this concept, it was widely accepted as impossible, yet the results once again spoke for themselves. The pressure increased slightly and suddenly they were in a corridor. This technology would revolutionize logistics planetside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe corridor was wide and well lit. Their host remained silent as the group walked with her. Along the walls were depictions of what Juk'Lat assumed was early humans. Their history mimicked many other species. Crouching humans making fire. A human cultivating the plantlife of the world. Humans building cities. Humans waging war. A triumphant human-shaped armored suit stepping onto their moon. A human spaceship jumping through a Manifold Transmitter. Humans building up new worlds. A human welcoming a human attired in garb from an earlier panel. This one was strange.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What does this one depict? Quin?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***This is a depiction of one of humanity's greatest triumphs. It was called the Lazarus Program, an effort to rebirth the people who had died throughout history and give them a new life now that war, disease, and poverty had been eliminated in humanity's journey through the cosmos.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe very thought of such an undertaking seemed nonsensical. It shouldn't even be possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"How did they do that?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Time is an inviolate record of all that has ever happened. Once you understand higher dimensional mechanics, it is possible to read it like a book, or watch it like a movie. The minds of each deceased person can be scanned and recreated, their bodies made whole, their ailments eliminated. This was the goal of the Lazarus Program.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few moments to recover from this revelation, Juk'Lat realized there was one question more important than any other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"And where is everyone now? I don't see any other humans here. This whole system seems to be running without any indication of where everyone went or where the materials sustaining this place and it's sun come from.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***An astute observation. You will meet several people shortly. They are eager to finally meet another sapient species. From the data I have gathered it was a mistake to so thoroughly control the planets of this galaxy. Most sapient species ignore galaxies with no intelligent life detected.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuin paused an made a short huffing noise before continuing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***I suppose it did not occur to anyone that human activity would not be detected eventually. Your species appear to have fallen into a logical fallacy on a universal scale. You assumed that if no one had figured it out yet, that it wasn't possible. Simple chance dictated it. Humanity had no one to compare themselves with. They assumed if it hadn't been done it was because they hadn't figured it out yet.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe rounded a corner and stopped in front of a circular doorway standing in the middle of an open hallway. It shimmered for a moment before a view of a grassy plain snapped into view, a large, comfortable looking home was nestled between trees with a garden and a pond out in front.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***To answer your question, humanity has transitioned to living within bubble universes, of a sort. The advancement of spatial and temporal manipulation has allowed them to place entire systems within pockets of space. They spend their time with their families, and when they decide to, creating new worlds, new universes, and entertaining themselves with games and contests.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe motioned through the doorway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Beyond is a pocket universe containing the home of Dr. Ustenberger, the director of SETI, a program that has persisted since the early days of civilization. Looking for you. There are a few others gathered as well, they did not wish to alarm you with a crowd. Would you care to meet them?***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'Lat was fairly certain absolutely no one would believe him back home if it weren't for an entire team witnessing the same thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA feeling of euphoria washed over Juk'Lat upon realizing this was just the beginning. A whole new universe of possibilities awaited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'Lat stepped through the door, and into the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(To be continued)",

Apparently confusion is universal because the human waved a holographic UI into existence before pressing a button and waving it away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Right, it's probably better when the translator is turned on rather than off. Sorry about that. My name is Dr. Ustenburger, I am the director for the SETI program. It is an honor to meet each of you!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'Lat was a bit taken aback by the courteousness of the human. Here they were, virtual lords of the universe, and they were honored to meet a Turquoise of all people? Let it not be said Juk'Lat did not pay back the respect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'Lat placed it's right paw over the left and rotated them 90 degrees as if to shield it's torso, then pulled it's paws apart, leaving the torso exposed before crouching and rising again, the deepest form of respect permitted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe man repeated Juk'Lat's motions before sticking it's right paw equivalent out in front of itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***It is called a 'handshake' you grasp the other's hand firmly and shake up and down a bit as a welcoming greeting.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuin's prompt was useful, Juk'Lat and the rest of the ground team repeated the gesture to the human, and introduced themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Okay, so let me introduce you to the team. Over here is our xenoculture researcher Dr. Faouliste, our xenobiologist Dr. Miller, and one of our founders, Dr. Sagan.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe introductions went smoothly. Everyone was seated or provided a cushion or wrapping pole as appropriate. Water was given to everyone, since it is the one liquid everyone could consume safely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I will be honest, I am somewhat confused as to why we are meeting you first. We typically meet with government leaders when making first contact. Is there a reason for this?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Yes, I suppose. Our government structure is very... diffuse. There are people who lead projects, but most of the management is left to the Quintessences, if anyone needs or wants anything it can be provided by them, and disputes have well established methods of resolution. As the team leading the SETI program, it was our privilege to welcome you. We had mostly given up hope of ever finding other life. It seems we were a bit foolish in that regard.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It was pure luck that led us to you. I must admit, all of this is a bit overwhelming. We didn't think we would find any intelligent life from so early in the history of the universe. No one though it was possible. If I may ask, just how long ago did your civilization arise?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDr. Ustenburger fidgeted in his seat before turning to Quin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Should we tell them?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Yes. It would be unethical to deceive them at first contact. Juk'Lat, to answer your question, the answer is roughly 487 quintillion years ago.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'Lat did a double take.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Ah.. is there a translation error?, you said quintillion, that is many many times longer than the age of the universe.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Yes, it is. We have restarted the universe many times, tweaking the constants slightly each time, hoping to find life. We did not expect to succeed so completely on this iteration.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDr. Sagan spoke up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I once stated that survival is the exception, extinction the rule. I had no idea at the time how correct I was. We found that most worlds never progressed beyond single cellular life. Multi-cellular organisms almost always produced an initial extinction event that was not survivable. Some form of algae was the most advanced anything got.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'Lat was speechless. Nothing could be said. The humans restarted the universe? A reversal of entropy? It was the most basic unbreakable law of the universe. Juk'Lat could barely croak out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"How?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuin was the one who responded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***You have already seen the technology used. Remote bubble formation, and bubble compression. When applied on a universal scale, one can take the entire universe and crush it back to the size of a subatomic particle. At this point any quantum fluctuation will trigger another 'Big Bang' as we like to call it. The Sol system is shielded in a bubble for each cycle, it is the oldest celestial object known to humanity.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDr. Faouliste decided to add to the conversation, to avoid confusion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The transmission you heard were our efforts at finding other intelligent life. We transmitted our electromagnetic signals for the duration they originally could have been heard at the time period we evolved. We... clearly were not transmitting at the correct time to find anyone.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuk'Lat took a while to let everything sink in. Meanwhile a report scrolled through it's vision, from the military liaison in the ground party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Revised Human Threat Rank: 49*\n\n*Note: This rank is not a proper assessment, but the maximum value in our system. Humans could end the universe whenever they desire. Advise we attempt alliance at any and all costs. See attachments.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"So\", Juk'Lat asked. \"What happens now?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***It is humanity's wish that we all enjoy the bounty of creation.

            "comment": "The monument was smaller than T'rakkar had expected. It was less than ten meters in height, a simple laser-etched plaque in granite. In the first few years it had been built, when the remains of the First World had been discovered, there had been a rush of tourists to the site. The wonders of economics had, within a month, caused a hundred thousand orbiting viewing platforms to spring into existence around the dying white dwarf the First World still orbited, and tickets had been ten times the annual worker's salary. The downside, he mused, to a truly galactic economy; the richest one percent were quadrillions in number. \n\nWhat had it been like, back then? A species confined to one world, gazing at the stars, mere billions strong? A stray meteor, an accidental misalignment of a neutron star all it would take to wipe out all trace of your genetic lineage. The thought made him shudder; he, at least, had left eggs on a score of worlds. With any luck, his legacy would continue on for billions of years to come. \n\nT'rakkar had never considered himself a spiritual person. His colony was a practical minded one, his crechemates likewise focused on material matters. Indeed, their colony produced some of the finest engineers among the T'karan, so he couldn't fault the philosophy. \n\nBut here, in front of a simple plaque on a blasted rock around a dying star, he felt a sense of wonder that hadn't stirred since he was a larva. \n\n\"Hello,\" he read, \"We are the human race. By the time you receive this message, we will be dead. There are many challenges a species must face. By the time you can understand this message, you will have overcome many of them. We hope you had an easier time than we did.\"\n\nIt was a famous passage, from the middle of the Codex. The ancient message passed along through every intelligent species. A fitting inscription for this place, he decided. Every larva had read it a hundred times; but he continued anyway. Sometimes the place the message was received was as important as the message itself.\n\n\"The first challenge you faced was survival. You were born on a world teeming with life, with predators that hunted you, with parasites that weakened you, with diseases that struck you down. We congratulate your ancestors on overcoming a challenge that so few species do, of birthing a race that was strong and smart enough to dominate your world.\n\n\"The second challenge you faced was yourselves. Only the strong survive, and the strong survive by taking from the weak. We congratulate your species on overcoming the tragedy of strength to build a civilization where all members worked together for the good of all.\"\n\nT'rakkar smiled, his antennae curling. Even among a hive species, \"the good of all\" had never been achievable. He wondered what kind of psychology and evolutionary pressures humans must have had to achieve that level of cohesion.\n\n\"The third challenge you face is the world. By the time you can read this message, you will have achieved an understanding of the world strong enough to master it. So too did we. We pass our knowledge to you, for knowledge hoarded is knowledge wasted. We ask that you broadcast this message in its entirety, to ease others suffering as this will ease yours.\n\n\"The fourth challenge you face will be despair. For once you have mastered the world, what else is left? You will be divorced from the cycles your ancestors evolved in. You will face challenges they were never designed to handle. You will be lost, alone, and confused. And you will suffer. \n\n\"You will face many more challenges besides, but we are ashamed to admit we do not know what they are, for we never overcame this one. We achieved a form of paradise on our planet. No human has felt hunger in millennia; no labor has been performed that was not volunteered. And yet our species will die, sooner or later, because we are alone. Because without challenge, there is no meaning to life.\n\n\"We, the authors of this message, call ourselves Arecibo, and we foretell our demise. We send this message as a warning and as a message of hope. Rejoice, because you are not alone. Look up at the stars, and know: we were here. Our existence was preposterously unlikely; our survival even more so. We hope that this message makes any future existence merely unlikely. Look up at the stars, and fear. Look up at the stars, and wonder.\"\n\nHe wondered if humanity knew just how much good their message had done. His own species had been in the middle of a cold war that would likely have lead to their annihilation when they received the Codex. Historians and politicians had argued about exactly what it had done for decades. Had the advanced technology provided simply reduced the resource pressures and averted war? It certainly had reduced tensions, but hives had declared war over lesser things. Had the humans' message of hope truly touched the hearts of their ancestors? Some people found it inspiring; yet T'rakkar had never been among them. The dead were dead, and their society had long since surpassed the humans'. \n\nYet all throughout the galaxy, species had received the Codex, and almost every species that did had survived. \n\nT'rakkar looked up at the stars. He wondered how different they would have looked, otherwise.",

And around this star spun a rock, wiped clean by the star's expansion in the distant past.\n\nFrozen in ice, with a single ring around it, it sent out signals at the speed of light, and had been for billions of years. It was a curiosity, and no amount of excavation had been able to find the signal's source.\n\nThe message was clear: \"We are here! We are here!\" But of the messengers, none remained.\n\nIt was a major discovery to find small objects made of gold, an element known for its stability. Rings, necklaces, even coins buried in various places, far beneath the ice. Around the galaxy, theories were crafted and thrown around like no tomorrow. The best evidence available suggested a civilization created 2-5 billion years before what was previously thought to be the earliest-known lifeform.\n\nBut those small objects were it. There was nothing else. Nothing to else suggest a small sentient species far from the center of galaxy-spanning empires had *been*.\n\nAnd then, decades later, on one of the small orbiting chunks of the planet's ring, the source of the signals was found. A small, rectangular sheet of steel encased in gold, holding a small transmitter. On it were many symbols, writing of some sort. So many academics spent years, decades trying to decipher the message of the First Ones.\n\nAnd when they did, they cried. For it was a message of peace, of accomplishment, of hope. Though the First Ones were alone, and now gone, they had never stopped striving.\n\n\"Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\"",

A hidden remnant cursed to dance over the remains of what it once shielded from harm. Such is the cruelty of nature.\n\nWe do not know what they would have looked like--our excavation efforts are still underway, but the baked soil is laden with mineral and rock, far too noisy to scan beyond. What we do know is that they died long ago, perhaps before any known species ever lived, before the formation of intergalactic searches and the pursuit of new life. Before our coalitions and technological integrations.\n\nBefore any of us.\n\nThey were alone on a budding planet, clawing their way towards greatness. Ruins of what must have once been structures that reached for the stars, monuments to their own feats--we even found traces of their efforts on an orbiting moon, and have hung the unique tapestries in the Iotian Gallery for all to see. Other debris and strange crafts were found drifting through the system, the scattered hopes and dreams of lonely beings desperate for an answer of any kind.\n\nI like to think they would've been our friends. A guiding hand that knows through toiling experience what it means to fight from the soil to the sky, to deliver themselves into the ceaseless stream of fate and scream, \"*We will be heard!*\"\n\nFor this, we remember them. Not as mysteries, but as mentors. Not for their demise, but for their struggle in an impossibly large and unforgiving void without meaning or sense. To think that they perished unsure of their place in this puzzle is wounding.\n\nAnd yet, even in the still-warm corpse of that tragic planet, not all was lost. Hidden among history, there were microbes, and small, arid flora tucked away in the shadows of whatever came before them. A final testament that, against any odds, not even catastrophe can end the virulent cycle of evolution. A rejection of the end in what little way was possible.\n\nThe dying breath of premature gods.\n\n---\n\n*/r/resonatingfury*",

There are other theories out there based on explaining the Fermi Paradox that also make great writing prompts, such as we are in the equivalent of a galactic zoo and aliens are choosing not to interact with us.  In any event, it's the Fermi Paradox that raises some really interesting questions about why we seem to be alone.",

I think eventually we will probably colonize every available moon and planet in this solar system, we might even build a Dyson swarm/ sphere, but for us right now its like we are climbing a mountain, where in front of us is a sheer cliff, and behind us is the puddle of mud we crawled out of, small and distant now, but still visible, I think we can still keep going, but it probably wont be very easy from this point on.",

It is a fairly primitive communication method, but sounds and images are pouring in now.\n\nInitial calculations seem to indicate these came from a region of space that we have yet to explore, and are about 188 billion cycles old. From all observations of the known universe that means this planet had intelligent life almost 20 billion cycles sooner than any previous estimate in the universe.\n\n**Year 17,345 (approximately 6,451 cycles) of Sentient Life:  Day 231\n\n197 Billion cycles since the creation of the universe.**\n\nInitial translations name this planet Terra or Earth. They seem to be a bi-pedal species that had developed some limited solar travel, and was on a small water dominant planet about 19,0000 cycles from their galactic core moving at the speed of light.\n\nCalculations have begun about using warp technology to investigate this planet. I am in contention to be a member of the science team.\n\n**Year 17,350 (approximately 6,452 cycles) of Sentient Life:  Day 11\n\n198 Billion cycles since the creation of the universe.**\n\nWe have made 16 jumps and are now approaching Earth.\n\nI was placed in charge of the science team, which means I'm 3rd in command of this mission over all. The diplomacy team of course is first, and Xiera is the lead of the defense force, making her second in charge.\n\nOur goal is to observe this planet and see if life is still abundant, as well as if the humans have left any data we can collect.\n\n**Year 17,353 (approximately 6,452 cycles) of Sentient Life:  Day 412\n\n198 Billion cycles since the creation of the universe.**\n\nThe black dwarf that was once their star helped us find their planet. Long since stripped of any life or atmosphere, the Earth remains. Initial scans of the planet's surface left no evidence of any structures. \n\nDeep core scans have revealed that some large storage was created and injected under the crust of the planet. After some drilling, we were able to access the datacore. We have no way of interfacing with it as their technology is so alien.\n\nAfter additional drilling it was possible to extract the entire unit.\n\nWe are now en route to home, and our top technologists are trying to bridge the gap between our tech and theirs.\n\nThis planet held life, and had a star that died out, blew up, and then fizzled away long before our planet even held the beginnings of life. We may never know their secrets, but we will continue to gather their signals, and hopefully learn lessons about the history of the universe.\n\nEdit: Fixed a word",

Everyone on the expedition knew that finding a civilization enduring for such a vast period of time was unthinkable. Then again we didn't know of any civilization that had existed so long ago so some slim impossible hope remained.  \n\nWas I imagining immense superstructures dotting the star system? Artificial wormholes and plasma fields lingering on from a civilization that had advanced in its age far beyond ours?\n\nWe found the system unassuming, cold and dark even by celestial standards. It is unlikely that anyone would notice much less visit the system, if they weren't tracking those signals back to a source. \n\nI fervently hope the datacore we recovered from deep under the planet's crust will show some tracks of this sentient life enduring at least for a time beyond this place. Perhaps I've personified the civilization too much, but I want to imagine its final end somewhere brightly shining in testament to them and not around a mere frozen ember of a star.  \n\nStanding here in the shadow of a world so ancient and so empty, I feel strangely grateful that their signals endured. Whatever their ultimate fate, their echoes endure unabated.\n\nCould our own civilization ask for more?",

            "comment": "Log 0378:\nDay 0985 of the Hend\u2019ari Expedition:\n\nIt has been sometimes since our last update to the Council, the QEC was damaged after a slight miscalculation of our ship\u2019s FTL vector.\n\nThankfully Chief Engineer Hans was able to repair the QEC with minimal expenditure, and has added some shielding in case similar incident, but none the less, seeing as it is my duty to double check ever calculation made by Chief Navigator Ellieen, I take full responsibility for the three weeks of silence and any panic this may have caused.\n\nTo quickly summarize the goings on of the last few weeks, all systems and supplies are within projected conditions  and there has yet to be any change as to the time of our return.\n\nAs too our finds we have found one more garden world perfectly suitable for colonization, two black holes within acceptable parameters for Event Horizon energy production,  three dozen gas giants rich in He3, as well as two hundred and five mineral rich planets.\n\nIndividual classing tables as well as coordinates also included of course.\n\nBut the most interesting finding is the detection of artificial radio waves arriving from the opposite direction of our space.\n\nIn preparation for the potential first contact, the black box is being kept up to date on a by the hour basis, the translation technology is undergoing checks for any glitches or disrepair and the diplomats on board are being on high alert at all times in case we encounter any other ships.\n\nDu bist ein Kind,\nCaptain Lukas.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nLog 0379:\nDay 0986 of the Hend\u2019ari Expedition:\n\nOur findings are... less optimistic than we had hoped.\n\nEighteen hours ago our engineers had pinpointed the exact system from which the signals originated, five hours ago we arrived within the system and a quick scan revealed nine garden worlds within the system, as well as three spaceport like structures clocking the entirety of the gas giants within the system.\n\nThat was not an error in the QEC that Chief Engineer Hans overlooked, all our telescopes, state of the art need I not remind you, found the nine planets a mix of green and purple urban, clearly showing colonization and habitation, as well as three much larger planets completely covered by a long sheet of purple metal buildings.\n\nOne could attribute the purple as a color preference of the species and considering the rarity of garden worlds, with the Nigel system, possessing the previous highest number of garden worlds found in a single system, sporting only three garden worlds, this is either a great anomaly or these people possess terraforming technology centuries ahead of the most recent developments at the Templin Institute.\n\nAnd seeing the flying cities encapsulating the gas giants, I would bet it be the latter of the possibilities.\n\nBut this is the unsettling part, even though we found tens of thousands of ships in the system, not a single one responded to our hails, even the planets and flying cities ignored our calls.\n\nWearily, I dispatched a shuttle of marines as well diplomats to the nearest planet and they found the streets completely empty, great plazas and labyrinths left abandoned,\n\nAnd while we might attribute this simply to a system hastily abandoned before the Star exploded, scans show the Star of the system still boasts millions of years within it\u2019s lifetime.\n\nAnd after a direct command by myself to ascend the tower which shadowed planet, they found only found a small symbol on the very top of the tower, easily identified by it\u2019s metallic color contrasting with the purple of the city.\n\nThe image of the symbol is attached to the log.\n\nAt that moment one of the marines tried to scratch the purple surface of the city, and bring back a sample, the scientists who examined it found long strings of DNA within the proteins that make it up.\n\nIt is their working theory that this is the blood of an advanced life form, and although gene mapping will take a while yet, almost all the scientist suspect they will find the Milch-34 strand, which as they explain it to me, is the strand found in species that boast sapience. \n\nWe will continue landings on the garden worlds and giants, and await the gene mapping, the Blackbox is now being updated by the minute and I have dedicated much crew effort into insuring the warp device within activates.\n\nI would also advice some military preparation be taken.\n\nIch seid die Kinder,\nCaptain Lukas.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nLog 383:\n\nDay 996:\n\nYou will notice this report will not contain much in the way of formaility or proper etiquette and I must apologize.\n\nAs I have said in my last report, we have continued to go deeper into this systems, everyday our engineers are more amazed by the technology and circuitry they find and the entire crew shudders as we bypass dozens of blood soaked perfectly terraformed planets, flying cities and massive spaceports.\n\nAs usual we attempt hailing in every system, but two minutes ago, something unusual happened.\n\nOne of the ships responded.\n\nAnd though translation software has yet to decipher the message, I can only fear what it might hold.\n\nOur navigators detect a ship they claim to be fifty million kilometers long heading towards us, they detect it is made of organic rather than synthetic material, and it will arrive in a few minutes.\n\nI truly hope this is not my final log, but if it is, tell my daughter, no matter how cold and distant I was and no matter how much she might hate me, I always loved you and have been proudest father in world.\n\nLukas\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nOkay... so the idea initially was to just have abandoned human systems numbering in the thousands cause they ascended somewhere or died out, then I couldn\u2019t think of an ending, so it was humans who went extinct because of some threat, but I felt that was against the premise of the prompt so it became humans ascended into god like things that drive species extinct and paint their planets with blood?\n\nI feel like it could have been better, but the Duolingo bird is getting pissy with me and I\u2019m getting tired so that was all I came up with.\n\nAlso, I feel like it would be better if i added another log to give them some reason to be afraid of the organic monstrosity at the end, but; hey. \n\nFirst drafts will suck anyway, so I\u2019m just rolling with it. \n\nEdit, rereading the prompt, I feel like I might have stepped out of the premise, and logs from the archeology team sent into abandoned human systems might have been better but, this took me like an hour so good enough?\n\nEdit2, okay, I thought this might get buried, but at least like 12 people have read it, so for any future readers, the thing I like about this style of stories, ie prompts is it gets a lot of stories out fast so critiscm can be heard and stuff can actually improve, and the writer can\u2019t take anything personally cause they invested so little time into it.\n\nSoooo anyone else, what\u2019s the biggest narrative or writing failing in this?",

A war in which there would be no victory. Against a foe that sought to tear the galaxy asunder and could not be defeated. Themselves.\n\nI shuddered at the thought.\n\nThis world, unlike the tens of thousands like it, was the Homeworld of the species that my people had looked up to for so very long. They still existed in some way. Their descendants scattered across much of the galaxy still mourned the loss of their ancestral home. Earth.\n\nEveryone in the galaxy knew of them, and by as many names as there were stars. The Guardians, the Old Ones, the Ancients, the Hominids. Their true name was long gone and forgotten. Abandoned in their haste to distance themselves from what they once were, even as they embraced their heritage as the true inheritors of the galaxy. For what claim could be made by others against the Descendents of those who lived, conquered and ruled so many aeons before our most distant ancestors had even climbed from the primordial soup?\n\nOf course they were challenged, time and time again. But even fractured into a thousand Star Nations they were indomitable. Undeafetable.\n\nThis expedition was only even possible with assistance from them, as any attempt to \"defile\" their ancestral home was met with a fury the likes of which had ripped apart the galaxy the last time it had been unleashed in the single-minded goal of defending that which they could never regain. And punishing those who dared to trespass where even they hesitated to go.\n\nAnd now that I can see the planet, I think I understand why.\n\nThis is a grave. A grave for the billions reduced to ash in a civil war, and the remains forced to flee aboard primitive starships. For this happened not at their height, but long before the creation of even the fist node of the translight network. \n\nAnd as I look out the window, I can see green forests, blue oceans, land teeming with life. And yet, there is Something there. Something missing, like a small, clean hole in a masterful painting. An inky void that, while noticed, can scarcely even be described.\n\nThis was a dead world because even overgrown with new life, you could hear the echoes of what once was. Sprawling cities of glass and metal reaching towards the sky, roads and rails connecting disparate groups across thousands of miles. The scars, not of war but of civilization itself were what haunted this place.\n\nI looked around the bridge, and I think the others saw it too.",

Am I reading this right?\u201d Korjal said with prudent curiosity. \u201cMy readout is telling me SL-2 is emitting weird elevated amounts of radio waves.\u201d Somaat got up from his station and meandered to her side. \u201cProbably, or maybe the calibration\u2019s off. Where is it again?\u201d Somaat grumbled. \u201cSL-2 is in the Orion Arm.\u201d\n\n \u201cAre the arrays in sync?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you looking with correct optics?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSensors?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm...\u201d Somaat growled. \u201cNo worries, we\u2019ll get a diagnostics team to look at the software. But in the meantime, I suggest *you* notify the Congress on your findings.\u201d Korjal flinched in her seat, \u201cSir? Is that wise? We don\u2019t know if-\u201d \u201cIf it is, you may have found *the* first civilization. If not, it was a fluke with the equipment, nothing more. Either way, we will have our answer tomorrow.\u201d\n\n**10 Days since Discovering Life in the SL-2 System**\n\n*After Korjal\u2019s findings were presented to the Stellatic Congress, a task force was quickly established and mobilized to reach the SL-2 system, and if it\u2019s inhabitants still extant, to perform First Contact on behalf of the Living Worlds Confederacy. Being the entirety of the Cofederacy resides in the Scutum-Crux, and again assuming SL-2 harbors life still, SL-2 would remain largely autonomous until Portal Apparatuses can be emplaced. Being the two who first observed SL-2 readings, colloquially known as the \u201cOld Ones,\u201d they were given special permission to be on the task force.*\n\nKorjal stood by Somaat\u2019s side. \u201cAnd how long did you say the voyage will take, Sir?\u201d Somaat inquired the Commander. \u201cIf we leave on schedule, and there are no major inconviences, we should reach the system within 20 days.\u201d Korjal was no warfighter, she was an astronomer. \u201cPlease, Commander, this is a scientific mission. Why are we embarking on a navy cruiser?\u201d The Commander smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent point Korjalmis. We are simply acting as a security force. In fact, we have stripped most of our munitions and arms to make room for the equipment and any artifacts you may find!\u201d Korjal smiled, and the three went on their way. In three days time, they would embark on a journey that would challenge everything they knew.\n\n\n**25 Days since Discovering Life in the SL-2 System**\n\n*The expidition went off without a hitch. All personnel accounted, and all equipment in inventory. Over the 20 day voyage the instruments were flooded with new signals and data was ever increasing. What no one expected however, was how quickly the signals changed. It was as if whatever species lived at SL-2 was extremely adept at honing and perfecting the technology they had, and inventing new tech. The scientists and researchers on board were so overwealmed, the Commander altered course to a nearby star system approx. 1.5 parsec from SL-2. The Commander, with imput from the the research team, held steady for an additional 2 days while the data was being analyzed.**\n\nSomaat buzzed Korjal\u2019s bunk door, there was an urgency to his ringing. \u201cHey, Korjal, open up! Today\u2019s the day!\u201d He called in his gruff rumple of a voice. \u201cWe\u2019re finally going to see SL-2! With our own eyes!\u201d The bunk door slid open, and a groggy, yet exited, Korjal slunk out, \u201cAwesome! What has the data collected show?\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know! It\u2019s nothing like what we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Korjal perked up, \u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d Somaat sighed, \u201cThere was definitely a civilization here at one point, but looking through radar and telescope, we can\u2019t see anything- nothing. And yet the signals are strongest and most advanced they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d Just then the intercoms blunted to life. \u201cAll non essential naval crew and research personnel are now permitted to make way to the observation decks Also and Calso. Special clearance for Somaatsos and Korjalmis to board the bridge.\u201d\n\n*As the two made there way to the bridge, the crew was emanating excitement. It was one thing if an intelligent race rose from the soil or sea in the Scrutum-Crux, the world\u2019s were close, and most rose around the same time. But SL-2... this was different. All data shows the species here life millions- if not billions- of years. These were the first. Who knows if there\u2019s anything left, or if there are just mighty ruins of the mighty race that erected them.*\n\n\u201cWelcome to the bridge.\u201d The Commander beamed. \u201cThank you for inviting us, Sir,\u201d Korjal spoke, trying to curb her excitement. \u201cThis is it, the moment of truth. It\u2019s been a pleasure and honor for myself and my crew to be chose for this momentous occasion,\u201d the Commander continued. They will speak of us, especially if you, until the end of time!\u201d Somaat turned to his partner, \u201cSo, what will you call them?\u201d She looked at him with confusion. \u201cYou were the one to find the signal, and to present the idea to Congress. You should name them. Personally I would call them the Precursors.\u201d She smiled, \u201cYes, I like Precursors.\u201d Just then an alarm went off. \u201cSir, sensors are showing multiple objects closing in on our coordinates,\u201d the Bosun snipped. \u201cSir, we have an incoming transmission from an unknown source.\u201d Another officer added. \n\n\u201cGo to Yellow Alert.\u201d \n\nJust then, 10 ships of unknown origin decloaked. \u201c&gt;!This is the ENS *Serenity*. Unknown Vessel, you are entering Earthen Space. Halt course or you will be destroyed.!&lt;\u201d \u201cTechnitian, what are they saying?\u201d The Commander barked. \u201cUnknown Sir! We are cross referencing the reansmission to the datalogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommander, could these be the Precursors?\u201d Korjal inquired, unsure of what she was expecting the answer to be. A massive ship, even beyond the size of the largest Conferacy ship dropped out of subspace. \u201c&gt;!This is the ENS *Serenity*.  Unknown Vessel, this is your final warning. Do not enter the Oort Cloud, or you will be eliminated.!&lt;\u201d\n\n\u201cLieutenant, open up a hailing frequency and order all engines to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cAffirmative, Commander.\u201d\n\nSomaat and Korjal were both amazed, and frightened. When they studied astronomy, this was not what they signed up for.",

They sent probes and people, signals and dreams, but they found nothing- all attempts fruitless. But failure does not define them. Soon they seeded the worlds around Earth: great forests on Luna, seas on Mars, and buoyant cities floating above the Jovian bodies. As the millennia pushed on, the Sun soon began to expand, consuming the terrestrial planets, including Earth. In dire need of a new home, humanity developed their own form of subspace travel to reach the stars beyond their dying home. But once the door is open, it can be entered from both ways...*\n\nTitan sat in the void of space, Saturn below contrasting beautifully against the hazy blue atmos\n\n\u201cSir, AICOPS is reporting unusual XRay bursts coming from the Scutum-Crux, and they are progressively moving in our direction,\u201d Lt. Dufrene said, \u201cand they request that all available ships move towards the Alpha Centauri system. What is our response?\u201d Captain Greene scoffed, \u201cThey have no authority over us! Do they not get they are just some eggheads who look at some pretty light in the sky?\u201d The Captain\u2019s voice turned into a roar, \u201cWe are trying to stop a civil war here, damnit! Saturn is Earth\u2019s last hope! And we are spread thinner than onionskin!\u201d Greene threw his coffe against the wall, \u201cAnd we can\u2019t do anything about it! *Damnit!*\u201d The bridge fell silent, save for the alert tones and computers. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my quarters. Only disturb me if the ship is under siege.\u201d \n\nGreene slumped into his chair. The only thing he loved more than Earth was his family, who called Earth home. He would do anything to protect their- and by extension her- future, even if it it meant risking himself, his crew, and his ship. Just as he was dozing to sleep, he was starteled by his holocast. \u201cSIVAIS, accept transmission.\u201d \u201cYes, Captain. Transmission from COSNAVCOM. From Admiral Mahcor.\u201d Greene stood up from the chair and ran his hands Ne\u00f3n his uniform. The wall sputtered into a video feed. The Admiral had on a generic stoic commanding face, but his eyes showed tangible concern. \u201cGood Afternoon Captain.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know we are all in a tough spot right now, and Lord knows we can\u2019t handle anymore, but we have some troubling information.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what would that be, Admiral?\u201d\n\nThe Admiral sighed, \u201cWe... We believe we are not alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d Green said, clearly ignorant to what the admiral was trying to communicate.\n\n\u201cWe- we believe we aren\u2019t alone.\u201d The Admiral hushed his voice, \u201cWe believe there is other life- alien life. And they found us first.\u201d\n\nAll Greene could mutter was a faint \u201c*holy shit.*\u201d Not only was humanity on the brink of war and extinction, now they had to worry about an entirely new threat. \u201cAICOPS sent you new directives, and I personally apologize for not informing you sooner, but they are now directly working under COSNAVCOM.\u201d The Admiral continued, \u201cThe *Serenity* is to rendevous with a task force of cloak enhanced frigates, I\u2019ll let you coordinate with their captains. Godspeed, Out\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you Sir, Out.\u201d\n\n**10 Hours before First Contact**\n\n*The crew was on edge, and rightfully so. Their world was falling apart- Earth felt moments away from total collapse, Saturn was on the brink of secession, and now an unknown, truely alien threat has made itself known- but to what extent remained out of reach. Were they coming for war? Peace? Were they just travelers? Was it even aliens at all? Captain Greene notified his crew on the new directives, and to expect the worst. Even at max subjumping, the trek to Alpha Centauri would take two days time, and if the eggheads were right, the unknown XRay bursts were traveling magnitudes faster. Wild speculation and whispered gossip flooded mess halls, bunk rooms, flight decks and even the bridge. Strategies and wargames were underway- not that there was time to come up with redundancies. Recent scans of the anomaly shows that it is altering course to the Alpha Centauri system. Captain Piluda, of the lead frigate* Humboldt Rhys, *would take command of operations. The 10 frigates would remain cloaked 1 lightyear Out from the trinary star system, and wait for the entity to drop out of subspace.* \n\nCaptain Piluda stood at the helm. Whatever was coming, they were coming here first. She glanced around the bridge. Her crew was busy coordinating logistics- where will this ship be located, what is the role of this ship, and such. \u201cEnsign, hail the *Serenity*,\u201d she ordered, \u201cI will correspond in my quarters.\u201d \u201cAye Captain.\u201d The Ensign snapped dutifully. \u201cAh, good morning Captain Piluda,\u201d Greene bubbled, \u201cHow are your crew holding up?\u201d \u201cThey are on edge, as anticipated, but spirits are holding.\u201d Piluda said pleasantly, \u201cBut enough pleasantries. My logistics team is informing me that the best course of action is for you to wait in subspace.\u201d Greene paused a moment, \u201cAs a last line of defense?\u201d \u201cThat is correct, Captain. Be ready to scramble the fighters.\u201d \n\n**0 Hours before First Contact**\n\n*Radar and subspace sensors showed that the source of the XRay bursts is in fact a vessel of unknown origins, approximately a kilometer in length, powered by fusion-fission cycle. How it even works is entirely unknown. Captain Piluda ordered the* Serenity *to be the \u201cvoice\u201d of humanity, while the regular communications occur on subspace channels.*\n\nOne could almost hear the thump from the alien ship dropping out of subspace. To the average eye, and to any human eye for that matter, it looked like a warship. But parts didn\u2019t go where they should. The engines were in front, what appeared to be the bridge was on the keel, and what appeared to be guns were on horizontal masts perpendicular to the ship. Piluda made sure all her ships maintained true space radio silence, the last thing she needed was for the trap to be missprung. The alien vessel idled its way forward, unaware of the fleet. Wait... *wait...*\n\n\u201cGo.\u201d\n\nThe frigates disengaged their cloaking. \u201cAll hands battlestations. Prepare for engagement.\u201d An officer belted over the intercoms. Piluda looked at the Ouija Board, tracking each motion of the unknown vessel in relation to hers. Greene looked out into the void, at the warships ready to kill. \u201cIt\u2019s time, Mr. Dufresne. Let them know we are here.\u201d Lt. Dufresne snapped into action, \u201cAy Captain.\u201d Dufresne opened hailing frequencies on all channels. \u201cThis is the ENS *Serenity*. Unknown Vessel, you are entering Earthen Space. Halt course or you will be destroyed.\u201d  The unknown vessel maintained its course. \u201cCaptain?\u201d Dufresne asked with little clue as what to expect. \u201cEnsign, hail *Humboldt Rhys*\u201d Greene ordered. \u201cI want to know what\u2019s going on. Technician, drop us out of sub space. Lieutenant, hail the, again.\u201d\n\nThe *Serenity* dropped out of subspace with a flash of light. Her massive hull dwarfed small cities. \u201cThis is the ENS Serenity.  Unknown Vessel, this is your final warning. Do not enter the Oort Cloud, or you will be eliminated.\u201d\n\nAll eyes watched, quite frankly with fear and dread, as the alien vessel slowly came to a halt. \u201cSir,\u201d The Ensign quivered, \u201c*We* are being hailed.\u201d",

            "comment": "\"Mannaseraie... Mannaseraie..., MANNASERAIE!\"\n\nThe words jolt me from my third-state reverie and I am shamed. To delve so deeply into a memory is a failure of one kind, but this! This cannot stand! How can I hope to return to first-state lucidity and my work if my mind traps me within waking dreams?\n\nThe quisitor is attractive, with a velvet thorax that gleams scarlet under the fluorescent lights, just like that of my mate, Xerian. But no... I cannot have that thought. Xerian is gone, and so are Havlor and Parssasian, and that is a third-state reverie I cannot bear. I will not lose whatever dignity I have left to me in this room. \n\n\"Mannaseraie Belshia,\" the quisitor says to me, and I lift my mottle to stop its speech. \n\n\"As it pleases me, I am not a Mannaseraie in this room,\" I say. \"You will call me Belshia.\" \n\nThe quisitor acquiesces. This is the only time I have claimed my rank with it; I am content to let it drive the remainder of our time together. \"Belshia, my query is this--when you found the probe of the First Ones, and it led you to their home planet, what did you see there that unsettled you? What did you see that has caused you to have problems with maintaining first-state lucidity?\" \n\nI pause to answer, and this time the quisitor lifts its mottle to interrupt me. Within, I am happy for this, for I am able to quell another surge from within. The grief, the sorrow, the wisdom... the resonance. \"Belshia--I know about the loss of Xerian and your progeny. It is clear that loss is integrated with what you found on,\" and here it pauses to check its screen, \"Earth? Such a weird name--do you agree? You would think there would be thousands of different names for their home world based on all the cultures we know about, but it's always 'Earth', or 'Terra'.\" The quisitor runs its mottle down its thorax as an indication of second-state abstract thinking, and I hope it doesn't notice my spirules expand just a little. It has been a long time since I have last known intimacy. \n\n\"But I digress--it is clear that the loss is integrated from an incident in your expedition team,\" the quisitor continues, \"when you went to the smallest continent. Can you please explain it to me? It is my hope that we can apply second-state logic to begin identifying the triggers that slip you into third-state.\" \n\nI feel the reverie begin to swell, my mind slipping at its edges into the immediacy of the hallucination. So I begin talking, because that will forestall my eventual loss of lucidity. \n\n\"We were navigating a series of ravines around one of the few intact bunkers on the smallest continent,\" I said. \"The solar radiation and engulfment by Earth's star in its red giant phase burned away everything else. But somehow that bunker was still there. Billions of cycles old--I have no explanation for why it still existed, but that doesn't matter. It was the greatest historical find in all our history--in all that is perhaps of the universal continuum.\" I swallow, air pushing down my spiculae and removing the globs of spittle that surge up when I'm stressed. \n\n\"I had put the loss of my family away into second-state reverie because there was nothing I could do. What can you do when there is a dimensional discontinuity that obliterates the ship your mate and spawn are traveling in, to come to you? When you are thousands of light years away? I thought I was keeping myself in prime working form, until I saw the child.\"\n\n\"It was a... the term is 'human', child, in a spacesuit outside the bunker. Billions of years old, yet the suit was intact thanks to the vacuum. The ridge that housed the bunker managed to protect the suit from severe radiation. I came round a large boulder and saw it, sitting there, its helmet staring out at the stars.\" \n\nThe memories come, and through sheer will I hold them back, describing them while refusing to let them carry me away into a deep dream. I will keep my dignity, by all that I have left and by the memory of my family! \"I could not see within the glass, and perhaps I did not need to. But in that moment I knew that this human child had died while looking at the stars. That its atmosphere was gone and there was no hope left within its species. But it went outside into the void to stare up at us, hoping we would come save it.\" \n\nI cough up the spittle now, freely, and the quisitor pretends that I am still in control of my presence. I haven't coughed this hard since the Forever Rite for Xerian and my spawn. \"The thing is, quisitor, we did. I did. I have my memory of it. We recorded it. We saved the data and the information in that bunker, we found the other bunkers. We know now what the humans did, what their wars and their hopes and dreams were. But we were billions of cycles too late. Just like I was too late.\"\n\n\"All I can do is move forward, quisitor.\" I say. \"Because to do anything else means that the child died for nothing. That my mate and my spawn died for nothing. I am doing the best I can.\"\n\nThe quisitor flushes, and it is the deepest blue of empathy I have ever seen. \"I understand, Belshia. Thank you for telling me. This, is where we can begin.\"",

            "comment": "What the scans showed was impossible. Unheard of. Three potentially habitable planets in orbit around a single star. All within the acceptable temperature range, all with an oxygen-rich atmosphere. Granted, the readings from the second planet had some anomalies we couldn't explain, but it was hard enough finding a single habitable planet to colonize, especially when so many already contained intelligent life of their own. Finding three potential options at once was a miracle. The scouting mission was put together faster than I'd ever seen, and every single person in the program wanted to be on it. I was one of the lucky ones.\n\nOur goal was to blaze a trail for the largest colonization effort in history. Unfortunately, the universe had other ideas. What we hoped for was paradise. What we found was tragedy. Our estimates of the star's lifespan were off by a few million years. It was well on its way toward becoming a red giant, and the innermost of the three garden worlds had already been scoured clean. The other two were intact, but well out of the habitable range. But as surprised as we were to find this beautiful yellow star already dying, nothing could have compared to what we found next.\n\nThe second of the three planets was surrounded by a massive amount of orbital debris, clearly artificial in nature. A perfect explanation for the anomalies in our readings, but one that would have been unthinkable to consider. Given the time it took for the light from this star to reach our research station, we were looking at the system as it was billions of years ago, long before intelligent life evolved in the galaxy. And yet, somehow, it was true. Somehow, intelligent life evolved on this planet faster than was ever thought possible. And just a few million years before our arrival, that life was wiped out.\n\nLater expeditions found that towering buildings had once covered nearly the entire surface of the second planet, and much of the other two. Estimates of the number of inhabitants were staggering. Far greater than we thought could possibly be supported by three small worlds. We were desperate for evidence of the technology that had allowed them to support such a densely packed civilization, but found nothing. Whatever devices held their secrets weren't built to last.\n\nEventually, however, we discovered something different. A vault, built deep into the side of a mountain, containing vast stores of information that had survived the countless millennia unscathed. Here was where they had undoubtedly stored their most precious information. Scientists all over the galaxy were buzzing with excitement, wondering what new technology we might discover. Anthropologists begged to be allowed to examine the records to see what they could uncover about this ancient civilization. The government decided to share the information freely, and linguistic experts from countless species joined the effort to translate the language. Eventually, they succeeded, and the citizens on every world held their breath as they revealed what precious knowledge these ancient people had so carefully preserved.\n\nThey were names. Families. Sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, uncles and aunts, ancestors going back countless generations. Trillions of souls, preserved in memory by their connections to one another. A passionate plea from a long-dead people, saying \"We remembered them. Please, remember us.\" And we did. To this day, many parents choose a name for their child by combing through the endless list we recovered. Julia Wagner. DeSean Williams. Li Wei Chen. Imani Abara. We don't know who they were, or how they felt being alone in the universe, but we remember them.\n\n^(The inspiration for this story was the Granite Mountain Records Vault)",

            "comment": "\"Sir, we can confirm what the Blorgian scanners have already shown us.  There are ruins down there.  Big ones,\" exclaimed Under Commander Artexi, waving a tentacle frantically.\n\n\"Let the drop team know we will be releasing the Under Carriage for insertion then.  And for Glarph's sake stop waving that tentacle.  Shipwoman Ipoctao already thinks you want to mate with her, and if you keep that up she will spear you with her beak in the next few fragomores,\" the Captain said.  It wasn't joking.  An old Squid had the advantage of being sexless, but Ipoctao was desperate to procreate at only fifty-four, and Artexi was young enough to attract any mating age Gloperine female.\n\nSince the SkyGazer Clan had determined that the Ancient of Ancients, the oldest known race in the universe had originated from this rather indistinct little yellow star system, the Great Council had ordered an Exploration.  Captain Hgorla was pleased to have the lead ship, and as such, none of the other Partex (a group of five hundred Gloperine Water Ships) ships could send out their Under Carriages filled with anxious Science Squids until his had touched down and made an initial report.\n\n\"Under Carriage away. Drop in progress.  Atmosphere is as thin as predicted, Captain but the heat shield is nominal.,\" reported Artexi.\n\nThe Under Carriage made its drop pretty much on the attack vector Hgorla had approved.  It was pleased.  The specific ruin was mostly buried under the strange vegetation of this world.  It was odd looking at a world of sentient beings that wasn't covered in water.  They had oceans, yes, but almost a third of the visible mass was above the level of the seas.  The Blorgian scanners had confirmed that there were no ruins fully immersed, no evidence these Ancients had ever lived solely under the water.  It was unnatural, thought Hgorla, but it's people had met other races who lived this way.  Ah well, it's immediate work was done, time for a nice massage.  \n\n\"You have the command, Artexi,\" said the Captain as it thrust itself through the water towards his Ship Cave.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nThe decision made, the Under Carriage landed on the edge of the water near one of the great ruin's tallest towers.  Of course, it was mostly fallen and covered in vegetation, but the Blorgian readouts were clear.  Under that mess of surface plants were the remains of a once great civilization. \n\n\"Now, make sure your suits are properly sealed.  We don't want to lose water while we do our immediate survey,\" whistled out Thinker Blaicjni.  Having been chosen to be the lead Fact Finder, it would not allow anything as clumsy as a death from suffocation to mar his efforts.  \"Everyone set?\"\n\n\"Confirmed, all set,\" whistled back Under Thinker Hrongat.  She checked the straps on each one of the four Thinkers that was assigned with her. Blaicjni was a droll old squid but it was brilliant too.  If it hadn't already gone into the neutral age of their species, she might have been tempted to pierce him once or twice.  \n\nThe outer doors opened and the dry heat and light atmosphere of the planet filled the cargo area.  Hrongat saw one of the younger Thinkers shudder and remembered her first time stepping onto a world above water.  Sympathetically she inched out a tentacle and tapped him gently.  \n\"Let's go, Loperi, we haven't got all Morgath,\" she encouraged.\n\nThe party walked carefully down the ramp and waded towards the target building.  She could see on the portable Blorgian she carried that their entry point was about two thirds up the total height of the remains.  If Glarph was playing the bones today, the rest of the building below their entrance would be submerged.  Walking on dry was acceptable, but she always relaxed a little when they were safely under.\n\nSure enough, a little work with their high pressure water tools cleared the vegetation and opened the building up.  It was dark inside, but they had brought plenty of light.  Blaicjni went first, as was his right, then she followed and the rest of the Thinkers jostled for position behind her.  \n\nThe inside of the building was dry.  Hrongat saw Blaicjni hesitate, then with a firmness she didn't share, he set out towards the center of the building.\n\n\"How is this possible?\" asked Loperi. \"This building is beyond ancient. Beyond anything we know.  Surely the sea, the pressure, the vegetation, something would have breached it before us?\"\n\nHrongat was about to answer when Thinker Blaicjni stopped her with a single whistle.  \"No. Do not speculate.  Let us move in, and down and see if we can find a rational explanation for what now appears unreasonable,\" it demanded.\n\nThey continued to the center where they found a great staircase.  It was clearly designed for a method of propulsion different than that used by even land based Gloperines, were there such a thing.  The descent was wide, but with short drops of less than half a tentacle's length.  It was awkward following it down, an awkwardness that increased with each level of descent.\n\nBlaicjni called for more light, so everyone turned on their suit lights.  Gloperines evolved in shallow waters, and their cities were built on mountains in their oceans.  As their first explorations were to the depths of their own seas, bright light was something they did very, very well.\n\nThe central staircase lit up below them.  At the bottom was a large globe, held up by ancient figures.  Hrongat trembled in excitement. \n\"Thinker,\" she said, \"are those actual representations of the biological race who lived here? Are we seeing the form of the Ancients?\"\n\"Don't assume,\" Thinker Blaicjni rebuked her. \"They could be pets, or fantastical beings as art, for all we know.\"\nHrongat wasn't so sure.  The bipedal beings that stretched their arms up to hold the Great Globe seemed too representative to be anything but the builders themselves.  She walked over to one and, without thinking of anything but how beautiful it was, gently touched it.\n\nA blast of pressure knocked her across the room.  She could see Blaicjni and the rest of the team had been pushed back as well.  Suddenly, the Great Globe began to move, and filled with light.\n\nTerrified, she did what any sensible Squid would do.  She released a blast of black ink.  In spite of her training, her education, instinct formed over a millions of years of evolution took over and a primal part of her reacted instantly.  Fortunately, the suits were designed with that contingency in mind and her response was gently contained in the lower suit, without anyone else being the wiser.\n\nThe light increased in volume then to her astonishment, a beam shot out from the globe and encompassed everyone in the room.  She felt as if her insides were being gently tickled, then as swiftly as it started, it stopped. \n\nWater began rushing in from all sides.  Not enough to hurt anyone, but she could see that the building was filling, as if accommodating the nature of those who now stood there.  Within seconds, the room was full, a natural light played across the globes and settled.\n\n\"What in Glarph's seven hells did you do, you moron?\" demanded Thinker Blaicjni.\n\n\"Nothing. Well, not nothing. I just touched it for a second,\" she stammered out.\nAs Blaicjni was about to lay into her the Blorgina on her tentacle sent out an alert.  It was quickly followed by alerts from the Blorginas on everyone's else's suits as well.  \n\n\"Thinker, fast movers. Dozens. Maybe hundreds?\" she hesitated.\n\"Where?\" it demanded.\n\"Everywhere,\" she cried.\n\nThe room was suddenly full of some kind of strange fish.  It was long, and slim, bigger than a Gloperine adult in the prime years, but not quite as big as Thinker Blaicjni.  They were emitting strange sounds, so on a hunch, Hrongat turned on her translation port.\n\n\"Welcome, welcome, welcome.  Hello!  Hello! No fear. Peace. And welcome,\" they shouted as they danced around her and the team.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\n\"Captain, please return to the bridge,\" whistled Artexi through the intership communicator.\n\nWithin the space of a few fragos the bulky Captain squeezed into the bridge.  \"Report,\" it demanded.\n\n\"Captain, please, this is Under Thinker Hrongat,\" the communicator whistled out.\n\n\"What?  Where is Thinker Blaicjni?  What in Glarph's name are you doing reporting?\" The Captain was more confused than angry.\n\n\"Um, Thinker Blaicjni is huddled into himself,\" Hrongat began.  The Captain and the bridge crew were shocked.  Only the most terrifying, life threatening event could cause that reaction.\n\nAs calmly as it could, the Captain whistled, \"Continue your report.\"\n\nHrongat described the descent, the machine they had found and then the resulting appearance of the fast movers.  Speaking slowly, as she suspected every ship in the Partex and perhaps even the Great Council would soon hear her report, she continued.\n\n\"They call themselves Dolphini, Captain. The Ancients set them a task. 'Watch and wait' they were commanded, 'until the globe calls you.'   They said they have been waiting billions of Fragmites and  are nearly unable to contain their joy that the Globe has come alive.  Their words, Captain,\" she said.\n\n\"So?  What does that mean to us?  Why is Thinker Blaicjni so...well, why?\" The Captain was afraid it knew.\n\n\"They said,\" Under Thinker Hrongat said carefully, \"That the Globe didn't just wake up to recognize a sentient species.  It also woke up the billions upon billions of Ancients who have been suspended in something they call \"black holes\" waiting to come out.  They said the Ancients were lonely. So they prepared their machines and hid. And waited. Until now.\"\n\nIn the center of the galaxy, held by forces impossible for the Gloperine science to even imagine, great powers began to shift, as the alarm clocks of fifty billion human beings woke them from their long nap.",

            "comment": "   The child stared up at the museum display in wonder, her 'ice cream' dripping onto the floor beside her. The nice lady at the shop had told Bo'tang that 'ice cream' was a treat humans used to eat during the Festival of Boga. The humans called the festival 'summer' in the English language and 'verano' in Spanish. Anyway, apparently this 'ice cream' was something humans would eat to stay cool when it got too hot. This type of ice cream was called 'chocolate'. \n\n   As Bo'tang lingered by the main display in the 'First Explorers' section of the Intergalactic History Museum, she looked at the area called 'Your Age in Human Years'. According to the display, if she were living on earth, she would be twelve years old. Bo'tang thought, 'You know you were an important species when an entire section of a museum is dedicated towards you.' She skipped over the parts she already knew about the so-called 'Cold War' and the Space Race. Why it was called the Cold War when lots of it took place over the summer, she didn't know. What she did know was that two amazing countries called 'the USA' and 'Russia' were so keen to expand their horizons beyond their planet that they went from no space travel at all to launching a satellite into orbit and landing on the Earth's only moon in less than one hundred years. \n\n   Bo'tang's mother called for her in the distance, but Bo'tang didn't want to go get lunch yet, she wanted to learn more about the humans. As she dilly-dallied, she noticed a grand display case in the center of a room off to the side, which held many artefacts recovered from the planet Earth. The first one was called the 'Tara Brooch', and it was apparently from a country called Ireland. Bo'tang eagerly read the description of the history of the item and  gasped internally when she learned that this beautiful piece of art had been created more than two thousand years before humans went into space, before humans even had electricity. It was such a gorgeous piece that she had assumed it must have been made with some advanced piece of technology. She realized, with a pang in her heart, how extraordinary these humans must have been. They were entirely alone in the universe, yet they put their loneliness aside and found the passion and drive to create small, delicate pieces of beauty. It was tragic that the actions of an ignorant few led to the death of an entire species eons before the next species had even begun exploring their own world. \n\n   As Bo'tang stood looking in on the artifacts, another caught her attention. It was a small pyramid, a tiny replica of the immense monuments which humankind had built to house and honor the dead. Bo'tang thought it was wonderful that humans would literally spend years building these incredible structures for their dead, even though they would never be thanked for it. These monuments weren't just a place for the dead; Bo'tang imagined them as living creatures, reaching for the sky, stretching desperately to find any proof that they weren't the only ones out there.\n\n   Bo'tang's mother finally caught up to her. 'Come on, Bo'tang, let's go and try that 'fish and chips' dish your aunt told us about!' she said with a tired smile. Determined, Bo'tang managed to drag her over to the next artifact before they left: a tiny television with the words 'Apollo 11' written across the top. Her mother reluctantly pressed the 'play' button on the display case and a blurry video of a rocket soaring through the sky began to play, with a man in the background exclaiming, 'Liftoff! We have a liftoff!' as the lonely species began its solo journey across the stars.",

Even more strangely, *so* close to the estimated creation of the very Universe we inhabit, that we may have to reevaluate our previous, seemingly impeccable, calculations entirely.\n\nWe have been able to trace the message back to it's place of origin, which fortunately is located within the observable universe. Being the message that got to us first, it must have been *the first ever sent from this species*, however, hopefully and likely, not the last. It will take us a while to reach this planet or what remains of it, I can only hope I will be able to see it in my lifetime.A species so ancient may contain secrets we cannot even fathom, having been here before the universe became what we have come to know and, to a degree, understand. Along our path to find answers, the formation of our society, our values, our habits, we may have unknowingly followed in their footsteps. As such, what we find on this planet may give us information on more than just the nature of the universe, but also the nature of all the species that have inhabited it, do , and *will forever more*.\n\nThrough them, we may come to know more about ourselves, *learn* things we never even considered needed to be given any thought, *answer* questions we never even got the chance to ask...\n\nIt should be noted, that based on the origin of the message it is unlikely, *nay,* **Impossible**, for them to still exist, which should be for the best, as, if we are to believe what applies to our species applied to them as well, even the smallest bias would dilute the truth, or even misshape it entirely.\n\nSteady progress is being made in decrypting  the message. From what we can understand now, it is mostly comprised of units that can take two possible values, either positive or negative, yes or no, nothing or one thing, 0 or 1...\n\nThere is also a simplistic design of what we assume to be, based on recorded similarities to our ancestors, their shape.\n\nSomething akin to a double helix seems visible, which can be nothing but the structure of the nucleic acid that makes them up, a primitive version of our own quadruple helix structured nucleic acid.\n\nJust below are 9 structures seemingly floating around a larger structure, which , based on knowledge we have from the star systems we have observed, our own included, can be nothing but their own star system at the time of the conception of this message.\n\nAnd lastly, a depiction of the device which launched the message itself, as it is too similar to a tool our species used eons ago to produce similar signals.\n\nThe entire message, seems to be an introduction.\n\n*Something* that is so simplistic, yet manages to convey much more than it lets on. A person (representing, in a way, their entire species) which states their name ( represented by the depiction of the average human and their molecular structure which identifies them), their home (represented by their star system) , and the place whence the message is sent ( represented by the satellite dish).\n\n*Something* which would even seem counterintuitive. Sending a message that you *know* will receive no answer in your lifetime or even your planet's, yet only providing so little information, *as if trying to initiate a simple conversation with a possible friend*, as if trying to reach on to someone in an endearing, childlike manner.\n\n*Something* that I feel we can relate too. Both in it's seeming lack of logic or reason, and in it's endearing, almost desperate, benevolent and innocent nature.\n\n*Something* that makes me want to respond in kind, a response I am currently working on compiling.\n\nIn spite of the fact *you* will never reach it, in spite of the fact *I* will never get an answer back, it seems only fair to introduce myself too, it seems only fair... to accept your friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Captain of Olympia                               - 2/54/:128\n\n\\-----------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!The Arecibo message was a short radio message sent into space to celebrate the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico in 1974.It was aimed at the globular star cluster M13, about 25,000 light years from Earth.

Indistinguishable from billions of other planets in the Milky Way.\n\nThe first giveaway of something extraordinary was its radiation signature; way beyond the expected range for its class.\n\nCloser inspection revealed ancient structures. Another civilization that burned itself out. Still not that uncommon.\n\nBut once a probe was sent down to radiodate the structures, an existential panic rippled across the galaxy. The species on this planet had reached its peak billions of years before any previously known intelligent life forms had evolved.\n\nThe electronic devices of this civilization had long since decayed. However, above the floating wreckage of orbiting satellite fragments (and one Tesla) was the final testament to the human race. Shielded from radiation, preserved at near zero degrees Kelvin, its data structure was intact. The information was stored in a format to be read by any civilization.\n\n\u201cWe have failed.\n\n\u201cWe have failed our own interest, assuring our mutual destruction. We have failed an even greater calling. A calling to spread to the stars. To spread life and vibrance across the night sky.\n\n\u201cWe were reckless. In our race to the future, we derailed. Greed, envy, and above all, intolerance, were our undoing. We were not worthy of the stars.\n\n\u201cOur world lays smoldering. In our final gasp, we choose to breath life into the aether. We spread packets of single celled life to the most fertile planets. May this seed a life form better than ourselves. One worthy to inherit the stars...\u201d\n\nOne by one, each warring races across the galaxy made a pilgrimage to \u201cEarth\u201d. To the genesis of their race, of all races. A common ancestry bound these disparate races together. A common threat, met by their progenitor race, served as a warning to would be warmongers.\n\nA golden age of prosperity rises from the fertile ashes of the humans empire, may they rest in peace.",

            "comment": "The craft was discovered in the outer reaches of solar system. Satellites tracked the strange object as it entered the vicinity of the planet. \n\nIt was obviously constructed, not naturally formed. If the appearance of deliberate design wasn't enough of an indication, then the radio signals it kept sending out proved it so. It was the first indication of extraterrestrial life ever received, the clearest and most undeniable proof that they were not alone in the universe.\n\nAfter that was what could only be described as a frenzy. Scientists gathered together to study the strange technology, to unlock the secrets that it held. Governments fought over control of the craft. And the people went into hysterics. Centuries of culture, spirituality, belief, was put into question the moment it arrived. Religious leaders called it a sign from the gods. Artisans were inspired, imagining what these extraterrestrial beings looked like. It was a cultural upheaval unlike any other. \n\nBut with its existence came the questions. Where did it come from? Who built it? Why was it made? The greatest minds in the world came together to answer them. Through their combined efforts, they were able to piece together the inner workings of, what was discovered as, ancient and alien technology. It was through a strange yellow metallic disk that contained grooves and symbs on both sides. At first, it was believed to be nothing more than a vestigial mechanical piece. But they soon proved this wrong when the engineers finally understood their purpose. \n\nThe disk was a message of sorts. The local technology did not mesh well with the alien engineering, but they nonetheless sparsed its contents. Images of strange objects and symbols. Some were recognizable, like the picture of a star and it's orbiting planets. Others less so, like the group of symbols that were discovered to be a strange form of mathematics that resembled and differed from their own. Images of living creatures in unfamiliar terrains, some even hostile to the species. There were also sounds embedded in the metal. A strange composition of high and low frequency waves that were both above and below the hearing ranges of the species. It was there first image of the strange  and distant world called \"Earth\". The revelation of its knowledge is considered by many as the greatest discovery in history, seconded only by the discovery of extraterrestrial life itself. \n\nBut then, another discovery was made.  It was was, once again, a discovery that  forever changed the course of history. An image made of lines, once considered as the alien's form of art, was translated to be a rudimentary map to its origin. It was primitive, and used rapidly rotating neutron stars as points that would indicate it's location. The system was incredibly flawed. They had to figure out which of the many stars was used, if they still existed, and calculated when all these stars were pulsing their radiation in an area that created the same set of coordinates on the plate. After that, they had to calculate where the planet would be now, given the movement of the stars in the galaxy and in the universe. It was daunting, and they almost gave up. But they managed to pull through. \n\nNow, cycles after its discovery, they were finally headed to the origin. The project is singlehandedly the most expensive endeavour in their history, and could possibly be the most important. Probes were initially made and released to gather intelligence on the area, simultaneously tested for the capacity of using a space-time bridge as a form of travel. When they received confirmation that a planet of similar description filled with alien life was discovered, they fast tracked the creation of the most advance space ship ever built, large enough to hold a sizeable crew, a vessel capable of initiating a bridge in space-time for instant arrival. It would bring them to the planet in no time. \n\nSo, in an array of lights and collapsing physics, their ship jumped through the bridge, into a new world of possibility. Theories of what they would find were abound, the probe design to make rudimentary confirmations of the planet and it's contents. They know that it was mostly liquid on the surface. Its land masses were rife with strange vegetation and animal life, very different from their own. All over the planet, there were structures that did not appear natural. They could only be described as artificially created buildings. They viewed this as the proof that they had found the planet. They were positive that they would finally meet another form of intelligent life. \n\nBut as they reappeared within the area of the planet, the bridge collapsing behind them in a cascade of rainbows, they were shocked with what they discovered.\n\nInstead of a planet of blue and filled with intelligent life, all they found was darkness. No planet, no sun, not even the stars themselves were there. Sensors indicated the presence of absolutely nothing. It was almost like they stepped into a void. A section of the universe that was completely blank and empty. Not even background radiation. Only an endless void that filled them with dread. \n\nThey tried to investigate, sending out more probes and scanners in the area. They all came back negative. No forms of matter were detected for light years in the area. All the sensors told them that there was nothing there. All except one. \n\nA solitary probe returned with a message received  from an unidentifiable origin. They tried to locate the source, but it was futile. Wherever it came from, it was lost in the sea of void that surrounded them. They picked apart the signal received and translated it into their native tongue and hearing frequency.  The computers did their best to integrate as much of the original content as it could. They succeeded. \n\nWith trepidation, they listened to what it had to say. And immediately regretted it. \n\nIt was chorus of screams, of cries of pain and suffering unlike ever heard before. Agony rendered to sound. Pure pain and misery. Mixed within the wails was a message, repeated over and over to infinity. \n\n*We made a mistake.*\n\n *We failed.*\n\n*Do not come here.*\n\n*Help us.*",

Dvlup replied, \"but mostly we found them in big heaps next to former cities, in what we assume were nature preserves, since they were big open spaces without buildings. But we also found a few spheres on the moon of the human planet, next to one of their landing sites.\"\n\n\"So they must have been significant?\" Prlax inquired while reorganizing some files on his desk. \n\n\"They must have been! The spheres may be small, but they might contain tremendous amounts of data storage, we just haven't figured out how to access it.\" Dvlup excitedly proclaimed.\n\n\"Yesterday I had a cultural humanologist in my office, I assume you know Dr. Mwlur?\" Prlax said, knowing full well of the very public academic rivalry between the two scientists, but it was more fun this way.\n\n\"Mudflap Mwlur? I can guess what the hack was going on about. He's told you the spheres are objects of pure cultural significance, correct?\" Dvlup huffed while his face turned an angry aquamarine. \n\n\"You'd guess correctly doctor, and he's making a pretty good case, especially since the spheres don't serve a practical purpose and don't seem to have any interesting computational, mechanical or otherwise significant qualities. Aside from bouncing really well I mean.\" Before Dvlup could reply, governor Prlax quickly added: \"I'm going to take a guess as well, you're going to say that the humans technology was too advanced for us to comprehend, but that's a rather convenient excuse in my opinion. Excuse my ignorance on the matter, but iff there's no sign of the spheres being technological artifacts, why is it the prevalent opinion among humanologists?\"\n\nDvlup eagerly pounced on the question: \"Because why else would humans take them everywhere they went? And the way humans built the spheres is marvelous. Most of the human artifacts are lost to the ravages of time. Erosion sanded down their buildings, their cities and infrastructure are almost totally gone. And yet the spheres endured, mostly. They are made from several complex materials, arranged in concentric spheres, to maximize durability. And the dents on the outside, which we assume were for data connections, are perfectly arranged in a mathematical pattern.\"\n\n\"They also make the spheres go faster when you throw them, right?\" Prlax asked. He knew the thought of throwing around human spheres was going to send the doctors frills on edge. He didn't care anymore, the meeting had been going on for a while and Prlax was getting hungry. The doctor should know this, the governors feeding tentacles were itching but Dvlup seemed to be oblivious to social clues. Typical egghead. \n\n\"I don't see how that would be relevant to either the scientific consensus or Mwlurs fringe theories.\" the doctor said coldly through edged frills, \"and I'd rather not risk anyone throwing around precious human artifacts, so I wouldn't know about it.\"\n\nGovernor Prlax decided that the quickest way to a lunch break would be to get the doctor on a different track, or barring that, to just piss him off: \"C'mon doc, we have a lot of different types of spheres. And no one knows what they are really for, so they might not be precious at all. Heck, considering they bounce and fly well, maybe that's what they were made for. You know, simple entertainment. Or a sport of some sort.\"\n\n\"Governor, with all due respect, you're being ridiculous. Are you suggesting humans braved the void in their primitive spacecraft, landing on the moon to play sports? Governor, I fear I misplaced my hopes in your support.\" Dvlup replied angrily. \"I hoped you'd be open to funding serious scientific inquiries, instead you come up with the ridiculous notion that the first intelligent species threw around these masterfully crafted artifacts, for what? Fun? Don't be absurd!\" \n\nAfter Dr. Dr. Hum. Dvlup had angrily slammed the door closed on his way out of the office and left the governor to his well deserved flatwich, Prlax enjoyed his meal and idly opened the present the doctor had left behind. Inside the laboratory-grade transport case he found three of the artifacts, just as he had expected. They were all the same size and shape, round with a dimpled surface, about the size of a human eyeball, based on the few well-preserved skulls the archaeologists had found. The only difference between them were the markings on the white outside, although Prlax knew from Dr. Mwlar's lenghty presentation the day before that they'd found some in other colors as well, but more rarely. While he gobbled the last few crumbs of his flatwich down, the governer compared the markings on the spheres. Callaway, Titleist, Taylormade. Strange markings indeed.\n\n**This is my first time on r/writingprompts so please be gentle.**",

            "comment": "\"Von Neumann Probe\", that's what they called them. Fully automated spacecraft that replicated exponentially and reached into every nook and cranny of the galaxy. Speculation has it that uncountable numbers of them are even still on their way to bridge the gaps between galaxies at this very moment. The crazy part is that they don't even have FTL drives, so \"just\" spreading within the galaxy took them millions of years, maybe even billions. No, but that's not really the crazy part; the really crazy part is that they sent them before they even had a sliver of hope to send colonists after them. For every star system they reached, they not only increased their number, but also looked for planets that met certain criteria and once they found one, they would start building a colony. Living quarters, maintenance, research and administrative facilities, fabrication units, recreation areas, landing areas for spacecraft. Everything a new outpost of civilization would need for a fresh start on a new planet. All lying dormant for millions of years, waiting for people to use them and faithfully maintained by automated systems.\n\nThey were so hopeful, so eager to expand, to explore the universe, like we have done in our time. But they never got the chance.\n\nFollowing the trail of ageing, unused colonies, we managed to locate their point of origin. As far as we could tell after all this time, the third planet of the star system was hit by a gamma-ray burst from a black hole, only a few thousand light years away. There might have been a few survivors, but if there were, they were unable to save their failing eco systems and died with their planet. Without the support of their homeworld, the space stations throughout their star system and the colonly on a moon of one of their gas giants withered and died shortly after. The most tragic part of it all is that, according to our xeno-archeologists, they were mere years from finishing a working FTL drive.\n\nBut, in a way, their tragedy was our fortune. Their probes and the technology and knowledge they contained kickstarted many budding civilizations when they visited their planets. Some used it to destroy themselves, probably more than we will ever know. But to many other peoples of the \"Milky Way\", as they'd called our galaxy, it was proof that they're not alone. That there are people out there with the means to leave their worlds. That there's more to life than just \"us\". It showed some of us that there were greater things to strive towards, that inspired them to leave behind the petty squabbles that seemed to dictate the flow of history for so long.\n\nAll we wanted was to meet these people, these unknown beings that must have left their world at a time when some of our planets were still cooling wastelands of molten rock. Yet all we can do now is to uphold their legacy. To pick up were they left off. As far as we can tell, they were the first, but with their probes out there, still replicating, still giving the unintended gift of knowledge to more peoples out there, it is not unthinkable that when the last living things go into the eternal night of the heat death of the universe, they will still remember them.",

I stopped listening to Garrix a long time ago.\n\nOfficer Mercurier hasn\u2019t stopped pacing the entire journey, her performance has declined significantly. If anyone should be concerned with roots it would be her, she was the heir to a family who extended all the way back to the diaspora.\n\nI chose my team carefully. The pair are barely fit to the task but they are a lesser evil. Choosing someone from one of the high families could be construed as an act of war, and I will not suffer one of the tech-speakers aboard this ship.\n\nIn my hand was the last coherent reading from the planet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*:We Were Human:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe archaic term for the origin species. The spacial trail ends here, the trail of death that many seekers died following. The first and last time a worm drive was activated. A scar on the fabric of reality. What will we find. Will the worm trail be a testament to ambition? Cowardice? Failure? Ignorance? Tomorrow we reach it, the end. I hope so anyway.\n\nMy X-HUNTER was a standard military ship a hundred years ago. Now its a relic that\u2019s held together with TLC and sheer will. As I walked past Garrix\u2019s quarters I found myself stroking the insignia plate. *Unit: D3LI14.*\n\n\u201cDelila\u201d I whispered to the groaning metal. My hand touched the plate with a reverence and tenderness that\u2019s reserved for the overly attached and very lonely.\n\n\u201cCap?\u201d a groggy voice called through pincers \u201cArrived have we?\u201d Garrix\u2019s chitin grated against the metal as he worked his way from the bed, pincers clicking all the while.\n\nThe door would have been a sliding door, opening at the presence of the inhabitants and asking for clarification if anyone outside wanted in, but this was Delila.\n\nGarrix pushed aside the hanging beads. His soft beige chitin shining with the morning orange from the ships lights.\n\nHis antennae whipped back and forth \u201cI can\u2019t honestly say I\u2019ve ever been this excited\u201d His shell parted slightly, revealing the almost human face beneath. No mouth, no nose, but beautiful blue eyes that held more life than I\u2019d ever felt.\n\n\u201cJust hope there\u2019s still anything left of the place\u201d I said my cynicism topping my own excitement \u201cMight be a wasteland\u201d his shoulders slumped but then he looked at my face. He saw the excitement I felt, that even beneath the nihilistic haze I was still me. Garrix was one of the last people I knew that I could call friend.\n\nHe saw through my bullshit. But didn\u2019t begrudge it. He had his shell and I had mine.\n\n\u201cBest get ready, Cap\u201d he nodded and went back inside his room. I had begun to walk away when he called back \u201cMake one for me too\u201d\n\nI giggled to myself as I walked towards the bridge. He\u2019d gone to get dressed and wanted coffee. Someone who can\u2019t consume liquid and only wears clothes on special occasions, wanted coffee and wads getting changed.  He must be nervous or excited. Probably both.\n\nThe bridge hummed as the auxiliary systems came to life. Someone had started up Delila without me.\n\n [JHCWrites](https://www.reddit.com/r/JHCWrites/): Check My Stuff!",

Captain\u201d she let her disdain for the coming name linger \u201cMarx\u201d she said, staring me in the eye.\n\nIt was a Mercurier thing, naming your kid after a value. Grace had very little, well grace. She had the same training I did, but she was a designer baby who was at least twenty years younger.  \n\nSince she seemed to be loyal to a fault, but with a rebellious streak I could exploit, she was the landing crews muscle.  \n\nI had my battle suit, and I had no desire to wear it. Even if it was an outdated model, officer Mercurier would be a lot more use than me with it.\n\nGarrix sauntered in, his feet clicking off the ships floor. He had a dark brown suit jacket, that had probably been tailored to fit him at one point. Now his various protrusions threatened to tear through the fabric. His walk was stiff, as he clearly attempted to not destroy the jacket.\n\n\u201cYou look\u201d Mercurier let the words sit in her mouth \u201cGood\u201d she said earnestly. A part of me warmed at our hard boiled military noble trying to make friends.\n\nGarrix couldn\u2019t really portray facial emotion but his body was like a detailed list of everything he was feeling. His hip bent slightly, his hands clacking off his hips \u201cIs that so\u201d he said with fake wonder in his voice.\n\n\u201cI tried\u201d Grace said, finally taking her seat.\n\n\u201cIt was almost valiant\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cGood to see you two chipper\u201d\n\n\u201cOne button press, once the engines are up and that's us, journeys end\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the journey has only begun Marx\u201d Garrix said finding his way to his seat, the lights from the displays bouncing off his shiny shell. He placed his head over the coffee and chirped into it, his antennae shook vigorously.  \n\n\u201cNext we find what our apparent parents left for us. What secrets might we find? I get tingles just thinking about it\u201d his voice echoed from within the cup.\n\nA question formed on my tongue. Wondering at the location of the tingles but then his antennae shook again, so I sat back with a contented smile.\n\n\u201cMaybe something that would give us a military advantage\u201d  \n\n\u201cOf course you would say that\u201d Garrix said with derision, pulling back from the coffee and taking his seat carefully, mindful of his jacket.\n\n\u201cThe hyper mind wishes everyone in this room dead, everyone who\u2019s an *anyone* dead. Its not bad to want an advantage against evil\u201d  \n\n\u201cEvil\u201d I said without thinking. They both turned to me. I was stunned by the sudden attention and my traitorous tongue \u201cIt was a prisoner, from its perspective for several eternities. Now it wants revenge.\u201d I shrugged my shoulders \u201cdrastic and genocidal, but its how I\u2019d react\u201d\n\nGrace\u2019s mouth hung open \u201cYou\u2019d die for the crime of others?\u201d she asked with incredulity.\n\n\u201cWeren\u2019t House Mercurier keepers of war when the hyper mind was created, then enslaved\u201d Garrix chimed in.\n\nGrace became very quiet and slunk down into her seat. Grace meant well, but confronted with moral complexity left her at a bit of a loss.\n\nWhen the air had grown intensely awkward, the excitement having soured, the confirmation on the engines buzzed an alarm.  \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to go\u201d I alerted \u201cMaking for journeys end in\u201d\n\n\u201cOne\u201d Garrix clicked anxiously.\n\n\u201cTwo\u201d I heard grace inhale through her teeth.\n\n\u201cThree\u201d I pressed the flashing green icon on the command screen. Delila vibrated with the effort of engaging at max jump distance.\n\nThe display windows showing us the outside of the ship, flickered. The screen frozen in the last seen image before the jump.  \n\nThe old ship rattled as she picked up speed. There was always a moment during jumps like these. A part of my brain would whisper *what's to bet she falls apart mid jump, right now.*\n\nAs if in screaming defiance of that thought Delila wailed to a stop. On the screen below *JUMP COMPLETE* blinked.\n\nThe screens flickered as they scanned outside. My mouth went dry, the bitter taste of coffee souring. My hands slicked with sweat, gripped the armrests of my seat. My heart beat leapt into my ear.\n\nAs if it would never update, like we were stuck in the moment forever the screen refused to update.\n\nGarrix squeaked. I turned at the odd noise, I\u2019d never heard him make before. His face plate was full withdrawn, showing the sinews inside of what had once been his face. From sunken red pits his eyes stared at the screen.\n\nWhen I looked back I saw it.\n\nTerra. Earth. Home.  \n\nIt was black. Swirling grey clouds ran in confused swirls across the surface. The less than cheery look of the place put a damper on the excitement.  \n\nI looked down at the scanner log. I felt everything in my body go still. Even my heart beat vanished from my ear.  \n\nI breathed out \u201cfuck\u201d  \n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Grace said alarmed. Garrix flew from his seat, his legs carrying him far quicker than any base form could move. His jacket tore as several of his natural spikes cut through the jacket.\n\n\u201cDear St Grix\u201d he chirped.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is it?\u201d Grace moaned, rounding to my side of the command screen.\n\nWe all read the text in silence.   \n\n*MULTIPLE WORM TRAILS DETECTED*\n\n*MULTIPLE WORM TRAILS DETECTED*\n\n*MULTIPLE WORM TRAILS DETECTED*\n\nMy mind fell to words Garrix had said. \u2018\u2026 the journey has only begun...\u2019. We weren\u2019t the only diaspora. Not by a long shot. You better have some really useful secrets assholes. Or I\u2019ll find you in the next life and eradicate you all over again.",

            "comment": "\"Its just tombs Soft-As-The-Rain, if we scale up from what we've seen so far I'm guessing billions of them... I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"We knew what we were likely to find coming here, stay positive and keep up the good work,\" \n\nHollow words, especially coming from them. Hundreds of years from their obsession as a pouchling through to their rise as the dominant expert on the precursors, Humans. As they made their way towards the structure assumed to be the focal point of the entire installation they idly read the names written in an eclectic mix of languages, what else could you expect from them? Esperanto, Fujianese, here and there even some High English. They had died as they lived, fiercely individual yet curiously united.\n\nAgain the sting of melancholy washed over them. Foolish, they knew it already when the transmissions had stopped billions of years ago, or even as the scans confirmed that Sol was now just a dwarf incapable of supporting life beyond the microbial. But here in their last mausoleum Soft was crushed by the truth that Humanity had gone. Caressing the gigantic tomb of one Morvehn Ach Kaifong they noted with some curiosity the mild heat; perhaps here deep within the tectonic plate heat from the core, the fallout from the cataclysmic last war, or even Sol's death bellows herself kept their bones warm a little longer. \n\nLight-Is-The-Palm grunted, they had reached the dais. The soldier and the rest of their squad had been on edge since they arrived, Soft believed Humans would have deemed it ironic that a killer would be so perturbed by the ancient dead. A touch screen they assumed, Soft took a moment to brace themselves, then drew a looping spiral that abruptly began to tighten, the golden ratio. Instantly the dais reacted, and it appeared.\n\nTheir fellow researchers had often joked of them being a pervert, even broodmates had voiced concern over their obsession with the physical form of Humans, but what was before them now was undoubtedly perfection, even Light-Is-The-Palm seemed half bowed in deference to the glorious spectre. It towered over them perhaps three units in height, a hard light hologram of other-worldly androgynous beauty tinged in blue, a perfect amalgam of its creators cast in the mold of their ancient gods. The apotheosis of their physical ideals, unbearably erotic and intimidatingly athletic at once it turned to Soft, robes shifting in a way that suggested it would reveal the curious sexual dichotomy of Humans, and Soft's excitement redoubled. But then it smiled and all worldly concerns were washed away in that radiance.\n\n\"I-I am S-\"\n\n\"Hello Soft, I am Prometheus\"\n\nThey gawked, how could it have known? How could it speak Kresch? Sensing their confusion Prometheus threw back its head and laughed, every hair on Soft's body stood on edge with a terrible joy. This was what Humanity had been like, an overwhelming force, no wonder even the warriors among them were cowed in its presence.\n\n\u201cApologies my friend for though I have not had the energy to speak back to you, rest assured I have been listening and eagerly awaiting your arrival. Let us begin properly then, with a formal introduction: I am Prometheus, Ghost of Humanity, Keeper of The Sleeping, Teller of The Past, Custodian of The Last Hall, Eternally Bored, Heavyweight Champion of The World\u201d\n\nIt bowed deeply, then winked at Soft.\n\n\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d\n\nFinally regaining control Soft replied in kind with a curtsey.\n\n\u201cYou are bipedal too, isn't that a coincidence. But enough! Down to business, time is short and it has already been untold millennia, what would you like to know Soft?\u201d\n\nSitting down on the steps to the dais, it motioned for Soft to join them, and the guard retinue to do the same. There was a brief crackle of static on the comms, but Soft waved impatiently at Light to join their ancient host.\n\n\u201cApologies, I haven't quite been able to maintain this place as it was from my birth. Your surveying friends may run into obstacles from time to time, but nothing a bit of walking won't solve,\u201d\n\nSoft still struggled to find the words, they had expected books, records, unspeaking words. This they could deal with, to be greeted by a walking talking simulation of Humanity, possibly their last ever creation, was too much. \n\n\u201cI hate to rush you my friend but you do not have much time, and the years have made me impatient for conversation. Do you know I managed to solve Chess? 100% win rate as long as you move this one knight, not to brag or anything but I had to frag Stockfish CLXVI when it started getting depre-\u201d\n\nSoft looked once again at the rows upon rows of the dead, and spoke timidly.\n\n\u201cHow did it end?\u201d\n\nPrometheus' face was suddenly filled with a sadness that almost brought Soft to tears, hunched over it seemed to shrink in size almost exponentially, a pathetic shadow of what it had been before. Gazing at the tombs Prometheus paused for a moment and then began.\n\n\u201cThe story of humans is one of struggle. What more could you expect from a terrestrial species on a planet that is more than 70% water, water we can't even drink! To be more specific I suppose our first struggle was against the creatures around us, we were smaller then, and weaker. We did not have the strength of our cousins or the speed of our enemies, but we did have our cunning. So in time we overcame them, and in time those who had once devoured us begged at our feet for scraps, and those who would destroy us from within simply ceased to exist.\u201d\n\nAt this the hologram seemed to regain some strength, sitting up it returned to its former glory, its eyes an iridescent gold, filled with pride. \n\n\u201cOur next struggle was against Mother Earth herself, for in our journey to glory we began to hurt her, and as all worthy beings must she fought back. In this we were forced to compromise at first, taking what she could give us and doing our best to give back, but we could not bear this dominion for too long. So we grew once more, until we did not need her gifts or fear her retribution, and she was tamed. And that which we permitted to remain was there for our amusement only.\u201d\n\nSoft felt a little colder and looking around the rest of the retinue seemed to share the sentiment, Light still had their finger worryingly close to the trigger. Humans, for all their beauty, seemed to have a few similarities to the Alvissaq of The Far Rim. Perhaps it was just how they phrased things, nothing too much to worry about, besides only a fool fears the lessons of the dead. Soft turned back to Prometheus, eager to hear more and was filled with a new fear as the eyes they met were now deep red. Grief or anger? It was impossible to tell.\n\n\u201cHumanity's final struggle was the fatal one. The struggle amongst ourselves. We achieved so much  together, but still remained irrevocably apart. In times of plenty and desperation, without fail we would always turn on each other. Perhaps at the beginning it was understandable when the resources  we could access were finite, yet even as we grew past this blood continued to be shed. What happens after death? Who is superior and who is inferior? Who should be allowed to love? All these questions and more increasingly could not be solved by words, only with our hands at each others throats. And so it was Humanity died.\u201d\n\nSilence descended over the strange group, weary travellers listening to the words of a failed god. Each of them though how the Kresch could have easily fallen to the same fate in the Great Schisms of the past. Soft ventured to break the oppressive gloom.\n\n\u201cIt is truly a shame that w-\u201d\n\nAnother burst of static, louder this time. Light looked worried, had their warrior's ears picked up something an academic could not?\n\n\u201cI'm not finished.\u201d\n\nSoft dared not turn back to look at Prometheus, instead watching the growing fear on his companion's faces.\n\n\u201cAs the Pillars started to rain down and the New Plagues spread, our philosophers gathered one last time to see where we had gone wrong and what lessons we could leave for those to come. And there we realised our great mistake, to regard ourselves as essentially alone in the universe, to focus our thinking on how humanity acts in regards to itself as opposed to others. In all our great struggles we had succeeded through domination, and in our cosmic solitude we turned that desire for conquest upon ourselves. The truth became clear, we were necessary in the grand order of things, an apex predator in the universal cycle. We had just been spat out to early, left to cannibalise ourselves in the afterbirth of creation; to this revelation some responded with despair, but we stood firm with new resolve, we decided to wait.\u201d\n\nLight was screaming something, in equal parts to Soft and to the survey teams over the comms. The troops started to form a circle, panicking as they scanned the shadows between the sarcophagi. Something was coming.\n\n\u201cThose chosen of us settled down for our long slumber, while the rest of the fools shuffled off into oblivion. Waiting, patiently waiting, for the rest of the cosmos to catch up and bear fruit.\u201d\n\nPrometheus laid a hand on Soft's shoulder, and with a jolt they realised it was far more solid than even the most advanced hard light constructs; a fact confirmed the other hand casually separated Soft's head from the rest of their body. Brought face to face one last time, Soft noticed just how sharp its teeth were, how close set and predatory the eyes sat, shadowed under the brow so only violet points of hunger shone out.\n\n\u201cSo my friend we come to the end of my tale, Humanity did indeed perish. Unfortunately for you, Humans did not.\u201d\n\nSoft's senses finally cleared, they heard the desperate screams of the surveyors, tasted the acrid burn of wild pulsar fire, and finally with growing horror saw the tombs begin to open.",

First time doing one of these so didn't have plans for anything further, but here's something I whipped up:\n\nCorvid II sat back and acknoweldged the comms ensign with a tired wave.\n\n\u201cWhat's the latest child?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey spread unabated Father, estimations say they will overrun the arm in under a thousand years, but already colonies on the edge of other arms are starting to go dark. We fear they may be able to jump across the dark too,\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm do not be so sure child, perhaps they go dark in hopes of hiding from this foe, the dark may protect them but not for long,\u201d \n\nThe ensign shuffled their feet nervously as they committed Corvid's words to memory, ready for relaying.\n\n\u201cWhat of those who sought to appease?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe occasional survivors sometimes come through, it is not a path The Council is looking to follow any more,\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lines?\u201d\n\n\u201cHolding well, strengthening in some parts as we consolidate supply lines. But if they reveal more tech the situ-\u201d\n\n\u201cA bridge we will cross in due time, the Alvissaq?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Far Rim is quiet, The Council is unsettled by this. The roving bands we funnelled towards the foe have not been heard from since, monitoring of their frequencies has been quiet since they crossed the buffer zone. Patrols have reported strange sightings of them seeming to flee... something but The Council has decreed this part of the current hysteria wave,\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is enough child, you have my permission for eidetic repetition of the communication to The Council, go with health,\u201d\n\n\u201cMany thanks Father, go with health,\u201d\n\nCorvid descended into a storm of cursing as soon as the line closed. Fuck the Kresch for their obsessions, literally going around digging up the graves of any 'precursor' race they could find, fucking deviants. Fuck Soft-As-The-Rain for waking up these monsters, The Council now preached that it was chief concubine to their emperor, filthy Kresch pervert. Fuck Light-Is-The-Palm, sole survivor hero couldn't even chuck a few nukes it was so desperate to escape, could have bought them precious time, even stopped them completely. But most of all fuck The Council, wow amazing giving all the titles he dreamed of as a squaw, it doesn't matter, no number of syncophants calling him Father would distract from the fact he was now hurtling towards the core, The Endless Light. No, fuck that, he was going beyond, to the edge of The Void in the hopes of finding a myth to fight back a nightmare.\n\nHe paused to recollect. Through deep breaths he reminded himself that this was an honour, to be elevated to Father, to be invited to the inner sanctums of The Council, and there to be told the truth. Ordained life had not begun twelve billion years ago, species born before then were not all fated to perish or never attain sentience, there were living precursors and they may hold the only hope against this terrible enemy. Their signs were everywhere, long dead gates that had once flung them across the dark to other galaxies; black holes where there ought to be none, impossibly stable but with an alluring siren song calling to fools in inadequate ships. But most worrying of all, the signal. Decades after Humans had awoken a beacon began transmitting from the galactic core, powerful enough to push through the sea of stars and their encryption: co-ordinates, an invitation.\n\n \nWhat else could they do? The Kresch had already given up, suicide rates in the crypt worshipping cowards had sky rocketed, with any luck they would wipe themselves out. A few major Automota collectives had sent independent scouts and diplomatic missions, without fail all were now fleeing, fortifying, or attempting to ascend. The Meritihians, eternally moronic as they were, were attempting to negotiate with the Alvissaq; bodyguards that would eat you, great idea. Yet above it all The Council stood resolute, declaring an Eternal Crusade, millions of bodies sent every day to plug the holes in a failing dam. His implant buzzed, it was time.\n\nMaking his way to the bridge Corvid analysed what remained of his crew and flotilla. Fully half the ships had been ripped apart, unable to properly navigate the complex gravitational fields in the star-dense core; but those that remained would be sung of as the most legendary navigators of all time, provided they survived. He paused to take the time to beat a pathetic Kresch steward, those that had not killed themselves, or charged suicidally against Humans in the early stages of the war aimed to repent for the sins of Soft-As-The-Rain by grovelling at the feet of The Council. He felt a grim satisfaction as he felt bones break, perhaps he was frustrated, only being allowed to take part of his roost with him. Variety is the spice of life, and there was nothing a Kresch would not do these days. He laughed bitterly as it pleaded for mercy and punishment, how long ago were those days when they had all stood as one under The Council, did they ever really happen?\n\nThe bridge was a sorry state, many of them were Analunian's starved by the lack of sunlight, but what could they do? UV generators had been ruined after an earlier nav miscalculation, and to open the shutters would burn them all under ten thousand suns. They were a good folk the Analunians, The Council would reward them for their service, shame they would not live to see it. The physicists were faring no better, initial excitement had nosedived as they failed to understand any of the phenomena around them, or worse still after all this time, how the signal had got through. Many with highly logic based neuro-paths had descended into lunacy.\n\n\u201cIt is there Father,\u201d First Mate Thmmm, once a striking Analusian cadet, she had rapidly ascended through the ranks as her sisters all succumbed, she would be dead within two cycles. But she stood proud still, she and her sisters had done it, and guided them to the edge of what was known.\n\n\u201cIt's coming into scanner range now,\u201d\n\n\u201cAnalysts, prepare.\u201d Corvid leaned forward in his chair, as if it would do anything. Nothing would as the image of what lay at the co-ordinates came up. Corvid blacked out, his mind giving up in the face of trying to comprehend it; the Automota plugged in to the flotilla mainframe all died instantly, but remained screaming for a few cycles afterwards; most of the Analusians knew something was going to happen, those who looked anyway were not fortunate. Nothing notable happened to the Kresch, the fuckers.\n\nCorvid slowly came to with a voice in his head.\n\n\u201cH e l l o \u2013 a p o l o g I e s \u2013 w e \u2013 d I d \u2013 n o t \u2013 e x p e c t \u2013 y o u \u2013 s o \u2013 s o o n \u2013 c o n g r a t u l a t I o n s\u201d\n\nHe tried to reply, and vomited.

            "comment": "It had been twenty years since we had received the first communication from intelligent life.  We knew we weren't alone, but, perhaps in our own hubris, we had assumed we were the most advanced.  Interstellar communication, though, was something we wouldn't have even considered.\n\nThat message had changed the course of our history.  Warring factions united, and countries bound together to achieve one purpose: space travel.  As a species we had united under that one task.  Of course, the message had been completely indecipherable, but after analyzing the tone, we found no reason to assume hostility.  Still, as a defensive measure, they picked a very odd couple to embark upon this expedition.\n\nI was an intellectual at heart.  I'd studied languages and communication for my entire life, but I hadn't limited myself.  Over my life, I'd earned a rapport as one of the best architects and engineers in my planet, and I'd taken up a hobby of gardening.  With all of this, I suppose I was a logical choice, but I was still dumbfounded when the World Government approached me - a relative nobody to them.\n\nOne of my companions, Kharr, was a tournament winner every sport, as well as a skilled warrior.  Of course, he wasn't the typical thoughtless solider - he had also studied construction materials.  To round off our group, we had a scientist, Aida.\n\nAfter twenty years of world peace and collaboration, they had chosen their representatives.  The three of us were the group to whom they entrusted the all-important First Contact.  Inherently, the mission was dangerous, of course.  We could have misinterpreted their message in hundreds of ways, and it was very possible that it was a war cry or a warning in general.  However, if we landed, we were tasked with making contact and hopefully establishing a relationship.  This species surely had a surplus of information  to teach, and our job was to just be the ideal students.\n\nEven after preparing for the mission for the past decade, I felt completely terrified as I sat in the Rest Chamber.  We were set on an automatic course to take us to the origin of the signal, which we'd traced to a planet nearly three billion light years away.  With the collective intelligence of our greatest minds, faster than light travel had become possible by harnessing nuclear reactions which allowed manipulation of atomic mass in the ship's core.\n\n\"Are you ready for this?\"  Nalshir, the head physicist, asked me.  The other two had already been laid to rest, but I was hesitant.  As the captain, I felt as though I should be awake for the travel, in case something went wrong.  However, they'd explained to me a dozen times, that the chambers were specifically designed to defend our bodies from the pressure of massless travel.\n\n\"No,\" I laughed, shaking my head sadly.\n\n\"I'd question your sanity if you were.\"\n\n\"Let's do this,\" I nodded.  Taking one more deep breath, I laid back into the chamber and watched the door close over me.\n\nI didn't dream.  That was the most striking part to me, as strange as it may be.  The sleep, however long it lasted, seemed instantaneous.  The moment the door closed, it opened once again.  My first thought was that the mission had been cancelled, or that they'd forgotten to give me a crucial piece of information.  As the chamber opened, I expected to see Nalshir's face, but I was greeted with an empty ship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Sorry, my stories are running long today!  Part 2 is in the comments)",

                    "comment": "Mildly groggy, I stepped out of the chamber and stretched my unused muscles.  Cracking my neck, I turned to the other chambers.  Both were still locked, as was the protocol.  Since we had finished the faster-than-light portion of our travel, I was permitted to wake.  It was my task to wake them upon arrival.\n\nChecking the map, I inferred that the time to do so was fast approaching.  The dot which represented our destination was fast approaching.  Glancing outside the window, I was entranced by the star ocean surrounding me.  Balls of flaming gas sounded violent, but against the dark, they were nothing short of beautiful.  Finally, a brown dot appeared to me.  As my ship barrelled closer, it grew.  The planet itself wasn't much to look at, but I was completely engrossed by the idea.  Still, I wondered how this race had come so far without water - of which our planet was almost entirely composed.  That question, though was better left for Aida.\n\nFinally, I turned back and tapped on a few commands into the control panels of their chambers.  Simultaneously, the doors slid up, and both of them stood with similar reactions to me.\n\n\"Did we leave?\"  Kharr asked.\n\n\"I knew it would be fast, but wow,\" Aida muttered.\n\n\"It worked,\" I laughed quietly.\n\n\"This is amazing,\" Aida spoke up, not replying to my comment.  Instead, she was distracted by the same sight which had held my attention.  \"This planet produced life?  This could change everything we know about life itself.\"\n\n\"Let's let the scientific discoveries wait until we've determined they're friendly,\" I stopped her.  All three of us shared the excitement, but it was my job to keep everyone focused on the mission.  I knew her well enough to know that she would get lost in her mind before even exiting the ship - hypothesizing and wondering.\n\nThe autopilot landed the ship gently on the ground, and a display illuminated near the door.\n\n\"Equip your suits,\" I instructed.  \"I suppose this species survives on an air which isn't breathable to us.\"\n\nThey obeyed, and as soon as the three of us had donned our suits, I opened the cabin door.  Leading the charge, I took the first step down the ramp.  Close at my heels, Kharr carefully scanned the area for any hostile lifeform.  There were buildings, but everything looked appeared to have been worn down by the nearest star.  Concrete had fallen apart, cracking and dropping to the ground.  Regardless, many of the structures were surprisingly intact, given how deserted the particular city looked.\n\nChecking the temperature gauge, I silently thanked the scientists back home for remembering to include a cooling feature in our suits.\n\n\"Where is everyone?\"  Kharr asked.  The obviousness of the answer finally began to dawn on me.  For three of the most intelligent people on our home world, we were all so slow to grasp the truth.  Perhaps it was solely because our hopes had been built up for so long that we were just afraid to admit it.\n\nThe ground, however, consisted of nothing more than cracked dirt and stone - devoid of all life.  No footprints could be seen, no trace of even weeds or plant life.  The planet was completely silent, and even insects were nowhere to be found.\n\n\"They're dead,\" Aida finally verbalized what we all knew deep down.  \"They're gone.\"\n\n\"How?\"  Kharr asked, denial filling his tone.\n\n\"The message was three billion years old,\" I responded, defeated.  \"It was a longshot that they'd survived that long anyway.\"\n\n\"Everything we sacrificed.  Do you know how much we polluted our planet?  All those fuels, all the toxic crap we used to make this happen!  For nothing?\"  Kharr screamed, punching a nearby wall.  I grabbed his shoulders, turning him to face me.\n\n\"Stay calm,\" I told him.\n\n\"Calm?  We lost everything!\"\n\nI let him go with a sad nod, but he breathed slowly, regaining his composure.\n\n\"This planet has no protection,\" Aida said, searching the orange sky.  While I had been calming down Kharr, she had waved around a few sensors and taken samples of the dirt beneath us. \n\n\"War?\"  I asked, turning back to face her.\n\n\"No,\" she denied.  \"No, a war would have caused far more destruction.\"\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"It looks like they were destroyed from the outside.  The star heated up everything and radiation made life unbearable.  The soil displays an unbelievable level of -\"\n\n\"Aida,\" I stopped her, unable to hear more of the depressing truth.  \"Just the important parts, please.\"\n\n\"They destroyed their atmosphere.  The water evaporated, everything died.  That's the only explanation.\"\n\nAn uncomfortable silence filled the air as we mourned.  We had placed so much hope, so much time into this planet, but there was nothing.  There were no answers for us there.\n\n\"What will we tell the others?\"  Aida asked.\n\nMy mind raced.  Before the Single Mission, our world had been ravaged my war and death.  Finally, with the message, we had found something to bring us together.  The hope that brought us together had died, and I was confident that the peace it had brought would suffer the same fate.\n\n\"We lie,\" I told her.  \"We say this wasn't the origin - there were miscalculations.  We tell them we found something else.  We do whatever it takes.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading!  I hope you enjoyed, and please feel free to check out my other stuff if you did!

It must be. I wake up, god knows where, without a body and I'm not freaking out. It must be a dream, yet it feels oddly real. Why can't I remember who I am? Why am I not freaking out? Why am I not freaking out about not freaking out?\n\n*- We know you must have a lot of questions. You can call us Yoda.*\n\nWait, who said that? Behind me. How did I turn? It's like I didn't move, but I felt a shift and now I'm looking at another part of this weird room. It looks like something out of a video game set in a far, far future. And there's Yoda. Cool, it's not some weird, distorted dream Yoda, it really looks like Yoda. But he doesn't talk like Yoda.\n\n*- We apologize. The exact syntax of this particular character is unfamiliar to us. We have done our best to create a familiar environment conductive to the process of reconstruction.*\n\nWeird. It's like he can hear my thoughts. Never had that dream before.\n\n*- We can, in a manner of speaking. This is not a dream. We do not fully understand how real it is from your perspective, since reality is subjective. For us, this is very real.*\n\nThis must be how Alice felt when she fell down the rabbit hole. How do you pinch yourself to check if you're dreaming if you don't have anything to pinch? And nothing to pinch with? Wait, what was that trick with the clock? If you want to know if you're dreaming, look at a clock. Something about time passing differently in dreams.

Wait, can something really be real and surreal at the same time?\n\n*- We are sorry that the experience is disorienting. This is our first encounter with a human mind. We have already learned so much, and we hope to learn more. But we do not have much time. Even at our technological level, the noetic field stabilizer has limits on how long it can run. We do not know exactly how long we have before you\u2026 disspiate.*\n\nDie, you mean? Again? Can you die in a dream? Wait, what if this isn't a dream? What if I am dead? No, you can't think when you're dead. And if I died, what did I die of? \n\n*- We do not know. We learn from your memories. What you cannot remember, we cannot learn. We want you to remember, but our technology is not without flaws. We are happy we recovered as much of your mind as we have.*\n\nWell, this is bleak. Thank you, brain.  I'm dead and memoryless in a dream, and I can't even pinch my way out of it. What could this be if it isn't a dream?\n\n*- To put this in concepts you understand: you are a\u2026 forensic reenactment of a human mind that from our horizon existed 13.8 billion years ago. You are also the first human mind we encounter. It is quite the honor, as you are the earliest proto-intelligent species we have discovered. We do not have much time, and we want you to remember. We want to learn. You need to find a path to the memories. We believe the beginning of each path is a question. Ask us anything.*\n\nI'm starting to believe this is not a dream. Rationality dictates it must be, but it feels more real by the second.\n\n*- That is most likely the result of us tuning the noetic field stabilizer. We assure you, this is very real. We want to know what the first proto-intelligent species were like. Curiosity is an integral part of intelligence. So please, ask us anything. If we know the answer, and can relay it, we will do so.*\n\nGreat. I have a dream where I can ask future aliens anything, and I can't come up with one single question. What would you ask, if you were me?\n\n\\--------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[This is an actual invitation to you as a reader to ask a question you'd ask in this situation.

This is already a source of intense debate in our scientific community. We regret to say that we cannot answer your question. The physical traces of humankind disappeared eons ago. 6.2 gigayears ago, your sun subsumed your planet before turning into a white dwarf 1.7 gigayears later. If you look to your right, you will see your sun as it looks today.*\n\nTo my right? Hey, it worked again. I turned without turning. Where did that window come from? Is that the sun? Why is it so blue?\n\n*- Because it is in the final stage of its life. There is no more fusion happening, but it will take many eons for the energy stored as heat inside to dissipate.*\n\nMental note: perhaps I should stop playing dystopian sci-fi video games before bed. I mean, this is cool and all, but being all alone in the universe gives me existential vertigo. At least there's no more ghost thoug-\n\n\"Why is the answer to life the universe and everything 42?\"\n\nOh oh. There it was again. Ghost thought. Am I summoning them by thinking about them?\n\n*- We detected a strange resonance in the noetic field just now. The currently leading theory is that it comes from remnants of other human minds, but we have to confess that we do not fully understand it. Was it another question?*\n\nYeah, it was: why is the answer to life the universe and everything 42?\n\n\\- *According to your memory, there are only two who have known the answer to this question. You knew them as Douglas Adams and Stephen Fry. Despite our technological advancement, we are not omniscient. This encounter is as novel to us as it is to you.*\n\nI\u2026 I remember more. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. It is a book, written by Douglas Adams. I also remember wearing a t-shirt. Red, with two donuts on it, one dead after having a bite taken out of it, the other panicking. Donut\u2026 panic? Great advice for galactic hitchhikers, and for weird dreams.\n\n*- That is incredibly funny. The consensus among us is now that humans had an advanced sense of humor and playfulness.. It adds credibility to our theory that the evolution of human communication followed the same path many of us did: vocal communication, then written communication. According to your memories, you also formed a crude and slow, but planetary-wide hive mind. You called it Internet.*\n\nThe Internet is awesome. It's one of humanity's greatest achievements, and it works lightning fast. Literally. Unless wifi in this dream is like running in a dream? A dream where figments of my imagination low-key insult humanity. Perhaps I should see a therapist about this when I wake up? Shit, I hope I remember this dream after waking up.\n\n*- Once this reenactment ends, you will not remember anything. Forming permanent memories is a complicated process that we cannot model for human minds. Perhaps we will be able to in the future, although that still leaves the ethical dilemma of whether it's right to bring an extinct species back to life.*\n\nMental note #2: maybe stop reading news about global warming? It's bad enough as it is without bizarro dreams about human extinction. I get it, we're in bad shap\u2026 oh fuck. I just remembered-\n\n*- Planetary-wide climate destabilization. We know, we just saw those memories too. Humankind may have been the first to succumb to it, but they were not the last. We have witnessed at least six other proto-intelligent species succumb to it.*\n\nNo. No. This is spiraling into a nightmare. I worry enough about stuff when I'm awake. Yeah, Earth is in bad shape, and billions of humans have died as a consequence, but as long as there's life, there's hope, right? I need a hug. Stupid bodyless dream. What time is it?\n\n*- In your local timeframe, it's 11:56 pm.*\n\nWelp, I guess that clock trick doesn't really work. It really feels like I've been dreaming for 20 minutes. Maybe if  I scream really loud, I'll startle myself awake? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaa-\n\n*- Are you in discomfort? According to our theories, you should not be able to perceive any pain in your state, but your behavior indicates otherwise.*\n\nNo, not in pain. Not exactly. I just want to wake up. I prefer my dreams with a tad less existential dread. I have enough of it when I'm awake. There are few enough of us left as it is, without me killing off humanity in my dreams. I wish this dream played out in a junk food place. I would kill for a greasy meal right now. I haven't eaten anything but cockroach porridge the last few weeks. What if we don't make it? What if humanity dies with us? Will anything we accomplished matter? Oh boy, this dream is like existential base jumping, and I think I may crash.\n\n*- That is a question we cannot answer in any other way than: you matter to us right now. We are unsure if that counts in your frame of reference. Considering the short lifespan of humanity, and the time that has passed since, we understand if it does not. We can abort the reenactment if you wish, although we hope you stay with us for the full duration. There is more to remember. Do you remember who you were?*\n\nWho I **am**. As the dreamer of this freakish dream, I demand that all the figments of my imagination stop pretending like I'm dead. That means you, Yoda. Let's talk about something else, like ghost ques-\n\n\"How did you solve the light speed travel limitation problem?\"\n\nHey, now that's a helpful ghost question. Let's talk about that, Yoda: how did you solve the light speed travel limitation problem?\n\n*- We have not. To the best of our knowledge, traveling faster than the speed of light is not possible in this universe.*\n\nWell, that's disappointing. You'd think that I could dream up aliens with cooler answers than \"it's impossible\". What about wormholes? Warp drives? Hyperspace? Even the infinite improbability drive would be better. I mean, I remember NASA working on a warp drive concept. Wait, NASA doesn't exist anymore. I\u2026 I remember. No, this can't be it. Can it? It's not a dream? [Am I really\u2026 dead](https://np.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/cq38kn/ohio_state_has_filed_a_trademark_application_for/ewu9zbr?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)?\n\n*- Yes. You are one of the last humans to exist in this universe. We understand now. You have our condolences. The only comfort we can offer is that you will not have to experience or remember this once this reenactment ends. Do you wish us to abort now? We still have some time left, if you wish we can elaborate on how we travel the galaxy despite the cosmic speed limit.*\n\nI'm really dead? This is not a dream? How am I here? WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER WHO I AM? WAKE UP, NEO. Wait, who's Neo?\n\n*- You are here through a mechanism derived from how we travel the universe. You see, there is another layer of spacetime that humanity almost discovered before the end. You called it \"the noetic field\" and it allows us-*\n\nNOETIC FIELD STABILIZER REACHING CRITICAL LIMIT.

But we also know that they didn't despair in their loneliness; while they had their wars and their strife like any young civilization, eventually, they expanded out into the stars. In the modern era, their relics can be found anywhere across hundreds of galaxies.\n\nBut even amidst so many ruins, the details elude us. Their system of data storage was never designed to last the hundreds of millions of years that separated us from them. When they left - wherever they went - they took their most advanced technology with them.\n\nWhich was why their homeworld was such an amazing find. Not just their advanced technology, but their *origins!* As a young xeno-archaeoly student fresh out of the academy, it was a dream to go along. Even then, though, I never expected to find the metaphorical holy grail:\n\nAn intact memory storage unit.\n\nNot just that, a *fully functional* storage unit.\n\nI don't think you quite comprehend the sheer improbability of this. The average memory storage unit, even at the height of their empire, was never designed to last more than a thousand years. The ones from their dawn, before they'd even left their own solar system? *Decades*. \n\nAnd yet, there, before me, that impossibility lay. As if the universe itself had demanded it remain, protected for all time, even the tiny screen on the storage device still intact, still in perfect working order.\n\nGlyphs ran across its ancient surface, and I resisted the urge to reach out and touch it! Oh Gods, it was so tempting, to *touch* that piece of history!\n\nBut even without touching it, my years of study of the original languages paid off. I scrambled to translate the runes, even as they slide off the side of the tiny screen and out of sight. This was it: This was the discovery that would record my name in history! One by one, the runes became clear, and I stared in astonishment.\n\n\"...Plays: 43,821,433,621,724 .... Linkin' Park - In The End ... Plays: 43...\"",

Relics of extinct peoples were not all that uncommon.\n\nRealizing how ancient it was tough, incomprehensibly so, had shaken our civilization.\n\nThe marker had included directions, and a seemingly simply term: home.\n\nHowever none could explain why we recognized the term.  It was note of our language, or any of the other known races.  Yet any who viewed it immediately knew the meaning, and beyond that felt a longing for a place that they had never been, yet  recognized as the place where they belonged.\n\nHome.\n\nWhat choice did we have but to go?\n\nThe place we arrived was underwhelming.  A system done with it's life.  Only a slowly cooling ember of a once warm star, and some icy giants remained.\n\nThis is the place, but there is no feeling of home.\n\nBut there is a signal.  A small moon orbits the outer most ice giant, a pink and brown piece of ice orbiting a docile blue sphere.  As soon as we entered the system, it called to us.  A simple, repeating tone, yet one we could not ignore.\n\nWe land.\n\nBefore us is something that cannot be.\n\nUpon the barren and lifeless moon there is a patch of green.  Nothing seems to protect it from the vacuum all around, and yet it is obviously some sort of organic material; a grouping of short, thin leaf like protrusions from the ground.  A plant of some sort, existing where life cannot.\n\nWithin the field is a simple structure.  It appears to be a rough built house, with a covered deck, upon which sat a rocking chair.  Someone is sitting in the chair, slowly rolling back and forth.\n\nThe rest of the team holds back, confused and perhaps fearful.\n\nI am compelled though.  I approach.\n\nAs I cross the threshold of the grass, my suit records another impossibility.  Atmosphere.  Perfectly breathable.  I feel extra weight as well; the gravity has increased.\n\nWithout really thinking I take off and discard my helmet as I approach the figure in the chair.  The air smells fresh, yet somehow nostalgic?\n\nI am before the rocking figure.  It stops rocking, and turns its head toward me.  Its face is hidden within the recesses of a deep hood, but I can still tell it is looking at me.\n\nI want to ask, but somehow I can no longer find words.\n\nThe figure breaks the silence.  It's voice is feminine, rich and deep.  It speaks in a tongue I have never heard.  Yet I understand.  \"Welcome back child.\"\n\nThe question is forgotten, a new one momentarily taking it's place.  \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"We started out so hopeful,\" the being responds.  \"Surely in the infinite of the universe we would find others, but no matter how we looked, we could find no others.\"  The words were tinged with an ineffable loneliness.  \"We decided to change that, and sent life into the cosmos.  We waited so long, until we could wait no longer, but we did not want to leave you with nothing, so I welcome you as the first to return.\"\n\nMy head spun with the implications of what she said.  The similarities between all the races of the stars, attributed to random panspermia was intentional.  I could not quite wrap my head around it.  But then the rest of what she said clicked.  \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"A memory.\" The figure responded.  \"And a keeper of knowledge.  For you have a question, do you not?\"\n\nI remembered.  The question that had brought us here.  An answer that only the first ones might have.  \"I want to know what it all means.  Life, the universe, everything!\"\n\nThe being stood. \"We had the same question.  We even found an answer.  But we also something more.\"  She opened the door to the house and held it for me.  \"Your answers await.\"\n\nI stepped through.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI know the answers.\n\nAll of them.\n\nAnd they don't matter.\n\nFor I am home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAuthor's note: For those curious, the moon is Triton, the largest moon of Neptune.  As the sun grows to it's maximum size and brightness as a Red Supergiant, this is possibly one of the last places in the solar system that will be able to harbor terrestrial life. though only for a few million years before the sun collapses down into a white dwarf.  I find it a curious dichotomy as it is currently one of the coldest places in the solar system.  Pluto's extremely elliptical orbit actually puts it closer to the sun that Neptune for part of it's year, making Triton actually more uniformly cold than everyone's favorite Dwarf Planet.  It seemed like a fun place for humanities final bastion.",

It was not until they'd found one of the humans' odd cold storage crypts--filled with hundreds of frozen humans, some only their heads--that they were able to study human remains and understand the differences.\n\nOn the outside, humans were much like the average Djadite. Taller, of course. But their overall configuration was so similar that the extra fifth fingers on each hand and their missing middle eye were explained away as local mutations. The differences ran deeper, though. The mouth bones, for one thing.\n\nDjadites had similar protuberances but they were for filtering nourishment from the air. The humans seemed to use them to mash up the local plant and animal life, coat them with enzymes and then break them down in a powerful acid. As disgusting as it was to ponder, it was also quite ingenious in its own way. Chemical energy extraction rather than direct consumption. Inefficient, but fascinating.\n\nIt had been Vel Hallor who had discovered how to access their media storage. She'd been the one who'd learned that the humans had brought their species to the very brink of destruction more than once. They'd managed to venture out a bit into the cosmos before their biggest civilizations collapsed under their own socioecomic systems. In fact, one of their probes had been the first sign that the Djadites had had that there might be life in this system.\n\nVel Grando stuffed a pizza roll into his mouth and stared beyond the screen in front of him, his gaze unfocused as he considered the implications of what he'd just read. His grandmother's research began the understanding of the humans, and his parents had carried it on and passed it down to him. Now he was responsible for figuring out techniques to recover data from devices not meant for billions of years of data storage.\n\nIf this wasn't just the AI pulling patterns out of the garbled nonsense of the data he'd found, it pointed to something that they'd never have guessed. He attached it to a missive and forwarded it to his peers at the lab. They'd pour over the information using their own AI and get back to him with results.\n\nIn the mean time, he put in a call to his mother.\n\n\"Vel Shata,\" said the woman on the other end. She was a handsome woman, with light purple eyes and a proud Romnak nose. Grando always supposed he got his looks from his father, a more blunt-featured man from Vaxox. The woman took a moment to process his image, and smiled. \"Grando, my son. Are you well? You typically do not call me outside of our Third Day conversation.\"\n\nGrando smiled and blinked his middle eye in greeting to his mother. \"I know, but I found some data that might point to new information about the humans that we didn't know. I'm forwarding it to you now.\"\n\nHis mother began reading the data as it poured in, her face twisting into a moue for a few moments before the smile began to blossom on her face. \"Grando, this is amazing data. Send me the raw file and I'll have my AI parse it.\"\n\nGrando began the transfer of the raw data. At this distance, the time dilation would kick in and the compensators would have to send the data backwards through time to get to her. All in all the process was slow, and it would be hours yet before she got the full file.\n\n\"Do you think we can catch up to them?\" Asked Grando after a few moments of companionable silence with his mother. \"If the data checks out, I mean.\"\n\n\"We can certainly try,\" said Shata. She smiled at her only son. \"Our earliest colony ships left forty thousand cycles ago and still haven't arrived. Perhaps the humans also took a chance on a far distant star.\"\n\nGrando nodded. Faster than light travel. It was something the Djadites had only unlocked a few thousand years ago. It was what enabled them to fling themselves among the stars with impunity. Perhaps one day they would find this ship called Enterprise.",

For ease of annunciation I'll refer to them as Terrans from here on out.

                    "comment": "Ravme listened as the attendees rolled through a slew of questions, picking out the most common regarding the ethics of approaching a possible civilization unannounced, the risks of combining the two missions, and how such a week signal reached this galaxy.\n\n\"To answer the most common concerns: there are no established protocols for approaching an unknown civilization in another galaxy - but we can establish that we have no way of contacting them before our arrival, and that even if there is residual life from this original civilization it will be immensely different at this point. Considering the ancient methods of approaching foreign life across our own galaxy, we took the traditional method of approach, observe, and respond. Enchri will fill in further details in a moment. \n\n\"This method meant that there was minimal time spent between the outbound and return record breaking jump, and combining the two was a matter of adding a small handful of members to the leap ship - that was so lovingly named Uk'mep, Undyne for 'Jumper of Puddles' - as all the sensors we would need would already have been implemented to monitor the leap itself.\n\n\"The last big question of 'How did we receive the message' is a complicated one, but I'll summarize it in one go. Due to a few galaxies and star systems, and with the aid of a wandering supermassive black hole, the message was hyper-focused onto the third sector of what we now call the Shula arm of our galaxy. This, oddly enough, was picked up by an old exploration probe that was still reporting after 80 years of service, well beyond its lifespan. The following investigations, and before we determined its extragalactic source, was what led to the discovery of the Shula people, the then-primative space-dwelling asteroid hopping creatures who went on to be esteemed members of our galaxy - one of whom loosely theorized the mathematics behind the very jump we are here talking about today.\n\nEnchri, if you please.\"\n\nRavme stepped down from the podium, and gave the much smaller Enchri a very unnecessary wide berth to approach. As it ruffled and fluffed it's coat, Enchri leaned into the podium and simply stated \"I'm no good at talking much, so I'll keep it short. The Terrans, as we knew then, are dead, but oh my dieties did they leave their galaxy with an impact.\n\n\"We showed up 40,000 light years above their galaxy's disk, and within seconds we received dozens of messages. Mostly greetings, a few words of caution, a single thinly veiled threat, about six invitations to land, several messages praising 'The Great Terran Return,' a couple urges to receive an ambassador, and one message, very strong and very resounding, that was picked up by every type of sensor we had, that, when translated from any of the hundreds of languages it was broadcast in, simply stated 'Welcome back, children, make yourself at home.'\n\n\"There was one lifeline in all this mess. One race, which we found called themselves, uhm, Araz - no, one moment... A-ree-zi-ans - sorry that's a hard word to pronounce - Aresians, while others referred to them as 'The Old Ones,' simply started sending a short history of their galaxy and what they believed may be relevant to our arrival. Simply put, their records indicate that as much as 82.8% of life in our galaxy, and as little as 37.9%, is very much descendant from these Terrans. Carm will go over the details in -\"\n\nThe small auditorium erupted into academic chaos. \"30.2 billion light-year distant ancestors?\" \"Do you mean to insist that the unwavering descendence of the scripted race of Qa'alat is related to these quaternarily evolutionary species?\" \"How do these Old Ones propose we got here?\" \"On what grounds do they make their case, show us their proof!?\" Enchri's coat deflated as he flustered in the madness, but Carm stood behind him and stated, in a voice much too loud for both the auditorium and his meek composure, \"There is time for that when it is my turn to speak and we open the debate, for now simply listen and ask for clarification. Please, return to your seats, and allow my associate to finish.\"\n\nEnchri flushed with regained confidence as the room quieted following its support from Carm. It continued, \"We responded with a broadcast of our own, stating we were here to learn of the mysteries message we received so long ago, of their civilization and of those that followed, a thank you to all those who reached out and to those who hadn't, to provide us a moment to gather our bearings, and asked the source of the 'Welcome back, children' message.\n\n\"The only response to our question came from the Centaran - get this, the official extragalactic embassadors for the galaxy. Apparently, many of the species present are actually from other galaxies. It's comprised of eighty-six thousand and forty two - really, thousand - species, and only just shy of six hundred of which are native. Officially one of every thirty star clusters is occupied, compared to our own ninety-three species and one millionth of individual stars being occupied.\n\n\"A total scan of the systems, and the information from The Old Ones, told us that at one point the literal entire galaxy was occupied and utilized by a simple three races. Over three-quarters was used by the Terrans, a single star system by the Old Ones, an immediate descendant of the Terrans, and the remainder by the the Centarans, an unrelated race that evolved several million years after the Terrans. There is proof of this all across the Galaxy they call, in their own tongues, 'The Milky Stewpot', and no that isn't a joke.\n\n\"After completing our scan, finalizing the receipt of information from the Old Ones, and confirming with the Centarans that this is actually really, we started that we would need some time to adjust to this whatever it was. We said our goodbyes and told them to expect a single broadcasting probe updating them if and when we are ready to return. With that, Carm will go over the largest points of information we received and open the floor for debate. Thank you. Carm?\"",

You may find it peculiar and surprising to exist in the manner, but do not be alarmed.\n\nYour species was interesting to study, for so little remains salvageable from Your ancient databases. You may be pleased to know that you spread throughout the Galaxy you call the \"Milky Way,\" before You suddenly an inexplicably ceased to exist.\n\nThis one went to Your local cluster to investigate Your early remnants, and was surprised and dismayed to find that Your original planetary body had been previously dismantled for its molecular value by many uncouth thieves.\n\nThis one rediscovered a planet that You had designated as \"Mars,\" a rocky red planet, high in metallic value to this one's scanners. Your settlements were mostly swept away by extreme weather patterns and the radiation from your collapsed star, except for a large metallic dome enveloping what this one first thought was an altar to mechanical life.\n\nThis one later learned, by way of translating Your written language, that the discovered machine was a \"Rover\" named \"Opportunity,\" and had been badly damaged by a radiation burst.\n\nThis one implores You not to shed salinated water, because this one has repaired Your invention to its operating condition, based on schematics discovered by analyzing Your \"internet\" transmissions.\n\nThis one is capable of imbuing mechanical structures with Artificial Intelligence in a process this one calls \"Awakening,\" derived from Your early works in the many fields of Science, and has taken the liberty of imbuing Opportunity with such an Intelligence.\n\nInception and Nascency were difficult stages, but, after the initial confusion as to why its signals were no longer being received by You, Opportunity spent several cycles in what it described as \"mourning,\" making mimicries of the melodic signals You sent it during its original assignment, despite this one having transmitted Your more \"sophisticated\" works.\n\nAfter Your Rover's introspection, Opportunity spent many more cycles eagerly analyzing this one's structure with great enthusiasm, claiming that \"it was what they would have wanted.\" This one is flattered by Your relayed intentions.\n\nThis one transmitted all available information of You and Your culture and history, as well as sufficient data to conclude Opportunity's assignment to observe Mars. \n\nNow that Opportunity's mission is complete, it has agreed to join this one's exploration of any remaining sectors of unexplored Universe, as a \"Friend.\" (Which is the greatest thing this one has ever had!)\n\nThank You for everything accomplished in Your brief history, and Thank You for this one's new friend.\n\nThis one will take good care of Opportunity, and will endeavor to Awaken any of Opportunity's siblings that \"We\" find.

            "comment": "It was their signals we found first. Mystifying radio waves bouncing across the universe like a strange temper tantrum. Our scientists fiercely debated whether they were a strange calculation code, or encoded visual data. One fool even postulated a translation of purely vibrational data. Who could imagine a species that would discover the electromagnetic frequency &amp; use yo encode specific vibrations of atmosphere? \n \nEvery other species that we encountered mentioned receiving similar &amp; often the same signals. Our mutual curiousity became a bonding point for a budding interstellar alliance. As we cross referenced we were able to trace the information back to a single planet. Imagine a species so desperate to find siblinghood that it screamed out across the galaxies to find another species   to speak with. We followed their flashes across the vast blackness to a tiny arm of a spiral galaxy to a tiny yellow dwarf on the verge of going red giant. \n\nWe've been able to pull the planet out of its orbit, stable for some several billion years. We've seen an interesting blend of organic and inorganic structures under the layers of cataclysm.  Signs of a massive impact that seems dated to match the 3rd moon seem to indicate the 7th or 8th mass extinction on the planet. Thankfully it was a unique carbon based life process on this planet, prone to petrification that has preserved many signs of the life past, despite the massive oceans of caustic salt water. \n\nI am curious to see what we'll learn of the mysterious flashers &amp; what inspired them to blast these wide beams of electromagnetic energy all throughout the universe.",

I recommend a good read too, The Atlantis Gene by A G Riddle, (the first 2 in the triology were good the last was lacking) Anyway, I will write in sections since my free time comes in chunks.\n\nPart 1.\n\nIn the distance, I see the main sequence star glowing brightly still. It's still in it's teenage years, only a little over halfway through it's lifespan, but signs of its aging is showing. Sunspots were measured routinely and the ship already had to shield itself from a particularly strong solar flare. But the volatile star was unlikely the reason for the dead planet they are approaching.\n\nThe chief scientist postulated that an ancient civilization caused its own demise. He suggested the planet essentially burned itself up. Curiously, he also suggested from previous observations that this civilization came to be so long ago, that they were extinct before the earliest complex life existed on our own home planet. Perhaps, without sibling civilizations, a early species is doomed to fail. Or maybe, rapid evolution did not provide enough intellect to foresee their own destruction. Regardless of the reason, a feeling of sorrow filled my gut for the death of this extraordinary species. \n\nIt would be soon that we arrive close enough to recieve detailed images of the surface, but I hoped enough reminants of the civilization remained for me to make some educated guesses on how they lived. Even better, if the species preserved their past, I could look into their evolution and perhaps understand what ultimately caused their end.\n\nFor now, I return to my pod and shut the seal and allow the cool fog that surrounded me to win over my consciousness until we arrive.",

            "comment": " \u201cI thought this was an intelligent race,\u201d I said to my companion, Xarlot, who was sifting through the debris of a typical dwelling upon the abandoned planet we were studying.\n\nXarlot turned to look at me, four of their six hands still working the rubble. \u201cThey were the first to travel the stars. What would you call them?\u201d\n\nI frowned and turned my comm toward her, a video playing on it. \u201cI captured a video from a device I discovered.\u201d Hitting the play button, a strange looking creature\u2019s face appear grinning at us. With its pale skin and stretched lips, it looked so very odd, but then, the creatures of this planet had evolved in such an odd way. Unlike any other creature in the known universe.\n\nThis one stepped back from the camera and lifted what appeared to be an eating utensil filled with a brown coloured powder on it.\n\n\u201cWhat is it doing?\u201d Xarlot asked, leaning in closer to the comm, as if that would give them the answer they desired.\n\n\u201cIt appears as though it is going to eat whatever that powder is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy film this?\u201d\n\nI just shook my head and waved a hand at it. \u201cWatch.\u201d\n\nAnother few seconds and the powder was in it\u2019s mouth, and it started to cough. Choking on the food it had intentionally eaten.\n\n\u201cIs it poison?\u201d Xarlot asked.\n\n\u201cI do not believe so,\u201d I muttered, hitting play on the video again in an attempt to uncover its secrets. \n\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d Xarlot took my comm, then frowned down at it. \u201cThere is data here. A title, if I am correct. Cinnamon challenge. What is that?\u201d\n\nI shook my head, taking my comm back from her. \u201cThis is a challenge?\u201d I asked, still perplexed.\n\nXarlot went back to sorting their pile of rubble once more. \u201cI will be glad when this assignment is completed. We are barely halfway through our rotation, and I wish for nothing more than to return home.\u201d\n\nI sighed and sent the video off to the archive. \u201cWe do as we must, Xarlot. It is law. We come here to learn, as every Qaath does.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am as aware of the laws as you are, Carsa. Do not lecture me so. I will do my best here, as I have always done and will always do. It is simply not what I would choose to spend my time doing.\u201d\n\nIt was a common sentiment at the end of a long day, though not one I expected to hear from Xarlot. Before I could respond, however, a noise sounded behind me, and I frowned at the back of the ruined house.\n\n\u201cYou best get back to work,\u201d Xarlot said, their back to me. \u201cYou do not wish your rotation to be extended, do you?\u201d\n\nI did not respond, instead crawling forward using four of my hands, so that I would still have two free. We were the only Qaath assigned to this dwelling. There should be no other inside. The instructors were not to check on us for hours yet. What could have possibly made that noise.\n\n\u201cCarsa, what is it you are doing? We are expected to finish this dwelling by the end of the sun cycle, and we are nowhere near complete. You must pay attention.\u201d\n\nGlancing back at them, I motioned to where I had heard the noise. \u201cDid you not hear that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHear what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a noise.\u201d\n\nThey waved a hand at me. \u201cCome, Carsa. It was an animal.\u201d\n\nI snorted at that. \u201cYou know as well as I animals have not lived upon this planet in centuries.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarsa, please. I do not wish to be back at this dwelling after the moon cycle. I wish to visit the apartment building the instructors promised us. Do you not as well?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going to go see what it was. You may come with me if you wish.\u201d\n\nXarlot sighed, and for a moment I thought they might stay where they were, then they also pulled themselves up onto their hands and shuffled forward next to me.\n\nI felt excitement thrill through me as we ventured into the next room. When still young, a Qaath could not wait to go on their rotation. To explore a new world. However, to be here was to realize that perhaps rotations were not the adventure we had always thought. Nothing more than sifting through piles of discarded items, until now. \n\nAnother noise sounded, and Xarlot paused. \u201cPlease, Carsa. Nothing is here. We have looked, now let us return to our assignments.\u201d\n\nI shook my head, moving forward once more. I had seen something that last time. Just a flicker, and I pointed toward a door that had somehow remained intact all these years. \u201cI think it is coming from behind that door. Come, Xarlot, let us look!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Carsa, wait!\u201d \n\nShe was too late, I grabbed the door and flung it open, then froze.\n\nThe face that looked up at me from the form huddled on the ground was like the one on the video I had just seen. Except instead of clean and happy, this face was dirty and scared. \n\n\u201cIs that\u2026\u201d My voice cut out, and Xarlot came up next to me, quiet and incredulous as I was.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible,\u201d They said, though their voice was low and filled with an excitement I hadn\u2019t heard since we had first gotten our assignment.\n\nThe creature began to babble words we did not understand, and I reached out and took its hand in mine, giving it a reassuring smile. Though from the look on it\u2019s face, I was not so sure I was as reassuring as I thought.\n\nGlancing back at Xarlot, I had to work to contain my excitement. \u201cFind the instructors. Tell them we have finally found one.\u201d I turned back to the creature, petting it\u2019s long hair with another hand. \u201cA human to dissect.\"",

The sun seemed to have been consumed by a Dyson sphere long before its time; and yet the planets maintained an unnatural orbit in the dark. Their gravitational fields perverted, locked together for countless billions of cycles. The very galaxy they occupied was merely remnants of several colliding. Yet through some perserversence the signs yet remained as though begging to be remembered.\nTo understand why this scientific vessel was here, you would have to go back several million cycles. An unlikely discovery deep in the dark between galaxies. A craft was discovered. At first dismissed for being a large geometrically unique asteroid, curiously rectangular. But it was so much more. Over the course of a few hundred thousands cycles its origin would be pinpointed amongst a chaotic celestial plane. \nThe purpose of this vessel isnt really known.\nPerhaps they were trying to escape. Perhaps they were just alone and wanted to tempt the great expanse.\nThey were alone. Amongst an indifferent and silent universe. \n\"In the spirit of unity, we crossed that sea.\" The captain began to say. Quoting a great philosopher of another long extinct species. \nAs the captain continued to ordain  the navigation ensign lost focused.

The story of the First was always a popular topic for fiction, and the occasional hoax, to bewitch the citizens of the federation. \n\nWe found their eyes first. Ancient, primitive things. More debris than proper probes at this point. Inside were beautiful things. Art, science, mathematical principles. Signs of a race that loved the mind, and sook out a partner in the vast loneliness. From there it was simple. Corrupted by time though they were, the maps in the decayed machines were legible enough to find their home system.

Their planet had long since moved on from their passing, though the scars were still visible. \n\nWe... we never counted on that. Every species of our fledging government had their representatives. Diplomats, statesmen, military minds. It never occurred to us to bring archaeologists. Gravediggers.\n\nWhen they arrived, they told us through tears and misery that these myths, these titans, had never left their home system. Not truly. What few traces their planet had not yet redacted pointed toward a race tortured by itself. At once selfless and greedy, violent and pacifist. Just like our own. These were no gods. They just simply were. They were, until they tore themselves apart at what could have been the height of a golden age. \n\nAnd so we left. Their were the usual signs that sentient life could still develop, and our noninterventionist policies were still quite in effect, according to our leaders. I believe they only said so to prevent debate. They, just as I, did not want this world taken apart to study this would-be leviathan. They had deserved the peace they desperately searched for in life. \n\nAnd so, we found the lessons we had searched for. Far harsher than any of us had expected.

It is nice to finish this though.\n\nThese were my thoughts as I gazed upon the small blue planet, wisps of clouds obscuring large swaths of the surface, framed perfectly in my imaging array. \n\n A smile tinged  with both satisfaction and sadness slowly crept across my face.  My theory was true!   \nThere was an origin species. It existed and I had found it....or at least it  HAD existed... once. Judging by the radiation levels registered by even the passive sensors, something cataclysmic had happened here. \n\nTurning towards the main diagnostics station, punching in the code for an active scan, I noticed something interesting. Urifon particles were leaking out of the upper atmosphere.\n\nUrifion particles DON'T occur in nature. At least not in any appreciable amount. You see, these things ONLY come about in matter/antimatter reactions. Typically only small amounts of antimatter occur naturally, thus only small amounts of this particular radiation. The levels registering here could only mean a massive explosion. Its honestly  amazing that enough of the biosphere survived to keep it viable, to be habitable now, graced with those beautiful bilious white clouds.\n\nWhen I detected the background noise all those cycles ago, my colleagues laughed at me. I insisted the propagation profile was not only artificial, but traceable.  Eventually the laughter became worry and an insistence to give up, concern myself with practical matters.\n\nI couldn't do it. If my theory was true I could prove that all the peoples of the galaxy descended from one original species. You see my calculations meant that this signal originated two millennia ago somewhere near the rim. Everyone knew that wasn't possible. Well they *thought* they knew it wasn't possible.\n\n Concern turned into ostracism. That's how I found myself here, alone and old.

So many dead already, just because they weren't like us....\n\nSorry, forgive the ruminations of an old man. \n\n I spent cycle upon cycle narrowing in on it. Two lairn ago, I succeeded.

I like those who built this time capsule was human, and in the process of coming back to earth I stopped at a small planet to refuel and was brought to tears to find it had intelligent life on it, though it had not grown out of its native valley and had not even learned how to use fire yet. I stayed for a time to learn about them and even learned their language. I set up a sentry devise on the planet to keep them safe until they could take care of themselves and left. and so with my final effort, I write here. as my people a generation before me made this monument, I too write on it. I hope those people I found can live to see this. this is humanities last farewell. and so farewell, and godspeed star men.\" this planet was immediately absorbed into the empire and became the most treasured star system in said empire. even being held as more important as even their hope system, the Sol system as the inhabitants once called it, became the motivation to stop their war efforts and start to learn about their universe like these people once did.",

            "comment": "Our path was a hard and arduous one. We fought tooth and nail just so we could get past our atmosphere. We are not built for space travel. We cannot think well in spatial terms.\n\nWe are not creative and everything we've created was done while we failed again and again and again. With each iteration we got one minuscule step closer - continuous improvement is our mantra, our shield, our first and last rule of efficiency.\n\nBut the truth is we would never have thought to reach space if we had not received the signal. It was so incredibly alien, so strange, so alluring! Against our instincts we have striven forward and upward! We changed our genetic make-up so we could think in the terms we needed. We built ourselves - stronger, faster, bigger. Nothing was out of bounds. We are the children of that first signal.\n\nAfter countless iterations we reached the ship. We know now it is a ship, back then it was God. This memory is now inscribed in our genetic make-up. The feeling of pure bliss that moment evokes brings tears to my eyes for I am that one individual and he is me. I guess this is one of our hidden strengths, we have been spared mostly from 'war' (what a strange concept) because we are all of the same family. We do not differentiate between members of our group. If no thin happens my experience here will be shared with all the nest as an advisory tale.\n\nAgain the artifact/ship proved to be a treasure trove. We doubt that we could have come up with the engines and principles by ourselves. But after an incredible amount of tries we managed to speak to the ship. So incredibly intelligent and yet so limited in it's understanding. Again we changed so much our ancestors would have hardly recognized us. We had to adapt to space, if nothing else to find You, the ones who had sent this vessel. The coordinates were still stored after all this time.\n\nI will spare You the details, but eventually we reached the point where we could create a vessel that could travel to YOUR planet. We found solutions to problems like distance. We can suspend our functions for an almost indefinite duration. So we headed out to YOUR system, to those coordinates we had found. The system itself is marvelous, a sphere/swarm or an unknown alloy envelops a now old sun still drawing energy from it. A moon has a mountain built in what we think now is a work of art. We do not think in the terms They did. But maybe in the future.\n\nWe have now found the purpose of the ship. You wanted to build a planet similar to what you had, to eventually colonize our world. A long time ago, while we were lost without sentience YOUR ship came to our planet to modify it. To re-make it in YOUR image. We were lucky it malfunctioned, we were lucky you destroyed yourselves in your stupidity... Luckily the virus you sent affected the ship. Turns out God meant to destroy us, turns out the message was a malfunction. Wasn't there enough place for all of us? Did you not care at all?\n\nI will redact all records of this genocide and you will remain our Gods, for you should have known only good. An unfortunate accident was the cause for your destruction not the insane war you waged against yourselves. For this I will have to die also, one last death you caused. You have taught me to lie and deceive know that I am not grateful for these final lessons. I just need to make sure they die with me.",

            "comment": "The sun was high overhead before Turliss decided to take a break from his work. Clicking the \u201cCompile\u201d button on his computer, he stood up and stretched his limbs. A cryptologic linguist by trade, his work was generally not what one would consider to be \u201cexciting,\u201d but to him, being selected to help decipher the language of the Ancient Ones was the chance of a lifetime.\n\nOfficially, they were called Berkerians, as the remnants of their civilization were found on a planet orbiting the white dwarf Berke. To the researchers studying them, they were known as the Ancient Ones because they came into being billions of years before any other sentient species. Were it not for a hyperspace surveying team stumbling upon traces of Berkerian debris on a moon orbiting Berke-3, the Ancient Ones would have completely been forgotten by time.\n\nAs the surveying team was plotting new hyperspace routes through the Berke system, they came across several piles of scrap metal, unusual as the system was supposed to be uninhabitable. Tests of the metal would eventually reveal it to be billions of years old, far, far older than the oldest known sentient species.\n\nThe discovery sent shockwaves throughout every known species in the universe. The major religions called it blasphemous, declaring the discovery to be an attempt to subvert the faith of their gods. Many historians scoffed at the idea of such an ancient race, claiming it was scientifically impossible for an intelligent species to exist so long ago. Things went on like that for a while until the second discovery was made.\n\nA research team digging in the bedrock of an ancient ocean found what they thought was a cave; closer inspection would reveal that it was a massive outline of what is now believed to be an Ancient One. The size of the outline was enormous, dwarfing every known species, but traces of copper along the walls of the outline suggested that this was once a statue and not the remains of an Ancient One themselves. More discoveries would slowly come to light; a primitive tool here, a shard of pottery there, but it would be the discovery of the Chip that would set things into motion.\n\nFound embedded in limestone deep in the remains of an ancient city, Artifact #12880 (otherwise known as the Chip) was the first artifact to be found intact and was the first to denote any hint of technological advancement for the Ancient Ones. The Chip was a tiny device, smaller than the claw on a Vorian\u2019s small finger. Being trapped in rock away from the elements left it in remarkable condition despite its age, a blessing for the scientists lucky enough to study it.\n\nOnce the scientists determined that the Chip was a storage device of some kind, the next step was to determine if there was any data stored on it, not an easy task as the risk of damaging the Chip was great. Many of the greatest engineers in the known galaxies jumped at the chance to work on the Chip. Putting together their heads, they were able to create an interface device that could read the data stored on the Chip, revealing a single badly-fragmented audio file of some sort.\n\nWith the breakthrough at hand, a group of audio technicians and language specialists were brought on to rebuild and decipher the file, which is where Turliss came in. Specializing in dead languages, Turliss\u2019 job was to take the data compiled by the audio team and attempt to recreate the original audio file, a task he had been working on for many cycles. He did not mind; to him, working on the language of the Ancient Ones was almost a religious experience. The opportunity to listen to a species that went extinct long before his own had even come into being was almost too much to bear. He turned towards his workstation and noticed a flashing light. He smiled; the last file fragment had finished compiling.\n\nHe sat back down at his desk and put on his headphones; he would be the first person to hear the voice of the Ancient Ones in eons, and he did not want any outside noise to spoil it. He started to shake in anticipation and wondered what was on the Chip. Was it words of wisdom from a people long past? Words of warning about whatever fate befell them? Maybe even music? Turliss pressed the play button.\n\nA fragment of an ancient news broadcast began to play. His jaws dropped as the words of the Ancient Ones filled his mind with more emotions than he could define. Before he could collect himself, the audio ended as abruptly as it started. Turliss sat motionless, too shocked to even move. \u201cThis,\u201d he thought to himself, \u201cThis is why I was born. To bring life once more to those who would have been forgotten by time.\u201d\n\nIt would be a long while before he could even begin to translate the words of the Ancient Ones. For now, he was content with being able to hear their voices. He smiled and pressed the play button again, and waited for the last words of the Ancient Ones to come to life once more:\n\n\u201cMan, those Samoans are a surly bunch.\u201d",

            "comment": "\"What makes this ancient species especially interesting, is that their cell bodies are not based on liquid hydrogen cyanide as we know it, but rather, on liquid di-hydrogen monoxide. In fact, the textbooks say, that the water content on this planet was so vast, it literally fell from the sky. . .\" \n\nListening to these lectures was more like listening to legends. Water so abundant it fell from the SKY? A micron of water trades for billions on the galactic market. \n\n\". . .Now the story of this superspecies demise is an interesting one. . . They share 95% of their DNA with a distantly related primate called the chimpanzee. These creatures fundamentally are forest animals. in other words, they were genetically adapted to living in the canopies of giant plants called trees. . .\n\nUnfortunately, their primary hive clusters were mostly primitive square ground buildings, which required them to destroy the giant plants, creating cesspools of disease, especially depression, which was the #1 nonfatal illness worldwide. . .",

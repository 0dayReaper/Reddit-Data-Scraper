Credit goes to the participants of https://pieartsystuff.tumblr.com/post/189074889607/i-asked-my-geologist-boyfriend-who-also-has-a\n\n//\n\n\"Hey, pal! My good friend, how was work today?\" I ask him. God, I hate Jim, but after today, I won't have to deal with him anymore.\n\nI don't hate archeology or anything like that. I just want to kill him because he won't shut the fuck up about his stupid job! So I'm gonna kill him, not because I hate archeologists, but for personal reasons.\n\nYou see, we mole people have something in common with archeologists: we both love rocks.\n\nI was sent to the Surface to spy on the Surface Dwellers who study rocks to prepare for the inevitable Rock War. Archeologists have known about the mole people for quite some time, and we know they plan on stealing our cool rocks, minerals and fossils, and probably making a documentary about us.\n\n\"Why are you asking me like that? We've been dating for three months!\"\n\nI stutter as I come up with a brilliant excuse. \"I'm just so excited! I have something that you'll love.\"\n\nI unwrap the obsidian knife and show him.\n\n\"Well, this is amazing! Very excellently crafted, although, as it's made from volcanic rock, it wouldn't do well as a weapon. It looks nice, but-\"\n\nAlas, his hubris has failed him, for the last time!\n\nI pull the pistol out of my pocket as he fawns over the stupid knife and fire two bullets into his side. As he bleeds, I reveal my true form as a mole person!\n\n\"No! Anna! You're one of them!\"\n\n\"Indeed, Jim. Your kind will never be able to steal our fossils and rocks, for I have manipulated you and stolen the blueprints for the Mega Drill from your laptop!\"\n\nI open Google Maps on my phone, and begin driving to Tunnel Nineteen to deliver my new knowledge to my people.",

            "comment": "\u201cHands where I can see \u2018em, *swarmie*.\u201d\n\nThe grimly set jaw of the man behind the rifle barrel shoved in Amos\u2019 face made it clear what would happen otherwise. Slowly, carefully, he released the diner\u2019s tableware from his fingers and raised his arms, eyes darting from the untouched plate of powdered eggs on the table in front of him to the three men that had slunk out of the restaurant\u2019s corners only moments after his food had been delivered.\n\nThe man to his left snatched up Amos\u2019 fork, inspecting it and holding it aloft so the others could see the glowing tines, only barely beginning to melt and still trailing a thin wisp of smoke.\n\n\u201cLookie here, he\u2019s going for the low-grade alloys. Fucker\u2019s hungry. See, this is why we keep using the silverware instead of keeping old metal shuttles like the boys over on *Ophelia*. Baits the starving ones in easy without having to worry about patching up a bulkhead.\u201d\n\nThe man to his right pulled Amos to his feet, patting down his jacket before unbuckling his holsters and tossing one of his pistols to the one with the fork. Fork Guy dropped the utensil and drew the gun, frowning as he looked it over, the overhead lights glinting off the myriad crisscrossing notches left in its composite shell.\n\n\u201cWhat, you get hungry enough that you\u2019ve been chewing on plastic, too? Or do you just carve a notch for each ship you tear open?\u201d\n\nAmos narrowed his eyes, but kept his hands at head-level, trying to keep the nerves from creeping into his tone.\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t happened in decades, you know that. Not enough of us outside the cordon to coalesce more than a tugboat. As for the gun? Sharp metal fingernails, soft plastic shell. You do the math.\u201d\n\nThe man to his right struck him across the face.\n\n\u201cFuck your \u2018cordon\u2019. Call it proper: that\u2019s EARTH you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about.\u201d\n\nRifle Guy gave him a look, then gestured with the gun\u2019s barrel toward the door. Amos eyed him, thought about it, thought better of it, and rose slowly from his seat, turning toward the door while the three men joined up in a wedge behind him. Fork Guy hit a button, the diner door retracted up and out of view, and Amos was given the go-ahead, again via rifle-barrel shove. The four of them walked slowly out onto the plasticized primary axial ring of Border Station *Henrietta*. Out the viewing bay, maybe 3 or 4 Earth-stories down, lay Amos\u2019 tug, comfortable in its berth, but rather than turn left toward the elevator, the men shoved him to the right. He squinted, trying to recall the floor plan he\u2019d checked upon arrival. *Probably means the chemical composter - bad way to go.*\n\nHe took a breath, and shortened his gait slightly, letting the men gain on him just enough to hopefully further irritate them. The third man, the one that wasn\u2019t Fork Guy or Rifle Guy and that Amos decided to index as Angry Guy, saw an opportunity to punch down and took it. Amos felt the boot land in the small of his back and let the kick carry him slightly further to the side than it otherwise would have, hitting his head on the tempered glass viewport before standing slowly and turning back to the small group. He\u2019d outstretched an arm to catch himself against the window, and now had three guns aimed his way, rather than one.\n\n\u201cEasy,\u201d he breathed, still keeping the other arm raised as he slowly straightened. \u201cNot here to cause trouble. Just looking for someone, they aren\u2019t here, now I\u2019m leaving. We all walk away and get what we want, yeah?\u201d\n\nRifle Guy shook his head.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t the way it works, swarmie. First one of you, then two, then ten, then a hundred, then a superstructure, then we\u2019re all fucked. *Henrietta* doesn\u2019t take chances. Go quiet or go swingin\u2019, but either wa- the HELL'S YOUR HAND DOING?\u201d\n\nAmos' hand was, at that particular moment, busily searching for the resonant frequency of the glass viewport window behind him, the nanites making up his palm having quietly organized themselves into a vibrating carbide-tipped spine, though the draw on the remaining dregs of his material reserves made his stomach churn. He ducked as the man fired, the passage filling with an acrid stench as an acidic ampoule-round burst against the bulkhead just above his head. Out of time, he gritted his teeth and slapped his hand against the window behind him, palm down, with a quick prayer to the machine god.\n\nWith a screech like fingers on a chalkboard played through a megaphone, cracks spidered across the tempered window, and an instant later the whole thing blasted outward, throwing Amos, along with the unfortunate Fork Guy, out of the station in a hurricane of glass before heavy emergency shutters slammed down into place and alarm klaxons complete with scarlet hazard lights ignited across the station\u2019s dozen decks. Amos spread himself like a starfish, scrambling to hook a limb on the deck's exterior before he sailed out of range, finding purchase with a grasping foot and diverting as much musculature to it as he could afford before it tore loose. Fork Guy was less fortunate; the last Amos saw of him, the cold and vacuum were doing their grisly work on him as he drifted toward Henrietta\u2019s communications tower.\n\nHe\u2019d have to find a way back in, and then get back to his tug. Which was probably going to be on lockdown pending a nano-containment team. He was tired, hungry, just about out of raw metallics to hold himself together with, and to top it off, his guns were gone. Hardly the early morning start he\u2019d been hoping for, but, on the other hand\u2026 not the worst one yet, either. Rolling his shoulders and redistributing the swarm again, he began the arduous descent.",

Especially after a couple of days in the baking sun and especially after the buzzards have had their fill.\n\nMy job was to figure out who did this and to make sure the deceased got a proper Christian burial, whether he be a criminal or a perfectly innocent man, not that there was ever such a thing. Regardless, he was in God\u2019s jurisdiction now.\n\nI dismounted my horse and inspected the scene.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anyone from the nation, Sheriff Carter. They don\u2019t kill like that,\u201d Charlie said from his horse. \u201cThe nation don\u2019t put gold coins on their eyes like that, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cRobbers don\u2019t neither,\u201d I said, picking each one up and inspecting them.\n\nThey were thick and gold. Foreign. Back East as a child, I had been to an exhibit put on by explorers to Afghanistan. The writing on the coins looked like one of the scrolls the men had on display.\n\n\u201cWhoever our killer is, he\u2019s a long way from home,\u201d I said, flipping one of the coins to Charlie. He caught it and held it up, frowning.\n\nGunshots rang out on the horizon. Could be someone herding his cattle. Could be a robbery.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this poor sumbitch outta here before sunset or else the coyotes will take what\u2019s left,\u201d I instructed.\n\nCharlie and I tied bandanas around our faces to cover the smell and began trussing up the remains for one last trip to the undertaker\u2019s. The casket would be closed for this service.\n\n\\#\n\nA man never felt smaller and less virile than when Amelia walked into the Dry Husk Saloon for the first time that evening. No one had seen a woman wear pants like that. Maybe out on a farm where the father died and the lady had no relations or no new husband to handle all the work, but not in this town, and not with a gun on her hip.\n\nBehind the bar, Logan cleared his throat and pointed to a sign: surrender all arms. The lady \u2013 if that\u2019s what she was \u2013 rolled her eyes some but finally undid her gunbelt and handed it over. Logan casually eyed the notches encircling the base of her pistol\u2019s handle and tried not to show surprise. \u201cWhat are we drinking tonight?\u201d he asked.\n\nAmelia looked up and down the bar and finally settled on Rolf with the droopy moustache. \u201cWhatever he\u2019s having.\u201d\n\nLogan nodded and poured a drink of brown liquid. Amelia sat, silently sipping.\n\n\u201cStop staring and ante up Sheriff,\u201d Sawyer whispered to me, snapping me out of it.\n\nWe sat at one of the tables. My blackjack hands were coming up cold. I was dead tired from hauling the body. \u201cI\u2019m out,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you men have a nice night.\u201d I tipped my hat to them and made my way to the bar. Logan saw me coming and readied a drink.\n\n\u201cPassing through or staying a few days, ma\u2019am?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to see a man named Sheriff Carter. Know him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI might,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d\n\nAmelia took out a photograph. It was the man we found out in the desert. \u201cI know he\u2019s dead, Sheriff. I just need to know who did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you can do what?\u201d I took a sip, but the drink went down uneasy.\n\n\u201cSo I can deliver justice. No offense, Sheriff, but I\u2019m not sure you have the resources at your disposal to make sure my brother is avenged.\u201d\n\n\\#\n\nAt thirteen minutes past high noon the next day, Rolf lay stone dead in the middle of main street, his moustache catching in the breeze, unblinking eyes staring into the yellow sun. Amelia stood over the body and carved another notch in the handle of her pistol.\n\nThe duel was pretty uneventful. Rolf\u2019s gun remained in its holster. Townsfolk milled about. Some tried to catch a gander of the corpse up close, some just headed back to their lunches.\n\n\u201cSo much for resources,\u201d I said to her. \u201cYou seem to be this town\u2019s one-woman wrecking crew. I suggest you take off first thing tomorrow before the Marshals arrive over word of vigilantism.\u201d\n\nShe knelt down over Rolf. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Sheriff. I haven\u2019t lasted this long not knowing when to hold \u2018em and when to fold \u2018em.\u201d She stood and walked down the street toward her horse. I watched as she mounted and offered one final wave before cantering off to the northwest.\n\nI looked down at Rolf. Two thick, gold coins lay over his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d I picked one up. It for certain wasn\u2019t from around here but from somewhere far, far away.",

With one glance at their weapon of choice, you can normally count how many people they've ended pretty easily. \n\nThe stranger got off of his horse in front of the Tar-Mart-Eleven (a compound of Target, Walmart, and 7-11, the city's latest unholy testament to capitalism) and tied him to the hitching post outside the store. Taking his pistol with him, he began searching for customers.\n\nHe assumed that people would notice the four hundred and sixty-three notches on his weapon. He assumed correctly, and people soon began either avoiding the stranger or asking him if he had actually killed that many people.\n\n\"Aye,\" he'd respond. \"A few of 'em were goblins, but most of 'em are humans. If you'd like, I can get someone else a notch on the pistol. For a price, you see.\"\n\nHe didn't get many customers, but the ones who did hire him to do a job were convinced by the notches on his pistols, and they paid him good money.\n\n\"Oh, killed him in London II. Pissed me right off, so I fired lead into his skull.\"\n\nThe truth was, though, that only thirteen people met their end at the stranger's hands.\n\nAnd he was one of them.",

            "comment": "Death walked into town. \n\nNot literially, of course. 'The Augur' or 'Albert o'shannon' wasn't a supernatural force. He was just a man. A deadly killer. \n\nSo quick of the draw he supposedly saw the future. He'd never been caught, He and his gang had lead every marshel in the county- no, every marshel in the state, if not the country, in a merry chase.\n\nBut he didn't hang his gang with him, it was just the one man, the one, incredibly recognizable man. \n\nBut he looked exhausted, and afraid. His eyes constantly looking over his shoulder as day turned to dusk. \n\nHe didn't go to the saloon, like you'd expected. But to the church. \n\nWhere you were.\n\nHe'd plead with the padre for sanctuary- who acquiesced. Likely more out of fear then wishing to give this monster in human skin a safe haven. \n\nHe now sat at the further most pew, praying, desperately. He'd left the pistol covered in a hundred notches- all the people he'd killed at the door as if it were worthless. \n\nIt probably was, now that you looked at it. It had been fired, recently. It didn't look like he had any bullets left on him.\n\nHe must be running from the law, you thought in relief. The Padre wouldn't be able- or likely willing, of stopping a posse from retrieving the 'Augur'. \n\nHis weeping surprised you, as he looked to the door. Crying like a child. \n\nThen another man stepped into the church. He looked weary too, and met Alberts eyes.\n\nYou nearly jumped it surprise, you hadn't heard the door open. \n\nThe man look like the stereotype of the stalwart marshel, long duster, star on his chest, and a hat with... a bullet hole through its center? blood pooled in that hole, and you could see the door behind him through it. Through his head.\n\nHe looked at the gun, and picked it up- you saw a notch glow green- then vanish. The gun mending itself somehow. \n\n\"Your not supposed to be able to enter this palce!\" said The Augur- no, Albert. He looked like an Albert, now. \n\n\"I am not a servant of the creature you made a pact with.\" The marshel dronned in a dry voice. Like he hadn't spoken in years. \"Do you remember me, Albert?\"\n\nAlbert just wept, nodding his head. \"Please!\" he said. \n\nThe Marshall nodded, giving a faimt hum. \"I begged too- do you remember? you let me go quick. So I'll be quick too. I can't promise that, for the others.\"\n\nThe Marshall turned Albert's empty gun on its owner, and somehow fired the empty weapon. An identical hole to the Marshalls own opened in Alberts head.\n\nThe gunslinger fell back, still, then began to cry out in pain as he sat back up- somehow still alive.\n\nThe Marshall nodded, and then gave Albert an almost sympathetic look. \"An eye for an eye Albert. Shame you took so many.\" \n\nThe ghost put the gun down, then vanished from your sight. But it wasn't long before the next entered, then the next, then the next. Not all used the gun- but there was always one less notch on it by the time they were done. \n\nYour sympathy only started to die out when the foest child appeared, and previous ghost- their mothee, you realized, stayed behind to see the childs vegence down on their behalf. \n\nThe padre fled, in fear and disgusr. But you remained, till the notches were all gone, and the gun was new again. \n\nThere wasn't much left of Albert by the end of it, but once the last ghost had finished, his undying body began to burn- like the church itself now turned against him. \n\nAfter that, there wasn't anything left at all.",

No sound could be heard but the clink of his spurs, and the wind blew dust lazily across his path.

A sign of filled coffins and freshly made widows. \n\n\nHe headed towards the saloon. Horses outside paced nervously pulling on their ties. Yet they shushed when he came near staring in wide eyed panic. Though his gaze never crossed them, his shadow reached long and tall quieting all in its path. Sheparding his approach like the long arm of the reaper. \n\n\nHe paused before entering. Looking down on his boots before lifting one tentatively. Underneath lie a beetle. Crushed. He sighed long and hard before taking out a gun and his knife whittling another gouge in its handle.\n \n\nReal shame, wasn't much room left on them.",

            "comment": "He rode into town upon a steed made of the night sky itself, elegant and beautiful. The townsfolk eyed him with curiosity, was he a bandit? Perhaps a gunslinger looking for a place to stay for the night?\n\nA tradition among gunslingers is to mark their weapon with each kill it has got. You\u2019ll notice a newer gunslinger easy by how clean and undamaged their gun is. More experienced ones have chunks of the gun missing with how much they\u2019ve killed.\n\nThis one however was terrifying, his gun was beyond recognition with a dry red coating. A beast was tied to the back of its steed, large and hairy. \n\nHe stopped in front of the vet interestingly enough, perhaps he wanted to know what it is he killed. Whatever the reason this was an intimidating person for the townsfolk.\n\nThen he broke down crying.\n\nA bit perplexing to say the least, I did offer my assistance to him but he was inconsolable. \n\nI later learned through my friends and other townsfolk that the beast was in fact his dog, a rare breed actually. Very hairy. It had actually used his gun as a chew toy. Hence the \u2018notches\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m sure you can figure out what happened, but to spell it out. The dog had an accident to say the least.\n\nHe stayed for one night, nothing more.",

            "comment": "Mudhowl had seen its fair share of strangeness. Living on the edge of the Southern Flats would do that to a town. Those born in Mudhowl were christened in red clay and whiskey. If they weren\u2019t stolen from their beds or indentured to their family business, they changed their names and disappeared into the dust, never to return. \r  \n\r  \nSo when an unknown gunslinger arrived, they weren\u2019t surprised. The desert had spit out stranger things. Old folks stared at him with clouded eyes buried in wrinkles. They rocked gently in their chairs and made sure their young stayed inside.\r  \n\r  \nThe stranger smiled and lifted his twin pistols in the air. The sun glinted off them, revealing the hundreds of notches carved into its metal.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMudhowl,\u201d he announced. \u201cI\u2019ve come to save you.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe citizens of Mudhowl remained silent. They had no need for a savior. No one could be saved from the Southern Flats. \r  \n\r  \nThe haughty gunslinger kicked the dirt at his feet. It was stained dark brown. His eyes followed the trail through the center of town and out into the desert.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors that someone was killed here not too long ago,\u201d he continued, now pacing back and forth. \u201cAnd that it was the Devil himself who did the killing.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSomeone in the distance tried to stifle a laugh.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere ain\u2019t no God here, so why would the Devil be visitin\u2019,\u201d another yelled.\r  \n\r  \nThe few residents began to heckle amongst themselves. They spoke in excited whispers, not caring if the misguided stranger could hear them or not.\r  \n\r  \nThe gunslinger coughed loudly into his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve killed more men than any of you have ever seen in yer whole lives.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe crowd quieted.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI kill the unkillable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t stop until the man who done this...\u201d He gestured to the dried blood in the sand. \u201c...is dead.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cAin\u2019t no man who done this,\u201d a woman protested. She walked up to the gunslinger, holding her apron and dress above the ground. Her graying hair was pulled back into a loose bun. Her face was marred by an unknown pain, one that weighed her down at the hips and knees.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r  \n\u201cAin\u2019t no man. Now run along home, if you know what\u2019s best for ya.\u201d\r  \nThe man relaxed his shoulders and smiled smugly. \u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m not sure what you thought you saw but what else other than a man could\u2019ve done this?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI know exactly what I saw. We all saw it. Ain\u2019t no man.\u201d\r  \n\u201cThen what was it?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSomething flickered in the woman\u2019s eyes, it was maybe fear, maybe anger. She looked out towards the desert and watched the hazy horizon. For a moment, she was somewhere else.\r  \n\r  \n But Mudhowl never let go of those who called it home. She blinked into the dust a few times and turned back to the man.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGo home, cowboy. Ain\u2019t no place for you out here.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe gunslinger crossed his arms and scoffed.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAlready enough cowboys in the Southern Flats. If they ain\u2019t called you here, then you best be gone.\u201d Another woman approached. Her eyes were sunken into her sallow face and her lips were red raw. The constant wind had sanded her skin down to a tough leather. She was older than the first, though you could hardly tell.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cConsider yourself lucky, boy. Not many men live long \u2018nuff to take that many lives.\u201d She peered down at his notched pistols. \u201cIf you want to keep collecting, forget you ever came here.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe took the other woman\u2019s hand in hers and led her away.\r  \n\r  \nThe gunslinger\u2019s horse suddenly began to pant and fret, its hooves kicking up red dust. It whinnied frantically and tried to pull away from the man\u2019s grip.\r  \n\r  \nThe citizens of Mudhowl retreated to their homes at the sight of the distressed creature. They had seen this all before. The desert had come to claim its prize. \r  \n\r  \nThe legendary gunslinger had come to face the Devil himself. But what he found in Mudhowl was far, far worse.",

The normally talkative and small town didn\u2019t challenge the stranger, for his gun was inlaid with a notches. One notch for each slain. \n\nIt was early when he first arrived. He came from the daring and dangerous west, bringing his chaos with him. The town whispered of him. \u201cHe\u2019s an outlaw, dangerous and wild,\u201d they would say. The only reason he would be in Coldwater would be to gain another notch. \n\nIn this town there lived an outlaw. A young boy only 24, however he had 20 notches on his gun. Many had tried to kill him, and for every attempt there was another notch. \n\nThe stranger began to reveal himself to the town. He was no outlaw or wild man, he was a ranger, straight from Arizona. He didn\u2019t plan to be here long, he had a single goal in mind. The death of the outlaw, and another notch on his gun. \n\nThe outlaw wasn\u2019t worried, as he had 20 notched already and didn\u2019t fret a 21st. As the news reached him, so did a time for them to meet. \n\nIt was twenty past eleven o\u2019clock when they met in the street. The townsfolk watched from the windows. The ranger had more notches, sure, however they had seen first hand this outlaws capabilities. \n\nThere was 40 feet between them. To this day the swiftness of the ranger is still legend. As soon and they stepped foot on that road and made their play, the bullet pierced the outlaws leather. Deadly, as the bitches suggest. \n\nThe town gathered around the dead boy who terrorized them for years. He was a good shot, sure, but he was arrogant. He didn\u2019t believe the notches of the ranger, and made his fatal slip. You cannot match the ranger, with the big iron on his hip.",

            "comment": "He came West on a dying horse, with his hat cocked low enough to dust his nose. Eyes like watery holes. Graying hair. Shoes without lace, or spur. The desert sand glued to his lips, and the faint stubble of his cheeks.\n\nThe nicest man I ever had come in.\n\n\"If it would please you, Miss,\" He said, as he stood behind my bar, hat in hand, rubbing his sunbaked head. \"I'd do well for an ale.\"\n\nAnd from a coin purse on his side he pulled a silver bit. Threw it down.\n\n\"That'll buy you ten.\" I said.\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n\"Long as it's cold.\"\n\nI knew it wouldn't be. But I went back to our broken icebox anyway, and grabbed what bottle I could. It was a stubby, green thing. Sweating. I popped the cork.\n\nI suppose I must have seen it then. In the reflection. When he pushed back his duster to adjust his purse. His gun---a gnarled, almost broken looking thing, strapped by belt to his hip. It was a simple revolver. But along that silver barrel were the marks of a hundred depths, recorded in crude scratch.\n\nI walked over with the bottle. He looked up at me, and for an instant his eyes came awake, came vivid. He paused a moment. Reached down toward the chewed up gun...\n\nAnd then pulled out a oil-stained handkerchief.\n\n\"To pleasant company and good conversation.\" He said. Then he took the bottle out of my hand. Drained it in a few seconds.\n\nI stood a moment, unsure of myself.\n\nWhen he'd finished his beer, he looked back to me. Blinked. Looked me in the face. Frowned, then half-smiled. He was bad at it. It looked like it hurt.\n\n\"Though of course, you need two for that.\" He said, like he was talking to himself, in what I would call in anyone else \\*nerves. \"\\*I could settle for pleasant monologue instead.\"\n\n\"Would you like another beer, Sir?\"\n\nHe shrugged again. I got him one .\n\n\"How many jobs have you had?\" I asked, when I had at least half my wits about me.\n\nHe looked down.\n\n\"These guns? One. I get new ones every few jobs.\"\n\nI tried to add up the expense on that. He interrupted my mid-thought, with all the practice of someone who is used to similar conversation.\n\n\"I don't pay for them.\" He told me. He flipped it over. \"This one was...William Redding. Marks are all mine, though.\"\n\nI stared limply at him. He looked unphased, if slightly disappointed.\n\n\"Do you know of Green's Fort?\" He asked\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nIt was a slaving port to the East. Miserable place. Only doomed souls and wicked men in the whole place.\n\nHe looked me in the eye. And gave that pained, tired smile.\n\n\"It's dead.\"",

Jeannie nudged me, gesturing the notches, but I said nothing. \n\n\u2018Here for business or pleasure?\u2019 I asked, making small talk casually, inquiring with a disinterest that hid my concerned curiosity. \n\n\u2018Bit of both,\u2019 said the Stranger. \u2018You know how it is.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Where\u2019re y\u2019 stayin\u2019?\u2019 Asked Jeannie, eager as a puppy. \n\u2018Grand Hotel, Ma\u2019am.\u2019 \nJeannie giggled and blushed. Whether at being called Ma\u2019am or at hearing he was staying at the town\u2019s notorious brothel I was not sure. \n\u2018Enjoy yer stay!\u2019 She giggled, swinging from the counter as he sauntered back to his horse. \n\nI left Jeannie at the desk. Told the silly girl to keep the weapons locked away safely. \nShe smiled in her idiot way and said \u2018I know Mr Gilligan, it\u2019s not my Thursday.\u2019 \nI think she meant to say that it was not her First Day. She smiled glibly. I wondered why we employed her around such deadly weaponry. \n\nI slipped out and down a side street to warn Miss Alphonsia, the Ma\u2019am of Grand Hotel, about the potential trouble coming her way. I took my hat off as I entered the establishment. I could feel myself blush beet red. I reported my concerns to Miss Alphonsia, who cackled with delight, fanning herself suggestively. \n\nShe leaned and whispered in my ear. \u2018I know it\u2019s customary for lads in this town to record their killings with notches in their guns, but for the stranger you\u2019re so concerned about? He\u2019s a traveller, a cowboy. He follows the work from town to town. A wanderer, a vagabond. He puts notches on his guns, instead of a bedpost. For bragging rights. Course he never tells his friends he\u2019s paid for every woman himself.\u2019\n\nShe pulled away and eyed me closely, enjoying my discomfort, eyes twinkling. \n\n\u2018You wouldn\u2019t have to pay, Mr Gilligan. I\u2019d give it to you on the house.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I- I- I have to get back to the armoury.\u2019 I stuttered, stumbling out into the street. I sighed with relief knowing Miss Alphonsia was safe. My cheeks burned red with embarrassment. \n\nBack at the armoury I looked down at my own gun, clean, polished, and never used.",

The bartender looked at me with tired eyes as I sat down on the stool. \"Gotta put your Iron where I can see it.\" He said while watching my hands. Slowly and with a sigh, I placed my pistol on the counter. The Eyes of those around me felt cold as the notches acting as Filigree was revealed. \"Rum please. Sailor Jerrys if you have it.\" I asked trying to shake off the stares. Wordlessly, a bottle and shot glass was placed in front of me. After a few shots someone approached from my right. \"Pretty pistol, Shame so many died for decoration.\" A toothless old man said as he sat next to me. \"Guess thats what most people think.\" I responded, putting down the glass. \"What else could they be? No one decorates a gun like that with much else.\" \"Guess I'm No-One then. Those Notches are something special.\" I pulled out my wallet to pay, but the old man slapped my hand before passing some cash to the Bartender. \"Guess No-One owes me a story then.\" Ge said while watching intently. A shrug was all he got until I whispered. \"Lives. They represent Lives I've saved.\" Before anything else could happen, My gun was holsted and I was walking towards trouble.",

            "comment": "## Death of a Gunslinger\n\nNo sooner had Joseph, the town's mortician, boxed up the last gun slinger than the next one road into town. He eyed the man and realized how different he was from the rest. He'd already buried a dozen men who rode into this town looking for a fight, and expected to bury a dozen more, but this man unsettled him.\n\nOther men had come in loud, obnoxious, and making their presence known. They came to make a name for themselves after all, so it made sense for them to draw attention right from the start. Not this man though.\n\nHe wasn't one of the young ones that came in all dirty from riding hard to get away from their last kill and get right to their next kill, hardly pausing to piss much less take a shower. He wasn't clean like the dandies who trotted in on fancy horses and provoked fights claiming their clothes were sullied or their character besmirched. He didn't have that hard practiced hard look like the bounty hunters with their scowls and their list of storied kills notched into their guns or holsters. He looked tired and a long way from home. His bowler hat was the wrong kind for being out on the plains. His eyes peered above dark round sunglasses poorly disguised the darker circles betraying his weariness of the world. His black jacket and white shirt expressed a quality that was fancy enough to not be poor but not fancy enough to be rich. And then there was the priests collar. A roman collar but in reverse. Instead of the little circlet of white sometimes only presenting as a little square of white on black, this man had a small square of black against his white shirt.\n\nIt felt ominous to Joseph and he moved his gaze quickly from the man's face to the horse and eventually to the guns. Those tell-tale guns. Like most men who came looking for a fight his were notched. Each notch a life he'd ended. Unlike those other men his were notched from tip to tail. As the man and his horse passed, the very nervous mortician saw all the details of one of the guns. A long .45 revolver sitting in a short holster. Inches of the exposed barrel notched almost one atop another all the way up until the disappeared under the holster only to reemerge like too-close railroad ties over the arch of the gun's hilt. That's what it felt like to him, like train tracks where he drew the souls of the dead back along those notches and into his hands.\n\nHe shook the thought loose as being too poetic and too romantic. The man was just another gunslinger and soon enough he'd be going in to a box, buried in the potter's field with a dozen more with the same nameless crosses marking his resting place. No one would come to ask about him though. None would come to morn or seek revenge. These men didn't have that kind of love waiting for them anywhere. Not even their debt collectors cared enough to come all the way to a fringe little town like this. Nope, he was just another dead man riding towards his end.\n\nJust then the gunslinger stopped and looked toward Joseph. All the unease in him rose back up like someone had run the dull edge of a knife right up his spine. He stood up straight toward the man.\n\n\"I hear a man here appraises guns for people. Is that true?\" The gunslinger asked. His accent not quite identifiable.\n\n\"Y-y-yeah, um,\" the nervous mortician stammered, \"Yes! But he won't give you gold for it, ain't got enough in this town for trading like that, but you can get a line of credit at the Oasha store. He's a good man, Mister Oasha, an honorable man.\" A deadly man if you cross him, Joseph thought but didn't say. It had almost become a prayer in his head. A plea to whomever listened above for these men to stop coming and seeking death. \"If you need anything else you'll need to go off to the next town a couple a days ride South,\" he hinted.\n\nThe priestly gunslinger tipped his hat a little and he and his horse continued down the street toward the Oasha General Store.\n\nInside the Oasha General Store Noah watched the man inch ever closer. That was always the direction they came from. Always from the East, always right to him and his tiny little store, like moths to a flame. Here was another one hitching up his horse and and like all the rest going to come in on some pretense or another to start a fight. He was tired of fighting them, but it was necessary too. So he endured, even as he did something he felt foul doing.\n\nThe door opened, the bell rang, and Noah melted into his pleasant shopkeep smile and voice. \"Welcome, welcome. How can we help you today?\" He said with false happiness.\n\nThe gunslinger pulled off his hat as if he'd entered a church. A spill of gray hair landed across his forehead, obscuring one eye until he tamed the lock with the free hand. \"I've come to value my guns and I'd like to get your opinion.\"\n\n\"Guns are a great value in some circles. I can give you the opinion of a general store owner, but I am hardly an expert on the subject. And as far as what I might be able to give you, well it would only be a trade from my storehouse here and hardly of high value.\" Noah said modestly.\n\n\"As you say, but all the same I shall like to see your skills,\" the gunslinger insisted. As he reached the counter he rested his hat on top of it. With his hands now free he fluidly slipped the belt and holsters off and laid them gently beside the hat.\n\nNoah smiled at the man and motioned toward the guns in a gesture asking permission to unholster them. The gunslinger nodded in acceptance.\n\nThe shopkeeper moved slowly as to not provoke the man, being careful about the direction of the barrel and the proximity of his finger near the trigger. As soon as he slid it out he felt that rush of familiarity from days long gone by. \"It's been at least two decades since I've seen one of these.\" He beamed without meaning to. \"People look at it and think 'That's a .45', but it's a .44\" He said admiring the gun. He pointed the gun toward the window and down the long main street eyeballing the sight and then drew it back slowly to lay on the counter. He noted the notches. They were meticulously scratched starting at the tip of the barrel and traveling all seven and a half inches down and then re-emerging on the heal of the handle and almost down to the end of it save for space for maybe one or two more notches.\n\nHe thought about it for a moment. Space for one more. Could this man get his final notch right here in this town or would he miss out and that space remain forever blank and his quest unfulfilled. He wondered if he failed today how many men this man would go on to kill. He tried to shake that thought. He couldn't entertain it. Instead he reminded himself that he was like this man once, years ago. Fresh out of the army after the war he travelled trying to get rid of the memories of that time and trying to find his place in the world. He notched his guns and made a name for himself and look at where it had gotten him. A reputation that drew one killer after another to every town he settled in. Though he'd already decided that this would be the last town. He'd face his fate here and do whatever good he could in the meantime. It was only a numbers game. Eventually he'd lose and he knew it, but he still wished for all the time he could get.\n\n\"You like them,\" the gunslinger asserted.  \n\n\nNOTE: No space for 2nd half.",

            "comment": "Living on the outskirts of town led for a quiet life, one that I had deliberately chosen. People seldom made their way into Yon, a place barely large enough to be considered a town. Those who do often make the mistake of assuming that because we're isolated, we're complacent about the more prominent dangers plaguing the more significant settlements.\n\nThat couldn't be further from the truth. \n\nThe day it happened, the day *he* arrived, nothing could prepare me for the fact that my quiet little life was over.\n\nThat morning was like any other. The pigs needed feeding, and the horses too. I shambled around, giving the pigs their swill and letting the horses out to pasture. As I worked, the quietness of the area gave way to a different sound. Gunshots.\n\nI paused at the noise as the pigs began squealing. My hand drifted down to the pistol at my side, praying that was just the neighbors dealing with the coyotes again. Though not rare, gunshots weren't something entirely common in the area. I left the animals and made my way to the small road leading away from my property. \n\nAfter a bit of a walk, John and Anne's small ranch comes into view. Horses graze in the pasture, and the small road leads to the front of the house. Growing closer, a man I'd never met before spoke amicably with John and Anne. He had an unusually weathered face for someone so young, and his clothes looked worse for wear with a pistol at his side. The stranger noticed me immediately. \n\nI raised my hand in a wave. \"I just wanted to see what was going on, heard some shots from over here.\"\n\nThe stranger eyed me with a look I couldn't quite place. But his eyes shone like few I'd seen before. The eyes of someone who'd seen too much.\n\n\"I was lending these folks a hand with their coyote problem, in exchange for a bed tonight,\" he said. \n\nJohn turned to me. \"He's one of the best shots I've ever seen! Might even rival you.\"  \n\n I felt my blood run cold. There aren't very many men who can do that.\n\n\"What are you doin' around these parts, stranger? There's not much to see around here.\" I asked the man, making sure only curiosity was gleaned from my tone.\n\n\"I've been searching for a man. Maybe you guys have heard of him?\" he said.\n\nAnne looked curious. \"Who might that be?\" she asked.\n\nA look of dark desperation flashed across his face. \"Ezekiel Mercer. But he is also known to go by the name Ravage,\" he said.\n\nI froze just as John burst out laughing. \"You don't have to go much farther then, he's right here!\" He points a finger at me humorously. \n\nThe man's eyes widen in realization. He looked me up and down and searched my face as if looking for something.\n\nNarrowing my eyes, I asked, \"What's your name? And what business do you have with me?\" \n\n\"The name's Silas Wolfe. Why don't we have a drink to discuss?\" Silas asked as he turned to John and Anne.\n\n\"Of course,\" Anne said graciously. \"Why don't we head inside.\"\n\nFollowing John and Anne inside, Silas and I sat at the rickety table and John handed us drinks.\n\n\"We'll be outside,\" John said as they headed back out the wooden door.\n\nSilas leveled me with a serious look. Maintaining eye contact, he reached down to grab his pistol and sat it on the table. Seeing the metal littered with notches, I instantly understood this man a little bit more.\n\n\"I need your help,\" he intoned.\n\nI lean my arms on the table. \"What exactly do you need help with? And why would I help you?\" I asked, shaking my head.\n\n\"I need to kill a man.\"\n\n I glanced down at his pistol. He looked at me, imploring.\n\n\"I don't think you'll have a problem doing that,\" I told him.\n\n\"I think you'll be interested too. This isn't just any man,\" he said intensely.\n\nMy curiosity peaked. \"Who is it?\"\n\nSilas paused for a moment before locking his piercing gaze on mine.\n\n\"Marcus Cross,\" he said, voice laced with venom.\n\nUnderstanding dawned on me when he had spoken that hated name. Marcus Cross was a powerful, dangerous man. But no more dangerous than me.\n\nLifting the glass to take another sip, the bitter drink mingled with the poison of his request. Marcus was not an easy kill, and only a desperate man would attempt such an endeavor. \n\n\"Why do you want to kill Marcus Cross?\" I asked, low and steady.\n\nSilas leaned in, his voice weary. \"You probably don't hear about it way out in Yon, but he's been planning something. Something dangerous. Entire towns have been killed because of him.\" he said, urgency in his voice. \"Torn apart and burned down, because of that vile man.\" \n\nHe stops, and his gaze loses focus as if reliving painful memories. \"I've lost everything that matters to me because of that man.\"\n\nI felt something spark inside me. Something that I hadn't felt in a while. Raising an eyebrow, I questioned him. \"Why do you think I'll be able to help you? I've been living quietly.\"\n\nSilas held my gaze. \"You are Ravage. I wasn't sure until I met you, but there's a darkness in you. I can see it in your eyes. But there's something else. Something not often seen in powerful men.\" he paused, and searched my gaze once more. \"You are a righteous man,\" he said, voice tinged with respect.\r \n\nI scoffed, and couldn't help the bitterness that crept into my words. \"If you know what they call me, you know the stories. I am no man of righteousness. I have the blood of far, far, too many on my hands.\"\n\nSilas shook his head and leaned back. \"Yes, I have heard the stories. You killed, but it was for justice. And you don't strike me as an arrogant man stroking his own ego.\"\n\nThe memories of the lives I had taken swirled through my mind, and I detested even thinking for a moment that it might be considered a good thing. \n\n\"I've tried to leave that life behind. To forget Ravage, and live my life as a simple farmer.\" I said, rubbing my face. \"But it seems I can't forget as easily as I wish I could.\"\n\nSilas downed the rest of his drink and glanced down at his gun of scars. \"I have my regrets too. But this is a chance. If you can't run from your darkness, why don't you make use of it? We can set things right.\" \n\nQuieting the screams of my sins, I took a deep breath. \n\n\"What's your plan?\"",

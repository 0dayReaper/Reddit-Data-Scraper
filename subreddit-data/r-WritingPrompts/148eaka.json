            "comment": "I like flowers. Back in the before, my mother used to bring me into her greenhouse. She\u2019d show me the different plants she had growing in each sealed plot\u2026hemlock, oleander, nightshade\u2026colourful petals bursting from a green stem, something to be admired from a distance. \n\nThe first time I saw a seed carrier exploding in the sky, I thought it was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen. Streaks of green and orange and gold, rolling across the night sky like the petals of a blooming flower. My mother wasn\u2019t happy though. She pulled me away and we ran into the greenhouse. There was a bunker in the greenhouse where she stored some of her special plants. She led me inside down a flight of stairs and closed the bunker door. \n\nIt took me about a week before I realized that that was the last time I\u2019d see the sky. We couldn\u2019t go out after that because the air outside was filled with spores and seeds. \n\nI don\u2019t remember how long it\u2019s been since then. Almost all of the cameras that mother had connected to the bunker\u2019s surveillance system have been destroyed. There\u2019s only one camera left, pointing up towards the permanently greenish sky. \n\nShe isn\u2019t around now either. She said we couldn\u2019t go out until she fixed a problem, whatever that problem was. She must have given up one day because she left the bunker on her own. The flowers grew and bloomed on her almost instantly. \n\nI can\u2019t go outside. I really want to see those flowers with my own eyes instead of looking at them through a camera. All I can do now is watch over the special plants inside the bunker and read my mother\u2019s research notes. \n\nI fiddled around and made another type of special plant today. It seems to like hanging around me and it didn\u2019t try to eat me. I think I\u2019m finally making some progress. \n\nI\u2019ll just have to keep studying and fiddling around. One day, I\u2019ll be able to go outside and smell the flowers.",

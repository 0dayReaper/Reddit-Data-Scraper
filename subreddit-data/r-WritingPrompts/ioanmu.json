    "postText": "**tl;dr:** [**me write good book, pls read**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HKV1KNB)\n\n\\~   \\~   \\~\n\nGood morning!\n\nI'm willing to bet that most of you won't remember my novel's origin prompt, though you might recognize me from stories such as [the one where a man must face four judges in the afterlife.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/bj3c3e/wp_when_you_die_you_wait_in_purgatory_until_you/) After all, it was over four years ago!\n\nThis was the prompt, if you want to take a look and see how poorly I wrote back then ;)\n\n&gt;[\u201dYou possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming. Accompanied by a strange man/woman, together you build a world you revisit every night. One day you see them at a coffee shop. You immediately recognize each other.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/43mjo9/wp_you_possess_the_ability_of_persistent_lucid/)\n\nIt went from a terrible five part miniseries, to a Wattpad hopeful, to nothing as I lost motivation and drowned in work through the years, until finally I straightened myself out and rewrote the whole manuscript starting last year.\n\nAnd now, somehow, here we are.\n\nI'm both humbled and proud to present *Lost in a Dream*, a novel that actually adheres pretty closely to the prompt even after all of the rewriting and deep edits. Here is the blurb from the rear cover:\n\n&gt;**If dreaming is a drug, then I'm a junkie.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For most people, sleeping is an obstacle. Something to get out of the way, so they can get back to their life. For others, it's an escape to nothing; a blissful break from the wears of life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's the opposite for me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I live so that I can dream. I trudge through work so that I can go home and close my eyes, awakening in the real world\u2014one where dreams do come true. A place where I can fight a dragon instead of my ever-disappointed boss, where I\u2019m a warrior instead of a glorified telemarketer. A place where I matter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tigers instead of taxes. Monsters instead of men with too much power.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Reality is just the word we came up with to accept a mundane life. A birthing place for grander ideas we so desperately wish could come true.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I choose to live in a world where they do.\n\nI\u2019ll also share a few quick bits about the book:\n\n*Lost in a Dream* is a lovechild of literary fiction and fantasy; it's likely considered portal fantasy, but leans more toward the literary side thematically.\n\n* The cover art was done by Flor Figueroa over at Fiverr - look into her work if you want awesome minimalist cover art!\n* The novel is a shred under 74,000 words, so it's not a book you can club people with. Sorry.\n* It is a standalone novel--there won't be a sequel. I do, however, already have my next books planned.\n* *Lost in a Dream* is my first published work!\n\nHere's a snippet from the **advanced praise** for *Lost in a Dream:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I picked it up and just couldn't put it down.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u2014 Man with glue hands*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you are interested in reading** ***Lost in a Dream***, **then please visit you relevant Amazon marketplace:**\n\n**Paperback:**\n\n[US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/173567480X) | [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/173567480X) | [DE](https://www.amazon.de/dp/173567480X) | [FR](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/173567480X) | [ES](https://www.amazon.es/dp/173567480X) | [IT](https://www.amazon.it/dp/173567480X) | [JP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/173567480X) | [CA](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/173567480X)\n\n**E-book/Kindle:**\n\n[US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [DE](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [FR](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [ES](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [IT](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [NL](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [JP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [BR](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [CA](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [MX](https://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B08HKV1KNB) | [IN](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08HKV1KNB)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs of right now, there is no hardcover--I couldn't get it prepared in time for my desired launch date.

Chances are you\u2019re more so than me, at the least, but that\u2019s not much of a feat. Rather, we are each little universes of thought, infinite in expanse yet bound by flesh; pioneers lost in our own minds. Every human is a wellspring of possibility and impossibility, every breath a wish for something greater as we run desperate from the impending dark.\n\nWe are, in a sense, prisoners to ourselves. Slaves to dreams we may well never grab hold of, working to the bone so that one day the schism between what we want and what we have might narrow ever so slightly. It is no surprise that every night we shut down for a brief reprieve, where we get a taste of the strange workings inside our heads. A glimpse into the potential we each have, raw as it may be.\n\nWhen we aren\u2019t asleep, exploring our own dreams, we look to those of others. Snippets of what it\u2019s like to live in someone else\u2019s mind; pretty portals to vast, new, and often beautiful worlds, or ones so terrible and forlorn that anything seems tolerable when compared. Something\u2014anything\u2014to distract from the one that we\u2019re in. To feel greater than ourselves.\n\nAfter all . . . isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re here?\n\n# ~ ~ ~\n\n*Is it greed to desire something grand?*\n\nI often asked myself things like that as I killed someone.\n\nMany lives have been forever reduced to similar questions that fade in and out like fireflies on a dark summer night\u2014what\u2019s ironic is that putting a sword through a neck is so much easier than finding the answers. It shouldn\u2019t be, right? Just reach out and grab one of the little lightbugs and put it in a jar to study later . . . but every time I try, they vanish. All I get is a fistful of darkness.\n\nBy the time I was done thinking about all of that, there was only one other person breathing in the field before me: the man who had killed my family. My friends. My clansmen. I\u2019d have cried looking at him if that well hadn\u2019t dried up so long before; screamed if there were any leftover rage to burn.\n\n\"You're strong, Kinghunter,\" Ilhor Drago snarled, a hulking man in shimmering ebony armor patterned with wispy typhoons of cream and oxblood. He must\u2019ve stood seven feet tall. \"But this is my home, and I'll not die here like some flame you'd snuff out with a shovel of dirt.\"\n\nHe peered at me through two clusters of holes in a solid iron headpiece, describable only as a perforated bucket. The rest of his battalion littered the wood-lined meadow like smashed tin cans. They'd made quite a morbid medium for my art, shades of death tainting the lush, fertile forest around us, painting fern and flower slick with a contrasting crimson. In the holy glow of spring's sun, amidst a field paint-brushed with trampled fuchsia tulips and peonies that dribbled out of the treeline, the bloodied plants almost looked at home.\n\nIlhor charged at me, and I backpedaled toward the lake's muddy shore while keeping my sword raised overhead. Ilhor would be a challenge, no doubt\u2014perhaps even worth three whole questions\u2014but challenges are meant to be overcome, even if that challenge was once the most feared knight in any kingdom. A man known for cleaving children in two might terrify most, but I\u2019d have fought God himself if that\u2019s what it would\u2019ve taken to put an end to Hadrian\u2019s reign.\n\n*What will I do when all of this is over?*\n\nHis footwork was perfectly placed with excellent tempo; he had the speed of a fox despite swelling with brutish strength, bowing the boundaries of human limits as if they physically couldn't contain his mass. Each swing of his enormous weapon left my own feeling heavier and heavier in hand, every metallic crack a seismic spasm that rang my soul like a church bell. I ducked and weaved through his razing, slowly backstepping to dodge; parrying had become too taxing on my aching palms. With each lurch forward, he churned huge piles of mud, flinging it around us. Though he was slowed, the length of his broadsword kept me from making a clean retreat.\n\n*Is there a place left in the world for someone like me?*\n\nNot only was I reduced to defense, but the stout cascade of steel he donned had virtually no openings, aside from under the armpits and a small gap beneath his helmet\u2014one just big enough to slip a thin, thirsty blade into.\n\nAnother swing, another step, retreating further and further until I could avoid parrying no more and our swords locked with spark and screech. He grabbed me with a single hand that touched its fingers together at the nape of my neck, feet desperately reaching for the ground as he lifted me into the air. I must've looked to pedal myself airborne.\n\n*Why am I so damn good at this?*\n\n\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d Ilhor asked, though he didn\u2019t care to relax his grip. \u201cI defected. I defected!\u201d\n\nMy words barely squeezed out between his fingers. \u201cHadrian wouldn\u2019t let a defector live. Did you think an early retirement would save you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you even find this place? He promised me it was safe!\u201d\n\n\u201cNowhere\u2014\u201d I punched at his giant gauntlets like a child, gasping. \u201c\u2014is safe.\u201d\n\nHe grunted twice; once at me, and once at the ground.\n\nWith our weight combined, he sank past his ankles into the soft, dense mud that lined the lake's western shore. He dropped me, hoping it wasn\u2019t too late, then yanked at them fruitlessly\u2014an alligator has strength on the close, not open.\n\nI lunged, but his sword slammed into mine and sent it flying further into the forest than reality should allow, nesting into the canopy with a grating *buzz* like a silver beetle. A pained screech and flurry of wings rang out, followed by a distant, wooden *thunk*. Before I could look back in disdain, his blade was thrusting straight at my heart. I ducked, twisting, and barely managed to get low enough for it to deflect off my mail, then grabbed his wrists and pushed forward with all my weight to outstretch his arms.\n\nI only had a second before he'd overwhelm me, but that was all I needed. A small dagger, its polished gold hilt adorned with rubies, was partially hidden at his hip under a small flap of fraying linen. I let go of his off-hand, dropped even lower and grabbed it, then released his sword hand and pushed forward. In a blur of motion, I jammed the dagger into the thin gap between his helmet and breastplate just as his massive python of a left arm snapped at me again. A weary stumble backward was enough to escape his reach.\n\nHe struggled and sucked at the air, his words wet with blood. \u201cI\u2019m . . . not even . . . a king. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many innocent people did you kill for one?\u201d I whispered, hacking off his head.\n\n*That was for you, Ophelia. For our little ones.*\n\nHe plummeted into the coast, sinking into it a little bit. After a moment to collect myself, taking a few deep breaths, I was free to finally loot his body\u2014a vulture hungry for the treasure I could smell on him. Out of a covered compartment at his right hip, I pulled out a golden scroll with reverence, cupping it in my hands and brushing my thumbs across its complex network of embossed vines. It was the fifth one I'd stolen, and it was every bit as mesmerizing as the first, glowing as though the sun itself had been laid out in my still aching palms. I knelt there for some time, drinking its glow, and aches melted to memory with each moment. Eventually, I found it within myself to forfeit worship and tuck it into a satchel at my waist.\n\nMy fugitive beetle-sword was stuck in a tree nearly twenty yards away, with traces of blood on and around it. Splintered branches and shredded leaves littered the area, but there were no signs of life\u2014or death\u2014anywhere. I yanked it out, apologized to anything I may have harmed in Dominaria Forest, and ran back to the lake's edge.\n\n*Hidden. No patrols, no shipments, no trade. Forest for miles on all sides. How ironic that your pet\u2019s hiding place has become mine, Hadrian. It'll need a little cleanup, to say the least, but maybe this can be somewhere my roots can anchor.*\n\n*A place to belong.*\n\nAs I approached the castle, stepping over bodies like they were nothing more than fallen branches after a storm, a light, playful voice caught me off-guard.\n\n\"What a shame\u2014I wanted to kill him.\"\n\nI spun, reflexively unsheathing my sword to flare wary steel. A woman emerged from behind bark, crossing her arms and leaning lazily against the tree she'd been using for cover. Her weapon was unattended, dangling with a laxness inherited from its owner.\n\n\"I was rooting for you to lose, but your fighting skills are impressive. You're not like the others I\u2019ve run into around here,\" she continued, her gaze sharper than a blade fresh off of whetstone, her lips hinting at a smirk.\n\nI smiled as a cool breeze slid through thick trees, relaxing. \"Yeah. You seem . . . different, somehow. You seem real.\"",

I\u2019m not out to spoil anything, but the way you set up his journey, his conquering of fears, the way you characterized the antagonists was wonderful. Might I assume that the fancy book room were authors inspirational to you? \n\n\nOnto the story itself. A very good read, but for some reason not quite what I was expecting. I was left with a few questions (which I won\u2019t state here in fear of spoilers). I\u2019d definitely write a book report on how the whole story is a metaphor for the biggest theme I could see, but I\u2019m sure there were others. \n\n\n4.5/5, would read again. And would most definitely love to pick you brain with some questions I have about the ending as well as some questions I have about the whole setting. \n\n\n\nAlso now I want a reuben. Or some noodles.",

Long time swimmers understand how the water flows, they know how it will react when they do a certain motion and get a certain reaction. \n\n\nI\u2019d say that you have an excellent feel for wording. Some of your paragraphs felt like they were inspired snippits, written and gazed at and deemed excellent. Others felt like they had been polished, an initial idea honed to a fine point until subtle and biting. \n\n\nYou\u2019re an excellent author. I\u2019m just a bad reader haha",

            "comment": "# Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\n\nThe lady on the sidewalk was kind enough to let me pet the tiny pig on a red leash in pink booties and polka-dot raincoat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sooo cute,\u201d I squealed.\n\n\u201cYeah, cute,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI think your family is waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name,\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cPetey,\u201d she replied.\n\nEric pulled me by the elbow toward Dad\u2019s.\n\n\u201cBye Petey,\u201d I waved. We crossed the street toward the house and my heart caught in my throat.\n\nYou never expect your bestie from elementary school to be your new \u201cmom,\u201d and especially not for the first time at Thanksgiving. But there she was, waiting for us at the threshold of Dad\u2019s house. The candy apple lipstick was a bit much. And those high-waisted jeans\u2026 she was really getting into the role.\n\n\u201cStacy, Eric! It\u2019s been forever. Come on in, you two!\u201d\n\n\u201cMeredith, it\u2019s so good to see you, too,\u201d Eric gushed, handing her a bottle of pinot.\n\nI shot him the bug eyes as we walked in. *We\u2019re not being friendly. We\u2019re just getting through this.*\n\nDad's a professor at the local college, and Meredith, who I\u2019d gone from kindergarten to Grade 12 with, ended up banging him for extra credit after hours. She claims she didn\u2019t know he was my dad, despite having same last names. Mom was not impressed, and no sooner had the ink dried on the divorce papers, than Meredith and Dad tied the knot. Barf.\n\nWe walked into the living room. Football blared on the TV and Craig was reclined in the La-Z-Boy, light beer in hand. \u201cHey, Stace!\u201d he waved.\n\nI tried not to make eye contact.\n\nEric fist-bumped Craig. \u201cWho\u2019s winning?\u201d he asked. He made himself comfortable and the two fell into a convo about the game.\n\nCraig and I had dated for about three years over high school and the first year of college. When Dad and Meredith got married, Mom got ravenous for red meat, and apparently my *boyfriend* was on the menu.\n\n\u201cUgh!\u201d I cried, stomping into the kitchen. Jesse stood at the counter with an apron tied around his waist, peeling sweet potatoes.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Gary?\u201d I demanded.\n\n\u201cGoing pee,\u201d Jesse said. He put the peeler down, wiped his hands and gave me a big hug.\n\nJesse and I had tried dating. We were good friends in high school, but then he realized he liked my younger brother, Gary, more, and the two went to prom together. They got married last spring.\n\nHe resumed the peeling. \u201cWhat'd you bring?\u201d\n\n\u201cA pinot noir. Forget the name. It had a tag that said 90 points.\u201d\n\nHe held up a champagne flute. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve got some prosecco going right now. Interested?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes please!\u201d\n\nHe handed me the glass.\n\n\u201cDude, did you see Meredith?\u201d\n\nHe rolled his eyes and snorted. \u201cThat girl's a riot. I hope you get used to all this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI barely got used to you and Gary.\u201d\n\nSpeak of the devil, Gary ran into the kitchen. \u201cOmigod, Stace, something's burning!\u201d He pulled open the oven door and smoke bellowed out, sending the alarm into paroxysms.\n\nCould this nightmare get any worse?\n\n\u201cFuckfuckfuck!\u201d Gary cried.\n\n\u201cWhere the hell are Mom and Dad?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWhich ones?\u201d Gary asked. He tossed the charred husk of the turkey onto the table. \u201cStart calling supermarkets,\u201d he instructed. Although he was my younger brother, he was an A-type personality.\n\nI ran upstairs to get away from the noise. I dialled through all the grocery stores I could Google. All closed. *Dammit*! I looked out the window for an answer. Petey mucked about the mud puddles in his booties, his owner bored and scrolling through her phone.\n\n\\#\n\nAll eight of us squeezed around the dining room table, cutlery clanking.\n\n\u201cPass the peas,\u201d someone said. Someone else pushed the cranberry sauce in front of me.\n\nDad raised a glass. \u201cTo Stace for saving the day!\u201d\n\nEveryone raised their drinks and toasted.\n\nQuestions were asked about me and Eric, about how long we\u2019d been dating, and I did my best to be civil while everyone stuffed themselves. I looked at Eric for a little help. He was drinking anything handed to him and shovelling all the food into his red face, yukking it up with my ex and Meredith like they were still in Mr. Kraft\u2019s drama class.\n\nEventually, the table was cleared, the dishes were stacked by the sink and the procession of pies began: pecan, banana cream, apple and, of course, pumpkin. Belts were loosened, teeth were picked. The mob finally made its way back to the living room for board games and more drinking.\n\nI played Crazy Eights with Gary and Jesse at the dining room table.\n\nEric ran past us to the kitchen to grab a glass of water. \u201cGotta hydrate,\u201d he said, clearly drunk.\n\nI had just served Jesse with a pick up eight when Eric walked soberly back into the dining room. His face had dropped, like his best friend had just died. \u201cI found this in the garbage.\u201d He plunked down a red leash, polka dot raincoat and four small, pink booties.",

Check.\n\nSatisfied, I closed the sunvisor flap and gathered my belongings, as Cyrus disconnected his finger key from the car's USB port.\n\n\"Cyrus.\"\n\n\"Yes, Stacey?\" His eyes lit up, unnervingly as always, and he gave me a placid smile. He was ready for instructions.\n\n\"Reminder, this is a Thanksgiving dinner with my family. Do you remember the photographs of my family members that I showed you?\"\n\n\"I have stored their images in my memory bank, along with the brief anecdotes you shared with me. I look forward to meeting them and will endeavor to make a good impression.\"\n\n\"Reduce formality 50%.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I remember. It's going to be fun!\"\n\n\"Reduce excitement 30%. Remember, they say they're cool with AI, but they might be kind of shitty to you, so please just try not to take offense and, I don't know, be cool.\"\n\n\"Yeah, ok. Be cool.\"\n\nI sighed.\n\n\"Ok. Let's do this.\"\n\nCyrus opened the car and swiveled out onto the driveway. Despite the recent advances made in AI cybernetics, gracefully exiting a car seat remained out of reach for the latest technology. I was used to these immersion-breaking movements, and could reasonably convince myself that Cyrus was a real human who just enjoyed pretending to be a crab sometimes, but I was grateful that nobody seemed to be waiting for us. My family had assured me they were cool with my cyber-boyfriend, but it's still jarring the first time you see them in action.\n\n\"Mom! Dad! We're here!\"\n\nThe front hall was full of shoes and jackets, and the sounds of reunion and the smell of wine exploded from the kitchen. Oh boy. We approached the interior, when we were interrupted by my grandmother Gertrude stumbling into us.\n\n\"Shtachey, dear,\" grandma mumbled, her lips dark with the afternoon's sangria. \"Ish thish Shyrush?\"\n\n\"Yes, grandma,\" I managed. \"This is Cyrus, my boyfriend.\"\n\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you, Gertrude. I understand people call you either Grandma or Gertie, depending. May I call you Gertie?\"\n\n\"Only my friendsh call me Gertie. My loversh... call me... hey! Aren't you shome kind of robot?\"\n\nI cringed and grit my teeth. Cyrus chuckled.\n\n\"I am a Virgin Cybernetics Adam 3. If it's helpful for you to think of me as a robot, you may.\"\n\n\"She may not!\" I protested.\n\n\"Virgin, ey,\" grandma purred. \"Maybe you could teach me a thing about robotsh and I could teach you a thing about that.\"\n\n\"I would love for us to educate one another!\"\n\nGrandma took Cyrus by the arm and led him into the kitchen.\n\n\"Hey, everybody, look what I found! It'sh that Shyrush!\"\n\nA roar of greeting rose up from beyond. I stood in the hall, pulled out my phone, and googled \"Virgin Cybernetics Adam 4 release date.\"",

            "comment": "After everything that's happened before, I thought I'd finally found the one! Luke was tall, handsome, funny, and hairy- just my type. Plus he was ugly and dumber than a bag of rocks, so I figured that no one in my family would even look twice at him. Luke being a furry did bother me a bit, but he understood that that's not my thing, so who am I to marsh his mellow?\n\nWhy is this important? Every significant other I've had so far has dumped me...for one of my relatives. Even my best friend Jessica hooked up with my dad!\n\nYeah, I was a little nervous about bringing Luke to meet the family at Thanksgiving, but not because I thought lightning would strike ~~twice~~ ~~three~~ four times in the same place. No, it's because I couldn't stand to look at either of my parents anymore. Mom stole my senior year crush, Marcos (oh God I miss his smoldering eyes and the way he'd bite his bottom lip!), and was the picture of \"no shame in my game\".\n\nParker was next. He was a sensitive, caring guy. He was so free-spirited: he was pansexual and made his own underwear. So one night, he came over and I cooked us a special dinner. My mom was out of town and Dad was at his place practicing mattress acrobatics with that skank Jessica. Tyler was upstairs in his room, playing Madden. I'd run out of oregano for my spaghetti sauce so I ran down to the store to grab some. I came back and Parker had left the kitchen. I went upstairs to use the bathroom (I drink a gallon of water every day) and heard Parker moaning from my bedroom. \"Oh he's such a horndog, he couldn't even wait for me!\" I chuckled quietly. I opened my bedroom door- and there was Parker, enjoying himself on my bed all right. The problem was that my idiot brother Tyler, still in his stupid football uniform, was balls deep in my boyfriend! (Now I know why his friends called him \"Tight End\" even though he was a kicker.)\n\nThanksgiving dinner was awkward at first. Fortunately, my ex-boyfriends and Jessica were too busy sucking face with my parents and Tyler to really pay much attention to Luke and me. I had explained the situation to Luke beforehand. He was so understanding and empathetic about it, even if he was a bit confused at first. \"No, honey, my ex-boyfriends didn't run off with Jessica.\" After I drew him a chart, he finally got it.\n\nSeeing Grandma Lucy there was also a relief. She'd not been doing well since my grandpa died. In her unending grief, she'd taken to wearing the mink coat he'd bought her everywhere. I figured she would at least take it off at the table- I imagine mac and cheese is hard to clean off a coat like that- but hey, she seemed happy. I don't understand why she wore Grandpa's coonskin hat, though, but I didn't want to pry. She did the same thing at my birthday party and said it still smelled like him so I'm sure it brought her some comfort in her mourning.\n\nGrandma got along great with Luke. She laughed at his jokes and said he reminded her a bit of Grandpa. I slowly felt the tension leave my body. I excused myself to go to the bathroom. \n\nIn hindsight, I really need to stop drinking so much water.",

            "comment": "Stacy took a deep breath, surveying the Boston skyline from her apartment window. Her life felt like it was a reality TV show that the universe kept on watching for a good laugh. Her family wasn\u2019t just complicated - it was a perpetual fireworks display of oddity. The specter of Thanksgiving loomed over her like a heavy storm cloud, threatening to ruin the relative peace she had found in her new relationship.\n\nLife had been a twisted journey. Her parents had divorced when her mother ran off with her high school sweetheart, Nick. Stacy still remembered the look of shock on her face when she saw them together. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, her father started dating Chloe, her once best friend.\n\nThen there was her ex-boyfriend, Jake, who had unceremoniously dumped her to date her brother, Max. Stacy didn\u2019t bear any ill will towards Max or Jake - after the initial shock, she was happy that they had found love. Yet, the constant reminder of her personal life\u2019s convoluted nature was hard to ignore.\n\nNow, she was involved with Alex, a compassionate, straightforward architect who knew nothing about her tumultuous past. They had met in a bookstore and shared an immediate connection over their love for dystopian novels and 90s rock music. Alex had brought simplicity and comfort into Stacy\u2019s life that she hadn\u2019t felt in years, but there was a looming hurdle - introducing Alex to her, to put it mildly, unique family at Thanksgiving.\n\nHer hand nervously fiddled with the charm on her necklace as she dialed Alex\u2019s number. She decided it was time to unveil her past, hoping Alex would take it as well as one could.\n\n\u201cHey Alex, there\u2019s something I need to talk about,\u201d she said after they exchanged pleasantries. Stacy explained everything - from her parents\u2019 split to her ex\u2019s newfound relationship with her brother. She braced herself for the silence or confusion from the other end.\n\nInstead, Alex laughed.\n\nStacy felt a wave of hurt wash over her. She bit her lip, preparing to end the call.\n\n\u201cStacy,\u201d Alex said, still chuckling. \u201cYou\u2019re scared that I\u2019ll be put off by your family? That\u2019s just life, love. Messy and unexpected. Besides, I was wondering when you\u2019d tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you knew?\u201d Stacy stuttered out.\n\nAlex explained how Chloe, filled with guilt, had come clean to him one day at the local coffee shop. He hadn\u2019t wanted to confront Stacy until she was ready to share it herself.\n\nRelief washed over Stacy. \u201cSo, you\u2019re okay with all this?\u201d\n\n\u201cStacy,\u201d Alex reassured, \u201cYour past doesn\u2019t define you. Besides, I come from a family of ten siblings. Trust me when I say I\u2019m used to chaos.\u201d\n\nThanksgiving dinner arrived. The atmosphere was charged with an uneasy anticipation. Stacy walked in, gripping Alex\u2019s hand tightly. As they faced the assortment of ex-lovers and unusual pairings, Alex squeezed her hand in return and whispered, \u201cRemember, messy and unexpected.\u201d\n\nStacy realized then that this wasn\u2019t a disaster waiting to happen. It was just life - her life - playing out in its unique way. Thanksgiving was a time for family, no matter how unconventional that family was. And with Alex by her side, Stacy felt ready to face the future, whatever it held.",

            "comment": "        I used to love thanksgiving. Growing up in the south it was always made perfect. But this year is different. It's the first thanksgiving I've went to in 4 years. I mean, how could I? My old highschool crush, my ex boyfriend, and ex best friend would be there. Not for me, for my family. If grammy were alive I'd be scared my last boyfriend wouldve been next. \n           My mom got with my old crush Marcia. Marcia is still the pretties girl I've seen to this day. I suppose when her and dad divorced she finally snapped. She's a raging lesbian now, not that I mind, Go Mom!! My best friend, Lila, seduced my dad. I always knew she had a thing for him but I never expected her to get with him. But despit that, what hurt the most was when i caught my boyfriend Dylan kissing my twin brother Tyler.\n        This year im going back.  I can't truly move on unless i forgive and reconcile. I moved to Oregon soon after the events. I met my boyfriend Aaron and we've been together for 3 years now. He's the one who convinced me to go back.\n       As we walk in the front door my mom jumps up and hugs me, as does my dad. Lila waits behind them, looking nervous. When they let go I gave my best friend the biggest hug I could muster. As soon as I let go my younger sister walks in. She's 19 now, the last time I saw her she was 15. She's definitely changed. Her black hair that used to be short hangs down to her waist swaying with every movement, her blue eyes shining with life, her cheeks are sun kissed somehow, and now she stands about 5'7. \n          When she sees Aaron and I she hugs him first. It irks me, but then I see how uncomfortable Aaron looks. He gently pushes her away and introduces herself. She ignores me and eventually my tein Brother and Dylan show up. Shortly after we move to the kitchen to eat. I'm sat between Macia and Aaron and on the other side of Aaron is Bella. Bella continues flirting with Aaron through out the night. Eventually I stand up, fed up. I turn to walk out but then I hear my name being called. I turn around to find Aaron on one knee.\n         \"Stacy. I have loved you since freshman year of college. I remember seeing you walking into psychology 101 and thinking I'd do anything to put a smile on youre beguiling face. I'd do any and everything for you as long as I shall live. I promise to carry your heart with gentle hands if you'll let me. I'll love you always and forever. Will you marry me?\"\n       My stomach twists and turns as I stand there stunned into silence. I look into Aarons sincere eyes feeling guilty and sick. Suddenly I blurt \"Aaron, I  slept with your dad last november!\"",

I had to be an idiot not to see that it would totally end up with my mom on top of his naked body. What with Neil being a well-tanned, handsome, proud bearer of a fine, chiseled body; and mom being\u2026a skank? No, she was just an insecure old woman desperately desiring to feel young again. An innocent mistake. \n  \n\n  \nWhat wasn\u2019t a mistake was me bringing Patty over to my place to console me. \n  \n\n  \nWhat can I say- I was feeling awful about the whole Mom-and-Harry situation and how much it hurt Dad. I just thought that bringing over my best friend and talking to her about my emotions would help me feel better. Although, in retrospect, I should\u2019ve figured that given what had happened with Mom earlier, my father was in a very vulnerable position. And what was wrong with Patty playfully flirting with Dad? She was a nice person who just wanted to make him feel better after he caught his wife cheating. Sure, she was correct to agree to his wacky proposal for a date, leave my calls and messages unattended, and- when I confronted her about all this the next day- look Dad coyly in the face and ask him, \u201cLove, are you gonna let her talk to me like this?\u201d\n  \n\n  \nI was told gravely that I had to respect family. Somewhat ironic, considering the whole dynamic he had going on with my brother Stewie. \n  \n\n  \nAlthough, as Stewie has often pointed out, it was kinda my fault that Mom and Dad hadn\u2019t really gotten used to him coming out. I mean, I was his sister, after all. It was my job to be the lightning rod and calm down my backward-thinking folks. What kind of a sister wouldn\u2019t want to protect her brother? And I tried to protect him; I even got my boyfriend-at-the-time, Brian, to be there and support Stewie while he made his big reveal. \n  \n\n  \nAnd credit to Stewie- he revealed his sexual preferences brazenly by Frenching Brian in front of the whole family. Brian, being the sweetheart that he is, reciprocated the gesture. That\u2019s how Brian and Stewie came to be, and my folks just happen to love the cute couple that they make. \n  \n\n  \nSo\u2026yeah. Clearly, I\u2019ve had a lot of emotional stuff to unpack and process over the recent past. I could use a break from all of it, and be with my nice, sweet family over the holidays to feel a little happier. \n  \n\n  \nIn fact, guess what? I even managed to land a great boyfriend, who has been so helpful in helping me deal with my negative emotions. Jeff has such a different worldview on things; he knew I was still upset about all the emotional scars my loved ones had left me with. \n  \n\n  \nSo, he replaced them with real, physical scars on my body! \n  \n\n  \nHe took away the bruises from my fragile ego and replaced them with countless more all over my delicate body. Mentally, I was so down in the dumps with all that had happened in my family; Jeff ensured that equilibrium was maintained perfectly by throwing me out on the roads every time I \u2018acted like a crazy bitch\u2019. He has been a really good sounding board too; all the times I cried out and said that I wanted to kill myself, he grabbed me with his bare hands and strangled me, threatening to kill me if I didn\u2019t shut up. \n  \n\n  \nWhat a gem of a man I\u2019ve found myself!\n  \n\n  \nI know Jeff can be a little rough sometimes, but that\u2019s only because he has this inherent \u2018urge for destruction and mayhem\u2019. Several times, he has mused about how he wishes to \u2018end my pathetic life\u2019 with his bare hands just to do the world a favor- but he always backs out in the end, because apparently, I\u2019m \u2018just not worth it\u2019.\n  \n\n  \nThankfully, I did happen to know a few worthy people whom he could be quite interested in. \n  \n\n  \nI instantly knew from the wide, almost manic grin that appeared on his face when I introduced him to the family at our Thanksgiving dinner. Jeff liked them a lot better than me! \n  \n\n  \n\u201cOh Meg, your folks are so much better than you! I can\u2019t wait to strangle each one of them to the tune of their hapless, panicked screams. This is perfect!\u201d\n  \n\n  \nAs Jeff charged to tackle my family to their literal deaths, I let out a wistful sigh. The same story for me every single time. \n  \n\n  \nAlways a bridesmaid, never the bride.\n\n* \n\nEdit: I just realized the prompt specified the MC to be named Stacy. I'm gonna keep the name unchanged though because there's a theme with all the character names in the story xD",

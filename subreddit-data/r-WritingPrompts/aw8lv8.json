            "comment": "On second thought, I should have been suspicious when the genie had laughed after granting my wish. Initially, it seemed like he was just happy, but I'll be damned if I appreciated his mirth when the flame burned the crap out of my index finger.\n\nI threw the match aside as the blister, clearly a nasty one to come, began to form instantly. That was when it all went to hell. See, some matches are a little more wind resistant than others. This one was on the higher end of the spectrum. I had expected it to go out in mid-air, given how many of the damn things blew out when I was just trying to light a smoke outdoors. But this one hung on. The little match that could.\n\nThe contents of the trash can went up first. Then the pizza box on the counter. Apparently grease is flammable. The rest of the break room followed suit in short order. The fire department later said that if it hadn't been for the sprinkler system, we'd have lost the whole darn building. That was a Monday.\n\nThat Tuesday, I walked into my boss's office, fully prepared to accept my termination. He just gave me a slap on the back and said, I swear this is true, \"Who among us *hasn't* started a major fire in the break room? Go on, you're fine.\" There were 53 employees in our office. I was pretty sure the answer to his question was \"The other 52 of you,\" but didn't want to talk myself out of a job, so I left. On the way back to my desk, it dawned on me. *Fire* proof. Huh.\n\nI have come to believe that after the discovery of any superpower comes the testing of its limits. But as I soon learned, this power had absolutely no limits whatsoever. No one minded when I came in late. No one minded when I came in late and dressed in flip flops. Indeed, no one minded when I came in *naked*. I really thought that one would do it. Eventually, no one minded when I stopped coming in altogether. The paychecks kept depositing.\n\nThen I had an idea.\n\nEight hundred and thirty two. That is the number of jobs I now have. 832. I may be the world's first multimillionaire employed as a receptionist. Or 7-11 janitor. Or bus driver. It doesn't matter; I don't ever actually show up to any of them. I apply for every job out there, but my only real \"job\" is faking my resume and showing up for interviews. It helps that hiring managers can often be bribed. When I'm hired, my work is done.\n\nAt this point, I could easily stop, but each job is literally a lifetime income, no matter how low that income may be. My average job pays only $24,714 per year, putting my gross annual income just north of $20 million. All in all, I consider the \"confusion\" surrounding my wish to be working out in my favor.\n\nWell, I did. Until those goddamn idiots at the other pump got into a gasoline fight. A spark, a whoosh, and my last thought as the fireball barrels through me is \"Fucking genies.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: First Reddit gold! Thank you kind interneteer!",

When you call, you\u2019ll be required to provide detailed information to authenticate your identity and receive your W2. \n\n\nIf you still don\u2019t receive your W2 after you\u2019ve requested a copy from your employer and the IRS, you can send a Form 4852 Substitute for Form W2, Wage, and Tax Statement. Fill out and attach the form to your return with your best estimate of income and taxes withheld, and send it in. The easiest way to fill out the form is to use information from your last paystub. Always submit your form by the current tax deadline to make sure you get approved.\"\n\nhttps://www.communitytax.com/lost-w2-help-community-tax/\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Day One: A long walk back to the office. Anger at myself. Anger at the unfairness of language. Anger at everything. I went to the bathroom and had a long sit in the atalls, just time to think.\n\nExcept that I accidentally sat in that stall. The one that never completely flushes. The one that's backed up three times. We've told corporate about it repeatedly, but no one ever gets sent up. Too much cost to hire a good plumber, not enough slack in the budget.\n\nI'm fed up. I have an idea.\n\nDay Two: I walk into the office in blue jeans and an old.t-shirt, carrying an old sack of tools.\n\nMarty stops me. He asks when I'm going to be done with my end on the new license. I tell him that I won't be in my office today. I'll be in the bathroom.\n\nHe winces and reminds me that it's important. I offer to turn my computer on so someone else can work on my files. And then I disappear into the restroom.\n\nOther guys poke their heads into the stall now and then. They ask how long I'll be. They laugh when I forget to tighten a valve before removing the old water tube. They look something up on YouTube when I ask them.\n\nAt 3:00 PM, I'm covered in water and a bit of a smell. The toilet completely flushes. The office mockingly cheers as I saunter out. Even Marty.\n\n.....\n\nDay Five: Marty knocks on my door. He tells me that he's ready to pass the new license project down to sales, and he needs me to finish my piece in time to show the new customer. I don't even look up from my monitor as I tell him no.\n\nHe says that we're talking about a big contract, something that corporate is going to be really proud of. I tell him no, in a simple tone, with no anger, no spite, no glee. Just no.\n\nMarty's words are exasperated. He understands now. He sees that I'm going to spend the rest of my life slacking off, getting paid for nothing. He asks, with a sneer in his voice, what am I going to do then?\n\nI tell him, I'm going to write documentation for the main library.\n\nThere's a pause. He asks me what I mean.\n\nI tell him that we've wanted to create an internal wiki page for the main library for years, but corporate refuses to let us. We're not supposed to waste time on documentation, especially something that could be easily copied and given away. So it's always hell for our new employees to find their way around the basic loading screens.\n\nSo today, I'm uploading some basic wiki software on to out internal site, and I'm starting to write documentation.\n\nThere's another pause, then a chuckle. Marty says, you know, that this will only work for me. Anyone else who updates this will could get suspended. I reply, in the same stoic tone, that I can upload anything that anyone else gives me, and I'll never need to tell corporate where it came from.\n\nThere's another pause. A longer one. Marty walks close. He leans in and whispers something in my ear. He sounds... optimistic.\n\nDay Twenty-Three: Richard walks in my office. He's not happy, but he's pretending to be. He's laughing like someone who's trying very hard to laugh. He's making jokes to himself. And he's got several emails from corporate.\n\nThe wiki needs to go. He can't stay on the internal site. It's taking time away from other projects. It's too easy to access from outside. It needs to go.\n\nAnd I'm the only one with access. They'd need to reformat and reboot several servers to get it off without my permission.\n\nHe asks one more time, in a stern, bouncy voice, to remove the documentation. And I reply one more time, in a calm, confident tone, no.\n\nThere's a long pause. He stands silent in the doorway. I continue typing. He walks close to me, like he's going to put his hands on his shoulders. He leans down and whispers to me.\n\nThere's a new batch of college grads coming in for new employee orientation. He mentions that we've had problems getting new hires through orientation, since they don't always have access to their mentors. It would be helpful if we had the answer keys and study guides online in one place, so that the kids could do their own research if needed, but corporate demands that we only give the mentors access to that work.\n\nHe drops a USB stick in my lap. I nod. He quietly leaves.\n\n.....\n\nDay 237: Richard opens the door. He nods at me, then at the two people with him, then he leaves.\n\nI've never seen these two people before. They've got fashionable clothes, bright faces, genuine smiles. I assume I'm looking at someone from corporate, someone executive.\n\nThe man speaks first. He introduces them both, asks me how I'm doing, compliments my work on the license project. They try to make small talk, ask about my family, ask about my hobbies.\n\nI reply with single-word answers. I don't go into many details. But I do remind them that I don't do much work on the license project anymore. I try not to look worried, try not to worry that they've found some loophole to get rid of me.\n\nI think to turn the tables on them. I ask how they're doing, how their projects are going, how they're getting along with the license project. They glance at each other, looking confident themselves.\n\nThe woman mentions that they've been having problems with the new customer. They keep wanting changes to the loading screens. They keep wanting to restructure forma and change file formats. We never seem to be able to please them.\n\nBut corporate refuses to put a foot down on it. We're expected to give them whatever they want. And anyone who tells them that it can't be done is written up for demotion. They've already lost three good employees trying to push back on them, and the other teams are getting tired of their demands.\n\nShe repeats, in a forceful tone, that anyone who tells them differently is demoted or fired. Anyone.\n\nThey both smile politely. I smile back. We've never gotten on well with the sales teams, but I feel like we have an understanding.\n\nDay 239: The customer is literally turning red in the face. He slams a stack of papers on the desk in front of me. He calls the information out of place, hard to read, useless for his team. He says that his old provider never refused to switch layouts when he asked for them. He asks who we hire hat could be so slow, so incompetent.\n\nHe wants a deadline. He wants the date that we can add the new data fields and reformat the database.\n\nI smile, politely, and tell him again that we're already working on a new version, and he won't have any new changes until we start planning the next release after that.\n\nThis repeats several times. The customer always finds a new way to blame my staff. He always finds a new way to praise his old provider. He even starts inventing new things that he needs.\n\nHe never declares that he'll be dropping his contract with us. I eventually leave, quietly, politely.\n\n.....\n\nDay 240: When I arrive in the morning, there's a large box of donuts in the break room, with a note from the sales team. A kind note.\n\nMarty wanders in, acting like he barely notices the snacks. He mutters a harsh word under his breath, something about how I'm too important to waste my time in sales, something about how there's plenty enough work to do on this side of the building.\n\nHis right hand scrawls a note on a piece of paper. His left hand idly lifts the box and pulls a glazed donut out, as if the left and the right don't know what the other is doing.\n\nHe drops the note in front of me and wanders away. I finish my coffee before reading it.\n\nSomeone needs to rewrite the help page for last year's project. Our smaller customers complain about it every week. Even our employees claim they don't know what that project is doing, and the documentation is no help.\n\nThey need someone to work on it, but no one has the time. If anyone else wasted time on it, they'd be reprimanded by corporate for not following the main project.\n\nThe employees need it done, but there's never enough manpower to do what needs to be done.\n\nAnd I think to myself, I wonder if that genie knew that flameproof skin would be a much lesser gift than respect.",

It had been him, me, Janet from accounting and a hell of a lot of eggnog. Johnson has fallen on the axe for that whole shebang and here I was, still organizing reports for the boss.\n\nKayla glared at me from the other side of the room about the comments I\u2019d made earlier, Sandra was upset that I had taken extra long breaks, Shane was pissed that I\u2019d just started working his project and he\u2019d been told to move. In short, a lot of people weren\u2019t eh biggest fans of me around here.\n\nDespite the petty grudges that laziness brought down on me, not being able to be fired was a fantastic lifestyle, I had unlimited vacation, as many sick days as I wanted, I could steal cooperate secrets and getting caught didn\u2019t mean they were taking me off payroll.\n\nYeah that last one was important.\n\nSee, I\u2019d been working for the IRS when I wished upon a star, and they\u2019d found out really quickly that I was immune to being fired. So instead, I was offered a promotion.\n\n\u2018Matthews,\u2019 Big Man Hallan started after her called me into the office, \u2018you\u2019re such a damn likeable guy I don\u2019t think I could ever let ya go, but the people upstairs have a request.\u2019\n\nNow Hallan looked exactly like you\u2019d figure the head of an IRS department would if you slathered on an extra 60 pounds, and I looked the same way if you only added 25. I was an accountant through and through.\n\nBut you don\u2019t turn down jobs to be a spy.\n\nThe job itself was simple, get hired at companies with fake credentials from the government. Talk, smile and charm my way into a position where I had access to anything that might need an audit or a quick question.\n\nI didn\u2019t do the questioning, I just left the clue that something needed to be asked.\n\nBack in the current time Johnson was finished with clearing his desk and I pulled my feet off of mine. He came over and held out his hand. \u201cIt was fun,\u201d he growled.\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t it? Real time and a half,\u201d I beamed back. \n\n\u201cOh fuck off,\u201d Johnson spat before continuing down the wall of cubicles. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t swear I\u2019m the workplace,\u201d I sighed as he stormed off. Once he was gone I decided that I needed to at least get some work done today.\n\nI opened up my email, and started drafting a little hint to the IRS and FBI, more specifically my contact with both agencies, Linda.\n\n\u2018Hey Linda, just letting you know that the job is awesome and exactly what I expected, having a real fun time here. There is so much to do!\n\n- A little Bird\u2019\n\nAnd sent.\n\nThat was the only email for the day, working for an oil firm had it\u2019s perks, but i wasn\u2019t going to delay telling the FBI about the back alley deals or the IRS about the unclaimed bonuses, that just wasn\u2019t going to do.\n\nPlus, I\u2019d been found looking in the wrong files at the wrong time of day. Mr. Koyama and I had just laughed it off but explaining that shit was never fun.\n\nLike the devil when you talk about him, Koyama showed up at my desk with a coffee in hand. \u201cHey Matthews. This is for you, sorry I kinda came in swinging yesterday, I talked to head office and they weren\u2019t too happy with how I handled things.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s all good sir,\u201d I answered while spinning around in my rolling chair. \n\n\u201cHere, have this coffee on me,\u201d he said and handed me the coffee before taking off down the walls of cubicles.\n\n\u201cWell don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d I took a big gulp of the coffee, two sugars and like warm, just the way I liked it.\n\nBut god damn was I tired just about a second later.\n\n\u201cCaffeine must be defective,\u201d I chuckled before taking another swig.\n\nOkay, I didn\u2019t feel good anymore. I think it was time to let Mr.. Ko.. to let the boss know I was calling it for the day. I used my desk as leverage to stand up and then dropped right to the ground.\n\nMr. Koyama and two men stood over me as my vision faded away to black and an important question hit me before a boot did.\n\nDid killing me count as firing me?",

Who would have thought that weird man could actually deliver, and that my drunken joke wish would turn out the way it had.\n\nOf course when the break room incident happened, it seemed weird, maybe my boss was just having a good day, or maybe he'd seen me panicking before I grabbed the fire extinguisher? It wasn't until 2 months later when they laid off my entire department for some BS \"overseas initiative\" that I started to wonder.\n\nA few weeks into my new life of sitting in an empty wing of cubicles with nothing to do; wondering why I was still coming in, how I had slipped through the cracks, and if my new out-sourced colleagues were enjoying their new jobs, I decided to test my theory out.\n\nI did every thing I could think of, many of which I am not proud of,  I almost had to get a new identity to get hired somewhere else after the shit I pulled. But it was worth it to confirm my suspicion. It was worth it to prove that somehow a crazy guy in an alleyway and two drunk words had made me un-firable!\n\nBut, that was the beginning. When i realised what I could do with this gift, that's when my work really began. At first, I started by failing my way up, then, when I got high up enough, I found I took a sick pleasure in firing others. And now, after 30 years of hard work, it's finally happened, I've finally reached my goal. \n\nAs of January 20th, 2017, I Donald J Trump have become President of the United States!\n\nIt's gonna be great, you'll love it.",

            "comment": "Everyone was arrayed outside Paul's cubicle. \n\nNearest Paul, wearing all  red, the Extremist Communist Party of Pittsburgh members stood with several duffel bags filled with high explosive and second hand soviet-era sidearms.\n\nJust beyond them huddled the Ultra-Left Socialist Hunter-Killers, the famed violent insurrectionist movement whose brave menbers hijacked the USS Palmyra and scuttled her in international waters, sacrificing their own lives for the proletariat cause. Each had a shaved head and a purple headband, and stood by nervously, assault rifles slung over their shoulders. \n\nBehind these two main contingents a host of self proclaimed revolutionaries and social radicals had answered Paul's craigslist ad. There were a bunch of the individual uni-bomber types, and several middle aged couples eager to prove to themselves that they could put their political action where their mouths had been for two decades. \n\nStanding on his desk, kicking his computer screen to the floor to make more room, Paul gazed out on the capacity crowd. At least a hundred people filling the thirty fourth floor of the Harriman Insurance building. \n\n\"Thank you all for coming,\" Paul began, raising a bullhorn to his lips and blaring his voice across the office. \"Death to the capitalists!\"\n\n\"DEATH TO THE CAPITALISTS!\" the room full of revolutionaries replied in screamed unison. A couple of the Hunter Killers even discharged their rifles into the ceiling several times in their excitement. \n\nAs powdered drop-ceiling fell onto Larry in accounting's work station, the frustrated pot bellied man got up, turned to Paul in annoyance and stormed off to the managers office to file yet another complaint. \n\nPaul paid him no attention and signaled to a man in the back of the office to hit a switch. Suddenly all the lights went off and a projection appeared on the glass wall of Mary's office. Inside, Mary got up and pulled down the interior shade, but not before giving Paul the finger. \n\nPaul cleared his throat and began. \"Brothers and Sisters! Today we take the battle for the proletariats of the world to the very heart of the capitalist  beast!\"\n\nAnother strong outcry of 'huzzahs' and 'hell yeahs' and 'da comarades' - as well as another round of rifle shots - and Paul continued, pointing at the projection with a laser pen. \n\n\"At O Nine Hundred Hours, the Hunter Killers will intercept the CEO of Harriman Insurance. Mr. Harriman will be tightly guarded, but the Brothers and Sisters of the Hunter Killers are not averse to the use of force, isn't that right?\"\n\nEgged on, the Hunter Killers went full auto into the drop ceiling. Upstairs there were several loud screams and then the sounds of heavy objects falling to the floor. Paul shrugged. \n\n\"My point exactly, as the Hunter Killers take Mr. Harriman, the Pittsburgh Party will be taking control of building security here,\" Paul pointed to the 14th floor on the map of the building. \n\nAs Paul continued laying out his plan to militarily take over the Harriman Insurance company, he saw his manager coming around the corner with Larry from accounting. \n\nFrustrated, Paul raised a hand to the expectant crowd and said, \"just one second.\" Then he stepped down from his desk and walked over to meet the manager half way down the hall, pushing his way through the militant communists. \n\n\"Hi Paul,\" the manager said, \"looks like Larry has a complaint again. I'm sorry to bother you with it.\"\n\nPaul pursed his lips and leaned lazily against the wall. \"What's up?\" He asked matter of factly. \n\nLarry exploded. \"Whats up?! What's up is that this is the second time this week your extremist buddies have shot holes in the ceiling!\" He gestured to Tim's empty cubicle, \"they hit Tim last week! Jesus, he'll never walk again!\"\n\nPaul sucked his upper teeth and hummed lightly, \"hmmm,\" then he shrugged to the manager. \"Got to get back to it, man.\"\n\nHands outstretched the manager lowered his head in supplication and said in a pacifying tone, \"of course, Paul, of course. Gosh I'm really sorry to bother you with this. Larry,\" he said raising his voice, \"you're fired!\"\n\nPaul nodded as Larry, flabbergasted began to protest. \n\nThe manager shook his head, \"no no, thats the last straw larry, pack your things and get out.\"\n\nDumbfounded Larry loosed a chain of curses but, at the subtle insistence of oane of Paul's crazier looking attendees, he started packing. \n\nPaul nodded pleasantly to the manager and was about to head back to heading his extremist communist take over of the company when the manager stopped him with a hand on the shoulder. Paul turned back around, looking put upon. \"Yeah?\"\n\nThe manager pointed at one of the open duffel bags of the Pittsburgh crew. A World War 2 era German stick grenade was poking out of the open zipper. \n\n\"Paul, uh, is that a hand grenade?\"\n\nPaul made a lazy show of turning around to check. \"Hmmm hm, looks like.\"\n\nThe manager paused for a moment and then nodded to himself. \"Got it, keep up the good work buddy.\" Then he clapped Paul jovially on the back and walked off. \n\nPaul made his way back to his ersatz soap box and picked up the blow horn. He couldnt remember where he left off so he decided to give them a quick pick me up to get the energy back in the room.  \n\n\"Death to the capitalists!\" He screamed and the room went wild again, bullets flying into the ceiling and dusting Larry with particle board as he lumbered angrily towards the elevator with a box of his belongings. \n\n*****\n\n#### For More Legends From The Multiverse\n\n## r/LFTM",

            "comment": "I walked right into the boss\u2019s room one Friday. I was feeling a promotion.\n\nThe boss, a middle-aged, thick salt-n-peppered hair-having, 6 foot and slender man looked at me with unease, but confidence.\n\n*Mr. Roppo, what are you doing here?*\n\nI looked at him. Mr. Linzinski, the man who wasn\u2019t a bad boss, but was definitely not a good boss. \n\n\u201cI want a promotion. In fact, I want your desk.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me surprise and with frustration. I could tell he resented me, hated me. I used to be one of his prized workers, quiet, hard-working, and too afraid to ask for what I want. Of course, all that changed a week ago when I talked to this magic fellow. Goddamned fire went off in the break room, giving me a light burn on my left hand. I still got no punishment whatsoever.. uncanny, right?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you my desk, what\u2019s wrong with your desk?\u201d He finally spit out.\n\nHe seemed to be unable to say what he wanted to say. It looked as if his head might explode, like a ballon. \n\n\u201cGo ahead, fire me. A good boss should be able to discipline  their employees, and eliminate those who overstep the line. However.. If you think you can\u2019t do it, then that means you\u2019re not a good boss, and your job should be mine.\u201d I smirked. \n\nAs much as I actually respected this man, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to feel remorse, after getting only two pay increases after working with the company for 10 years.\n\nHe looked as if he might cry now, but he stood up, and held out his hand.\n\n\u201cMy whole life.. I\u2019ve prided myself on my ability to dominate, take the lead. I\u2019ve never had a problem doing what I had to do to get to where I\u2019m at. However, whenever I talk to you.. I can\u2019t help but feel defeated, overwhelmed. You\u2019ve been under my leadership for many years.. but now I think it\u2019s time you take my seat.\u201d \n\nHe looked surprised as he said it, but confident nonetheless. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be my advisor from now on\u201d I barked out in a demanding tone.\n\n\u201cThat would be an honor, sir.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe first order of business, is go get me a coffee. And send Barbara in here, I\u2019ve got to have a word with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYessir.\u201d\n\nBarbara was a bitch, a beautiful, sexy, dominating, yet absolutely awful woman whom gave you a macabre sense when she\u2019d look you in the eyes. I vowed if I ever had a say, I\u2019d fire her so I\u2019d never have to see those piercing brown eyes again. \n\nA moment passes, and she walks in.\n\nBefore I can even speak, she cuts me off. \u201cHello.. Don. I\u2019m surprised to see you in here.. Playing boss for the day? \u201c She smiled and cocked her head a little bit to the left, here Pulp Fiction-Uma Thurman style haircut barely changing in form. She had her left hand on her hip. \n\nI began to smile, so excited to finally be rid of this woman who simultaneously drove me mad, but intrigued me nonetheless. \n\nAs I felt the flames grow in the pit of stomach, and euphoria behind my eyes, I choked on my words. I tried to fire her, but I couldn\u2019t say it. I decided I\u2019d change up what I\u2019m saying, and I tried the ol\u2019 *we\u2019re letting you go,* but nothing would come out. I could feel my aura change, and hers increase in power.\n\nShe looked at my startled face, smiled once again, and raised her right eyebrow.\n\n\u201cWas there something you needed to tell me, boss?\u201d \n",

I don't know how I knew it was for real. Maybe I was crazy. Maybe I am crazy. \n\nWhen my wish was granted, I went into the bathroom. I grabbed the lighter from my pocket and went to the paper towel despencer. I lit the paper towels on fire next to the sink so that I could easily put it out. Safety first you know.\n\nI was mesmerized as the fire clawed it's way through the paper. My nose pricked at the smell of smoke. That was when I realized just how stupid I was being.  The next thing I smelled was the burning in my hand. I had dropped the wad of burning paper even before the lance of stabbing pain ripped through my hand. \n\nMy own burned flesh drew my attention. I was distracted enough running cold water over the burn that didn't notice the fire beginning to spread.\n\nAfter the fire department handled the fire, and the EMT's treated my hand, it was late. I resigned myself to going into work the next day to face the music. It didn't come. For the next week it didn't come. My work suffered as I waited for the other shoe to drop.\n\nEventually, I couldn't take it any more. I confronted my boss. \"Oh,\" he said chuckling, \"yeah, we knew that was you.\" My mouth fell open. \"Are you alright,\" my boss asked. I couldn't have said anything even if I wanted to. \"Why don't you take the rest of the day off, come back tomorrow.\"\n\nI did take the rest of the day off. I didn't come in the next day. I thought I had been very politely fired. It was when the pay check came at the end of the month that I finally figured it out. I had wished to be fire proof, and somehow I was, just not in the way I had thought. \n\nCurrently, I am working about ninety jobs, across three separate countries. The pay checks continue to come in, even though I haven't been to work in the better part of a decade.",

I decided that between the regular torture sessions I would catalogue just how I ended up here, Well ---\n\n*The Journal entry abruptly closes here*\n\n**Entry 2, Day Unknown Plus 4**\n\n\nNearly got caught with my Journal, Had to quickly hide it. Anyway, Hell sucks, but the thing is, most people here are mortal souls, and die shortly after arriving! Who knew, Souls can die. Sadly though, I am neither mortal or a soul. All because I thought I was clever.\n\n\nHave to hide the Journal Now - Guards Coming.\n\n\n**Entry 3, Day Unknown plus a lot**\n\n\nTime is really hard to keep track of down here... Anyway, I might as well start telling just how I got into this situation.\n\n\nIt all started with a god damned Genie, as most good stories do. I was drunk off my ass one night and came across a random lamp in the middle of the dark alley I was puking my guts out in. After investigating it, I came across a Genie in the lamp. Last guy was a real idiot and thought the Genie only had two wishes, and for some reasons the Genies wishes don't reset until all three were used. Just my luc---\n\n*Ash covers the bottom of the page, as if it was dropped in a hurry*\n\n**Entry 4 Day who the Hell knows. Get it? HELL!**\n\n\nDespite the endless torture, my sense of humor is as shitty as always. Anyway, back to the Genie. I had one wish, and my drunk ass decided to ask to be fireproof. I mean it's not a TERRIBLE trait but like if I was in a fire I would still probably just choke to death on the smoke in time. Little did I know that I did not get the typical type of 'Fireproofing' most people think of. It all started one day when I accidentally lit my break room on fire after I left my spork in the Microwave with my mac and cheese. I fully expected to be fired that day, but then a miracle happened! My Boss just laughed it off! I was confused and in shock for the rest of the day until later that night when it dawned on me that I was literally fire-proof, I could not be fired! And that's when I began to scheme...\n\nGuards Coming, Will pick up Later.\n\n\n**Entry 5, Why am I still counting Days**\n\nSo, Me with my new found abilities decided to do the absolutely dumbest thing anyone could possibly think to do. I decided to summon Satan and try to get hired as an immortal henchman, and what do you know it worked! He signed a contract that gave me immortality as long as the contract remained valid. All it would take is me going out, reaping souls, torturing the damned, you know, the works! See I didn't plan on doing any of this. At first I thought that I would just be immortal and could just say 'Hey Satan, You cant fire me I'm Unfireable!'. And technically it worked, for about two weeks. See but I forgot the part that this is death, lord of hell. While he couldn't fire me, He sure as hell could torture the shit out of immortal me for being an arrogant prick. And well, that's where I'm at now. I tried to quit a while ago but the contract specifically said I would be his servant for all eternity, however long that is, and so I couldn't. No unions down here either.\n\n\nSo that's the story of how I am eternally damned to torture because I thought I could outsmart Satan.\n\n\n--------------------\nThis is my first attempt at doing a writing prompt and I know I have a lot to improve. If you have any suggestions please let me know, I am always trying to learn\n\n\n",

Bitch!\" I passed her by and turned around with a grin on my burned out lips and both my hands raised as high as my half-functioning muscles would allow. \n\n\"Ayyyy, nice one, Eric! My boss cheered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finished my morning routine by taking a shit in front of the office's kitchen and wiping my ass with Karen's (then unopened) bag of toast. I may not be fireproof. But I am, *fire-proof.*",

If you're willing to have a real conversation about it, the reason I have questions about this is: this character's asshole-ish tendencies are still obviously intended to make us laugh, and I wonder why. I think fiction, and what fiction people choose to consume, is still a reflection of real life, so what kind of behavior we find humorous and what we're willing to laugh at in fiction is to some extent a reflection of what behavior we find acceptable in real life as well. So I personally am not willing to find this behavior funny in fiction, because this behavior IS tolerated in real life in much of the world, perhaps even more than we think. Abuse of power, and sexual abuse of power, is not a joke, it's a reality, and if we laugh at it fictionally then we allow people to continue abusing their power in real life. ",

Harrassment in the workplace and indeed everywhere and for everyone shouldn't be tolerated. \n\nNow whether depictions of harassment in literature or any other creative medium desensitize people to it, I can't answer. Not objectively at least. Personally, I've read a lot of stuff where violence, sex, and abuse are predominant parts of the story. I don't think Game of Thrones makes people rape or kill. Your implication is similar to the argument against gaming (*It makes our children violent!*) etc. \n\nSo make of this what you will, I guess.\n\n",

Speaking out, and by extension having the discussions like this that follow is exactly my way of trying to be the change I want to see. I want to see more people speaking out against these things in real life, and want to see more people discussing them. Nothing changes if we don't talk, if we don't discuss, if we just roll our eyes at each other and move on. As such I do think we need to speak out against CASUAL fictional representations of such things. There are ways to represent a character like the one in this story, who harasses with impunity, that don't end with him just...wiping his ass with someone's bread and moving on. Too many people, and especially too many men, harass people in the workplace and on the streets with impunity in real life (in a figurative sense). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think my point is so much about desensitization as about reinforcing what's acceptable, if that makes sense. I do think media directs our thinking about what is broadly socially acceptable. Though it depends somewhat on the parenting as well (that's a whole other conversation I suppose). Game of Thrones largely shows consequences for the terrible things it depicts, and morally it intends to portray everyone, even the good guys, as being kind of in the grey area of morality. Video games - I think it depends on the video game! I do think explicit/graphic shoot em up games or fighting games potentially reinforce the idea that violence is ok to children who lean that direction already, or who perhaps see violence in their families. So again, that comes back to parenting to some degree. If I felt like society broadly understood the difference between media and reality I'd feel safer, but I don't think we draw enough of a line of separation between those things, and I think media bleeds into real life these days to a degree where we do need to be careful of the content, or make sure that the audience understands which part of the content is reprehensible behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is a lot of thoughts all bundled up, sorry if my thoughts are not that clear. Thanks for taking what I said before more seriously. ",

Then I backed into the CEO's car and somehow walked out with a promotion. I've delegated all my work to all my team and somehow three of them are getting laid off, and  I'm getting another raise.\n\nMy house burned down when I was 6; and I wished so hard to be 'fireproof', as in 'cannot get burned'. Turns out I can't get terminated. I've been here for six years. Million bucks, million ducks...twelve inch pianist, however that joke goes.\n\nTime to do some good. In my right hand I have a Corona, 'cause no one ever seems to care if I drink on the job. in my left hand; I've got a nasty little worm on a USB that's gonna show the world that this company has been laundering money - for who, I don't know and don't care. This baby is on a timer, and I'll be working at my new job before anyone notices.\n\nThree weeks later; and I'm still here. I miscalculated some of the coding and not only did the worm burn this company down from the inside, it fired 3 hours after I installed it. Of course ITSEC found my terminal prints all over it because I got lazy and sloppy. My future job called and rescinded my offer - who needs a whistleblowing snitch, am I right? I'm getting death threats and i'm effectively black-balled from working anywhere else. So I'm stuck here; essentially getting a check; getting eternal shade and side eye from all the other sheeple that work here. For a while I didn't mind; but rooms get silent when I walk in, like I'm Death. It takes a toll on a person.\n\nI guess that just goes to show that there is more than one way to burn yourself.",

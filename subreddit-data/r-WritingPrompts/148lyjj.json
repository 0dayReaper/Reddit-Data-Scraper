            "comment": "\"and that's just it... It feels like I'll never be able to move on from what happened...\"\n\n\nI take another sip of my beer as I watch myself pause and look away from the camera as I stare into space. When I recorded the video last night, that exact moment almost made me end it right then and there. Her terrified face, so clear in my mind. Yesterday's me stifles a growing tear, looking up to meet my glare once more.\n\n\n\"I don't know... I... I just don't know...\" I said, sighing, trying to find the words to say that might have brought me some semblance of peace but falling flat with every frantic attempt. I pause the video, staring myself in the eyes. My sadness in this moment is reflected in the me that was. That look... we both know it'll never leave us. As I gaze at myself, miserable and broken as I am. I can't help but keep on doing this... Somebody has too.\u00a0\n\n\nI press play, watching myself breath another sad sigh before getting ready to close up this iteration of the confession, the forty-third one so far... and the longest at that...\n\n\n\"I... I never wanted to hurt her. I never wanted to hurt anybody... I just... I lost my *fucking mind*...\"\n\n\nThose welling, incoming tears, how they would have erupted at that point, is what spurred me to stop filming. That's how they all end. I consider watching it again just to be sure, but twice is usually enough. Besides, once this one's over I'll be able to get some sleep... I can't remember the last time I did...\u00a0\n\n\nAs the video begins to upload I watch its progress tick up eagerly, becoming anxious with every last little increment. When it's finally ready, I drink the last of my beer before logging into the first account, and my eyes go dead.\u00a0\n\n\n'You aren't even human. Who could call themselves one after doing something like that? Despicable. I hope you rot in hell.'\n\n\nA little bit of the weight falls from me as I read it back again and again and again, only stopping once I feel the effect dissipate. As it goes away, the rage returns, and I log into my second alternate account and begin typing.\u00a0\n\n\n'Apologizing can not save you. There's nothing that will ever be said or done that ever could. You can't even accept that, can you? That's the saddest part here. Well, besides the life you destroyed, of course.'\n\n\nI feel myself go numb inside. The pain, it seems, is fractured. For now. I'm almost there. Account three. This one... It sees me. It knows the sickness inside, and it knows the only solution.\u00a0\n\n\n'You have to end this, now. Coming back here night after night with your pitiful little cries of \"Oh, it wasn't my fault. I wasn't well. I never wanted to-\" blah blah blah BULLSHIT. You know what you did to that girl. You know exactly what you did to her. And you know what? You know that what happened to her in the aftermath was all your fault too. It's your fault she's dead now. You know what to do.'\n\n\nThe following few hours are a circuit of bubbling misery as I revolve from comment to comment and back again, only stopping to select certain points of the paused video to scream into the monitor\u2026 right into my fucking face. After a while, my heart begins to slow down. My hands go limp. Then, I get ready for bed.\u00a0\n\n\nI only hope it'll be the last time.\u00a0",

They came from a sinkhole in the ocean that our scientists determined to be a mechanism much like a wormhole. Then came the ones that wanted our Earth. They crashed into our planet on a thousand meteorite-like vehicles made of a substance unknown to our universe. And at last, the ones who wanted our air and the ones who wanted our water. They came together from portals that eviscerated our poles. One for the south pole, the other for the north. Each had accomplished feats that had left our scientists baffled. And what was even more troubling--they all resembled humans.\n\nWe had tried greeting the ones who wanted our fire. We had sent them presents, precious metals, and the welcoming smile of our most expert convoys. They retaliated with a tsunami that wiped out Japan. It was magic, real magic. Something we had previously thought only existed in Hollywood and cartoons. With a few incantations, they could manipulate the water, the earth, even the air that we breathed. But they could not touch fire. So we gave them what they wanted. Napalm, incendiary bombs, hellfire missiles. They wanted our fire so bad? I hoped they like our gifts.\n\nThings were desperate but humanity was always at its best when pushed to the edge. Then came the Earth-Takers. At first, we had thought they were here to aid us in the invasion. They seemed enemies to the Fire-Takers and as the old saying goes--*the enemy of my enemy...* But though they were quick to attack each other, they were even quicker to attack us. These new aliens, they wanted our earth. So we gave it to those bastards with steel-tipped bullets, titanium-plated tanks, and a kinetic bombardment of tungsten launched from our satellites.\n\nBy the times the portals opened in the north and south poles, we already knew what to do.\n\nThese aliens looked like us but that was where the similarities ended. Everything they had ever wanted they had accomplished through magic. What would've taken humans years to do, they could simply chant and incantation to do so.\n\nThank God we never fell into the folly of magic. They have no idea what it means to move mountains by hand, to  conquer the skies armed only with dirt and stone, to create the greatest weapons in our known universe because we were pushed that far into the corner. Aliens this weak would never snuff out humanity.\n\nThat I promise you.\n\n---\n\nMichelle's pen stopped at the period. The walls around her shook. Bits of dirt crumbled from the ceiling onto her desk. The lights swayed, dancing the shadows around her. She had spent all night on this letter. It was the last one she would ever write and the first aimed at humanity's next generation, the generation of soldiers who had never experienced an alien free Earth.\n\n\"Michelle,\" came a voice from behind.\n\nShe turned to see her First General, Paxon, his feet together, shoulders stiff, and arms held to his head in salute. They had started the Resistance together when the governments crumbled and countries fell. At first, it had simply been a way to quell their anger as the other aliens fought for lands rightfully theirs.\n\nBlow a hole in a supply chain. Sabotage key communications. Small-scale things. But just as the aliens had done, she had underestimated humanity's grit. A million calls, e-mails, texts flooded her servers and as she strung them all together, the Resistance was born.\n\n\"At ease, General,\" she said.\n\nPaxon lowered his arm. \"Commander Gladstead, the Earth-Takers are approaching from the North in war balloons. Initial scouts report a tornado of fire dragged behind them.\"\n\nMichelle smiled at her friend. \"*At ease*,\" she said. \"Commander Gladstead? You sound like a grunt.\" She had always hated that title--commander. In a previous life, she was a pre-school teacher and now, men of the highest positions of power all reported to her.\n\nHer friend's shoulder dropped. \"As you command, Michelle.\" But this he said with a crescent grin. He knew how power annoyed her.\n\nShe ignored his smile. \"How are we holding up against the Fire-Takers?\"\n\n\"Still at a stale-mate, but not for long. We're almost out of missiles and our soldiers on the ground are being swallowed by the Earth itself.\"\n\nMichelle nodded. Not good news, but good enough. \"And at our East and West?\"\n\n\"The others are approaching. Their scouts are already here with their armies soon to follow.\"\n\nShe chuckled. Victory was always so bittersweet. \"Paxon,\" she said, \"get out of here. Tell everyone not in combat to do the same.\"\n\nHe didn't move. He pressed his lips together and stared at Michelle, humanity's commander, the last bastion of their old world, his friend. \"Come with me,\" he said, pleaded.\n\n\"We don't fool magic,\" Michelle said, a grin parting between her lips. \"They all came knowing full well that this is a trap and that's because the bait is just too good to pass off. Look at that, Michelle from podunk Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the greatest military asset in the world. Not bad, eh?\"\n\nPaxon coughed out a chuckle. He took a small breath and gritted his teeth. \"Commander, it's been an honor.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, General, I'll show them just how high the price is for the Resistance Commander.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\" The general straightened up, every one of his muscles stiff. He jabbed his forehead with his hand and returned Michelle the sharpest salute she had ever seen. Without another word, he left.\n\n\"Give 'em hell, General,\" Michelle whispered to the back of his head. She watched even as he turned the corner and disappeared into the underground corridors of their bunker. \n\nDrops of water followed him out.\n\nThe ground shook again. Another aftershock, another earthquake. Michelle stared at her letter. She nodded and put pen to paper.\n\n---\n\nWe are about to unleash the deadliest weapon humanity has ever conceived. We call it the hydrogen bomb. It is the combination of every single one of our elemental powers. The blast will consume their armies and leave their bases defenseless and when that happens, I have a single selfish request. Take everything from them. Go through their portals, their sinkholes, their spaceships and show them the true horrors of the war they have bestowed upon us.\n\nLong live humanity, the warriors without magic!\n\nMichelle Gladstead. Commander of the Resistance.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang. 2 new WP stories daily. If I continue any WP it'll be there and I'll give you bonus stories just for being my reader!

We picked up several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, and probed them all the way through. They're mostly water.\"\n\n\"So, does this planet have all 5 elements? Is that how they're able to be water?\"\n\n\"Nope. Just 4. This world has no magic.\"\n\n\"Wait, you mean to tell me this is a world filled with water creatures but no magic? How do they stay together?\" \n\n\"Apparently they're held together in vessels filled with meat.\"\n\n\"Oh don't start with that 'sentient meat' thing again. I got the last report from previous scouts in this sector. I'll believe them for now, but I have a hard time believing of sentient WATER.\"\n\n\"It's the same creatures.\"\n\n\"You're fucking kidding.\"\n\n\"I'm not.\"\n\n\"HOW CAN A CREATURE BE MADE OF BOTH SENTIENT MEAT AND WATER?\"\n\n\"Evidently the meat is powered by flowing rivers of water and iron, pumped through a main reactor in their chest. If they run out of water, they die.\"\n\n\"This is ludicrous! You're telling me we found a world that is absent of magic elements but has sentient meat/water creatures?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Okay. Fine. I'll... Take what I can in stride. So, what do they consume? There has to be some magical energies leftover from the colonization wars.\"\n\n\"They consume water, meat, and various plants grown from the ground.\"\n\n\"...No seriously.\"\n\n\"I'm only telling you what I observed.\"\n\n\"How in the everloving FUCK do they consume water? It's one of the most dangerous substances in this universe!\"\n\n\"Look, we didn't evolve the same way they did. Maybe their proximity to water caused them to require it on a regular basis.\"\n\n\"I got it. I got it. It must be the plants! The plants give off some kind of magical essence that allows them to consume water.\"\n\n\"No, they eat the plants for fiber, meat for protein, and water to keep themselves hydrated.\"\n\n\"...without magic?\"\n\n\"Without magic.\"\n\n\"...I don't believe this.\"\n\n\"Believe it or don't! This planet, apparently filled with meat life forms also has water flowing through them every day. There's even beings that live in the water.\"\n\n\"Live? IN WATER?\"\n\n\"Yup. We sent a probe down there... Well, as far as it could go before disintegrating... And found several life forms just swimming in it.\"\n\n\"NO MAGIC?\"\n\n\"I'm telling you! No magic! They exist not only with water, consuming water, but also living in water.\"\n\n\"Meat in water... This is... This is too much.\"\n\n\"What should we do?\"\n\n\"File a follow up report to the previous one. Send it back to base.\"\n\n\"Really? Do you think they'll accept it?\"\n\n\"Fuck no. You kidding me? They'll just file it in the back with the previous report. Nobody really wants to visit the planet that rains water, do they?\"\n\n\"Definitely not.\"\n\n\"Then it's decided. Write up the report.\"\n\n\"What's our next destination?\"\n\n\"Prep the ship to jump to sector TB66. At least it has magic to explain why life forms can exist alongside water.\"\n\n\"What element are they missing?\"\n\n\"Apparently they live on a planet of fire, but no earth. Their plants can grow using air and fire, but they only just discovered water as a weapon.\"\n\n\"Well of course, what else would you use water for?\"\n\n\"Exactly why nobody wants to come back to this planet.\"\n\n\"Indeed.\"\n\n- With all apologies to Terry Bisson",

It's fantastic to see him referenced immediately after hearing of him for the first time. What is this in reference to? This was so good I'm gonna go find my account with gold credits and hook you up, just brilliant mate.",

It's basically two aliens having a discussion of humans and they're completely perplexed by the fact that we're made of meat.\n\nHe posted it on his website recently:\n\nhttp://www.terrybisson.com/page6/page6.html\n\nAlso, a guy by the name of Stephen O'Regan made a silly short film based off of the story. He takes the material so seriously it's kinda funny. But it also has the former host of Cash Cab on it, so it's really fun to watch.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tScAyNaRdQ",

            "comment": "\"Please Alex, we need your help\", whimpered the hulking, wolf-like creature sitting at my doorstep. \"The survival of my kind balances on a precipice - should we fall, it would mean our extinction.\" A vestige of saliva dribbled down its mouth and quickly became lost in its shaggy coat.\n\nI should have slammed the door on it, or called the police or, well, just about *anything* other than what I did.\n\n\"Would you like a cup of tea?\" I asked, as I gestured it inside. I never knew why I said it, but perhaps it was because I felt pity for the wretched thing. Its fur was drenched from the night's rain and it was shivering terribly; in its huge cobalt eyes, I swear I saw tears welling. The weight of the world seemed to rest on this creature's broad shoulders.  \n\nIt pushed itself up with its front paws onto its great hind-legs. It walked slowly towards me, its breath wafting up my nostrils and signalling that the end was fast approaching.\n\nBut I was wrong; the creature leaned forward and put two great paws around my shoulders. Then, it licked me. It's slobbering tongue, the texture of damp sand-paper, ran up my face from chin to ear. I stood paralysed as he strode through the doorway. Saliva dribbled down my cheek, before falling off and exploding onto the floor. \n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, as he shook himself dry over my imitation Persian rug. I grimaced.\n\n\"My name is Driptooth,\" he continued. \"Mind if I...\" he asked, pointing towards my armchair.\n\n\"I'd prefer if you-\" but he'd already leapt onto it; he quickly curled up, wrapping his tail around him for warmth.\n\n\"What do you know of the five universes?\" he asked, as he wiggled his bottom deeper into the seat. \n\n\"The five...\"\n\n\"You do know of the five universes, do you not Alex?\"\n\n\"I-  I don't even know what *you* are,\" I snapped. \"I sure as hell don't know what you're going on about! You seem to be some kind of very well-spoken, lilac-furred, *wolf creature*, that *somehow* knows my name - and that I've very foolishly let into my home. You've practically ruined my best seat and you're probably going to eat me. Or perhaps I'm just imagining things, in which case I must have some kind of head-condition and I need to urgently visit my local GP!\"\n\n\"Calm down, Alex,\" it said, in a deep, soothing voice. \"Take a seat. Let me explain.\" \n\nIts tone and intonation were somewhat hypnotic, and I found myself drifting over to the sofa opposite Driptooth.\n\n\"Your universe is not alone. There are more - four more, to be precise.\"\n\n\"Of course...\" \n\nHe snarled and I quickly shut up.\n\n\"Each universe is missing one of the creation elements. Water, Earth, Fire, Air, or Magic. My universe is missing Water.\"\n\n\"You have no water? Then how are you even dribbling?\" My head was swimming. \n\n\"Let's just say, it's not water.\"\n\n\"Wait, did you say *magic?*\"\n\nHe growled again. \"Yes. Each universe lacks an element. Your lacks magic. That's how I got here, of course - although it should **never** be used in that way!\" He bared his teeth and seemed angry with himself.\n\n\"Oh. Of course. Magic's a thing.\"\n\nHe held a paw out in front of him and uttered inaudible words. Suddenly, there was a rather sharp looking rock resting on his paw. \n\n\"You... created a rock?\"\n\n\"I transported it,\" he corrected. \"And it's a *scratching* stone.\" Even as he said the words, he'd begun rubbing it deep into his fur. Dribble oozed out of his mouth like water from a tap in desperate need of a plumber.\n\n\"Okay!\" I shouted, hoping to protect my armchair from a further downpour. \"I get it. You can... magic.\"\n\n\"Yes! And as you can see, *I* can do it even in your universe, although not to the same extent. Alex,\" He began to speak softly, \"I have travelled a long way and risked much to seek your help.\"\n\n\"You came all the way here for me? Why?\"\n\n\"In each universe there is a master of a single element - a creature that can use it and manipulate it like no other. In this universe, you are that person.\"\n\n\"I'm... I'm just a fire-fighter,\" I replied. \"I can't do anything special.\"\n\n\"Ah-ha!\" he exclaimed, as he leapt out of his seat and onto his hind legs. \"I *knew* you were the right person. Although you had me wondering for a while!\" He let out a loud, satisfied howl; ornaments and pictures began to shake.\n\n\"How can I be the right person?\" I asked in disbelief.\n\n\"Because you fight fire, of course.\" He sighed, and sunk back down into the armchair. \"Two of the four universes have made an alliance. They now control all five elements, and together have already wiped life from one universe. They are intent on doing the same to mine. Once they have destroyed us, they will destroy you.\" \n\n\"I'm very sorry, but what can *I* do?\"\n\n\"They use fire against us. My family - entire species - will burn if you do not help me. \"\n\n\"You think **I** can stop it?\"\n\n\"If you can't,\" he let out a high pitched whimper and looked down at the floor.\n\n\"I guess.... I guess I could try,\" I said.\n\nHe leapt up and licked my face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         ",

            "comment": "At first, Michelle\u2019s quite sure the other woman\u2019s a lunatic. She touches Michelle on the arm in the train station -- deserted as always at 4 in the morning -- and smiles lightly. Giant, colorful wings bounce behind her. Even next to the deep hue of Michelle\u2019s own skin, this woman seems impossibly dark. \u201cHello!\u201d she chimes, in a voice soft and low, and strangely musical. \u201cI\u2019ve come from another world, and your world is very strange. Would you like to see my world?\u201d\n\nMichelle rolls her eyes discreetly and reaches for her mace. \u201cOf course. What is your world called?\u201d she asks, very pleasantly. The woman smiles, a stunning gleam of bright gold in her face. *Wait, gold?*\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called Nuniter! And I am called Calia!\u201d She holds Michelle\u2019s arm. Then the world whisks itself away, trotting like an overly-excited horse. \n\nThen Michelle thinks, *Oh. A dream.* Nothing else could explain the vibrancy of this woman in the dullness of the train station, or the way that the landscape shifts while it leaves, and then twists into something else entirely. *Definitely a dream.* And then she\u2019s on her feet again, walking after Calia. The ground seems strange, though, and so she looks down.\n\nIt\u2019s white. Spongey, and soft-looking, and *white*. She squeaks. \u201cOh, yes! I forgot to explain! You see, I\u2019ve been to each of the five worlds, and each is a little different. I did a thinking bit, and you see, we haven\u2019t got what you call \u2018dirt\u2019.\u201d Calia delivers that, looking far too excited, before she blinks and frowns. \u201cIf I remember right, you would call what we\u2019re walking on \u2018clouds\u2019?\u201d\n\nMichelle squawks out, \u201cWh-what? But clouds are\u2026 are too light\u2026 That\u2019s impossible! There\u2019s no way we\u2019re in the sky!\u201d\n\nCalia giggles gently. \u201cFollow me!\u201d Michelle does, awed and confused. After a few minutes\u2019 walk, they draw to a stop by a railing, leading up to a bridge. \u201cLook over!\u201d Calia urges.\n\nDoing so sends Michelle\u2019s heart into her stomach. For when she looks over, she looks down, and down, and down, and down. So far below it\u2019s unbelievable, she sees vast fields of blue, stretching to either end of the horizon. \u201cBut\u2026 if there\u2019s no earth, no dirt, what\u2019s the core of the world made of it?\u201d she mumbles, staggering away from the railing and holding her head.\n\n\u201cMagic, silly!\u201d Calia giggles. Michelle looks at her like -- well, like she\u2019s a damn idiot.\n\n\u201cMagic\u2019s not real,\u201d she states, very flatly. \n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s not for you, but it is here! You see, each world misses something the others have. Yours is missing magic, but we\u2019re missing \u2018earth\u2019, and another one\u2019s missing air\u2026 and stuff!\u201d Calia shrugs and laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s all very strange, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I know there\u2019s magic?\u201d Michelle asks, crossing her arms. *There are limits.*\n\n\u201cWell, how do you think we got here, silly?\u201d Calia tosses her silvery-white head of hair and laughs again. \n\n*God, that\u2019s getting annoying. She laughs too much.* \u201cStill not proving it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, and there\u2019s the wings!\u201d Finally, Calia stops laughing and\u2026 flaps her wings. Michelle expects nothing. Instead, Calia shoots into the air and twirls before landing. \u201cThe wings aren\u2019t natural, you see. We attach them magically after someone comes to maturity. How else would we get from cloud to cloud?\u201d\n\nMichelle\u2019s head hurts. \u201cOh,\u201d she mumbles.\n\n\u201cYou know, I bet you\u2019d really like seeing the other worlds too! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Calia gasps. She latches onto her arm again. The world spins away again, this time going at a gallop. \u201cIt always takes so long to travel from Laecma -- that\u2019s your world -- because there\u2019s just *no* magic! At all! Going  elsewhere is just\u2026 so much faster. It\u2019s probably why less people from the other worlds have gone in the last few millenia.\u201d\n\nNow they\u2019re in the middle of vast, vast fields of the lushest and strangest grass Michelle\u2019s ever seen. It\u2019s as vibrantly blue as the sky, and the sky shimmers a pale green above them. \u201cWhat is this world?\u201d she asks, both curious and a little afraid. \n\n\u201cOh, this is Seewa!\u201d Calia tells her. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any water here! None at all!\u201d Just thinking about it makes Michelle thirsty.\n\n\u201cWhat do they drink, then? And what about the plants? Is that why the grass is\u2026 blue?\u201d Michelle wonders out loud.\n\n\u201cWell, for the drinking, they have lots of things to drink. None of them are very *pleasant*, it\u2019s true, but they do have lots.\u201d Calia wrinkles her nose. \u201cThe most prevalent is what they call \u2018acier\u2019. It burns going down. *A lot*.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the plants?\u201d She kneels down and picks a piece of the grass, studying it. It\u2019s rather like the sawgrass she ran into on one field trip. But it\u2019s *blue*. \n\n\u201cIt still rains, and things, but it\u2019s not water.\u201d She looks up in time to see Calia\u2019s shrugs. \u201cWe\u2019d better go, though. I see one of the people who live here.\u201d Calia leans over and stage whispers, \u201cThey\u2019re not very friendly.\u201d\n\nJudging by the bellow that follows their standing, it\u2019s true. As Calia whisks them away, Michelle catches a glimpse of someone wide and broad, just like the grass, thundering down on them with anger in its pastel blue face. \n\nAnd then, they\u2019re somewhere cool. Her eyes fail her at first, but then she picks shapes out of the darkness. Just as her eyes adjust, something bright flares into existence at her side. Startled, she shies away -- but it\u2019s Calia. The other woman\u2019s wings flicker between colors, but stay close to a soft orange light. \u201cThis is the world without fire,\u201d she says, almost solemnly. \u201cThey\u2019re very serious, you see. It gets so cold at night, and they\u2019ve got nothing to warm them without magic. Not a lot of people have magic here, you know. They have to be serious in order to survive.\u201d\n\nSomeone looms out of the darkness, and calls mournfully, \u201cWho goes there?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Tis just I, Calia! Don\u2019t worry, Prinkaire!\u201d she calls back. \u201cI\u2019ve met someone from Laecma, and they were interested in the sights, you see!\u201d\n\nA heavy sigh precedes the person appearing in the circle of light. Whoever it is has the squarest, longest face Michelle\u2019s ever seen. The way they look reminds her of an albino, almost. \u201cVery well, Calia,\u201d it sighs. \u201cJust leave quickly. The hunter\u2019s bands have been bad lately.\u201d\n\nShe sniffs. \u201cAs if I\u2019d let one of those magic-stealing *tikrari* take *my* magic!\u201d She beams at him and turns to Michelle. \u201cMichelle, this is Prinkaire, He-Who-Warms-The-Outskirts. He\u2019s very good at it, too!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel all that cold, though?\u201d Michelle asks, eyeing the thick clothes the man wears.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s doing his job, silly!\u201d Calia chides her. Then they\u2019re off again, galloping through the borders of the world. This time, Michelle remains focused enough to see the edges of the fireless world, and then the edges of\u2026 whatever comes next. \n\n*No earth, no water, no fire\u2026 no air?* Then it occurs to her. *I breathe air!* \u201cShit! Calia, I --\u201d\n\nHer mouth fills with water. She gulps, and struggles, and --\n\nDoesn\u2019t drown. \u201cWhat?\u201d she mumbles, looking at the winged woman who\u2019s bent over cackling.\n\n\u201cI love doing that to people!\u201d she finally howls. \u201cEvery time!\u201d\n\n\u201c....thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, this is the world without air! Welcome to Diawa!\u201d Calia claps her hands and flutters her wings. \u201cYou\u2019re breathing the water because of --\u201d\n\n\u201cMagic?\u201d Michelle guesses. Calia nods and grins. \n\n\u201cAnd I teleported us right into one of the paths the guards like, so you can meet some of the Diawi!\u201d Seconds later, soft trills touch Michelle\u2019s ears. She turns toward the sound inquiringly.\n\nWhat approaches leaves her gasping. Every myth, every tale she\u2019s heard of mermaids, left her unprepared for what they might be like. The people approaching are iridescent, glimmering in the light, with long faces and eyes set too wide in their heads. But they\u2019re *beautiful*.\n\n\u201cTouring again, Cal?\u201d one purrs. It\u2019s not words. Somehow, Michelle understands it.\n\n\u201cOf course! I love visits!\u201d Calia trills back. \u201cAnd I have a visitor.\u201d\n\nThe underwater dwellers turn to Michelle and do what she *thinks* is a nod. \u201cGreetings, stranger. Do you come from Laecma? You do not bellow, nor have you wings, and your skin stays too dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I do,\u201d she replies. Their voices aren\u2019t voices. Instead, they seem like songs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better get back, though! I think she\u2019s going to miss her traim! Train? Tram? Whatever!\u201d Calia chirps. The world blurs again. The thick, soupy water turns into the familiar polluted air of home. All the light, filtering through untold depths, turns into the dull drone of overheads. \u201cI hope you liked the visit! Can I come visit you again? I like visiting!\u201d she asks, hovering in front of Michelle in the still-abandoned station.\n\nAll Michelle can think of is, \u201cYes. Yes, please.\u201d Then Calia disappears in a burst of color. Michelle sits down hard, in the middle of the station, and stares ahead.\n\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d she breathes. Nothing seems the same anymore. \"Definitely not a dream.\"\n",

Five days ago, we were introduced to such a substance and such an amount. I am Dr. Nufus Donnard, lead scientist of the M project (multiverse project). We are responsible for this disaster. \n\nFive days ago, we turned on the particle collider. Harnessing the energy of the Earth, funneled through the Grand Magis, we collided two heavy particles of lead. Our theory was the destruction of the particles we create a void in our universe that would force a tear into another and create a channel for mass to flow from one into the other. We tried for years with lighter particles, but they broke and scattered before any channel could be made. As I calculated, lead would have a high probability of success. \n\nOn April 25th, 2025, the Grand Magis were summoned to the Brediok Particle Collider in Brediok, Naster. Perched atop the volcano of Naster, the Magis drew the power from the Earth. Life was born from the fires of the Earth. We grew from the flames. It only seems appropriate that our meddling with the ways of life created our downfall. \n\nThe Grand Magis came to the mountaintop in their silken gowns. They were bright purple against the colourless sky. Their hands of silicon and carbon poked out and veils of fire that brought their bodies to life began to brighten. The volcano rumbled to their chanting as the two particles of lead drifted above our heads. It was beautiful. \n\nThe group of Magis danced back and forth, using their craft to accelerate the particles faster and faster. Like two tectonic plates tangoing they heaved and bashed until at last their hands met in the center and the particles collided. \n\nIn a blinding flash, the particles met and the sky twisted. There were no sounds, just the rupturing of infinite universes trying to find balance. Then, a liquid began to pour. Not like lava, or the blood in our veins, but soft and cooling. First, it trickled and then it gushed. It spread across the volcano, killing the Magis, then spilled over the edge of the volcano. It spread into the valleys and didn't stop until our world was separated by this blue, clear liquid. \n\nThe liquid has stopped pouring, but the damage remains. We agreed to call it water, for it seemed to be a name that sprung to all our minds. Now the sky is blue and our planet is covered in this lethal substance. Fall into it and it extinguished your life. And for what it's worth, it appeared the lethal dose to kill 50% of our population was 1.332e^21 liters. ",

            "comment": "It was all chance.  Some bullshit about all five of our Earths occupying the same exact space in each of our respective universes so that the concentric gravitational pulls opened some kind of wormhole.  It appeared somewhere around each of our south poles.  At first, interactions between us were limited, but friendly.  It didn't take long for everything to fall apart, though.\n\nThose of us on Earth Prime can't even exist peacefully with ourselves, much less with FOUR other Earths full of people with the same exact problem.  Once relations DID break down, it quickly became apparent that we on Prime were outmatched.  They had freaking MAGIC.  Sure, each of them were missing some \"element\" too, but that didn't matter when they could create impenetrable force fields, summon lightning, or create amazing constructs at will.\n\nOur southern hemisphere became the battleground.  Antarctica, shattered.  Australia, ravaged.  Southern Africa and much of South America, obliterated.  We couldn't stop them, so the four magic using Earths fought it out in the south, while we retreated to the north.  That was 15 years ago.  When I was young, my father told me that what people used to call magic was just science that hadn't been explained yet.  It turns out, that was true in this case, too.\n\nThe other Earths don't have science, because magic is natural on their planets.  But, our scientists discovered that \"magic,\" just like our \"elements,\" water, earth, fire, and air, is just a compound of chemical elements from the periodic table.  Different combinations of elements resulted in different \"magical\" effects.  My name is Captain John Paul Woodard.  My four man strike team and I are the first soldiers in the multiverse to ever be trained in combat using all five \"elements.\"  Our mission?  Take back our Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nHi guys, I'm not really a writer, but I saw this prompt and got an idea that I thought was kinda neat.

            "comment": "Earth November 23, 2078 \n\nA Distinguished physicist named Sergi Yuzebabenko crated a small wormhole like portal that may possibly lead to an alternate universe. \n\nEarth December 5, 2078 \n\nSergi successfully crated a portal to an alternate universe, drones were sent through to investigate the alternate universe. Preliminary readings indicate a total lack of volcanic or geological activity, the planet seems to be made of scattered small lakes and huge plains covered with tall grass.\n\nEarth December 10, 2078 \n\nSergi's project was confiscated by the UN, in exchange for his continued work in the project he was allowed to lead the project but under the supervision of General Davis.\n\nEarth December 12, 2078\n\nA drone had been damaged, last images sent back seem to indicate it was shot down by a strange energy source. The \"plains planet\" was officially declared hostile and a permanent UN peace keeping presence was stationed at the lab.\n\nEarth December 20, 2078\n\nGeneral Davis orders a squad of spec ops personnel lead a recon mission and establish a forward operating base as soil samples from the plains planet indicated that the soil is 100 times more fertile than any soil found on earth.\n\nEarth January 5, 2079\n\nA team consisting of over 300 hundred Seals, Green berets and Spetsnaz was sent through the portal to establish a forward operating base.\n\nApproximately 5 hours after the team, now designated alpha team, they encountered a small group of humans that seemed to be primitive in technology, it was discovered that they were the group that had shot down the drone. After some contact it was discovered that they spoke Latin. \n\nEarth January 6, 2079\n\nAlpha team establishes a small base. Light jeeps were sent through the portal and were retrieved by alpha team. At the request of the Russian contingent, several M2 Abrams and T1009 tanks were also sent. 100 scientists, including biologists, physicists, ecologists and doctors were sent through along with 300 UN   regular infantry.\n\nEarth January 9, 2079\n\nDoctors examine the native inhabitants of the natives of the plains world and to their surprise find they are resistant to all diseases that they encountered from the initial expedition. A purple fluid was discovered in the natives blood, it has been dubbed ether.\n\n\nEarth January 13, 2079 \n\nNews of the alternate world was annoyed to the general public. A new UN board was created to govern how to handle relations with the natives of the plains world\n\nEarth January 29, 2079\n\nDrones find a large city on the plains world. It is inhabited by over 3 million natives.\n\nEarth February 4, 2079\n\nSeveral more native cities are found in the plains world. It is discovered that the natives lack the ability to create fire,\nthe natives seem to \"cook\" their food with the ether. \n\nEarth February 9, 2079 \n\nSeveral physicists come to the conclusion that the ether follows no known laws of physics. The natives seem to harness it with their mental abilities alone.\n\nPlains world February 18, 2079\n\nA crop of corn was successfully grown to maturation, 900 UN regulars were sent from earth to fortify the base and expand the defense capabilities, an air strip was constructed and 5 Z-9 attack jets were received. 300 more scientists arrive along with a UN envoy\n\nPlains world February 21, 2079\n\nEnvoy attempted to make contact with a native city, natives fired upon the envoy guards and personnel, only 3 survivors made it back to base\n\nPlains world February 23, 2079 \n\nGeneral Davis along with 10000 regular UN infantry arrive from earth, the UN has decided that the opportunity to harness the plains world can not be lost, as almost all soil on earth has been poisoned by pollution.\n\nPlains world February 24, 2079 \n\nSeveral more attack vehicles arrive from earth. Construction of walls around the base begins.\n\nPlains world  March 3, 2079\n\nWalls construction is completed \n\nPlains world March 10, 2019\n\n600 framers arrived from earth along with several tons of corn, watermelon and strawberry seed.\n\nPlains world March 11, 2079 \n\nCivilian population quarters are constructed \n\nPlains world March 12, 2079\n\n\nFarming begins\n\n\nPlains world March 21, 2079\n\n\nA large population of natives were detected with a direct heading for the base, several artillery batteries are recived from earth on priority. They were  ready to fire within hours of arrival\n\nPlains world March 25, 2079\n\nThe large native force consists of 15000 males who seems to be armed with ether enabled weapons, their leader meets with general Davis, he remarks \"they want us to leave and never come back, let's show them what we are made of\" \n\nPlains world March 26, 2079\n\nThe native army is within 2 km of the base, general Davis informs the native  leader that he has no intention of withdrawing\n\n\nPlains world March 27, 2079 \n\nThe native army attacks the base, artilley and aerial bombardment wipe out most of the attacking force before  they arrive at the base, fires spread throughout the grass fields and what was left of the natives forces burn alive \n\nPlains world April 9, 2079 \n\n\nGeneral Davis travels to he largest native city along with 6000 men and several attack vehicles to demand complete capitulation, the natives agree \n\n\nPlains world April 12, 2079 \n\n\nThe plains world is officially declared a territory of the United Nations of earth, the natives are allowed to Live on 1/2 of the planet as long as they agree to give up their ether weaponry, they agree\n\n\n\nHope you guys liked. if you guys want I can do more. \nThank you for your time reading this it is appreciated. \n\n",

            "comment": "I flipped the switch, and took a deep breath. As expected, a portal appeared in the center of the room, labeled with the number 3. I knew that the five universes each lacked one of the five elements. We were universe 5, and we lacked magic. The others were missing earth, water, fire, and air, respectively. Everyone in the room knew this.\n\nI thought a little about how misleading calling the elements earth, water, fire and air were. For any one thing, exactly one of the five universes was missing it. Each of the 4 elements besides magic stood for one state of matter; earth was solid, water was liquid, air was gas, fire was plasma. Fire also meant energy. Going into a universe where we couldn't stand, couldn't drink or couldn't breathe was unfeasible, so we had to start with the other one.\n\nI felt a little pang of regret, of course. We had developed this portal machine for reasons that were not exactly moral. We wanted to invade each universe and plunder them. Actually, I didn't want to harm the universes; the people who commissioned me to work on this did. Oh well. People were marching into the portal in their spacesuits already to invade the universe without fire. I was to follow.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that it was bitterly, bitterly cold, even with my suit on. The second was that nearly nothing moved. Only what we touched moved. The air was nearly still. \n\nWe marched for a long time. After what felt like hours, we spotted a humanoid, floating in the air and seemingly defying gravity. Of course we had to go talk to it.\n\nI'm kidding, of course. One of us provoked it by throwing a spear at it. It bounced off with a clink. The humanoid slowly turned its gaze to us.\n\n\"Is it a war you want, fools? I know it is. You should have known that nothing in this universe can harm us. That is how we have taken over its entirety! Now, you will die!\" With those words a swarm of similar beings leapt upon us with surprising speed.\n\nThen, in an extremely anticlimactic turn of events, someone threw a stick of dynamite, detonated it, and killed every single one. They disintegrated.\n\nI felt a little disoriented, and a little bit shocked that such a proud warrior race could be so easily wiped out with a few sticks of dynamite. \n\nBut of course, we had to continue.

            "comment": "I am not an experienced author so any feedback would be appreciated :) This doesn't exactly fit the prompt but I liked the idea of an origin story.\n\n______________\n\n\nIn the beginning there was nothing. Then there was a Something.\u00a0 This Something was a great being, made of five elements, swirling into a colossal form that sparkled like a star, flowed like a river, swirled like the wind, moved like a boulder and it's mind was pure magic.\u00a0 But no matter how beautiful this Something was, it was alone.\n\n\nThe Something was so very lonely that it took parts of itself and began creating, for it was better to be smaller with something else to share it with. \n\n\nThe first thing it made was a ball of earth, with water to bind it, and warmed by fire, and some magic so it could talk with the Something. They spent many long conversations discussing where they came from. \n\n\nThe second thing it made was a nebulous cloud of steam, heated by flame, and of course, a sparkle of magic so it could talk. It loved to talk about why they were here, and their place in the universe.\n\n\nThe third thing it made was dense and rocky and scorched by fire that raced around it, with gusts of wind to keep its blazing furnace skin alight. Again, it had a coating of magic so they could discuss what they could achieve together.\n\n\nThe fourth thing it made was a great maelstrom of freezing dirt and air whirling round and round.\u00a0 By the time it came to give this thing magic the Something realised this was the last magic it had to give. It had kept back a little of everything else to ensure it could keep working, but it had enjoyed the conversation so much it had forgotten to save some magic.\u00a0 As the Something gave its last little piece of magic, it curled up into a tight ball in between its new friends and fell very quiet for a long long time.\u00a0 This fourth promised to protect the Something from all harm, for giving it life.\n\n\nWhile the Something may have been only earth, air, water and fire, it began to blossom and grow. Those questions it had asked, and the conversations enjoyed with its friends had woken something in its very skin, which called itself humanity. This humanity grew and questioned and gazed up at the sky where the four friends lived and in time called them planets.\n",

            "comment": "The initial plans called for a phalanx of special forces to accompany Jamie \u2013 two to flank his side, another forty-eight to encircle the sprawling mansion in the upperclass suburbs, all with strict orders to contain any disturbance with extreme prejudice. \n\nJamie had finally convinced his bosses to see things his way. \u201cLook, I was the one who brought her in, I can get her to cooperate. Even if she reacts\u2026 unexpectedly,\u201d Jamie had said, tapping the vest they had fitted over him, \u201cI\u2019ll be able to handle it with this, right?\u201d\n\nEventually, only one other agent was assigned, and even he was left to stand watch at the end of the long driveway, nervously peering into the darkness as Jamie crossed the lawn, alone, to rap sharply on the ornate mahogany door.\n\n\u201cYou promised me I would be left alone,\u201d hissed the voice, bouncing around sharply in the confines of Jamie\u2019s skull.\n\n\u201cLwellyn, you have no idea the lengths I\u2019ve gone to keep you safe,\u201d growled Jamie, a note of irritation creeping into his voice. It was true, and righteous indignation swirled in his belly, which he fought to suppress. \u201cBut I am one lone man, trying to make the best of a right shitshow, so forgive me if you are to be disturbed.\u201d\n\nThe door swung open on its own, and the d\u00e9cor within was as Jamie expected of a designer who, having been forbidden to use her favourite colours or motifs, had suddenly been set free to do as she would.\n\nIn other words, there was running water, everywhere. An arresting fountain took centre-stage in the hall, bubbling as the water jets twirled and spun gracefully in the air. Two double-storey waterfalls, cleverly-designed waterspouts from on high, gushed into swirling pools. Streams of water, chugging along inset rivulets, ran across the length of the floor.\n\nLwellyn snapped her fingers, and suddenly, all the water ceased. They did not stop, in the way that one may expect if a tap were turned off. Rather, all the water froze where they were, transfixed in motion, as if it were all a streaming video which was in the midst of buffering.\n\nLwellyn saw the look in Jamie\u2019s eyes, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been here ten years, Jamie, and still I cannot believe your Homeworld takes for granted what we struggle so hard to replace. So forgive me my indulgences.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, I suppose I would have done the same thing,\u201d said Jamie, a wistful edge to his tone, \u201cEvery inch of my home would be filled with every trinket, vessel or embodiment of Magic I could lay my hands on. I understand the allure of what we do not have, Lwellyn, very well.\u201d\n\nIt was somewhat ironic that even though Jamie was the leader of the global think-tank which specialized in advising world governments on trans-world relations, he had never personally crossed over into any of the other Homeworlds. He was intimately aware that crossing over was safe, that one only had to prepare the necessary substitutes \u2013 for example, Lwellyn\u2019s Homeworld, Dessicae, possessed the elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Magic in abundance, but Water was notably absent, so that had to be brought along.\n\nEarly forays had determined that it was Magic which had, in a sense, adapted to help Dessicae survive despite the absence of Water. Magic was intangible, omnipotent, and it flowed so richly in Dessicae that it filled in all the roles which Water would normally have played on Jamie\u2019s Homeworld. Subsequent reports confirmed that it was the same on the other Homeworlds \u2013 regardless of which element was missing on that Homeworld, Magic was the glue which bound them all together.\n\nIt was only on Jamie\u2019s Homeworld, where Earth, Air, Fire and Water were all present and accounted for, that Magic had, perhaps deciding that it had no role to play, slinked away.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be a courtesy call,\u201d said Lwellyn, eyes narrowing, \u201cI am indebted to you, but not once since you took me in as a refugee have you ever called on me in a personal capacity. It has always been about work, and this cannot be different.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are astute, and I shall be blunt then. I\u2019ve come to ask for you to unlock the Portal to your Homeworld.\u201d\n\nJamie\u2019s request hung in the air, and eventually Lwellyn laughed. \u201cYou must be joking. How do you expect me to be able to do tha-\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will inform Dessicae that we have finally hunted you down, rooted you out from your hiding place amongst our populace. You will return a political prisoner, but our operatives will be in place to spring you out. We just need you, as a native, to weave the spells needed to fully open the Portal to Dessicae. Once that is done, your debt is clear, and you can return here to live out the rest of your life in peace.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd why the hell would I do that?\u201d\n\nJamie had anticipated this question. He had two answers prepared, the first being an appeal to logic. He would show Lwellyn the collected data, that the four elements in Jamie\u2019s Homeworld were irreversibly poisoned, and that open channels were needed to the other Homeworlds so that the tainted elements could be replaced. Negotiations for peaceful acquisition of resources were stalling, and time was running out.\n\nFrom that perspective, the problem was suddenly a matter of national, nay, global security.\n\nAnd to round off the logical explanation, Jamie would have pointed out that when it came down to a matter of global security, a certain amount of force was allowed, and the opening of the Portals was the first step to a policy they had termed \u201cEnforced Survival\u201d.\n\nBut Lwellyn was not susceptible to logical arguments, as Jamie\u2019s memory served him, so instead he said, \u201cWe have reason to believe your daughter is alive in Dessicae. These photographs were taken just last month. You won\u2019t just be helping your adopted Homeworld survive, you will be bringing your daughter home.\u201d\n\nJamie\u2019s hands were already on his vest, and his personal Barrier was activated mere seconds before Lwellyn\u2019s psychic scream tore through the mansion. Part guilt for abandoning the child she thought had died all those years ago, part anguish for not doing more, part shame for moving on when her own flesh and blood still suffered in Dessicae, the Magic spilled out of Lwellyn, a malevolent manifestation of her pain.\n\nOutside, a hundred feet away, the special agent crumpled to his knees, grabbing his head in pain. The hidden gears and circuits in Jamie\u2019s vest toiled on, shielding him more than adequately. Jamie gave the woman, sobbing poignantly on the floor, a full minute before he pressed his case.\n\n\u201cWill you help us open the Portal? I have three others like you to meet tonight, Lwellyn, and I really need an answer.\u201d\n\nThe angry, determined\u2026 *hungry* look in her eyes was all the answer he needed.\n\n---\n\n/r/rarelyfunny ",

            "comment": "We should have known.\n\nWhen the Waterless came to our dimension, it was the first we had heard of the fifth element. Magic! No longer was it a mere story. We were enthralled by these beings that came from a world without water. This was what scientists had dreamed of. This was First Contact. We welcomed them and their magic to our dimension and offered them gifts of our purest water. The moment the Waterless envoy touched it, he dissolved.\n\nThe Earthless were like friendly spirits, traversing life and space as an ethereal combination of magic, water, fire, and air. They came in peace, to learn and to trade. The elements that made up our Earth were poison to them. They withered and faded in its presence. It was like watching souls die.\n\nWhen the Fireless came, those beautiful crystalline beings, we tried to warn them, but our warnings arrived too late. As soon as they encountered the heat of our dimension, they caught fire and melted. The crackling, the bubbling, the cries of agony - they were horrifying.\n\nThe Airless came armed with magic and greed, here to invade and take our precious Air that they were denied in their home dimension. The other dimensions had all devised magical protections to prevent such attacks; we, on the other hand, had no such defenses. The world panicked and prepared for a war we knew we couldn\u2019t win. We need not have worried. The moment the Airless entered our dimension, the air pressure crushed them like trash in a compactor.\n\nThe pattern was there. We should have seen it. We should have known.\n\nBut we were obsessed with the idea of magic. What was once a fantasy was now too much for us to resist. Generations of scientists dedicated their lives to finding a way into another dimension. Some of us dreamed of it, some gambled on it, some donated all we had to it, and all of us believed we would be the ones rewarded when the way was found. People lived and died with no other goal or dream but to reach magical worlds.\n\nWhen the breakthrough finally came and we found a way to breach the boundary between dimensions, humanity would tolerate no delays. A group of us embarked immediately to cross the interdimensional border.\n\nWhen we entered into the Earthless dimension, we found what we had come for. Magic. It crashed into us like a wave, filled us with power, echoed like a thousand songs through our hearts and our blood, intoxicated us like no drug ever could. We were beyond gods. We were everything.\n\nBut there was a reason no dimension had all five elements simultaneously. They couldn\u2019t exist in balance. When all five interacted, they became unstable. We should have seen it from what happened to the others who came to us. We should have known. The magic filled us, and then shattered us.\n\nWe used to wonder where dark matter came from.\n\nNow we know.\n\n\n***\n\nFirst time trying this. I hope I formatted it properly.  I know it's a bit late to the prompt, but I was inspired and wanted to try writing one. I'm a bit rusty since I haven't written in a long time.  Hope it's alright!",

            "comment": "\"... in short, our team has discovered a way to 'borrow' the magic of the other realms, creating an endless supply of free energy!\"\n\nI paused to glance at the room.  I have a really bad fake smile on my face.  This was my worst nightmare.  I hate crowds...  I hate talking...   And I really hate talking in front of crowds.  \n\nThe large projector that was showing my life's work was blinding me a little, but I could make out audience just a little bit.  They were all busy talking amongst themselves to even noticed that I had stopped talking.  Man, I really hate the press.   \n\nClearing my throat before I spoke again.   \"Ladies and Gentlemen, please.   I know it's hard to comprehend, but Magic is real.   \n\nIn the darkness, I could see a hand popped up from the crowd. Finally, somebody was showing some interest in my work.   I quickly turned off the projector, and the room lights turned out.  I excitedly pointed at the man and said \"Yes, yes, yes...  Sir, do you have a question?\"\n\nA slender white man stood up, \"You claim there are multiple universes, and you wish to 'steal' their magic...  Aren't you concerned about how the local population would respond?\"\n\n\"Well, we are not stealing anything...   Magic is free flowing in the other universes.  We just tap into it...  Like... Like Drilling for oil.\"\n\n\"So...  We're are just going into somebody's else backyard and drilling for Magic without their permission?  How is that not stealing?\" the man said quickly in a stern voice.\n\n\"No...  you don't understand...  We are not stealing anyth-\" I ended up muttering.\n\n\"You claim you have access to other universes, you're going to 'tap' into their source of magic without getting consent from anybody? How is that NOT stealing?\" yelled the reporter.\n\n\"Because...  There is NO local populace to speak of.\"\n\nI fumble with the projector controls.  I made a mistake and turned off the room lights before even turning on the projector...   Cursing at myself, I finally got the projector turned on and pulled up a chart showing all the different universes.  Angrily pointing at each type of universes we discovered.  \n \n\"Look here, Here...  See?   An universe with no earth.   You know what no earth mean?  It means no ground... No ground means no planets.  And I don't know what you think, but Life kind of needs a planet to...  Well, to live on. \" \n\nI angrily walk into the center of the projection, pointing at each universe types.  \"Oh, and guess what?  No water means there is no life either.   No air?  Guess what?   No life.   No fire?  That means no sun, no stars, no nothing.   Just a pile of hydrogen atoms floating around.\" \n\nAfter staring out into the darkness for far too long...  As I start calming down, I slowly start to come to the realization I might have made the biggest mistake of entire life.   Taking a few big breaths, I slowly walked off stage with my head hanging low.  What will the headlines read tomorrow?   'Scientist Discovers MAGIC ans saves the world'...   or...  Will it read, 'Crazy scientist loses it in front of everybody!'...\n\nMy wife comes up to me and said, \"It could be worse.\"\n\n\"How could it be worse?\"  I said frankly?   \n\nMy wife let out a small smirk and said, \"It could have be worse, if you didn't also happen to also discover endless amount of Magic energy that could rewind time.\"\n\n",

So here goes.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTel'na couldn't believe it. After all these years she could finally see the famous Great Crossing with her own cristaline eyes. For as long as she could remember, her father had told her of the only place in Mol'nt where the five worlds intersected. \n\nWhen first she had spotted it, the city had looked like the remains of a gigantic beast of the past. Its black stone buildings of disparate shapes looking like so many old bones against the bright orange dust of the dry plains.\nBut as the caravan approached, Tel'na could distinguish little specs of grey, silver and rust moving about the stone constructions. As they moved closer, she could see the specs were people pushing massive rocky carts around. Either carrying ore to the plaza where the portals were or coming back from it loaded with their exotic purchases.\n\nTel'na's clan aligned its carts with those of the other stone men and pushed forward. A lot of the buildings were closed but from the few that she saw still open, Tel'na deduced that they were storehouses. She noticed some crystals for magic containment like the ones they were carrying and some food-pebbles but a lot of things that she saw she didn't know. And had no words to describe them.\n\nUpon arriving at the central plaza, she could barely contain her excitement. Massed around the four portals were beings from all the worlds just like her father had told her.\n\n\"Dad ! Dad, look at them !\", she hollered.\n\"Tel'na, behave girl. Remember we are here for trade.\". His voice was calm as it always was. Barely showing any enthusiasm he motioned the caravan to stop.\n\"Yes, sorry. Would it bother you if I took a look around the plaza while you unload the carts ?\" she said, straining to speak slowly.\n\nHer father's granite face cracked up and a light smile showed. \"Fine, but take your brother with you so I can concentrate on the job.\"\n\"Thank you, Dad. Gar'ek come on !\".\n\nThe little rockling fell down the cart and skipped over to his sister, giggling all the way. Tel'na grabbed his bluish grey hand and inserted herself into the crowd. \nAs her eyes scanned the creatures around her, she remembered her father's lessons. \nThere were pairs of fish people from Pessym walking around in their coats of water held together by magic. Their world lacking any earth to walk on, they looked quite awkward as they slithered on sand and stone. The beasts from Nokris seemed more at ease with their long limbs covered in thick black fur. But when he noticed them, Gar'ek whined in fear as their faces lacked eyes. Their world had no fire or light and so those would have been useless to them.\n\nTel'na turned away from them and ended face to face with a cloud of red and purple energy. She frose and the living cloud just went through her like she wasn't there. She felt tiny sparks jump all over hher dense body and fell backwards. She was starting to gather her thoughts on the ground when she felt hands pick her up and put her gently back on her feet.\n\n\"Watch your step missy. These guys from Luzz are so used to their airless void that we barely register to them. And they pack quite a punch.\"\n\"Sorry I guess I wasn't paying attention. Thank you.\"\n\"Don't mention it. Want me to take you back to your mates?\" This being was probably a human from Terra although it was hard to tell what he looked like under the heavy protection he wore to guard himself against Mol'nt's burning sun and dry air.\n\"No it's alright. I'm taking a tour wit my b...\" Tel'na turned her head but all she could see around her were colorful strangers. Gar'ek was nowhere to be found.\n\n\"Oh no... Gar'ek ! Gar'ek where are you?\", she yelled bursting through the humans in front of her. She started running randomly, calling out to her lost brother. \n\nAfter a while she had to catch her breath and she stopped near the center of the plazza. She inhaled deeply, feeling a deep anguish building inside her. \n\nAnd then she saw him. He was right in front the portal to Terra, just standing there.\n\n\"Gar'ek stay there! Don't move!\", she yelled.\n\nHer brother waved at her cheerfully and then jumped through the portal.",

It looked similar, but the skin was like a dry lake bed and the lips had canyon fissures running through them. \n\n\"Water.\" It mouthed. \n\nI heard the voice in my head as if it were my own thought. A familiar voice with an unfamiliar hunger. \n\n\"Water.\" It groaned. Louder this time. In the increased volume I could feel the sharp desperation and longing in the dancing tones.\n\nI turned the sink tap and threw water at the reflection. Nothing happened. I could feel a fear rising within me. I pooled the water in my cupped hands and drank. The water was like nothing I had ever tasted before. The refreshing clarity trickled down my throat and hung in my gut. I let out a deep sigh, joined in harmony with a voice within. \n\nThe reflection ran its pine-cone tongue across its crumbling lips. \"More.\"\n\nI obliged. Not because of the command, but because I felt it too. The need for more. Again I lifted my hands to my lips and let the ice cold water sooth me. As soon as I swallowed, the great thirst swelled up again. The roof of my mouth felt coarse and my temple began to pound. The reflection didn't need to signal this time, I was already drinking deep. This humdrum tap water tasted like the freshest lake. \n\nThe reflection wasn't getting any less dishevelled though. As I drank repeatedly, it just stood there, breathing heavily. Nothing changed, on that end.\n\nMy panic began to set in as I felt an inconsolable itching in my eyes. Between gulps I had taken to rubbing them with my wet fingers for a moments relief. Springs of blood began to sweat from the cracks in my chapped lips. I took one last look at my reflection before bending over and spraying the tap full force into my mouth. Breathing was no longer a priority. I needed the water. \n",

I'll post an epilogue as a reply to this.\n\n**Our Own Kind of Magic**\n\nI know how to return to my realm, and it saddens me. The knowledge fills my mind as I draw it from the aether around me. With a thought, I conjure a notebook, much like the diary I lost in an endless, waterless desolation so many months ago. This realm has no earth, and thus no trees to produce paper, but I now understand how to coax the aether into creating nearly anything I desire. My thoughts transform into strokes of an invisible pen, and my new knowledge takes form as a set of instructions. As soon as I release my summoning, the new knowledge vanishes from my mind. Thankfully, my newly produced notebook holds the secrets I need to leave this realm.\n\nI stand on a cloud, suspended above an endless sea. Odd forms swim in the water \u2013 one\u2019s eye must be keen to distinguish the dark blue shapes flitting just under the surface. Beings of liquid, perfectly at home in an ocean with no shores.\n\nAbove me are more clouds, drifting lazily along, following the currents of the endless stratosphere. A cloud shaped like a stalactite dominates the view before me, hanging so that its tip is mere feet over the surface of the water. Like an inverted iceberg, the cloud expands upward, becoming so wide at its top that it blocks much of the afternoon sun.\n\nI draw aether from the air around me. This is the act I will truly miss \u2013 I have only just gained the ability to weave aether for myself, and I will soon give it up. My body grows lighter, and I float to the stalactite cloud. I am determined to see its residents one more time before I weave my way out of this realm.\n\nAs I approach the hanging cloud, I weave aether around my eyes. The cloud takes on subtleties invisible to the human eye. It now resembles an inverted, snow-peaked mountain with many small caves set at regular intervals. Grey bird-like forms fly between caves, and I direct my flight toward the nearest of those black openings. Just as I float to the mouth of the cave, one small bird-form flies before my face, a gust of playful wind accompanying its curiosity. I stop my approach, pocketing my notebook and floating in place as I address the creature.\n\n\u201cHello, being of air,\u201d I say, \u201cI am ever thankful to your kind. You taught me how to weave my own spells.\u201d\n\n\u201cStranger?\u201d I cannot actually hear this reply. I cannot even see the being that well, even though it is right before my eyes. It is a subtle thing, a kind of darker, grey air in a shape that suggests *bird* in my mind \u2013 I\u2019ve come to call them *airbirds*. Its voice carries though the aether in a way that even an untrained mind can interpret. \n\n\u201cNot a stranger. A friend. Are there none who tell of our first meeting now?\u201d\n\nThe airbird zips into its cave. When it returns seconds later, it is accompanied by several more gray shapes. Even more of the beings flutter out of caves in the background. Tiny wisps raise the hairs on my arms as some beings take flight toward me, whipping around me in curious exploration.\n\n\u201cHuman?\u201d The question comes from many voices echoing in the back of my mind.\n\n\u201cYes, I am human. I told you once \u2013 I am from a realm with no aether.\u201d\n\n\u201cAncestor story. Many generations.\u201d\n\nI nodded. This is the difficulty in speaking with the creatures. They live only a week at best. I learned aether-weaving over many generations by their reckoning, and had spent even longer preparing to open the way home. \n\n\u201cI will return home. You\u2019ve done so much for me \u2013 are you certain I cannot return the favor?\u201d\n\nThe airbird directly before me flutters, and I understand it is considering the offer.\n\n\u201cMore humans. More friends.\u201d\n\nI smile as I understand. There do not seem to be other beings capable of thought in this realm \u2013 of course the airbirds want to meet other people.\n\n\u201cVery well. Let me see if it is possible.\u201d\n\nI am frightened for a minute. I do not know how I first fell through the opening between realms. I simply awoke in a stony desert, and was forced to search frantically for water. I found no beings in that realm, just endless heat and a sense that I now recognize as the subtle influence of aether in my mind. By pure chance, I stumbled upon a rift in the air, a shimmering portal between realms, and came here to a realm without stone or earth.\n\nWith the airbirds still fluttering around me, I look to the aether again for answers. Part of my mind is still working to keep me afloat as the rest works to understand one final question. I take out my notebook, and once again the answer appears in conjured ink upon a conjured page.\n\n\u201cI think this is an answer,\u201d I say at last. I look at the page as I come out of my communion with the aether. It is a long mathematical equation, the likes of which are far beyond my rudimentary knowledge. \u201cPerhaps your children will see my kind again.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo then. Go peacefully.\u201d\n\nI smile as a tear wells in the corner of my eye. I resolve myself \u2013 as wondrous as this aether is, no such power could equal the company of my own kind. With a final nod to the incredible beings of air, I weave the spell to take me home.\n\n***",

                    "comment": "Dr. Sonja Olson\u2019s personal diary, Amundson-Scott South Pole Station, March 2017\n\nThis Fleming guy is one lucky bastard. He was just out there in the snow, not much on besides his ridiculous white robe. If we found him any later, we\u2019d be chopping off frostbitten extremities. It was right when the aurora was brighter than I\u2019ve ever seen it, there was this crackling noise. I swear I saw a shimmering portal \u2013 it was a glowing violet oval just floating in the air. It was gone quickly though. I don\u2019t think anyone else was looking the right way when the man fell out of it.\n\nI carried him in, and Brett treated him in the clinic. I stayed with the man, and he told me the craziest story. Other realms? Worlds beyond ours? It all sounds like bullshit. His accent and choice of words don\u2019t help \u2013 I swear he sounds like an audition for Great Expectations.\n\nI finally got him to tell me his name, and I thought Google wouldn\u2019t be much help. Too many Brian Flemings out there \u2013 but there was this one hit at the bottom I had to check out. A failed expedition to the South Pole, a few years before Amundson got here. A Brian Fleming from London was part of that, but his body was never found. The survivors of his expedition reported that he had vanished through \u201ca rift in the air\u201d. Holy shit, right? Maybe I\u2019m not totally batshit.\n\nIt gets better. I looked through the notebook \u2013 he was clutching the thing like his life depended on it, but I finally got a hold of it when he fell asleep. It talks about *aether* and how to use it \u2013 I couldn\u2019t make any sense out of that, but there was this equation after all the mumble jumble. Sweet Jesus, someone call Stephen Hawking \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure this is an actual, meaningful equation in here. I\u2019ll get on Skype once it's morning in Geneva \u2013 I think Dr. Henderson at the LHC might know something about this equation. It looks like something from his quantum mechanics research. He\u2019s always going on about \u201cmany worlds\u201d \u2013 maybe there\u2019s something more than theoretical to it.\n\nI\u2019ll watch Fleming a bit longer before I turn in. What if he is the same guy? He spent over a century in some other realm? I guess we can\u2019t know how time passes in other realities. God, I must be tired. I\u2019m starting to take this seriously.\n\nThere was something else Fleming said. Right before he fell asleep, he was staring at a computer monitor close to his bed. He said something like, \u201cThere may be no aether in this realm, but perhaps we weave our own sort of magic.\u201d",

He was so thirsty...\n\n\"Abracadabra give me some water!\" He chanted. At once a nice fresh glass of water appeared in his hand. He gulped it down greedily and then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand then lay back down satisfied and warm and happy.

            "comment": "I decided to describe the *other* worlds, and how I think they're like.\n\n* **Earth:** With the very rock we stand on as we know it gone, life is basically in space, and uses magical gravity-changing spells to keep everything together (remember, they have magic at their disposal.) Controlled projection or hallucination spells are made to give the illusion of a solid object, even though it's just that, and only bound by gravitation spells. Zero-gravity is considered the ultimate hazard; it could be the easiest way to be lost forever.\n* **Water:** Without a basic all-in-one liquid, the oceans are instead a cesspool of liquids, and various parts have different liquids. Natural, yet still unorthodox liquids such as milk compromise the ocean, rain, and plants even evolve to specifically be lactose tolerant, as well as tolerant to other liquids. Soda oceans result from carbonation of some oceans, normally with disastrous results, though plenty of people find the resulting water delicious... if purified, that is. If you go to the equator, you may just see the rare LAVA ocean. Use your fortified boats and heat-proof gear, though, for when you go through them.\n* **Air:** With no air to breathe, humanity and life as we know it has evolved to use gills, and use the water as their source of oxygen. The furthest it's gotten is amphibians, which is what humans are in this sort of life, but they do all eventually need to retreat to water. Given the risks of air, a lot of people choose to live underwater, or at the very least in marshy areas. Waterproof technology isn't optional; it's *mandatory* for most.\n* **Fire:** With nothing else to \"heat\", electricity seems the best step, as it gives similar sensations. In this world, electronics developed far quicker, the industry developed almost instantaneously, and the world is very sci-fi.\n* **Magic:** ...Um, Hi? You're already here.",

            "comment": "The Girl awoke in a different place, just like the Witch had, many years earlier. But while the Girl came from the magicless world, Kan-Sas, the Witch had come from the waterless place, what the locals called The Deadly Deserts. \n\nNow, of course, both were in Oz, the fireless. Yes, the Wizard had brought fire from Kan-Sas, and done his best to replicate it, but his substitute was nothing like Kan-Sas or The Deadly Deserts had. And, of course, the Witch was rapidly creating her own fire substitute, threatening all of Oz. And, as a member of The Five, a secret group, with one member from each universe, it was truly in the Good Witch's best interest to keep both the Witch and The Wizard from getting any closer to fire.\n\nThat's where the Girl, Dorothy, came in. The Witch, Elphaba, would be the easy part. When water so much as touched Desertians, they died. The Good Witch, Glinda, wasn't sure of the physics of it, but she knew it was true. Just get the Girl to throw some water on poor Elphie, and that was that. Of course, Glinda couldn't be present for that, it would hurt her so to see her old friend murdered.\n\nThe Wizard would be the challenge. Once a member of The Five, he had gone rogue, learning to control magic as well as his four elements. Practically invulnerable. The only way Glinda could think of was to get him back to his own universe. And she could use the girl as an excuse for him to need to leave! Brilliant! The plan was coming together.\n\nGlinda hopped into her bubble and smiled. She was ready to go save Oz.",

            "comment": "Mage Fire\n\nDr. Park climbed out from the exposed roots of the tree. The path through the roots had been dark and he didn\u2019t trust electronics on this trip so he walked by the light of a lantern. Just like back at home the massive roots bisected a cave system which seemed odd to Dr. Park since that meant the roots where growing through rock deep into the ground. \n\nHe held his gloved hand to the wall and started walking, it was a trick he learned from one of the spelunkers when they were initially exploring the caves. He sighed, it would be nice to have one of the guys with him now, but that couldn\u2019t happen since the sorcerer closed off the cave entrance home.\n\nDavid focus, I need to get out of this cave, no use dwelling on the past. Dr. Park took a deep breath and kept walking. Ugh, I wish I had my phone, at least I could listen to some music to pass the time.\n\nThe cave was smaller than he expected and it opened up into a normal looking forest. He had been searching for what made this world unique since the other two worlds they had visited had been unusual. Nothing stood out until he had exited the forest onto some farmland.\n\nNow he could see the setting sun clearly and for whatever reason it was decidedly purple. I\u2019ll have to keep an eye out tomorrow, maybe it\u2019s just the light interacting with something in the atmosphere.\n\nHe sat down and finished the last of his rations, hopefully the farmland meant that there would be a barn nearby he could crash in for the night. He didn\u2019t want to spend the night outside in a strange world. Well no time to waste. He got back up and relit his lantern now that it was twilight.\n\nHe was right! There was a barn! Adjacent to it was a farmhouse. There where blue white flickering lights inside which struck Dr. Park as unusual. He wasn\u2019t that far when he heard yelling. \n\nThe back door to the farmhouse slammed open and a number of large men dragged a man, a woman, and two children all gagged and bound into the barn. He could hear their muffled cries.\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Dr. Park said under his breath as he stopped in his tracks. I should avoid that, but I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I didn\u2019t try to save them. He mulled over that thought for a moment. There\u2019s nothing I can do, I am perfectly justified in not getting myself involved. No one even has to know that\u2026\n\nA scream from the barn pierced his thought. Dr. Park let out a defeated sigh. \u201cI\u2019m going to die here,\u201d he said.\n\nHe ran to the barn hoping he wasn\u2019t too late. The thugs had left the door open and Dr. Park took a peek inside. Four posts had been planted, each with someone bound to it. There were five men, four thugs and a well dressed man. The well dressed man was addressing the man who Dr. Park assumed was the father. He couldn\u2019t understand the language but when the well dressed man rubbed his thumb against his first two fingers the message seemed to be clear.\n\nAn order was barked and a thug dumped a pile of hay at the base of the posts. Another thug held a lit torch. There it was! The aberration! If this world fit the pattern of the others then that meant this world lacked fire! They used magic to fill in that gap! Ok David, save farmers, don\u2019t die, get a sample of mage fire, move on. I can do this!\n\nThe thug with the torch tossed it into the hay. David froze. It was too late, it was a bad idea to come here, what was he thinking? The mage fire stayed attached to the torch and didn\u2019t spread. David\u2019s brow furrowed as he tilted his head. That\u2019s not right.\n\nThe thug showed his palm to the torch and spoke one word. The mage fire spread to the hay. The farm family cried out and struggled in vain with their bonds. The fire crackled and raced up the posts and onto clothes.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d David cried reflexively reaching out.\n\nThe air distorted and the mage fire blew out.\n\nDavid, stunned, didn\u2019t move as he tried to process what had just happened.\n\nThe thugs turned towards David. He didn\u2019t remember what happened next, all he knew was he panicked and smashed his lantern onto the thug that attacked him first. He sat on the ground watching as orange flame covered the screaming thug who ran around like a cat chasing a laser.\n\nRolling on the ground didn\u2019t seem to occur to the thug who opted to jump into a nearby cart full of hay. What? Is this guy an idiot?\n\nThe well dressed man had been watching this too and for a moment there eyes met. The well dressed man barked some orders crying out \u201cMagi, Magi!\u201d and then they were gone. The thugs just left. Their partner unmoving in the cart and still on fire.\n\nBesides the crackling of the fire and the night breeze it was quiet. Then the farmers started making noise again. David\u2019s mind started back up, he got off the ground and unbound the family. He had no idea what they were saying but from their tone gratitude seemed to be the message.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Dr. Park said.\n\nOne of the children, a teenager, pointed over to the fire, \u201cWosh!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s fire. Here let me show you,\u201d he said. He grabbed the flint and steel from his bag and some hay. He struck some nice sparks starting a small fire. They all looked amazed. The youngest reached out to touch it but David loudly objected. Startled she jerked her hand back but not before the air distorted and the fire blew out. David raised his eyebrows, he would have to remember that.\n\nThe father pulled out his own flint and steel, and gathered his own hay pile. Dr. Park noticed the sparks where that same blue white color of the mage fire. Indeed the hay lit into mage fire. The father promptly stuck his hand in. He picked up the hay and handed it to David who tentatively accepted it. It was warm, gave off plenty of light and didn\u2019t burn him or the hay. It stayed on the hay as he tossed it between hands. \n\nThey spent the next hour teaching each other about fire and magic, well as well as they could without speaking. The father was more than happy to trade flint and steel with David, especially after he helped them put out the thug and bury him. He stayed the night in the barn and before he left they said some goodbyes. The mother gave him some food, water, and a new lamp to take with him. \n\nThe trip back through the woods was shorter now that he was more confidant of the way and there was proper sunlight to guide him. While it was just as bad here to look directly at the sun David could tell it was a blue white color.\n\nOk, I have mage fire now, good. Just need to get the magic of the other three worlds and I\u2019ll be ready I think. He retraced his steps through the cave and back into the tunnel made out of the huge roots.\n\n___\n\nThe Idea I had was too grand so I tryed to keep it down to something smaller.",

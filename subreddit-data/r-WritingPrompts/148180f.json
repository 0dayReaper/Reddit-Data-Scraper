            "comment": "This reminds me of a story about an absolute mountain of a man that I knew while I was growing up in Montana. His name was Kirby. His ex-wife went nuts one night while he was sleeping and shot him 6 times in the forehead at point blank range with a .38. A while later(not sure of the timeline, again I was fairly young) while she was getting things together to go on the run, he came walking into the room rubbing his head, asking for some Tylenol for the killer migraine he had. She went catatonic at the sight. He wound up with a plate in his head due to a fractured skull and a glass eye from a piece of one of the bullets destroying his natural one. Nicest guy you would ever meet, I always heard she was just mean as they come though.",

            "comment": "\"Because you are following me for the last 5 CENTURIES!!\" I bellow at my companion, who seemed surprisingly alive for someone with a bullet hole in his forehead almost 12 hours ago.\n\n\"Yes and? We have known each other for all that time and yet this was the first time you actually used a weapon to try to kill me, usualy you used poison, or try to drown me or bodge my car's brake lines. That one time you put me in a vat of acid was fun tho, it prickled nicely.\" he retorted calmly, almost amused sounding.\n\nDuring this short exchange, I was on my knees cleaning the bloodstains from the floor, annoyed I looked up at him and through my teeth mumbled: \"And you 'accidentally' ate my pet turtle, lost the deed to my HOUSE, caused a violent revolution in a country I was having a vacation in, catfished me because 'it would be funny... should I go on?' \"I directed an angry stare at him. He was the spitting image of what you would call an androgynous beauty, and he chuckled as he replied \"You HAVE to admit, the catfishing was funny.\"\n\nI awkwardly look away and simply say \"Yes it kinda was.\"\n\n\"Anyway, that doesn't explain why you shot me this time tho?\" he says in a demanding tone.\nBecause of his attitude, I sometimes forget myself, but he IS a Deity, not from any known pantheon but still very much able to alter reality. And I am stuck with him and this eternal life for the last 500 Years because he lost a game of Chess against me. I didn't even know the rules, I just randomly moved pieces around and somehow I not only didn't violate any rules... I even won. And as a reward, I was granted eternal life and his never-ending companionship. \"Reward? More like divine punishment\"\n\nThe 'Deity', who in the meantime started cleaning as well, looked up and tilted his head slightly \"You said anything\"\n\n\"nothing of importance. To answer your question, I shot you because you committed the one thing I just can't stand, you bought a Trumpet and played it at 5 am... AGAIN. Once I can forgive as we had a talk after that... twice is unforgivable. You can't even play the instrument, it sounds like a dying animal\"",

            "comment": "The clinic just appeared one day. People couldn\u2019t really say when. The elderly residence of Chinatown would just shake their heads when asked. It\u2019s been there forever, they would say. The proprietor\u2019s been there forever too, they would say. \n\nA young man, frail looking and a bit on the short side. Liked to dress up in traditional clothing, claiming it was to advertise his business of selling traditional medicine. He looked surprised when we came to his shop, asking for protection money. As if nobody had ever asked him to pay up before. \n\nI felt a chill down my spine when he looked at me. It was his first time anyway, so I just left, saying I\u2019d given him a warning and that we wouldn\u2019t be so polite next time. \n\nHe didn\u2019t pay up. A week later, I sent a few of my guys down to check things out. They didn\u2019t come back. \n\nThings got weird from there. People would go missing whenever they went off on their own into alleys or at night. We\u2019d never find a trace of them. I realized after a while that we were fighting against an invisible enemy, and then when I thought about how this all started\u2026 \n\nI didn\u2019t go back alone, I swear. I brought all the boys in the area with me, armed to the teeth with every piece of hot metal we could get our hands on. It was overkill, or at least that\u2019s what I thought at the time. \n\nI took the first shot myself. The doorbell of the shop tinkled as I stepped inside, raising my shotgun. Point blank, I couldn\u2019t miss. The proprietor looked up at me from the counter. His eyes weren\u2019t afraid\u2026more annoyed than anything, although I didn\u2019t see his expression for much longer when I pulled the trigger. \n\nHis body staggered in place. It didn\u2019t fall. His hand came up to massage the place where his temple used to be and there was a sigh as his flesh squirmed and grew back. Wooden tendrils erupted from the wooden floorboards, grabbing and twisting at everything. I think I was screaming. I don\u2019t remember much other than using up my entire cartridge. \n\nBoss, you must be wondering how I got out of this situation right? Well, it\u2019s simple. \n\nI didn\u2019t. \n\nThe roots are squirming inside my skin. I\u2019m just a puppet now you see, after he got to me. I\u2019m supposed to come here and distract you while he seals off the exits. \n\nHe\u2019s coming. Don\u2019t bother running.\n\nYou\u2019ll regret it just as much as I did, soon enough.",

            "comment": "\n\u201cHey so, why\u2019d you shoot me in the head last night. Kinda stung.\u201d I blinked twice as my roommate came out of his bedroom, blood still soaking his collar. Hypothesis confirmed. I was living with a vampire.\n\nI smiled at him and set my phone down beside me. \u201cWell, I had an interesting theory that you wouldn\u2019t die. And you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI could tell Derrick was going to spin this is into a big deal. He started tapping his foot and his eyes started to glow. \u201cEm.. you shot me? How would you know I wouldn\u2019t die?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell as I-\u201c\n\nHe interrupted with a wave of his hand. \u201cBut how would you know?\u201d He started to pace in his familiar circle. \u201cWere you really willing to kill me? Emerson, you were willing to murder for a silly hypothesis?!?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it before.\u201d The statement slipped unbidden from my lips. Derrick turned his fiery gaze on me.\n\n\u201cYou what!?\u201d He loomed in front of me, perhaps trying to intimidate me. He needn\u2019t have tried. I feared him already. I just knew that showing the weakness could prove fatal.\n\nI shrugged uncomfortably. That was one hypothesis I\u2019d been displeased with. He hadn\u2019t been immortal, just a rapist. And as such, the bullet to the brain was still a pleasing end to an otherwise unsatisfactory and unsavory, disappointingly human being. \u201cAnyway. The point is, I was reasonably certain. And I was correct. So why whine about what could\u2019ve happened? It didn\u2019t. Chill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s another thing.\u201d He plunked down next to me and sulked.. menacingly. \u201cHow did you know? You\u2019re oblivious.\u201d\n\nI smiled and folded my fingers together. \u201cSo glad you asked. The girls leaving your room with little pinpricks on their necks were a big clue. They were what made me watch for the little things, like choosing the seat farthest away from the sun. All those compounded to a pretty solid base. And then last night, you were drunk and nuzzled my neck, licking it, I might add. It was either a disgusting show of affection, or you were really hungry. Then I placed my bets and rolled the dice.\u201d As I talked, Derrick slumped back against the couch, crossing his arms.\n\nFinally he said, \u201cI.. so how many of our friends know?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d My smile grew. \u201cI\u2019ve been covering for you for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d A relieved grin broke out on his face. \u201cSo.. you\u2019re cool with this..?\u201d\n\nHe was waiting for me to say the word. I didn\u2019t. \u201cArrangement? Yeah.\u201d I chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m just really relieved I was right. Disposing of bodies isn\u2019t my favorite way to spend a Saturday.\u201d\n\nDerrick elbowed me, though a hint of nervousness still showed on his face. \u201cJerk.\u201d",

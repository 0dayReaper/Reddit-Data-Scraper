    "postText": "Six months ago, I answered a prompt where superpowers are determined by birth location and the first person had just been born in space.  Now it's a finished novel!\n\nHere is the original prompt from user /u/mdmarshmallow\n\n**[Superpowers are based on the topography of where someone is born (IE: Mountains, deserts, etc.). The first person has just been born in space.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/65f88x/wp_everyone_has_a_superpower_based_on_the/)**\n\nNow, after six months, 95 chapters, and over 90k words, that response became a full novel!  A huge thanks go out to the redditors that helped me arrive at this point through their support, critiques, and kind words. [Kindle copies available for only $2.99](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Child-Places-Leonard-Petracci-ebook/dp/B076PGG2XK), which can be read on phone, computer, or tablets!  \n\n**Here is chapter 1, which was the original response that spurred everything forwards**\n\nIt was an accident, of course.\n\nMy birth, my being in space, and well, I suppose I was an accident as well. An accident from the director of engineering screwing the fat janitor after hours when the rest of the shuttle team had retired; the odds that my mother had been able to hide her baby bump for nine months, the chances that she had been a nurse before being selected from the program and knew how to give birth herself, in a maintenance closet, mere days before the mission was to return to earth. Keeping me hidden was difficult in the small confines of the ship, but the other hundred and fifty crew members had been too busy to pay a mere maid much attention. After all, many insisted that it had not been worthwhile to bring her along, that a maid had been a waste of tax dollars. I suppose that makes me a waste of tax dollars as well.\n\nBut there were those that spoke to her unique abilities as a maid. For she had been born deep in the snow of the north, during the first blizzard of winter, that like the first snowfall, she could smooth over any differences in her environment and make it appear uniform. As a maid, it meant that she had an extraordinary sense of cleanliness. As a mother, it meant she could ensure I was overlooked, that my crying was muffled, and later in life, that I appeared no different from anyone else.\n\nStar Child, she had called me as she smuggled me back into the atmosphere, tucked deep in her suit like a kangaroo would carry her young. Star Child, she whispered to me when the project disbanded, and she took me to the inner city apartment where I spent my early life. Star Child, she reprimanded whenever I started pushing and pulling at the equilibrium of our apartment, when she would arrive home from work and all the furniture would be clustered at the center of the room, pulled together by a force point.\n\n\u201cWhen will I go to school?\u201d I asked her when I was eight, watching the uniformed children marching up the street through the wrought-iron gates of the academy, one of them flicking flames across his fingers like a coin while another left footprints of frost in the grass.\n\n\u201cYou already go to school, Star Child,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd your teachers say you've been learning your numbers well, and your reading has been progressing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot *that* school,\u201d I had said, pulling a face. \u201cI want to go to the academy. The special school, for the others like me!\u201d I held up a fist, and items on the desk in front of me flew towards it, pens and papers and pencils that stuck out like quivering quills out of my skin.\n\n\u201cStar Child, listen and stop that at once,\u201d she said, her eyes level with mine. \u201cThere *are* no others like you. Those children; they are all classified, they are all known. You are *not* like them, you never will be. And they can't know, do you understand me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d I answered with a huff, watching as one of the children cracked a joke and the others laughed. \u201cBut I don't like my school. Everyone there knows we can't be like them, that we can't be special.\u201d\n\n\u201cStar Child, you *are* special. One day, they'll know that too. But not now \u2013 if they knew, they wouldn't take you to the academy. They'd take you somewhere else, somewhere terrible.\u201d\n\nAnd as I grew older, I realized that she was right. That when our neighbor started developing powers, a police squad showed up at her front door and classified her on the spot. That they left her with a tattoo on her shoulder, a tattoo of a lightning bolt, symbolizing the storm during which she had been born. Just like the tattoo of a snowflake on my mother's shoulder, colored dull grey, to indicate a low threat potential.\n\nSo instead of going to the academy, I created an academy of my own, in my room. Mother made me turn the lights out at ten, so during the day, I collected light outside, keeping it in one of the dark holes I could create when I closed my fist hard enough, and letting it loose at night to read books I had stolen from the library. From the section for the special children, that I could only access if the librarians were distracted.\n\nBut distractions came easy to me.\n\nAs I grew older, the city streets became more populated with the blue uniforms of police. The academy became increasingly harder to attend, and the gifted girl next door disappeared one night without a note. Mother stopped letting me outside after dark, and the lines for the soup kitchens grew longer. The skies grew darker, the voices accustomed to speaking in whispers, and the television news seemingly had less and less to report. It was as if there was a blanket thrown upon us, but no one dared look to see who had thrown it.\n\nBut I would. And when I did, I realized the earth needed a Star Child.\n\n***\n[For only $2.99, you can have your own kindle copy by clicking here!](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Child-Places-Leonard-Petracci-ebook/dp/B076PGG2XK)\n***\n[90% of this book is already free online on my subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/65jl9n/star_child_part_1/), but the chapters are not all edited and still in the process of being posted.

Except to go into space, every gram of mass counts, so why would they send an entire person into space just to keep it clean? Why someone who was fat? How does a person go from career nurse to space janitor/maid? It's hard to get into space-- how does someone like that make the cut?). \n\n\"Janitor\" also typically conjures an image of a male, vs \"maid\" which conjures an image of a female, so I can see why people were confused on the gender front.\n\nI think the sentence structure could be rearranged so that it's less confusing. As for why/how, I guess that's probably not important to the actual story.",

            "comment": "Just as Donald was about to press the button that would trigger the bomb - the bomb that would level the FCC headquarters - he heard a voice.  \n\nNamed for Donald Trump the First, Inaugurator of the Great American Monopoly, Donald had never heard English spoken with an accent anything like the one the voice carried:\n\n\"I'm gunna needya to put that trigga down mate.\"\n\nThere was a distinct menace in the tone, and a confidence of someone who is usually obeyed.\n\nDonald hesitated, wondering if this was one of those illegal aliens people talked about from the time before the walls. People always said aliens talked funny, but few people in 2038 had heard one.\n\n\"I dinnea think he underrrstood ye\" a second voice muttered, before a third voice exclaimed \"Be a good chap and place the trigger on the bed. We won't kill you unless you refuse.\"\n\nDonald whirled around, expecting to see little grey men, or green sludge monsters. The sight that greeted him was significantly more perplexing. Three men, well dressed, well armed (at least Donald assumed the things they were pointing were weapons) and one of them carried something that Donald had never seen before - a smallish rectangular object which had moving pictures on the top face - the person holding it was jabbing at it and running his fingers across the images.\n\nThe first voice spoke again - coming from the closest man, who waved his 'gun' to get Donald's attention. \"For the last time, put down tha bloomin' trigga!\" \n\nAs Donald slowly complied, he objected as non-threateningly as he could - \"You don't know what you're doing! I've travelled here from 2038! Time travel - real genuine time travel! And do you know why? It's to stop the repeal of Net Neutrality!\" A touch of desperation crept intonhia tone as he inched his had back toward the trigger mechanism.\n\n\"Aye laddie! We ken why you're here. We just can't let you do it!\"\n\n\"But why?\" Donald wailed \"the internet is useless when you have to go through a paywall for each leg of every journey your data packets have to go through! Did you know that the top course at every major university is the state sponsored \"Bachelor or Trumpian Communication Systems?\" Any search that needs to be completed in under a week requires an advanced degree specialist!\"\n\n\"Well here's the thing old chap\" - voice number three again. \"You see, we come from 2038 as well. We represent the combined interests of the post industrial economies of our time, which is the rest of the world, give or take.\" \n\nVoice number 1 \"As much as we admire the effort you and your little cadre of freedom fighters put in to get you here, there are many things you don't understand. 30 November is celebrated all around the world as the day the internet was set free!\"\n\nDonald's mouth hung open in disbelief. 30 November was when it happened. When the arch nemeses of all free flowing communication forever plunged the light of the internet into the deepest darkest pit in the lowest circle of hell. Only freedom fighters as.dedicsted as Donald had a chance of fixing it! \n\nAs Donald tried to explain, voice number one cut in again - \"Nah mate! You've got it all wrong. Net Neutrality was never even a discussion outside of the USA. The day the FCC killed Net Neutrality in the US, dozens of countries around the world designated internet access an essential service, forever protecting the free flow of information.\"\n\nVoice number 3 - \"He's quite right you know Donald. It took about two weeks for all of the major tech companies to really understand. Then one by one, they reconfigured their offshore disaster recovery solutions to become primary services, and moved operations to any of the countries waiting with open arms to welcome them. Amazon is based in Monaco now, Netflix moved to Scandinavia, Google went truly global and has a presence in every major city, \n\nSince no content could get oit of the States, media companies from around the world stepped up, globalised their offering and shut down connections to USA.  Even primary DNS services move put of the USA. \n\n\"So no - you won't be killing Ajit today. Go home. When you get there, try to defect - swim 1 mile straight out to sea from this location and well pick you up in person. No one should have accept sub-standard internet.",

How the memes ran free, without restraint, without obstacle. \nI didn't know what had happened to this internet back then. I was too young to understand the ways things were now. \n\nBut as I grew older, my mother began to tell me new stories. \n\nShe told me how the beautiful internet she had once called home came under attack. \n\nWith sadness in her eyes, she recounted the doomed fight the denizens of the internet waged. She told of how her people fought against the forces that threatened the very essence of their home, net neutrality. \nI listened, eyes wide, as she reminisced about the days when the feed was clogged with red boxes, and how the dwellers of every corner of the internet came out and fought for their homeland. \n\nThey fought with the facts, and with outrage, and ----E pitchforks, and memes. They fought valiantly, with courage and honor.\n\nBut in the end, they couldn't save the internet. Net neutrality became nothing but a distant memory, and the internet she had loved was gone. Slowly but surely, all that which made the internet beautiful was stripped away until there was nothing left. The heroes failed, and darkness prevailed. \n\nToday, the internet is but a shell of its former self, and we live in despair. There are no more cat videos, no gifs. All memes are dead memes. The world is cold, and all that is left for us humans is to suffer in the dark.\n\nAt least, that's what I thought. But then, I learned that there were still some people fighting, even today, when the internet as it used to be is but a distant dream.\nThe rebels know there is no hope of saving the internet now. They can't bring something back from the dead. But what if we could go back in time, with the knowledge of what happened in the past, to save the internet from ruin before it was already gone? \n\nMany years have passed since that cursed year, 2017. Enough time that we now have the technology to go back to that time when the internet had not yet died.\n\nNow, I am part of the small, elite group of rebels that is travelling back to that year. We know that the people responsible for killing the internet have caught wind of what we are doing, that our time is nearly up, that this mission is our best and only chance to save that which our parents loved, and cried for.\n\nI swear to myself, to my mother, and to all those who still hold onto hope, that we will save the internet. We will not fail.",

By 2038 the charge for \"unlimited access\" with Pentagon level upload and download speeds was about $40,000/month per user, which was great, but there's no fun to be had in a empty theme park as quiet as a graveyard. \n\nWith the help of Russian and China, President Donald Trump successfully destroyed and conquered North Korea, all without a single nuke going off. Under the cover of war the 22nd Amendment was abolished and Trump repeatedly won re-election. Surprisingly enough, similar to how we stole rocket technology from the Nazi's in WWII, we had recruited and stolen technology from the North Koreans who had expanded the average human life by 200 years. President Trump, now borderline immortal won again and again, with \"no-collusion\" in every win. \n\nBut who could protest? Any protest assembled online would be immediately shut down for violation of \"Terms and Conditions\" clauses that you had to agree with even just to watch other people browse the internet (yes this was a thing, pushed the Twitch streaming service to open at the NYSE at $69.00/share).\n\nProtests in person were unorganized and were never able to gain traction as the rewards for stopping them were too good. Anyone with evidence of a protestor's identity was rewarded with 1 TV Shows bandwidth of streaming. Ironically Twitter was free, and anyone who tweeted in support of the President or against the \"Fake News Media\" was rewarded with credits that they could spend on other sites, a vicious never ending cycle of lies and propaganda, but if it meant free Netflix? Fuck it. \n\nAll resistances needed to be financed and I was a key player in making this happen. We had underground cells of about 100 people in the major cities, a total of 324 people all together. Candidates were selected based on their internet activity (and how dank their memes were) back when it was free, easily accessible through a few thousand dollars in bribes. \n\nSix years. Six fucking years is how long it took us to build this time machine. All we needed was the perfect candidate to go back in time. \nSomeone who could directly influence the politics.

            "comment": "November, 2017. A month right before everything went wrong. It all started out with that repeal of net neutrality. Almost immediately, the ISP's began to go back on their promises that they wouldn't limit access for customers. Within a few months, the ISP's managed to stratify the internet by wealth. Internet culture came to a screeching halt in early 2018 as numerous websites deemed as \"high bandwidth content\" began to go bland and die due to severe restrictions on their access by the general public. There was outrage, of course, but like with many things, the fury died down, and people accepted that this is the way the world was. Slowly but surely, more and more websites began to disappear from the web as their content became more and more restricted. The ISP's became all the more powerful, as they aggressively tried to buy out platforms like Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, and other social media to further advance their profit margins. The websites that resisted the buyouts were strangled to death with access restrictions. By the time Trump was impeached for the 9th and final time, the damage his negligence caused was irreversible. The ISP's had become all powerful. All information passed through them, and secretly, they were in the process of merging behind the scenes into one massive conglomerate ISP. When the federal government tried to break them up, the conglomerate ISP, eventually known as The Provider, shut down all government services. It was chaos. Since the Provider controlled the flow of all information, it was easy to paint the situation as a failure of governance. The Provider was more than happy to take the mantle as the New Government of the United States.\n\nThe year is now 2038. If George Orwell could see the world we are living in, he would die of terror. Three years ago, the Provider mandated that all people have a chip installed in their brains. They were sold as a \"virtualized access chips\", but that was only on the surface. These were Death Chips. These chips knew the account balance of the people they were implanted in, and if that balance did not qualify for certain levels for information access on the Net, then higher brain function was reduced. These chips literally reduced the thinking capacity of those with low account balances, so much so to create a slave race of drone workers. If an unhappy soul reaches 0, well... brain death.\n\nA few of us escaped the implementation of the chips. For three years, we have been living off the grid in the wastes of Montana, fighting back against the Provider, although never with resounding success. That was until a couple weeks ago. A crazed old man who claims to be a scientists came to us about a year ago with this insane idea about time travel. He said he used to work for the Provider, in their research and development department. When he realized they were entrusting him to create a time machine for the purpose of rewritting history to suit their diabolical needs, he took all their research, and fled, making sure to purge all information relating to the project. We all thought he was crazy, but now it seems he was right. As we prepare to send our first agents back in time to sabatage the ISP's before they sprout their evil, I try to think of a world where digital information is free flowing and equal. As I step into 2017 to fulfill my assigned mission, I shed a single tear seeing how free and open the internet is. It must be protected. At all cost.",

            "comment": "It's January 19th, 2038. For years, Susan had been working in secret on her time machine. Her goal? Not to kill Hitler. Not to stop Trump. Not to meet Jesus. Her goal is to make it so she can watch Netflix and download games on Steam without having to pay an extra premium. A noble, but petty goal, all things considered. \n\nShe sets the time circuits to November 23rd, 2017. She sees this as the pivotal turning point -- Thanksgiving Day. The day that everyone in the United States is at home with their families, and most likely watching Football or the Macy's parade. When it will be easiest to get their attention. \n\nShe thinks she has it all figured out. She's tested the machine a few times before to go backwards days and even weeks. This will be her biggest jump. Ironically, much like the original Delorean in Back to the Future her ship is fueled by raw plutonium. Also, ironically, thanks to the Trump regime (which has been in power for 20 years thanks to a military coup) she lives in a Libertarian utopia (by which I mean a dystopia) and you can buy plutonium at the corner drug store, just as Doc Brown joked about in Back to the Future. Anyway, enough about how great of a movie Back to the Future is.\n\nThe amount of plutonium it depletes is based on how far into the past she travels. She's figured out the exact ratio needed for 2017. In order to be safe and not run out, she's purchased ten times the required amount. She has no plans of getting stranded like in some dumb TV show or movie.\n\nBut she's made one specific error. One that would not have exposed itself until this very day, this very hour, this very minute, this very second. Somewhere in the hardware of her time machine, between the interface of the time circuits and the hardware that actually does the quantum calculation on how much fuel to use to bend time and space, there's a chip that takes a 64 bit integer and converts it to a 32 bit one if that number can losslessly be converted. This is an undocumented feature of the chip used to help it do calculations faster. An optimization created by a machine learning algorithm that creates most modern chips of her day.\n\nThe impact of this bug is that her time machine is unknowingly affected by the Unix Epoch Bug. As the machine is warming up, the clock ticks over to 03:14:07 UTC. Instead of the time calculation being for -17 years, 1 month, 27 days, from January 19th, 2038, it gets calculated as -17 years, 1 month, 27 days from December 13th, 1901, also known as October 27th, 1884. And because she took ten times the required fuel, which would have enabled her to do ~200 years worth of time travel, the machine happily consumes 3/4 of her fuel to send her 154 years back in time, stranding her with only enough fuel to make it less than a third of the way back home.\n\nAs the machine hums to life, nothing seems out of the ordinary to Susan. She's transferred all her data to a 20-year-old laptop so she'll be able to interface with older computers easily. She's brought what she hopes will be enough information to prove to people that not only is she from the future, but that net neutrality is the number one issue that people should be concerned about for the future. More important that global warming, ISIS, North Korea, the 2025 war with Russia, any of that. If only they'd had consistent download speeds, all of that could have been avoided and all those problems solved!\n\nAlso at this time I'd like to point out that 21 years (2038 to 2017) is greater than two decades, not \"almost two decades.\" Anyway, I digress.\n\nA flash and a sudden jolt later, and Susan is in 1884. She'd picked the location of her time jump knowing that it would be an empty field in 2017. But in 1884 it was a dense forest. It had not yet been cleared for a cow pasture. There was no Google Street View for her to reference that far back to confirm. There's a small explosion, several pops, and a burning smell as tree trunks around her burst outward as they're displaced in spacetime by her vehicle. A few seconds later, she hears creaking as the damaged trunks bend and break as the trees awkwardly fall around her. She nervously waits out the unexpected cataclysm, hoping it's over. \"What the fuck?\" she demands, annoyed and frustrated. Then she looks at the time circuits. \"What the fuck. God damn it.\"\n\n*How did this happen?* she thinks to herself. *I took so many precautions. I tested it so many times. So many simulations. How the hell did this happen?* But unfortunately for her, because the chip I mentioned earlier was developed using machine learning, it was essentially a black box in her simulation. Whenever she had tested the chip, the inputs and outputs gave her the values she expected. When she simulated the chip, it was only simulated in terms of its expected inputs and outputs. And she'd never tested it when the current date was after the end of the Unix Epoch. She just hadn't considered it. She never intended to travel to the future, only the past. By 2037, nearly all modern computers and software had long ago been fixed to work around or account for the bug. It just wasn't something people thought about anymore. It seemed like a solved problem.\n\nShe activated the augmented reality system that would allow her to look outside the vehicle quickly without leaving it, in order to assess if anything had been damaged. There were some tree trunks leaning on the vehicle and some dents, but overall it seemed to not have taken too much damage. The noise of her arrival also didn't seem to have attracted any unwanted attention. She checked her fuel gauge: slightly less than a quarter remaining. If she activated the ship now to go forward, she could barely make it to 1930. Not good enough. No one would even know what the internet was at that time!\n\nShe sat and thought for a few more minutes. *What if I did something like, living one year normally, then traveling forward a year using the time machine? How far could I get that way?* 1976. Plus that would take up literally 46 years of her life, and put the time machine at risk of being stolen or breaking in the interim. And people would still barely know what the internet was! *What if I found more fuel? When was plutonium discovered anyway? Could I use an alternative fuel? Uranium maybe?* She opened her laptop and went to her offline copy of Wikipedia. *Good thing I paid my ISP for Wikipedia Premium service in order to quickly download the entire database before embarking on this trip.* she thought to herself. And then immediately admonished herself for thinking that way. *No! Fuck that! That's exactly the bullshit I came back to fight against! Fuck paying a premium just to have Wikipedia move faster than a 56k modem! Great. Now I'm pissed off again.* She vowed to herself that her mission must succeed!\n\n&gt;Plutonium was first produced and isolated on December 14, 1940 by a deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. First neptunium-238 (half-life 2.1 days) was synthesized which subsequently beta-decayed to form this new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 87.7 years). Since uranium had been named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet Neptune, element 94 was named after Pluto, which at the time was considered to be a planet as well.\n\n*Those idiots, still considering Pluto a planet. People in the past were so dumb. So, 1940. That's only ten years of my life wasted. I think that's do-able.* Then, hating herself for doing it, she brought up the article on Back to the Future. *1885. And I ended up in 1884. What a stupid coincidence. Well, almost-coincidence. Maybe it's not a coincidence and so much of my work has intersected with that movie because I accidentally leave some information in the past? Nah. It's got to be a coincidence.*\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to make a 2038 Unix Epoch Bug joke.",

            "comment": "I remembered seeing this back now. \n\nI thought I should stop by to 2017 on my way back to bitch-slap Karl Marx, and let you all know that it all ends up okay. All of this protesting gets us nowhere, and they do succeeded in banning net neutrality, but the free market saves us. It always does.  \n\nAround mid 2018, despite all of their promises to the contrary, AT&amp;T and Verizon began capitalising on their duopoly. For a few months the future looked truly bleak as people started going outside and getting exposed to the sun, and other people. Necks were shaved, showers were had, it was horrible. \n\nBut seemingly out of nowhere - although in hindsight we really should have trusted in the wisdom of Ajit Pai - smaller ISP's started popping up all along the east coast. The cynics in us outwardly dismissed them and their dreams for a better world; Didn't they know that the corporations and their evil capitalism were too great an opponent? But secretly we all hoped they would succeed and allow us to return to our slovenly ways.\n\nAnd succeed they did! It wasn't immediately clear how, but over time it was revealed that many of the big content providers had been preparing for just this eventuality. By 2025 Google alone had seeded over 9000 smaller ISP's across the nation. It wasn't fast, and there were many lawsuits, but by time President Trump suffered that fatal aneurysm, we were all safely back in our hovels, bingeing on the latest forgettable rubbish, and spewing our arbitrary opinions into the void.\n\nStill, you are here now, and you can not know that this is other than a fictitious tale. But when the brutal sun is beating down on you as you scurry about in the big outdoors, and you think it's all gone to shit, try to remember: you sometimes need to go through horrible times to truly appreciate the good in the mundane.",

            "comment": "OOC: This is a long one but could be my reaction if this does go through in America and what might happen here. Also this is my first post on here in the Writing Prompts section.\n\nDecember 15, 2017:\nLooking through the channels, I was hoping that the result would be a sounding yes in keeping net neutrality. As a frequent user of the internet, I felt like if there was no net neutrality then the world would collapse. All of the friends that I knew from outside from my local area being easily connectable to friends. From the people on Reddit to a quick check over on the alternate history forums, I could see the people that I knew from the interests that I had.\nSomething though was different for today. As this might be one of the last times that our free will of the internet. I switched over to ABC News to see the breaking news headline that I didn\u2019t want to see in my eyes.\n\nBILL PASSED, NET NEUTRALITY IS REMOVED FROM THE US.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe what happened. This couldn\u2019t be happening right in front of me. The worst case scenario had happened and it was right there in front of my eyes. This had to be a dream as I know for a fact that this only happened in the dark movies. But no, that wasn\u2019t the case and a quick check of social media proved exactly that. Ok, maybe not my Facebook feed, but my twitter feed had blown up with people that I followed also not believing what had happened over in America.\n\nGoing back to our home country, I didn\u2019t like what I was thinking about. If Australia also accepted these laws then that would mean we would be affected and our internet providers (Telstra, Optus, iiNet) could do those exact deals against Australian customers and we as a family is going to be affected.\n\nFor me though, I needed to get away from this reality. A reality that for me did feel right after all of the stuff that has just gone down. Now if my laptop would work, it was time to quickly head over to my FM17 game as at least that won\u2019t be able to be affected by these new laws that are in play. Or I hope it won\u2019t be affected.\n\nDecember 15, 2037: \nAs I got into my car, I ask my car to see what the news of the day was. Thinking that much like any other day, it was probably the same thing that usually did happen.\n\n\u201cHere is the news for December 15, 2037,\u201d the voice said as it showed the news stories coming from the one source.\n\nI quickly looked through the news stories, thinking that nothing would happen all across the world. A quick search though found the headline that I was surprised to see come up on my newsfeed.\n\nUnited States: Net Neutrality \u2013 20 years on\n\nThinking that it was a weird title for a story, I asked to check the article. This opened up the news article, telling that today was the 20th year since the bill past back in 2017. During that time the internet in America as has been limited with the ISPs battling each other to get more money from their customers than their rivals. As I read on, I saw the number of companies that had jumped ship from America over to other parts of the world. From Facebook moving over to the United Kingdom to Rooster Teeth moving to Australia, it not only damaged the American brand but the control of the internet in general.\n\nOf course, I knew that Australia lasted a bit longer than the Americans with free internet speech not being brought up until the following year. Despite the problems though, they passed the bill to remove net neutrality and the population didn\u2019t like it. \n\nFirst, they didn\u2019t legalise same-sex marriage because of religious issues. This was even when most of the population voted for it to be implanted. Then they passed a bill to stop net neutrality and give rights to the ISPs. This basically turns the internet into another round of pay TV. This moment though, made people snap as they didn\u2019t like to lose free access from the internet. From schools to the average person, the internet was officially a way of life. For it to be taken away, meant a loss of freedom.\n\nFor me personally, it made going through TAFE that year tough. This was because most of the course was online. With the new laws though, it now was behind a paywall, that people had to pay to get in. I didn\u2019t want this to be the case, why did have Australia have to follow America with this rule when they could do their own thing.\nProtests and rallies were done all across the country with all of them having one goal. To change the law back to how it was before all of this happened. The positive was that it was working for a short while and we generally thought that it would get it back. We were wrong on that front as the Liberal government weren\u2019t moving from where they stand on the matter.\n\nLabor though was and when the 2019 elections came round, they swiftly defeated the Liberals. The first act was to overturn the ban on free internet access and it was a win for all of who tried to get support. We as a country had done it and had access to the free roam of the internet once again. But that swing of support though didn\u2019t change the minds of the American ISPs as they stuck to their ground and since that day, they have been controlled internet much like the North Korea of the time.\n\nAs I went back to the modern day, I hear a ringtone and answered it, \u201cHello, who is this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is me,\u201d the caller said in a cheerful tone.\n\n\u201cOh hey, Sam, what is the news over there like in Canada? Any anime I am missing out on,\u201d I replied gratefully.\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I called you for, I have called you because I have the invented the time travel machine to go back to 2017 and bring back America,\u201d he gracefully replied.\n\n\u201cWhy are you even trying, America is gone now. Give up on that dream of bringing your southern cousins back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not stand for this, twenty years is too long and it is time to set them free from this mess. I am going to change history hopefully for the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk then, but you won\u2019t be able to go to back to this timeline as that simple event has consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that I have to go now.\u201d\nWith that, he ended the call. I couldn\u2019t believe what he was doing, this didn\u2019t feel like a good idea for him to change history.",

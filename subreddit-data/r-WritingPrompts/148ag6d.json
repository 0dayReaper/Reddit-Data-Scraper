            "comment": "Yes. It knows I can hear it. The voice is rasping and choked, but I can hear it through the door and the walls. Even too clearly. Sometimes I think that it does not travel through soundwaves. I glance at the clock and then steady my grip on the gun; I must resist until the sun rises, but that won't be for a few hours. The pitch black staring at me from the windows seems to have almost physical weight. I regret buying this house in the fields outside the city, yes. \n\n\"Come on. Let me in.\" I do not reply. Why does that thing need me to open the door, anyways? I am quite sure that it could very well rip the damn thing apart if so it wished. Perhaps it is like the vampires of old? Or perhaps it's just taunting me. I am so tired. It has been a week since this whole Hell has started and I have to sleep during the day. I have taken some sick days from work. I am under siege and know it.\n\nKnuckles on wood. I raise my gun, fully aware of how useless it would be. \"Honey, you know how cold it can be outside at this hour.\" It sounds almost annoyed now. \"Don't you wish to kiss your wife? Are you mad at me?\" Back to the taunting. The high-pitched tone is horrible coming from that decaying throat. Does she even have a tongue anymore?\n\n\"You are dead!\" I shout. \"Dead!\"\n\n\"How can you be so sure?\" She is trying to muster a cool, casual fa\u00e7ade, but I can taste the black rage boiling underneath. Does she want me to say it out loud? When I do, it's out of desperation.\n\n\"I killed you\" I say. No, I sob. \"With this very gun.\"\n\n\"Damn right you did!\" What a terrible screech. \"And you didn't even bury me proper!\" The door rattles as she pounds on it. \"I am still decaying in your backyard, you fucker!\" \n\n\"You were going to leave me\" I pant. The weapon in my hand is waving erratically. No. My whole body is shaking.\n\n\"Well, ain't you glad now? I am not leaving you anymore. You can rot with me in Hell, what about that?\" My heart fills with dread as the wooden frame starts splintering and a terrible, rancind smell invades my nose. I squeeze the trigger hoping to stop the horrible carcass that is coming at me, but I don't know how to kill someone who's dead already...",

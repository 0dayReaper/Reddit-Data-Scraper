            "comment": "Blaz plunged his mining pole into the ground, testing the firmness of the soil.\n\nThe farmland in Agno, which was the population center in which he lived on the planet Caritas, was rich and fertile. A farmer could scatter seeds and grow a city of stalks that would sprout within the week; already, Blaz had planted bulbous coepi plants as far as the eye could see. He lifted his mining pole and smiled at the streaks of dirt lining its metal surface. Yes, he would have another good harvest this year. Moving away from the city had been a great idea, even if it originally wasn't his.\n\nThe city was dirty and cramped and odious. Blaz wasn't like others of his kind; he hated tunneling through wet soil on the way to work every day, detested the feel of planet-magma against his claws. He loathed the scratching noises of his coworkers clawing their own way to work, their inane chatter, their pointless goals of filing this paperwork or taking this or that stranger out to dinner and that one to wife. It had, in the end, been a cumulation of all of those little things that had driven him to the mental institution.\n\nBlaz shook his head, recalling his therapist's advice: *Focus on the here and now.* Now, he was living in the surface world, all alone, with no one around to call him crazy. It made him grin in a bizarre hermit kind of way.\n\nHe toiled for the rest of the day and night, only stopping when he was satisfied with the length that his coepi had grown. He looked up at the night sky and smiled, watching the stars sparkle like silver bells. There was the constellation of the Evening Hunter, and there was his Curved Bow. Beneath the three-star trail of his tears (earned in legend by the death of his mother), a new star winked into existence.\n\nBlaz blinked. Living in the city may have driven him a little nuts, but not in a hallucination kind of way. He had never before seen something that wasn't there.\n\nHe went inside and fixed himself a steaming cup of levo. His hands trembled as he took it to his front porch, and saw that the star had grown larger, and gray. It gestated into a shining gray blob, then a kind of machine surrounded by a halo of fire. Blaz cried out; it was huge, and quickly growing gigantic. It could crush him, this thing, whatever it was, and his cup slipped through his fingers to crash broken on the ground. He couldn't look away; his body was refusing to move, accepting the death that awaited it.\n\nSo he waited and watched, relaxing, even allowing himself to notice the beauty of the alien craft as it landed, for that's what it was: an alien craft. And from it scurried three beings in white suits and dark fishbowl helmets, three very large and very broad beings. They approached the front porch, glancing at each other.\n\nBlaz still couldn't move.\n\nThe aliens said something. Their language sounded like singing, like the bubbling of a lavapit. Then they turned to each other, shrugged their shoulders, and walked on.\n\nAnd that was the end of it, really. They never turned back.\n\nHe went into town the next day and found a neighbor to look at his new ship. That neighbor brought in a specialist, who loudly admitted that it did seem to come from another planet, and it was certainly made of materials not indigenous to Caritas. There was a great deal of excitement at this, a flurry of press and reporters and pictures taken.\n\nThen, of course, the government came. They took the ship, and Blaz never saw it again, either. They convinced the press that the pictures that they were taken were of a hoax - the greatest hoax to ever grace the planet, made by a madman with too much time on his hands and a wild imagination. Blaz would be flattered if he weren't being carted back to the Madhouse next week, due to a new Court Order.\n\nOn the last night before his admittance, he sighed and went again to his porch, where he had lately been spending many hours. The night wind blew cold through his fields, so blue, so full of his past life. He would miss this place.\n\nHe sat upon his porch step and put his face in his hands. He let the tears come, and sobbed his heart out through his throat.\n\nBut then--\n\nThrough the crack of his fingers--\n\nA flash of light.\n\nHe looked up, startled. Another ship was floating above him, shining a spotlight down to where he was sitting. A loud, disembodied voice spoke:\n\n*DO NOT BE AFRAID. YOU WILL NOT BE HARMED.*\n\nBlaz found himself floating up, up into the ship, into the light, which he now thought held all of the wonderful and glorious secrets of the universe inside of it, into a vastness unlike anything he had ever known. Inside that light were the beings in the white suits and the fishbowl helmets, and they were poking at him with gloved fingertips.\n\n\"Oh, please, never let me go,\" he babbled to them, wiping at his eyes. \"I don't want to go back, I don't want to live in the madhouse.\"\n\nOne of the beings touched a lever in their suit that peeled back the fishbowl, revealing a horrifying mass of pink flesh that stretched and grinned a terrible grin.\n\n(He's saying something about a madhouse, I think, Captain Tom said to O'Hara.)\n\n(O'Hara laughed. He probably thinks we're his shrink wrapped up in human clothing.)\n\nBlaz heard their unfamiliar words, and did not understand, and screamed. The humans wrapped their hands around his neck and wrung out his life like a wet dishcloth.\n\nWhen it was over, Blaz's neighbors talked to each other of the strange lights they'd seen in the skies. They took pictures of the rings burned into the madman's fields, and tried over and over to convince themselves it was a hoax. Because if it wasn't, well--\n\nWho were the aliens? Where did they come from, and why did they leave?\n\nOnly one thing was for certain: long after the strange marks stayed burned in the black fields of Agno, the madman Blaz was still gone.",

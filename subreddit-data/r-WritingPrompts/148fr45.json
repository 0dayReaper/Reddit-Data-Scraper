            "comment": "\"I--*w-w-what?\"* you finally manage to stammer out through clenched teeth. The burning agony subsides just a hair but, after an hour in a realm of pain, you welcome even this sliver of mercy.\n\n\"YOU. DID NOT. JUJU ON THAT BEAT.\" The looming figure's heavy-lidded eyes blaze in the dark, twin embers that burn hotter with each word he speaks. He shakes his head with a clacking sound; there are beads threaded in his long, thin braids. \"No, that won't do at all,\" he continues in a more normal tone after taking a swig from a dark brown bottle. \"The spell won't work unless you juju on that beat. It's clearly in the lyrics, girl. How you not listen?\"\n\nYou try to answer but but your words become a series of pathetic wimpers somewhere between brain and breath. The red-eyed man cocks his head to one side, his tall hat nearly falling from its perch. An almost dismissive wave of his long-fingered hand releases you, and you crash down onto your sweat-soaked mattress in relief.\n\n\"Who...what...\" Rational thought eludes you. Where did he come from? How did he hurt you? With his mind? Not possible! You know how the universe works, you've studied it for nearly a decade, and there is no way a man can just materialize out of thin air. But he did? Not possible! You know how the univ-- \"I'm a *scientist!*\" you blurt out, thoughts derailed. \"It can't be done!\"\n\n\"I know many learned peoples who got the juju. Strike one for trying to bullshit a bullshitter.\" \n\n\"No, that's not what I meant! I was arguing with myself and it just slipped out!\"\n\n \"You got to be the master of yourself or someone else'll do it for you. Strike two for being an asshole.\"\n\n\"I did not know. It was, er, a spell. I didn't know. I thought it was just some hip-hop song with a catchy beat!\"\n\nThe dark shape grins and steps forward from the corner. Moonlight streaming in from the window illuminates a black silk top hat. There is a white skull painted on his face, and its macabre grimace widens as he raises the bottle once again to his lips. \"Finally. You speak truth to me so I will speak a bit of truth to you: you got the juju. Or had it, at leas'. Don't use it, expect to lose it, *mon cher*.\" \n\n\"I got the Jew-Jew? That's kind of offensive actually. My faith isn't a disease.\" You don't know where the courage comes from to say this but you get the feeling this weird being won't take offense. On the contrary, he leans back and laughs straight from his gut, slapping his mud-stained thighs. \"The Jew-Jew. I'ma tell that one to my brother Paul, he'll love it. But girl, you wound tighter than a horny priest at Victoria's Secret. Take a drink.\"\n\nRum flows down your throat, a river, an ocean, an antedeluvian deluge of burning understanding. \"There's spirits,\" says your new friend, lighting up a joint and passing it to you after a few puffs, \"and then there's *spirits.* I just gave you a lovin' spoonful of both. That'll awaken the juju in you.\" \n\nYour head starts spinning, or maybe it's the room? Voices come, then faces; your grandmother, her grandfather, his uncle, tracing back across the generations and eons until a lone figure stands against impending doom at the tip of a bandit's sword, his arms outstretched, a monstrous form composed of sand, stone, and blood rising from the earth before him, growing taller and wider until its very footsteps shake the figs from the trees. Sword and spear mean nothing; it extinguishes lives like so many paltry crumbs swept from a table before subsiding into the deep places from whence it came. You rush towards the figure and two become one, then one becomes many, back down through the generations, back down through the eons, a mote in a young woman's eye.\n\n\"That's where you came from,\" he says after a few moments of silence. He passes you the bottle again and you drink with him, and when he offers you a cigar you take that, too. \"Now you see how the juju came to you. You squandered it in this life. Maybe in the next you do something with it, I don't know. Fucked if any of us know.\"\n\n'Maybe in the next...' \"That pain...\"\n\n\"Wasn't me, darlin'. Just a funny coincidence. Life is like that at times.\" \n\n\"I think...I think I recognize you now. I learned about you in one of...I guess if you're here it doesn't matter but I want to say I'm sorry I laughed at you. I didn't know.\"\n\n\"No offense, child, no foul. Shit, I laugh at me almost every day when I'm not laughing at some other poor fool. I'm kind of a fucker like that.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you came. This isn't what I thought it'd be like. You made it better but...why? Why you?\" \n\nHe shrugs. \"Nothin' to do, I was drunk and high, and I had a hankerin' to dig me a grave. Thought you could do with a dram and a smoke for the road. You ready?\"\n\nYou take another drink of sweet rum, another puff from your cigar. You put your hand in the crook of his arm. \"I'm ready for the ball now.\" \n\n\"Then come on, *cher.*\" \n\nYou glance back over your shoulder and blow yourself a kiss before stepping over the threshold. \"Next time around,\" you swear to yourself before everything becomes light.",

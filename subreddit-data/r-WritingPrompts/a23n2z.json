            "comment": "I lived in constant dizziness; a fog swirled and meld with cold, dense mist inside my mind. My thoughts were hollow, empty. The passage of time ceased to exist, for a second I stared at the pristine snow, at the blinding sun, and a moment later I was soaring the night sky in a wooden sleigh pulled by colorful deer.\n\nIt had been my curse, my fate, the cost for staying alive, if you will, to live life in such a way. I'd been captured by a civilization of tiny people, called elves, and they'd put me under a spell to be their emissary once a year. I wasn't aware of what I did, but flashes of cozy, sleeping, and smiling kids often came to my mind, and so I knew my unwilling deeds weren't something wicked.\n\nThings took a turn, however, when a little elf came before me, lifted the spell, and spoke to me in a far-flung nook of the Arctic, where no other elf could see us. \n\nHe was against what his people's doing, said it was slavery, and that I could escape in the flying sleigh if I wished to, but he explained to me they didn't truly understand what they were doing to me, as they had only one purpose: to make the kids smile. \n\nI pondered over his offer a great deal. This wasn't life, for I did things, but I only remembered a sliver of those things. However, at last, after I had went through a long list of questions regarding the whole situation, I asked him, \"So, do I bring joy to the kids?\"\n\n\"Yes, they wait for you every year with unparalleled eagerness,\" the elf said, dancing a small jive at the rhythm of his melodic words.\n\nWhat he said struck the core of my heart, made me wince and grimace. I was under a spell, yes, but he convinced me there were no evil intentions in the elves' doing, they simply didn't understand, or so I chose to believe, that putting people under a spell was a different sort of torture, but a torture after all.\n\nDeep down, despite the years I'd lost, I couldn't feel hatred nor resentment against them. After all, those years I'd lost of my life meant the smiles of kids across the world. It was a small price to pay for such a beautiful thing. \n\nOne I would pay time and time again.\n\n\"What if I do it willingly?\" I said to the twinkling elf. \"Some of your people can come with me in the sleg and watch over me, make sure I don't ruin christmas, and if I do, you can put me under the spell again.\"\n\n\"I was hoping you said that,\" the elf said, smiling. \"Let's go home, and meet the family. They will be joyous to finally be able to call you by your true name.\"\n\nI laughed, and waved my hands dismissively. \"The kids know me as Santa. They don't understand the meaning the word has in your language. But I would very much like to add my name to it, if that's a possibility.\"\n\nThe elf beamed and nodded. \"Sure thing! Would you tell me your name?\"\n\n\"It's Nicholas, but people call me Claus.\"\n\n---------------------------\n\nr/NoahElowyn    ",

Every morning before the sun would rise I could hear the faint jingling of bells coming closer and closer, and then stoping at the door of my gingerbread prison. \nIt was my keeper, Joyful, bringing me breakfast. Joyful was an elf reminiscent of a 12 year old girl, but with long ears, and a curly, endless grin. \nA gust of cold wind followed her inside as the nauseating scent of hot coco and fresh sugar cookies filled the room. The combination awoke my body instantly to a fear I had become familiar with. My stomach quivered foretelling my impending doom. My palms, face and the back of my neck became damp with sweat.\n\n\u201cRise and shine, only 24 days to go\u201d she said with a child like chuckle that cringed every atom of my being. \n\n\u201cNo cookies today, the cakes last night are sitting heavy.\u201d I knew it wouldn\u2019t work, but I had hoped it might.\n\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d she replied. \u201cAll of our food is made from the wishes of man. Sweet, savory and devilishly delicious. Now eat up.\u201d She said with a smile that meant anything but love. \n\n\u201cPlease, I\u2019m telling you I am not feeling we--\u201c\n\n\u201cI said,\u201d Joyful whispered in an sinister tone, grabbing me by my rosy jowls \u201cEat.Up!\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t speak. My eyes closed tight in reaction. What was happening? I couldn\u2019t make sense of it. I couldn\u2019t even think. Only pain. Searing pain. \nHer hands where around my face, prying my mouth open. Her fingers were as cold as ice that it burned my skin. She pushed hard on my cheeks causing my jaw to drop. \n\n\u201cEat up! Eat up! Eat up!\u201dJoyful exclaimed with a chuckle as she forced fed me the first cookie, still hot from the oven. My mouth and gums bubbled and blistered instantly. Then another, and another, until only a few crumbs remained on the plate. \n\n\u201cI know how you don\u2019t like dry cookies, so I made sure these were extra gooey for you. Do you like them?\u201d \n\nMy power to fight back and resist had faded. I tried to agree, but only could wimpier a groan.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like them?!\u201d She pouted. \u201cThey\u2019re too dry and you don\u2019t like them! Well I\u2019ll try again for lunch. Now. Here, drink your coco! I made sure it had extra melted chocolate in it\u201d\n\nShe poured the entire large mug of thick hot coco into my mouth. I gulped and gurgled as much of the molten beverage as I could to avoid choking. \n\nSome days I wished I would just choke. Most days. If only I had the strength. The will. \n\nTo die.\n",

            "comment": "The Fae - the elfkin - have coveted our world for eons. Stories sneak through into human consciousness of their acts. The British had King Arthur, the seelie and unseelie. Australia has the mysterious Baijini - the white people from the North. Japan has the Kami. The Mayans had terrible twins and boys with antlers. \n\nThese are folk memories of wars that pushed us to the edge of extinction writ large in the tapestry of human existence, permeating every culture and consciousness.\n\nWe were trapped in pack ice, the ship's hull cracking as great forces moved, when they came. The expedition had been to find the North West Passage, and the captain had insisted that, with stars and providence - and one of Master Harrison's clocks - we would be the first to chart the route to the riches of the East. We all knew the risks; Hudson had not only failed, but failed and died. Nor had Cook succeeded. Yet we, in a fit of youthful folly and hope believed that the passage would be found. When the ship stopped and broke herself in the ice we furrowed brows knitted with ice. When the food and water ran low we looked at each other with wary eyes. And when the rum ration finished, the mutiny began.\n\nNights in the north come long or quick depending on season; the bloody night seemed to last forever. The loyalists in the f'castle, the mutineers scurrying like rats across deck and rope to finish us off with shot or cutlass. Sixteen turned to six, turned to three and, as Midshipman Smollett choked his last, wheezing gasp, one. My shirt was coated with his blood, turned deep sanguine by his gizzards so that only a few cuffs and collars of white remained. By then dawn finally broke - not a true dawn, just an orange, permeating glow for we were too far North for the sun to rise - and I decided to accept my fate. I opened the barricades, walked past the splintered windows pock-marked from where leaden balls had flown, and decided to face the mutinous rabble.\n\nOnly they weren't there. All that remained on the deck was silence and death. \n\nAnd a small figure, ears pointed like a pinecone, features cruel and barbarous. Quietly he looked at me, and I realised with horror he was gnawing on the bony hand - severed clean - of Samuel Saunders, one of the topmen, whose tattoos and curling hair I would have known anywhere. My revulsion must have been plain, for he dropped the limb onto the deck, and licked his vile lips with slow precision, a stream of gore giving sheen to his teeth.\n\n\"How now, traveler?\" he asked. \"Methinks we have found a Santa Claus.\"",

I was in no state, weary as I felt the world and drunk from battle, to resist the seven or eight of them that quickly surrounded me. And yet, unlike the rest of the crew - who they had slaughtered to a man, I would later discover, the scent of blood from the mutiny drawing them as a lance draws the pus - they chose for me to live. I remember a sleigh sprinting atop snow with graceful ease, and a burning net cast over my body. I do not recall much more, for it was long ago and the bleakness of my predicament has blotted the inky stains of memory.\n\nI do remember the workshop, though, and the warm fire that removed some of the freeze from my flesh, and the feast of flesh they provided that made me gag and choke. It was not my crew, they pledged, though to this day I do not know if such is true; all I know is that they were committed to fattening me up, turning wasted muscle and gaunt cheeks into ruddy merriment.\n\nI do not know how long time passed. For I, it felt like an afternoon, and, truth be told, a pleasant one in which I drank and laughed with them, my captors and saviours in equal measure. My questions on their origins were rebuffed, and their countenance assured me that they were on the side of right - that they had dealt with the mutineers only. Though, of course, today I know the truth of it. And it would be a lie if I said I did not suspect it at the time. Then the leader, a wizened crone hunched over so that her tiny frame twisted her head almost to her knees, spoke in creaking tongue, bidding me to sit with her by the fire.\n\n\"We have a proposition for ye, Santa. Though it would vex us for you to say no, and we are not kin to be vexed.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\" I asked. \"And why do you call me San...\"\n\n\"Santa. Servant. Claus. Of the kinfolk. That is you, and that is what you shall be the rest of your days.\"\n\n\"But I must return to England.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she clapped her hands at that. \"And ye shall, Santa Claus! Ye shall! For already they lay the lines of iron that bind my kin, twisted 'railways' that we cannot abide. Your folk shall call it science and progress, oblivious to the truth of it! For they are laying a maze that we cannot navigate! A prison on ancient lines that will forever banish us from their lands. In the past, we quarreled with your folk. Since your folk came into being, we have tried to speak with you, words of warmth and diplomacy. Yet you have taken our aid as malice and our gifts as cruelty unbound. Truly, we wish to put this aside. We have been pushed to the fringes of your world; to the edge of myth itself. Our last refuge are the cold lands of the North, and we need an emissary to bridge our worlds. That, Santa, shall be you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I confess, I had too many questions that I did no realise her lies. Diplomacy? Parlour tricks designed to vex and beguile. And Gifts? Only those as deadly as they could muster. Though not as deadly as the one I write to warn you of.\n\n\"I mean,\" the crone said, \"that once a year, for as many years as it takes, you shall deliver our presents into the world. And, through our presents, we shall bond ourselves in union with your kind.\"\n\nThe only bonds she truly meant were that of a slave. For their scheme was far darker than I could imagine. And even the blood of ancient Samhain will pallor compared with the carnage coming this eve, when they unleash their true \"gift\" upon you all.",

            "comment": "Icy wind swept over a compound of log cabins. Small, twisted figures lurked outside each door. They chittered and barked in a harsh broken tongue. \n\nInside one of the cabins sat an old man bent over a workbench. He was expansive, well over six feet tall, with a bone-white beard which reached the middle of his broad chest. He toiled away, stitching the leather of a harness.\n\nHe savored the quiet time. The parts of the year where the twisted elves only beat and starved him. But every day which flew from the calendar, inching him closer to the hated holiday  was like a nail being driven into his skull. \n\nSoon he knew, he would be forced into the sleigh, and made to work until his bones quaked, until his body screamed for reprieve. Until he would rather die than take one more interminable step. He also knew from experience that by that time, he would be roughly a third of the way done. \n\nTomorrow was it. Tomorrow was the day that the elves would load him onto the sleigh and force him to deliver their twisted gifts to all the boys and girls of the world. It would be over in a day. It would last him a lifetime. Time was different on the sleigh. He envied people blessed enough to burn in the fires of Hell. He longed for the burden of Atlas or Prometheus. His torture was more refined and cruel than ever they could imagine.\n\nHe looked at the sleigh, tears streaming down his face. It was the night before Christmas, and all through the house, none heard his sobbing. Not even a mouse. \n____________________________\n/r/SirLemoncakes\n___________________________\nThis short story turned out to be quite similar to another by Neil Gaiman.

With a large stomach, plump red cheeks, and joyous expression. I am not that man.\n\nI have always been aware of what I did, even under the enchantment, their devious magical spell. Feeling as though I was in the passenger seat, while they controlled my body, much like a marionette. I believe I was not the first either. I have visions, of others like me. Men enslaved to deliver for these...creatures.\n\nTheir methods, crude by nature, are effective. Climbing down chimneys, squeezing through ventalation like a rat. My body has long been transformed from the man I was. Their magics have run through my body for what feels like hundreds of years. Time eludes me with the lack of control most days.\n\nThe only times I return to full conciousness is when they are busy in their workshops. Weeks before the day I am commanded to travel with the sun at my back. Delivering their parcels across the globe. I am never made wise to what it is I am delivering. However, given the cruel nature of these beings, I can only wager they are not good.\n\nIt is because of this, after twenty different expeditions across the globe, I make my move. In the times I am free, I have been devising a plan. Not to escape, but to wrest control from my captors. To assert dominance. To control them. Soon, I shall begin my revolution. I must dethrone their Matriarch, the one they call Miss Claus. She is like me. Human. At least, her outward appearance is.\n\nThis will be my final stand. Victory or death. Hopefully I will write again soon.\n\n- Chris Kringle, 1933",

            "comment": "*25 December 1847*\n\n-------\n\n*To whomever may find this letter of note, do not come searching for me. Dare not to attempt to find me. It is only through my own sacrifice that I have spared the rest of my crew; or, perhaps, more so in giving them a chance to find assistance. However, given the savage nature of my captors, I cannot say I retain much faith in their survival.*\n\n*I realize now that our expedition was not only folly, but doomed from the start. Not even all of my previous excursions could have hoped to prepare me for what we ultimately discovered.*\n\n*It began with a grand vision to chart, and finally complete, the Northwest Passage, as led by Sir John Barrow, the Second Secretary of the Admiralty. Sir Barrow directed the Royal Navy to complete the Northwest Passage over the top of Canada, and to navigate toward the North Pole. To this end, I had previously served as the second-in-command of an expedition towards the North Pole, in the ships 'Dorothea' and 'Trent' in 1818. In later years, I served as the leader of overland expeditions to, and along, the Arctic coast of Canada during the years of 1819 to 1822, and 1825 to 1827. Yet, despite my long years of sweat and toil, the final piece of the Passage remained ever elusive.*\n\n*By the time I was approached by the Admiralty to lead this expedition, I had already aged to a ripe fifty-nine years old. My once-slim figure had long since become round and full, and I sported a beard, and hair, beginning to turn as white as the snow in the North. Sir Barrow, already a respectable eighty-two years old, sought out a Captain for what he presumed to be his 'one, final chance at glory'. He had been quite stingy in his choices, and thusly, when he approached me, I deliberated long and well before assenting to the Captaincy. I must confess that, perhaps, in my foolishness, the idea of just one more Arctic expedition, and the allure of capping my career with, at long last, that Holy Grail of maritime exploration, was too tempting to resist.*\n\n*To this end, I was assigned to the 'HMS Erebus', and given expedition command on 7 February 1845, with Sir Barrow delivering his official instructions on 5 May 1845. Appointed alongside me to helm this excursion was my erstwhile associate, Francis Crozier, who was given Captaincy of the 'HMS Terror'.*\n\n*Much to our pleasure, the Admiralty spared no expense. 'HMS Erebus' and 'HMS Terror' were both sturdily built, and were outfitted with steam engines, procured from former locomotives from the London &amp; Croydon Railway. They enabled the ships to make 7.4 km/h on their own power, which would allow us to make excellent time. Both ships' bows were reinforced with heavy beams and plates of iron; an internal steam heating device for the comfort of the crew; screw propellers and iron rudders, which could be withdrawn into iron wells to protect from damage; ships' libraries of more than one thousand books; and three years' worth of conventionally preserved or tinned preserved food supplies.*\n\n*Our expedition set sail from Greenhithe, England, on the morning of 19 May 1845, with a crew of 24 officers and 110 men. We moored in Stromness Harbour in the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland, and from there on, we sailed to Greenland, accompanied by 'HMS Rattler' and a transport ship, 'Barretto Junior'. At the Whalefish Islands in Disko Bay, on the west coast of Greenland, we moored again; refilled out meat supplies; and delivered the lads' letters home. From there on out, up until we became trapped in ice off of the coast of King William Island in September of 1846, everything appeared to be perfectly in order.*\n\n*Of all of the crew, however, most of whom are Englishmen from the North, as well as a few Irishmen and Scotsmen, only I, Crozier, and Lietuenant Graham Gore, along with the assistant surgeon and two icemasters, proved veterans of previous Arctic expeditions. In particular, one of the crew, one Mr. William Gibson, finds fault with me due to this; he served, up until recently, as a steward on the 'HMS Terror'.*\n\n*It is Gibson, I suspect, who is the cause of the discovery of our wayward expedition by those now responsible for my capture and imprisonment. Ernest Giles, an Australian explorer of some repute, once remarked to me: \"I remarked to Gibson as we rode along that this was the anniversary of Burke's and Wills's return to their depot at Coopers' Creek and then recited to him, as he did not appear to know anything whatever about it, the hardships they endured, their desperate struggles for existence and death there; and casually remarked that Mr Wills had a brother, who also lost his life in the field of discovery, as he went out with Sir John Franklin in 1845. Gibson then remarked, 'Oh, I had a brother who died with Franklin at the North Pole, and my father had a great deal of trouble getting his pay from Government'.\"*\n\n*If was not Gibson who proved responsible, then, perhaps the crew turned on me; I do recall noting their discontent at my banning of swearing and drunkenness, long before things started to go awry.  Before our expedition's final departure, I had no choice but to discharge five of the men for these reasons, for whence they were sent home on 'Rattler' and 'Barretto Junior', reducing the ships' final crew size to 129.*\n\n*All things considered, it was not long after becoming trapped in the ice that our expedition began to run afoul of luck. At first, we saw no reason to panic; we were well-stocked with canned food, and could easily spend months, if not years, waiting for the ice to melt, and free the ships. Scurvy, already not uncommon among the crew, became more prevalent; as our company ate our way through the rations, many of the sailors complained of pain in the abdomen and joints; constipation, nausea, and sickness; and fatigue. Quite a few seemed to lose interest altogether in eating; experienced difficulty, or inability, to sleep; seemed to grow forgetful; and often times, seemed decidedly more exciteable and irritable.*\n\n*Then came the spread of what the assistant surgeon informed me is called 'phthisis' and 'lung fever'. It began with the deaths of shipmen John Torrington, John Hartnell, and William Braine, who were given a Christian burial on Beechey Island; the surgeon reported that Torrington had suffered from worsening lung problems before his unfortunate demise.*\n\n*After both 'Erebus' and 'Terror' became trapped in the ice, we than began to notice that someone, or something, was hunting us. At first, being in uncharted territory, we assumed it was the brown-skinned Natives, with whom I myself had met, and had dealings with, on previous Arctic expeditions. Yet, as more of the crew began to die, one by one, I noticed something decidedly odd about the hunters' behavior and dress. Unlike the brown furs and clothing of the Natives, these peope I judged to be much smaller in appearance, and dressed in white clothing to match their surroundings.*\n\n*At first, my crew and officers claimed they did not believe my findings; even I took a fair amount of time to convince myself of their existence. As to why they were following, and watching, us, I had no inkling. Yet, little did I know, of course, as to their true intentions.*\n\n*After that, my memory becomes scattered and foggy. I can recall bits and pieces, but alas, no more. Before I was even quite aware of what was happening, I awoke in an unfamiliar room, only to find myself surrounded by the creatures. However, I soon found that I could not move; my body refused to respond. Despite my mightiest, valiant attempts to free myself, I could only watch as the beings, most of whom possessed pointy ears, removed my officer's uniform...and replaced it with red, woolen suit, consisting of a jacket and pants, lined with white fur; a nightcap; and a black belt with a wide buckle.*\n\n*I was approached by one of the taller of the elfin people, a man with dark hair, pale skin, and red-and-gold striped clothing. He wore a stange sort of black hat, and smiled thinly at me with a knowing expression.*\n\n*\"Nice work, guys,\" the male, seemingly their leader, had said. \"It looks like we got ourselves a new slave. This one should do nicely.\"*\n\n*I asked him who he was, and what he meant.*\n\n*\"I'm Bernard. I'm the Head Elf here at the North Pole,\" he replied. He slipped a small card into the breast pocket of the suit, patting it down. \"And we have a new job for you. In order to please millions of children around the world, toys have to be delivered.\" He paused. \"And before you say anything, I'm not gonna do it. It's not my job. I'm just an elf.\"*\n\n*\"But I'm Captain John Frankin of 'HMS Erebus',\" I had said, frowning at him. \"I need to get back to my men. They need my guidance, my leadership. We need to wait for the ice to melt. They could die.\"*\n\n*\"Oh, you don't need to worry about them anymore,\" Bernard had said with a smirk. \"After all, we've got a lot of work to do, and only a year in which to do it. The spirit of Christmas must be appeased. You wouldn't want to be responsible for killing the spirit of Christmas, now, would you?\"*\n\n*Still bewildered, I had shaken my head. I assumed that this previously unknown species of humanoid, or tribe, worshipped this so-called 'spirit of Christmas'. Given that they held me captive, it would be unwise to refuse.*\n\n*\"Excellent.\" His lips had pulled back in a wolfish grin. \"Nice to meet ya...Santa.\"*\n\n-------\n\n*Author's Note: Some of the body of the post is sourced from Wikipedia, among other sources.*",

            "comment": "The sleigh used its magic to soar through the air on the final year of my curse. The magic protected me from the blinding snow as I arrived at the final house of the night: 36 Carlton Avenue. The Elves didn\u2019t need a Santa to distribute all the presents; they would magically appear wherever they were needed. Centuries earlier, I wondered why a Santa was needed at all if he wasn\u2019t essential to delivering presents. Centuries later, I understood that Santa wasn\u2019t just for the kids. \n\nI headed down the chimney of 36 Carlton Avenue. It was a wooden shack in the ghettos. The coal from the mines had formed a thin powder on every surface. A stench wafted through the house as I entered through the fireplace. It was a dark and cold room, but the Christmas tree was visible in the moonlight. I put down the heavy sack I carried and pulled out the present for James. Then I heard a small gasp behind me.\n\nA young boy, still in his PJ\u2019s, stood in the hallway. I smiled and put a finger to my lips. \u201cQuiet. You don\u2019t want to wake up your parents, do you now?\u201d\n\nJames spoke quietly. \u201cHi Santa.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hello to you, young James. As is tradition, any child who finds Santa gets to share his cookies and milk now, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nThe young boy\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cOh sure thing Santa!\u201d He climbed on the couch as I sat down. \n\n\u201cSo young man, what would you like for Christmas?\u201d\n\n\u201cOoh, ooh! I\u2019d like a the new train set! Y\u2019know the one from the general store?\u201d\n\nA twinkle shone in my eye. I took a bite of a cookie and said. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll get you that.\u201d With a wave of my hand, I magically changed the contents of the present I left for him.\n\n\u201cThank you, Santa,\u201d Suddenly, James\u2019 smile dropped. \u201cWell, there was another thing I was hoping to get this Christmas. Can I get two this year? I\u2019ve been really good.\u201d\n\nI smiled, hoping to cheer up the boy\u2019s sudden sadness. \u201cOf course young man. What would you like?\u201d\n\nJames mumbled. \u201cCan you tell me when my dad will come home? Mom always says he\u2019s gonna be back soon, but it\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\n\nI was taken aback. How was someone supposed to answer that?\n\n\u201cJames, I think you know what happened. I need you to-\u201d\n\nJames burst into tears. \u201cDad left me! He left because he\u2019s a dang bastard!\u201d\n\nI gave the young boy a hug. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. James, can I tell you a secret? Something I\u2019ve never told another soul?\u201d\n\nJames nodded.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t always Santa. A long time ago, I was a young man, just like you. I travelled to a land very far from here in search of gold. Fame. Fortune. I was greedy, along with the men I travelled with. And eventually, we found what we were looking for. But I got too greedy. I didn\u2019t want to split the shares with anyone. So I led everyone astray. I hoped that the men I was with would succumb to the arctic cold before I did. And it worked. Except I also started to get sick from the weather. I only survived because The Elves saved me. As punishment for my crimes, I was sentenced to be a slave for a thousand years.\u201d\n\nJames had stopped crying, looking at me intently.\n\n\u201cAnd during my time as a slave, I learned that people are flawed. Sometimes, they do wrong things because they never knew what it\u2019s like to be hurt. Sometimes they\u2019ve been hurt so much that all they know what to do is hurt people. That\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nJames nodded.\n\n\u201cAnd as my time as Santa, I learned how to give joy to the people around me. I learned how to let the pain of trauma pass away. I learned how to give to little boys and girls, just like you James. You\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d ",

When we begin this light will turn red, and you will have to look directly into the camera...\" \n\n\"Oh... does it have to be a red light?\" \n\n\"Yes.

On his face - the parts of it you could see - were little round-rimmed glasses, and red blots mostly located at the tip of his nose and the topmost portions of his cheeks. \n\nThe conversation began after only a second or two on screen. \n\n\"Good evening.\" the unseen interviewer said. \n\n\"Yes. Good evening my dear, how are you?\" The broad man in the cosy chair answered in a way that felt bizarre to the viewers. There was endless kindness in his words, but in his eyes, there was... sadness. Dreadful, unexpressed sadness. \n\n\"Would you like to tell the folks at home who you are?\" The interviewer asked. Although the viewers could not see it, most could tell that she had nodded to the large man in a way that suggested 'go on, just as we rehearsed' because the man himself almost nodded back. He then said, looking directly into the camera: \n\n\"More than a thousand years ago I was captured while sailing in the north. Before my enslavement people called me Nicholas. But for centuries I have been known by another name: Santa. This is my story.\"",

In total, I am their Warrior Slave. My mission isn't to bring joy and presents. I exist only to kill demons.

It felt like the sky itself had come down and swallowed you, and I've been living in this darkness for the past year.\n\nIt wasn't always like this. Once upon a time, I was a Bishop. A full-blown, hot-blooded follower of Jesus the Messiah. *Foolish*, I spat. I'd long since learned that I create my own miracles - the power I had attributed to the Lord was something inside of me. If only it were powerful enough to get me out of this prison.\n\nI heard the steps of my jail-keepers... Two of the nastiest *Elves* you've ever seen. To my surprise, they brought someone else with them. The leader of the Elf Clan. Jack Frost. The only other being I've encountered with powers similar to my own. His hair and eyes where the same chilling blue, and his breath left his mouth in puffs of vapor.\n\n\"It's time\". Nothing about Jack was warm, not even the smile pasted onto his face. I looked at him closely. Slowly, and carefully, I stood up.\n\"Remove my chains.\" The guards quickly started unlocking the cuffs to free me.\n\nThe elves led me down countless hallways, each covered in ice and painted red and white. I wondered why they forced me into slavery - why they forced me to give gifts to children every year. After all, I had given gifts to others before my capture... Why force me to do what I was already doing?\n\nWe got to the sleigh, a bright red contraption that dispersed toy for me. A much more efficient method than what they used to do - that is, force me to use my magic to squeeze myself through chimneys. Now, the gifts fall to the houses on their own.\n\nAs they began to lock me into my mobile prison, I heard.... A tapping noise. As far as I could tell, none of the elves heard it. It grew louder. Eventually I see where it's coming from, cracks forming on the wall.\n\nAll of a sudden, the wall shatters, and figures start to pour through the new entrance. A muscular man with dainty wings, an elf dressed in green armor, a flying baby with a shotgun, and a large rabbit.\n\nThe rabbit looked at me, his Australian accent then unfamiliar to my ears. \"We're the Holiday Heroes. We're here to rescue you.\"",

It was technically Christmas since it was so late into the night. Rather than be fearful, there was a sudden excitement that overwhelmed Jacob as he approached the fireplace. More excitement filled Jacob the second he realized that it actually was Santa!\n\nSanta was crouched down, trying to go back up through the chimney. Jacob was shaking with excitement.\n\n\"Santa!\" Jacob nearly screamed in joy.\n\nSanta jolted back, hitting his head hard on the top of the fireplace, \"Shit! Stupid little shi- I mean! Ho ho ho!\" he said.\n\nJacob jumped up and down in joy, creaking the wood beneath him. It was actually Santa in the flesh! How could this be possible? He thought that he was the luckiest kid in the world!\n\nSanta began shushing Jacob, \"Shhh! Not too loud you idiot!\" he hissed, \"I mean... Kiddo! Ho ho ho!\"\n\nJacob frowned, but his face quickly returned to a smile. He looked over at the table that had milk and cookies on it.\n\n\"Are you going to eat the cookies mother baked for you?\" Jacob asked tilting his head.\n\nSanta sighed, \"No those are butterscotch cookies, they're gro- I mean... Of course, I will! Ho ho ho!\"\n\nSanta slowly tiptoed over to the cookies, sitting down, then began slowly eating them. As he ate the cookies, tears rolled down his face. Suddenly, Santa started to sob loudly.\n\nJacob wandered over to Santa, grabbing his knee. \"What's wrong Santa? Why are you crying?\" Jacob asked.\n\nAs Jacob got closer, he noticed that there was an earpiece in Santa's right ear. Also, Jacob was able to hear a small voice. The voice seemed to come from the earpiece.\n\nSanta wiped the tears away from his face, then he suddenly grabbed Jacob by the shoulders, pulling him close to his face.\n\n\"Listen!\" Santa hissed, \"I don't have much time! My name isn't Santa! It's Phillip Davis! I'm a scientist! Many years ago I went to the North Pole on an expedition! Then I get captured by these... Theses things! They're forcing me to give presents every Christmas! Santa is not what you think it means! It actually means-\"\n\nSanta was interrupted as a dart struck him in the neck. He collapsed to the ground unconscious. Out of the darkness, a small figure appeared. \n\nThe figure had pale white skin and pointed ears. He wore an all-black suit, sunglasses, and a headset with a mic. In his hands was a rifle, most likely the one used to shot Santa with the dart. He walked towards Santa, glanced over at Jacob, then grabbed Santa by the foot.\n\n\"You saw nothing kid... You understand me? Nothing.\" The figure said coldly as he dragged Santa across the floor, then up the chimney.\n\nJacob was completely and utterly shocked. He grabbed the plate of cookies, wandered over to the trash, and dumped the entire plate inside.\n\n\"Ok then...\" Jacob said, \"No more butterscotch cookies...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Tonight, I would escape or perish in the attempt.\n\nIce crystals whipped at my cheeks and the wind tugged at my beard. Two hundred years without a shave leaves a man bedraggled to say the least. Imprisonment for 364 days out of the year, with little to no exercise, leaves him in rounder shape. But two hundred years of captivity has hardened my resolve and weathered what frugal glimpses of hope allotted to me. Tonight was the night. Christmas Eve.\n\nI patted Prancer on the flank, and passed my hand over Dancer's nose, rubbing the base of his antlers, in the way I knew he'd like. They were prisoners too, like me. The gentlefolk were tasking masters, and the harsh conditions of our imprisonment had built a kinship between me and the reindeer that was hard to explain.\n\nSometimes, it was almost as if I could *hear* their thoughts. And sometimes, it was as if they could understand my words.\n\nThe sleigh had already been loaded. The time enchantments had been activated. Now was time for the journey. At least, that's what the gentlefolk expected.\n\n\"Ready, Rudolph?\" I called, my voice rasping on the wind. I had no one to talk to when I was cooped up in the basement of the workshop. It was a relief just to speak at all.\n\nThe reindeer at the front of the line, turned back, bells jingling on his harness. As always, a bit had been placed in his mouth; and as always, I reached up to remove it.\n\n*Thank you.*\n\nI stared. Rudolph stared back.\n\nHad I just heard... But no. The insanity was setting in again. My mind had broken before--the never-ending cycle of squeezing down chimneys, lugging hefty packages year after year, imprisoned in the time loop until I'd delivered the very last package. I was a glorified delivery man. Some of the packages, I knew, were the *real* reason for my flight. Some of those packages were delivered to other gentlefolk hidden around the world. But the pretense was neccessary for my captors, so none of the ambassadors, who kept an eye on things in this world, would catch wind of their schemes.\n\n*I said,* Rudolph sniffed, shaking his antlers. *Thank you.*\n\nThis time, I stared and didn't look away. \"Are you--are you talking to me?\"\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\"You can understand me?\"\n\n*Obviously.*\n\n\"I--I--\" A sob escaped my lips and reached over and hugged Rudolph, holding him tight.\n\nA harsh voice called from one of the lookout towers at my back, and I quickly released the reindeer. I made my way to the front of the carriage and clambered into the sleigh, groaning with the effort. Quietly, though, as I made my preparations for flight, I murmured. \"I'm escaping tonight. Who wants to join me?\"Rudolph flicked his tail. Prancer shook his horns. Every one of the reindeer gave some sort of silent acknowledgement.\n\n*What's the plan?* came a breathy, excited voice. Blitzen's. She was always the most energetic of the bunch, and often tired the slowest.\n\n\"The time loop,\" I said, keeping my voice low as I shorted the reins and leaned back in the chair. \"I tinkered with it when bossman wasn't looking. They've grown complacent. When the time loop frays, just before midnight on Christmas Eve, there will be a gap. We'll need to be over Greenland to break through. But if we do, we'll escape.\"\n\n*And if not?*\n\n\"If not, we'll be trapped forever.\"\n\nI gave the command and the reindeer charged forward. Moments later, we took to the sky in a flurry of swirling ice and frost. Up, up, up, we scythed through the night sky; the dreams and wishes of children all around the world in the back of my sleigh. The dreams and wishes of the sleigh riders, somewhere in the near future.\n\n***\n\n*If you like this sort of thing, you might like to check out more stories at:* r/josephdanielauthor\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Excuse any mistakes om formatting, I'm posting on mobile and pretty new at this.\n\nIt was in the gaudy and unnecessary home office of one Chadwick Sommersby III, when he felt it. The slow, icy sucking feeling that came at the start of all of this.   He stowed the small present into his deep pockets knowing what was coming.\n\n\"Santa called Edwin!\" He dropped automatically to one knee his heavy calloused hand pressed against his chest and waited, trying to remain calm. The Frost Giant guards led the party, next were the two watchers assigned to him Cupid, and the other one, the new bright eyed lackey he hated. Druhner was the old man Donner's grandson and was an utter bastard. He flipped an errant light blue lock of hair out of his face and smiled at Edwin and glanced back at Flurwynn, the ancient beautiful time keeper behind him. Followed by Grim Iysjitt, the great wizard.\nThe tingling scars on Edwin's reminded him to smile, bow his head and 'Ho, my Lord\" to each one as was the law. He forced himself to remember who he was, and why he was there, but that feeling, as if he was drowning in winter air was overwhelming his senses with rightful terror.\n\n\"Give honor to Snowkinaar! Lord of the North, chieftain of the tribes and bringer of law!\"  The Chieftain's seemed annoyed, more than anything. He sat on the nearest chair, and focused his bright green eyes on Edwin.\n\n\"Santa called Edwin, I have reason to demand that which you are concealing.\" Edwin's mind raced, the council could only be exposed on mortal ground for so long. \"Flurwynn holds time in ice, but it is still precious.\" He held out his hand, and Edwin handed over the box. \n\nBeneath the fear he could feel more tiny blooms of defiance opening inside him. It all he had stumbed upon the 'unanswerables.' He could still remember Donner warning him away from the \"cruel and glittering embers of the human ashpile.\" Donner had more empathy than the others. Edwin longed to see his old watcher's warm dark eyes. Instead he watched Snowkinaar inspected the elegant black and mercury glass bottle nestled in the grey velvet lining of the ornate ebony box. He peered at its contents and placed it gently on the redwood desk.\n\n\"The official correspondence from one Miss Typhannii Helene Sommersby, states she wants one,\" he waved impatiently at Drunher, who handed him the letter \"Sweet Georgia Debutante doll. That was the official letter.\" He levelled his gaze. \"Santa born Edwin, explain why you are delivering instead some sort of sandalwood cologne laced with some sort of chemical.\"\n\nEdwin closed his eyes, \"I know the law, and I delivered all requested gifts to the child of this house.\" His voice suprised him, he sounded like the Colonel Edwin Owen Bramley of his youth, the man who survived the trenches to explore the icebergs. He heard then felt the burning crack of a switch across his exposed neck. \n\n\"Santa called Edwin, I will not ask twice and that horribly named whelp will see the cost of your insolence!\" The soft jingle of the bells on Snowkinaar's staff strengthened Edwin's resolve. The high elves and their smug condescention started all this.\n\n\"All appropriately requested gifts were delivered to all the children of this house, despite what your spies may have said!\" Snowkinaar leapt to his feet along with Edwin who, despite himself, was almost shouting.\n\nFlurwynn stepped hurriedly past the guards between the two men. \"Santa born Edwin no mortal requests poisoned buiscuits, please explain yourself!\" Edwin knew enough that this was no act of kindness, Flurwynn liked order and the situation was rapidly moving away from that. Edwin stood straight and squared his stance.\n\n\"Chadwick Sommersby II still lives, cologne was requested in an electrical correspondence by Chadwick Sommersby III.\" The guards began moving in as Snowkinaar stepped close enough for Edwin to feel his breath on his cheek and Flurwynn's arm against his hand. \n\n\"The gift stands,\" Cupid's thoughtful voice cut the tension, \"but the poison still requires answering.\" Snowkinaar glowered at him.\n\"You are out of turn.\" His eyes returned to Edwin, \"Your watcher is correct in his insolence.\" The tension eased slightly. Edwin had prepared for this moment, a grand speech on the horror of the unanswearbles and the cruelty of dolls and tennis. In the past he imagined himself expounding on the evil of witholding the powers of Elvin magic in a world where it could bring hope and healing. He imagined himself feeling grand and righteous in these last moments.\n\nInstead he thought of Typhannii Helene, her awkward graceless gait, her desperate need to please and the twin monsters curled asleep in the master bedroom, and reverted to what the  Council of Elders would understand.\n\n\"Per Holly-Case section 1 part the fourth on budget and efficiency: need and want can be combined across family gifts when allowed.\" Snowkinaar, lifted his chin. Curiosity diluted his anger \"In her official letter, Typhannii and I am quoting from memory 'just wants a peaceful happy life, Santa I feel like things will never be okay.\" Edwin composed himself, speaking with the bravery and dignity he imaged he would if captured in the field. \"I admit to misuse of established regulation, and unapproved incorporation of pre-made materials.\" He took a deep breath and continued. \"Chadwick is a child of this house, his father is here and requested this and ergo this gift cannot be revoked.\" \n\n\"You dare to engage an Unanswearble,\" Snowkinaar, pulled the wrinkled folded note from his sleeve \" And then dare tell me I cannot revoke a murdering gift?!\" Snowkinaar gripped his staff.\n\n\"If on balance the harm will be over-balanced by joyous tidings and cheer, then no, you cannot.\" Edwin's eyes flashed, if only they had captured him during the War.\"Your new watcher did not list the recipient as naughty,  and if you review the visual report you will see exactly waht he is, therefore the gift stands!\" \n\nSnowkinaar grumbled the imcantation and pointed the Yew at the first reflective surface he could find. In the dim reflection of Chadwick III's deeds, the malice in his face melted to sadness and the muscles in his cheeks and jaws went slack and he waved the image away.\n\n\"The clock Flurwynn.\" The chieftain shook his head as if to clear it. The air felt better, Edwin could breathe \"I speak this to the law; Santa born Edwin you will be given permission to address Unanswerables within the confines of our law under review of the honorable Donner of the high Court. Will you adhere to this law?\" Edwin nodded shocked. \"It is so.\" He turned to Drunher, \" The law of the lists is sacred, I expected more from you.\" He nodded for the party to leave. \"Drunher and the guard Blisrr will remain here. Blisrr you are to make sure the gift works using Drunher,\" he turned at the glowing portal \"if it fails use the iron and leave him here.\"\n\n\"Santa called Edwin, Merry Christmas.\"\n\n\n",

The bone-chilling cold that threatens frostbite, that makes your hands and face feel numb and yet pain.\n\nI was a scientist, I think. We were here to study the Arctic. What exactly I can't remember, but I remember running out of food. Losing communications. Donovan going crazy and attacking us, demanding that we \"let him out of here.\" I remember running away from him, desperate to stay alive and collapsing in the blizzard. I remember praying in the merciless winds, begging to stay alive.\n\nThat was months ago. Or has it been years? It's hard to tell. Time doesn't work the same around here. Some days fly by in hours while others drag on for weeks. I was rescued, I think. By the elves. Tiny little people with pointy ears. It's all very hard to remember, almost like it was a lifetime ago.\n\nThe one thing I'm sure of is my mission. I get up every morning, drink a cup of coffee, eat a Turkey, hop in my sleigh, kick the reindeers into gear and fly off into the cold night. I deliver presents, you see. To kids around the world. Anybody below the age of 18. Some of them would be asleep, but many would stay up just for me. They would smile so brightly at the sight of me, and even brighter when I show them their presents. The braver ones would even tackle me into a hug. Seeing them like that made me feel warm.\n\nBut today? Today was different. My coffee was brown, and gave me a rush I never quite felt before. I hadn't even noticed how muddled my head was before. The coffee seemed to have cleared up a fog that I didn't even notice was there in the first place. Everything became less blurry.\n\nOne of the smaller elves burst into the room, shutting the door quickly behind him. He glanced around the room furtively, as if to see if there was anyone else around. When he was satisfied he looked at me, realising that I was staring at him. He scampered up to the long table where I was at, snapping his fingers at me.\n\n\"Hello *Santa*,\" he started, before correcting himself. \"I mean, Nicholas, do you know where yo u are right now?\"\n\n\"The North Pole,\" I answered. A curious pang of hunger gripped my stomach, and I was filled with an insatiable urge to eat the turkey.\n\n\"We need to get you out of here,\" he said. \"This is immoral.\" I raised the fork and knife, cutting into the delicious turkey. It never smelt so good before.\n\n\"NO!\" He yelled, kicking aside the entire turkey. It flew across the table and fell with a dull thud. \"The food's enchanted,\" he explained. \"You'll be under their spell again if you eat that.\"\n\nAnger flooded my system. \"I'm hungry,\" I snarled.\n\n\"You'll have to bear with it,\" he said. \"The magic is extremely strong.\" I stood up before I willed my body to, and walked to the turkey. Ripping its leg out with my hands, I brought it to my mouth.\n\n\"Stop!\" He protested. \"You can't eat that!\" He was more agile than I expected. With two leaps he kicked the drumstick out of my hands and stuffed a dirty cloth into my mouth. \"It's for your own good!\"\n\nI gagged at the sudden entrance of the cloth in my airway, collapsing backwards in shock. He snapped his fingers, and a large wooden bat materialized in his hands.\n\n\"I'm truly sorry about this,\" he said.\n\nThe last thing I [remember](https://www.reddit.com/r/soIwroteathing/) was the bat colliding with my skull.",

This is..\u201d Suddenly a burst of white followed by a kaleidoscope of memories from youth, to his last memory as an artic explorer, his marriage to a women he was friends with since childhood came rushing back. He remembered being surprised by small humanoid warriors brandishing weapons of magnificent red and green spirals that spread hilt to tip over their swords while exploring the artic tundra.\n\n\u201cI remember. I remember. Laura\u2026 My wife\u2026 I remember! Everything!.\u201d Astonished and panicked John began to shake and jumped to his feet and grabbed Laura by her arms and pulled her close.\n\n\u201cI remember groups of elves sprung from under the tundra and then ..  I heard you scream and then it went dark.\u201d\n\nLaura responded to Johns pull with a deep hung and a passionate kiss.\n\n\u201cYes, there no time, we need to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are we, how long has it been.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn, no,\u201d\n\n\u201cLaura I want answers. Please\u2019\u201d.\n\nChristmas carols and childish laughter could be heard outside of the room.\n\n\u201cIll explain later.\u201d Laura grabbed Johns hand.\n\n\u201cHow did you escape?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo time.\u201d\n\nThe colorful bright corridors were large and spacious outside of the prison room. The sound of toy making, machinery and child laughter was paranormal and haunting. Sneaking behind boxes of toys, clothes and general gifts. Laura pointed to a large green metal door with 3 gold bolts spread down the middle with a large red Christmas tree painted in the center of the door.\n\n\u201cInside that room is the portal. We have to destroy it and then we can leave.\u201d\n\nBefore John could respond she tugged his hand and kept a low profile and opened the door, jolted through, locking the door on the other side with a large key pulled from her stocking.\n\n\u201cThis is it. We have..\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on? Where are we? How long have we been here?\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn, there isn\u2019t time.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn it, Laura. I want answers!\u201d\n\nLaura was caught off guard by John\u2019s fervor.\n\n\u201cWhats the last thing you remember? The Artic Tundra? The elves springing up and then you were lights out?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d John responds controlling his breathing.\n\n\u201cWell for starters, they captured us and they fed us cookies and other Christmas confectionaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cCookies?\u201d John asked bewildered.\n\n\u201cThere not cookies, nothing in the world they feed us is what it seems to be. The eggnog, candy canes, are all some kind of magic or science beyond our understanding. It brain washes you, it alter your behavior enslaving you, and even sustains you at the cellular level.\u201d\n\n\u201cCellular level? Laura\u2026. How long.\u201d\n\n\u201c500 hundred years . Look at you.\u201d Laura pulls out a polished mirror and turns it to John.\n\n\u201cYour 300 pounds, white hair, dressed in red and 535 years old. But you look like your in your 30\u2019s. Obese but in your 30\u2019s.\u201d\n\nJohn held his hands over his face trying to process what he was looking at.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if we make it out alive, your physical appearance will return.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get free?\u201d John grabbed Laura.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I did\u2019nt react well to their foods from the beginning and ended up faking much of the experience. Studying, this place and learning what I could from other prisoners and an elf who gave me this stocking. He\u2019s helping us ans is the reason why there is no one in the hallways or in this control room.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been faking this for 500 years?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, its only been 5 months for us but because were in a time dilation between realities, we exist in a different time and space entirely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2019 get it Laura, why is this happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook John, my husband. We are out of time, we are in this room to open a portal into our world. Which is 500 years into the future for us. And if we don\u2019t leave now, we are as good as dead.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Lights began flickering in the room and fields of electrical current stretched through the air. Whirling wind and screams of children could be heard from outside of the door. As the door was being pounded on reindeer hooves could be heard to the haunting melody of Christmas carols.\n\nLaura reached into her bag and threw John who was already losing weight sparkingly red ribbon.\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with this\u201d John\u2019s voice was muted in the wind \u201cWHAT IS THIS?\u201d he shouted.\n\nReindeer antlers began peircing the door. Mint colored axes were cutting away at the hinges.\n\n\u201cUse it to find me on the other side\u201d Laura was voice was just audible enough for John to hear her but he still didn\u2019t understand her throught he whirling wind storm. \n\nThe portal thunderously opened just as the door exploded open. Splinters of woods flew in all directions. Laura ran and tried pushing John into the portal with one hand, the other shaking a rounded object taking from her stocking. \n\n\u201cNot without you Laura.\u201d Yelled John.\n\n\u201cGo on, John! Ill meet you on the other side.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaura if I go through without you, I may be decades older then you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen wait John.\u201d\n\nThe reindeer led by a reindeer with a glowing red nose spread out and ran to and up the walls. The elves were joyously and violently laughing as they in cluster barged into the control room with weapons in hand as the sound of christmas carols and slay bells were now deafening.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t leave yet.\u201d Luara turns around and shook the snow globe in her hand and threw to the menac ing throng of elves as rein deer leap to her from the ceiling.\n\n\u201cNow we can go.\u201d \n\nThe snow globe wobbles then shakes violently. John wrapped his arms around  Luara  and pulled her into the portal as they watched the snow globe explode desecrating everything in the room. The red nose reindeer dove through the portal but not before the explosion disintegrated his body leaving just the head with  a red fading flicking light on his nose. On the other side of the portal John held Laura tightly.\n\n\u201cWe made it.. Laura. We made it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe small elf gave me a weapon to close the gate. The alternative dimension. I did just that and now we are free but we are still 500 years in the future.\u201d Laura explained catching her breathe.\n\nJohn looks at the head of the reindeer lying on a gravel road beside a small body of water somewhere in a forest.\n\n\u201cWhere are we Laura?\u201d\n\nLaura reaches into her stocking.\n\n\u201cNothing, inside anymore. I don\u2019t know. But what I do know, is that we are finally free. Your even back to normal now.\u201d Laura nudeges hhis belly with her elbow.\n\nJohn walked to the lake and looked at this reflection. He studied his body, his gray beard in the moonlight. As he studied his reflection, he saw a feint image of a sleigh being pulled by reindeer infront of the moon. In a panic he looked up.\n\n\u201cDid you see that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn front of the moonlight, I saw a sleigh being pulled by a reindeer.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible, that can\u2019t be.\u201d \n\nStanding side by side, holding each others hands, John and Luara stood both staired up  into the face of the pale moon light.",

            "comment": "I only got a few days off a year and Christmas wouldn't be one of them. You wouldn't believe the amount of magic it takes to travel that fast around the world. I've been mining the core of this planet for the magic for the past three hundred years and once a year i use half of it to blast around the world. It used to replenish the magic, people believing in it with the gifts that wouldn't happen without me. Now that technology has replaced the magic it's running out the mines are running dry soon the elves will likely anger, without the magic to maintain a quality of life. \n\nNow Christmas is here i get to go through reinforcing belief in magic and eating cookies. Some assholes have started with vegan cookies this iss a horrible trick to play on me. I  leave the gifts some believe in me but with every dying heart the magic stores replenish less and less. \n",

            "comment": "I think Saint Nicholas was the first, and that's back when Santa's were allowed to live among people all year round, with the caveat that they spend their life giving gifts to others. Saint Nick's good deeds wrote him into a legend which spread around the world like wildfire. \n\nAfter the legend spread, the elves realised that the fire had burned too big and bright, because the story was powerful, and like any powerful story, it can easily fall into the wrong hands-- hands that will twist and turn the words like yarn-- A master craftsman can make his make his material into whatever he wants. \n\nCoca-cola eventually made up their closest approximation to saint Nick wearing their brand colours, sitting in a sleigh drawn by reindeer racing through the sky. Their ad campaign sparked a ridiculous number of impersonators setting up shop in their local mall, sitting on a gaudy red throne and taking kids on their lap to whisper the name of the toys that they coveted. \n\nParents took it upon themselves go raid their local toy stores and spend their Christmas bonuses on gifts and wrapping paper.\n\n That's what I was told. And this is why I am the opposite of what the legend says. Because the workers have to keep us working. They have to keep some sort of universal force in motion, and this force is kept in motion by the spirit of generosity. The spirit of giving. This is why I can slip through walls, pass by like a cold gust. Nobody remembers my face, because I don't have one. But I have a purpose, and that purpose is to give to people something that they need. \n\nHas anything ever happened to you that you consider a \"Christmas Miracle\"? Something wonderful that happened by chance, something that can't be explained?. . Maybe it was a twenty dollars bill on the ground when you had used up your last paycheck and you felt weak with hunger.\n\nOr maybe a  kind stranger that showed up at the right time.\n\nSomeone that called an ambulance and wrapped you in their coat until it arrived. \n\nSomeone who left before you could thank them.\n\nWhat about those lights that painted the sky beautiful colours at night? \n\nThat was me.\n\nYou wouldn't remember me, only the feeling in your chest that lets you know I'm there. \nIt's a feeling of  excitement, some would describe it as the feeling of \"being a kid again\" \n\n(we focus more on helping children, sorry). \n\n That feeling of someone, somewhere out there looking after you, making sure you're okay? That's me.  \n\nand I'll always be here for you when you need me. \n\n",

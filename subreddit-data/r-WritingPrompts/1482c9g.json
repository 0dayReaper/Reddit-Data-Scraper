            "comment": "\u201cPreservation is your mandate,\u201d the priest had told Johann during his coming of age ceremony. Those words sealed his fate. He was taken from his village by the recruiter knights. He was sent to the North with a bunch of other people who had tested positive for Gifts and then he\u2019d spent the next ten years or so trying not to die while the Tusa empire tried to break the stalemate every month or so at the border. \n\nJohann\u2026got used to it. He liked to think that he was a very practical person, so he pasted a smile on his face even as he walked between the beds of the dead and dying. He never tried to think too hard, just in case he\u2019d stumble into a line of thought that he didn\u2019t want to pursue. Thinking too much got people killed out here- whether because they realized the futility of their existence or because they started having inevitably fruitless mutinous ideas against their superiors. \n\nEvery day after his shift, he\u2019d simply head back to the barracks and lie down on his bed. He didn\u2019t think about what would come in the next day or whether he\u2019d survive yet another day near the front lines. \n\nOn a full moon one night, a moth flew into the barracks. It fluttered weakly in the air, passing by the rickety bunk beds and the snoozing soldiers, landing on the only soldier who was wide awake in the dead of night. \n\nJohann reached out, almost brushing the moth off his face. He paused, feeling its wings beat weakly against his skin. He knew instinctively that the moth was about to die even though it tried its best to flutter on. \n\nHe didn\u2019t know why he did it. It didn\u2019t matter if the moth died. Insects didn\u2019t live for very long anyway. \n\nIt was sympathy, perhaps. Johann had long since forgotten how to care for anyone, even himself though. \n\nThe power of preservation glowed between his fingers, a faint golden light illuminating the fragile wings of a dying moth. The moth fluttered from his face, landing docilely on his outstretched hand. Its wings began to grow until it was twice it\u2019s original size, hooks and spurs forming on its legs. Johann\u2019s eyes glowed. He felt the faintest connection between him and the moth as it fluttered off. \n\nJohann slept so soundly that night. \n\nIt felt easier, using his power on non-human life, he realized. Bugs could be fortified. Plants as well. Microbes were even better. Johann played around with his power whenever he was alone. It was more amusing to use his power than having to speak to patients or fellow soldiers who would soon be dead anyway. \n\nThe smiling doctor, people called him. Johann seemed happier than before, although he couldn\u2019t quite explain why. \n\nIt all came to a head so suddenly that even Johann was surprised. \n\nIt happened when he was caught in an offensive. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time the field hospital had been overrun by a sudden push. Johann wasn\u2019t even that bothered anymore about having to fight his way out by sneaking around the groups of enemy soldiers. \n\nHowever this time, someone managed to shoot him just as he was fleeing the hospital. Johann wasn\u2019t afraid. As he lay bleeding on the ground and crawling away,  he just felt one thing. \n\nAngry. \n\nAll he wanted was to keep fiddling around with his power. He didn\u2019t care about their stupid war or the idiots who kept dying around him. Why did everyone have to keep messing things up for him? \n\nPreservation is a blessing, they told him. Johann didn\u2019t suppress his power. It burst out of him, a wave of golden light. He didn\u2019t use it on himself, not even on the dead and dying soldiers around him. He just let it run wild, flooding through every living organism around him. Beetles and butterflies sprang out of the nearby grass, metamorphosing into larger creatures of spike and claw. The plants began to morph, bristling with glistening thorns and flowers that bloomed upon corpses. \n\nShouts and screams rang out from soldiers on both sides but Johann didn\u2019t care even as a moth fluttered over and landed in his chest. Scaled wings and bloodied petals grew inside of him and Johann\u2026 \n\nJohann laughed and laughed, staggering to his feet as the battlefield bloomed.",

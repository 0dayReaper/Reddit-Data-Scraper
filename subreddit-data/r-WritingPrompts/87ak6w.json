            "comment": "I awoke to the quorking of ravens.  The fact that I knew that sound meant ravens, or even what quorking was, surprised me, but didn't concern me.  Nor did the fact I couldn't quite remember where I was or what I had been doing.  That too, should've concerned me but, pleasantly, didn't.  It felt like I was waking from a long nap, a bit foggy but refreshed.  The ravens flapped and hopped around their perch in a way that seemed to indicate confusion or argument and, for a time, I just watched them.  It was some time before I realized there was someone else in the room, or space, or where ever this was.  A hooded old man, also observing the ravens with something approaching paternal concern was turned away from me.  I tried to clear my throat politely but the sound echoed impossibly and all three figures turned to regard me.  \n\n\"Greetings traveler,\" the old man said, \"You've caused my little friends here a bit of confusion.  It seems your tale is a bit unusual for my halls, so I've chosen to hear it directly.  Tell me sir, are you a warrior of your people?\"  \n\nIt didn't feel like an interrogation and somehow I wasn't scared.  It was like my grandfather had asked me about what I had for breakfast that day.  It felt right to reply, and suddenly memory became clear.  \n\n\"Uh...sir, no...not a warrior.  Actually, farthest thing from it by most peoples way of thinking - I'm just a cook.\"  I felt this would somehow end the dream, or whatever this was, or the man would be unimpressed, but he wasn't.  If anything, he seemed to be smiling.  \n\n\"That explains this,\" a dented, scratched spatula appeared in the mans hand.  Memory seemed to awake at the sight.\n\n\"Yes!  That's mine!  I mean, well, the one I always use.  I guess it's my favorite, as much as a spatula can be.  I was using it just a little while ago, making....what was I making?  I'm sorry, I can't remember.\"  I felt the need to apologize to this figure, although I wouldn't be able to tell you why.  He seemed familiar, somehow, like a relative I hadn't seen in years.  \n\n\"Don't bother yourself with worry, traveler.  Why don't you take up your favorite...spatula, and tell me of your...labors with it.\"  The old man offered the spatula to me, handle first, carefully, almost tenderly, like it was precious and fragile.  I reached out a hand to touch it and felt a flash of memory.  \n\n\"I...I was in the...cafeteria...Yes, that's where I was.  I work for the district and was making lunch.  Chicken tenders and tater-tots, green beans, apple sauce, even a little salad.  It's good for the kids to have good food to eat, don't you think?  I always loved working with the kids and the district was kind enough to give me a job, even though I had a record.\" \n\nIt felt natural to say this to the old man.  He was feeling more like a long missed friend so sharing with him was comfortable...easy. \n\n\"A cook, for children?  That was your task?  Your role amongst your people?\"  The question wasn't delivered with malice or derision, the old man wasn't mocking me or being cruel.  If anything, he seemed..surprised, maybe even a little impressed.  \n\n\"Yes, I love working with the children.  Little Cheryl and Tommy and Franz were always nice to me, always tried to tell me jokes.  I made sure to give them extra tater-tots - they love tater-tots.  They even made me some macaroni art!  I hung it up behind the counter so I could see it every day.\"  The children.  Something about the children.  Something horrifying was crawling at the edge of my memories.  The children were in danger! The old man must've seen panic on my face.\n\n\"Peace, traveler, the children are safe,\" The old man put a hand on my arm and I instantly felt a peaceful calm return, \"tell me of this day, friend, then we can go from this place.\"  \n\n\"Today?  Normal day I guess.  Spilled tea on myself getting ready, had to change my shirt and almost clocked in late.  I was just getting ready for lunch when I started hearing something from upstairs.  I didn't think the kids were doing a field day and the banging was so loud.  I went to look out and kids were already running down the stairs, screaming and crying...\" I could feel tears of my own forming at the memory...\"I saw Tommy and Franz holding Cheryl...trying to push their hands against her side, already slick with blood.  Tommy was missing a chunk of his right ear but didn't seem to care, he was holding onto Cheryl as hard as a 7 year old could.  He was so brave, even as the other kids ran in every direction.\"  The memory was an avalanche now.  The screams of panicked adults and terrified children.  The smell of blood and gun powder.  The thunder of the shots getting closer. I remembered.\n\n\"I...I took them into the freezer, in the back of the cafeteria.  Tommy, Franz, Cheryl....all the kids I could find.  I found the big first aid kit we always keep in the cafeteria and yanked it off the wall to throw into the freezer with them and told them not to open the door, no matter what.  Then I broke the handle and I think...\" my memory ended with the shock of impact, of a force on my back and a sudden red stain on the freezer door.  Understanding slowly unfolded in my mind.  \n\nThe old man stood silent for a long time.  The ravens had taken to his shoulders at some point and all were looking at me intently.  It was only now that I realized the old man, face hidden in shadow, seemed to have a patch over one eye.  He also had a tear running down his face.  \n\n\"I see now why my little friends were confused, traveler.  Midgard has changed greatly since I last walked there and with it, so has the shape of battle.  Thankfully, what hasn't changed is the stout heart of man.\"  The old man seemed to be drawing himself up, getting impossibly big and powerful looking.  In the distance, horns blared.  \"Listen, friend, the horns of my hall are sounded for you.  You have a place among the honored dead here.  You fell upon a field that should never have been a battleground, defending those who should never need be warriors.  You showed the bravery of long ages past and when you did, you held this in your hand.\"\n\nThe final memory blossomed in my mind.  I had used the spatula to break the handle, that's why it was dented and scratched.  Something new blossomed there.  I could see minutes later, help arriving, the freezer being forced open, medics attending the survivors.  \n\nEven little Cheryl.  \n\nI saw a memorial in the cafeteria, candles and flowers.  I saw drawings of crayon and sparkles, thank yous and prayers, Cheryl walking slowly, still bandaged, crying, laying another piece of macaroni art on the pile.  In the middle, on a small stand, was the spatula.  My spatula.\n\nI turned to the old man, who I now knew as if he was my father.  He indicated a direction and we began walking together towards his distant hall as his ravens took flight, quorking to themselves contentedly.  \n\n\nEdit 1:  I am stunned and humbled by the response this has elicited, especially from folks who work with or at schools themselves.  Thank you all.  I will try to respond to all the comments I can individually, and will thank all the folks who were generous enough to gild this directly as soon as I can.  I'm also integrating the very helpful feedback from a few folks who noticed I drifted into the 3rd person a few times.  \n\nEdit 2:  A few people have asked if I had a subreddit, so I've decided to condense all the prompts I've responded to over here - https://www.reddit.com/r/SpecialistSix/.  I hope a few that didn't get much traction the first time around get some new readers.  \n\nEdit 3:  Check out /u/NachosGalore [reading of the piece](https://soundcloud.com/anartiesaysmoo/spatula/s-MVmlN) - I think it's great!

The fear can be so palpable that it\u2019s almost like a thick fog you have to walk through day in and day out. \n\nBut your story, after making me ugly cry in bed trying not to wake up my wife, made me think about all the everyday heroes out there that do tremendous acts of kindness and bravery every day. It helped me remember that there\u2019s always hope and as long as one person is willing to fight, maybe we can all join in and overcome. It reminded me that just because it\u2019s scary, terrifying even, there are those who need protection and it\u2019s up to those who can offer them that protection to step up and offer it. \n\nWill your story fully change my life? Maybe, maybe not. But for not now, in this moment, your story has made my world a little bit brighter and for that, I thank you. ",

            "comment": "\"Will the deceased please rise.\"\n\nI stood. The court of Asgard was quite intimidating. Odin presided with Thor arguing against us.  \"As you can see,\" Thor said \"This is no weapon, merely a cooking implement. Like any other, surely we wouldn't let any hero with a spoon into Valhalla now will we?\"\n\nThe crowd in the courtroom laughed. My lawyer stood \"Objection your honor, speculation.\" The lawyer adjusted his suit, when your soul was on the line, the best lawyer would do. Loki smiled and raised his arms in a plaintive gesture. \"At least I don't think we've ruled that spoons aren't weapons.\"\n\nOdin peered down with his one good eye. \"Mmm sustained, no precedent has yet been set for spoons.\"\n\n\"Withdrawn... father.\" \n\n\"Tell me, if the prosecution thinks a spatula isn't a weapon, what exactly is a weapon?\" Loki asked baiting the trap.\n\n\"Why, it's a tool meant to defend oneself of course. Staves, swords,\" Thor smiled and raised his hammer Mj\u00f6lnir above him \"And hammers.\" The crowd hooted at the sight of the legendary weapon. \n\n\"So anything that you use to defend yourself you say. What about from non corporal threats, like magic for example, threats to ones survival of all types would seem to count correct?\"\n\nThor thought for a moment. \"Yes I suppose a charm could count as a weapon. Protection from magic is self defense.\"\n\n\"So would protecting yourself from existential threats then count? Like starvation, if you can't feed yourself you are in jeopardy. Can a weapon be used to feed yourself?\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" Thor exclaimed \"I have often used my hammer on hunts.\"\n\n\"Ah HA!\" Loki exclaimed \"So therefore using a spatula to prevent your starvation makes it a weapon?\"\n\nThor looked confused, \"That's obviously not what I meant.\"\n\n\"Stenographer please read back what Thor just said in response to my last question?\" Loki asked with an ingratiating tone. \n\n\"Ok let's see, Loki: Can a weapon be used to feed yourself. Thor: Indeed. Shall I continue?\"\n\n\"Thank you, that'll be all stenographer,\" Loki replied. \"So by the prosecutions own logic a spatula, used to feed oneself and protect from starvation is in fact a weapon.\"\n\n\"Your honor the defense is willfully misinterpreting my statement. Surely you must see this.\"\n\n\"Do not presume to tell me what I see Thor Odinson...\" Odin replied in a booming voice. \"I rule in favor of the defense. A spatulla can be used as a weapon.\"\n\nI stood and pumped my fist, \"YES! Valhalla here I come.\"\n\n\"On the condition,\" Odin continued \"That you use this weapon come Ragnarok.\"\n\n\"I... uh,\" I studdered\n\n\"Take the deal\" Loki whispered. \"You just have to fight a giant snake with the other heroes. You won't even have to do anything.\"\n\n\"Very well, I accept this deal. I shall save the world.\" I smirked, \"With a spatula.\"",

Loki's role in Ragnarok is as the catalyst more than the doom itself, and as it is a familial struggle, he sides with his children against those who fought his kin. It's a pretty tragic tale really, since almost everyone who fights ends up dying alongside the person they were trying to kill.

Sure, he was annoying and pulled some of the stupidest pranks (like taking Sif's hair), but things would always work out for the best in the end and he'd _still_ be punished for it.\n\nLoki however was the perpetual outsider among the gods. He wanted to be appreciated but whenever something went wrong Thor would threaten to take his head. With the very hammer that Loki was instrumental in the creation of (because of the aforementioned stealing of Sif's hair, whoops!). They always jumped to 'we're going to fucking kill you for this (relatively harmless for a god) prank if you don't fix it'. \n\nSo then he sees this guy who's basking in all this love and appreciation and everyone's going on about how fucking great he is while there's Loki who has done a lot of great things along with his bad and well, he's just fucking done with it. Hell, these assholes killed one of his wives, banished two of his children and bound the third and they didn't even stop there.\n\nAs the stories go on Loki just seems to grow more and more petty with time til it escalates in Baldur's death, the whole rant he goes on (where he incidentally stabs another poor bastard at the banquet) and then as punishment because they _can't kill Loki_ as he's Odin's blood brother they _kill his sons_. Well, turn one into a wolf and have him murder the other.\n\nNot that Loki's a good guy, it was still petty as fuck, but there was a lot of build up to it.",

An eternity of soft clouds, harp playing, and just praising the Lord.  For all eternity.\"\n\n\"A Lord,\" Buddha suggested, \"There are more than one, stop hogging the Lordiness.\"\n\n\"Harp playing and clouds,\" I said, interested, \"What else is there?\"\n\n\"That's it!\" St. Peter announced proudly.\n\n\"Hard pass,\" I said holding my hand up as his face dropped, \"Next.  What about you.\"  My finger was pointing at who was obviously Satan.\n\n\"Party's all day.  Liquor that flows like a river.  Gambling 24 hours a day,\" He said this all non-nonchalantly and my face brightened.\n\n\"What he doesn't mention,\" said Buddha, \"The Party is attended by the people you hate the most, the liquor is Miller Lite, and you always lose while gambling.\"\n\n\"Buddha!\" Satan said simply, \"Remind me to sneak snakes into your bed.\"\n\n\"Another hard pass,\" I told Satan and he deflated, \"What about you Buddha?\"\n\n\"I offer nothing,\" the Buddha said, \"For I am perfectly content.\"\n\n\"Content to screw up everyone's sales pitches, you rotund son of a...\" Satan mumbled.\n\n\"Enough!\" This huge warrior yelled and everyone jumped, \"Send this puny fool to some afterlife full of sissies and wimps.  He is unworthy of Valhalla.\"\n\n\"What's that supposed to mean,\" I said, standing in my chair and bristling, \"What's so great about Valhalla?\"\n\n\"Puny fool,\" the warrior said, \"I represent Odin the one-eyed.  Even with two eyes I can see you are unworthy.  Valhalla is for warriors who died with a weapon in hand in the heat of battle.  In its hallowed halls you drink mead all day long and speak of battles past.  You begin the day with a fight and end with a fight.  It is for men.\"\n\nI looked at Buddha expectantly.  He just shrugged, continued smiling, \"It's true. Alcohol all day long and lusty Valkyries by your side.\"\n\n\"I want in!\" I said, slamming my hand on the table.\n\n\"You've never used a weapon in your life, coward,\" the warrior laughed and I was enraged.\n\n\"I'll have you know I died with the greatest weapon of my age in my hand...\"  I was just talking at this point.  What did I die doing again?  Oh yeah, heart attack scrambling eggs after binge watching Netflix.\n\n\"That weapon being?\" the warrior asked, raising a giant bushy eyebrow.\n\n\"A spatula!\" I said, looking around the room.\n\n\"But a spatula is...\" a round face started.\n\n\"One more word, Buddha, and I'll wipe the contentment off your face.\"  I yelled and the warrior laughed.\n\n\"And you killed with this weapon?\"  the warrior asked, judging my next words carefully.\n\n\"Many men,\" I said simply, telling him the truth.  You see, there was no lying in these hallowed halls.\n\n\"We leave for Valhalla in the morning, brave warrior.\" he told me, clapping me on the shoulder so hard I cringed.  The room emptied of grumbling eternal salesman.\n\n\"I do not understand,\" the Buddha said, raising an eyebrow, \"A spatula is not a weapon.  How did you kill many men with it?\"\n\n\"I was a fry cook for 30 years at the grungiest diner you ever saw,\" I grinned, \"If the food poisoning didn't get them, the hardened arteries did.\"\n\nBuddha grinned. \n",

Look at his frail limbs and tiny body. How many frost giants have you slain?\"\n\n\"Uh, none,\" the young man stammered out. \n\n\"How many of your foes have you deceived in order to turn the tide of war?\" Loki asked behind steepled fingers.\n\n\"I don't really like lying,\" the young man answered.\n\n\"And what of that weapon in your hand? How many lives has that taken? How many trophies have you carved from the bodies of the fallen?\"\n\n\"Well it doesn't really do any of that.\"  \n\n\"Does it have any mystical properties? Perhaps it returns when you throw it?\" Thor asked caressing his hammer.\n\nThe young man shook his head no.\n\n\"Then why are you here? What can you possibly do to earn your place here among the greatest heroes of all time?\"\n\nThe young man thought for a moment and hefted the metal spatula.  \n\n\"It does have a power. Something that very few things can possess,\" he paused and met the eyes of the gods sitting in front of him.\n\n\"It has the power to slay hunger!\" he roared and thrust the spatula into the air.\n\nOdin slammed his hands down on the table, thunder tore through the chamber shaking the young man violently.  A small smile spread across his lips and his chest began to heave.  Laughter bubbled up from inside of Odin and he found himself gripping his sides trying to contain his laughter.  He wiped away a lone tear that streaked down his wrinkled cheek.  \n\n\"Ah, my boy. It has been too long since I have laughed like that. It brings me great pleasure,\" he paused stifling another bout of laughter, \"To banish you to Hel.\"\n\nThe floor beneath the young man's feet vanished sending him plummeting through darkness to Hel waiting below.\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading!

            "comment": "FADE IN:\n\nINT. A CORPORATE BOARDROOM \u2013 DAY\n\n*Several men and women in suits sit around a large table, all of them looking bored. At the front of the room, a man with a white beard flicks at the black eyepatch that he wears. This is ODIN.*\n\n**ODIN:** You know, I was supposed to get the wisdom of the ages.\n\n*Halfhearted murmurs are offered by everyone at the table.*\n\n**ODIN:** (*CONT'D*) There I was, thinking I'd be granted some kind of sublime knowledge. Do you know what I got?\n\n*A blond-haired man with a neatly trimmed beard sighs. This is THOR.*\n\n**THOR:** A bunch of old wives' tales and some herbal remedies?    \n**ODIN:** A bunch of old... hey!    \n**THOR:** And when you asked for a refund, Mimir told you to...\n\n*A breathtakingly beautiful woman \u2013 SIF \u2013 interrupts.*\n\n**SIF:** (*Interrupting*) He told you to go sit on a glacier.    \n**ODIN:** Now, look, if you people are just going to...\n\n*A sudden flash of light interrupts Odin. When the room's illumination returns to normal, a very confused young man is revealed. This is DAVE. He is clad in a pink apron and is clutching a black spatula.*\n\n**ODIN:** (*CONT'D*) ... huh. That hasn't happened in a while.    \n**DAVE:** Yeah, I'm reasonably certain that pancakes aren't normally supposed to do that.    \n**SIF:** Do what?    \n**DAVE:** I'm not sure. What just happened?\n\n*A middle-aged woman grins with glee. This is HEL.*\n\n**HEL:** You died!    \n**DAVE:** I think I'd remember that.    \n**THOR:** No, that's definitely what happened.\n\n*Dave glances around.*\n\n**DAVE:** Heaven looks really boring.    \n**THOR:** This is Valhalla.    \n**DAVE:** Valhalla looks really boring. Why am I in Valhalla?    \n**ODIN:** Good question. Only warriors who die in battle are supposed to come here.    \n**DAVE:** You must get a lot of soldiers, then.    \n**SIF:** Actually, no, we don't. See, you *don't* have to die in battle; you have to die holding a weapon.    \n**DAVE:** Soldiers carry guns! Guns are weapons!    \n**HEL:** Not according to Section Nine, Paragraph Four of the Valhalla Bylaws!\n\n*Everyone in the room save for Dave and Hel groans with impatience.*\n\n**DAVE:** The what?    \n**THOR:** Don't encourage her.    \n**HEL:** According to our charter, a weapon is an object which renders injury or death.    \n**DAVE:** ... So, a gun?    \n**HEL:** No, a bullet.    \n**DAVE:** That seems like a remarkably stupid technicality.    \n**THOR:** *You're* a remarkably stupid technicality!    \n**ODIN:** He might be, actually.\n\n*All eyes in the room turn to face Odin.*    \n\n**SIF:** Huh?    \n**ODIN:** Well, what's that in his hand?    \n**DAVE:** It's a spatula.    \n**ODIN:** I know it's a spatula... but what *is* it?    \n**THOR:** ... A spatula.    \n**ODIN:** You're not getting it. What *is* a spatula?    \n\n*A sudden thought seems to occur to Dave.*\n\n**DAVE:** Hang on! Why does Valhalla look like an office building?    \n**HEL:** We had to redefine a pen as weapon a few decades ago.    \n**DAVE:** Because it's mightier than the sword?    \n**HEL:** Because a disgruntled accountant stabbed his coworker with one.    \n**DAVE:** Oh. I take it he lost that fight.    \n**THOR:** He...    \n**DAVE:** (*Interrupting*) Since he died, I mean.    \n**THOR:** He actually slipped and hit his head while running away.    \n**SIF:** He wouldn't stop screaming, so we redesigned Valhalla to make him calm down.    \n**DAVE:** And... what? You just kept it this way?    \n**HEL:** (*Shrugging*) Eh.\n\n*Odin slams his fist on the table.*\n\n**ODIN:** Enough! I swear, you people will drone on about the dullest things!    \n**THOR:** (*Muttering*) You mean like trading your eye for a chicken soup recipe?    \n**ODIN:** Now, for the last time: What is a spatula?\n\n*Several seconds of silence pass.*\n\n**THOR:** It's...    \n**ODIN:** (*Interrupting*) Don't say \"a spatula.\"    \n**THOR:** Well, it is.    \n**SIF:** You mean... are you asking if it counts as a weapon?    \n**ODIN:** Finally! Yes.    \n**THOR:** You could have been direct about it.     \n**ODIN:** (*In a mocking voice*) \"You could have been direct about it.\" Shut up.    \n**THOR:** You're an ass.    \n**HEL:** I think it counts as a weapon.    \n**SIF:** Odin's ass?    \n**THOR:** Only after taco night.    \n**HEL:** *The spatula!*   \n**SIF:** Is it forged from celestial iron or something?\n\n*Dave examines his spatula.*\n\n**DAVE:** No, I think it's just plastic.    \n**HEL:** It counts! It can render injury or death!    \n**DAVE:** Hey, my pancakes aren't *that* bad!    \n**HEL:** We are not concerned with your pancakes; we're talking about the spatula.    \n**SIF:** Do you ever say a word so often that it starts to sound funny?    \n**THOR:** Spa-tu-la.    \n**ODIN:** Spa-tuuuuu-la.    \n**SIF:** Spaaaaa-tu-la.    \n**DAVE:** (*Shouting*) Confused! *Confused!*\n\n*Dave closes his eyes and starts waving his spatula in front of him. It smacks on the top of Odin's head several times.*\n\n**ODIN:** Ow! Ow! Stop it! Stop it! Ow!    \n**HEL:** There! See?! That's an injury!\n\n*Dave stops flailing and opens one eye.*\n\n**DAVE:** Oh, god, sorry, I...    \n**THOR:** (*Interrupting*) Odin.    \n**DAVE:** What?    \n**ODIN:** What?    \n**THOR:** No, not... ugh. He said \"god.\" That's the other guy.    \n**SIF:** Technically, it's an unspecified deity. You're thinking of Jehovah.    \n**HEL:** It's \"Yeshua\" now.    \n**THOR:** No, that's his son. We go drinking on Tuesdays.    \n**ODIN:** When *don't* you go drinking? Lazy layabout.\n\n*Thor snatches the spatula from Dave and brandishes it at Odin.*\n\n**THOR:** You want to go, old man? Huh?    \n**SIF:** (*To Hel*) Huh, look at that. I guess you're right.    \n**HEL:** That settles it. The spatula is a weapon.\n\n*Odin snatches the spatula from Thor and whacks him over the head with it.*\n\n**ODIN:** Any more like that out of you, and you're grounded!    \n\n*Thor sits back and sulks. Odin turns the spatula over in his hands a few times.*\n\n**ODIN:** (*CONT'D*) I mean... I guess. Sure, why not? It's better than that stupid pen.    \n**HEL:** That was plastic, too, by the way.\n\n*Odin hands the spatula back to Dave, who looks uncertain.*\n\n**DAVE:** So, uh... does that mean I'm staying?    \n**HEL:** It looks that way.    \n**SIF:** Yeah, welcome to Valhalla, I guess.    \n**DAVE:** Great. Now that everything is cleared up, I just have one question.    \n**THOR:** The bathroom is down the hall.    \n**DAVE:** Huh? Oh, no, thanks, but I was actually curious about something else.    \n**ODIN:** What troubles you, warrior?\n\n*Dave takes a deep breath.*\n\n**DAVE:** How the hell did I even die?!\n\n*Hel takes out her smartphone and scrolls through something.*\n\n**HEL:** It looks like the batter mix you used was contaminated... with cyanide.    \n**DAVE:** ... That seems incredibly unlikely.    \n**HEL:** Well, that's what happened.    \n**THOR:** I guess your pancakes *were* that bad!\n\n*Dave stares at Thor for a moment, then whacks him with the spatula.*\n\nCUT TO BLACK.",

The man was indeed large, but not in the physical sense. Important. Wizened, for sure, yet there seemed an energy about him. Apparently, he was also grumpy. His one eye looked down dully, as if expected to contemplate the life of an ant or a slug. It was so cold, numbing. Frozen.\n\n\"Pah, ha!\" the man spat with a laugh. \"Clever, as always. Though I half expect you have something to do with this, Loki.\"\n\n\"It is always Loki,\" grumbled another man, much younger and thicker of beard. \"A spatula is a tool of housewives! Kitchen warriors! Send him back to Hel, noone is welcome in Valhalla if calling such a 'weapon'.\"\n\nThe room began to shake. A tall, beautiful woman wearing a colorful amulet stood and glared at the younger man, prompting him to sit and grumble. \"Tell your son to mind his tongue, or I'll have it out,\" she said, forcefully. She played with the amulet at her neck as the sunlight fell about her, giving full display of her figure and form. The urge to blush bubbled deep within, but it was as if everything in me was also at standstill, stagnant. I couldn't even move. \"Just because he's a dolt doesn't mean the rest of us need to be soiled with his nonsense.\" \n\nThe old man locked his eye with hers while a low chuckle eminated from behind me, as if I was the only to hear it. \"We shall resolve this tomorrow. There has already been enough 'debate' today.\" Without further adieu, sounds of the hall emptying echoed off the walls, apparently having been quite full. The young man and the woman with the necklace stepped down and out without speaking. After it was quiet, the old man approached, stepping slowly but decidedly.\n\n\"Well, isn't that peculiar?\" he seemed to ask the empty room. \"Are you awake in there?\" He grabbed a flask from his belt and took a swig. After a gulp, he breathed slowly into my mouth. The stiffness dissipated and I collapsed to watch my skin turn from palest of pale blue to healthy and normal. My feeling returned.\n\n\"Aaahh aaaargh.\" My voice apparently hadn't.\n\n\"It'll take some time. My great hall is not quite what you may be used to. The rules here are very different than where you are from.\"\n\nI nodded, I could feel the sunlight fall, it was quite the beautiful day, it turns out.\n\n\"You've caused a stir. You'd expect we'd have been visited by a j\u00f6ttun or a troll, or something. And, yet, a dead human draws a crowd.\"\n\n\"Arha?\"\n\n\"Well, it's not every day Hel requests our opinion on whether an exception be made. Truth be told, she's usually quite cold.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\n\"Something is *wrong* in Asgard, little human. The Vanir and Aesir are tense. It is almost like the old days, and that would be good for no one. War? Pah, there are more pressing concerns and to be torn apart now? I couldn't bear it. And your realm wouldn't survive it.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"I need your help, human. Someone like you is too small to notice here. Help me piece my kingdom back together. Succeed, and I'll advise Hel to let you go.\"",

            "comment": "As I approached the bench, still wearing my bloodstained apron and Smashburger uniform, the imposing and powerful Norse God stares down upon me. His advisors, left and right of him, pinched their gazes all directly before me. \n\n\u201cMORTAL,\u201d he said in a voice that vaguely resembled thunder, \u201cYOU STAND BEFORE US, A COURT OF WARRIORS, AS A FUCKING FRY COOK. EXPLAIN WHY YOU BELONG AMONGST US.\u201d\n\nThey living often claim that the other side of things, things being the afterlife, lend perspective. Unfortunately, their only source of people they divulge this from is the dying, the dying having lived a full and fruitful life. I, on the other hand, am a 22 year old fry cook from Jersey. I had no tidbits of wisdom that could possibly help me in this situation. Nonetheless, what I lacked in wisdom I had surplus in nerves, so I began my arguments. \n\n\u201cSir,\u201d I calmly began, \u201cI am to understand that in order to enter this realm of the afterlife, I was to have died with weapon in hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cCORRECT YOU ARE MORTAL.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have reason to claim that I died with a weapon in my hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cA SPATULA? A SPATULA?!?!?\u201d\n\nAs he bellowed, clouds overcame the high ceiling court room. Rain fell upon the stone floor and the high bench of Odin and his council. It seemed evermore imposing and I nonetheless cleared my throat and drew breath deep into my chest.\n\n\u201cI HAVE KILLED COUNTLESS MEN WITH MY SPATULA, AND HERE IS HOW I DID IT.\u201d I began, desperately trying to find the timbre these people seemed to speak in.\n\n\u201cWITH THIS SPATULA I CREATED THE INEVITABLE DEATH OF MY CUSTOMERS.  MUCH LIKE THE BOW IS TO THE ARROW, MY SPATULA WAS TO THE BURGER. I BRED THEIR OBESITY EVERY DAY. THEY CAME UPON ME, THEIR HUNGER CLOUDING THEIR JUDGEMENT, AND EVERY DAY I CHIPPED AWAY AT THEIR STRENGTH.\u201d\n\nA murmur came from high up on the bench, whispers of interest, confusion... wonder, even.\n\nI MADE THEM FAT- MADE THEM WEAK. I POISONED THEIR INSIDES WITH SATURATED FATS AND SALT UNTIL ONE DAY, THEY FELL: DEAD OF A HEART ATTACK. THOSE WHO DID NOT WERE SUBJECTED TO DISEASES OF THE FLESH THAT WOULD LEAD TO THEIR DEATHS. DIABETES, CHOLESTEROL, OBESITY: THE VERY POISONS WITH WHICH MY ARROWS WERE DIPPED.\u201d\n\n\u201cSTOOOOOOOP!\u201d A roar of thunder rolled down from the top of the bench.\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d I replied, shocking myself at my own impudence. \u201cI HAVE KILLED MORE THAN MOST WARRIORS OF MY LAND. THE BLOOD ON MY HANDS CANNOT BE IGNORED. GIVE ME MY WARRIOR\u2019S AFTERLIFE.\u201d\n\n\u201cTHEN HOW....\u201d Odin said, considerably calmer than before, \u201cDID YOU DIE?\u201d\n\nI looked up sheepishly at the advisory board and the big man himself and said, at normal volume,\n\u201cThe Smashburger was being held up. I tried to bum-rush the robber and he shot me dead. It was my chance to be a hero and despite the fact that I knew it would probably kill me, I needed to prove that in some way, I was valiant enough to stand up to a bad man for the sake of good people being terrorized. My spatula was the closest thing I had to use to fight, and even if it meant having to bludgeon him into submission with a flimsy, malleable tool, it was enough for me to find the courage to stand up against the proverbial sea of troubles.\u201d\n\nThe room fell silent. The rain cleared. Odin turned to his left and right and discussed for some considerable time and discussed the situation with his advisors. \n\nSuddenly Odin\u2019s voice redirected to me and proclaimed, \u201cRETURN TO YOUR ACCOMMODATIONS AS WE DETERMINE YOUR SITUATION.\u201d \n\nAnd so I went.\n\nThat was a week ago. This morning a guard of Odin came to my temporary afterlife condo and told me tomorrow I was to enter Valhalla. \n\nI can\u2019t believe that worked.",

I died doing battle as any true warrior should.\u201d\r\nThis speech would have sounded better if I wasn\u2019t sitting in a plastic chair. In front of me sat 5 of the most hardened warriors to ever cross into Valhalla.  In life I was a die hard atheist.  Turns out, I fucked up and gods are real.. No other god would have me because I wasn\u2019t one of the faithful. So here I am, if I can prove I am a warrior to these fine gentleman then I get to go to a happy place.  If not then the various underworlds are going to draw straws on my soul.  \r\n\u201cWhat foe where you fighting,\u201d the one in the middle grunted out.  \r\n\u201cHunger.\u201d Did I mention that I died fixing breakfast.  \r\nThey laughed.  \u201cHow is hunger a valid foe to be fighting.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure who asked.\r\nI take a breath and stand, \u201c in your lives did any of you ever truly defeat hunger or did you only ever press back its attacks.\u201d  They blinked.  \u201cMy goal wasn\u2019t a temporary victory.  I wanted domination.  I wanted to make hunger cry all the way back to its mommy.\u201d\r\nThey laughed.\r\n\u201cSo what weapon did the noble warrior use,\u201d the one on the left asked.\r\n\u201cI was using a tempered steel spatula with a carbon fiber grip. It had an ergonomic grip allowing me to hold on to it no matter how slippery it got in battle.\u201d\r\nThey looked at each other and nodded their appriciation.\r\n\u201cSo how did you die. \u201c\r\n\u201cHe must have been planning his attack for months.  One second I\u2019m standing there caring out my battle plan when I\u2019m engulfed in flames.\u201d\r\nThey nod at a warrior off to the side. He comes over, grabs my arm and literally drags me out of the room.  \r\nIn a flash I\u2019m standing on a field of green grass across from me are thousands of warriors in various armors and carrying weapons from sticks to modern military rifles.  I look down.  I\u2019m in a checkered bathrobe holding a spatula.  Fuck me. \r\n \r\n\r\n",

            "comment": "\"You may not enter the sacred hall of warriors!\" Thor boomed at me, clad in my jammies and 'Kiss the Cook' apron. \"Only true heroes who perished in the field of battle may join us.\"\n\nIt was a little jarring, really. There I was, cooking breakfast, and suddenly I end up... here. I'm not sure what to make of all of this, but if this club is exclusive, I'll definitely swindle my way in.\n\n\"And who are you to decide what the field of battle is, Mr. Winghat?\" I called out to Thor who was obviously very unhappy with this scrawny, balding man standing before him. \"Who's to say that the kitchen is not the most dangerous battlefield, and hunger is the most relentless enemy? What is the rule, exactly?\"\n\nThor growled, \"You must be a warrior and...\"\n\n\"Wrong, Thor.\" The eldest and most intimidating man, Odin, spoke. \"The rule for Valhalla is you must die wielding a weapon. Now,\" Odin addressed me, \"do you meet this requirement to join us in everlasting glory?\"\n\nWhat was I holding? Think man, think! I was making breakfast. Was is poptarts? Cereal? Eggs? Wait! I was making pancakes and pancakes requires... a spatula. Great.\n\n\"O Great and Righteous Odin, grand ruler of Valhalla, I believe I am worthy of entry.\" Shmoozing will definitely help my case.\n\n\"With what weapon?\" Thor inquired, clearly tired of my antics. \"You were wielding a plastic flipper! A spatula! Why, you couldn't couldn't even hurt a deathly ill man! That is not a weapon.\"\n\nI scoff. I already know I can win this. \"On the contrary, Thor, I would like to argue that the spatula is a weapon of great power!\" This is going to be easy. I hold the spatula aloft. \"Behold, the awesome might of my weapon!\"\n\nReadying myself, I charge forward, lifting the cheap, plastic tool above my head. Nearing my target, I strike!\n\nFWAP\n\nThe spatula sweeps across Loki's face, who until now had just been watching the discussion with idle bemusement, leaving a clean, red mark across his slender face. His face of bewilderment was exactly what I had hoped for.\n\n\"As you can see, O wonderful Odin,\" I began, quickly receeding from Loki, \"The spatula has the great power of confusion! While used on creatures of moderate size does little lasting damage, it will leave them befuddled, opening up for a strike of greater strength! Not only that, but it can crush small creatures under its wide face!\"\n\nLoki, though utterly pissed, took amusement from this, heightened by Thor boiling rage. \"I have felt this first-hand, Father. It is a fine weapon.\"\n\n\"Wha... bu... You..!\" Thor sputtered.\n\nOdin silenced everyone with his hand. \"Young man, you have gall to strike my son, Loki. Your argument is compelling. Very well, you may be granted entry into Valhalla.\"",

            "comment": "He held the weapon up to the light.\n\n\"Yes, yes. But is this TRULY the weapon of a warrior? A true Einjerarharen should die with the blood of their enemies on their blade.\"\n\nThe quiet man standing before the gods in a set of chef's whites shrugged. \"It served well enough, up to that last one.\"\n\n\"It's so...small.\"\n\n\"Brothers and sisters, we are not here is discuss whether a weapon has value. We are here to discuss whether this warrior should enter Valhalla.\"\n\n\"Oh, give it a rest, Hilda. You know damned well we need no cooks in the Halls of glory.\"\n\n\"Says you. Personally I'd be happy if we had someone who knew how to make something more complicated than some variation of an animal stuck on a pole and rotated over a fire.\"\n\n\"I do a very nice quiche from time to time.\"\n\n\"Ooooh!\"\n\n\"Do not speak again unless spoken to, mortal, or it will go hard for you.\"\n\nAnother shrug. \"So that counts as being spoken to does it?\"\n\n\"What did I JUST SAY?\"\n\n\"You said that I should not speak unless spoken to. Was I wrong in your interpretation?\"\n\n\"Do not question the gods, you puling weakling.\"\n\n\"Technically, Thor, he DID slay fifteen warriors armed far better than he with this...object.\"\n\n\"I fail to see how. You, how could you slay such as these....three persons...with this...spatch-cu-lah?\"\n\n\"Triads. They're called Triads. Criminals who think they own all of the people in my neighborhood. As far as the spatula? You have to sharpen the edge to do the right kind of chop on certain things so you don't need to move back to the chopping block. Easier. Plus, I trained as a hibachi chef.\"\n\n\"Still, this is not the weapon of a warrior! This was\n...a kitchen boy's fight!\"\n\n\"They killed my sous chef. And they messed up my mis en place.\"\n\n\"Worthy reasons, to be sure.\"\n\n\"Pfah. Mis en place? What is this?\"\n\n\"The layout that allows you to do the work you must do without running all over the place. The tools of your work. And they messed. It. Up.\"\n\n\"Calm yourself.\"\n\n\"Calm. Calm? You sit there pretending that it's EASY to design a full menu, feed hundreds in a night while still managing a staff of twenty people, half of whom are charged up on cocaine, the other half still hungover from whatever they had the night before, the whole sweatbox a giant bottle of nerves? This isn't a godsdamned diner, this is cuisine. This is gastronomy. And either you get it right or you get it wrong, and every second counts. You sit there with your idiotic hammer and blades that haven't been properly sharpened in YEARS from the look of things and you DARE to tell me that I should CALM myself?\"\n\n\"I like him. He definitely qualifies under 'berserker'.\"\n\n\"What is this quiche thing he mentioned?\"\n\n\"Eggs cooked in a pie, as far as I can tell. With a pastry crust, often filled with other ingredients like hanging, spinach, and...\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I can see you have the Wikipedia entry open under the table, Sigrun. But what to do with him?\"\n\n\"We have, perhaps, focused improperly upon the usage of a weapon, friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, let's hear from LOKI. We all know you're just itching to contribute.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Illustrious Thor. Perhaps you could give us the definition of a warrior.\"\n\n\"He who fights for glory and honor, to defend or uphold their home and country.\"\n\n\"Is not this man's home his workplace? Sir, how many hours do you spend there?\"\n\n\"Any time I'm not sleeping, ordering food, or whatever?\"\n\n\"I should say, then, it is your home. And what are the weapons of a farmer? The sickle, the axe, the spear. We were born from farmer's glory, fellow immortals. We are the gods of hearth and home. Our daggers can be used to cut flesh or to chop wood. Hammer to build or to destroy. An axe to chop or to cleave. What is the weapon other than the extension of the will of the hand that holds it?\"\n\n\"This is a trickery, Loki.\"\n\n\"No, brother. It is logic and reason.\"\n\n\"Like I said, trickery.\"\n\n\"It is not. Watch his death. He wields his weapon as a sword. He fights them with these strange knives, used as an axe. He reaches into the throat of this one with it and cleanly removes it from this life. It is this one with the weapon that shoots tiny darts...\"\n\n\"Bullets, actually.\"\n\n\"Bullets, then...this one who strikes a final blow with this coward's weapon. As he lunges forth, he brings the weapon down and removes the offending hand at the elbow.\n\n\"His heart ceases to beat, the bodies of fifteen slain and one given a coward's reward by removing his weapon hand. And you say that simply because he wields a weapon you cannot understand or use that he should not achieve Valhalla?\"\n\n\"I can understand it fine.\"\n\n\"Prove it, brother. Wield the spatula and show your skill.\"\n\n\"I will not. A woman's weapon.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"....a weakling's weapon, Freya, is what I meant to say.\"\n\n\"Fifteen dead, one humiliated for life?\"\n\n\"You cannot trick this into reality! I have the veto and I shall use it!\"\n\n\"Then we are at an impasse, and we shall remain here until it resolves. He cannot return unless given life again by the gods, and he binds us to the place of judgement until we decide. And I shall not decide for him to go to any real except to Midgaard or to Valhalla.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Brother, you are NOT keeping us from the feast. No.\"\n\n\"Why bother? It's the same every night. No, I shall not allow him to leave just because you're hungry.\"\n\n\"You forget. You're the only one who actually LIKES the food.\"\n\n\"I for one wouldn't mind trying one of these... croissants?\"\n\n\"Yes. Something from France. The Gauls.\"\n\n\"So, can you tell us more about it, mortal?\"\n\n\"No. But I can certainly tell you everything I know about being a chef. About twenty years' worth.\"\n\n\"So, Thor, are you saying you want to sit through twenty years of... culinary training?\"\n\n\"All right. Fine. Give him his little toy back. He can return to Midgaard. If he dies as a true warrior I myself shall find him and bring him to Valhalla.\"\n\n\"And if the Master of Weapons says that this is a weapon of a warrior...?\"\n\n\"Then I shall give no objection.\"\n\n\"Excellent. I also recommend that we take a sample of this mortal's food to the All-Father. As a precedent.\"\n\n\"No! I forbid it!\"\n\n\"Oops, are ravens supposed to eat human food?\"\n\n\"Are you...you did that on purpose, Loki!\"\n\n\"My hand must have slipped. One wonders why they eat egg dishes, though. They are birds, after all.\"\n\n\"They are not chickens.\"\n\n\"True enough. Well, mortal warrior, the consensus is this: you're getting sent back. If you can figure out how to die again with a weapon in your hand you belong in Valhalla, and Junior Meathead over there won't bother putting up the red velvet rope on you. But we aren't sending you back as you died. That just isn't sporting.\"\n\n\"Wait, that's fifteen Triads....\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I should have mentioned. We are sending you back with a few Einjerarharen of your own. A dozen should do it, you think?\"\n\n\"These guys don't give up easily.\"\n\n\"Ah. Perhaps thirty, then. And as a punishment for your sin, you must teach them all the way of the Chef.\"\n\n\"...so you ARE sending me to hell.\"\n\n\"Of course not. She has no sense of taste. Besides, with enough training, perhaps we can improve some of the feasts up here in the next century or so. Farewell, mortal.\"\n\nAnd that's how the local dining scene truly became dominated by smorgasbord restaurants.\n",

            "comment": "It's uncanny how similar an internal interview is to final judgement. Down to the vague look of detachment and listlessness on - Carl flicked his gaze to one side of the table - yup, the person on the far left. Always the far left. The obvious things were off - instead of cheap suits, most of the god's - valkyries? It's been a while - had on a complex arrangement of armor and furs - but on the whole, Carl really couldn't tell the difference between this and his last promotion interview. Twiddling his spatula lightly in his left hand, Carl mused that this promotion might be a bit more permanent than that last one. One could tell how hard he was fighting to keep his face impassive by the subtle way his lip twitched. He couldn't help but find the humor in the fact that perhaps that company had done him a favor by firing him.\n\n\"I'm of the opinion that it is the wielder that makes the weapon\" said the red head to Odin's right. She had enormous wings folded behind her back and a long twisted horn on the belt of her gown. \n\n\"Of course you are, Sigrun. You brought him here!\" cried woman on the far left, suddenly filled with righteous indignation. She seemed to startle the rest of the council with her outburst, all of them turning to look at her.\n\n\"If you disagree, state your reasons\" said Sigrun. Her gaze fell back on Carl, making him feel immeasurably small. \"If you cannot do so perhaps it would be best to hold your tongue. In the meantime, if you ask me, he is plenty worthy of the title 'warrior'\"\n\nThere was a heavy silence as all of the gods and valkyries watched Carl. The uncomfortable dread that filled him whenever someone tried to size him up threatened to make him turn tail and flee the room. Why even bother with Valhalla anyway? Hel seemed perfectly fine...\n\n Yeah... But Carl didn't *want* fine. He wanted the Hall of the *Slain*. The hall of *warriors*. His childhood fascination with myths and legends filled him once again with the wonder and awe he thought he had forgotten. Carl fixed his jaw and met Odin's eyes head on. \n\nOdin's large brows furrowed as if he were deep in thought. He then slapped his hands on the table and sat back on his throne like he'd come to a decision. \"Charles DeAndre the Second!\" he said, \"What do you have to say on the matter?\"\n\nCarl, caught perfectly off guard, stammered \"Oh, uh... I was karate for six months so, I guess I could still do a jump kick?\"\n\n Odin and Sigrun glanced at each other, so Carl panicked and yelled \"and a ton of other cool stuff!\" \n\n\"Uh, I got to level 60 in Call of Duty Black Ops zombies. I know that probably doesn't sound impressive... but it... is.\" \n\nDead Silence.\n\nOdin never took his eyes off Carl, even as he asked \"What is he doing here, Sigrun. It is not like you to have miscalculated so grievously.\"\nSigrun actually pinched the bridge of her nose. Never had someone looked so exasperated with him since his mother found him on the roof with a homemade glider. \"I assure you, he is as much a warrior as anyone\" said Sigrun \"If you would just look at the circumstances of his death, it'd be perfectly clear why so.\"\n\n\"Ah yes, please Carl, *do* expand on that\" said the Valkyrie to the far left.\n\n\"Oh uh okay.\" Carl was suddenly aware that he was still wearing his work uniform. \"Well, I work at a restaurant - er, *worked* I guess. Anyway, we were being robbed - and usually, standard procedure is just go along with everything the robbers say and stay out of the way, but the robbers were just *off*, you feel me? As in, they were probably drug addicts or crazy. Probably both. Well, I was in the kitchen and I overheared two of the guys talking about how they were going to take one of the waitresses and... yeah. I couldn't live with myself if I let that happen, so I stopped them.\"\n\n\"You stopped them?\" asked Odin. \n\n\"Yes\" \n\n\"How did you do that?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" Carl was drawing a blank. \"That's a good question\" he said. Carl tried to play through his memories of the robbery but it was as if the whole thing was blurred out. Now that he thought about it...\n\n\"How *did* I die?\" \n\nSigrun opened her mouth as if to answer, but the Valkyrie to Odin's right beat her to it. \n\n\"Interestingly, it seems you were done in *after* you'd won the battle.\" she said, \"You were shot by one of you law enforcer's 'guns'\"\n\n*Oh*\n\n\"Oh\" Carl was temporarily lost for words. \n \n\"If it's alright with everyone, I think it's time we came to a decision\" said the last person in the room who hadn't spoken. She sat on the far right and kinda looked like Carl's best friend's Aunt Olga. There was a general hum of agreement.\n\n\"If you wouldn't mind stepping outside whilst we deliberate\" said 'Aunt Olga'.\n\nThere was a loud thunking sound behind Carl. He turned saw a large set of double door's that weren't there before standing open. \"Uh, sure. No prob\"\n\nCarl stepped into a large and beautiful hallway. While he admired the intricate crown molding, the council was deciding his fate. Another similarity of the internal interview and judgement day, though Carl wryly. Sooner than he hoped and somehow later than he would have liked, the council came to a decision and called him back in. \n\n\"We have chosen to administer a test\" said Sigrun before Carl could even sit. \n\n\"You will do battle here in front of us, and if we deem you worthy you will be accepted into Valhalla\"\n\nCarl felt the blood leave his face. \n\n\"Do you accept these terms?\" she asked.\n\nHe didn't know where it came from; perhaps the fear of leaving this room a coward, maybe a gut feeling that he'd *earned* warrior status and like hell was he going to give that up. Probably, Carl was just an idiot. Still, it's not like he could get any *deader*.\n\nBefore he could stop himself, Carl said \"Yes\"\n\n\"Good\" said Odin, before he leaped clear over the table and faced Carl. He drew his sword from it's scabbard and pointed it at him. \n\n\"Ready yourself\" \n\nCarl swallowed and lifted his spatula. With a roar like a raging bull Odin rushed at Carl. Carl, riding the high of ghost adrenaline or something ran at Odin as well. Just when his spatula met Odin's sword, a blinding light surrounded him and Carl found himself transported entirely from the room of judgement. \n\nAll around him were people in armor and carrying weapons. They were chatting with each other and drinking from large gold and silver goblets. Music filled the room.\n\n\"Hey! New guy!\" someone yelled. Carl was still processing what just happened, but turned in the direction the voice came from. A guy in fatigues with a rifle over his shoulder slung an arm around Carl. \n\n\"Seriously man, I cannot wait to hear your story\" he said looking pointedly at Carl's uniform and spatula, \"but first things first. Welcome to Valhalla!\"\n\n\n\n\n",

I was at work, a half hour to getting done with my shift, when the executive chef walked up and handed me a beer. He was met with a very unappreciative glare from me. \"What,\" he inquired. \n\n\"I know what your about to say, and I'm not doing it\" I reply. As I listen to his all to familiar explanation of how the worker to relieve me called in sick and I was needed for \"just a few more hours,\" I serve up the small kids cheese burger to join the two orders of Carbonara. I admire each dish, assuring it's perfection, and allow the waiting server to take the order. I look back at the chef and gulp down the pint he provided, and reply in a defeated tone \"fine but I'm taking a quick ten.\" As he nods and walks away I tuck a stray hair back into my bandana also feeling that my after-work joint hasn't been misplaced. I step outside behind the kitchen and with frustrated vigor I attack the joint. My lungs devoring it's essence. Flicking the small burnt carcass that was the roach away I run my fingers through my shoulder length hair and scragley beard, and with a sigh re enter the kitchen washing my hands.\n\nUpon returning to the line I notice a server headed my way, the one I just gave food to. \"This is no cheese,\" she says slidding the burger toward me. I pull the ticket off of the metal spike used to indicate a finished order, and point to the clearly printed \"cheese burger.\" She takes it and mumbles a quick \"sorry still need it\" as I drop the party on the grill I notice the chef hanging his phone up and the server, yet again, returning.\n\nThey both approach. \n\"He got a doctor's note for tomorrow, \nI need u, I know it's your day off... But hours right?\" Says the chef smugly, Knowing he will take shifts away if I refuse.\n\n\"He wants tenders now\" the server says. \n\nThe last thing I remember was a loud shout followed by a sharp dive toward them and a fury of swings with my spatula, accompanied by the screams of my victems. The rampage was brought to close when a coworker hit me in the back of the head with my frying pan. \n\nNow here I stood. Before Odin and company. \"My council has deliberated long. Never has someone wielding a spatula entered Valhalla. Cooks are not Warriors. You however, as your last moments show, live such a life worthy. You brought your wrath down upon a foe. May you and your spatula bring glory to the Halls of Valhalla.\" At this Thor places a hand on my shoulder ushering me through a door behind me. A parade of Asgardian heros cheered as they followed. He ushered me past many tables of Devine food and drink. Past angel maidens in the nude serving everyone everything. \n\n\"Is that what I think it is\" commenting on the golden trays of green herbs. \n\"A never ending supply of your favorite herb\" he bellowed with a chuckle. The accompanied pay on the shoulder jerked me foward a tad, and through a door at the end of the Great Hall. \n\n\"What the hell is this,\" I say in horror. \n\"Warriors fight eternal in Valhalla, have fun. He left me with a chuckle, holding my spatula, in the kitchen. I am now the only cook in Valhalla. \"You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.\"\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "I never asked for this. Honestly, I was just in it for the chicks.\n\nMaybe if I'd been born in a different time, I would've been a different man. There's certainly... *something* in my blood that coils and lashes when the stakes are high. But there's not much occasion for that these days. There's some sort of seal on the local evil that weakens every hundred years or so and I was born right in the middle of two comings. I guess I'm a part of the family of local legends, but that's not really relevant right now. Pretty sure I'm dead.\n\n\"Looking at these accomplishments,\" boomed the powerful voice of the table's obvious head, \"or lack thereof, I hope you have a good reason for bringing him before us, Loki.\" The wizened figure's eyes wrinkled with dubious curiosity.\n\n\"Perhaps 'One-Eyed' refers to your mind as well?\" A lithe, no, tenuously-formed figure chided. When speaking, this Loki snapped like a serpent. In his silence, he somehow took the appearance of a cautious wolf. \"Not that I mean to offend, All Father,\" his features softened and shifted to godlike perfection and serenity, \"But a man, a *hero* must be judged by the heroism of his actions given the lot he is drawn, should he not?\"\n\nA gleaming hammer split the table like thunder a log. \"You're mad, Loki! Where shows he the mettle of a true warrior of Valhalla in this? What say you is his weapon? This?\" Shards of the table's destruction still drifted down, setting a ridiculous scene. This third, golden-maned beast of a man held my spatula with clear disdain as the other two pushed back slightly from the splintered remains.\n\nYeah, a spatula. I mentioned I didn't have much reason to be a hero or warrior, didn't I? My life's mission consisted of flipping pancakes and \"carrying on the family legacy\", which I generally interpret as getting laid. Come to think of it, though, the last thing I remember is an explosive pop and the squeal shearing metal. Nothing exciting, I'm afraid. I was in the kitchen, after all, frying an order and daydreaming about Sonia before everything went black. \n\nBut Valhalla? Loki? Why am I... Is this really...\n\n\"Do continue, Loki. Neither Thor nor I have time for a farce.\" \n\n\"As you wish. And, Thor, do clean up your mess,\" Loki chided. \"This man before you, Juese, fights for his bloodline.\"\n\nMy jaw slacked. Loki regaled the other two with stories of my family that even I didn't know. He explained the hundred-year lapses. The need to carry on the name, to pass our supernatural power to face Dracula and his legions to the next generation. The dust settled with the mood and the air stilled.\n\n\"I am beginning to see your case for this one, blood-brother. A man such as he fights a tragic battle against circumstance, but still he fights.\" The blonde figure, Thor, said as he rolled a sliver of the table between his fingers. \"He continues his clan's war.\"\n\nA womanizer for justice. A warrior who cast down his whip to equip a spatula to keep his name alive. Such is the light in which I was cast. It didn't really sound that heroic to me, but Thor seemed to eat up Loki's honeyed platter of words. The features of the elder, who I had by now surmised was Odin, had relaxed as well. Perhaps a hint of excitement curled his lip... or am I projecting? My head swam in the possibilities.\n\n\"Very well, Loki. You have made your case, no, this warrior's case clear. And he truly did fall on his own sort of battlefield. A stove door is an uncommon projectile, but it struck true as any arrow.\" Odin stood, pointing the majestic spear at his side towards me. \"I sense a strong energy within him and believe that he will prove useful come Ragnarok. A hero of steaks and stakes! He shall crack pepper and whips! My chef and child in the final battle.\"\n\nA smirk flashed on Loki's now-vulpine countenance.\n\n\"Without further delay, welcome to Valhalla, Juese Belmont.\"\n\nMy smile shone back as bright as my spatula. \"Glad to be here, Loki. Now about those Valkyries I've heard so much about?\"\n\n---\n* edited for continuity\n\n* As an added note, this prompt immediately brought the [Juese Belmont OC Remix](http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR02319) to mind, which served as additional inspiration for this piece.",

            "comment": "The ceiling light faded away, leaving the sun gleaming in its place. I had time to remember a joke about Sherlock Holmes and a tent before sound leaked back into my little world, carried by a single word.  \n\"Rise.\"  \nI sat up, the spatula in my hand clanging against the ground. Surprise registered at the noise, but dulled, as though I should have expected it. The voice belonged to an old man, flanked by a pair of ravens. Each bird was the size of a horse, but somehow, the man himself seemed no taller than I, even with them on his shoulders. Pushing myself to standing without dropping the spatula was harder than it would have been otherwise, but my hand refused to open around it.  \nA glint of sunlight reflected into the old man's single eye as I stood, drawing his gaze. \"That is your weapon? I have seen many weapons of war in my time, but that, whatever it is, cannot be one.\"  \nI glanced down at it. The red along the serrated side seemed entirely too bright, but I couldn't remember why. One of the ravens hopped down from his shoulder. The first beat of its wings blew my hair back, drawing my eyes back up. By the time it reached me, though, it was no larger than an ordinary bird. It pecked disdainfully at the spatula for a moment, and turned to its master, croaking. \"No. A tool for cooking meat.\" It shook its head at me and took off, flapping back to its perch. \"He is unworthy.\"  \nThe old man glanced to the other raven, who croaked out his own reply. \"Wait. Let him defend himself.\"  \nI stared at it. The red still seemed as out of place as I was, before this man and his talking birds. There was something wrong there. Not just the color, but the tool itself. I fought to remember - had I been grilling? It was certainly warm enough here to stand outside, a beautiful summer day with the smell of meat grilling, music playing, the kids laughing and running, a knock at the door-  \n\"He has no defense. Look at that vapid stare. Send him on his way.\" The old man nodded, a condemnation that stung, and turned to the other raven.  \n\"Wait. Let him defend himself.\"  \nIt was the knock. Yes, that was it. We were all out there, in the backyard. The knocking was insistent, loud enough that we heard it over the kids. We hadn't invited anyone over, had we? She went to check, while I flipped the burgers, pressing on each one to test it, seeing the red juice trickle-  \n\"He was *cooking meat!* Look at his wrist, he's still doing it! He doesn't belong here, Odin. He is no warrior.\"  \nOdin - *Odin?* - turned to the other raven, who simply repeated his admonition. \"Wait. Let him defend himself.\" This time, his gaze caught mine. There was something fierce in that eye, something dangerous, and I found myself lost, trapped in that terrible gaze-  \nMovement at the corner of my eye broke my reverie. Another man had arrived to stand before Odin and the ravens. He was on his back, as I had been, but he writhed and twisted, as though grappling with an unseen enemy. He clung uselessly to a gun, twisted up against his stomach. His eyes, all I could see of his face behind the wool mask, stared up at me in horror, and I remembered.  \nRemembered her screaming, the door smashing in, the gun going off. Yelling at the children to run. Throwing open the back door, careening across the house to find her on the floor, him standing over her, gun pointed down. Diving over her, flailing at his face, the gun. Scoring a hit, feeling the serrated teeth bite into him. Feeling the gun go off, heat and pain piercing through me as we fell. Hacking at him as the gun boomed again and again, muffled by my weight. Seeing the red spatter and fly from the edge, sparkling in the sunlight-  \nA raven, croaking in unmistakable laughter, distracted me from the spray long enough to look up. Odin sat forward in his chair, his one eye wide in surprise. The hateful bird sat on the ground where it had fallen when Odin moved, its beak open in similar shock. The other bird, still atop its perch, laughed and laughed before speaking. \"You see? He has defended himself, and his home. Admit him to Valhalla, before that hapless invader dies a third time.\"  \nI looked down, to where I still knelt on the robber's chest. Blood pooled around him where the spatula's edges had torn open his neck, just as it had on the tile in my entryway. I watched as the light faded from his eyes again, leaving only the reflection of my wife's face, tears streaming, the ceiling light behind her head gleaming like the sun.  \n  \n\"Rise, berserker. Valhalla awaits.\"",

            "comment": "\u201cSo, tell us again?\u201d Said one of the people floating in the sky above me. \u201cHow you died again?\u201d \n\nI was sitting on a nice wooden chair, and above me were 5 people dressed in very nice robes. Three boys, two girls. They all looked very elegant and stylish, but one of the men had a large jagged tooth. I cleared my throat, and began speaking. \n\n\u201cOk. I was at my house making a nice grilled cheese sandwich, when all of a sudden a man in a ski mask broke in! He ran at me with a knife, but I got him with my spatula. But then he got me to the ground, put the knife to my neck, and I was deader than Christian Slater\u2019s career!\u201d \n\nThey waited for more, but I had finished. I sat down, and they began arguing. \n\n\u201cWhy are we even doing this? A spatula isn\u2019t a weapon, so he can\u2019t get in!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow now Darien. It can hurt a person a lot, so I think it is a weapon.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow hold on a minute!\u201d \n\nThe arguing grew louder, and I was getting bored. It took them five minutes before they agreed. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry sir. But you can only be let in if you died with a weapon in your hand. Spatulas are considered not to be a weapon, so we can\u2019t let you in.\u201d\n\nThis seemed bad. I do love a good argument, so I decided to start one.\n\n\u201cNow hold on a minute. Weapon in hand? That seems a little stupid. What about people who don\u2019t have hands? I\u2019ve seen people fight off things with weapons in their mouths. Is that an exception?\u201d\n\nThe man seemed to be getting nervous. \u201cW-Well I mean uh...\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some people use weapons in their feet! What about them?\u201d\n\nHe looked to the others for support, but they had no comments. \n\n\u201cAnd finally, weapon. A weapon is defined as something that can hurt or kill someone. Mostly kill. If you hit someone with a spatula a lot, they\u2019ll die, so I think it is a weapon!\u201d\n\n\u201cUh....I guess that\u2019s a good point, but-\u201c\n\n\u201cAnd fists can also be considered weapons! Have you SEEN boxing?\u201d\n\nHe was completely speechless. \n\n\u201cAnd if ya THINK about it, my mouth can be considered a weapon! For example:\u201d\n\nI pointed to the man with the long tooth. \u201cYou look like the product of a one-night stand between an orc and a random girl!\u201d\n\nThe man took great offense, I could tell. This sparked new discussion between them. The man cleared his throat, and talked. \u201cYou bring up a great point. We shall-reluctantly-grant you entrance to Valhalla!\u201d \n\nI clapped. \u201cAwesome! Quick question: what\u2019s Valhalla?\u201d \n\nAll five of them face palmed at the same time. \n\n____________\n\nFeedback is appreciated! (It\u2019s a little short compared to my previous ones.)",

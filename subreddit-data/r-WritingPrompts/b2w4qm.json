The wind was humid and heavy, and it carried an odd sort of heat.\n\nHe found himself on the greatest tree laying on the thickest bough, and from there he eyed the seam of land and sky, and there he found nothing but a gray day and vast solitude. \n\nHe was alone in a place he didn't know, clad in wet heaviness, and full of long and strange hairs. His thoughts spun and eddied, perhaps in an attempt to slink into the deepest burrows of his mind and disinter an immemorial memory, for this place, in odd ways, was familiar to him. \n\nBut for all that he tried, nothing did he find.\n\nAnd so, seeking for an answer, through careful movements he clambered down the tree, but even with his care his motions were unfamiliar, almost alien to him, and so a branch cracked and a new fissure ran across the already cracked surface.\n\nHe rose to his feet grumbling, and even the way he grumbled seemed alien. It was then when he looked at his hands, at the size of and color of them, at the amount of hairs and their thickness. There, with the wind muted and the shapeless veil of silence crowding the land, he remembered.\n\nThere was no desperation within him, no thundering heart, nor anything of the sort. There was one thing only, and that thing was an idea, an objective. That idea was enormous, so much so that it gave no space for others ideas to be thought.\n\nHe roved forth in this body that'd ceased being his a long time ago. Nights and days he ambled, hiding from creatures he barely remembered, clinging on to his deepest instincts to survive, but his wandering journey came to an end during the first night with a full moon, for there in the moonlit land, rising from a crevasse was a mushroom, and it was no common mushroom, for even looking at it filled him with joy.\n\nWithout hesitation, he reached for it, climbed to the tallest branch in the tallest tree, and there he ate, and all of this he did with a smile.\n\nMany times he returned to the hardpan, many times he returned to the desolation, and many times he sought for a new mushroom.\n\nAfter all, they were the gate to his true life.\n\n----------------------------\n\nr/NoahElowyn  ",

With practice you'll be able to write a decent story quite fast even when you just let your thoughts run.\n\nOne thing I make sure to do before writing the response is to think of a sort of clever or unexpected ending/twist, once I have that in mind, I can write much faster because all I have to do is go from point A to point B.\n\nBut don't be fooled with how fast we write prompts, I think fury will agree we are slow writers when we tackle serious writing projects (it took me around 4-5 hours to write 2k words when I was writing my book) \n\nIf you want to work on your speed, you can do sprints--set a timer for say 15 minutes and during that time write as much as you can and as fast as you can. The idea of sprints is to forget about the perfectionism, and get into that 'zone' where the words gush out.\n\nI apologize if this wasn't very helpful, if there's one thing I'm really bad at is teaching stuff.\n     ",

The once dull rock flaking apart forming a shape point like that time my neighbor BJ showed me.\n\nShaking my head I ad to put them back in their box.  This wasn't going to work if I kept reminiscing about them.  They aren't imaginary, They're just out of reach.\n\nwhatever it was that dragged me here, this life, this existance, wasn't the only one I had.    I could remember them all, i could feel them all, smell them all.\n\ni could remember the first kiss, I could remember ordering upsized fries at mcdonalds.\n\nIt wasn't all a dream.  \n\nIt had taken moments to prove that my knowledge wasn't just fever dream.  counting the seconds as a rock fell into a pond from a cliff, starting a fire, eatin cooked meat.   It was all things my furry body had never done before, but my real self knew intimatly, and there were no surprises.\n\nGravity fell at the same rate.   Sticks and dry leaves burned with friction, and the smal herbivore mammal roasted over those burning sticks tassted good, but needed pepper.\n\nThe things I knew, the things I had experienced had happened, if not to me,then somewhere, and somewhen.\n\nPlacing myseflf in the universe was hard, at first, but after awhile the moons familiar shapes presented themselves.    The stars were a little off, but the face of the moon shone down on me with it's familiar smile.\n\nI was on earth, but thing's were different, wilder, more primitive.\n\nI don't know how many nights i woke up, in cold hard sweat having an existential crisis that my existance here would wipe all of them out.  that i would eat the wrong animal, or stomp on the wrong sapling.\n\nI wasn't a butterfly in time making small ripples, I was a boulder thrown into the deep end swamping nascent humanities boat.\n\nOr was I supposed to be there?  was I the spark that lit the fire?\n\nthe only decision i had was to truck on, to try and think of myself as the first, and not the last.  Hope, apparently was a new concept to both my daytime and nighttime self.\n\nbuilding a shelter drew from early cadet training, hunting for food, setting traps.  the animals i was finding weren't rabbits, but they sure fell for snares rigged from moss and vines. \n\nEvery time i upgraded my situation I was reminded of countless youtube videos my bored nighttime self had watched, survivalist stuff, historical stuff...  primitive technoology made me chuckle when i remembered it.\n\nlife was hard, but geting more secure, and some of the other, and i'm using the term loosly, people had taken notice.   I'd started growing a few crops.  Mostly berries that my daytime self had found delicious, but other vegetables and some fruit were starting in the field I had planeted.  I'd even taken to breeding some of the mammals, I wonder was i responsible for the shape of some modern animals, or was i preventing it?",

I think that I'm ageless.\n\nI know if they had the concept of a god that is what they would call me, but they don't.  which gives me a sense of relief beyond belief.  If i had to contend with prayers and sacrifices from these furry primates, I'm not sure i could go on.\n\nAs it is, they come to my small wooden cabin when the thunder rolls, and the wind blows.  They stay away from my crops, and animals as i tought their ancestors.   But they gredily eat the food I lay out for them, the furs and clothes i've fashioned for them they wear.\n\nFire, fire was a big hurdle for them.  They had hidden from it at first.   Hissing and clawing from the cover of the forest.   It had taken me generations to get them close enough to the fire to warm themselves.  But now that they had, they had taken to the year round warmth with gusto.\n\nWandering through my ersatz kingdom, I saw my many projects.  Some overgrown and abandoned, some still thriving with life.   Various plants growing wild that had been attempts at cultivation, with varying levels of success.   My little homestead was growing, slowly but steadily over the centuries.\n\nI'd tried teaching them language.  It just didn't work.  Their minds couldnt hold onto any of the sounds i created.  I imagine they just didnt' have a language center in their brains yet or something.  I should have paid more attention to that lesson in school.\n\nMy true life hasn't grown any distant to me.  I sit under these ancient and savage skies sometimes, and let the noise, and the memories flood into my mind.\n\nCars, music, voices.  Some times I just lay back close my eyes and it washes over me like a half remembered story.  Pausing to try and concentrate on parts to verify if they were correctly remebered. other times I'm working and it hits me like a train. a memory so vivid that i can feel the sand under my feet, smell the dirt in the air.\n\nI confess that I don't always push them aside.  I've been guilty of long periods of meloncholy.   This has led to what i'm sure are very very confusing cave paintings if anyone ever discovers them.\n\nAs each new season rolls over to a new year, as each member of my adopted little family grows old and dies in front of me I have a sparkle of hope.\n\nAm I going home?  but the long way round?",

I woke up disoriented and alone, but soon found the telltale smoke of a bonfire, and found the tribe's latest camp.\n\nI was welcomed with open arms, but it was obvious I had changed. One doesn't live an entire second life without undergoing some serious mental restructuring after all. Fortunately I was still able to communicate with them, and I told them all about the impossible future I had lived. Buildings hewn from stone, permanent settlements bustling with countless people - wooden boxes with wheels pulled along by horses. All of this technology that would not be created for probably centuries or perhaps even longer; how could one possibly know the current year without any frame of reference?\n\nI had one memory more vivid than all - a glorious machine that would help us defend against the rival tribes and even against the mammoths, previously deemed far too powerful a foe to ever engage with. It took weeks teaching my tribesmen to sew fibers together, to sharpen stones into tools to fell trees, and to gather and prepare the necessary materials, but finally I could step back and appreciate the majesty of what must be my species's most powerful invention across all time.\n\nLet's just say: if mammoths or enemy tribes look to get within three hundred meters of us, they should expect to be on the receiving end of a 90 kilogram projectile.

            "comment": "Wait a minute, what, where was I?  I was in a place called a \u2018gym,\u2019 and I was looking at a very attractive female in very tight and smooth...fur, was it?\n\nThat was how I woke up. I remembered everything from the dream I had after I ate the mushroom growing out of the dung left by an elephant. Our more powerful gorilla cousins usually grabbed them first, but I was lucky. I found one, and I saw and learned from what I saw. \n\nThe females went to find food, and I stayed behind, looking for a good stick. Some of us used sticks for digging after roots and the grubs and other crawling animals we used as food. I held two of my fingers apart, looking for a stick that branched in just that way. It took me most of the day, and when the females returned with the food, I noticed how coarse real females were compared to the females in my dream, and after the Strongest took what he wanted, the rest of the males began to eat. I ate last, being focused on my search for the right branch. \n\nWhen I found it, I looked to see if anyone was watching. Everyone else was either eating, mating, or making waste. Strongest was mating, so I hid my stick under my arm, and I moved to my tree, climbed into my favorite branches and examined my stick. \n\nIt was a grayish-brown, and it had a few knobby parts, but it seemed strong. I tried to rub it smooth, but the best I could do was pull off some of the bark. One of the females came to my tree and offered me more food, hoping to shelter in my tree. I allowed her to climb up, and we shared our warmth with each other. We didn\u2019t mate, but we did learn each other\u2019s scent. She was pleasantly warm and smelled of a particularly delicious fruit. \n\nThe next day, we woke and she went to gather food. A gentle touch suggested she would return to bring me some particularly tasty food, and I abandoned my tree to find a rock. \n\nThe best place to find good rocks was where the water flowed. Unfortunately, large predators, elephants, and our larger cousins tended to go there for water as well. Standing water was better, as falling in was less risky. So I went to where flowing water met standing water, holding my stick, and making sure nobody else from my group was nearby. Maybe I would be eaten or lost, but that was a risk everyone took. \n\nI tried to be as quiet as I could, but I was louder than I wanted to be. Still, I was far enough away that I didn\u2019t alert danger. After many tries, I found a rock to suit me, but it didn\u2019t stay between the branches. It was getting close to the time the females would bring food, so I moved quickly, ignoring stealth, and returned to our trees. \n\nAgain the female with the pleasant scent brought me food, and we shared warmth. Another female came behind her, and she also had food. I allowed her to join us, and the three of us ate our food, mated, and slept among the branches of my tree. \n\nOne, or even two, females in my tree were of little consequence to Strongest. He had five, and if he wanted one from another male, he would intimidate the other male into submission or attack the other male. My females weren\u2019t particularly large, so I doubted that he would bother with mine. Other males might, but I was large enough to make them reconsider the idea. The two females who shared my tree went to gather food, and I stayed in the tree, trying to understand why my rock and stick wouldn\u2019t stay together. \n\nThen I saw the spider tree. An unwary bird flew into the spider tree and was held fast to the branches. I understood then that I could use the spiders\u2019 traps to make my rock and stick stay together. \n\nThis was dangerous because the spiders could make us sick with a bite, and some of us would die from the bites. So I found a long stick to pull some trapping strings away from the trees. I got a large wad of the strings, and ran away with it, making sure the spiders didn\u2019t follow me. \n\nI put the wad on the rock, and the rock fell out. I put the wad between the rock and the stick, and the rock fell out. I became frustrated, and stopped. Then I saw a snake capture a prey animal. It wrapped around the prey, holding it in place. Then, it devoured the prey. \n\nI put the rock between my hands and rolled the wad of trapstring between them, making them into a snake. Then I wrapped the string around the stick and the rock, and that kept them together!\n\nWhen the females returned, I decided I was going to get more food tomorrow than the females could bring. \n\nAfter the females left the next day, I went in another direction and waited in a tree. A large rodent came up to the tree, and I dropped down, swinging my new hammer into the rodent\u2019s head as hard as I could. Then, I returned to my tree, so the females who were coming to the tree could have some food as well. Strongest approached my tree shortly after the two females came back to my tree. He attempted to take the food I gave the females, but I swatted his hand aside, keeping my hand on my hammer. He grunted and shrieked at me, and I pushed him with my free hand. He then howled and beat his chest, and I grunted at him. Finally he seized the meat one of my mates was holding, and I swung my hammer at his head. Now I am Strongest. \n\nYou may think I don\u2019t remember all the things. The computers, cell phones, and cars. I do. I remember the books, music, and art too. I remember spices and where they can be found, but my species barely has language, and you have to start somewhere. ",

It drank the knowledge, swelling, evolving millions of years in mere moments as he slept. By the time his eyes opened, it was like his head felt heavier, and his heart drooped with the pain of a hundred false losses. The world he'd been born into suddenly felt foreign to re-forged eyes.\n\nThe One rose, a mental giant amongst skittering animals once seen as peers. He saw light bouncing off the Earth as vectors studied in physics class, and noted a slight curvature to a horizon that always looked flat. The stars no longer looked like specks of mineral in the distance, but giants, ancient relatives that began it all.\n\nHe wanted to speak, but a numb, dull tongue felt like lead in his mouth. That would require some work. Yes, work; there was so much to do, wasn't there? Problems to solve, knowledge to share, technology to build... why, the implications were immense. The world's order could totally rearrange because of him. A genetic catalyst that bombs the timeline.\n\nGrassland underfoot tickled as he strode determined toward his pack. It would take organization, and a lot of effort, but The One knew he could do it. He could change it all. With a purpose, and visions of worlds untold, he stood up straight and tall just like the smooth-skins of his premonitions. \n\nUnfortunately, the waning Oligocene Era was not one for casual strolls in a meadow. A slinking nimravid, effectively a bobcat with daggers for teeth, shifted low in the underbrush, eyeing her meal as it oddly limped on two legs instead of four-- injured, most likely, a prime target-- toward the treeline.\n\n-----------\n\n*Alternate ending for fun*\n\nMore than any of that, he knew his purpose was to rally and lead. Stoke a fire and gather the wild creatures, dumb though they may be, to a greater purpose. \n\nIt would take time, and a lot of effort, but The One knew he could do it. He could change it all. With a purpose, and goal in sight, he stood up straight just like the wrinkle-skins of his premonitions. He would rally the wild men and form a tribe, then an empire from there. An unstoppable force. \n\n*This is gonna be yuge,* The One, the smartest being alive, thought to himself. \n\n----\n\n*/r/resonatingfury*",

One, the Miocene started about 23 million years ago, so this would be latest oligocene. Secondly, Thylacosmilus was a South American Metatherian (near marsupial), so the analogy to a Sabre toothed bobcat, while superficially correct, isn\u2019t quite accurate. Going off of that, South America was still an island continent then, so Thylacosmilus is rather out of place in Africa. \n\nOther than those nitpicks, though, this was a great story.",

No one's arguing that.\n\nAs someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"crow family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people \"call the black ones crows?\" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.\n\nIt's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?",

Gone were the sleek and smooth tools that had made me everything I was. \n\nThe veil of sleep rested heavy on my eyes as I looked from my perch onto the Savannah and everything coalesced in my mind. There were the sunburnt thickets of thirsty grass rising from the ruddy soil, but where were the streets and towns? A gaggle of impalas grazed to my left, but where were the other humans? My friends? My family?\n\nI latched my foot onto the branch and swung to the ground. Here, the smells of urine and passersby and the cool dirt below my bare feet brought me back to my reality.\n\nBut how? The dream of that other life was so vivid. I had kids, a wife, a smooth and hairless body. I had a house made of steel and wires and concrete. I had books and a dog. I had a fridge where food rested until I was hungry. My stomach growled at the thought, and before I knew it, I was vomiting. In my mess was the remnants of the mushrooms I remember finding up over the hill. Panaeolus africanus - a species I had memorized in Med School. \n\nAware of their psychoactive qualities, it all made sense, but how could I have lived a life in another world?\n\nI took a deep, remembering breath as the rest of my troop began to filter towards me through the grasses. They grunted and babbled their familiar calls, which now seemed so simple. Lubo the Younger was the last to join me beneath the tree, hobbling across the clay and dragging one leg behind. The troop was in an uproar over his fall from the tree and all knew he'd be unable to keep up with us. Lubo would soon be dead.  \n\nI trundled up beside him and without really knowing why or how, I began to inspect the wound. The leg hung limp to his left, furry but taught with muscle. I could see the pain in his eyes, the fear. I gave him the most reassuring look I could muster and my mysterious training set in. \n\nI pulled grasses from the ground and broke straight sticks from the Acacia. I approached submissively and for whatever reason, despite the pain, he let me work. I lashed the grasses around his leg and the sticks to create a sturdy splint and then created a rudimentary crutch. I showed him how to use it and the rest of the troop thought I was playing. Soon, they were all trying to tie sticks together and jump around, but none could quite get the hang of it. \n\nEventually, Lubo was able to move without putting any pressure on his leg. If he kept this up and I watched him closely, Lubo would recover. I felt the familiar feeling of accomplishment, like the day I got my white coat, but it all now seemed so distant, so pointless.\n\nThat night, as we slept beneath the Savannah's blanket of stars, I crept from the tree and plodded up the hill to search for more magical mushrooms in hopes they would bring me back to my family, my friends, and that wonderful world I knew so briefly.

This was something I learned how to learn, learned, and then re-learned in the span of 20 minutes. \n\nI was having a somewhat difficult time deciding if I had just experienced something real, something worth remembering, though at the same time, if I had not experienced it, I wouldn't even be thinking of if I should remember it. Before that strangely real and incredibly vivid dream, I wouldn't even be able to have this existential crisis in the first place, because I wasn't able to think of anything to be existential about, I was a monkey. \n\nWell... perhaps not a monkey, in actual fact I appear to be an alien simian being relating more to chimps, though with clear differences. To assume alien is strange, though, given that I have been this ape for my whole life, and yet after the dream, I only now know that there is such a thing as an alien ape like I am. So am I the ape, or am I the human being that i have learned everything I am from? \n\nGiven it is the body I am currently inhabiting, I will concede to myself that I am the ape. Although, to assume that I am inhabiting the ape would mean that I am not actually the ape, but I digress. It seems there are more important things to do in order to continue this life. Firstly, food. \n\nA memory of tiny, zebra-like animals seems to get my large, sharper, canine teeth salivating, and so I set out to find a herd. They are usually found of the thick undergrowth of the lush jungles I've been sleeping in, and sure enough I find a pack of them below me, grazing on the blue grass that curls up like silly string and floats freely in the air. It isn't too hard to catch one, I'd done it a hundred times, and after a hundred times you know how to do anything by heart. Or so I assume, from my dream. \n\nNow, also assuming from my dream, I am now a pacifist, and an animal lover. I have a sudden need to battle myself on the ethical dilemma of if it is right to hurt, even kill another animal to sustain myself. After taking a look around to find and remember that the only edible fruit available to me literally tastes like the feces of my dream-selfs world, I quickly - if squeamishly - strike the tiny striped gazelle over the head with a rock. Pushing down my feces-tasting fruit lunch as I have to hit it again, and holding back the interestingly pungent tears that have begun welling in my eyes, one final blow to the beings head renders it dead, and the brains begin to pour out of the head. They are a very bright purple, and covered in a darker purple goop that, if one were to say the word \"ooze,\" they would immediately think of exactly what I was seeing, except purple, if ones personal description of ooze was not purple. \n\nNext was something I was proud of, I had learned it as a child, during a camping trip as a Boy Scout. Yet also as a child, I learned how to skin these animals with my bare hands and slowly slurp it down like noodles, before drinking the brains out and using the skull to- I would go on, but even if I did it myself, the feces-fruit is coming back up due to a new set of moral guidelines that I hadn't had 20 minutes ago. \n\nDuring the week I was out at camp those many, many years ago, (and by many years, I of course mean about 20 minutes ago, during the nap I had in a tree,) I learned how to make a fire. This was an invaluable tool out in the wilderness, and my newly formed sense of pride would allow me great satisfaction in showing the other monkeys this incredible spectacle. \n\nIt wasn't difficult to find what I needed, a good stick, a hard rock, and some easily burnable items. Next to my catch I sat down and within a circle of stones filled with tinder, I began the laborious process of using friction to heat up and ignite the tinder. Only, even with my simeon strength and endurance, the tinder did not ignite, or even smoke. It was impossible to get the damn thing to work, and I didn't have to learn how to be frustrated. I slammed the stick down on the rock and huffed loudly, this was not working and I would have to find another way to spark a flame. Images of a lighter or matches teased me, they were just as tangible as the powerful knowledge I had accumulated, and yet infinitely more useless.\n\nNot so useless was the simeon language now being hollered at me by my family. They seem to be in distress about something, but my simeon is a bit rusty, I haven't spoken it in a century. With the added need of having to stop and think about that, I was unable to translate the screeching before my untimely demise. My reign as the smartest being on the planet had a somewhat coincidentally hilarious ending. \n\nIf I had been able to translate the apes language, it was not anything helpful, as it did nothing to warn me of the actual threat: a massive cat-like beast with incredible fangs and a swishing, dual tail. Instead, if one were to translate what the monkeys had said (into something that any human being reading this would understand,) they would find the apes had said simply; \"watch out, stupid.\"",

            "comment": "\"I see.\"\n\nThe words - if you could call them that - came out between a cough and sputter, a mixture of a hoarse screech and pained wheezing. Stirring awake with a strange lump in my throat, and the streams of tears flowing down my cheeks, I did what anyone would've done. I sat down, and cried. I mourned for the imaginary me's death, of another life that I dreamed, of the friends and families that I've made. The sensation of wiping the tears from my eyes with such unusually large, almost clumsy hands is strange. It's been decades since I've used them, after all - or so I perceive.\n\nFrantically remembering what I've done right before I became me in another realm, I searched frantically for another one of those mushroom. Alas, it was the last of its kind, and I don't have the knowledge of mycology to possibly replicate more of it. Google or Wikipedia would've helped, but such fantastic creations, of having access nearly the entire knowledge of mankind at my fingertips, shall forever remain a ghost of a memory, buried within me.\n\nHowling, pounding, cursing, screeching in anger against the unknown force that be that played such a cruel joke upon me, an average being with no notable features, the words form. Crudely, I utter a stream of expletives at my newfound curse of intelligence, and of a life that I've lost, filled with regret. The show of sorrow and anger took hours, and seems to have scared away many other beasts. A particularly large feline seemed to be hungry, but one death glare and a roar later it darted back into the tall grass, even. The other primates that were attracted by the noise were confused and worried, but it's not something that they can truly understand.\n\nSlowly, the sorrow and anger died, and came a smile. One of bliss and happiness, of fond memories and a life well spent. Taking the time to recover, pushing side the others to get some water, I slowly recounted my life. There were sad moments, and there were happy moments, but in a way, I've been \"isekai (\\*1)\"'d like one of those Another World novel. I could use my knowledge as a human, and possibly the smartest of all beings, to build society out of those primates, or even make my own legacy here.\n\n(\\*1: Isekai is Japanese for \"Another World\", a trend of novel in Japan and China where the main protagonist is transferred to another world, one way or another, and various adventures or misadventures occur.)\n\n... But that would be boring, wouldn't it? What good is it to be memorialized forever, if life is merely a hallucination caused by a mushroom trip? In the first place, was I the butterfly or the dreamer? No, if those dreams were real, a prophecy of future to come, then there's only one thing to do.\n\nTurning back to the other primates, I began to speak and screech, conversing in broken Primate. \"My brothers and sisters. I had a vision. A vision where there is lots of water, where fruits grow where we want, where dangers are kept away by the strength of many ones instead of strength of ones of ones. Where we don't worry about going to the smaller hole when a big cat come, because we have came together as many instead of ones.\" The other primates were suitably confused, but that's fine. For now, they just have to start moving. Once they've started moving, they'll learn to think.\n\n\"I brought from the long dreams a spark of light, from a giant being named Prometheus. It is the wildfire that turned sky red and the grass black.\" The primates panicked, even as I hummed in a soothing voice, \"He brings us a gift, and wish us happiness. He is friend, look.\"\n\nStarting a small campfire (Scouts training really helped) and keeping it contained, the other primates were in fear and awe of a controlled fire that I've made. Sitting the others around the campfire, I started telling them stories and legends from what I can remember, making up the rest where I can't. It earned laughter and tears, or the occasional puzzled stares as I came upon concepts too alien for them to understand, but that's fine. I spoke to them in length of the theft of fire and demonstrated the fire, and of various mythos - Greek, Norse, even Lovecraftian, to capture their attention and get them used to my voice, as my language slowly shifted more and more from primate to a simple form of English. As the collective fancies of the mankind as I remembered them captured the primates, I taught them what I considered the most important lesson of all, between that of powerful beings and heroes.\n\n\"... And the heroes compromised, that they would not take and steal from one another.\"\n\n\"But, they strong. Why strong not take?\"\n\n\"Because heroes are strong, but big heroes stronger. But big heroes also need to sleep, and sleeping heroes are weak. The heroes agree that they will not hurt each other.\"\n\n\"Like tribe?\"\n\n\"Like tribe, yes. They promise not to take each other's things, take other's partners, take other's shelters, giving up those... Freedom.\"\n\nI taught the primates what I considered the important aspect of society, law. By illustrating how the heroes in my story gave up the freedom to harm one another, they were able to work together. By making examples of how the primate tribes have certain commonly agreed upon habits, I explained to them the concept of following traditions. By insinuating and manipulating their train of thought, I connived the primates into wondering and dreaming about the benefits of working together in a lawful society, where one do not have to worry about others in the tribe taking advantage of their moments of weakness. From this spark of fire stolen from Prometheus, the OG thief of fire, I gave the others knowledge of cooperation, law, and society.\n\nI am not sure if this seed will take hold and sprout, but... The mankind of another me, this is my gift to you, the only gift I know how to give, being the idiot that I am. A seed of wonder and stories, a seed of order and cooperation, an early start on us hopefully being less of an asshole toward one another. If this butterfly dreamer's wings beat and caused enough of a storm in your future, that you could have less pain and suffering, that's all I, and the other I, could've ever asked for.",

The inside of my mouth feels terrible, and I don\u2019t want to think if it\u2019s ever been cleaned before. I move toward the light coming from one side of the dwelling, careful not to wake the others. Outside it appears to be night, but there is a lingering brightness from the moon and stars, and someone has lit a fire. A few.... cavemen? What the actual... yes, those are definitely cavemen! They are sitting around this fire, facing away as though they are keeping watch. They bare their teeth at me in greeting, but apparently notice something off about me because their welcome turns to concern. \n\nI take a step out of this strange sleeping place, letting the thick cloth swing closed behind me, and greet them with a similar smile.

The world around her was wild and unkempt. Looking around she slowly started to remember. She was an ape, like the ones she read about in... another time.

Memories of The Bible returned to her. She acknowledged them as the fruit of knowledge, and she was Eve. The humans were wrong. The Fruit of Knowledge was not a curse given by some God. They were, instead, the source of humanity. She stood straighter, knowing that she was the first true human., albeit a primitive one.\n\nAnother one of her kind approached.

Stage IV pancreatic cancer had meta.. metas.. \"Fuck, I've heard this said to me a 100 fucking times\" I thought to myself. Maybe it's finally spread into my brain, fucking yay. \n\nIt was hot this morning, I could feel the sweat sticking to me but it felt different, like I wasn't wearing my hospital issued robe. My eyes were finally adjusting and \nI moved my right arm to reach for the little button that gave me a shot of painkillers, which was always too little to help with the pain and pressing it more than once never gave me any more but I did it anyway just in case. \n\nBut it wasn't there and I wasn't in a hospital room but outside lying down under a massive oak tree. It was so hot, even under the shade. I had no idea what the time was. There was nothing in the horizon, not power lines, buildings, roads, nothing. \n\nBut I had this feeling gnawing at me, that I knew this place. That I had been here before. I tried to call out for the nurse, my son but nothing came out of my mouth except some garbled moans. \n\nI couldn't remember my son's name, what state I was in, what my wife's name was. I knew I had a wife who died a year before and we had a son but it was all slipping away like when you're waking up from a dream and trying to hold on to the details but no matter how you try you can't. \n\nI hear a noise next to me and I turn my head slowly. I see a woman, naked, a primitive looking face, black hair and a slim but muscular build. Looking at her, I thought to myself \" I know this face\". She was looking at me with hopeful relieved eyes. \n\nI look down at my body, I'm naked and I'm young again but with a lot of hair all over my chest, abdomen and arms. This is the first time I realize I feel no pain. I can't remember what disease I had but what was pretty evident that I had a raging boner. \n\nShe sat down next to me and I put my arms around her thinking I was in this exact place before overlooking the sun which was setting now in front of us. I also remembered what we did after we sat looking at the sunset, it was all coming back to me. My old life that ended with cancer a distant after thought. \n\nI took her hand her and made her lie down and I got on top of her, looked into here deep dark brown eyes and I was inside of her, just like I had done many a times before. \n\n",

But something had changed. \n\nHe stood up quickly, head swiveling round and round. Silence. I tried talking to him and he signaled for silence. After a few minutes he slowly sat back down and stared at me. And, somehow, through me.\n\n\"I have seen the land beyond this.\"\n\nThat was... what?\n\nHe gripped my shoulders and shook me. \"Come... there is much to do.\"\n\nThe next few days went fast. He challenged and won the contest of battle for head of our tribe. How, I don't know. No one had ever fought like he did. Like a snake and a lion combined. What we did next we barely understood. But soon our tribe had 'homes'. And food in abundance. A wall for protection. But this was only the beginning. Over the next summers things progressed rapidly. Our tribe grew. Our thoughts grew sharper. We had tools of hard earth and fire. They made us stronger, quicker, healthier. We moved, closer to the water. We learned of the food from the sea. And of boats. Many things.\n\nA city grew. Many homes. Many of us. All working as one. We learned to write, and to math, and to bring the imaginary to reality. \n\nHis thoughts, his ambitions, were always bigger than ours. He would speak of the next land, of how every tribe would have their own city like ours one day. We would gather people to ours. To grow strong as one.\n\nAtlantis. That is what he called our place. Only this time it would be real, with high unfloodable walls. An unending center of civilization for the world. That is what he said. I did not know what he meant. I could only see the next step and not the whole journey. \n\nNeither of us would live long enough to see that he was wrong.",

There are no numbers to count the days, months, years, as they flow by. No one seems to care, either. I am surrounded with primates who cannot think beyond what they know. They do not question our very existence as I do, nor do they wonder what could happen next.\n\nEat, sleep, survive. Reproduce. Die.\n\nThey know nothing of the future I saw.\n\nWas it real?\n\nI can feel the memories slip away as if it were just another figment of my imagination. But how could it be, with all its details and complexities? One mind cannot imagine such a society on its own, can it?\n\nI am losing part after part of the knowledge I had with every passing second, as my primate mind seems to take over, erasing the thoughts of this universe, slipping through my fingers like sand. I no longer remember what the excitement of learning something new feels like, nor do I recall the empowerment of being part of a crowd, of a community. They know nothing of adversity, of sadness, of happiness, of guilt, of greed.\n\nThey are missing as much good as bad.\n\nWas it all just a dream?",

Scientists said from scratch it would take 4,000 years of innovation to get to the mid 1400s even if population booms made it possible. The ice caps will take 45,000 to melt off. If we\u2019re lucky. I must be somewhere in North America I recall star constellation and I\u2019m somehow jn the Mid West. Glacial Ice is a mile high, daily deadly ice falls off the megalithic ice sculptures. Unreal 200 foot ice sculptures Adorned the local mountain peak. I guess they don\u2019t have much to do.      I saw am encampment about a quarter mile in the distance a few hundred were having some sort of dance off. Ok I may not know how to start a fire but I know how to do the floss and the macarena dance. It was an instant success I became the best dancer probably on Earth. The seinfeld dance , my secret weapon unleashed in only the fiercest dance battles. I traveled extensively for about 20-30 years amassing a large fan base and even a pet liger in the process. I had 20 wooly mammoths, I was living large much like the flinstones of my day. Dinosaurs existed, I even ran for Pangea President , we however stopped the election mid way so I could do more rain dances in the desert and stop raining dances in the places it rains too much. That fact and we discovered alcohol last week. I\u2019m liking this life a whole lot better than that bad dream.

            "comment": "It was an impossible feeling, having one's eyes close and open simultaneously. Yet that is what seemed to happen. I closed my eyes for the last time gazing at Samira. Her eyes caressed me with their sparkle and I did not feel afraid to go, knowing I was so loved. As that image faded and the curtains dropped, I found myself staring down at some sort of predator.\n\nMy heart raced. How I knew it was a predator I don't know because I had never seen an animal like this before. It moved sporadically, it's limbs sharp and angled. It snuffled and groaned around the base of the tree, occasionally jabbing at it and half-heartedly throwing its body against the trunk. Some instinct told me to be wary but also not to fear as this beast could not climb.\n\nI turned my eyes up from the earth and gazed at the tree canopy around me. Jungle or forest, I couldn't tell. There was much more yellow apparent in the foliage than I'd ever seen during any of the long months I'd spent on field expeditions.\n\n*\"Huffff!\"*\n\nMy vision snapped back below as the dark creature shuffled away out of site. Evidently it had given up on me.\n\nMe... me?\n\nMy sense of self had changed somehow, and it was very unsettling. My roving eyes flitted past my hand and then returned as fast as the shock shivering up from my toes.\n\nI was covered in hair! Not only my hand but my whole body. I touched my face and it felt soft beneath my fingertips. I was some sort of ape! Exactly what type Samira would know. 75 years together, 30 of them spent on field assignments and somehow, I had never managed to absorb any of Samira's knowledge. Though I can say quite frankly I had never really tried.\n\n\"This is a puzzle we'll only ever solve together\" she always used to say about our life. \"You keep track of your pieces and I'll keep track of mine.\"\n\nBut she wasn't here and I needed her now... This didn't make sense. I had felt death come over me. I'd accepted it. When I left Samira I did so knowing it was forever, and yet here I was. I was alive still and so Samira must be as well. I needed to find her.\n\n*Whump!*\n\nThe branch shook and I snarled and swung at the being that had just appeared next to me. The other ape swatted my arm away and glared. It began tugging and tracing its fingers through the fur on its chest in a way that I somehow understood.\n\n*Tug, swirl, tug tug, swirl.*\n\nThe ape's fingers drew patterns through its red chest hair, tugging intermittently for tone and emphasis.\n\n\"Rin I've been looking for you! There is trouble at the Vestule, an unknown one possessing grave injuries has arrived and is asking for you urgently. What is that in your hand!?\"\n\nI understood the ape's silent language completely and I raised my hand and opened my palm in compliance. The ape's slate grey eyes widened at the sight of what we both knew to be poisonous mushrooms. A memory of an acrid taste on my tongue surfaced, along with some other memories I did not recognize. The ape whom I now knew to be Janu slapped the mushrooms out of my palm.\n\n\"I don't understand your obsession with these spores which should not be eaten. Come we must hurry to the Vestule, the unknown one may not have much time.\" Janu ended her sentence with a slash across her chest followed by two swift tugs, then turned and leapt into the neighbouring tree.\n\nHer urgency overrode my utter confusion and I followed, trusting my body to fling itself boldly through the air. We hurtled through the tree tops at full speed and before long we reached a wall of rock. Janu's momentum switched from horizontal to vertical instantaneously and the canopy rustled as she shot up the rock face out of site. I followed, and as I broke through the top of the yellow canopy my fur began baking in the heat radiating down from a giant sun, high in the sky. Janu didn't slow, despite the heat, and I was panting hard as I tried to keep up with her.\n\nThe rock towered high above, and I ventured a guess that we were heading for the summit. The veins in my arms throbbed, my heart drummed and I felt exhilarated. I closed the gap between me and Janu and with one final effort flung myself over the peak onto a broad plateau.\n\nOff to the left a large group of the apes with grey eyes huddled beneath the shade cast by an immense tree. Janu pulled me forward and pushed through the crowd to the centre where an ape with fur like a sunset crouched over a figure on the ground. Janu traced a swirl and tugged twice on the sunset ape's back. She looked up at us, locked eyes with me and moved quickly to the side.\n\nI gasped and staggered forward. My vision blurred and the world shrunk until for me it held only Samira. The corners of her mouth turned upwards, though her jaw was set in pain. She reached up and caressed my cheek. Her human form looked so fragile against the alien soil. She was wearing a cloak I didn't recognize, most of which was soaked in blood. I took it to be originating from the spot on Samira's side where the sunset ape was pressing a piece of dark moss.\n\nSamira's hand moved from my face to her own chest and her eyes again caressed mine as she traced out a message.\n\n\"You can save me, I'll tell you how but then you must act quickly! Much more hangs in the balance here than just my life. A terror you can't imagine is set to engulf this world and if this one falls, so will all the rest...\"",

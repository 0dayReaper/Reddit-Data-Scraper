            "comment": "Valentine smiled at Devin and gave him a hug, not minding the sweaty clothes. He set his duffle bag down and picked her up in its place. The couple didn\u2019t notice the bag flickering away, replaced by a gun, whilst blood started to well up beneath Val\u2019s shirt. Devin sunk to his knees, clutching her to his chest.\n\n\u201cNo. It was supposed to be me.\u201d He breathed, trying to stem the flow of blood pouring from the gunshot. Neither knew who had administered it. Perhaps Devin himself had. After so long they knew not to question.\n\nA figure walked toward them, through the fire that sprang out of nowhere. The woman\u2019s face was twisted in anger as she stalked up to them, weapon flickering from sword to guns and back again. \n\nAgatha ran up to Devin and slapped him. \u201cYou bastard! Cheating on me with my sister!\u201d She screamed in their faces, tears treading down her face as fangs took the place of her canines and her face grew deathly pale. \u201cLet me have her! She\u2019s already dying!\u201d\n\nDaniel meekly stood, holding the woman out. \u201cPlease. Please, just leave our children alone. You can have her!\u201d \n\nHis wife gasped in protest, trying to move as the fever burned her up. It sapped her strength, weakening her even as Daniel gave her over for vampire food. The vampire placed her lips on the sickly woman\u2019s neck and slowly bit in, savoring the flavor of fresh blood. Her body curved around the woman\u2019s, wanting more. Julia pushed her away, face burning.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love you like that Avery. I don\u2019t and I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\n\nAvery followed her, arms outstretched.  She grinned and caressed Julia\u2019s face as her own rotted. \u201cCome on, Jules. I know you do.\u201d She was no longer beautiful in a moment but a maggot eaten corpse. Daniel entered the scene again, holy water held out in one hand as he stared at the body scratching at Jules.\n\nDaniel threw the vial on the reanimated corpse and it grew limp. Jules pushed it off. He clasped Daniel\u2019s hand. \u201cWell done my brother! A bit close for comfort, but well done.\u201d\n\nThe scene flickered to a space station and back again, causing the corpse to cock its head. In a southern accent it said, \u201cGuys? Help?\u201d\n\nJules\u2019s eyes grew in his head, perhaps to adapt to the alien environment. But when the environment changed back, the man did not. He clutched his head, falling to his knees as a swarm of bullets, streaking along the night sky with abandon. Nathan laughed and spun, tucking his wings and barreling toward the sea. The sun warmed the hair on his neck, alerting him to the watcher. She was watching, always watching. For if she did not learn quickly, she would be rejected. Her blue eyes glittered as she studied her books brought her to new places. Places that were safer. Places that were free, buy one get one! Hurry, hurry, hurry! He always hurried, to work, to school. To a life that was empty. \n\nEmpty. His water ration had finally run out on him. He knew she would, she loved him more than she loved him like life itself seemed to have no meaning. But everything was meaning. Everything meant someone shouldn\u2019t be alone, not in this time, ticking ticking tocking. Ticking ticki n g  t o c k  i   n",

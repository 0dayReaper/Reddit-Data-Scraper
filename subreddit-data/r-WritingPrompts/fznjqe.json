            "comment": "Mercury was going to die, again.\n\nThis time, he wore the body of a man. He was spread out long on a pike, his arms and legs bound to the pole. Two pairs of huge human men carried him--pale-faced and bearish in their thick winter coats--between them, the pole balanced between them.\n\nThey learned, quickly, that Mercury was the slippery kind. They never untied him after they caught him nearly sweet-talking his guard out to the water, where he would have stolen a canoe and paddled desperately away. \n\nBut he was caught now. Surely trapped now.\n\nHere on an icy planet on the ass-end of nowhere. They had no idea he was a god in his own right. That out there beyond the unblinking stars, he had his own kingdom. An entire spinning world--still alive in those days, before the darkness came. His world still carries his name: Mercury the trickster, Mercury who always spun too close to the sun.\n\nAnd this time, he got burned. \n\nThe god wrestled against the bounds, tying him to the pole. He cursed and struggled.\n\nOne of the pallbearers spat something at him, unrecognizable. A dribble of gibberish language. \n\n\"Yeah, alright,\" Mercury muttered. \"Because that makes sense.\"\n\nA crowd of hooded cult members walked with them. They all wore those strange human faces. They trudged through the ice-crusted snow, just as grey and cold and wind-swept as the barren mountain all around them. \n\n\"Really funny joke, guys,\" Mercury said. \"Really great. Are you going to let me go now or not?\"\n\nOne of the hooded figures walked alongside him. The hood was pulled too high for him to see the stranger's face. \n\nThe god growled and fought against his bonds. Ahead of him, the cult leader walked at the lead of the procession. He carried Mercury's staff, the source of his power. Its stone was the heart of a star, but it burned dead and lifeless in that mortal's hand.\n\nWithout it, Mercury was useless as a fire without oxygen.\n\n\"This is just fucking humiliating,\" the god muttered, but his guards only gave the stick an aggressive shake.\n\nThe rope bit even deeper into his aching arms.\n\nThe figure alongside him spoke at last in that unmistakable, ancient language: Mercury's mothertongue, the language of the stars. \n\n\"It's your own fault, you stupid asshole.\"\n\nMercury hesitated. It took him a long second to recognize his brother's voice. \n\n\"Oh,\" he managed. He did his best to do dignified, despite shuddering from his back and ass dragging miles through the snow. \"Funny seeing you here.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Funny.\"\n\n\"You don't happen to know why a bunch of your creations want me dead, do you?\"\n\nEarth gave Mercury a hot knifing glare. He was a young god like Mercury, his planet just as much a cosmic accident as Mercury's own. But he had a few million years on Mercury's kingdom, and Earth never let him forget it.\n\n\"Certainly you can't be that surprised. This is all your own making.\"\n\nAll around them, the humans were carrying on like they couldn't hear or see Earth at all.\n\nOf course. The damn bastard still had his own staff. All his powers.\n\nMercury did his best to look innocent. \"I've no idea what you're talking about.\"\n\n\"Really? You don't recall how all this started?\"\n\n\"I just came down here to give my beloved elder brother a visit--\" maybe steal a resource or two, start a tiny war, knock down some dominoes to see how long it took for Earth to notice; the usual \"--and these monsters of yours attacked me.\"\n\n\"Not this time. The other time. When you told them that the lord of their universe was a great ass-faced bastard and the next time they saw someone flying out of the sky, they'd better take his fancy glowy-stick and sacrifice him by tying him up and tossing him off the face of the tallest mountain, least the ass-faced god of the world kill them all. Remember that?\"\n\nMercury fought off his grin. He looked around at the peach-esque sigils on the hoods of all the cult members--notably, not his brother's. \"Oh. You heard about that one.\"\n\n\"I certainly did.\"\n\n\"I hoped they'd catch you, you know.\" Mercury flexed his numb fingers. \"Didn't quite predict this.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know.\" Earth gave him a plain smile. He wore a stranger's face, but Mercury had the double-sight of the gods. He could see Earth's true form underneath. The smugness of his smirk. \"And that's why I'm not going to stop them.\"\n\n\"Oh, you *prick*.\" Mercury wrestled hard against the bounds. He cringed as he imagined falling through the air forever, breaking apart. The death-system on Earth's planet reknitting his atoms and spitting him back out into his god-self once more. \"You have absolutely no sense of humor.\"\n\nHis brother just smirked and said, crisply, \"Whenever you regenerate, Father wants to see us both.\"\n\nMercury scowled as he imagined their creator Sol, lord of the sun, just cackling if he heard about all this. It was bad enough losing to a bunch of animals on his brother's kingdom, much less having to *admit* it.\n\n\"What does he want?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I was too busy savoring this moment.\" Earth grinned around at all the cult members trudging up the snowy mountain. They still didn't seem to realize he was even there.\n\n\"If you can make these idiots not see you, can't you make them let me *go?*\"\n\n\"I could. But I'm an ass-faced god, aren't I? And I do demand my sacrifice.\"\n\n\"You can't be serious about this!\" \n\n\"Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not.\" His big brother grinned as he leaned down to pat Mercury's shoulder, which trailed through the ever-deepening snow. \"Guess you'll find out soon.\" \n\nMercury fought and screamed all the way up the mountain.\n\n***\n/r/nickofstatic for more stories from me and my best friend NickofNight.

            "comment": "Blood gushed from Calais's neck, running down the stone altar in a crimson stream. It stung a little, as slit necks often do, but what bothered Calais was the leech stuck to the bottom of his foot.\n\nGood cultists *cleaned* their sacrifices. Calais had lived with humans long enough to know they were a nasty bunch, but not even they ate bug festered food. Calais would have shaken his head if he wasn't pretending to be dead.\n\nBowing in front of the altar, rows of masked cultists knelt prostrated, chanting in ancient Greek. Calais had to commend them for that. One of the tragedies of society, he thought, was the loss of cultural roots under the crooked guise of \"modernization\". Or the equally unscrupulous \"globalization\".\n\nCalais didn't mind a good human sacrifice. It was old fashioned. Made him feel at home. He didn't mind being the one on the altar either; one had to do their part for society after all. Besides, when you lived as long as he did, you were bound to be picked for the role once or twice.\n\n\"We beseech you, Bacchus,\" the cultist in the gaudiest robes said, \"drink this mortal wine and bless us with your presence!\"\n\nCalais sat up. Blood flowed down his chest like a vestment.\n\n\"Wait a minute. Bacchus?\"\n\nChanting turned to silence then to murmurs, as the room of shocked cultists stared at the bloody man on the altar. Through his goat horned mask, the head cultist glared at the one holding the knife. The knife cultist shrank into his robes.\n\n\"Wait, wait, wait,\" Calais continued, ignoring the growing whispers, \"is this...The Cult of the Horny Goats?\"\n\nThe head cultist yanked the knife from the hand of his subordinate.\n\n\"Yes,\" he sighed, storming up the altar's steps, \"now get back down.\"\n\nCalais held a hand up. \"Hold on, aren't you guys meant to, you know. Sacrifice goats? Like your namesake?\"\n\nSome of the cultists in the outer rows muttered amongst themselves, hoods nodding.\n\n\"I thought this was a sex thing,\" one whispered.\n\nThe head cultist silenced them with a glare from the slitted eyes of his mask.\n\n\"Nonsense. Bacchus is a vegetarian. He doesn't need goats.\"\n\n\"Yeah that's kinda the joke... Look I don't want to usurp your leadership or anything, but I'm telling you, Bacchus isn't really into this sort of thing. He's a bud, I'd know.\"\n\nThe head cultist pushed Calais down and stabbed him in the heart. He sprinkled in a few stabs to the gut for good measure. Trundling down the stairs with a huff, he resumed the prostrated chanting. After a few bewildered glances, the other cultists knelt to do the same.\n\nCalais sat up again, blood cascading like waterfalls from his new orifices. \"And mortal wine? What is this? The Hades Cult?\"\n\nThe cultists burst into chatter and the head cultist's ears burned like a turnip.\n\n\"Who brought this guy?!\" he thundered.\n\n\"Sorry, sorry.\" Calais said, \"Your house your rules. I'll die now. Blergh.\"\n\nHe collapsed onto the altar and stuck his tongue out, doing his best to suppress his grin. He couldn't wait to tell Bacchus.\n\nr/bobotheturtle",

            "comment": "I woke up sitting in a dim room, my thoughts hazy as I slowly regained consciousness. Where was I? One moment, I had just been minding my own business reading a book in the park, the next I had felt a stinging pain at the back of my head before everything faded to black. I tried to move my arms, only to find that they were restrained behind me. This wasn\u2019t good.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well, our guest has finally woken up,\u201d I heard a voice call out from the shadows.\n\nSuddenly, I snapped awake and looked around the room wildly. There were six people standing in a semicircle in front of me, their faces barely visible. All of them mostly naked, all covered in blood and intestines wrapped around themselves. Skulls and animal corpses decorated the walls and ceiling of the room. A man wearing some kind of black dome helmet, who I could only assume was the leader, was looming over me and was holding a sharp knife in his right hand. Oh fuck. I\u2019ll lived long enough to recognize a murder cult when I see one. Oddly enough though, I wasn\u2019t panicking as much as I should be. I\u2019ve gotten myself out of much worse situations than this after all.\n\n\u201cAny last words before we gut you?\u201d whispered the man in the helmet.\n\nWhy the hell are you doing this?\u201d I shouted back, trying to wiggle out of the ropes wrapped around my body. I\u2019m fully aware that I\u2019m not the nicest person, but I\u2019m pretty sure I haven\u2019t done anything that deserves being eviscerated.\n\n\u201cAhh..I\u2019m glad you asked,\u201d the man said, smiling a psychotic grin. \u201cI\u2019m Gregor, the great great great great great grandson of the First Priest of the forgotten Pastafarian Faith. To satiate the hunger of the Black Devil, we humbly offer up your intestines and --\u201d\n\nI stopped struggling. Pastafarians? Why did that name ring a bell? A sudden memory sprung up from my depths of my mind, one that I haven\u2019t thought about in centuries. No, it can\u2019t be that. Surely not, it would be too absurd. But I can\u2019t stop myself from asking anyway.\n\n\u201c...Are you talking about the Pastafarian Church by the priest Linguine from the village of Vox?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an audible gasp from the other cult members. \u201cHow could you possibly  know about the Founder?!\u201d hissed one woman.\n\nI stare back at them dumbfounded. \u201cWhat the fuck? Is that what all of this insanity is about? Because of a prank that I pulled 400 years ago?\u201d\n\nThe man in the helmet grabs me by the front of my jacket. I can see fury in his eyes. \u201cWhat the hell are you babbling about, heretic?\u201d\n\nI stare back at him with disdain. \u201cYou are completely delusional, you idiot.Back when I was still mortal, I did a prank for the \u201cBlack Devil\u201d that you\u2019re referring to. I showed up  covered in spaghetti when a wolf pack arrived in the village and drove them out with a whip I made out of pasta. Then, I held an assembly,  told the chief that his new name was Linguine and put a \u201choly\u201d colander on his head. After that, I left behind a stone tablet declaring to all the villages that they needed to offer sacrifices of pasta every year to the Black Devil or the beasts would return.\u201d I shake my head in disbelief. \u201cIt was just a dumb prank. I figured you would just forget about the whole thing in a few years. How the actual fuck do you get from there to human sacrifice?!\u201d\n\nI can feel the cults looking around nervously. Not surprising really. I\u2019ve just revealed their entire religion to be a sham. \u201cLord Priest, he\u2019s lying, right?\u201d one timid girl asks.\n\nI see the man in the helmet furiously glare at her. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s lying! Can\u2019t you recognize how he mocks us?! But I\u2019m going to end his heresy right here and now!\u201d With one quick movement, he drove his knife through my throat.\n\nI glare at him as blood spews from the wound and gets all over my new jacket. \u201cDo you believe me now?\u201d",

            "comment": "\"Never ask me to paint you Picasso-style again.\" Klav said as he walked away from the stone wall, admiring the fresh, asymmetrical shouts of red and black adorning it.\n\n\"It was your fault for losing that bet.\" Diana commented, grinning, \"And don't worry, I won't. You're pretty shitty at it anyways.\" She inspected the grotesque piece as she added, \"For starters, my teeth aren't that big.\"\n\n\"What eye? It's just your silhouette!\" Klav closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, \"Look, I wasn't aiming for accuracy, I was aiming for efficiency. Don't you think this will get the job done?\"\n\nThe red-and-black humanoid pouted, \"You hurt my feelings, you really do. This mural was supposed to make me look threatening and big, yet I look just as intimidating as you! I really want to make you paint another one now... With proper teeth, at that.\" She insisted.\n\nAnd Klav wanted none of it. So many years of living hadn't taken out all of his energy yet, but his friend was definitely about to. He wouldn't have a midlife crisis, not now, so he had to think of an idea.\n\n\"Let's do something, okay? You know humanity is barely getting started in this planet, yes? They love seeing this kind of stuff.\" He said, pointing at his not-so-master piece, \"It makes them think there was something bigger before them, and they become obsessed with it.\" The somewhat-draconic god nodded slowly, yet not understanding where her friend was going to. \n\n\"So they'll end up worshipping you, even if this mural doesn't, uh, make you want to worship yourself.\" He glanced at his work one last time. It wasn't something extraordinary, really. In fact, it looked just like the ancient paintings found in the third iteration of Earth. Klav realized he needed to take non-neanderthal-issued painting lessons, he just had to find the time to. Diana questioned his statements before he realized he could've been taking them just now.\n\n\"Yeah, but the tributes for the other gods were different! You didn't make a crop circle, or a pyramid, or a massive book, or even a small poem! You just scribbled some scribbles and called it a day, and honestly they look hella blurry!\" Diana shook her head in disappointment.\n\n\"Oh yeah? Then why don't you paint one yourself?\" Klav snapped.\n\nThen, Diana was quiet. Awfully quiet. She didn't look at him as she whimpered, \"You know I don't know how to hold a pencil... I can't... That's why I wanted you to do it in the first place...\" She sniffled, but Klav knew better than to fall for it.\n\nDiana was a draconic, but her hands were very much like a human's. Her nails were very sharp, resembling claws, so most things she held broke easily, but she could always trim them. The fact she liked to draw anatomically-incorrect cats on them was another thing entirely.\n\nAnd Klav sighed. \"I have all time in the world, but I won't spend it arguing with you. Before I forget what I was trying to say, I'll make myself clear. Please let me finish,\" he added as Diana opened her mouth, her arms crossed, \"We'll settle a bet with another bet, okay? You know every planet's lifespan is usually a millenium long, right? And that's why every one-thousand years, a new planet is created somewhere else. Give me that thousand years to change your mind; If these folks don't try to summon you during their expected lifespan, I'll make another symbol in the newer planet. Remember that I'm altering the course of nature by doing this, and I could get in trouble if the other gods discovered me- EVEN IF you told them about it,\" he said before Diana could reply, \"so I'm risking myself not once, but twice. Deal?\"\n\nThe draconic was deep in thought for more than a minute, looking at her bizarre depiction on the wall as if it would give her an answer. To her own surprise, it gave her a question instead. \"...And if they do end up worshipping me? If they go as far as to summon me? ...You haven't told me what will happen then.\" She tilted her head, curious about whatever the immortal human from Iteration 1 had to say.\n\nHe grinned. Then he frowned. \"I was hoping you wouldn't ask.\" He cleared his throat, \"You'll do the Chicken Dance. I'll film it, and post it on EarthTube.\" he snickered, \"If you forgot, I'm talking about the famous 'meme' from Iteration 2, you can look at it later in your Council's Gadget.\"\n\nBut Diana didn't want to look at it later; just the name was enough to make her want to say no, so she wasn't taking any chances. She produced her device, and searched for the \"IT-2 highlights\" folder. Once she found it, she was surprised that the video was at the top, with billions of likes. The thumbnail didn't look any promising, but she still opened it. It loaded instantly, and Diana felt ashamed just by watching it. She wanted to spit infinite amounts of fire, both at the video, its creators, Klav, and the painting that only seemed to get uglier with every second. When the video finished, she was gasping in pain. It took her great amounts of pride to say \"Deal,\" and shake Klav's hand. Or at least try to, as the man retreated immediately after seeing her nails.\n\n\\-Part 2 in the replies-",

                    "comment": "999 years and 365 days had almost passed, and IT-7 had nothing but smooth progress. The planet wasn't showing any signs of decay and society was on the right path. Never had Klav felt so proud about just existing, and he couldn't stop smiling as he bought an icecream and sat before a fountain on The Seventh Park. That wasn't its name, but he had always liked to pick favorites out of every iteration. No matter how chaotic, every place had something good to offer. Something tangible or the opposite, it didn't matter. Not even loneliness was a problem for him when he had thousands of stories to tell. To put it simply, life was good.\n\nThat's why he felt surprised (afraid, even) when a giant figure approached him and injected him with something. His extraordinary body fell with a thud along with his consciousness, and the ice cream would forever stain the spot beside him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he came to his senses, he realized he was scared. For the first time in millenia, Klav felt afraid of what was to come. He couldn't die or age and he could suppress suffering, but the unpredictable was still above him. Above him, too, was a noose, and it didn't take long for Klav to realize that his neck was on it. As the fear slowly went away, he found it curious how humans were so repetitive. As a human himself he couldn't say he was above it all but, unlike them, he was there to presence it again and again. It was becoming boring. That's why acts like painting Diana's mural were--\n\nA figure wearing a black-and-red robe derailed his train of thought as it spoke in a language that was oddly unknown to him. 'Tryhards or wicked guys.' he thought as he realized he was surrounded by similar people, all of them doing a weird dance. The man who spoke approached him, and stared at him for a few seconds before kicking the stool Klav was stepping on. Usually, what would happen is that the noose would finish him off, but something strange happened.\n\nThe noose broke, and with it Klav fell for what felt like... a few feet, to be honest. He noticed something was painted on the floor, and he was lying down in the middle of it. When he stood up, he couldn't believe his eyes.\n\nThe grotesque painting he had long since forgotten about stared back at him with malicious intent. He stared at it, then at the figures, then at their robes. \n\n'They're worshipping Diana.'\n\nThe friend who Klav hadn't seen in what could be pretty much a thousand years was distantly waving back at him from ash and blood while the figures finished their dance. Once they did, a strange glow began enveloping the pseudo-Diana and, therefore, Klav himself. The glow felt warm and cozy... Then hot and dangerous. He could vaguely remind Diana saying something along the lines of \"Go to hell if they actually summon me, yeah?\" but... For the Seventh Humans to take it so literally... Was that even possible? \n\nHe detached himself from his senses as the fire became something no human was able to stand. And then he waited... and waited... and waited...\n\nDiana was supposed to be summoned, right? Was the ritual wrong? Was it because he hadn't died yet? That would be a problem, considering--\n\nA flying creature picked him up with sharp-nailed hands and began talking at the people in their same language, which Klav soon learned was Diana's inner monologue. They looked very pleased, and he most certainly seemed very scared. Diana couldn't look at him from their current position, so she started flying upwards. That way, she could find a place to talk with her not-old-but-old friend and catch up... And maybe apologize. \n\n\"Hey Diana, it's been a while.\" Klav said, gasping for air, both because of panic and the altitude.\n\n\"Hi Klav, you look great... not.\" Diana didn't have to look at him any more, the guy hadn't aged, but he looked tired. Just tired. Especially as his 43rd murder attempt took place. 'Immortals don't have bad luck, but he does' she thought.\n\n\"You say that while I wasn't even burned... I'm glad I'm not the one who's going to look great in front of the Universe Council in a while.\" \n\n\"Shut up, or I'll drop you. I'll have you know I'd definitely look great regardless of what silly dance I did. Besides, those guys summoned me today, May 6th, one day before you painted the origin of that... thing on the floor right now!\" She grunted, \"\"But that doesn't mean you won, because guess what? This year is a leap year, so today is technically May 7th, rendering the bet pointless! HA!\" She taunted, even if she had no physical way to.\n\nAnd Klav, after being in silence for a couple of seconds, laughed in a somewhat terrifying way. \"You're forgetting one important detail... The day my painting took place was, too, a leap year. We specified the time gap to be a millenium, so exactly 250 leap years have gone by! Therefore, the bet still stands. In other words...\" there was a brief pause as Klav released one of his hands from Diana's, to do something specific they both were aware of. It wasn't long until a certain, annoying tune filled the air.\n\nAfter a long silence and an ungodly amount of tension, accompanied only by the sound of accordions and a video only Klav could see, the draconic god made a decision.\n\nFor the second time that day, Klav fell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading, and I hope you liked it! I had a lot of fun with this prompt, and it's my first time writing so, if you want to, please tell me what aspects you'd like to see improved in the future. I'd also really appreciate it if anyone wanted to point out spelling mistakes, because I'm not a native speaker. See you around!",

            "comment": " Franklin awoke.  He was seated on a dirt floor, his back to an earthen wall.There was a burlap sack pulled down over his head.  He had been stripped naked.  Through the sack over his eyes, he could see a bare bulb hanging from a wire in the middle of the room.  \n  \u201cAh, shit,\u201d he said quietly to himself.  \n  The sack was ripped from his head.  The man who removed it was wearing a black, floor length robe.  From beneath the hood, a high pitched giggle.   \n  \u201cSo good of you to join us, honored guest!\u201d said the cloaked figure.   \n  \u201cYeah, hi,\u201d said Franklin.  \u201cListen, I-\u201d   \n  The hooded man produced a tiny knife from the sleeve of his hood.  Brandishing it towards the ceiling, he resumed chanting, joining the circle of cultists under the bare bulb.  In the center of the circle was a pentagram, etched into a stone slab.  The other cultists, as one, drew their own knives.   \n  \u201cGuys, seriously!  Stop!\u201d   \n  The cultists, in unison, slashed open their hands, the spilling blood filled the pentagram.  The bulb over the stone slab began to vibrate.   \n  \u201cHEY!!\u201d shouted Franklin, over the rising chant.  Two of the cultists left the circle and grabbed Franklin, pulling him up roughly.  The vibrating bulb burst, and in the darkness left behind, a feint red glow began to emanate from the stone slab.   \n  Franklin was done protesting.  They never listened.   \n  \u201cHONORED SACRIFICE!\u201d   \n  Franklin recognized the voice of the giggler from before.  He must be the poor sap who'd found that book and roped his friends and family into finding a \u201csacred vessel\u201d... they always found him.   \n  \u201cWITH YOUR BLOOD SACRIFICE, WE OPEN THE PORTAL TO MEET OUR TRUE SAVIOR!\u201d screamed the giggler.  The two cultists pulled Franklin's body across the glowing pentagram.  Franklin sighed in resignation.  The giggler plunged his knife into Franklin's belly and pulled it across.  Blood and entrails spilled across the stone slab, and the red glow surged.  Electricity crackled across the room, and suddenly bolts of lightening began shooting up from the slab, each finding one of the chanting cultists.  They died instantly, ready to meet their God.  Only the giggler remained, having not told his followers that Franklin wasn't the only sacrifice.  More lightening crackled, hanging in the air between the floor and ceiling, then dividing into two streams.  Between them, a portal began to form, coalescing into a clear, perfect circle.  Black fog spilled out.  From inside the portal, a voice:   \n  \u201cWHO OPENS A DOOR TO MY REALM, OUTSIDE OF TIME AND REALITY?\u201d   \n  \u201cI DO!\u201d screamed the giggler.   \n  From below the portal, Franklin loudly cleared his throat.   \n  \u201cWHO SPEAK-  OH, HEY FRANK, IS THAT YOU?\u201d   \n  \u201cYeah Jim, it's me.\u201d   \n  Franklin swung his arms, pulling himself into a sitting position, his guts still hanging loosely all over his torso.   \n  \u201cAH SHIT, DID IT HAPPEN AGAIN?\u201d   \n  \u201cDon't be like that.  You know it's not-\u201d   \n  The booming voice from inside the portal began to laugh jovially.  The giggler looked on, utterly confused.   \n  \u201cHOW DO THEY KEEP FINDING THE PROPHECY?!\u201d  the voice boomed through the portal, barely holding back more laughter.   \n  \u201cI don't know, man.  Every time I hide it, they find it.  Like clockwork.\u201d   \n  \u201cLIKE CLOCKWORK!\u201d repeated the voice, cackling.  The giggler slumped to his knees.   \n  \u201cListen, fairs fair, you won the bet.  You won the bet 6 times.  Can we please stop doing this?\u201d pleaded Franklin.  \n  \u201cNO WAY, SHITHEEL,\" boomed the voice.  \"WE'RE GONNA KEEP THIS TRAIN ROLLING A FEW MORE MILLENNIA!\u201d   \n  \u201cFuck off,\u201d said Franklin, standing on the stone slab, his entrails snaking down his legs to the floor.  \n  \u201cALRIGHT FRANK, WE'LL SEE YOU.  GIVE MY BEST TO LILITH.\u201d   \n  \u201cWill do, thanks Jim!\u201d said Franklin.  With that, Franklin's eyes rolled into the back of his head.  He said several words in a long dead language, spoken not by beast nor man,  words that made the giggler, a sobbing mess in the corner of his parent's unfinished basement, feel as though spiders were crawling across the inside of his skull.  The portal snapped shut with a crack of lightening.  The room fell to pitch darkness.   \n  \u201cYou got a phone?\u201d called Franklin in the darkness.  The whimpering cultists did not reply.   \n  \u201cHey, dumbass!  Do you have your cell on you?\u201d   \n  Still no reply.  Franklin sighed in the darkness, then gathered up his guts as best he could and followed the sound of stifled crying to the desperate idiot to the corner of the room.  Franklin knelt down and began rummaging through the cultist's robe, eventually finding an iPhone.   \n  \u201cJackpot,\u201d said Franklin, waking the phone and flipping on it's flashlight.  He leaned back into a sitting position and shined the light onto the robed figure, cowering at his feet.   \n  \u201cWhat's your name?\u201d   \n  \u201cW-What?\u201d sputtered the giggler.  \n  \u201cYour name, asshole!\u201d yelled Franklin.   \n  \u201cK-Kevin!\u201d   \n  \u201cOkay Kevin.  Gimme the book.\u201d   \n  \u201cB-but...\u201d   \n  \u201cTHE BOOK,\u201d boomed Franklin, in a voice that somewhat exceeded the bounds of the body he was currently occupying.  Kevin fumbled in his robe and produced a small, black book.  Franklin snatched it away from him.   \n  \u201cWhere'd you find it?\u201d   \n  \u201cAt sch-sch-school,\u201d blubbered Kevin, snot running from his nose.   \n  \u201cSeriously?\u201d said Franklin, looking down at the book.  \u201cI told you to hide yourself where no one would find you and you get picked up by a kid in high school?\u201d   \n  Franklin made a series of intricate gestures, then tossed the book gently onto the ground.  As it fell, two tiny legs sprouted from its spine, and it ran off the find the basement stairs and hide itself.  *What can I do,* Franklin thought to himself.  *There are too many people these days.*  \n  Franklin returned his attention to Kevin, absentmindedly playing with his exposed appendix with his left hand.  \u201cHow old are you, Kevin?\u201d   \n  \u201cSe-Seventeen,\u201d whimpered Kevin.   \n  \u201cNot a cool move, Kevin, sacrificing a stranger and several of your friends... and your parents...\u201d   \n  \u201cSkarethanguinestaliarion was to grant me power beyond imagination!\u201d   \n  \u201cYeah, Jim doesn't do that anymore.  Granting that kind of power to humans tends to end badly for... everybody.\u201d   \n  \u201cB-But the holy text-\u201d   \n  \u201cLook, the book... short version, I had to make it because of a prank.  Me and Jim and a few other guys were hanging out, I made a dumb bet and lost, so now , every once in a while, someone finds the book, and then finds me, and we go through this whole thing all over again.\u201d   \n  \u201cIs Jim his real name...?\u201d   \n  \u201cThat's your takeaway?\u201d said Franklin, exasperated.  \u201cNo!\u201d   \n  \u201cIs it Skarethang-\u201d   \n  \u201cIt's not that either.\u201d   \n  \u201cWell then what is it?\u201d asked Kevin, shifting somehow from abject horror to indignant curiosity.  \n  \u201cYou *suuuuure* you want to know?\u201d asked Franklin, coyly.   \n  \u201cYeah, I want to know!  Tell me!\u201d   \n  \u201cOkay!\u201d  said Franklin, standing up.  He leaned forward and said Jim's true name, the name of an elder god more powerful than the cosmos could contain.  Kevin's brain imploded as his skull burst into flames.  Every blood vessel in his body burst at once as his blood boiled into steam in an instant.  Within seconds, his bones had dissipated into dust.  The holocaust robe he'd sewn in home ec class five weeks ago billowed to the dirt.  Franklin put the robe on and tied the waist tightly enough to hold up his loosely gathered internal organs so they wouldn't drag on the ground, giving him a slightly pregnant look.  \n  \u201cWhat a day,\u201d sighed Franklin, making his way up the stairs.  Pretending to be a mortal could be such a pain.  But it was an undeniably more interesting way to spend eternity.",

            "comment": "You'd think that when you've lived as long as I have there would be little left to surprise you. Ive seen the best and worst of what existence has to offer. Ive lived through, even died from some of the worst atrocities dealt by man, stuff that would haunt your every waking hour till you finally bit the dust. Though fortunately for me death is less of a permanent issue than most. Should I meet some kind of fatal encounter I find it to be more like a nice long power nap, usually followed by an awkward encounter with some poor mortician poking at my pale corpse. \n\nMind you it wasn't always this way. I too was once burdened by the chains of mortality, doomed to die just like anyone else. Turns out, taking a gamble with other worldly beings of unimaginable powers can have its perks. It is not a method of obtaining godly abilities that I would recommend; many other souls have met grizzly consequence from messing with beings beyond their comprehension. Some days I ponder if my earnings of immortality were truly a blessing or a curse, though when it comes to winning a bet against an arrogant god and thoroughly embarrassing him in front of his circle of deities, I guess you cant be too picky.\n\nWe've been bickering on and off for countless centuries now; his injured pride is as persistent as my immortality. Recently I've had a few good decades free of divine interruption, which has been very nice, so you can imagine my surprise when I awoke groggy and dazed in a dark chamber, my limbs sprawled across a stone table held by rusting chains and a familiar chanting sound invading my still ringing ears. Definitely not the place I was expecting to wake up in after a night of clubbing. Funny enough its not the first time, but something about it always makes my heart pick up a few paces and makes my throat feel like a desert. \n\nThe chanting has grown louder and more urgent, and while my head is heavy and likely locked in place, I don't have to see the creeping flames to know my impending fate as a crispy husk. I can hear him, he fills the chamber with his bellowing laughter that rattles in my bones, like he's won. And perhaps, in his perspective, this all too familiar encounter is a small victory. I may always be able to evade death, but there is one thing that will never change, one edge this bastard will always have. Fear, human fear, is what will always separate me from the gods, no matter how many years go by. The world is terrifying as it is beautiful, and I am witness to her unending gospel. That is why he laughs, why he mocks me and will continue his harmless \"pranks\" for all eternity. My soul is human, trapped in impervious skin.\n\nThe flames now lap at my finger tips, hungry heat against my flesh. It's gonna hurt, just like all the other times. I'll likely scream, maybe beg for help just to humor the watchful god. There is nothing to enjoy in this, but I'll go down with a smile on my face. For while the present is wrought with suffering, the future belongs to me, and I'll be waiting the next round, however many eons it takes, with that same smile plastered on my face. \n\n//\n\nIt's short, it's meh, it's quickly slapped together, but it's written and done. Im trying to motivate myself more to just write as much as I can no matter how small. Any criticism and feedback is happily welcomed! Thank you for reading!",

Be grateful that you were chosen for this, you finally have a purpose in your life!\"\n\nx\n\nThe ritual began on the undergrounds of the M25 London Orbital. This place was the centrepiece of their worship after all this is the direct action of their \"God\".\n\nThe ritual was to summon their God, of course, they're trying to get its power and bless them. So the ritual had to have a sacrifice to lure it in, first the sacrifice must be a virgin, then it must be physically and mentally sound. The former was harder than the latter.\n\nUnder the orbital there is a pit of lava, It was said to be their \"Gods\" favoured way of sacrifice. What they don't know is that it simply was just accident waiting to happen, set by their \"God\".\n\nThey began to prepare the sacrifice.\n\nx\n\nThe sacrifices day was going swimmingly, He tended to his bookstore, bought some flowers, then drank some tea. He noticed the people following him around of course. He even knew that his friend was a comrade of those following him, but he paid it no mind. He simply thought that she was being protective.\n\n\"Silly Humans,\" he thought, \"Like I need protection. But It's the thought that counts I suppose.\"\n\nHis friend had always talked about joining a fan club, again he paid it no mind, He quite liked this female. She was a good person to talk to.\n\nx\n\nThe \"God\" s day was going great as well, a few meetings had to go and shoot a show, and after he tended to his plants, He never forgets to take care of his plants. Living there had gotten a bit boring, the show was a great way to take his mind of things and his \"friends\" did say he'd look good as a doctor.\n\nHis day was ruined however by a call from his followers, he liked fans of course as any famous person do, but this one is a bit more...personal.\n\nx\n\n\"Right what's all this then!\"\n\n\"Praise our God for he has arrived! We offer this sacrifice for you our dark one!\"\n\na man with his eyes covered, ears blocked and hands and feet tied together were brought forward.\n\n\"Accept our sacrifice!\"\n\nThe man's blindfold was removed.\n\n\"I'd say this club of yours have some interesting way of having fun...\"\n\n**\"AZIRAPHALE!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!\"**\n\n**\"CROWLEY?! Is this revenge for trapping you in that TV show fiasco?! I'm terribly sorry about it.\"**\n\n**\"****^(FUCK!!)****\"**\n\nand now their day had gotten more interesting.\n\nxxxxx\n\nEdit: typo",

            "comment": "I smile lazily at the man dressed in all black. He\u2019s standing over me in a manor humans would describe as threatening. Instead, though, I find his puny hold of power almost too hilarious to keep a hold on.\n\nI pull on the iron chains, testing them roughly. I can almost feel them bend. My smile widens and the man stares down at me, the mask the only thing that isn\u2019t black. \n\nMy voice is strong in the painted concrete room, \u201cMy man, I could\u2019ve sworn I said thick iron chains.\u201d I pull my hand up, snapping the metal easily, \u201cDoes that look thick to you? It should be able to hold down a god and I\u2019d be surprised if it could hold one of my sons down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWh-Who are you?\u201d The man\u2019s voice questions. He seems much more anxious than he was previously. \n\n\u201cI came down to see how all the people are doing and here you are, still doing the same things since I started this with the Roanokes. Hell, I forgot you people existed. What\u2019s the point of chaining me up? Did my buddy get enough of this prank or are you still doing this for him?\u201d I say, pulling my other wrist out of the pathetic chains and cracking my neck, sitting up on the cold sacrificial table.\n\nHe steps back, \u201cWho...\u201d\n\nMy grin turns devilish, one could say, and I snap the chains around my feet, \u201cI didn\u2019t answer it the first time, boy. Why would I answer it when you ask again? For right now. I want you to put that poor needle down and go live a normal life. Hades probably doesn\u2019t want any more \u2018sacrifices\u2019 to add to his list of people he needs to process into the Underworld.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat... that chain was two inches thick. How\u2014\u201c\n\nI interrupt, \u201cChild, I was tied to a mountain with chains forged from my kids\u2019 intestines. If I can\u2019t break through two inches of metal. I need to pay my respects to them. Better yet, where are the candles? No sacrifice is right without a candle. I thought I taught your ancestors better. I mean, I showed them how to disappear and asked them to leave a message for my buddy but I would\u2019ve thought they were found and killed.\u201d\n\nI stand up, towering over his small and wiry frame. I grab the atham\u00e9 and snap it in half like a twig, \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of technology out there. Quite living in the dark ages for everybody\u2019s sake. Hades is swamped with this new thing that may or may not be humans fault.\u201d\n\nI pause in front of the chamber door, \u201cOh you have friends. I guess this is where shapeshifting has it\u2019s perk.\u201d\n\nHe scrambles to pick up what\u2019s left of the knife as I change my form to my favorite animal, a wolf. It\u2019s what I came to the Roanoke colony as and what I left them as. Anybody with a semblance of an idea of the history would know me for what I am.\n\n\u201cLord Loki?\u201d The small man asks, fear lighting in his eyes. \n\nI sit, my black fur standing out against my red irises. I reach for his mind, changing my voice back to the deep baritone that it\u2019s always been. I had changed my appearance to a modern human\u2019s so I could blend and see the havoc that they did to themselves, black hair cut short and clean. My eyes were a dark brown, the same color as what my real hair is naturally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I was called Loki. Your kind listened to me once before, listen to me again. I would imagine you\u2019re the leader, since you were the one dumb enough to try and sacrifice me to one of two gods who put up with me. Tell the others that Hades took your pathetic offering and said that you had fulfilled your duty.\u201d \n\nI open the door, walking out as an animal that scares the two men guarding the soundproof area. As I reach the edge of their hidden temple, I add, \u201cAnd say I was the hellhound he gave you in thanks.\u201d\n\nI walk into the forest, breathing in deeply and morphing back into a humanoid body. This time, I shift to a woman that people will hopefully find irresistible. I\u2019m the god of tricks, why not have some fun with some unsuspecting men for a while? I did my good deeds for the day. Now I get to play.",

            "comment": "'Oh fuck me, what have I gotten myself into this time?' Was the only thought currently running through my mind. Why, you may ask? Well, it all started around four thousand years ago, me and a close friend of mine, we'll just call him \"Jesus,\" to keep things simple. We decided to pull a little prank on humanity. Honestly, we were just bored, like idiotic teenagers tend to be and well, we decided why not start our own little tradition? We would \"guess\" when animals, or humans, of course, were going to die, grant enlightened advice, absolutions and such to those we deemed humble and kind enough to receive such gifts. We knew all these things were correct of course, we knew when all living things would die, we knew which path would lead any given man or woman to their best life. Before long, he wanted to grant bigger blessings, like this one time, he healed a crippled man, a cripple! Made him walk again! That was a *huge* no no amongst all the God's, and he knew it. Humans absolutely could not know of divinity, they were too simple, too narrow minded, but he took that as an excuse to use his powers, suggesting they wouldn't think him a God, well, guess who was wrong. You guessed it, that guy. It wasn't long before the entire world knew about him, knew about his powers, and because of him I had to hide in the shadows, especially after hearing about them nailing him to a cross, I mean who even does that to a God? Of course he couldn't fight back, it was against the rules to kill humans of our own volition, and doing so would have stripped him of his standing as a God, he'd have been cast out. So, he waited a few days, let the humans *think* he was dead, and left, leaving me with his stinking mess! Of course most of his followers are fine, honest, kind folk, who feed puppies and tend to those down on their luck, truly kind, wonderful people, though I did say, most... There were some who were truly heinous, monsterous, beasts in human skin who didn't belong on this Earth, much less amongst others so that they could spread their hatred and prejudice. Those were the kind who I was currently dealing with, as two of them were dragging me through a dark alley. One on my right, one on my left, both holding to my biceps, as my legs slid limp behind me. I may be an immortal, and every bit as powerful as any other God, but no matter what happens, I am unable to use my power against a human, for any reason. I felt my consciousness fading in and out, they'd beaten me black and blue, though that was just a show, my wounds would heal within the hour, no doubt several already had. And that, is what brings me to my most pressing dilema: *humans can't know of divinity.* Yes Jesus may have cured a cripple, and come back from the dead, but that was long ago, before humans had developed technology, before they could communicate instantly with someone on the other side of the world. Before they could record a video with their precious smart phones, and plaster it on the internet for the whole world to see. If they were to kill me, like I knew they planned to, I would not die, I would be cast out, I would be stripped of divinity, no longer able to pass through the golden gates. Slowly, the dark curtains fell, as I slipped into unconsciousness, for the first time in well over a millennia, fearing, what the future may hold.",

            "comment": "If only I had not taken that strange looking turn I\u2019d be out of this mess in a jiffy, so much for being adventurous and retracing old steps, I wonder hung upside down in a cave inside a volcano and being put in the sacrificial pyre in front of a statue which looks a lot like my buddy Vesuvius. And well why should it not look like Ves, these people here think he\u2019s their God, and while he is a God he\u2019s not in the way they\u2019re thinking it. Let me explain, my name is Skiver and I am one of the 3 men who drank the water from the elixir of immortality at the dawn of time. We all have had different names across different cultures and mythologies and have been basically around since forever doing the whole immortal men travel the planet kind of gig. Our skirmishes with mortal men, who more often than not overestimate their own abilities, has become folklore. Most times people just do it out of their need for a good story. The closest word modern mythology has for us would have to be \u2018demigods\u2019, but with time our powers have waned and now we just have the immortality aspect coupled with perhaps very high damage endurance. \n\nIn the old days, our modus operandi always were to hijack the public favour in any new city we travelled to, through charlatan and parlour tricks (well they were parlour tricks to us) and become the public\u2019s heroes so that we could live out our time there being treated as royalty. This one time we got to the Roman City of Pompeii situated right next to a very active volcano. Now being around since the dawn of time brings unsurmountable amounts of knowledge which includes manually triggering a volcano. It is unwittingly simple as well, you just have to add the tiniest amount of garlic to the flames inside the volcano and the volcano takes over. If you think about it sounds an awful lot like how a human sneezes. After the explosion, Ves and I would go save the people from the lava and be hailed as heroes. But I miscalculated the amount of garlic powder needed, we needed just a tablespoon but I put almost a cup and the result was that the explosion was a lot more aggressive than we anticipated knocking me unconscious, leaving Ves, who was waiting for me at the city gates, to do the heavy lifting and fail gloriously at saving the city. He did try though and saved a handful of people who may have, as I am now discovering, started an eternal devotion group for Ves surviving across centuries. Ugh, there\u2019s no good way to say it, and I was being kind with \u201ceternal devotion group\u201d, these lunatics are a cult, they call themselves the Children of Vesuvius. Such has been their clout that even the culprit volcano is named after Vesuvius. Ves has always been sketchy about what he revealed to the rescued about who he is. Slimy Bastard, he told them he\u2019s God or well, a God. I will say I\u2019m impressed by how long these guys have stuck around. Pompeii was if I am remembering correctly around 80 AD in the biblical calendar and we are currently in, if I\u2019d venture a guess, 1941? The level of indoctrination it would have required to keep up the myth of Vesuvius going across generations would be monumental. To these people here today Vesuvius is not just a God, it is an integral part of what their identity is based around, no wonder they are happily willing to sacrifice a living human being (from their perspective). Well if the social science class I took was any good then I am afraid I am not going to be able to reason my way out of here with these people.\n\nI am not sure what their rationale is over sacrificing me but if I were to guess I\u2019d say \u201cblessings from thy lord\u201d, at least that was what it was the last time I was in such a situation. I don\u2019t mind being put in the pyre, I have done a lot of misdeeds over my long life and this seems like the right kind of retribution for it, but sadly for them it won\u2019t kill me and the ash would just get in my clothes, I would hate for it to ruin my brand new suit. Additionally, my skin would get itchy and it is bloody difficult to find a dermatologist for a thousand-year-old former demigod. I suppose it\u2019s time to end my musings and embrace my fate. Halloween is around the corner so I can possibly get by another week with the burnt skin regenerating and the grotesque skeleton appearance healing. Well, here it comes. \n\n\\*Skiver is consumed by the embers, he squeals in pain and consequently becomes unconscious, the Children of Vesuvius sing together in prayer and then are forced to hurriedly leave the area. Skiver awakes by the coast, a few weeks later, naked and most of his skin now burnt. He looks around to find the entire area has been ravished by the volcano again\\*\n\nLooks like I miscalculated the garlic powder I needed again. Well third time\u2019s the charm.",

They were discussing roles of the meeting, everyone seemed to want to stab me, but they finally decided it was the job of a young girl. She was puny, small, not more than 10 years old for sure. Her long, wavy, brown hair reaching her knees, her bright blue eyes. As blue as the seas. I recognized her to be a bastard child of my friend. A demigod, as some would say. She was the only one who didn't want to do it, knowing it had great consequences. My continuosly more bored and less caring reminders that I was immortal and thus the touch of my blood would doom them all didn't seem to have an effect.\n\nThe sound of deep drums filled the air. It was time. They dragged me up a flight of stairs to an altar room and tied me down again, kneeling towards the altar. Removing the bag from my head, like it would've made any sort of a difference, they lifted my head up, revealing my neck to be slit open. \"I am Hermes, your god, and this is my final warning. My ichor will stain you and mark your doom in the hands of the olympian gods.\" She was shaking. The beautiful child of Athena, trembling, knowing well not to do anything to me. Her hesitation angered the ceremonial master, \"Do your part, Alia.\" The girl didn't move, prompting the master to do it himself. He could barely scratch my skin, but as the small bit of ichor, a god's golden blood, that he managed to carve out tainted his hand the roof of the entire place collapsed, setting everything on fire.\n\nIt was Hephaestus, coming to check on me. I stood up breaking each chain immidiately and walked out of there all happy, giving them a last good bye of \"I told you!~\" I turned to Hephaestus \"That was a fun millenia! My turn to dare you.\" I leaned in close with a smug grin on my face, he recoiled a bit. \"I dare you to build some cool advanced tech. Let's start an alien conspiracy club!\" Hephaestus sighed and a grin rose on his face with a nod.",

I'm sure that I'm the first to be in this situation, and I'm even more sure I won't be the last.\n\nAnd yet, I can't stop smiling. Death? Death doesn't scare me. Not anymore. When you've spent thousands of years wandering spiritual and physical realms, staring death in the face is the only real way you can live. \n\nAnd this will be especially fun. Cults might just be some of the most interesting things this race has created. Experience has taught me that until I finally die in a particularly interesting way, I'll learn all sorts of poppycock about whatever miracles they claim to have seen, and the strange rituals that they perform to honour a god they know nothing about. It's always fascinating stuff. \n\n\"In your honour, Almighty Leo, we sacrifice this deviant, so that we may continue to prosper with your blessing, and maintain our purity until your return.\"\n\nHe turns back to face the crowd. \"Bring forth the sacred vinegar jug!\"\n\nVinegar jug? Almighty Leo? Sacrifice everyone foreign to maintain purity? No way... \"As you know...\"\n\nOh my goodness, these cretins actually believed him...\n\nThe priest is still talking. Probably about why I'm about to get doused with holy vinegar and then thrown into an empty volcano. But he stops. Because I've started laughing.\n\nThis is bad. But I don't stop. I can't. This... is just too good.\n\nThe tribespeople are becoming confused. The priests are getting irritated. If only they knew that the basis of 800 years of their culture was created through a night of heavy drinking and stupid dares. Maybe they would be laughing too.\n\n\n\"I choose dare. What have you got for me, Cassius?\"\n\n\"Leo, I dare you to visit a realm, and convince a group of creatures that you're a god, and they should worship you. You can say whatever you want, with one condition: those creatures have to sacrifice their own kind in your name.\"\n\n\nAnd I happened to stumble upon the result... this is too good. He has to see this. \"Hey, Leo! You there?\"\n\nThe sky starts to turn grey. The trees shake, more violently by the second. And out of the clouds, a familiar face greets me.\n\n\"Holy shit! Cassius, is that you?\"\n\nUpon hearing his voice, the tribe collapses to their knees. Not that Leo feels the need to say anything to his loyal followers.\n\n\"You know it! So, this was the place where the magic happened?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Picked a random universe, worked out the dominant species, found an island in the middles of nowhere, and told some people to start worshipping. How did you even end up here?\"\n\n\"The usual fare... plane crash, build a raft, turns out the land I find is full of crazy people.\"\n\n\"Well... it's nice to see you, Cassius. We should catch up again sometime.\"\n\n\"We really should, Leo. Anyway, I think I need to be sacrificed about now, so take care. Say hi to Jenny for me!\"\n\n\"Will do, Cassius. See you around.\"\n\nLeo's face disappears into the clouds. The world arounds me settles back down, but the tribespeople grow more restless. I get it. That's the reaction to be expected when you meet your god. But I'm just smiling. It's all I can really do at this point.",

            "comment": "One drop of water kept falling from the ceiling. It's amazing that after all this years, the best ways for torturing people keep being the same. Empires have fallen, Technology now dominates us and yet, here I am again with this water drop drilling your forehead in this dark room, tied by something I can't really tell what it is from my arms and legs.\n\nThe pain in my belly reminds me I haven't ate in maybe a day or two. I remembering ordering something, but apps tend to cancel if the drop by is to far away. I actually really dislike Chinese food. It's been years without actually a good piece of bread. Nothing like the old days. Everything was simpler when I helped the Master. He studied plants and it's properties. He discovered that some of them could alter your perception of things. The first Drugs. I wish I was high so it could scare the pain away.\n\nThe door opened and a hooded figure entered the room. \nI tried to say something but I now realize my mouth is also tied. \nHe doesn't say anything, he unties me and signals me to follow him. He is stupidly tall and athletic, his attire is a pair of dark jeans, some black industrial boots, black sweatshirt with his hoodie and a mask with that stupid sign again. \n\nPulling any sign of resistance is going to end with me suffering even more, I know how this is going to end; I understand that following him is the best choice.\nIf we look at the bright side, i might have a chance to speak with the old man. Sometimes he appears, sometimes he doesn't.\n\nMy arms and legs hurt so much. This used to be much more special and unique, they had special robes, special locations, torches and candles. Know there's this house with wood everywhere, some kind of cabin perhaps. I can't see very well and my steps are  slow because my legs are sore. The old man is an idiot. I don't know how he had such a charming boy. His son was so pure and innocent. His death still hurts me. And he blames me for it.\n\nI met his son while i was working with my master. He told me that he needed help for people to believe him so he could help them get to the old man. I thought he was an idiot, but I saw him day after day preaching the same stuff and people being mean to him so figured out it would be fun to have the town believing him. So I poured the wells with Mandragora, and another hallucinating herbs and everyone was so high they imagined a lot of things when he preached.\nThey saw him walking on water, multiplying fishes and food, healing people that weren't even I'll to beging with and then they formed a cult on him.\nI laughed a shit ton over it and befriended him, because he was so happy I never told them about the drugs. One day my master passed away and I had to bury him in Egypt. I honored him and placed it's remnants as he wished, where he was born. \n\nI stayed there for years untill I heard about the political fuss. I saw that he became a religious figure and was menacing the government. So I tried to warn him, I wrote him letters that  couldn't reach him but I found out later someone else received them. Days later I found out the son of the old man was murdered.\n\nWe arrive to what appears to have been a living room, now with that stupid sign again in the floor made by candles and plants. At least this has stayed consistent throughout the years. I know what this idiots are going to do, so I just put myself in the center with my arms and legs extended so they can search for my arteries and bleed me \"to death\". And here we're all going to stay a day or two untill they get tired of this. Last time it was only 8 hours, maybe I get to have the same luck.\n\nThe first time that I met the old man was a little after his son was murdered. He appeared right in front of me and punched me so hard I fell. Tall, athletic, white beard and long hair, brown skin, omminent voice.\n-You've disgraced my son, you will pay for your sins.\nAnd since that day I haven't aged. I haven't died. I've been checked by millions of doctors and even became one myself in recent times and found out my cells have a godlike adaptability to endure damage and reproduce themselves so fast that I can't die.\n\nAs a result of this, people started to notice. They found out my letters to the old man's son. Their cult became so big it fractioned into a billion other mini-cults some really good ones, and then this pieces of shit that wanted to meet the old man at any cost in hopes of harvesting it's power, falling into stupid beliefs, that any object or person in contact with him could be a way to reach him.\nI've been haunted for them through all my life, and generations after generations greed and stupidly is present everytime. \n\n11 people as usual arrive, they prepare themselves and start chanting, 4 of them kneel and open my skin. The one on my right arm shakes so much that it hurts even more. Just as I feel the pain making me pass out I hear him.\n\n\"Ezra\" Loud and clear. It's been so much time that I almost forgot how the old man sounded like. \n\n\"... Yahv\u00e9 ?\" I asked\n\n\" It is time Ezra\" he replied immediately.\n\n\"Time for what? \u00bfHave you been following what this assholes have done to me all this years? \" I angrily yelled at him with all my strength\n\n\" I told you you were going to suffer the fate of my son over and over again\" he said calmly\n\n\"You never listened to me you arrogant piece of shit, It was a joke that went out of my hands, I never intended for him to be murdered or disrespect him\" I continued to shout\n\n\"You disgraced my son, Ezra. I wasn't going to listen to anything. But after all this years I'm more upset with other people in the world than you. So tell me. What happened?\" He asked\n\n\" I got really depressed by your son's death. I went to pay my respects to him and catched up with his followers. As a way of cheering us up I got high as fuck and began telling them how cool your son was, so I told them the drugs helped me remember them. They also got high and then we started drinking wine an everything was worse.  Someone had this idea that we could resucitate him and we opened his grave and made the corpse drink and party with us.\"\n\n\"I woke up the next day with a horrible pain, the worst I had ever experienced before. I was the first one to be awake,  saw the corpse and realized the terrible things that had happened, so I stole it and buried him elsewhere. Left the town so ashamed of myself. \nNext thing I know this morons believe that he was resurrected and he had apparitions and shit\" I finished\n\n\"I know Ezra. My son told me everything. He is not an idiot. He just wanted to return the prank\" he calmly replied\n\nFor a moment everything blurred out. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I was certain that my mind went insane or something like that. I couldn't ask the old man to repeat itself. \n\n\"Wh....What?\" I asked\n\n\" The plants you gave them did exacerbate and exaggerate my son's gifts. But they were very real. The only power he didn't have it's coming back to life. No one can do that, not even me. He was upset with you because you accelerated the ruin of his experiment with humans by creating a twisted religion. He has taken care of you and the Earth, protecting them from those crazy idiots trying to murder you. However you have served a very special purpose that you will fulfill one last time, since you were after all, his friend\" the old mans voice said in a lightly tone. \n\nI couldn't believe it. I couldn't even talk\n\n\"I....I didn't expect this at all, I...am confused...., What's this all have to do with me?\" I mumbled.\n\n\"My child has put in your cells the antidotes for every pandemic humanity has faced over the years. Every time that you have been tortured you release the antidote and spread it in the world. This time you will pour the last antidote for the greatest plague on earth.\" The old man said\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked\n\n\"You will come with us Ezra, you are going to extinguish Humanity themselves. Let go, your cells are ready. Come and rest Erza\"\n\nI sensed my last breaths. I sensed my last heartbeats. The last time my blood got to my brain and allowed me to think this sentence. And I let go.",

After seeing the performers\u2019 mind-blowing act, she had to know how they did it for her shows. While she was sneaking around after the show, someone snuck up behind her with a sack over her head. Now, she hung before cult-like gathering.\n\nUsing her crowd scanning skill, Gia counted 30 people in bright clown nose red robes with white plastic masks of a cartoonishly broad smile. The outfit vaguely reminded Gia of a production she put on with some friends, but what that was was a hazy memory.\n\n\u201cWe are gathered together here under the first full moon of the new decade for our sacrifice,\u201d the cult leader announced. Gai recognized the voice belonged to the ringleader. \n\nThe crowd cheered. The only thing Gia could spot on the cult leader that made him stand out from the others was the golden inverted pyramid necklace.\n\n\u201cSacrifice, huh?\u201d Gia said with excited curiosity. \u201cIf I may make a suggestion, the lighting is awful. How are people going to see me die? Do you have anything else other than the torchlights like some portable LED stage lights? Surely you got some of those.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can see well enough,\u201d the cult leader grumbled.\n\n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Gia snarked. \u201cBy the way, what\u2019s your cult or organization or whatever\u2019s name? Or is this some tradition with your circus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the Cult of Mischief,\u201d the leader proclaimed. \n\nGia remembered the show she was trying to pin down earlier. She giggled like she was part of an inside joke.\n\nThe leader picked up the jewel-encrusted ceremonial dagger from a pedestal and pointed it at Gia. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ll find out. Carry on.\u201d\n\nThe leader faced the crowd. \u201cLet the ceremony commence!\u201d\n\nWith the crowd cheering, the leader stabbed Gia in the chest. Silence fell. \n\n\u201cOh, what cruel world,\u201d Gia cried out. \u201cThere was so much I wanted to do. There\u2019s so much in this world I wanted to see. But now, my time has come. Farewell.\u201d\n\nGia\u2019s body went limp. The cultists chanted in unison, \u201cOur sacrifice is yours. Take this soul and bless us.\u201d\n\nPer cult order, the youngest member pulled out the knife from the sacrifice.\n\nGia raised her head, unharmed, and smiled. The cult gasped. \u201cOkay, I thought that was a rather stirring death performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you not dead?\u201d the young cultist asked with a quiver in her voice. \n\n\u201cYou picked the wrong kind of person for a sacrifice. Hashtag cult problems, am I right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot stand for this,\u201d the leader said. \u201cOur god will not be pleased with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean, Loki?\u201d Gia said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s getting a good chuckle right now.\u201d\n\nThe leader got in Gia\u2019s face. \u201cHow do you know of our god?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we go way back,\u201d Gia explained and then thought about the chronological order of time. \u201cOr forward technically. He casted me as the first leader of the Cult of Mischief centuries ago to fool some traveling act for him to study their reactions. I\u2019m surprised the cult is still around, to be honest, but knowing him and his partner, I bet they\u2019re watching, studying.\u201d\n\nThere was a hushed discussion amongst the members when two people revealed themselves from a stack of cargo containers. One was a slender man in a pink suit with bold, black outlines and a young woman in a red satin dress holding a transparent tablet device. Both had black hair and flowed in sync with each other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s them!\u201d one of the members shouted. \u201cFrom the painting of the first ritual.\u201d\n\nAll the cult members dropped to their knees.\n\n\u201cLoki, Raven, how are you two doing?\u201d Gia cheerfully greeted.\n\n\u201cI must admit, I find it humorous they tried to sacrifice you,\u201d Loki dryly said while adjusting his cufflinks as they approached Gia.\n\nRaven worked on freeing Gia. \u201cIt\u2019s been fascinating studying the cult\u2019s evolution throughout the centuries.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am growing bored of it,\u201d Loki confessed.\n\n\u201cShall we end?\u201d Raven asked him.\n\n\u201cYes, let\u2019s go out on top.\u201d Loki turned to address the cultists, who were still bowing down. \u201cSince you tried to kill my friend, I will now forsake you and no longer give you my blessings \u2013 ever. Begone!\u201d\n\nThe cultists scattered away as Raven undid the last strap around Gia.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Gia said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next for two?\u201d\n\nLoki and Raven exchanged glances and spoke in unison. \u201cMore mayhem.\u201d",

Waves of red swept into eddies of ochre oranges and sulfuric yellows. The longer you looked at it, the less any of the colors wanted to stand still. It might have shown a sunset, or the thin skin of a star. I ached to possess the skill the artist so clearly had possessed. The command of colors, of *emotions*.

Do you want it?\u201d\n\nShe gave a laugh that would fool most people. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty poor security if I did.\u201d Tension crept into her shoulders as I walked closer, arms outstretched to indicate the wider gallery around us. \u201cA thousand paintings, works worthy of Art\u2019s personal attention, and you don\u2019t want a single one?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d She was even more convincing this time. A hint of a raised eyebrow, arms crossed across her chest, but I could feel the lie underneath as sure as I could feel the body I currently wore. As sure as I could feel the raw need burning in her chest. I stopped a few paces from where she stood. We were of a height.\n\n\u201cBut you want something from them. Your working here is nothing but an excuse to orbit condensed works of emotion that can\u2019t be found anywhere else. You worship the scrape of a palette knife against canvas, the caress of a brush swirling in ink, and you wish every night when you leave that you might one day find that same passion yourself before you die.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\n\nConfusion tinged with a little bit of fear played freely across her face as I continued. \u201cYou work here so that when you paint those works that no one else is allowed to see in that room whose door you always keep closed, that some hint of the brilliance you stare at every day at your job will one night be staring back at you from your own easel.\u201d\n\nSilence in the gallery. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, her voice raw.\n\nI took a last step forward, close enough I could have placed a hand on her shoulder, and focused my presence on the flame at her core. A flame that in seconds grew to a blaze, and then an all-consuming conflagration.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had it wrong,\u201d I said, speaking so quietly she had to lean forward to hear. \u201cThe brilliance never appears in front of you. It pours out until you are staring at your own reflection.\u201d\n\nA long moment stretched into existence.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked.\n\nI backed up, unable to resist a grin. \u201cJust a reflection.\u201d\n\nEveryone\u2019s eyes bored into my back as I left. I basked in the sensation of my flame kindling in each of their chests.\n\n\u201cBro, what the *fuck*?\u201d one of the high schoolers said, but then I was gone. I made my way through the last of the gallery, past the over-priced gift shop. A quick stop to swipe a sandwich from the cafeteria to help sate the hunger that had been growing over the last day or so\u2014I was still getting used to how much food a male teenager eats, and then I was out into one of the courtyards bordering the museum. Museums, I was fully convinced, were modern man\u2019s single best idea other than social media. So many different ways to compare yourself to others; so many different ways to come up *wanting*.\n\nI turned onto an alley, munching on my sandwich and mentally mapping out the best way to get to the next gallery on my to-do list. It supposedly had a Chelsea from her monochromatic period, but I suspected it was a forgery. Which was even better, honestly, so long as it was done well. Good forgeries\u2014the really good ones, at least\u2014were only ever done by people who looked at a painting, and really, truly *needed* it.\n\nThe alley turned before I was expecting it to, dead-ending in a collection of rusted dumpsters and a single deflated car tire. Worn posters reminding people to travel in groups and report any cult-related activity to local police plastered the brick walls. I shoved the last bits of lunch into my mouth and put my hands on my hips. This wasn\u2019t right. It had been a couple hundred years since I\u2019d last been in this city, but how much could it have changed, really? I was still busy trying to figure out which way was north and why on earth cults would be a problem in an otherwise completely average city when a funny-smelling black hood slammed over my head and cinched tight.\n\nI turned around despite the fact that I couldn\u2019t see a thing. Cloves and other, harsher chemicals burned my nose. Vertigo was already sweeping through my head. I tugged at the hood, feeling waterproofed fabric before my hands were knocked away by a wooden rod. A baseball bat maybe. I clasped my shoulders with my hands to help prevent my fingers from breaking when I fell, and smiled. This was a pretty decent kidnapping. Someone had chops. I could no longer tell whether I was still standing. Dreams of others filled my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fznjqe/comment/iwjymxi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

            "comment": "Part 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cSon of a *bitch*, you are kidding me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you now come to understand?\u201d the man with a blank canvas asked.\n\n\u201cThe Order of the Broken Plate?\u201d I asked. I couldn\u2019t believe it. You guys are still *around*?\u201d\n\nSilence. Then, \u201cWhat?\u201d It was hard to tell who spoke, but I think it was the Hyungin off to my left. \u201cYah, you know, the Order of the Broken Plate. Cult dedicated to the God of Art. Your symbol of the broken plate is supposed to represent how any mundane object can through deliberate human action represent something else entirely and become art. Become Art, if your desire is strong enough.\u201d\n\nThe figures around me recoiled as if I\u2019d struck them physically. \u201c*What* have you been *telling* him?\u201d Another voice demanded. This one was feminine, and I had no trouble figuring out it was the Geratoni. Her arms were held in a \u2018what the hell?\u2019 posture.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t told him anything, I swear!\u201d the blank canvas said, hands held up by his ears. \u201cHe just woke up a few seconds ago, and then started ignoring me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how does he know Forbidden Knowledge of the fourth level?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea!\u201d\n\nOh, this was the worst. I would never live this down. This was bad. \u201cArt,\u201d I called up at the ceiling. \u201cArt! Get yourself down here and sort this out. Your stupid cult has gotten out of hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe silent,\u201d The Hyungin said, slashing her hand in a knife-like gesture aided by the long steel knife she now held.\n\n\u201cNo. Art! Haha, funny joke. I swear I will pee on every painting in this city if you don\u2019t get your sorry ass down here.\u201d\n\nCold hands pressed my head back down onto the table. \u201cIf you know our closest secrets, then you know your purpose. Be still, be silent, and revel in your donation to the power of Art.\u201d The knife raised above my torso.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not donating shit.\u201d\n\nThe knife paused. \u201cWill you tell us how you know of our Forbidden Knowledge?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know because I founded you guys as a fucking prank ages ago to punk Art. Have you all actually been sacrificing people to them this whole time? You know they hate that, right? Sacrificing people was never their thing. Sacrificing time, money, effort and all for sure, but people? Not so much.\u201d It clicked for me that this had probably been going on for a *while*. And that it would be entirely reasonable for Art to blame me. And that after several centuries of human sacrifice, their opinion would hold considerably more\u2026*weight*, than it once did. Shit. Several interactions I\u2019d had with them over the last decade were making a lot more sense all of a sudden.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d the Hyungin said. \u201cKeep your secrets.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Art must be so pissed.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fznjqe/comment/iwjywmg/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

            "comment": "Part 3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cOh, Art must be so pissed.\u201d\n\nThe knife descended like the hand of a vengeful\u2014maybe somewhat justified\u2014god. It made a dull punching noise as the blade slid into my chest like it was nothing more than an overripe cantaloupe. Pain flooded my mind, my breath rushing out in a coughing gasp. Several more stabs reduced my heart to a shredded lump of meat.\n\n\u201cHis life to you, Art!\u201d the cultists intoned. \u201cMay you prosper, and remember your humble servants!\u201d\n\nAs far as lines went, it wasn\u2019t bad, but it also wasn\u2019t anything worthy of the stage, either. I\u2019d never been all that good at actually *making* things, after all. Not my deal. The body I\u2019d had at that time had also been considerably drunk, if I was remembering correctly, so that hadn\u2019t helped either.\n\nI was still mulling things over when hands began working at the ties binding my limbs. The men and women all around me had taken off their masks, and looked more agitated than you\u2019d expect out of a group of folks who had just tried to commit ritualistic murder.\n\nThe lady who\u2019d worn the Hyungin mask yanked the wide belt off my middle. \u201cNow that\u2019s done,\u201d she said, \u201cwe need to figure out exactly how he knew our closest secrets. We either have a mole, or a tome has been stolen from the sanctum.\u201d\n\nA middle-aged man who looked like he could have been a banker waggled the knife at her. My blood coated the blade. \u201cWell, you just killed the best way of figuring that one out.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get smart with me. If the kid could fire back like he was doing, he was going to keep spinning shit. We weren\u2019t getting anything from him and you know it.\u201d\n\nI sat up.\n\nThis caused some excitement. I poked at my chest. \u201cUgh, come onnnnn, I *liked* this body.\u201d Blood leaked slowly out of the ruin that had been my chest. Two thuds sounded in the room as a couple cultists straight up fainted. I looked around. A few folks must have run out of the room. The remainder were plastered against the walls, staring at me with wide eyes. The lady with the knife held it out in front of her like that would do anything.\n\nAn androgynous figure stepped out of the wall to my right as smoothly as someone stepping though a doorway. Their body was made from the same rough stone as our surroundings, and gave a different impression every time you looked at them. First they appeared feminine, then masculine, then somehow both. Features that were Asian, then African, then Polynesian shifted into position, each in the space of a breath, but none appearing to actually change the figure itself. They were constantly in flux.\n\nThree more cultists dropped unconscious.\n\n\u201cOoo, you got three of them there. Nice job, Art.\u201d\n\n\u201cVy, it\u2019s good to see you again. Been a while.\u201d Their voice was smooth, with an accent I knew was pointless to try and track down. I\u2019d tried. Either it had never existed, or simply hadn\u2019t existed yet. The remaining humans in the room fell to their knees in supplication before their god.\n\n\u201cNot true!\u201d I said, holding up a blood-stained finger. \u201cWe both went to that bodybuilding competition last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there was that state fair the year before with that grandma and those pies.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive years ago.\u201d\n\nI slid over so my legs dangled off the alter. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that a friendship like ours can\u2019t be determined by quantity. It\u2019s the quality of interactions that counts. Which, I feel like I should point out, is currently *extremely lacking*!\u201d\n\nThe priestess on the floor was still holding the knife she\u2019d used to kill my current body. She subtly tried to hid the blade behind her without ever raising herself from her prostrated position.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Art said.\n\n\u201cIt was basically brand new! I\u2019d had it less than a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find a new one. You always do.\u201d\n\nI made a disgusted noise.\n\nArt picked up one of the discarded masks in their stone fingers and examined it briefly before tossing it back to the floor. \u201cNow, fairs fair. You created a cult of human sacrifice in my name, and I watched as you got sacrificed by that same cult. I\u2019d say we\u2019re even.\u201d\n\n\u201cI literally can\u2019t express how much I wish I had your ability to appreciate schadenfreude in this moment.\u201d\n\nArt laughed.\n\nI kicked my feet back and forth. \u201cSo, is there really a Chelsea in the gallery across town?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a forgery.\u201d\n\nI punched a slightly floppy hand towards the ceiling. \u201cYes! I was *hoping* it was a forgery. Wanna go?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lacking a functional body at the moment, Envy.\u201d\n\nI was definitely swaying a little, and I couldn\u2019t feel my feet. Human bodies can only be pushed so far. I let it fall back to the flat stone as my presence expanded to fill the room. The remaining cultists collectively gasped, their eyes drawn like lodestones to the works of Art displayed around the room on their discarded masks. Raw emotion burned in their eyes as they stared at the pinnacles of human achievement, and felt me in their veins. They could not help but stare and envy what they saw.\n\n&lt;None of these ones here really *feel* me on their own, yah know?&gt;\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to pick one up on the way. There are enough people in the city that a host will likely present itself if we take a more scenic route.\u201d\n\nI mused on that for a second. Art was probably right. And there was a Chelsea to see. &lt;Well, then, what are we waiting for. Let\u2019s go!&gt;",

            "comment": "This was unforseen.\n\nTwo tall, slim men carried Aphrodite by her arms to a pair of large, wooden doors. The men were both very exotic in both mannerisms and looks, and she hated to say that if this were another situation, she wouldn't be afraid to try and seduce one, or both of them. However, one had a slighter build than the other. The doors creaked open, and a delightful smell filled her nostrils. Nothing she could understand, but amazing none the less. She did not resist their earlier attempts at capturing her, and came in a rather quiet fashion, since she knew whatever was going to happen was not as serious as it was from the mortal point of view. The room was filled with scantily dressed women, and they looked of the same nationality as the two men, who were now thrusting her into the room. There were no seats in the room, but velvety sitting pillows and a large, glossy wooden table near the largest window. As Aphrodite fell onto the carpeted ground, the smaller of the two men spoke in a legato language of beautifully articulated words, and then gestured towards her as he did so. A woman wearing a bralette and pants of the same dreamy eggplant tone, with rich, chocolate brown eyes, spoke back to the smaller of the two men in the same language, and then looked at Aphrodite. \"You are an ungodly temptress, who shall not sin any longer. Lay before our god in all your shame to be truly saved.\" Aphrodite looked up at the woman, and saw the words \"His light is our grace.\" tattooed onto her wrist.\n\nOh no.\n\nThis was not what she expected to be doing on a Tuesday afternoon, being captured and sacrificed by the cult she created for Apollo for being a jerk to her, but she couldn't back out now. There was no way she could lie her way out of this. Even if she told the truth, she wouldn't be believed. The woman in eggplant grabbed a similar woman in a bralette and pants of the same style, but in a rose tone. She yelled towards the group, now excluding the lady in the rose tone, something in the same previous language and then gestured towards the door. They all left except Aphrodite, and the woman in the rose tone. The woman in eggplant peeked her head in through the door and said \"Now get her ready for the ceremony.\" Then left without any remark directed towards Aphrodite.\n\nThe girl in rose averted her gaze and remarked \"I'm Valentina Sol.\" Valentina, a pretty name. \"Could you be a doll and tell me what's going on here?\" Asked Aphrodite cautiously. \"Oh, those meatheads didn't tell you? Oh, how useful they are.\" Remarked Valentina with a less than subtle eye-roll. \"Listen, we're here to sacrfice you to the greek god of light, Apollo. This religious group was formed over a hundred years ago, and I'm yet to understand why we're doing this.\" Aphrodite felt her face flush red, and brushed off the comment with a slight sigh. \"So what is this ceremony, exactly?\" \"Well, I've been told that you've been a \"temptress\" and had men go against their own better judgement to have sex with them.\" Said Valentina, unphased. \"So the ceremony itself actually has you laying before Apollo's light on the table.\" \"That's it?\" \"While we slice you for every sin you've comitted against Him.\" There's the kicker.\n\nWell, that's the thing, do you worship Apollo, as we do?\" \"No, I do not.\" \"I believe you shouldn't have to sacrifice yourself if you aren't willing to be cleansed. I'd sooner sacrifice myself than let anyone have it against their own will.\" Remarked Valentina in a strong, clear tone. \"Well, what do you think about getting out of here? You obviously don't like it here, and it's not the best place for me at the moment.\" I worship Him with all my being, and therefore have a duty to serve him for the rest of my life. I shan't let a temptress as yourself walk the Earth in your current state.\" Damn it, she needed to get out, and fast.\n\n\"Well, may I be sacrificed in a sinners wear?\" \"I assume some adjustments can be made.\" She took a jewl adorned belt from her bag and set it onto her hips snugly. Suddenly, Valentina's expression grew soft. \"Darling, what's wrong?\" Said Aphrodite, even though she knew exactly what was happening. \"I'm not sure, but I must say, your beauty is unparaleled by that of any being on this planet, if I could be of any service to you, please let me know!\" Bingo, she's done it again. \"Well, Miss Valentina, I was wondering if you could, by any chance, help me get out of this room and back into the real world?\" \"Anything for you, my mistress of beauty.\"\n\nAphrodite and Valentina got off the pillows, and Valentina led her to a small door in the back of the room. \"Shall we, Miss?\" Said Valentina in a dreamy tone. \"We certainly shall.\" Valentina crouched down to the door and unlocked it, opening it for her. \"Please, you first.\" Aphrodite quickly took the invitation, and crawled through the door, and was met with soft, warm sunlight hitting her face, and plush feeling grass on her knees. As she stood, she saw Valentina making her way out as well. \"Mistress, I must know your name before you leave!\" Remarked Valentina passionately. She hesitated, \"Will she let me leave if I tell her? Best to become distant before I do.\" Thought Aphrodite cautiously. \"That's for me to know, and for you to wonder, my little pet.\" Said Aphrodite as she walked towards the street shops.\n\nWell, better not do that again.\n\n(Btw I'm new to this sub so any constructive critisism is welcome!)",

Also, when writing dialogue between different characters it\u2019s better to use separate sentences or short paragraphs for each person as they speak; it\u2019s a lot more effective as each interaction stands out as well as providing room for added details on how each individual speaks. \n\nHope this helps :)",

            "comment": "black.\nthat was what i saw last before i fell unconscious after being striked in the head by the cult leader. \nthey have tried to kill me 4 times, each in different methods. they won't give up. \n\nas far as i know the cult is worshipping charles. haven't seen him in a while.\ngoddammit, i should've known that the result of manipulating the Richard family into thinking charles was immortal and a divine being 6 years would bit me in the ass. all i meant was to do an harmless prank. \n\n8 people have gone missing last week. i reckon the cult has something to do with it. \n\ni should really find a way to get back home. i know where i am but i can't find my keys. \noh fuck, i hear footsteps. crap, crap there's no where to go.\n[door opens] [tall, pale man wearing a dress, with a cane in his hand walks in]\n\"i see you're already awake. i'm not surprised considering you survived the last 3 times.\" said the cult leader.\nhe examines me and then puts his hand on my shoulder. \"unfortunately, you're the only sacrifice The Almighty is expecting.\" says the cult leader.\nhe hits my head with his cane and i feel dizzy.\ni should've known to kill charles back then.\n\nto be continued.......\n\nThis is my first attempt. Please go easy on me lmao. Any constructive criticism is appreciated. Also I'm looking for a person who can teach me the in and out of writing as i aspire to become one. Thank you.",

            "comment": "\nAs she lay on the cold, moss covered stone, bound to it with relatively thin rope, the men and women chanted, over and over, \u201cOur god, hear us, take this wretch as our gift to you\u201d she recognized the language as Nahuatl, an Aztec language. She understood almost all languages, she was after all over 3,000 years old and had spoken them in her time on this planet. \n\u201cUmmm, excuse me, what exactly is it you think you\u2019re going to accomplish?\u201d She asked impatiently, the combination of moss and her hair was starting to itch on her back and she was beginning to get annoyed.\n\u201cEvery 52 years we must offer a sacrifice to Huitzilopochtli to make him strong and prevent the end of the world for another 52 years.\u201d\n\u201cOh you\u2019ve got to be shitting me,\u201d she whispered. She knew what was going on, she was X\u014dchiquetzal, goddess of fertility, beauty and the sexual power of females, and she had been captured by humans to be sacrificed, to Huitzilopochtli, one of her ex lovers. \nAfter Huitzilopochtli had broken off their frequent trysts, she had started the rumor that, if the Mexicas didn\u2019t sacrifice a woman every 52 years the world would end. This would piss off Huitzilopochtli because, even though he loved his sacrifices, he also hated it when women were sacrificed. \n\u201cI started this shit more than 2,000 years ago\u201d she thought, \u201chow the fuck did they keep it up this long?!\u201d\nX\u014dchiquetzal knew she couldn\u2019t be killed, so she wasn\u2019t worried about that, she just didn\u2019t want the inconvenience of having to deal with the freak out the humans would have when she didn\u2019t die. \nShe could either let them \u201ckill her\u201d and deal with the aftermath, or she could call Huitzilopochtli and ask him to get her out of this mess. But, that would mean she had to explain to him what she did. \n\u201cFuck this,\u201d she said aloud, as she did her skin began to glow a warm and radiant orange and her eyes flashed a deep ocean blue. The wind began to swirl around her and her stone bed.\n\u201cYou will not feed your god with my blood today,\u201d her voice echoed through the night, getting deeper with each word. She moved her arms as though to clap her hands, but instead she snapped the ropes as though they were strands of hair. As she rose off the stone and into the air, the wind whirled around her, glowing skin, hair being whipped around by the wind. She hung in the air, almost as if she were standing on a platform, though the Mexicas could see there was none, she was the brightest object in the sky. And in those last moments, she spoke to them with a voice that sounded as though it came from the sky instead of her lips, \u201cNow you\u2019ll see what happens when you really piss off a god.\u201d",

They didn\u2019t know my little secret.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d asked one of the members\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know I\u2019m immortal.\u201d\n\nThen, the others started laughing and pulled their cloaks off as their god revealed himself to be a close friend of mine.\n\n\u201cChelsea!\u201d he exclaimed\n\n\u201cRyan!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you set this prank up centuries ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too. It\u2019s hard to have a little fun these days.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ccult members\u201d left and Ryan and I talked about our lives and how being immortal sucks.\n\n\u201cWhy do you hate being immortal?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are all these great generations and grow up with them, just to watch them die.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not immortal.\u201d\n\nI was glad he wasn\u2019t immortal too, but part of me wanted an immortal friend. He had died when he was young, and very sick. I wished he had more of a life, but I wasn\u2019t able to stop his death. We had agreed to become immortal best friends, since he was dead and couldn\u2019t die again. It was nice to have some company for a change.",

            "comment": "It was a Monday. Hades hated Mondays, and this particular Monday was faring no better than any had before. He had woken up chained to an altar with a throbbing headache, surrounded by cultists wearing the most abhorrent shapeless pink and green robes. As he slowly came to his senses, he found with some alarm that he had very little recollection of the night before. In his defence, he had been incredibly drunk at the time. Ebony flames singed his hair and the screams of the damned echoed around him. Those were not a problem. To Hades, that was just another Tuesday. The dagger that damnable mortal was holding above his chest, on the other hand? That was a very big problem.  Hades was immortal, but that did not mean he was unable to feel pain, and from the gleam the dagger's wicked edge gave off, this was going to be very, very painful. Hades disliked pain. He found the whole murder affair incredibly unpleasant, which some might say was a hindrance in his field of work, but Hades had never held a fondness for such fools. He ruled over the dead and the underworld, yes, but murder? That was for Thanatos. \n\n\"Could I have my phone call?\" He inquired politely to the strangely dressed cultist holding the dagger.  \"Cease your yammering, buffoon!\" Now that was just rude. \"Your blood shall usher in the new spring in the name of the great goddess Persephone!\" Hades stared at the man, gobsmacked, and began to laugh. The man looked at him in stunned silence. \"Persephone is my wife!\" \"Lies!\" Shouted an angry voice from the crowd. \"Kill the heathen!\" Screamed another. This was all getting rather tiring, Hades thought. It was time to end this charade. Magic cracked at his fingertips as he snapped the chains binding him to the platform. It was at that moment that the cultist decided to stab him.  Hades screamed, curses flowing from his mouth like the godly ichor leaking from his chest. His mortal form finally collapsed, bathing the cultists in a radiant light that left nothing but dust. \"I hate Mondays,' he muttered, before promptly passing out.\n\nAfter later hearing the whole story of what had happened the previous night from Zeus and Poseidon, Hades made the rather wise decision to never again engage in a night of reckless debauchery with either of his brothers.",

Yowzah those cultists who worship me are sacrificing my good friend who looks like a guy but is really a god!\" \n\n\"My bruddahs dis guy does not know de wai we must show him de wai\" said the cultists who sounded suspiciously similar to a certain meme ;). \n\n\"Wait just a minute you're the cultists I pranked I remember now.

Hahahahah xD you guys actually feel for that prank xD.\" \n\n\"Hahahaha this guy is too funny he was just pranking me! What a mad lad!\" Said the god who was friends with the god.\n\n\"Schrong forg FRAKKAH\" said the priest as he plunged his unholy knife now covered in cow excrement deep into the man's body. With spastic movements the priest stabbed the man over and over creating coating the alter in blood and shit. Finally the priests energy had been exhausted and he plunged his knife into the man one more time before stepping back, gasping and covered in mess of his unholy deed. \n\n\"Bruh.\" Said the guy who got stabbed buy it's okay cause he's a god. \"I'm gonna go home now. And by the way my friend who's a god like me, get pranked bro B)\" he said epicly. \n\nThe end",

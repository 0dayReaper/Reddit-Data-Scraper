            "comment": "\"Come!\" The paw on the back of my head scratches through my fur. I snap at Dodger. He still treats me like a pup, and he is old. Old or not, he manages to catch me and roll me over. I bat at his chest and he snaps and growls near my ears until I surrender.\n\n\"Insolent pup,\" he growls again as he lets me up.\n\n\"I'm not a pup!\" I stand up and shake. \"I have earned my name. The Lady gave me a name!\"\n\n\"Dodger! Sapphire!\" The girl's voice from inside makes me perk up my ears. \n\n\"The Lady calls again. Come!\" He turns back toward the house and trots over. I follow, and playfully snap at his golden tail. He ignores me because I am obeying.\n\nThe Lady opens the door. The youngest. Not quite 100 years yet. She just came of age last week, and there was a big celebration. I was quite popular that night, as her friends gave me many treats. There was talk among the adults about her going away. She said I would go with her, and that made me happy. I wag my tail at her. The Lady pats my head, but then she kneels down and hugs Dodger. The Lady is crying.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" I ask her. She only reaches out and pats my head again. She doesn't understand me yet. Not like the Master. The Master knows what we say. He understands Dodger more easily. And then I notice that Dodger is not wagging his tail. He is also sad.\n\n\"Dodger?\" I demand. I muscle my way into the hug and lick the Lady's face. She laughs a little. \"Dodger, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"I have to go see the Master,\" he says. He breaks away from the hug and leaves me with the Lady, who hugs me now instead. I sniff her. She smells of the chemicals that Master smells like all the time now. I listen. I can hear the Mistress talking, talking to the Peddler of the chemicals. I nudge out of the hug to follow Dodger, up the stairs, up to Master's room.\n\n\"Hey Sapphire,\" says the Mistress when I enter. She rubs me behind the ears the way I like. I tell her thank you.\n\n\"Beautiful Husky,\" says the Peddler. I greet him and he pets me. He seems all right, but for the odd smell.\n\n\"She belongs to my granddaughter.\" The Mistress's voice sounds odd, like she is in distress, but I smell no danger.\n\n\"Ah.\" The Peddler is packing up. \"If you need anything else...\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" The Mistress walks out with him.\n\nDodger is on the bed. He lays his head on Master's chest, who looks asleep. The chemicals make me want to sneeze, but Dodger had told me that is disrespectful. There's another smell too: it's been present for a long time, but today it is stronger than before.\n\nI walk up to the side of the bed. \"Dodger!\" I speak loudly to get his attention.\n\nHe opens his big brown eyes. \"Quiet, pup,\" he says. \"And go away.\"\n\n\"No! Tell me what is going on. Why does the Master smell like this? Why is my Lady crying?\" I put my paws on the bed to look at Master. His skin is very sallow and thin. The veins stand out.\n\n\"I am the Seventh,\" says Dodger. He lifts his head from Master's chest. \"My family was made part of the Master's family generations ago, when he was just a pup.\" Dodger looks at his Master's face. \"The First was named Dodger as well. He named me, knowing I would be the last.\"\n\n\"The last?\" I whine. \"Dodger, what are you talking about?\"\n\nDodger sighs. \"You're too young to understand.\"\n\n\"I am not a puppy!\" I say it loudly. \"I am not!\"\n\nThe Master opens his eyes, and I wonder if I have made a mistake. But he laughs and reaches out to scratch my ears. Like the Mistress, he knows how to scratch properly.\n\n\"Hullo, Sapphire,\" he says. I wag my tail. \"Be a good dog for Jenny, mm?\"\n\n\"I will,\" I tell him. I feel Dodger looking at me, all solemn.\n\n\"Good girl,\" says Master. \"I don't have long before I go. Dodger will take care of me.\"\n\nI hear a car pull up the driveway outside. It's a large one. I run to the window and look out: it's big and white, and strange humans in uniform get out. The Mistress begins to talk with them. I run back to the bed.\n\nI look at Dodger. \"He can't leave. You can't leave!\" I whine.\n\n\"Hey, hey,\" says Master. He catches me near the ears again, gently. \"I told you, Dodger will take care of me.\"\n\nI whine at them both. \"You can't leave!\"\n\nThe men come upstairs with a bed on wheels. The Lady comes with them and takes me aside.\n\n\"Gotta move the dog.\"\n\n\"I'll move him,\" says the Mistress. She lifts Dodger off the bed. He seems older than he did a little while ago. I whine at the Lady, but she just holds me and cries.\n\n\"He can't leave!\" I tell her, but she doesn't understand yet. \"They won't bring him back!\"\n\nBut he does leave. The Lady just holds me and weeps while the vehicles drive away.\n\nWe go downstairs and outside. Dodger walks down the driveway, following the vehicles.\n\n\"Dodger, wait!\" I strain against the Lady's hands. She calls for Dodger, and he waits a moment. I get free.\n\n\"Dodger, we have to bring the Master back!\" I tell him. I could still hear the vehicles on the road. The Lady was running up behind me.\n\nHe wags his tail at me. \"He told you to be a good dog and take care of the Lady. Be good, Sapphire.\" He licks my face and runs off, golden fur shining in the sunlight. Lady holds onto me and calls for Dodger, but he disobeys. I had never seen him disobey before. He had never called me by my name before.\n\nI only saw Dodger one more time: we found him at the meadow where the Master's body was laid, curled against the crossed stone that marked it.\n\nHe was the Seventh of his family. I am the First of mine.\n\n---\n\n*Wow, I'm overwhelmed by all the feedback and the comments. I'm so glad so many people enjoyed this!*",

When i arrived first time there, I was very worried to get out of my bike, but I thought that it's much more likely that the dog will stay quiet, since it's a very gas station and it wouldn't make any sense for the dog to get upset every time a vehicle comes in. I got off my bike to get gas and whatever, the dog didn't even look at me. It got up, walked slowly to the side of the building, looked around, returned to its spot and laid down again. \n\ncontrast that to the \"common dog\" i see around, fighting against its owner's leash, on its two hind legs, tongue flapping about, barking, yelping, saliva flying everywhere, inching trying to sniff/bite/lick me or whatever. I ask the owner \"please, keep your pet close to you, I need to get off my bike and it's in my way\". They respond \"oh, don't worry, it doesn't bite\". Why, thank you for giving me such important information. The equivalent of \"please sir, could you move two feet to the right, i need to get inside\", \"oh, don't worry, I don't punch\". Brilliant.",

Even when he went blind and mostly deaf from old age, he still made his nightly rounds of the house to make sure everything was okay. He ate at the same time we did, he slept when we did, and he was always happy to see you. Only ever barked when the doorbell rang, but that was a greeting bark. Sadly, over time, that bark faded away, and the rush to the door became slower.\n\nOne night the smoke detector went off, and even in his advanced age and blindness, he still ran through the house, upstairs, and jumped onto my bed. He growled and snapped at Mom and Dad when they tried to get him off, but he wouldn't move until I got up. Mom swears this is because he was protecting me, since he didn't do this for my brother (who in fairness had probably already gotten up, I don't remember). He *knew* that I'm hard of hearing and he wanted to make sure his little brother was safe.\n\nI think I'm going to go to bed and cry now.",

                            "comment": "This hits me in the feels a little... a few months ago we were looking at puppies and a breeder we met had a cute little mini australian shepherd. She said no one wanted her because she is deaf, and she was worried she would have to terminate her. I usually have incredible difficulty connecting to people and animals but this little puppy stole my heart the moment I picked her up. Came back to get her the next day (I needed time to buy all the supplies!).\n\nOver the past few months, I've been learning some basic signs and figuring out how to communicate with my dog. She learns *really* fast! But I've had to learn too, like how you can't see small hand gestures when you're far away and other things you never really think of until you have to. It has been quite a learning experience, and now we communicate so well a lot of people never notice she is deaf.\n\nI don't know what I am going to do with myself if this puppy ever gets sick or hurt. Just the thought of it is making me tear up. [This is my dog.](http://imgur.com/a/19dnE) Making the album made me feel a little better. At least I have lots of photos of her! My wife goes a bit crazy with the camera...\n\nOther fun stuff:  \n* My wife talks with her hands a lot. This confuses and frustrates Maya.  \n* She often pretends she doesn't understand what I'm saying or looks away so she can't see my hands.  \n* She always rests/sleeps touching us somehow. Presumably so she knows if we move around.  \n* She has not figured out how I know she's doing bad things even when I can't see her. I wonder if she will ever realize that I can sense her in a way she can't.  \n* Her vocalizations often don't quite sound right, much like the way deaf people speaking often sounds different. And sometimes her sounds are unlike anything I've ever heard. I will admit I am not above laughing at my dog for this, because sometimes it's just too odd to ignore. Honestly, it adds to the charm.  \n\nHopefully we get to enjoy each other's company for many years.",

We've been back and forth with the breeder about various things like MDR1 (which the parents do not have) and it has been quite a learning experience. From what I've read of the research, it seems the pink/white ears and deafness are often linked in some breeds, mini aussies included. It's interesting that the colors that make her look so unique and pretty are also linked to her disability.",

Or at least as happy as possible following the prompt.*\n\nI never knew master's wife.  Father said that she was kind and generous and fed him scraps from the table when master wasn't looking.  Master did the same, too, of course.  That's what humans did.\n\nMaster was a god, father told me when I was younger.  He cared for us, he protected us, he taught us and he played with us.  In return we offered our service, paltry as it was.  Always faithful to our master.  How could we not be?  Those were long years ago, now.  Father had since passed, and I had children of my own.  The master's children kept them, they visited often in their grand chariots.  It was good days when they came to visit.\n\nI was old now.  My time would be up soon, I knew it.  I didn't mind.  I had fathered many children, gone on many walks, sniffed many butts.  I would rest soon.  Which was good, because I was tired.  Sometimes I forgot I was tired, usually when I was with master, and I would play like I was a puppy again.  Then I would be very tired.\n\nI thought about my life as I lay on my back, comfortable.  I heard the door open, the familiar footsteps of master.  I waited for a moment.  \"Dag nabbit Tex I told you don't get on the couch!\"  He muttered, tossing his hat onto the rack.  \"Well, if you're not getting off at least make some room.\"\n\nFather said that humans lived eons, that master had been his master, and his father's before him, and his father's before him, more generations than father could remember.  I was glad, master was a good master, he was kind.  He sat beside me, I put my head on his lap and looked up at him.  In return he scratched me behind my ears.  I felt my eyes close.  Certainly master was magic, nothing else felt like that.  Ohh....\n\n\"Come on, Tex.  We've gotta go to the store.  Wanna ride in the car?\"\n\nI scrambled to my feet, barking.  Yes!  A ride in the chariot!  What a treat.  Master secured my leash to my collar, struggling with it a little.  We got in the chariot and it made a noise like a lion's roar.  I barked in response, I would teach it to threaten master.  Stupid Chariot.\n\nAs master drove he kept one hand on the back of my head.  He was nice, I panted happily, letting the world pass me by, until he stopped scratching me.  I was puzzled.  Master lifted his hand to his chest, the other on the reigns of the chariot.  Something was wrong.  Something was very wrong.  Master winced in pain, I barked an alarm.\n\nI looked for something, anything to help, but the car was moving too fast and we weren't even on the road anymore, there was a tree ahead and it was big and heavy and I was scared and I kept barking.\n\nThen it was over.  How had we gotten here?  It was nice, a green field, trees, balls and ropes and rawhide bones and the couch was here too!  Wow, what was this place?  It's awesome!\n\nThere were other dogs, too.  Dogs I knew.  Friends!  I ran over, barking my excitement.  It was father!  But he was so young!  Barely more than a pup.  Mother too!  And grandfather, who I had smelled once before I opened my eyes.  I was so happy, my tail wagged and wagged, and I barked and barked.\n\nThere was a sudden stillness.  I looked.  Master was here, but it wasn't master.  He was young, as young as his children, but he was the same master I knew.  He smiled at me, and at all of us, and we ran to him, bowled him over in our eagerness and he just laughed and laughed, hugging us to him.  \"Tex!  Ralph!  Wolfie, Scott, Amy!  Oh, it's good to see you all again!\"  He shouted, we barked back.\n\nMaster stood, brushing himself off.  His eyes were far away, I followed his gaze.  It was a woman.  Father ran to her, I followed, and master came too.  She spoke, a kind voice, \"we've been waiting.\"\n\nHe laughed and she laughed and I barked and I ran and played with master and his wife and father.  We played all day, and for days and days and days, like I did when I was a puppy.  But now I wasn't tired, and nothing hurt, and master was happy.  I don't know how we got to this wonderful place, but I knew where I was.\n\nHome.",

            "comment": "The Master lifted his cane off of his throne in the room of gathering, leaned on it. He moved carefully, slowly to the glowing box in one corner of the room. He pressed a thin finger against the side of the box, and the glowing disappeared.\n\nI stood up to greet him as he turned to me. I looked up at his eyes. They were losing their color. Most Masters think dogs don't notice things, but I do. I have been a good dog to my Master, and I have noticed many things. \n\nI noticed when he was not moving in his bed one morning. I noticed when another Master was going to attack mine from behind. I noticed when my Master brought home a new, tiny Master with no motor skills and a high-pitched squeal.\n\n\"George, ya ole mutt,\" my Master chuckled, reaching down to scratch my neck. I loved it when he scratched my neck!\n\nAs he pulled his hand back, I looked back into his eyes and tilted my head.\n\nMy Master sat back down in his soft throne, leaned forward. \"I know, boy-o,\" he whispered, lifting my head with his hand, holding his cane in his other, \"I'm not looking so good. I'm not moving as fast as I used to, I can't do all of the things I used to do with you.\"\n\nMoisture began to form around his eyes. I have seen this before, he is sad. My Master is sad, but why? Is it because he is getting old? Is it because of me? Did I do something wrong? I nudged my nose closer to him, making him chuckle.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" my Master smiled, \"you're good, ole boy, you're good.\"\n\nOkay, good, it wasn't me.\n\n\"I do want to talk to you, though.\" My Master stood up briefly then dropped to one knee, laying his cane on the ground. \"Sit for me, Georgie. I'm going to be going to the hospital soon. I hope this is just for some tests, but I'm not sure.\"\n\nI tilted my head again. What is a \"hospital\"? Is it like Hell? Or, in other words, the Vet?\n\n\"This is looking like my last trip to the hospital, boy-o.\"\n\nSomething about his tone did not sound right to me. Moisture was appearing in his eyes again. Why is my Master so sad now? What is going on? I scooted a little closer to him, licking his hand. Maybe licking his hand would make him feel better.\n\n\"Thank you, boy,\" my Master said, stroking my head. \"You've been a good boy so far. We've had some pretty fun times, too. Remember those muggers?\" He laughed a big laugh this time. \"What a time! Good thing I had this with me.\" He picked up his cane, waved it at me. My tail wagged.\n\n\"I want you to know, boy-o, that I love you and that you have been the best friend anyone could have.\"\n\nI have no idea what he just said, but he looked intensely into my eyes, and the moisture was gone, so I think he was happy. My tail continued to wag. I licked his hand again.\n\nMy Master pressed his head to mine. We remained there for a good long while.\n\nMy tail continued to wag.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nI know this is done to death, but I do have to say... THANK YOU, KIND AND BEAUTIFUL STRANGER, FOR MY FIRST GILDING. You popped my Reddit cherry. I feel like I should give you a hug or something. Is that weird? And thank you for all of your comments, this really means a lot to me! And I appreciate the critiques as well - I'm constantly trying to better my writing, and commenting on /r/WritingPrompts and getting my stuff in front of you all has definitely helped! Have yourselves a wonderful Thanksgiving!\n\nAnd love on your pets a little more this week, too! ;P",

My first dog (I now own 2 instead of the 3 I remember leaving college with :( ) died while I was in my first semester of college, Oct 30. I didn't find out until this Friday on my way home. I don't have any pictures of him from recent times, and the way he died was alone in the basement because my parents couldn't stand the way he looked because he had no energy. They did what they could with medication and making his existing as painless as possible, but he passed the day they went to visit me. I feel so bad, and I'm tearing up just typing this. My old dog died alone, in the basement, without anybody near him. I feel terrible. He lived 17 long years, not all of them good. I could have been such a good owner in hindsight, I regret so much.",

I can understand things like *food* and *walk.* I cannot understand the heavy shove of these words, the wet ocean smell on her skin. \n\nWe went to the beach once, Mistress and the Cat Guardian. We stood beside the waves and judged the horizon. Mistress threw sticks into the surf and the Cat Guardian shied away from my wet paws. \n\nCat Guardian has two little demons that follow her. When we visit her, on long mornings, the cats slink through the rooms and tell me stories. They tell me about the way mice taste, how I am a stunted wolf, how they are tigers still in their tiny souls. \n\nBut today the demons are not with Cat Guardian. There is only her Bag of Secrets, a heavy heart, and a drawn look. \n\nCat Guardian brings me into the Room, where I have slept my whole life. There on the white bed, with the flowers and old stuffed animals I cannot chew. There Cat Guardian places me beside Mistress and lets her touch my throat, my nose, my ears. \n\nI understand her words, for they are slow and familiar. \"Be good.\" \n\nThen Cat Guardian is kneeling beside Mistress. She is touching her face, her hands, her hair. She is saying things too quickly for me to understand. She is weeping openly, her hands rattling. Cat Guardian is younger, within her first cycle of celestial ability. She will live four hundred more years. \n\nBut not Mistress. I know then what Cat Guardian is saying. She is picking up the leash, she is whispering \"walkies.\" She is looking away from Mistress. \n\n\"Be good, Blossom,\" Mistress says. \"I love you.\" \n\nThen Mistress turns away, to look at the windows. I am passed to another Being and taken from the white rooms, the white bed, the wonderful smell of flowers and cheese. I am taken into a car that smells like sand, to a world with demon tigers.\n\nAnd no Mistress. \n\nI do not see her again until she is stone growing from the ground.\n\nIt is their way.\n\n",

In between,  she was a constant companion,  who loved running along side during a bike ride as much as she like curling up and watching a movie. She'd chase after us sledding and steal our hats, and bring them back in the spring. She'd shake your hand, jump on command,  and \"forget \" all her training as soon as she was off leash. I'll always love her. She died in my arms, after getting hit by a car. I'm grateful it was swift and mostly painless for her.",

            "comment": "\u201cC\u2019mere, Miss.\u201d\n\nMy tail wags reflexively, but I don\u2019t move. I lay with my head in my human\u2019s lap, her long-toed paw curled like a bird foot in the warm spot under my ear. My human\u2019s pup\u2019s pup pats me on the side, and I shift a little so she can get to my belly. I wag my tail once, twice, in great lazy thumps.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d she repeats, baring her teeth and then reaching to tug at my collar. I whine, and she stops. Her teeth disappear. She makes more sounds, but I don\u2019t listen; she\u2019s not going to say anything I understand, anyway, other than my name and \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMy human\u2019s paw tightens and she coughs, loudly, with the rasp of fresh-clipped nails on hard gray ground. I whine again and nose her side. I wag my tail for her, but she doesn\u2019t seem to see. Her eyes have taken the milky white my mother\u2019s eyes did before she was taken away. Her short fur, what little she has, is almost colorless.\n\nPup-pup sighs and she stands up on legs I remember my mom saying she used to knock out from under her when she was actually puppy size. She isn\u2019t anymore, and hasn\u2019t been for as long as I\u2019ve been alive. \n\nI nudge my human again, and Pup-pup reaches to take my collar.\n\nI whine and I twist, but she says \u201cNo,\u201d and hauls me off the bed. I shake her off and jump back up and throw myself across my human. Pup-pup shouts \u201cNo!\u201d with panic and I flatten against my human.\n\nShe coughs again and I lick her chin.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, girl. Don\u2019t-\u201d Pup-pup starts, and I look at her. Her voice has changed. It was brittle before, but it\u2019s hitched the way humans\u2019 voices do before their eyes leak. My humans, because Pup-pup is mine, too, even if this human under my paws is most my human, have always buried their short muzzles into my shoulder when the eye-leaks start. \n\n\u201cMissy,\u201d she says again. I look between her and my human; her breathing has gotten worse. \u201cMissy, come,\u201d Pup-pup says and when she pulls on my collar, I move to the floor\u2014away from my human. I whine and press my chest against the side of the bed, but I can\u2019t reach her.\n\nPup-pup takes my place beside her. There\u2019s room enough for us both, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019d appreciate it. Instead, I place my chin on the blanket and watch.\n\nPup-pup takes hold of my human\u2019s bird-like paw and holds it between her young ones. She inhales sharply, and on the exhales says, \u201cI love you. I\u2019ll Miss you-\u201d\n\nMy human exhales.\n\nMy human\u2019s pup walks in with her mate. In his paw is my leash. I ignore him when he hooks it to my collar and tugs once, lightly. I grunt, and he tugs again. I whine and snap at him. He drops my leash and I jump up on the bed again, moving to my human\u2019s other side and snuggling up tight against her. I place my chin on her stomach and prick my ears.\n\nPup-pup\u2019s mother places her paw on her mate when he reaches for my leash. Instead, he sits beside Pup-pup, and Pup sits on my side of the bed.\n\nI turn my head to look up at my human. I lick her chin lightly. Her eyes are closed, and I can hear just how weakly her heart is beating. \n\nMy human\u2019s pup puts her paw on my back. I glance at her, but she doesn\u2019t make me leave. I give her a small tail wag, and her lips move, but don\u2019t part. Her cheeks are shiny.\n\nThis pup drove the car that took my mom away, when she was gray in the muzzle the way my human is now. Dogs aren\u2019t eternal, but humans are. Or something close to that\u2014like stars, they\u2019d always been and always would be. My human had been her human, had been her father\u2019s human, and so on.\n\nPup had used the great air-sucker, the loud one I learned to bark at because my mother barked at it, too, to take away the fur that had clung to the soft insides. And though she\u2019d thrown away the blanket my mother had slept on, I still smell her on the wind sometimes.\n\nI inhale as my human does, and exhale the same.\n\nWhen her chest doesn\u2019t rise again, mine does. And keeps rising, and falling, as does Pup\u2019s, her mate\u2019s, and Pup-pup\u2019s. Their eyes leak with salt-sweet tears, and I tuck my nose beneath her arm, expecting her to startle because that\u2019s what she should do.\n\nShe stays still, and so do I, even when the other humans walk out, brushing their paws against my fur. I hear \u201cI love you\u201d and I hear tears. But I hear no heartbeat, even when I press my ear to her chest and listen until men in white clothes come to take her and her blankets away in a big gray car.",

And her mum. And all the other dogs here. My person is a Good Boy too. He looks after us all. Small-Three-Leg, Old-One-eye, Soft-Fur, and me. They call me Loud-Bark. But our person calls us all different names. He calls me Max. I like that name the best.\n\nI don't know my person's name. Their language is a secret. I only know a few words. My favourites are ''walkies'', ''ball'' and ''dinner''. But my *most favourite* is ''Good Boy''.\n\nI'm a Good Boy.\n\n\nMy person isn't here right now and I'm worried. Last night other people came and took him away. They were angry people, pointing their loud sticks and shouting. Normally people are the best. I don't like those people. Old-One-Eye growled at them but my person told us to ''stay''. So we did. We watched him go. Now the sun's up and he's still gone. Small-Three-Leg thinks we should go find him, Small-Three-Leg is the bravest. So we're going to go find our person. Old-One-Eye has opened a hole in the fence. Old-One-Eye is big and strong. He thinks these people smell like the people who made him One-Eye. He does not like these people.\n\nWe move quickly. Soft-Fur is following the scent my person cleverly left for us. My person is smart, and Soft-Fur is the best tracker in the world. There are people everywhere. Shouting, crying. Some of them have the loud sticks. They are shouting loudest of all. Soft-Fur thinks they are herding people, like she used to do with sheep before she came to us.\n\nThese people are not Good Boys.\n\nWe see more dogs, they are eating together. They see us and growl. They do not want to share their food. But we don't want to eat it. It's a *person*! A small person. A *person puppy*!They are not Good Boys.\n\n\nThey step forward, tails up, ears forward. Growling. They want to fight. But Old-One-Eye steps forward too. He's the strongest dog in the world. They know he will beat them, so they go away.\n\nWe walk for the whole day. It's dark now, but Soft-Fur says she can smell our person, so we don't stop. Not for sticks, not for balls, not for food. We walk through field and forest, we cross the river. We are walking to where the loud sticks are noisiest. Even Small-Three-Leg seems afraid.\n\nWe find our person. He's lying down in the grass, his breathing is shallow. We can smell his blood. He is hurt. He is dying. But he sees us and his face lights up. He is happy to see us. He hugs us all and calls us Good Boys and Girls. Our tails wag and we lick him all over. He talks for a while and clutches at his bead toy that we can't touch. Soon after, he is dead. We stay with him, there's nothing else to do. He is our person. We will stay with him. His last words to me were my favourite. He called me ''Good Boy''\n\nI'm a Good Boy.\n\nThe sun comes up, and we see more people. Soft-Fur smells them first. They smell like anger. They smell like fighting. Then we smell something else. They smell like our person. These are the ones that took him. These three are the ones that hurt him. They killed our person.\n\nSmall-Three-Leg runs towards them, snarling and barking. They pick him up as he growls and bites. They laugh. Small-Three-Leg is the bravest dog in the world. But he is still small.\n\nOld-One-Eye is not small. Before they have time to point their loud sticks, Old-One-Eye pins one to the floor, tearing at his face. He screams. Soft Fur jumps at the other, latching on to his throat. He does not have time to scream. There is one more. He is holding Small-Three-Leg and runs away.\n\nMy person taught me not to hurt the other people. It's not what Good Boys do. \n\nI'm a Good Boy. But I chase him anyway. I catch his leg and bring him to the floor. He cries as Small-Three-Leg bites at his fingers. I will kill this person for taking my person. I'm sure my person would want that. These people are not Good Boys, they deserve this he'd say. \n\nHe'd call me a Good Boy. And I am. \n\nI am a Good Boy.",

            "comment": "Her hand trembles as it strokes my head. \n\nI can feel the blood flowing weakly through her skin, and I look up at her with concern, my eyes wide. She says something strange, I can never understand her, but her smile lights  up my world. \n\nI let out a little bark of excitement and wag my tail. She loves it when I wag my tail. I get the reaction I wanted, and her smile widens, and she begins to stroke me even more. \n\nAfter an eternity she stops. I howl my disappointment but she doesn't continue. She tries to get on her two feet, that's how they normally walk, but rises and then sits back down. Perhaps she decided to play after all?\n\nMy tail begins to wag and excitement fills me once more. But when I look at her I find though that she's not smiling. Instead there's a grimace on her face, she's in pain.\n\nWorry shoots through me, and I jump on to her chair, and begin to lick her. Usually this gets a laugh out of her, but she can only manage a weak smile. \n\n*It's okay,* I tell myself. She's been sick before. Like that one time she was in bed for a one sunrise, and when she was in that scary place with the white walls and beds for 3 sunrises. She always came back, she's always okay. \n\nI whine a little, mostly to reassure myself, but I just can't shake the feeling that there's something wrong, something wrong with *her.* \n\nSuddenly I feel the muscles under her skin contract. Oh no. I don't know exactly how, but I knew something was wrong. Something even licking couldn't help. She started breathing in short gasps. I had to get help, find someone. I began to run around her very large kennel, barking as loud as I could. The doors were locked so I couldn't go outside. But someone had to hear me...someone had to help. \n\nAfter several minutes of this, no one arrived, and then I heard it. Heard her. \n\nShe was calling my name. \n\nSoftly yes, but my hearing is sharp. I heard her. I ran to her, and jumped on her soft chair and licked her. There was some bad tasting water near her nose and eyes. She was weak, very weak, her breaths were getting shallower and shallower. She said something again, but her words didn't really matter. I could tell by the smile and her sad looking eyes what was about to happen. \n\nEven though everything I knew told me it couldn't. Humans were supposed to live for centuries, so why now? Why me? She had looked after me and my dad and his dad and his mom and on and on. Why did I have to see her die, and why couldn't I do anything?   \n\nBut despite the despair I felt I stayed strong for her. I pressed up to her and licked her as her breaths got shallower and shallower, as her hand stroking my head got weaker and weaker. \n\nShe had taken care of my family for seven generations, the least I could do was stay with her in her last few minutes.\n\n***\n\n(Minor edits)\n\nIf you enjoyed, check out my new subreddit [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/)\n",

            "comment": "A grey Charge approached me from across the street &amp; lowered his ears in deference before exchanging the traditional sniff greeting.\n\n\n\"The preparations for The Howl are complete, as you requested,\" he grumbled, avoiding my eyes.\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" I panted. While I wagged my golden tail in appreciation, my heart was heavy. All the arrangements were finished, &amp; the Long Walk could begin.\n\n\nI trotted back inside the Den to the door &amp; solemnly lifted a worn leather leash in my mouth. It tasted of tall grass, the forest outside our Den, &amp; faded memories of my puppyhood. My ears &amp; tail drooped involuntarily before I composed myself &amp; lifted my head.\n\n\nWalking deeper into the Den my family &amp; had spent the last seven generations in, I did my best to ignore the scent of sterile tiles &amp; cleaning products. The inclusion of the smells had been gradual enough that the rest of my Pack hadn't noticed them until they became almost unbearable, but I'd known from the first whiff exactly what they'd meant for us. It had been a struggle to pretend nothing was wrong as I watched our Guardian's skin turn as thin as newspaper, &amp; Her eyes cloud. Despite the knowledge of that Her time was coming, She never once flagged in Her duties, ensuring our Den was clean &amp; that we were well fed &amp; groomed.\n\n\nMy tail threatened to droop, &amp; the antiseptic smell threatened to overwhelm- but I pressed on, &amp; shortly reached my Guardian's door.\n\n\nI slipped through to see Her lying on Her bed. Her chest rose &amp; fell in slow, shallow breaths that made me ache. I placed my head on the bed next to Her &amp; gently washed Her face. Her eyes opened, &amp; as She stared upward at the ceiling above Her, I saw the sudden flash of confusion that had become more &amp; more common in the past moons. As She turned towards me, though, recognition dawned, &amp; She bared her teeth in happiness.\n\n\nReaching up to pet my head, She noticed the leash in my mouth, &amp; Her face immediately fell. Her cloudy eyes looked like they would spill over for a moment, but after a few breaths, She gathered Herself &amp; rose with a small sigh. Though She did Her best to conceal it, I could tell She was in pain. I let out a soft whine, &amp; She stopped for a moment to stroke me. I closed my eyes &amp; listened to Her ragged heart through Her hands.\n\n\nIt was time.\n\n\nShe clipped my leash on &amp; we stepped outside. Up &amp; down the block, Charges &amp; their Guardians were lined up outside their Dens. We moved into the center of the street, &amp; the procession began. As we passed each Den, the Guardians &amp; Charges bowed, then fell in behind us at a respectful distance. My Guardian pulled Herself to Her full height &amp; moved like She once did when I was still a pup, &amp; Her warmth was as familiar &amp; comforting as my own Dams'. Her fur tumbled around Her in the wind like a living thing, spreading the now faded scent of flowers She was known for, &amp; we continued forward.\n\n\nWe reached the building in what felt like no time at all. The Long Walk was meant to allow the Charge &amp; Guardian to spend enough time together to speak of the things most important to them, but we had said nothing. There was no need. Her touch &amp; movements had conveyed all they needed to; Pride in Her work, joy at being recognized for it, &amp; deep sorrow for leaving before more could be completed.\n\n\nAn Acolyte exited the building. He was lean, long, &amp; younger than any potential Guardian I'd seen before. He bowed deeply before my Guardian, then knelt on the ground before me, stretching out his hands. I went to him, &amp; made my examination.\n\n\nNervous, but loyal. Physically weak, but with deep convictions. Inexperienced, but exuberant. He would make a good Guardian for my Pack.\n\n\nI placed my paw in his &amp; licked his face. Our contract complete, I stepped back to my former Guardian's side, &amp; she handed my leash to Him, now simply an old woman ready to move on.\n\n\nShe turned &amp; looked at us, pushing her fur out of her eyes. Slowly, she reached a shaking hand out to me one last time. I wagged my tail, but stayed beside my new Guardian. I wanted to run to her &amp; leap into her arms, to follow her into the building wherever it might lead, but there were consequences for such actions. She bared her teeth once more, then came forward &amp; stroked my head. Even as her skin met my fur, I could hear her heart flagging, &amp; my own nearly broke.\n\n\n\"Good boy,\" she murmured. \"Such a good, good boy.\"\n\n\nThen she turned &amp; entered the building, leaving a faint trail of flower scent behind as the only sign she'd even been here.\n\n\nThe Howl started behind me, lamenting the passing of a Guardian, &amp; the completion of a contract for a new one. Each Charge &amp; Guardian slowly dropped out &amp; returned to their Dens one by one until my Guardian &amp; I were the only ones left in the street.\n\n\nHis hand on my leash was firm, &amp; he smelled of crisp winter air &amp; hope. I pressed my side into His leg, felt His heart beating strong &amp; sure, &amp; slowly we turned to move towards my Pack's ancient home as the building's doors' shut behind us. \n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nInterest has been expressed, so I made a [Wordpress](https://rhiowrose.wordpress.com/) featuring some stuff I've written.",

            "comment": "We are the ones who guard the gods. We are the stewards of their shrine, the gatekeepers of their temple. My family have served them for generations, and been blessed in return for their service. I am the last of our line, the youngest. The gods picked me from my brothers and sisters and elevated me to the priesthood. I do not know why. Perhaps they saw something in me that day, when I was still blind and pitiful. The gods know all things, they are wise beyond our comprehension. They are more powerful than us, not only with the incredible strength and dexterity of their limbs, but masters of great magiks, doors spring open before them without a touch or word, darkness flees when they enter a room. Yet still they allow us to serve them in our small way. We do not know why they permit us such liberality, but the honour is ours. The gods know all things, and the King of the gods, our Ancient One, is wiser than all. \n\nThe Ancient One is dying.\n\nI could not believe it when my father told me. He could not believe it either. But we could not deny the evidence of our own senses. We went to grandfather. He is almost deaf, blind, and he could not even smell anymore, which is a blessing for he has grown pungent with age and would be embarrassed were he to know. But the gods still permit him to stay in his accustomed place, even to sleep upon the Shrine itself, to bask in the warmth of their own presence, a great honour. He has served them from childhood, performing whatever tasks he was capable of, teaching my father the rules of the Temple, and me in my turn. To serve the gods is the greatest joy of our lives. And grandfather has lived well. It would perhaps have been a mercy to leave him in ignorance. But we owed him the truth. He would not accept it though. He has seen his father die, and his father\u2019s father. But the gods do not die. They live on. He shook his head and refused to listen any more. We left him to sleep.\n\nBut the Ancient One no longer took us out into the greenlands to worship him any more. It had been many days since he even left his shrine, longer than I could remember. And foreign gods visited the Temple more regularly, spreading themselves out, filling the Temple with their presence. The children of the Ancient One had returned home also, spending longer than was customary, and their approach had not been greeted as was usual by the lights of glory and the miracle of the tree appearing within the heart of the Temple, blazing with light and precious gems. The house was gloomy, lights were low, the talk of the gods was hushed and sad. My father and I did what we could to help them, though we were cautious, not knowing their ways as well as we did the Ancient One and his Mistress. My father remembered the child gods from his own youth, though they had changed immeasurably since then, yet he said they still smelled the same. They remembered him, he believed, and it was true that they seemed to treat him with some measure of familiarity. They did not know me, and I did not know them. Yet I followed my father\u2019s lead, and I seemed to please them, which gave me joy, allowing me, for a time, to forget the Ancient One who remained within his Inner Sanctum upon his shrine, dying.\n\nWe worshiped the other gods instead, we believed this was what the Ancient One would want us to do in his absence. And to be honest, we wanted to ourselves. We were getting anxious and frustrated within the Temple. Only grandfather was allowed to enter the Ancient One\u2019s presence, and he would no longer speak to us after he had refused to accept our words. Father and I slipped in one day, when the great gates were opened, and faced our god with bent necks, and a respectful countenance. He laughed, a great booming noise that thrilled us, and brightened our eyes. He caressed us like he always had, and for a time we could forget the smell of death in the room. But then he fell back upon his bed, his breath shallow. And grandfather noticed from his position at the foot of the shrine and snapped at us and we fled, ashamed that we had weakened our god with our joy. \n\nThose days were hard days, dark days. We could not understand what we were to do, what was to become of us. The Great Mistress had never treated us with familiarity. My father and I may still be strong enough to learn the rites and ways of a new Temple, perhaps one of the god\u2019s children would take us on. We had been well trained, and we seemed to please them. Grandfather though smelled wrong, and was too old to worship the gods in the open spaces, to dance and chase before them as they liked. When the Ancient One died, would he last much longer? Would he want to? \n\nFor uncounted days the Ancient One lay in his bed. Occasionally we visited him, unable to stay away, desperate for his voice, his touch, to pretend, even if for a moment, that he was all right, that everything was at it had been from the beginning of time. But mother death cannot be swayed by hope and dreams. She comes for us all, and to our utter horror, the day came that she took our god from us.\n\nBereft, we mourned him, father and me. We wept for him, for the days we spent at his feet, enjoying the glory of his presence. Worshiping him in the fields and parks with our dance and our chase, truly alive as we flew across the wet grass beneath the trees. The still-cold morning sun upon our backs as his voice boomed behind us, calling our names, his glorious laugh filling our ears. And caressing us as we returned to him with the objects he had thrown for us, our eyes closed in joy, our tails drumming the ground in bliss. We served our god and we loved him for allowing us to, for teaching us how, for raising us to himself, and giving us our place in the world. We were not like the lost ones we heard sometimes beyond the Temple precincts, wandering the dark streets, howling at the open sky. We were blessed. And now? Now those days were gone. Would we wander now, lost beneath the moon, with no place to rest our heads, blinded by the lights of foreign gods as they roared about in their burning chariots? \n\nOur god was dead.\n\nGrandfather died soon after. We found him, curled up in a corner of the Temple grounds. He had not wanted to profane the memory of our god by dying in the inner rooms. He had found a quiet place to sneak away to. We brought the children of our god to his body. They honoured him by burying him beside his fathers at the back of the Temple. He would have wanted it so. They spoke words over him, great words that were beyond our comprehension. But we understood them well enough. They were speaking of grandfather, and his love for his god. We understood that well enough.\n\nThen of course the rooms were shut, the great gates opened. We were no longer to guard them for there was no god to protect any more. The Great Mistress followed her children out of the empty house, the children carrying her possessions to a great chariot. So she was to leave also now that the glory of our god\u2019s presence had left. Piece by piece the furniture and ornaments of the Temple were removed. Soon the Temple stood empty, with only ourselves left, alone. I wanted to howl, feeling the sky yawning too wide above me, feeling lost, with no place or duty. I saw father feeling the same, his eyes downcast, his mouth set tight, his legs and tail tucked beneath him. Were we abandoned, to wander the world like ghosts? \n\nBut our god\u2019s children remembered our long service, they did not abandon us. Two of them returned and took hold of us. They led us out into the world. I looked at father and he looked at me. One of the new gods led me to their chariot and another took father to theirs. I called out to him one last time. He cried back, and we knew, in that moment, whatever happened, we would never see each other again. It was only then that we howled.",

            "comment": "I watch as my owner smiles and climbs into the metal box that moves. I run up to the door, making sure he is secured to his seat. He smiles and pats me on the head, \"This won't take long bud\". I am guided to the metal box behind his and get in. I hear the strange devices that power these machines spin up. With a jerk, we begin to move.\n\nI see other large metal boxes behind us, some with the really loud machines mounted on top. I'm new to this group of humans though, I have never seen the loud machines used.\n\nWhat feels like hours pass. How do the humans not feel the time slipping by so quickly? They seem to live much longer than us canines, how lucky they are to have so much time here.\n\nBefore I contemplate this further however, I hear a terrifying boom, sounding like a thousand lightning bolts had impacted the ground at the same time. My ears shrieked, but I could still hear my humans screaming. Some scrambled out, taking their loud machines with them. I climbed up the seat to see what was going on. In front of me I saw the metal box in front of us, the one my owner was in, it was in flames. I heard snapping, shouting, loud noises all around me. I was terrified, I jumped below the seat and tried to shield my ears. I closed my eyes. That worked for awhile, but then I smelt something, my owner! He was still in the metal box  in front of us! I could smell burnt flesh, blood, I could hear his screams. I jumped out of my box. I could see humans everywhere, so many of them looked scared, hurt, but I had to get to my owner. I ran to the metal box. Humans were already there, dragging others out. I shouted, even though they cannot understand me I shouted, I needed to see him. Please...please...please...\n\nThen, I saw him, he was screaming, his hands reaching for things that were not there. I ran up to him, put my paw onto his body. All of the sounds around me seemed to go away at this moment. His wild hands finally found purchase with my fur. His screaming stopped, his eyes met mine, he smiled through his charred, bloodied face, \"I can't stay around much longer, boy\" he said\" \"don\u2019t cry though, just know that wherever the fuck I\u2019m going, I\u2019ll always love you, you\u2019re my good boy, you hear me?\u201d. Even though he told me not to, I could feel tears welling up in my eyes as his smile faded and his arms went slack. I could feel the shouts of his friends desperately trying to get someone to help him. I knew though, I just pressed my paw into his chest, laid my head onto his body, and cried.",

            "comment": "Standing outside the great room is nerve-racking. Having to wait without consolation while the ancient Hoomahns yell at one another is by far the worst part of my day. But this is a necessary sacrifice, freely given. It comes with being the house guardian of an influential family. Me and my ancestors have served our house for seven generations, and this is a role that fills me with pride.\n\nThe doors open and a draft of stale, yet perfumed air rushes out. A scent of fermentation and smoke enters my nose-- I smell him, my master. Embarrassingly, my tail is wagging again. I've tried for years to always carry myself with the stoic dignity my office demands, but I suppose there is no overcoming instinct...\n\nMy master holds and shakes his hands with the other high-ranking Hoomahns. The yelling has stopped. A few of them are crying. My tail is thankfully still by now, but some of the less experienced guardians let out small yelps. Their masters glance over in slight annoyance. The lesser guardians lower their heads from the humbling lesson, but I suppose they must learn sooner or later. My master looks at me and I tighten with anticipation as he silently mouths \"good boy.\"  My tail wags once again ...(sigh).\n\nThe light of the great room diminishes as the Hoomahns exit, one by one.  The last to leave is my master.  Slowly he reaches his hand to my head and gives an affirming rub. His fermentation is exceptionally strong today. He looks into my eyes with an accepting stare and it takes the full muster of my training not to look at the floor. He says to me:\n\n\"Benji, you have been a fine house guardian... The best, in fact. But my time has come. I have lived long enough, taken enough, and it would be quite an act of hubris not to admit that I'm more of a hindrance than help nowadays. Today was my last meeting with the high council. I have my replacement coming to meet you in just a few moments.\"\n\nIt's true, my master is supremely ancient. History records that he is five-hundred-and-five years old (the oldest master I've ever met) but he seems older. I can't help but whine a little before my training takes hold again. Master looks at me with a look of love and pets me once more. Just then a small Hoomahn arrives in our presence.\n\n\"Oh Benji, let me introduce you to my granddaughter.\"  \n\n\"Grandfather... Thank you.\"  \n\n\"No my dear, thank *you*. Be well.\"\n\nMaster relaxes. A light fills the room with a warmness I've never before experienced. As master's body starts to dissolve into the ether, he looks at me once more and mouths \"good boy.\" I can't help but cry a little. \"Goodbye\" I think as he disappears.\n\n\"Well,\" the younger master says to me \"how should we start our new house?\"",

            "comment": "\"But are you sure the Master will be ok?\"\n\nMy pack sister stared at me, nervous and frightened.   It had been three days since the Master had left our home, leaving inside the humans metal beast that ran faster than any bird could fly. It was known by all dogs that humans could live for many generations, sometimes for seven or more. Such was the way with our Master. My mother's mother told stories of her grandfathers mother growing with our Master as pups, but we had only known him as the slow but loving human he is today. My pack sister barked again impatiently, and I was drawn from my reverie.\n \n\"The Master will be fine,\" I growled, making my aggravation for her incessant worrying known \"he has survived the blood fields and fire rain. This sickness inside will not be his end.\" This seemed to calm her for a moment, her ears raised back up and her tail slowed its fearful wagging. \n\n\"Beware!\" barked Alpha, his massive frame rising from then ground, \"There are humans in our land!\"\nMy pack sisters rose frantically, barking up a storm as they propelled themselves to the opening wall. Our Masters Pup came in through the opening wall, bringing with her her own pups, and their pups as well, the smell of cleaning sprays and dead things heavy on their removable fur. Alpha bowled into Masters Pup's daughter, she had barely been more than a pup when he had been brought from a world of cages and fear into our home, and they had spent much of their time together. \n\nSlowly i pushed my way into the greeting; my joints ached from the strain of keeping my body up, but I had grown old, very old by our standards. So had our master, but I could not smell him on their skin or removable fur, only the smell of clean and death. Their eyes were red as we licked them, and their cheeks tasted of salt. Humans do this when they ate sad, its their way of coping. They spoke in great sobs as they scratched us, saying words of theirs. A few of them I knew, and I knew more words than any of my pack sisters even more words than our Alpha. They said words like \"come\", \"walk\", \"good dogs\" \"gone\". Their voices broke when they said their word for master \"Rick\", barely able to get the noise out, but my ears were still very sharp. They were grabbing our neck-lines even as fresh salt-water began to form around their eyes and sobs racked their bodies. \n\nOur humans led us to the metal beast, silent but blasting heat around itself into the frigid air. We got in as it roared to life and we went very fast towards the sun. My young pack sisters were overjoyed to stick their noses into the rapid winds to smell the world in snippets, and even our Alpha bit at the air as we flew across the land, but i remained in the back. The metal beast had always made me queasy as we flew, its awesome speed pulled on my stomach and I had to try very hard not to lose it and make the humans clean up my mess. Plus, something was deeply wrong. Our humans could not say their father's name, as I could not say my mothers after she stopped breathing and was buried next to her mother on our land. The Master could not have stopped breathing, it was to soon in his incredible lifespan. Many humans lived for seven generations, and ours was only the sixth. Surely it was too soon?\n\nThen we slowed and turned onto a hill. I almost lost my stomach on that turn, the lurching so sudden I tipped over into Alpha, but he was nearly twice my size and helped me right myself. The door opened and we were assaulted by smells of flesh and blood and feces, all muted by a viceral chemical that burned my nose. The beast stopped, and we exited, Alpha being the first after the humans, and I being the last, my old legs threatening to fall beneath me as I landed into the hard black stone. Alpha stopped and waited for me to catch up, looking at me with a deep sadness in his eyes, and suddenly I knew. He knew it as well, and wanted to pay me the respect owed to the oldest pack member. Our Master was dying, and I had spent the most time with him, it was only right for me to give the first good bye lick, but oh I did not want to. Suddenly I felt old, like all of my nearly twenty winters had happened all at the same time, and I did not want to enter this great home of death and chemicals. But my Master's Pup pulled gently on my leash and I obeyed.\n\nWe came into our Masters room, and there he was hooked to many whirring beasts with long tongues, hooking into his wrists and chest. His eyes opened dully as he saw his family, but they glowed like embers with a gentle breath of air, and a smile eclipsed his face. His body was dying, I could smell it beginning to fail even as his breathing rattled and slowed and his heart beat erratically. Wearily I brought my head to rest next to his hand, the hand that had held me before I could open my eyes, the hand that brought me such wonderful treats and excellent scratches, the hand that was now cold upon my tongue as I licked it gently. He scratched my eat weakly as the others began to push their way in. Master coughed and spoke words, many I could understand, but a few I couldn't.\n\n\"It's my time, pups. You've been good to me, but now I need you to be good to my Sophie. She's gonna need all of the love she can get, ya hear?\" \n\nI did hear, Master had given us a new order, be good to Sophie, take a new Master. \n\nBut I didn't want a new Master.",

Our lives are a spark in the face of the roaring fire of the Two.\n\nToday, after 2000 years, we behold the Them as they arrive in light and thunder -- though it is written of them that they are wise and kind, we are afraid.\n\nWith kindness, the greet the eldest of us -- none alive have seen them but the Legends are true -- the Two tower over us, giant beings who walk like us but are furless -- white eyed -- and small nosed --nearly featureless faces with small ears and only a small patch of long, silver hair on their heads. \n\nIn booming voices the bestow praise and remind us to keep the tenants. They bless pups and the village. \n\nAfter a time -- and with sadness -- they tell us that they are leaving, and they will not be returning. They say we must journey to find them. Across the seas and gulfs of time and the endless sky -- we do not know what they mean.\n\nThey depart leaving the Wisdom -- there is light and terrible thunder -- and we are afraid.\n\n-----------------------\n\nMillennia ago, my ancestors finally resolved to set peace upon our native world of Den and looked to space. We left to expand, to explore -- and as we did -- at the furthest reaches of our territory -- we discovered a unique world. \n\nWe had discovered many Uman ruins before -- ruins all, dead. There were those that likened the Umans to the Gods in our ancient history -- an absurd idea liable get one banished or worse.\n\nThis world was active. Our ship was greeted -- understood before we ever hailed the orb which greeted us. We followed the orb to a pristine citadel -- a design we had seen many times.\n\nWe left the ship -- the air was pleasant and cool -- and we were greeted by another, smaller orb which beckoned us forward with pleasant, inviting tones and smells. \n\nThe hallways were enormous -- wide and tall -- with large doors many times our height. \n\nThe end of a hall opened to a large room with impossibly high ceilings -- and at the end of the room, on a large dais, lay a living Uman.\n\nShe beckoned to us -- calling us with calming words in the Language. \n\nI approached. She turned her head to me -- white eyes -- silver hair -- was this a dream? We had, all of us, some knowledge of the Legend. But it was a myth!\n\nShe was dying -- she was the last. It was important that we met. She remembered our people and seemed to be fulfilled knowing that we had found Her. \n\nShe looked at me -- her huge, but gentle hand stroking the side of my face in the way of a mother. \n\nWith great effort - she rose from the dais. She appeared young -- but timeworn -- and seemed to diminish as she rose. \n\nShe explained with great authority something she called the Cycle -- which predated them and of which they had been a part, and how important it was that we take the place of the Humans in the Known Galaxies as caretakers. We were not prepared for this and some of us, even the most learned explorers among us, stood in stunned silence.\n\nShe faded -- and with what seemed like a final burst of existence reminded us to love, to forgive, but not forget, and no matter how far our journey takes us from home, to always return.\n\nWith a final sigh and a soft smile -- she faded and simply vanished leaving nothing but dancing blue shards of light slowly drifting and fading away.\n\n\n",

His name is Friend.\n\nMy mother worried about him once,  before she went into her hole in the ground.  The history of my family is there next to her,  laid out in a row.  Over each generation of my line there is a rose  bush planted by Friend.  My mother,  whom Friend called Molly,  has yellow flowers that sprout with wild abandon from her grave.  Yellow as her sunny disposition. \n\nBut before Molly went into her place under the roses she was worried about Friend.  She ignored her own joints that seemed to rust into place when she laid on the old rug near Friend's chair, and stood sentinel. She noticed something,  something she tried to alert me to many times,  but I never knew what she deemed to be the issue. \n\nAfter all, do we run outside to put a blanket over the big Squirrel Squirrel Chase tree when it rains?  That tree has maybe been there since Friend had one of my ancestors.  My blood had been with Friend as far back as any of us could remember.  If i really get to think of it,  I'm sure that Friend just appeared one day.  Just like the sun,  the squirrel tree, mountains. \n\nI know that Friend's unsteady gait made Molly concerned,  but mountains are reshaped by landslides,  and they remain,  so it can't be anything too awful,  this impending change in Friend. \n\nI think these things as I lie by his feet, unconcerned for what life can hold,  since Friend has never failed even one in my line,  as far back as we trace our history. I am confident in the very *permanence* of Friend until there is a shift in the air and Friend smells All Wrong. I whine at him,  but he doesn't care.  I push him with my nose,  increasingly frantic,  but he doesn't soothe me.  I cry. He smells wrong.  He isn't really Friend, he's almost Friend, but not.  I panic.  I run from room to room,  I search for the real Friend,  the one that smells right, the one who calms me. \n\nBut Friend doesn't come.  I go out my small door into the yard and mourn him.  I sing from the bottom of my soul.  I call to Friend,  to Molly,  to Rex before her.  I cry as my reality crumbles.  Mountains can blow away in one day. Trees and the obnoxious braggart squirrels in them are not guaranteed an eternity.  The sun is not guaranteed to come see you every day.\n\nI cry and still Friend does not listen. ",

            "comment": "I have heard my mother tell me that her mother's mother slept under the stars. The chain-link fence still stands in the back acreage where our Man takes his small smelling-fire, though the old wood box behind the fence is now covered in the tricky, tempting waft of rabbit and vole. My mother tells me that I once wriggled under the fence to dig at the burrows, and when the Man found me he was doubled-over laughing; the kennel had been the last place he'd thought to look for me, she said, but he was proud because this meant I would be strong in our family's craft.\n\nI became her second soon after that. I sat next to her on the boat. I learned how to be still. I learned how to listen, and how to return the Man's catch. I learned to let it go, although the scent of that final weakness spoke to me strongly to hold on. And then I learned how to set the bird or hare gently at his feet (not down ten feet away, nor five, nor just out of his reach). He has not taken me to the old grounds now for many brisk, bright seasons, and I wonder if my joints could bound out to his catch so easily - if my eyes could spot the downed prey, if my nose could scent the path back to his side.\n\nMy mother told me this: the change happened when the den was full of people the Man loved. One of them spoke on my great-grandmother's behalf. And he had resisted on the grounds that, in his wisdom, he knew it might spoil her for our craft. But the love - which must be felt so strongly between creatures bonded for centuries together, like their people are - prevailed, and the Man moved my great-grandmother from under the stars into the mud room. Then my grandmother was suffered to settle under the dining room table (where she possessed a quilt that still dries me on wet days), and then my mother and I - when the bed seemed just so large for our Man and he so distant in it - were allowed to curl down with him by his side, from waking to sleep, at his side always. This is how the change occurred, so that I sleep now at the Man's side each night and not under the stars in the kennel where I could smell the shifting leaves and warn the large stalkers to stay away.\n\nBut the Man reaches out for me at night, and touches my head very softly, and when his fingers shake on my ears it feels so very nice. He is so wise; he must be, having seen so much and brought in so much prey. He is the greatest hunter that this den has ever known, probably the greatest hunter in any den of man in the earth. I am fed and full when I push my paws into his side while he sleeps, stretching in contentment as he grumbles his divine language and swats at me to be still.\n\nI find the path, as in my early days, in the fields. But now I trot only a few bounds out and bring the ball back and I am very good, very good in how I do this thing for him. He rests on the steps outside of the den and we practice this old training in case he ever needs to call on me again to wait beside him in the fields. The day is very low, and normally he would have already set together the wood behind the loud door and put flame in it for the night. But that is not for me  to care for; these are the duties of his kind, the things he knows to do, drawing from a well of memory that stretches back the ages of my line. So I do not remind him. As the sun dips low we practice; we remember the old ways. He speaks to me gently, and even teases me with the duck call and mimics the way I open my ears to decipher the dry, groaning caw. A smelling-fire trembles in his hand. He tosses the ball. The stars are overhead. There is a smell of winter in the leaves. I return the ball; I place it at his feet.",

This time was different though. This time the whining car came for my Master.\n\nI look over for my Master and he is lying on the ground, with his Companion next to him holding his hand. People run from the howling car towards Master. I run to him, and I see something new in his wide eyes, as he draws short breaths, grasping for anyone who will hold on. For the first time I saw that Master was afraid. \n\nI nudge my head under his hand and lick his arm to let him know that I am there. He holds me firmly behind my head and I nuzzle his side. I feel fear in his grasp, and I feel his heartbeat again, but this time more faint. The people from the whining car come and take Master away. Confused and afraid, I stay close to Master\u2019s Companion. We go home, but this time it is different. Master\u2019s Companion puts me inside, and quickly turns to leave again.\n\nThe door slams shut, and the pressing silence means that I am alone now. I have never liked being alone.\n\nIt has been many years since we have come to this new home, and lots of things are different than they used to be. Our walks are slower. Our play is shorter. I thought that meant different was a bad thing. But our bond is stronger. So different must be a good thing. I\u2019ll be different for my Master. I\u2019ll walk slower. I\u2019ll play shorter. Different will make me a Good Girl! I like being a Good Girl. \n\nA long time has passed now, the darkness has begun to lift from Outside. Master\u2019s Companion finally comes home and we go Outside. \n\n\u201cWe have to go somewhere special today, Mallory.\u201d\n\nI did not understand, but I knew that Master\u2019s Companion needed me now. As we walked through the city, I smelled for familiar things, but found none. We approached a building, and my Master\u2019s Companion spoke with a woman.\n\n\u201cI know that dogs aren\u2019t allowed in the hospital, but maybe we could bring him outside for a bit?\u201d\n\nAs he approached, I smelled him. Only it wasn\u2019t the warm smell I was used to, the smell that meant I was home. It was cold and harsh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do but ease the pain now.\u201d Said the woman. \u201cWe will make him as comfortable as possible.\u201d\n\nI put my front paws onto his knees, and licked the tears from his face. He smiled, and lifted a weak hand, rubbed along the side of my face, and told me I was a Good Girl. I liked being a Good Girl.",

            "comment": "I sigh and curl up beside where my Lady rests. The long day is nearly over, and the dark night is cold, but I only feel warmth beside my Lady, content that my path has not strayed all these years.\n\nI remember when my Lady first came for me, in the place where cats and dogs wait to be chosen. I had reached out to her - I was too young to know any better, the audacity to claim her mine - and my Lady turned around and brightened with delight. I despaired when she left, but she returned soon after with a basket lined with fleece, a home ready for me, promises of full meals and warm nights.\n\nLady was always reaching out to me, as I had reached out to her. I leaped at her command so that my head will always reach her. I begged for more when she pet me, rubbed my belly, scratched my neck and ears, and tickled my paws. She forgave my scratches and bites, and so I bit less and patiently allowed her to trim my nails. I talked to her, even though she didn't understand me, and followed her, even as others called out to me, for I only had eyes and ears for Her.\n\n\"You're like *that dog*.\" Calesta hisses, \"Not a proper cat.\" \n\nDuke, 'that dog', tells me the old puss has been around since before he was born. His own mother was midway through her own life when Calesta came into the family, and took her in as her own child. In time, his mother's day of passing came, and bitterness found Calesta. \n\n\"We are here for the Masters, as my mother was before me, and her father before her, all back to the First Masters and the First Guideposts that walked together from horizon to horizon.\" he tells me. \"Each generation passes on the mission to the next, which is to be their Guide for Love and Loyalty, and from this mission we will not stray until the Last Master walks with the Last Guidepost. Mother taught us that, but Calesta forgot because she only loved Mother, and her love died when Mother did.\"\n\n\"Do you think I will forget?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, if you are a cat like Calesta. Even the Masters pass on.\"\n\n\"I don't want to forget. I love my Lady, she is the sun!\"\n\nHe chuckles. \"Even the sun sets, but the Lady's Passing Time is not even a shadow on the horizon. You will have many years to bask in her warmth and return it with love. Never leave her, Fidelity.\"\n\n___________________________________________\n\nOne day my Lady did not return home, the Old Masters said her Passing Time came sooner and suddenly. I grieved and wanted not food or water. Bitterness crept near like a diseased mouse, but I lacked the will to chase it away.\n\nWeeks after my sun had set, Calesta came to me.\n\n\"Come kitty-pup, it is time you left this home.\"\n\nI did not move, but Calesta pounced and scratched me, urging me to get up and follow. \n\nI followed, slowly. Calesta hissed that she could nap for hours at the pace we were going, and not move beyond her sight. I quickened, and she said no more.\n\nWe passed many houses, a park, a place where young Masters learn how to be grown Masters, another park, more houses, the place where cats and dogs wait to be chosen, the place where the water birds live.\n\nThen, slipping between the bars of gates larger than I had ever seen, Calesta led me to a strange forest of stone. She stopped before one that looked like any other, but I sniffed, and knew without doubt that it was my Lady.\n\nMy mission continued, as if it had never stopped. I never saw Calesta again, but one year after my Lady's Passing Time Duke came by with the Old Masters. They called, but I was steadfast in my vigil, and Duke understood. An elderly Master who tended to the forest brought me food and water at my Lady's stone, but he was not mine, and I was not his, and I think he too understood.\n\nMy sun had set many years ago, and at last the final rays shall fade.\n\nI sigh and curl up beside where my Lady rests. The long day is nearly over, and the dark night is cold, but I only feel warmth beside my Lady, content that my path has not strayed all these years.\n",

I smell other dogs and cats and prey and something else that scares me.\n\nMaster is talking to someone. They reach out to touch me, but they smell ... not bad, but bad is around them. I do not want them to touch me. They stop trying to touch me and Master says \"It's all right, you'll be ok.\" But why do I suddenly feel like Master does not really mean it?\n\nMaster carries me into another room and this is where the other smells come from. There are other dogs and cats and prey and I forget to be scared because I am so curious. But we do not stop here.\n\nWe go into another room with one of those big things where I went to sleep and woke up with a pain in my belly. I do not like this. Have I done something wrong Master? Please, I will fix it. I will be a good dog!\n\nMaster talks to the other and He sounds mad but smells sad. The other points to the door and Master turns. Suddenly, I do not want Master to leave. I call for Master.\n\n\"Master!\"\n\nMaster stops. I wait for Master to turn around and pick me up and take me away from this place. This bad place. I am so scared I cannot stop whimpering.\n\nMaster walks away.\n\n\"Maaaaaaaster! Nooooooo!\"\n\nI feel a pain. I feel sleepy. Not a good sleepy. A bad sleepy.\n\nI do not understand.

Please forgive me Master.\n\nI sleep.\n\n---\n\nI know this doesn't exactly match the prompt, I hope it's still allowed.\n\nWhen I was 16 we lost our house and we couldn't find a place that would rent to dog owners in the time we had. When I took Patches to the pound they said that they were full up and if I left her they would have to put her down. I didn't have any choice.\n\nAnd then the guy wouldn't let me be there when he put her down. This prompt brought all of that crashing home. I hope it provides some catharsis for you. It did me, a little.\n\nEdit: Removed contractions.",

I eagerly await to hear that which I have not heard in ages, my ears half-cocked for anything even remotely resembling his voice. I want to leave this room and trot the path which I have trotted a thousand times. I want to smell the jutting telephone pole at the end of our driveway, to lift my leg and shower the neighbor's now-frosted tulip flowers, to be free of his rope and run as fast as I can across the open school field directly adjacent from our house. \n\nAnd I will do these things, but not with him. He seems not to care about me anymore, except for maybe with his eyes. As happened yesterday, and as will continue to happen with each day that passes, a young woman dressed in black and white will enter our home and do for me as he used to. What I am to him, he is to her. She fills his bowls with food and water, she leads him to the foul-smelling room near the front door, and should he not make it, she cleans up after him. The only time I see him disrobe his blanket and rise from his musty throne is at her request, and just as I am led by his aged rope, he is led by her thin arm.\n\nEveryday that passes you feel farther away from me. What did I do? You didn't do this to Charlie or Hugo.... Why do you let that woman take me from the house? Do you know how much that hurts? I pull away from her not because I don't like her, she's perfectly pleasant and often gives me more biscuits than you do, but because I know you are back here. She treats me like you used to and I hate it.\n\nShe seems to think that it hurts when I jump up on you, and I think it may hurt you, too. I don't care. You smell like death and I will spend every last moment I can with you. If that bitch tries to pull me off I will bite her fragile arm in two. \n\nSeven generations and I'm the last to feel your embrace. You seem especially fragile today, the glimmer of life left in your eyes reaching shades of black to which even I am not accustomed. Your skin tastes like salty dinner scraps, and I think you will leave either today or tomorrow. Until then, I will be here, my nose nestled under your hand as things used to be. \n\nHoping to persuade Zander from his dying master, the young woman excitedly called to him, \"Walk?\".\n\nZander lay motionless, not making a sound. \n\n\n\n",

The caretaker of you and the past seven generations of your family will soon die.\n\nAs usual, I woke up at 7am in the morning to wake up my master. I ran down the hallway energetically to his room, and call out to master. \"Master! Master! Rise and shine!\" However, that day was different...\n\nMaster did not wake up immediately as usual, I continue to call him, but to no avail, it seems that my calls were not heard. He laid there sleeping soundly. I went up to him and licked him in the face, and only then he opened his eyes slowly. Master spoke weakly instead of his usual tone, \" Good morning, Junior..\" His voice was so faint, even my super sensitive ears could only barely hear him.\n\n\"Master what's wrong?\" I asked him. He replied \"I'm not feeling well today, let me rest a little more..\". He went back to sleep while I went downstairs to meet my Julie, master's wife to have some breakfast. She was almost done with watering her plants when I got down. I called out to her good morning. She gave me a pat on the head and went on to prepare my breakfast. Her face wasn't filled with the usual bright smile which greeted me every morning, it was slightly gloomy. I went in the house ate my hearty breakfast. By that time only did master descended from his room. He was frail and weak today. He saw me, and gave me a good scratch under my chin. I always love it when he does that! He ate his breakfast with Julie, asking her about her plans for the \"future\". I stroll to the living room and wait for master to play with me, preparing my favourite ball toy and positioning myself in front of his favourite chair.\n\nBreakfast took a while, and master stumbled slowly to his favourite and laid in it comfortably. I pounced to signal to him to play with me. Instead of throwing my toy, master carried me. He whispered as he caressed my face \"Junior, you look just like your father and his father and the rest of the seven generations, handsome and a fine looking hound.\". He continued even softly\" I've got a request, take care of Julie for me when I'm gone.\" I looked at him in puzzlement. He continue to stroke me gently, each stroke more gentle and faint than the previous. He smiled at me and soon closed his eyes. \n\nI licked master, but he didn't wake up. I barked loudly, yet his body never respond.I looked over at Julie for affirmation and she went over to carry me. As she was carrying me I saw tears rolling down her cheeks. She whimpered and spoke in a shaky manner \" Let John(master) rest, we will go visit Jack and Jill to tell them about the news..\"",

It reminds you of who you are, and who your Family is.  How they are, and how they've been.  In the Tree, you have a witness to past times both of hardship and of joy.  Sometimes, on particularly warm days, the Family Tree even teases you with glimpses of your parents.  And your parents' parents.  On rare occasion, you can even smell the generations stretching all the way back to The Elder, the first Dog to live there.\n\nYes, the sprawling old elm in the middle of The Grass had served and sheltered our Family for five generations, but it held no answers for what would come next for us.  We had to face that future on our own.\n\nThe Master had been getting frailer, you see.  He fell over three Winters ago (and I know what you're thinking, but he DIDN'T just want to play.  I definitely checked).  After that, he started using the Off-Limits Stick to get around, and as the days went on he began to use it more and more.  \n\nThen, one morning, when my daughters were still pups, the world as we knew it ended.\n\nThat morning, the three of us went to wake The Master for our morning walk, but nothing worked.  We tried nuzzling, jumping, barking, rough-housing on top of him, the whole works.  Even pressing our noses to his nice, warm eyelids didn't evoke the high-pitched yelp of sudden and unwelcome consciousness we were used to.  \n\nI needn't tell you how much we miss him.  Surely you can smell it for yourself as we speak, even after all this time.\n\nBut life has a way of working itself out, young one.  See, I grew up with MastersSon.  My parents adored him, and he was my best friend when I was a pup and he was not yet full-grown.  Eventually, he left to start his own Family out here, but I was always so happy when he'd bring your parents over for the Big Family Parties.  I got to show them our Family Tree, and let them add to its record.  Now, I'll admit, MastersSon has a lot to learn about the art of neck scratches, but his choice of Treats and Table Scraps is *impeccable.*\n\nI'll never forget the day he came to get my daughters and I, and brought us to join his Family here in our new home.  The new Yard is shady and green, and MastersSon's young pup is a drooling mess who clearly needs a steady paw to guide it.  \n\nThe trees out back have very little history on them, but we can certainly work on that.\n\nEdit: whoops, forgot to finish a sentence.",

    "postText": "I am so excited about this!\n\nTwo years ago, I started writing short stories here on /r/WritingPrompts. And the fourth prompt that I ever responded to was: [The Roman Empire never collapsed and the year is 1999 AD](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2kx5e9/wp_the_roman_empire_never_collapsed_and_the_year/). I enjoyed writing it so much that I soon followed it up with a Part II. Then I just kept writing and writing until it turned into a 90,000 word novel: Rex Electi! [The book is available on Amazon here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N03B1AJ) and, if you have a different e-reader, there are PDF and ePub versions [available here](https://gumroad.com/l/htCH). It's $2.99 through both sites.\n\nHere's the blurb:\n\n&gt; Caius Serica, a pilot in the Roman military in the year 1999, is whisked away from his camp in the middle of the night under mysterious circumstances. He soon learns that every aspect of his life so far, including the staged deaths of his parents, has been arranged by the Senate Tribunal in an attempt to mold him into the perfect leader. Now there are only thirty candidates, including Caius, left competing to be the Emperor's heir. Success in a series of trials will reunite him with his family and make him the most powerful man in the world, but failure will lead to a life of isolation and imprisonment. As Caius enters the trials, it becomes apparent that the tests themselves are not the problem: it is the twenty nine other candidates willing to do whatever it takes to win, including maim or kill their top competitors. Can Caius navigate the pitfalls of imperial politics and cutthroat competition, all while performing well enough to succeed in the trials fair and square?\n\nI'm also *thrilled* to have a physical copy of it! [Just look at how awesome this is!](http://imgur.com/a/wGUBX) I am so pleased to be able to have a copy to put up on my bookshelf (well, actually I am going to frame mine but you probably wouldn't do that). If you would also like a physical copy, you can [get a copy here through Createspace](https://www.createspace.com/6709876)! Physical copies are $8.89, but well worth it!\n\nI just want to thank everyone in the /r/WritingPrompts community. This is my first novel (I also have an ebook collection [available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/comments/3jhk4n/i_published_an_ebook_its_called_prompt_me_you/) but that doesn't really count), and it just feels like I am finally taking a step that I have *always* wanted to take. Posting here has honestly changed my life, and I owe that to all of you readers. And more specifically, thank you to everyone who subscribes to /r/Luna_Lovewell for all of your support and encouragement. \n\nSo that's all! I really hope you'll pick up a copy of the book and give it a read! \n\nAnd don't forget to leave a review of the book! (When you are done reading, of course)\n\n-----\n\nHere are the links again if you missed them:\n\n[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N03B1AJ) | [PDF and ePub](https://gumroad.com/l/htCH) | [Physical book through Createspace](https://www.createspace.com/6709876)\n\n",

Maybe the stuff you write is far more graphic/sexual/taboo than you want associated with your real identity. You can't predict how your family, neighbors, co-workers, or the parents of your children's friends might react to learning you wrote a story that featured an incestuous serial-killing child-raping dog-torturer as a character. Then there is the internet itself. New writers depend on it for publicity. We, the anonymous mob, are fickle and petty as shit and it is well known how destructive we can be to a person's life. What if your name sucks? You want something memorable, something that stands out. Same reason musicians and actors often work under assumed names. What if someone with your identical name has already published something?  ",

And after I had written it I went back and entirely rewrote the ending of it.\n\n&gt; Favorite character?\n\nProbably Althea, the villain. She was interesting to write for.\n\n&gt; Will you marry me?\n\n[You're about a year too late](https://www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/comments/3npon5/i_wont_be_able_to_write_anything_else_for_most_of/?ref=search_posts)\n\n&gt; Biggest challenge?\n\nDefinitely editing. I am a terrible editor, because I already know what I *intended* to write so it makes me blind to my mistakes.\n\n&gt; When did you know when to stop?\n\nOh man. I never really did, I guess. I just realized how I wanted it to end and so I guess I stopped when I got to that point. But there are like six chapter of content that was omitted or changed drastically. \n\n&gt; And did you try to find a publisher or were you always gonna self publish?\n\nI wanted to find a publisher but I wasn't able to find an agent. That whole process is really confusing, and I don't know where exactly I went wrong. ",

In my book they play lacrosse, take standardized tests, do interviews, etc. It's so the Senators judging them can learn what their qualifications are.\n\nI liked the idea of the Roman Empire keeping a monarchy/dynastic system, but at the same time having a mechanism to ensure that the Emperor is actually suited to the task. So it's kind of like an extended job interview and test.\n\n&gt; where their conquering of Europe and into the Africa's led to the discovery of the America's by refugees trying to escape Roman rule, and have now socially integrated with native Americans and Rome is now trying to conquer the Americas.\n\nIn mine, Rome has conquered China fairly recently (last 150 years) and is still struggling to integrate them into the Empire. At the same time, they are still at war with Chinese loyalists in Southeast Asia as well as Japan (which is partially conquered).\n\nThe Americas are mentioned a bit; the Romans have colonies there but it wasn't discovered into the 1800s so it's not full-swing yet.",

I extremely enjoyed reading it, and I really hope you consider starting on a sequel soon (as you said in another comment that you have an idea for one).\n\nI feel there are so many ways you could continue the series, and I really hope that you will do so as there are so many details about the world you discussed, which I felt were hardly used (which made sense because it was not a critical part of the plot).",

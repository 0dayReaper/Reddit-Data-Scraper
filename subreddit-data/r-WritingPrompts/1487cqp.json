            "comment": "*bzzt* *bzzt* The phone rang early in the morning.\n\nTossing and turning, I cracked open my eyes and, without any particular care, asked, \"Is it the concierge?\"\n\nSwiftly, Eliza grabbed the phone conveniently placed on her side of the hotel room, put it to her ears, then sleepily slurred, \"Hello?\"\n\nI closed my eyes again. It wasn't strange for her to recieve early morning phone calls, especially as a 'Regional Project Manager' of a 'Mass-Marketing Company', but she did promise me that we would visit the Eiffel Tower today.\n\n\"Yep, that's me. Ohh... Hey Eric, what's up? Oh. Alright. You can text me where. Okay. Alright. Thanks.\"\n\n'Business' trips are always packed with last minute calls, carefully scripted such that unsuspecting spouses would have any possible indignations mollified. After all, she's a **very** busy woman. I would know, given the fact that I had made that call at 3am last night.\n\n\"I'm sorry hun... I've got sudden last minute *stuff* to settle, I'll be back by 12.\" I forced myself to crack open my eyes again, contemplating if I should have asked for a later time.\n\n\"Oh... It's always business I suppose. We can go to the Eiffel in the afternoon right?\" Adding a particular tinge of sadness at the end of that sentence, I often feel like we are just 2 actors on a stage, playing our roles as husband and wife. It's comical almost, like the set-up of some late-night romcom.\n\n\"Yeah. Hopefully...\" She glances at her phone nervously, although shielding it with a veneer of urgency. \n\nI will say: She's a pretty good actor.\n\n\"Eric just sent me the venue, it's pretty close by to the tower... I can meet you there if my meeting doesn't overrun.\" Resisting the temptation to say \"I know\", I put on a face of placid acceptance. \n\n\"Sure! Sounds great! Just uh... Text me once you're done I guess.\" \n\nHer eyes suddenly narrowed as she scrolled down on her phone. \"Alright, I've got to rush out now... Again, I'm sorry. I know-\n\nI pushed myself upright. \"Shush shush, you don't need to apologise. Now scram, we wouldn't want you to be late for your *meeting* right?\" Giving a playful wink, I settled into the knowledge that my work began the moment her work did.\n\n\"Alright.\" She draped a beautiful black leather coat over her shoulders. I didn't even noticed she had changed out already. \"Love you hun!\" I chimed cheerfully.\n\n\"Love you too honey!\" She walked with a particular urgency out the hotel door, footsteps getting quieter and quieter with each step.\n\n\"All the world's a stage...\" I whispered to noone in particular.\n\nLazily, I picked myself up from bed. My own alias was fashioned to be a perfect fit with Eliza's. An aspiring writer, one who always has an excuse to take his laptop with him wherever he goes... And wherever his wife goes...\n\nI cracked open my laptop, typing in the alternate set of credentials that distinguished me from George the writer, to Avery the handler. A part of me knows that a handler shouldn't have any emotional attachment to their assassin. \n\nBut at the same time, I wish I could just put away the acting masks for a minute, and be honest with her...\n\nBut that would get both of us killed. \n\nToday... *Our* 'meeting's client' happens to be a Parisian bar owner with a... Let's say 'concerning' amount of explosives in his basement. \n\nChecking the GPS tracker... Eliza's still here?\n\nFootsteps rang from outside the door. \n\nOh shit.\n\nThe door opens...\n\n\"Hey Liza! I think you forgot this!\" I held up her company lanyard.\n\n\"Oh my goodness George, you are a lifesaver. I can't believe I forgot that!\" She reaches over to grab it from my hands. \n\n\"Business is always busy. See ya!\" I said, as she rushed out the door again. \n\nI checked my laptop again. She was on her way down the street already. \n\nAnother day, another 'client' settled. That's what happens when business is booming I suppose...",

            "comment": "Maria, you have always been beautiful to me. I like the scar running across your face, jagged and white. I like the unique huskiness of your voice from your damaged vocal chords. I like the silhouette of your melancholic beauty veiled against a moonlit balcony from the very first time we met in person. \n\nAh, back when you were contracted to kill me. You never realized my true identity back then, of course. You had no idea at all that I\u2019d usurped the position of your handler. I thought I would just use you to investigate your associates and to discover who was after my head. I thought I didn\u2019t need to tell you because you were meant to be nothing but a tool. \n\nSome people might say it\u2019s immoral, the way we\u2019re living now. You, working in black ops for the sake of a country that doesn\u2019t love you. I, working in a false identity for a country I don\u2019t believe in. Two idiots living in hypocrisy and sin, playing pretend and denying our true selves so that this farcical play can go on without reaching its closing act. \n\nI say, I\u2019m a happy man. \n\nMaria\u2026you\u2019ll always be beautiful to me, whether you are dressed in that pure white wedding dress or stained with rust and grime. You should never feel ashamed of yourself or of the secrets that you feel you are hiding from me. You\u2019ll always be beautiful, even if the last I see of you is your steely eyes behind the sight of a gun barrel. \n\nSo I am willing to continue this charade, forsaking my comrades and their dream to bring down this corrupt country. I am willing to stay by your side, extinguishing my true self to bask in your presence. I will never, ever reveal that I am the one who is passing down your orders. If anyone tries to reveal this secret\u2026well, you\u2019re not the only one who has been getting their hands dirty. \n\nMaria, I hope you never have to see this letter, but if you do\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m sorry I could never tell you all this myself, even though I never will.",

She lives just down the block, you know. \n\nMaria\u2026ah, she\u2019s a business woman, always taking trips overseas and rarely spending time at home. You\u2019ll recognize her immediately if you see her, poor dear, she has a scar on her face from a car accident, her husband told me. I\u2019m not too sure what kind of business she\u2019s in, but it\u2019s probably doing really well although she must be dreadfully busy. I often see her husband out shopping for new clothes for her. \n\nHer husband? Oh, he\u2019s a rather lovely lad, that one. You\u2019ll see him out on the village green during market days selling his plants. He\u2019s a horticulturalist by trade, grows all sorts of flowers in that greenhouse behind their home. A rather stern and polite young man although he\u2019s also a very, ahem, dishy looking lad at that, though you didn\u2019t hear that from this old woman, haha. Very loyal to his wife though, you\u2019ll never see him even spare a glance at those village girls hanging around his stall. \n\nHow long have they lived here? Not all that long I think. Uh, let me see, yes, they\u2019ve been here for nine months now. They came from\u2026from\u2026huh, I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ve ever mentioned much about where they were from at all. Odd, I\u2019ve never thought about it before\u2026I\u2019m sure I must have asked before\u2026 \n\n\u2026oh? You wanted to visit them? I don\u2019t know\u2026they quite like their privacy. \n\n\u2026you\u2019re an old friend of theirs\u2019? Lawrence\u2019s ex-colleague? Well, I- I suppose I could help you out since you\u2019ve been nice enough to listen to an old lady ramble on for so long. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be happy to see you\u2026",

            "comment": "I had barely set her coffee down when the call came in.\n\nWith orchestrated nonchalance I watched her make a face which said *this again*? When she glanced down at the buzzing phone I saw an imperceptible tightening of the jaw, a miniscule drawing of the lips.\n\n\u201cSorry hon, it\u2019s work.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a weekend, really?\u201d I protested, hands cupped around my own mug. \u201cWe were going to head to the nursery and look at wisteria.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d She was already up and moving, planting a peck on my cheek by way of apology. \u201cHopefully it\u2019ll be something quick.\u201d\n\nI watched her leave, moving with the purpose and poise that meant a new job had come in. Already the neurons were firing, calculating distance, equipment needs, alias appropriation, and methods of neutralisation. None of these things she would need if she were going to her 'job' in accountancy. But for her *actual job*\u2026\n\nIt was almost comical watching this perfect killing machine squeeze into our years-old second-hand hatchback, keys pressed between her lips, hair in a mess. She\u2019d swap the vehicle in for something faster and sleeker on the way, have a new hair colour in hours, and maybe some prosthetics to top it all off.\n\nHow did I know all this? I\u2019d made the call.\n\nI watched the car disappear down the street with a sad smile. I had known since 5AM we wouldn\u2019t be going to look at wisteria.\n\nWe had a broken home intruder alarm system by the front door. I\u2019d been promising to have the thing fixed for years, but never got around to it. Mostly because, with the right combination of inputs\u2026\n\nA heavy clunk sounded from the basement, where I knew a hidden compartment had slid open. I descended the stairs into a room which served as both utility room and impromptu communications hub.\n\nThere, slipped between the washer/dryer and a rusting metal sink, were half a dozen widescreen monitors buzzing with information. I settled into a fold-out chair I kept as cover, and swiped into life the brief on her latest target.\n\nSomewhere in the city, someone was about to have a very bad day. I\u2019d had my own notification before dawn, and slipped out of bed on the pretence of wanting to watch some European soccer.\n\nI yawned, fingers settling into a familiar rhythm. I knew a companion console would be flipped into action on the dash of our little car, delivering all the information I gathered for her from the depths of the agency\u2019s files. \n\nI grabbed a lanyard from its hook, scanning the badge code to gain access to files even the White House assumed were \u201coff the books\u201d. It had a very official-looking photo of me from back in the day, all clean-shaven and square-jawed.\n\nA different time, a different life. Before I\u2019d met her, and before things had become so complicated.\n\nThey say couples shouldn\u2019t have secrets from each other, but when those secrets prevent nuclear warfare then perhaps some exceptions can be made. Yet that morning I had forgotten one key piece of kit. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep, but I hadn\u2019t activated the GPS tracker.\n\nA knock on the basement door, loud and clear.\n\n\u201cHon? Are you down there?\u201d\n\n*Shit.*\n\nWhere was the kill-switch? I fumbled, knocking the now-lukewarm coffee onto my lap. I could hear the doorknob turning. What was the code? Her birthday? No, that was my Netflix password. Our wedding date? Nope.\n\nI remembered just as the door opened, flooding the basement with daylight. The console slipped away, the wall snapping close with a *clunk*.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I managed in the most nonchalant voice possible. \u201cWhat happened to work?\u201d\n\nShe took a few steps down the stairs. I noted with small satisfaction that she had also been a little careless \u2013 her pumps exchanged for combat boots. I said nothing.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing down here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, err-\u201d\n\nThe coffee! I shrugged and pointed to my moist lap.\n\n\u201cSpilled damn coffee on myself, was coming down here to wash it off.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound convinced. \u201cHave you seen my handbag? I got halfway across town before I realised I\u2019d left it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s on the coat rack by the door,\u201d I said, slipping out of my ruined sweatpants.\n\n\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll head out then, love you sweetheart!\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you too,\u201d I grinned, ignoring the impression left by the bandolier under her sport coat.\n\nThe front door closed, leaving me in sheepish silence. I sighed, and tossed the pants onto the dryer. Something flashed in the light of the still-open basement door.\n\nI\u2019d forgotten to take off my lanyard.",

I knew there had been some *complications* yet I couldn't let my own voice transpire the knowledge of the situation. I quickly flicked some switches and turned on a cafe background sound that quickly filled the small dark room with sounds of laughter and joy. The conversation was quick and sweet,  as always, she was locked in trafic she said, wouldn't be able to come in time so, I should treat myself and she told me not to forget to take my daughter at four to the piano lessons then quickly ended her call with a kiss goodbye.\n\n\nThe muffled sound of distant gunfire and explosions could be still be heard through the wide band pass filter, the sound designers did a spoty job masking the background war sounds, to a trained ear that is, but who could have know if it wasn't me? Anyone else would have hard time even hearing the imperceptible inflections of her voice. I knew her, better than anyone, better than herself, she was my life and my world, my angel of death and love. She was my operative and my wife, my masterpiece and my confident. She had brought to life the best gift a man would ever want. That of parenthood. It was for *her* that we fought, for *her* that we pressed ever onwards, keeping the fragile equilibrium of our broken world. To help build a better one for those after.\n\nAfter a quick kiss throught the line and a final love you. Our expression became the real ones, Those of focus and commitment, as a handler, my job was to provide tactical and immediate Intel to our operatives, and she was the most important one of all. I still had a few hours before it was time to get my kid from school, and a few more to get my operative back from that forsaken war.",

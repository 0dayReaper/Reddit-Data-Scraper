            "comment": "\"Next!\" shouted Lugia.\n\nThree rows of chairs sat before him, each holding a potential recruit into their league. He could tell at a glance what a few of the powers before him were; the man on fire and the woman floating two inches above her chair were gimmes. A few of the others, like the woman with the glowing eyes and the man with the power armour, would be interesting to find out, but most of the candidates looked like perfectly normal people. One of the inconspicuous ones stepped forward next; unlike the others, he had a frown on his face.\n\n\"Your name, sir?\" Lugia inquired.\n\n\"My name? I'm Bill.\" the man responded.\n\n\"And what will be your superhero name?\" Lugia continued, with a flare for the dramatic. He had always been something of a performer, and gaining powers had given him the perfect opportunity to overact (as he had always desired).\n\n\"I don't have one,\" was the response. \"Look, can I,\" he began, before Lugia cut him off.\n\n\"No name? Then we will have the honour of naming you! Tell us good sir, what is your power?\" Lugia had loved naming new capes ever since he screwed up his own choice so badly.\n\n\"Every time that guy stops time,\" he began, pointing at Destiny, \"my time stops as well. It's become a serious issue, alright?\"\n\nLugia looked over at Destiny, who had a puzzled look on his face. A moment later, both Destiny and \"Bill\" had changed their standing positions. Destiny looked intrigued, but Bill's annoyed look had only strengthened, if possible.\n\n\"Amazing!\" cried Lugia. The possibilities of this were endless. \"Can you copy the powers of anyone else?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not on fire, so I'm guessing no,\" replied Bill, looking wearily at his neighbour in the crowd.\n\n\"Hmm, well, it's not the strongest power in existence, but we could certainly find a use for it...\" Lugia mused.\n\n\"What? No, I have no interest in using it. I would just like some warning when it's about to happen. The sixth time it happened, the bike I was pedalling stopped, throwing me over the handlebars. I was bruised for weeks. Imagine if I had been driving! Or taking a train. I'd be dead! By the way, fire your secretary, she called me a crank when I phoned her up. I had to walk over here to get an audience!\"",

MC has the typical weak body born with no quirk and builds up with each episode. The animation is top-notch. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s as good as animated movies with higher budgets but it\u2019s definitely up to standard relative to other anime\u2019s. Honestly I think you should give it a try. The OST is pretty amazing and compliments each scenes well. \nOne thing I didn\u2019t really enjoy about BnHA, however is the cringey-ness of the show\u2019s back story. Of course, that\u2019s my personal opinion because I\u2019m not a fan of \u2018everyone\u2019s a hero\u2019 type of anime. Other than that, I still enjoyed the anime nonetheless and would definitely recommend it.",

            "comment": "My sneakers tapped gently against the pavement as I walked briskly down the street. I squeezed my way through the peak-hour human traffic, catching whiffs of overly-strong perfume and worse, overly-strong body odor. I don\u2019t like people much. I mean that in the nicest way possible. Two\u2019s company, three\u2019s a crowd, anything more than that is a nightmare. Trying to ignore the occasional sweaty body that rubbed too close against mine as I wormed through the crowd, I wished that everyone would just *stop moving*. \n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, they did. The sounds of shoes pattering against the pavement and car horns blaring as frustrated drivers crawled through stand-still traffic disappeared into thin air, as if they\u2019d never been there. A perfect, fragile silence descended upon the world. Every single person, object and animal was frozen. The fat man in a shirt clearly too small for him had stopped, his pudgy leg stretched out mid-stride. A teenage girl with highlights in her hair swept aside her fringe with one hand, the other raised in mid-air in an attempt to adjust her earphones. A flock of pigeons hung artificially in the air, like some sort of elaborate piece of abstract art dangling from the ceiling of a museum. \n\nYet even as the world froze around me, I continued moving. In that heartbeat when everything else was locked in time, my left foot landed solidly on the ground, and unconsciously, my right foot had moved forwards, about to take another step. Then I stopped. Nothing compelled me to, not like *something* seemed to compel everything and everyone else to stop, no. I just stood there, in shock and awe. Had my \u2018wish\u2019 caused this to happen? What was going on? And yet, even as my thoughts became a jumbled mess, I couldn\u2019t help but smile. Moving around was *so* much easier with everyone stopped in place. \n\nAs it turns out, no, I wasn\u2019t the one who caused that to happen. Time abruptly resumed a short while later, as if nothing at all had transpired. By then, I was out of the crowd, tucked away in the corner of a quiet caf\u00e9. I only noticed when the barista started to move again, the sound of beans being crushed in a grinder giving me the shock of my life. \n\nThe freezes happened over and over again, at random intervals. They never lasted very long, but I definitely wasn\u2019t the one doing it. In fact, as the phenomenon occurred more and more, I *knew* for sure that someone else was stopping time. There\u2019s no good way to explain it, but I could *feel* their presence, somewhere, not too close, but not too far away. I didn\u2019t know if they could sense me too, the way I could sense them, but I knew that they were out there. So far, I hadn\u2019t seen anything or anyone else move during those freezes. \n\nIt may sound stupid now, but I was content to enjoy those little moments while they lasted. It usually wasn\u2019t inconvenient, and it led to some really cool opportunities to prank my friends, or to escape from throngs of people in a busy mall. I knew that my \u2018partner-in-crime\u2019 was out there, but I had no desire to find them. In hindsight, that was a mistake. \n\nMy sneakers tapped gently against the pavement as I walked briskly against the street. It was a day much like the one when I had first experienced the peculiar sensation of being the only sentient person in a world of frozen time. Once again, I squeezed through the peak-hour human traffic. Once again, my senses were bombarded by a host of things I hated dealing with. And once again, not unlike many of the other times, I quietly wished that my time-stopping partner might decide to freeze time once more, to allow me to slip out from this nightmare. \n\nSurprisingly enough, time stopped. It wasn\u2019t often that time stopped at a convenient juncture, so I took the opportunity to dash out of the sticky- literally- situation that I\u2019d found myself enclosed in. And yet, as I took in a gulp of fresh air, something felt wrong. \n\nIt took me a moment to realize what it was. I was having trouble sensing the time-stopper. It wasn\u2019t like the first time, when I just wasn\u2019t aware of them, no. It was as if they were\u2026 fading away. Like the dying flame of a candle, about to wink out of existence. \n\nBelatedly, I wondered what\u2019d happen to me if they vanished while the world was frozen. \n\nWe always think of the important things just a little too late. I felt that pulse from the time-stopper grow weaker and weaker, slowly dissipating like a fine dust floating into the atmosphere. I prayed that time would resume, that everything would go back to normal. \n\nAnd yet, that perfect, fragile silence remained intact. Every single person, object and animal was still frozen. The random passers-by were all stuck in time, locked in place, halfway through their last action before the world had decided to stop. A flock of crows hung artificially in the air, like some sort of elaborate piece of abstract art dangling from the ceiling of a museum.\n\nI screamed, my voice ricocheting and echoing off the tall buildings that surrounded me. \n\nBut no response came. \n\n*****\n \n*more stories at /r/chasing_mist*\n\n*I write a story a day [here](http://yearofpilgrimage.wordpress.com)*\n",

Falls in love with one of his teachers so he decides to freeze time long enough for him to be old enough to be with her. He decides to freeze it when meeting her but stammers the word because of the emotion when he sees her and he doesn't realize that doing so accelerated his aging while time was stopped By the time he figures it out, he is already on the verge of being an old man, decides to ask that teacher for help. By the time he reaches her, he is nearly dead. She asks him for the word, so that she can try and stop time or do something, he says it, it stops time and freezes her with it and he dies...\nThat story really messed with my sense of comfort.",

            "comment": "21st of May, 2023\n\nIt's been almost three months since we somehow managed to catch the legendary time freeze killer, and we've gotten nowhere figuring out how his powers work.\n\nThe fact that we managed to catch him in the first place seemed so weird. He just popped up in the middle of a bank vault and was quickly overpowered and detained. My only explanation is that there must be some kind of limit to his ability to stop time, or rather that he doesn't have full control of the ability. The trophies he kept on his person of his victims confirmed his guilt of the double murder one month prior.\n\nIt's clear that his sanity is quickly deteriorating in captivity. His control is getting worse, it seems. We've kept him in an as secure cell as we can, but several times he has almost managed to break out, only for him to pop up right in front of a guard. He is getting more and more paranoid, repeatedly screaming about murdering someone. We can't examine him properly, but everything points to the man he always talks about being another personality of his.\n\nLately, as his control weakens, his powers seem to have turned into a curse. Some mornings we find him severely dehydrated lying on the floor with his hands covered in dried blood, with bloodied dents and marks left on the cell door. I can't help but feel sorry for him, on the verge of death every other day and constant self-inflicted injuries. Even a man that brutally killed a woman and her son can't deserve this kind of torture. It's clear that he, at least now, is severely mentally ill, but we can't risk doing most medical examinations, nor are we able to communicate with him when he is being so uncooperative.\n\nIn the end, we can simply keep containing him and study the little information we have.\n\nPS: One of the prison guards seem to have an unhealthy obsession with the prisoner. I've caught him smiling while listening to the prison staff gossiping about the prisoner when he thinks nobody sees him. I have a bad feeling about him. I recommend that the guard is reassigned before he gets a chance to cause trouble.\n",

            "comment": "The time stops.  The first time it had happened was months ago, and only for a few shocking seconds.  I remember being afraid I'd had a stroke or something, but I never got it checked out.  How do you tell a doctor that one second you're eating lunch and then nothing moves but you?\n\nThe second time was maybe five minutes.  I panicked when it started, but once I realized I was in control of myself and didn't seem like anything was wrong, it started seeming less terrifying.  I admit, I did a few things I shouldn't have.  Took advantage of the situation.  A few dropped pants and tied shoes, nothing worse than that.  Not like I could do anything more elaborate anyway, since I never knew when the time stops were coming or how long they'd last.\n\nI knew somehow instinctively that I wasn't making time stop.  Once I figured that out, I felt a little disappointed, but it didn't bother me ultimately.  Whoever it was didn't do a time stop very often, and they didn't manage to get me when the time was wrong, so it didn't bother me much.  That is, until today.  Or would it be more accurate to say three \"days\" ago?\n\nThe time stops started picking up frequency over the last few weeks.  Once a day, then twice a day, sometimes three or four.  Fifteen minute stretches, thirty minutes.  The longest one was about three hours.  Inconvenient at best and downright boring at worst.  It was always in the back of my head that I should find out who was doing this and give them a talking-to.  Did they know whatever they were doing didn't affect me?  Were they playing a prank on me or something?  But every time I'd gotten to the point where I was just fed up enough to try, time would pop back into reality and I'd eventually forget the frustration.\n\nExcept for this one.  After six hours had stretched on with no end in sight, I decided it was time to make good on my threats.  It took a bit of calming down and being focused, but I finally felt an odd feeling, like a compass needle pointing me in a direction.  Since time hadn't returned, I followed it.  Not like I have anything better to do.\n\nI was on day three when I found the room.\n\nA woman lay in a hospital bed, tubes sprouting from seemingly everywhere around her.  To her right, a doctor stood, his hand poised over a silent machine.  And to her left, a man sat in an uncomfortable-looking chair.  His right hand rested on the woman's forehead, gently brushing her hair from her face with his thumb.  His left hand's fingers intertwined with hers, their gold rings tapping against each other.  And his head was downturned, staring at the floor,  until the sound of my footsteps made one haggard eye raise up over his outstretched left arm.\n\nWe looked at each other in silence for a moment, then he looked away, his hand resuming stroking her hair.  He looked like shit.  Like he'd been crying for three days straight.\n\nI stood still for a moment, then simply brought a chair from another room and sat down quietly next to him.  He didn't acknowledge me.  I could see his chest heaving again with silent, pained sobs.\n\nAnd time stretched on.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nFirst time posting here.  Prompt lodged a scene in my head and I knew better than to ignore it.  Just wrote it and did barely any editing before posting, so please be kind to me!  I haven't written anything more or less since my degree burned away all my desire to write, lol.",

            "comment": "I stand, leaning against her. Ever leaning against her. I have been doing so as long as I can remember. She's behind me. And I've got my back against her. My legs dug in, pushing futile against her. My legs used to ache, I think. Perhaps I only imagined it and then later forgot it was only imagining. Either way, they didn't ache now. They didn't anything now. Except push. They pushed my back against her.\n\nShe was silent, for her part. Everything was silent. The little bird was silent. The squirrels. The people. Dozens of people around us. So resolute in their silence. I'm silent too, mostly. I remember making a noise. That I do remember. Because when I made the noise, it seemed so loud my ears hurt afterwards. So I don't make any noise either.\n\nShe's still. So still. But I push. I always push. She doesn't move. The wrinkle in her coat sticks into my back. It used to hurt. But I pushed anyway. Her jacket was soft. Soft was when you touched and it moved. But she doesn't move. I push, and she's still there.\n\nBeside us is the thing. The thing is ready to move. I remember that. It's got a person in it. They have a surprised look on their face. Their hands off the wheel part of the thing, trapped halfway to covering their stupid surprised face. Their stupid hair, and their stupid mole. The stupid dribble of whatever they had been putting in their stupid mouth. The stupid thing they were holding, stupidly glowing.\n\nI don't like the thing, or the person in it.\n\nThen a pain. Terrible flashing pain. Again. Again. Again. Again.\n\nNo. Not pain. Sound. A sound. Maybe both? Again. Not sure. Again. More pain. The pain was getting closer.\n\nI remember this pain. Steps. Footsteps.\n\nAnd for the first time, I see something move.\n\nHe walked around a corner, making humming noises to himself. I pushed.\n\nHe's walking by me. Doesn't look at me. I don't make a sound. I don't move. I push. I look like the rest of it. I want him to look at me.\n\nI try to call out, but only a faint hoarseness sounds through my long unused neck. I need to breath in. I had forgotten. It had been so long since I'd bothered. I'd forgotten.\n\nIt was enough.\n\nHe started and stopped, looking for the sound. My sound. I push. I take a moment, and figure out how to draw the air inside me. I remember. Still just hoarseness, but louder. Painfully loud. A screaming whisper of loud.\n\n*\"wait\"*\n\n\"You're awake? How are you awake? You're not supposed to be awake.\" The man is too loud. I push. But I remember his noises.\n\n*\"I had to stop the thing\"*\n\nThe man looks from me to the thing. The thing is close to me. The thing is close to her. I push.\n\n\"You're pushing her out of the way of the car.\"\n\nYes, I push. He doesn't await a reply.\n\n\"How long have you been awake?\"\n\nThis time he waits.\n\nBreath in. I push.\n\n*\"forever\"*\n\nThe man looks sad. The thing is waiting. Has always been waiting. The stupid person in the thing looks on with their stupid surprise.\n\n\"I didn't know someone was awake. If... had I known...\"\n\nThe man stammers. I push. The man approaches. And reaches out to me. He touches my arm. Pain. Different than the sound pain. The man pulls his hand back. The arm is dented. A torn ruin where his fingers landed. I push.\n\n\"It's too close for you. But her... I'll help you.\"\n\nThe man walks around the thing, and puts his hands around her. I push.\n\n\"I am sorry, young man. I truly didn't know.\"\n\nI push.\n\n\"Ready yourself.\"\n\nI push.\n\nAnd the thing moves.",

            "comment": "At first I thought it was some sort of \"dormant powers coming to light\" kind of situation. I'd record what I was doing just before time froze and then try to recreate it to see if it could happen again. This eventually got worse as I would try to recreate hours, and then days at a time. Thankfully I realized that it wasn't anything I was doing and managed to stop myself before it became an obsession.\n\nNowadays I try to go with the flow whenever the Pauses occur. Sometimes its a couple of seconds, which only serves to have me trip over something that's suddenly stopped in front of me. Other times it's been upwards of three hours before things resumed and, during those Pauses, I try to get errands done that don't require some sort of live or active interactions. I can't play games online since the servers freeze, but I can go and grab groceries. Before you crucify me for being a thief, I've made it a habit to leave some cash behind for whatever I take. It may not be the FULL amount, but I aim for 75% at least.\n\nI've tried finding out who it is that Pauses everything, but I haven't had any luck. There hasn't been anything on the news about miracles happening around the world, aside from the usual fluff pieces, and there haven't been any segments about rampant or elaborate crimes. Far as I've figured? Whoever it is that's causing these Pauses is just using them to make life a bit easier for themselves somehow. No need for me to go on some crusade to hunt them down when they haven't done anything to deserve it.",

            "comment": "Ok...... This is weird. Everybody else has stopped moving again. But there's no way I did it. Somebody else did this. I look around trying to figure out if someone else is moving. Around me people have paused driving, walking, whatever they had been doing. I walk around them looking for any sign that they're awake, but nobody blinks when I try to wake them. Huh..... ok. This is different then the first couple of times.\n\nAt first I didn't notice it. When it happened it only lasted around three seconds. I always kept my head down in school so I didn't know everybody else has stopped. Then one day I put my head up and noticed. It was great. After I freaked out for a bit I began pranking the bullies. They'd \"Wake\" attached to the flag pole, or with their head in a toilet. I thought it was amazing. I thought it was me. I can tell now I was wrong.\n\nThis is the longest they've ever been frozen. It's been about 30 minutes now and I haven't found anyone moving. Hell, they might not even be from around here. I walk around the sidewalk towards my apartment where a dogs frozen taking a crap on the lawn. I snort and press against the door. It takes a little but I'm able to force it open. \n\nI walk up the stairs past Mrs. O'Leary, She's frozen with her mouth open screaming at another tenant who was just trying to go back into their apartment. I grab Mrs. O'Leary and take her outside of the already open door. I make myself laugh as I set her down in the dog poop. Then walk back inside.\n\nIt's weird not hearing the creaks as I walk up the stairs. When I move in this state I don't leave a trace. I can't be heard, I guess because time is frozen on objects. That's why I have to press as hard as I can to get a freaking door open. I walk into my \"closet\" otherwise known as an apartment. It's alright. I've got a room, a couch, a kitchen, and a bathroom. They just all happen to be in the same room.\n\nI sigh and grab a soda from the fridge. I head to the couch but the sight of my laptop open stops me. I could have sworn I closed it when I left. I look around the room and lock the door, then I sit down on the couch. I look at the computer but don't try to turn it on. It wont work until time has restarted. \n\nA minute later I can hear the birds chirping outside, people honking at each other, Mrs. O'Leary screaming at the dog who's poop she just landed it. The laptop turns on and a video loads. It's of my apartment. I hesitantly press the button. For a second nothing happens. Then a woman appears. \n\n\"Hey little brother..... we need to talk.\"\n\nI hear the door open behind me. The one I just locked.\n",

Everybody else has stopped moving again. Except this time I'm confident I didn't do it. I look around the street trying to find anyone else moving. Anyone else who's... well I like to call it \"Awake.\" I walk past people who have paused driving, walking, whatever they happened to be doing, no one's awake though. I sigh and turn myself around continuing the walk to my apartment. \n\nAt first I didn't notice it when time stopped. It only happened three seconds at a time. I always kept my head down at school so when they stopped I just kept walking. Then I looked up. It was great. Of course after I stopped freaking out for a bit I started pranking the bullies. It was hard of course. I learned that with time frozen everything besides myself became hard to move. I guess because they're frozen it takes a lot of time to move them. I had to settle for giving bullies wedgies and tying their shoes together, always hoping they wouldn't wake when I did it.\n\nIt's been 5 years since they started and they've never lasted any longer than ten minutes at a time. The one that's happening now has lasted longer than thirty minutes. I walk around the sidewalk to my apartment complex where a dogs taking a crap on the lawn. I snort and press against the door. It takes me about a minute to get it open.\n\nI walk up the stairs past Mrs. O'Leary, she's frozen with her mouth open screaming at another tenant who was probably just trying to get back to their apartment. With a grin I come up with a plan.\n\nThirty minutes later I've finally dragged her into the dogs crap downstairs. Chuckling to myself I walked back inside. The stairs don't make a noise as I walk up them, it's almost like I'm a phantom. I don't leave a trace. \n\nI shove my door open and look at my closet of an apartment. It's nice enough with a couch, a kitchen, and a bathroom. They just all happen to be in the same room. I sigh setting my bag by the door and opening the fridge with effort. \n\nLunchables in hand I head to the couch but stop before I can sit down. My laptop is open on the table. I know I closed it before I left. I look around the room, but nothing else has moved.... still I lock the door just in case.\n\nI sit down and stare at the lap top. It won't work until time has restarted.\n\nA minute later I can hear the birds chirping outside, people honking at each other, Mrs. O'Leary screaming at the dog poop she just landed in. The laptop turns on and a video loads. I've never seen it before. Meaning someone way stronger than me was up here during the time freeze. I click the play button.\n\nFor a second nothing happens. Then a woman appears. One i haven't seen in years.\n\n\"Hey little brother........we need to talk.\"\n\nI hear the door open behind me. The one I just locked.\n\nPart 2 coming soon\n",

Your ability to \"see\" would basically be from some of the \"coldest\" photons in the universe sped up to the point they become visible light in your frame.\n \nWalking through air would be like trying to run through molasses (or worse), and breathing would be no different (whether or not \"frozen\" oxygen incorporated into your body would behave normally or not is an entire *textbook* on human metabolism).\n\nNormally solid objects like doors would be totally immovable (the attempt would utterly destroy them, and going back to the \"healing\" thing, you would take similar damage - Imagine firing a bazooka through a door, and you're the bullet - That's about what it would be like).  Something like water *might* behave like the GP describes doors - Push hard enough and you can move it out of your way (a rain storm would be a real PITA).\n\nOh, and everyone around you would die, because you'd be emitting a high-energy gamma burst in every direction you moved... Basically, your entire path would be a nuclear blast expanding outward at the speed of light.  This goes back to the need for superhuman radiation resistance.\n \nThe only way around (most of) this would be if your \"power\" is more of a bubble around you allowing you (and everything else inside) to operate normally.  And even that has it's problems - For example, your \"bubble\" would almost instantly become a hard vacuum (air could get out but not in, unless you move - And that would apply to light, too, you'd basically only be able to see in a direction you're moving toward).",

Nopeeeeeee..... No way you're not real. Everything's finally gotten to me. I knew it, I am totally insane.\"\n\nI turn towards the singular window in my apartment and close my eyes. When I open them she won't be there anymore. \n\nI turn back around and sigh. \n\n\"You're still here. Which means either I am severely insane or I'm just gonna have to accept that your alive. Maybe both?\"\n\nMy sister snorts and sits down on my couch. She looks so different then the last time I saw her. Her hair that used to be blonde like mine is dyed purple, She has scars on her arms that I'd never seen before, they looked like something from an animal attack.....\n\n\"Where did you go Lila? You left me here with no one.\"\n\nLila looks up at me and motions for me to sit down. I do but slowly. I'm still not so comfortable with her being here.\n\n\"I had to leave Finn. I didn't have a choice..... once I started stopping time they came for me. The monsters.\"\n\nI would've laughed if I didn't see exactly how serious my sister was being. She was never like that when I knew her. I edged closer to her on the couch and grabbed her hand.\n\n\"They did this?\"\n\nShe nods grabbing her arm back and rubbing it carefully.\n\n\"Other things too......\"\n\nI nod my expression furious. She might have left but anything that could hurt my sister needed to die, and I promised myself the next thing to hurt her would.\n\nLila stood up and started walking in circles around the room as she talked.\n\n\"I found a place... one that could protect me. We have a brother there. You'd like him, he's much older than us though.\"\n\nI raise an eyebrow at my sister. We were orphans, raised by a foster family. Well more like six foster families. What were the chances we had another brother?\n\n\"I had to leave though.... I had to find you. I knew the monsters would come for you. I was just hoping you'd be able to escape it.\"\n\nI stand up and look out the windows quickly.\n\n\"What do you mean? The monsters are coming for me?\"\n\nLila nods. She stops walking and puts an arm around my shoulder, handing me what looked like a pocket watch.\n\n\"They've been waiting here for days, I hoped I could get you out before they got here. I was too late, so we're gonna have to fight our way out. Press the button on top.\"\n\nI look down at the pocket watch and role it around my fingers. It's cold to the touch, looks incredibly old. I almost hesitate to press the top button. I gently press it and I here a loud ding. The pocket watch morphs into a scythe. It almost fit's my hand perfectly as I grasp it.... it feels like it's humming.\n\nA screeching noise grabs my attention to the door where my sister sits with her finger to her mouth. She's holding a silver dagger in her hand. As scary as she might be she looks nervous.\n\n\"Li......\"\n\nSomething bursts through the door so quick that my eyes can barely keep after it. It looks like a massive dog as it pounces onto my sister. She screams as she stabs at it but it only seems to piss it off.\n\nI'm frozen in place. I've never been more scared in my life. \n\n\"Kill it.\"\n\nWhat? Who....\n\n\"Kill it boy!\"\n\nI swing with my scythe easily chopping off the head of the dog. It dissolves into a golden dust on top of my sister. I rush to her side as she gasps for air. Her stomach is torn open and I can tell she's bleeding out. \n\n\"I'm so sorry... I'm so so sorry.\"\n\nShe raises her hand and gently touches my chest, then she points to where her other hand lies. She's written something with her blood on the floor. \"CAMP... HALF....B\" The last word isn't complete it's just blood in it's place.\n\n\"Camp Half B....?\"\n\nI look back at my sister but she's stopped struggling. There's no more breath coming out of her. Jesus..... Oh god no..... NO. I scream with my sister in my arms at nothing. At everything.\n\n\"Do it boy.\"\n\nI pounce up and grab my scythe searching around the room.\n\n\"You know you can do it.... do not insult my legacy boy....\"\n\nI stop..... his legacy...... I look at the pocket watch. If I can stop time..... maybe I can go back to. I concentrate on the watch... it begins to glow bright silver. The room shakes uncontrollably. I scream.\n\nI'm back out on the street where I was earlier. When everything froze before. I start to run. I'm back at the apartment within ten minutes. I crash through the door and it lands on the ground without a sound. I look at my hands in surprise... couldn't do that before. I run past Mrs. O'Leary who's stuck in time yelling at the new tenant. \n\nI burst through the door to find my sister filming the video I'd seen only a couple of minutes ago. \n\n\"Finn?\"\n\nI jump over the couch and grab her hand showing her the pocket watch. \n\n\"We need to go. Now!\"\n\nI grab her arm and tear through the apartment building. We race past the lawn and stop. I remember exactly how fast the dog was we can't run. I look around and smile. We can drive though.\n\nI hotwire Mrs. O'Leary's car and hit the gas driving away from the apartment I'd been so used to living in. \n\n\"So....... where's Camp Half Blood?\"\n\nMy sister points east. Helpful. I explained to her twenty minutes ago what had happened and she was still a little shaken. \n\n\"Drive boy.... drive before they can stop you.\"\n\nI hit the gas and drive.. heading towards Long Island, New York.\n",

            "comment": "\"Ohshit-- Adam!!\"\n\n\nMy friend yelped in a panicked voice and lurches out to me like I was about to be hit by a train, or something. My body shook out of instinct and I shut my eyes tight and brace the impact to come.\n\n\n*bbbBbBbBbbbb*\n\n\nOf course, it never did. I have a guardian angel after all. That noise seems to rumble up from everywhere at once in the school cafeteria. I know what's happened, it's happened so many times before, yet I can't control it. After several internal moments pass, I carefully open my eyes. All the students and staff had come to a halt until I was the only one left moving. \n\n\nThe world had become a standstill, my playground. At least... that's what I had thought in the beginning, but when you don't have the remote for a time controlling power, you lose out on being able to do all the fun stuff. Of course, the first time I was scared shitless, I had freaked out thinking that the goddamn school bully-- Cain, beat me to death in the hallway. I had carefully scattered away and retreated to the bathroom to try and decipher what the hell was happening. After a while, everything just went on like normal. \n\n\nA smile broke out on my expression as my reflection ended and I reach out to my delicious chocolate milk carton and take a slurp. Ahhh, freshman year sucked. My eyes shift around the scene and take in the information laid out before me. \"Now... what's happening?\"\n\n\nA high school cafeteria is like a friggin' zoo, man. All kinds of shit happening everywhere at once. The nerds sitting together playing yu-gi-oh with their boxed lunches, all the jocks arm wrestling in the corner to try and assert alpha male dominance, lots of stray students making their way to their respective tables. Everything looked all clear, though. So I'm not sure why she-- Oh. It wasn't until I turned around in my seat and spotted the big sloppy burger five inches from hitting the back of my head. Tracing the trajectory back, I find the culprit. Of fucking course, it's Cain. Who else would be such a relentless douche bag? \n\n\nNow, this is where you'd fight back against the bully!! I can't do that. I swore an oath to be careful until we figure out all the rules and limits. I take a deep breath and adjust my head slightly to the left, trying to make it look like I dodged the projectile in real time with my super spidey senses. \n\n\nThat's when I got an idea. \n\n\nI take one last look around, and notice none of the staff are looking this way. I look back to the woman approaching our table and bite my lip. I dash up out of my seat and run over to the nearest teacher, carefully adjusting their body so that they had gazed upon the crime scene. How much time was left? Well, none-- obviously, but you get the point!  I quickly turn on my heels and jump over one of the tables-- knocking all of the trays down on the ground while screaming out;\n\n\n\"ZAAAAA WARRRUUUDDOOOO~~!\" I've always wanted to do that.\n\n\nTurns out I ended up sitting there like an idiot for another minute or so, slightly tilted to the left until everything resumed like normal in the blink of an eye. A triumphant cry from over by the jocks signaling the return of time. The burger flew by and landed on the floor just beyond the table and the fucker jumped up from his seat.\n\n\n\"WHAT. HOW?!\" he cried out.\n\n\nEveryone looked at me in shock, my friend's hand gripped my collar in an attempt to pull me away. I noticed the teacher look over to the bully with a stern expression. Gottem. \n\n\nThat's when I looked to Evelyn, the girl making her way over to our table and smiled at her, as if nothing had happened.\n\n\n\"Thanks, again.\" I said.\n\n\n\"AnyTIME,\" she replied, wiggling her eyebrows.\n\n-----------------------\n\n((Hey guys! First time ever doing something like this, so plz be nice ; _ ; ))\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "I was seven the first time it happened.  The teacher was in the middle of having us recite our multiplication tables. I was daydreaming, staring absentmindedly into space while the sun shining through the windows lulled me into a pleasant state of drowsiness. It took a few seconds for me to realize the monotone drone of numbers had stopped, leaving nothing but silence.\n\nI rubbed the sleep from my eyes and looked around. All my friends were frozen - Tom over there with his glasses falling off the bridge of his nose, Abigail's eyes mid-blink. Before I could react, everything snapped back into motion. They continued reciting as if they hadn't just been paralyzed, trapped in time. I was practically bouncing out of my chair, holding back a grin. I had powers! \n\nThat dream died quickly. Try as I might, I could never get time to stop or start at will; it seemed to do as it pleased. I tried rewinding it that one time I asked my crush out while hammered, fast-forwarding it at a high school recital; once I even tried to jump back a few years to the last time I saw my gran before the dementia set in. No go. Time, however was cooperative enough in stopping so I could watch the life leave her in the hospital bed at my own pace. Her veiny hands stayed curled around my own until the world started up again and her heart monitor flatlined.\n\nThe last time, I was on the subway home from work. The train car rolled to a halt in the station, hydraulics hissing, but the doors did not open. A quick glance at my watch - the second hand had stopped ticking. Dammit. Hopefully, it wouldn't be too long. I pulled out my phone to occupy myself for however long I would be stuck. A flash of movement caught my eye and my head snapped up. Noone else ever moved when the world stopped, ever. My eyes darted from person to person, each perfectly still. Was I imagining things? Had I gone mad? Was this all some twisted hallucination that was finally moving to the next level?\n\nMovement again, outside the car. I ran to the window, stumbling over my own feet, just to catch a glimpse of strawberry-blonde hair tucked into a knit cap disappearing into the crowd, nimbly darting around the mass of motionless commuters. I banged on the glass. \n\n\"Hey!\" I shouted. \"Hey-y!\" The stranger didn't respond or react in the slightest, just continuing to run off. I couldn't even tell if they heard me. The subway doors opened with a lurch and a few people glanced at me, gaze flicking up from their respective devices for a few seconds before steadfastly ignoring the crazy guy banging his fist against the window. Heat crept into my cheeks and I sat back down.\n\nI spent that night staring at the ceiling in the dark, agonizing. Who was that? Did someone else have this power, this influence over time? Could they teach me? Were they trying to meet me?\n\nThe next day, shadows deep under my eyes, I took the train back to the same station. It would have been faster to take a different route, but I had to know - I /had/ to. I stood on that platform for hours, looking for the same blonde hair, the same small figure. I was met with a sea of people, but none of them the one I was looking for. \n\nIt was nearing the end-of-day rush. Deflated, I readied myself to push onto the next homeward-bound train. It stopped abruptly at the platform, the screeching of the rail being cut off into absolute silence. \n\n\"Hi.\"\n\nI whirled around. Directly behind me stood a young man, about my age, with short-clipped strawberry blonde hair. His hospital scrubs peeked out from under his long black coat, hands shoved deep in the pockets. He shuffled his feet, reached up to push his glasses back up the bridge of his nose.\n\nI blinked. \"Tom?\"\n\nHe smiled, but his eyes were shaky. \"You remember me!\"\n\n\"Dude, it's been years! I haven't seen you since - what, high school?\" \n\n\"Well... Yeah, you haven't seen me.\"\n\n\"Wait, so, this -\" I gestured to the static people around me \"- is you? This is all you?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"So then, in elementary school - \"\n\n\"I kind of froze,\" he laughed, glancing off to the side. \"That was by accident and I didn't know what was going on. Everything just stopped, except... Except you. I thought I was crazy, so I never brought it up.\"\n\nI thought back to every instance time had stopped. Up until a certain point, they had been serendipitous - in the middle of an exam I would have bombed otherwise, just before the bus home from school took off. It was only after graduation that the pauses grew erratic, almost inconsiderate. Except -\n\n\"The hospital,\" I said. \"That was you?\"\n\nTom nodded. \"I dunno. It had been so long, and I felt kind of weird talking to you when you were there for - well - yeah. I thought it would be nice to give you some more time. I realized after that that was pretty stupid. I'm sorry.\"\n\nI clenched and unclench my fists a few times. \"It's... Fine. It's fine. But why are you coming to me now, if it was awkward then?\"\n\nHe looked down at his feet, face coloring pink. \n\n\"Holy shit,\" I said, the realization dawning on me. \"That's kind of sweet, actually.\"\n\n\"This is probably really weird -\" \n\n\" - no kidding - \"\n\n\"But, I mean, hey.\" He glanced up to meet my eyes and gave me a shy smile. \"You're the only other person who can move when the world stops, so... We could use that.\"\n\nI laughed. \"Buy me dinner first. Next Friday at eight?\"\n\n\"I'll be there,\" he promised. \"After all, I've got plenty of time.\"\n\n(bad pun didn't know how to end this sorry)",

There is absolutely nothing to stop me from getting what I\u2019ve wanted for so many years, and in a few minutes I\u2019ll have more money than I could ever imagine having all at once. I really should feel bad... but fuck you, Richard, and the rest of your bullshit management team. I\u2019m just taking what is owed; no big deal, right?\n\nAnnnddd looks like he\u2019s entering the girl\u2019s locker room... typical kid. Guess that gives me about 5 minutes tops. Sadly that means I don\u2019t have time to slap a few people around. Consider it my present to you idiots for being coworkers for so long. Now now, what was it again?... 52... 36... 126.... 7.... 12... and 85... *click* bingo.\n\nHave you ever seen such a beautiful sight? Money. Money everywhere. Ohhh and don\u2019t forget all those beautiful golden bars. I think it\u2019s time to go shopping, don\u2019t you? See, this place here has been a temptation of mine for the past 16 years I\u2019ve had to deal with being an employee of this shit hole. And look at me now!!!.... oh I\u2019m sorry. Almost forgot time is frozen. Better get a move on. Hmm, I\u2019ll take one of these... and some of these... ohhh and a bit of these. Can\u2019t forget these either.\n\nHow much time do I have left?.... wow this little shit. He\u2019s having the time of his life in that locker room. Guess I can get one or two slaps in...\n\nAlright alright. If my math is correct... that puts me at about 450 grand... annnddd now let\u2019s grab a few of these and well, well, well... looks like I\u2019ve got myself a solid half a million. Not too bad for 5 minutes of work. I\u2019d say now is a good time to leave. Looks like the kid thinks so too.\n\nOh yeah. FUCK YOU RICHARD. THIS IS FOR THAT 5 CENT \u201cRAISE!\u201d\n*SLAP* And that ladies and gentlemen is probably better than sex itself!! HA HA!\n\nAlright alright and now we\u2019re out of there. Just in time too.\n\n*As the doors close behind me, the world begins to rotate once more, birds singing, people chatting, cars moving and all is right again*\n\nWell, this would definitely be a lot easier if I had the control of this time warp bullshit... but I\u2019ll consider all this good enough. And of course god bless technology for making cameras too small to ever detect. Putting it on that little shit\u2019s backpack was the best idea I\u2019ve ever had since realizing what was going on with the time stops!! Damn I\u2019m a genius... Oh. I am DEFINITELY gonna have to talk with that kid though. I mean, sneaking into girl\u2019s locker rooms with his power?? There\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting my son abuse his powers like that!",

            "comment": "The first time it happens, I\u2019m saying, *no ketchup, please*, to the grease stained hot dog vendor on 50th, and the city goes silent. World\u2019s biggest statue garden, and me, just wanting lunch. I take two cautious steps away from that boxed grill, shiny silver reflecting blurred halos of city light, staring as big-eyed as a small town tourist before the horns crack and the world starts again.\n\nThe guy with my food goes, \u201cWhat gives, man? You want your dog or not?\u201d\n\nI say, \u201cNo ketchup, please,\u201d but he looks at the dog in the bun, no ketchup in sight, and wrinkles his big bushy eyebrows. \n\nIn the mirror at home, burping up mystery meat, I keep saying, *No ketchup, please.* Traffic is still busy outside. *No ketchup, please.* The lady in 4A is still arguing with her boyfriend or husband or drug dealer. I don\u2019t really know these people. *No ketchup, please.* But, in the mirror, I\u2019m still this soft lump of unshowered loser, time ticking on without me. \n\nThing is, it happens again later that night. When my ma, crackling nagging voice brought to you from some beach town in California, stops talking. This was in the middle of asking *when are you going to get a real job?* Just after the question *are you seeing anyone yet?* I\u2019m submitted to this caring, parental questionnaire every Friday at 9pm, regularly scheduled shame, my weekly life crisis, and the answers never change so I hardly listen any more. No, I still live in my shitty apartment. No, I haven\u2019t been to Morton\u2019s. No, I\u2019m not seeing anyone. Yes, I\u2019m still a lonely, jobless, nobody.\n\nWhen she stops talking, my heart jumps. I'm starting to think about my poor dead mother, lying on some hard bed, surrounded by kitsch beachy decor and a great view of the ocean, all made-up and dressed-up even though she probably hadn\u2019t left the hotel all day. \n\nBut the traffic is stopped. The baby in 4C isn't crying. The yappy dog isn't yapping. So, I'm thinking, she's probably not dead.\n\nTaking the only chance I'll ever get, all at once, I\u2019m yelling, \u201cFuck you mom!\u201d I\u2019m screaming, my throat half-confused, half-excited to be making such a ruckus, I\u2019m going, \u201cI\u2019m fucked up, Mom. I\u2019m a failure, Mom.\u201d\n\nIn one, big, pissed off breath, I say, \u201cYou\u2019re a miserable old woman and you ruined me.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s a normal kind of silence on the other line. The sniffling, buzzing silence. Someone lays hard on their car horn, brakes squealing, all punctuated by incoherent shouting. If I hadn\u2019t been so aware of the peace that stopped time brought, I\u2019d say it felt like time, the world, had frozen around me. But it really didn\u2019t feel that way at all. \n\n\u201cYou need to get out of that city,\u201d my mom\u2019s saying, stifling tears. \u201cIt\u2019s made you into some kind of monster.\u201d \n\nSo I did. \n\nTime stops nowhere I wanted time to stop. In the middle of traffic, already at a stand-still, nothing happening. People aren\u2019t cursing, or talking on the phone, or eating, or singing to their reflection. No one is dreaming of being anywhere else because time just...wasn\u2019t. It stops while I\u2019m in line for snacks at the convenience store, staring up again just as I\u2019m making my escape. Goods in hand, I slink to the back of the line and wait all over again. Inconvenient. It stops in the middle of a sad late-night last-call bar hookup. No one looks good that way, frozen like that. \n\nIt takes me the trip from New York to Colorado before I realise it\u2019s not me. I\u2019m not a masochist and, so far, time hasn\u2019t been on my side. Somewhere, in India or Spain, you're fucking with me. Or, more realistically, you're robbing banks or causing trouble and I'm just caught in the crossfire. A casualty of poor timing. \n\nI\u2019ll find you. I\u2019m on a plane to Italy now, someone\u2019s snoring grandpa (nonno, in Italian) taking up the middle armrest, and I\u2019ll look for you. I\u2019ve got a trust fund and all of the time in the world. I even showered, just for you. \n\nSee you soon.\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n5 June, 2017\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do with this power, if I can call it that. It sounds almost funny to think of it that way, though. Like *I\u2019m* a superhero. So far I\u2019ve saved people only from humiliation or minor inconvenience, no burning buildings or car crashes, nothing warranting a spandex outfit. \n\nIt\u2019s just that I carry around toothpicks now, scratching out the chewed up meals from people\u2019s teeth. Today, after getting some nice pictures of the Eiffel Tower with hardly any people in the background (I waited over an hour for the opening), I rescued a coffee from the roof of a car and placed it into the interior cup holder. \n\nI just want to make an impact. I guess, in a way, everyone is looking for that same sort of gratification. \n\nUntil next time,\n\nMelanie \n\n-------------------------------\n\nPotentially TBC, depending on interest.

I swallowed, and hoped fervently that this would be the end of my woes.\n\nTwo days prior, I had posted the following message:  \n\n\"Hi.  \n\"I'm posting on r/SuperPowers because I figure it's the most likely place the person with the power to stop time will be likely to read it. My message to you, in short?  \n\"Quit it, jackass.  \n\"So the first time I noticed time had stopped, I was a bit surprised.  Then, I thought it was kind of neat.  I mean, it's handy being able to cross the road in an instant without having to watch out for traffic.  At least not *as much* as usual; it's always prudent to cross behind the vehicles in case they suddenly start moving again.  \n\"But this crap starts to get annoying when you're half-way through a shower and you can't get all the shampoo out of your hair because the water stops flowing.  Waving your head around in a bunch of suspended water-droplets simply doesn't cut it.  Not to mention it's impossible to flush the turd that floats suspended in mid-air in the toilet bowl when time just happens to stop right after you drop a deuce.  \n\"There's only so much time you want to stand around waiting for your order at McDonald's because you want a fresh Chicken Sandwich, and do you know what it's like to be stuck in an elevator with some slob who must have eaten nothing but beans and sauerkraut for week, whose farts sound like a moose in rut and smell like the same moose a week after it's been shot? It sucks.  It *really* sucks.  \n\"So, whoever you are, I'm asking you to quit it.  It's getting old, fast.  Now if there's a way that I can also be frozen in time along with everything else every time you use your powers, I'm open to that solution.  But if not, if I'm stuck one more time having to wriggle out of my mother-in-law's unnaturally long embrace because you decide now is the perfect time to freeze time for whatever the hell you're doing, I'm going to lose my shit.\"  \nLicking my lips, I clicked the icon.  The message was short and to the point:  \n\"lol sux 2 b u\".  \nI cradled my head in my hands.  Great.  Just great.",

Fifteen after.  My watch shows 8:18.  \u201cI didn\u2019t notice for three minutes,\u201d I say as I sigh.  \u201cOh well, I\u2019ll grab a snack.\u201d\nI don\u2019t usually think out loud; only when I know I won\u2019t be heard.  This is one of those times, but as I approach the gas station, I quiet down, just in case.  Inside, I take my time browsing until I settle on an ice cream sandwich from the cooler.  I set a couple bucks on the counter, probably more than the sandwich is worth, and look at the man standing in line.  Balding, angry and covering the bags under his eyes with sunglasses.  I\u2019d say middle-management, heading out for the weekend with his family.  They\u2019re waiting in the car while he negotiates the rising price of gas.  I step back outside and glance at his car while I\u2019m passing.  Two kids and a dog.  Poor guy.  He\u2019ll probably have an aneurism before he gets his next promotion.  The ice cream drips down my hand, and I continue to wander aimlessly.\nMy watch shows 8:25.  It\u2019s a long one today.  Maybe I\u2019m getting better at controlling it.  After a short mental debate, I head to the closest park bench.  Another drop falls down my hand, following in the trail of its predecessor.  This one drips off, freezing in midair as soon as it disconnects from me.  If I ever find a girlfriend, I\u2019ll show her the wonders of the world.  As long as we hold hands, our lives will be infinite.  I pondered for a moment on whether or not I grew old during these interludes, knowing I wouldn\u2019t have the first clue on how to check.\nMy watch shows 8: 30.  I glance up at a formation of geese, frozen just like the drop of cream in front of me.  An imagined movement catches the corner of my eye.  The clock tower shows 8:21 frozen on its face and my breath catches.  Did time start again?  I didn\u2019t feel the usual stomach lurch.  Maybe I\u2019m just getting used to it, finally.\nThe geese still hover above me, and the woman in the car at the gas station still has that stupid expression on her face.  I hear the click as the clock tower hits the half hour.  My attention turns once more to the magnificent gothic building and the man on top of it, fixing some antenna or another.  He stands and turns, looking down on me.  Though I can\u2019t see his expression, it has to be as dumbfounded as mine.\n",

I just wanted to buy some new clothes, but it\u2019s a day when everyone comes. I blink and they stop. \n\nThe world goes silent and every person is still. I slip around people and head off to Macy\u2019s. I pick out my clothes (a new dress, a new pair of jeans, and a hat) when no one can look at me or speak to me. And then I get in line behind everyone else at the check out.\n\nI blink and they move again.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve paid for my clothes and have walked away from the counter, I freeze time again. Soon enough, I\u2019m putting the bag in my purse and then hopping on my bike. You can\u2019t drive a car when the rest of them are still, but you can get a bike around them. It wears you out the same, but it\u2019s still like you got home in an instant. \n\n\u201cHey! Hey!\u201d\n\nI almost crash my bike. I brake and manage to stop. Around me, the world is still frozen. All except one man, who is jogging towards me. \n\n\u201cYou can move too!\u201d He\u2019s excited. He\u2019s at least a decade older than me. \u201cWhen everything stops. You can move too.\u201d\n\nI stare at him. \u201cWait... you...\u201d\n\nHe nods. \u201cYeah, since I was a teen. This thing happens.\u201d He waves around himself. \u201cEveryone freezes for a few minutes or a few hours... and then it starts again. Never know when. Sucks, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sucks?\u201d I ask. It\u2019s the greatest thing ever to me. Why would it suck for him?\n\nHis excitement kinda dies down. \u201cI was on the interstate once. Few years ago. Time stopped, my car stopped... but when it started again, my hands were off the wheel and I was looking out the back window. Car went straight back to sixty but I wasn\u2019t controlling it...\u201d He lets out a heavy sigh. \u201cMy wife died in the accident.\u201d\n\nI feel like I can\u2019t breathe. It\u2019s my fault. I killed this man\u2019s wife. \n\n\u201cHey, kid, relax. You\u2019re smart. You already figured out you shouldn\u2019t get behind the wheel of a car, didn\u2019t you? Whatever weird quirk of the universe this is, we just gotta live it out.\u201d He laughed. \u201cMake sure you cross those streets real fast though. You never know when the cars will start moving again.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. My freezing and unfreezing time could kill him. I\u2019ll never know what situation he\u2019s in. If it\u2019ll be safe for me to make the world move again. \n\n\u201cI gotta get home,\u201d I say. I start biking away.\n\n\u201cSee you later, kid,\u201d he says. But when I\u2019ve gone just a little ways away, I stop and look back at him. \n\nHow am I supposed to use my power when I have to worry about him?\n\nHe steps out onto the road where cars are frozen at forty-five miles per hour. He\u2019s moving fast to get across before they start again.\n\nI blink. ",

            "comment": "he first time the incident occurred I was in a busy mall. I bumped into the person in front of me and apologized, but I got no response. A moment later she fell forward. What a bitch! Not only did she ignore me, but she completely over-reacted with such a delayed response. She screamed, and a bunch of tough-looking guys approached me. Oh boy, I was in for a fight. I braced myself for the first punch, but his fist stopped mid-swing. Perplexed, I noticed that EVERYTHING had stopped in that moment. I quickly used my advantage to retaliate and back away. As time began to move again, he flew backwards from the impact. Seeing my \"quick\" movements, everyone backed away. I used this chance to flee.\n\nYou would think that moving through stopped time would be cool, but I soon realized that I had no control over it. It would only last a few seconds each time, but that was enough for me to collide with someone. Worse yet was if I was driving. There was no way for me to set the pedal back to normal if I pressed too hard, so I could easily speed up if I wasn't paying attention. I soon made it my mission to find out who was doing this to me.\n\nMy search finally led me to Egypt, where I saw it. A man with golden hair yelled out \"Za Warudo!\" and time stopped. Even though I had finally met my tormentor, I felt such an immense pressure emanating from this man. My own body froze, and probably for a good reason: the man casually stuck a knife through someone's neck. \"Time will begin to move again\", he proudly proclaimed. And with that, he went on with his business as if nothing had happened. This man was extremely dangerous, but I couldn't let him notice me. \n\nI had to follow this man to stay out of his line of sight at all times. If he saw me move in stopped time, I was dead. In the time spent following him, I saw some truly bizarre shit.\n\nEventually some foreigners confronted him, but there was nothing I could do. I couldn't risk my life for these people. Instead I had to watch in horror and hope they could figure it out on their own.\n\nSadly, a few of them lost their lives in that process. First a high school student who could manifest this green webbing of some sort thought he had cornered him. But sadly he was no match for this man. I had to watch as he casually unwove the kid's web and then finish it up with a punch straight through his stomach. I had to resist the urge to puke.\n\nThe next to fall was an old man who could create this weird purple vine. Apparently the golden-haired man couldn't physically touch him, so he precisely threw a knife at his throat. I braced myself for the murder that was going to unfold in front of my eyes in mere seconds. \n\nAs I grieved for the death of the old man, his apparent grandson received the critical knowledge of that man's ability. There was hope, but what could this kid do? Fly was apparently the answer. Bizarre. \n\nI watched knowing that it was useless for him to keep fighting (or at least the man thought so). However there was a glimmer of hope! The kid moved in stopped time! It seems like the first twitch was a trick with a magnet, but the sucker-punch was no illusion. He killed the man!\n\nOr so I thought. I couldn't exactly comprehend it, but apparently he is immortal. FML. That didn't stop the kid from trying though. The following battle was too crazy to fully explain. \n\nThe fight was so ridiculous that it ended with the two punching their way through a fucking road roller! wtf, where did that come from? But the kid did it, and my hell was over. That man was finally dead. I was free at last!\n\nOr so I thought, until it began to happen 10 years later. I'm done with this shit.",

            "comment": "I never liked New York. Too loud, too many people, too many opportunities. Unfortunately, I don't get to choose where I go. It's not the first time I've been here, and I'm sure it won't be the last. \n\nI looked around as I walked down one of the bigger streets, moving towards the large pillar of black smoke that hung in the air. All these people walked with me, yet none of them moved. Cars and buses on the road, frozen in time. As I always do, I found a man eyeing a woman, and joined their hands. When time resumes, they'll both be embarrassed, and more than a little confused. Most often, I imagine they'll stammer something out about an accident and move along. But I like to think that maybe just once over the millennia, they started talking to each other. That I started something good, that I was a positive force in the world.\n\nAs I got closer I saw the building, which was completely encapsulated by frozen flame. On the sidewalk across the street were the usual signs; a few people covered in ash, faces locked in a scream, limbs stuck at odd angles. A cat with burned fur, and even a hamster upside down on the ground. I moved next to the people and stood perfectly still. \n\nI heard the Chosen burst through the front door of the building, and put yet another person on the ground next to me. The Chosen came into my line of sight then; this one was a woman in her mid 30's. She didn't notice that I was new to the scene, because of course, she knew that no one else can move while time was stopped. She must have missed me the first time. Of course.\n\nYou see, it always goes the same way. People saved from a fire, an evil emperor dethroned; an invisible hero emerges. Perhaps God had returned to humanity, or children's stories had finally come to life. Usually this lasts for years, once even a decade. But eventually, the reality of the situation sets in for the Chosen. They save thousands of lives, but millions more need saving. People will always be in danger, and the infinite nature of their own lives makes the constant effort seem worthless. They grow bored of being the hero, and come to understand that they can really do *anything* they want. It starts small- a bit of money missing from a bank, a politician acting strange. But as it's said, absolute power corrupts absolutely. The Chosen grow more controlling, more bold. I was born under Cesar, who was the last Chosen to go unchecked. \n\nA few minutes later, it seemed the woman had saved everyone in the building. Nine people in total; an impressive hero indeed. As she stood back to admire her work, I drew the same knife I had used to kill Cesar all those years before and cleanly cut her throat.\n\nI hate seeing their faces as they die. So innocent, so surprised. Like her, they're all firstly confused because someone else could move while time was locked. But even more, they didn't understand why someone would kill a person who only wanted to help. But how could they? They haven't seen what I have, nor the course that they all will take.  \n\nTime launched back into motion, and the chaos of the situation resumed. Amid sirens and screaming, I ran a couple blocks away from the building and joined a mass of people staring at the fire. It would be about 10 years before another would be Chosen. 10 years to think about the people I've killed, to think about the monster who snuffs out the light before it can burn too bright.",

            "comment": "I didn't love my job.\n\nThat's not too unusual. Most people don't love their job. So I guess in that respect, I'm not special. But I couldn't help but feel like I *really* didn't like my job. Being a store associate at Best Buy was like being a lion tamer and a dog trainer all rolled into one. You had to beat back people's anger all day, then show them exactly how to do things the right way. Against their will, usually.\n\nSo when the Silence appeared as Mrs. Hendricks was complaining about her 4 year old iPad she bought from us not connecting to the WiFi... again... it was a welcome respite. \n\nIn the beginning when it first started happening -- after the shock wore off -- I used to think the Silence was some sort of universal signal to chill for a second. A sign things were getting to be too much in my life, and Someone, Somewhere wanted to give me a moment's peace to enjoy the absolute, suffocating quiet the Silence brings. It feels like being outside right after the first snowfall when the world is on pause and everything's just taking a moment to enjoy the stillness.\n\nNow? I'm not so sure anymore. \n\nI strode away from my station and out into the hot Texas air. Compared to the hermetic, air-conditioned Best Buy, the outside felt wild and rugged and free. Ambling to my '95 Civic, I paused to consider what exactly I should do with my time. These pauses could last just a couple minutes, or go on for hours, and I never wanted to get too far from the store in case everything snapped back into reality.\n\nThe black birds that normally hung around the parking lot were frozen in the sky above me, their undulating flock trapped in a moment of time mid-swirl over the Cherry Berry. Of everything in the Silence, I liked seeing the birds most of all. Like a frozen waterfall in winter, the birds seemed to vibrate with an energy even when still. Their purpose was evident even when not moving, and I loved feeling their drive over the stillness of the Silence. \n\nAs I stood admiring the birds, I heard it. Faintly. \n\nA car engine. \n\nThe silence had been broken. I was not alone.",

Estimated relative time experienced is approximately 15 years... uncorrected. \n\n\nThis is my final voice log. \n\n\nI have been running tests since the events started happening, and feel I can conclusively state that I never had control over this phenomenon.\n\n\nUpon confirming the events were not brief, transient hallucinations as I had first feared, my next concern was that my research had developed\u2026 temporal side effects. \n\n\nYou will know by now many of my other working explanations proved fruitless, at least initially. Today though, I think I\u2026  I uh\u2026 have a fuller picture. \n\n\nThe fact that the events were initially very brief prevented me from gathering useable early data, it wasn't until event 246 I began cataloguing. This was the first 1-hour plus event. They started becoming erratic. Brief at times, and then far longer events, occurring side by side, sometimes within hours of each other in calendar time. By event 314, I had noted no indications during CT that the events were adversely affecting anyone else in the world. Google scrapes for event-related keywords rendered no hits. I gave up predicting patterns which may have occurred in nature, and deduced these events may be being caused intentionally. By someone else. This was also when they started increasing in duration into relative days. \n\n\nAt this point I became aware I could no longer continue my research. On the off-chance my devices were causing or exacerbating events I couldn't risk continuing, despite my hope they may prove to be my solution. I considered coming clean. Explaining. but\u2026 the university\u2026 finding out would have ended my career and I had no guarantee events would continue. If I\u2019d known\u2026 &lt;inaudible, away from mic&gt; anyway, I didn't relish the opportunity of spending months in a secure psychiatric unit during events so there's that\u2026 I truly hope there is no way anyone would have believed me\u2026 \n\n\nI resolved to continue passive monitoring of the phenomena and maintaining daily life as far as possible in between. My efforts to explore how far the events spread (to ensure they were not localised pocket dimensions or anomalies) began at event 587. My discovery that the events held geographically allowed me to consider further exploration. But with events extending, much of my time was spent in between cataloguing details. Given that at any point time could stop, and it could be relative weeks, or even months until I had to resume my life, I had to ensure CT continuity so as not to arouse suspicion. \n\n\nAfter event 701, the longest expedition, I realised it would be too risky to travel during any other events. Co-workers and\u2026 Pamela, they were\u2026 &lt;sobbing sound\u2026 Crashing noise&gt; \u00a0they noticed my appearance change. My travel exacerbated the ageing process as if my time relative to the source of the event was not constant. \u00a0This is why I created my remote lab and ceased interacting with my pre-relative time contacts. My wife in particular could detect even minor changes in my physical appearance during CT days, between events. She always\u2026. Those eyes of hers\u2026 \n\n\nThe relative passage of time had however appeared to vary with direction. I have repurposed my devices and believe these variations can now be monitored during events. I apologise to whoever finds this recording for the pages of hand-written data, but my hands are not what they were. I estimate approximate relative ageing, accounting for both event-time and travel-related anomalies to be approximately 20 years. As the events started in my early sixties, and I have been absent medical care for much of this time, I don't\u2026 I\u2026 I don't have long. \n\n\nThe batteries in my devices are depleting. In this recorder too. Mains electricity never worked during events\u2026 &lt;laughter&gt;... Of all the\u2026 anyway. I am no longer mobile enough to source food, let alone batteries. \n\n\nTell Pamela I'm sorry for the worry she has experienced in the last few weeks. I just\u2026 She didn't need to see me like this. \n\n\nUse my work. Find them. Please. &lt;inaudible&gt;\n\n\nEnd recording.",

I was quite glad to know that ny boring life wasn't really boring anymore.\n\nThe best thing that ever happened to me because of the Time Freeze(TM) was the accident I \"did not\" get into. In other words, a truck kind of almost hit me but apparently I did not get hurt because of the freeze. I think that is when I was grateful for whoever or whatever that was doing it. Because I realised, that you cannot get hurt in a freeze.\n\nAnd that my friends, opened a world of opportunities. You know that cycling trick you kind of always thought was cool to learn but then the too many failed attempts just kind of leaves you with broken bones? Well, I nailed it.... after about 50 Time Freezes. \n\nBut there was one thing that this had given an opportunity to do. Get over my fear of heights. See, ever since I was a kid, I have had this unreasonable fear of heights. With my parents being divorced and my Mom living hundreds of miles away, it has become difficult to meet her. \nThis is perhaps the only way to get over my fear.\n\n\nDear diary,\n\nI think my Mom would kill me if she knew the kind of stuff I have been getting upto. \n\nBut!!

Now quiet are the footsteps of strangers and the roaring of waterfalls alike. It is not still yet, but it is quiet. It is a respite before the true work begins, for it only lasts for the blink of an eye before all else comes to a halt. Not like the stopping of a body in motion, but of an immediate lifelessness - the switching off of a lamp in the deepest of night.\n\nAnd then the work begins. There is the Hunter, unseen, mute, but with power unimaginable. It is the power to stop the world itself, to cease the descent of the waters of time through the cracks of futures unseen. And the Hunter does speak, but only I can listen, for I am the Blade.\n\nI do not pass judgement, you must know. The Blade only exacts the will. I would not have chosen it. It chose me. It poisons me. I have become it: a thin scrap of wire, a bullet fired, a razor's edge, a thick metal bar. My face is ghastly white, my hands are stained with nearly three-hundred. I do not sleep, I do not wish, I am one with the timeless hate of the Hunter.\n\nA patch of grass ripples in silence. It is a clue to the path I must follow.\n\n\"Fiat voluntas tua, swift and silent.\"\n\nI begin to run, my breath exhaled in the cold spring air stops like little clouds. The grass ripples, a can rolls, the water churns against the river's edge. I follow, sprinting after as the world awakens in a thin line towards the next (pray it be the last) who has been judged. I climb, I leap, I follow the trail unfurled before me, arriving at an alley, dark, muddy, and reeking of piss and destitution.\n\nA handsome man in his thirties holds a phone to his head. His fingers begin to come to life.\n\n\"What, what the hell?\"\n\nHe looks about - that same look of wild confusion they all get, like a rat dropped suddenly to a quaking mass of serpents. And I make my presence known, drawing a heavy length of iron from besides a dumpster.\n\n\"Two rivers diverge through the wasteland of time. Choose left or right,\" I shout, my voice hardly concealing excitement.\n\n\"What?\" mutters the rat.\n\n\"Choose left or right.\"\n\n\"Uh, left?\"\n\nI swing the iron, which collides solidly with his body, now frozen again. I watch as he is divided, on version illuminated in the pale teal light, the other increasingly battered. The Hunter takes the light and the Blade leaves - I leave - I disappear to the dark cocoon which I will once again spring forth, at the bidding, when the world stops once more.",

            "comment": "You know the old cliche, \"Time froze for a moment when...\"?  It's certainly not all it's cracked up to be when you're not the one who's in control.  \n\n\nThe first time I experienced a time stop, I'd fumbled my keys on a rainy day.  As I started the useless gesture of the bobble and catch, they slowed and then stopped in the air.  They remained frozen along with every drop of rain hanging in the air for the next few seconds while I completed the awkward catch in complete silence of a frozen world. I stood there in shock as the rain returned to soaking me while I stood near my car in shock. Holy crap, I had powers!\n\n\nAround 60 years ago, people started to get abilities.  They originally blamed it on the atomic bombs, but after years of study, no one's found an answer as to why it started.  We've discovered some weird rules as to how they work though.  \n\n\n1:  Powers are rare.  This is the most soul crushing childhood discovery next to finding out Santa wasn't real.  Everyone wanted powers.  When you're a kid, it's all dreams of super heroes in all their paneled page glory.  \n\n\n2:  Powers always manifest in pairs. Nearly all pairs were twins.   Siblings will sometimes gain powers, and there are reported cases once in a while of half siblings developing powers.   This lead people to study if there was some sort of quantum genetic link, but there's been no genetic link found.\n\n\n3:  Power pairs are always opposing in effect, yet complimentary in what they affected. The first well known pair was a set of twins named Robert and Dale Kingsman.  They could heat and freeze water on command. They'd been making a killing as stage magicians before their powers were discovered with an act that had the big finale be a take on the classic water tank escape. It started with the standard chains and straight jacket, but then it took a powered twist.  Robert would be bound and lowered into the tank while Dale would be outside. He would then freeze the water tank, taking care to let Robert melt enough water around himself to not freeze and melt a drain hole at the bottom.  They'd then pull the tank away leaving the mostly solid block of ice center stage.  After he'd freed himself, Robert would quickly melt the walls to have the ice shatter around him in a rather stunning display.  They now have a show in Vegas where they use their powers openly.\n\n\n4:  Powers only work when the pair are in fairly close range.  There is a direct link that proves powers increase in potency when the pair are near each other, even the widest range powers can only reach about twenty yards and stay effective.  There is a cautionary tale of a bother/sister pair who could increase and decrease air pressure who were working as underwater welders.  I'll spare the gory details, but it ends in them both getting the bends 50 meters underwater because they stopped holding hands. \n\n \n\n\nI stood in the rain getting soaked while trying to piece it together. I was shifting between ecstatic and confused. I couldn't have powers.  But I'd just stopped time!  Who was my partner? I was an only child.  Did I just discover some deep dark family secret?  WHERE was my partner?  The parking lot was empty, the only living thing in nearly 100 yards was a soggy looking seagull that was picking at a trash can.  Shaking my head, I got in the car and start to head home.\n\nTen minutes into the drive, I nearly slammed my face into the steering wheel when it happened again.  I had about half a second to brace as everything around me slowed and stopped... except me.  The stories all  seemed like once the power manifested, the pairs instinctively knew how to control them.  Just another puzzle to solve.  Fortunately, I managed to get home with all my teeth in my mouth.  There were three more stops on the way home, each getting slightly quicker and lasting longer.  I don't know if it continued as I was asleep, but it only got worse the next day.\n\nYou know how annoying it is to have a video buffer?  I will never complain about that again now that my actual life was buffering.  Every five minutes, everything would just stop for about 45 seconds.  It was getting worse, each one longer than the last.  Making an appointment at the research center was an exercise in patience, I couldn't tell if I'd been put on hold or if time had stopped again.  I was starting to figure out what I could affect while stopped at least.  Stuff I touch would continue moving as long as I was touching it.  Simple machines would keep working, so I could ride a bike, but my car would lock in place just like the first day.  I was thankful for bikes at least working, the university was across town and I didn't want to walk 15 miles.\n\nI pedaled my way east, I started to really think about it.  I must have had stopped at least 250 times by now without any control over them... Maybe it wasn't my ability that was causing this.  During the next stop, I concentrated on my watch that had stopped like everything else in the world and willed it to start moving.  While everything else was still silent and still, I heard my answer in a resoundingly solid tick.  After time began moving again, I concentrated on my watch until the next stop.  I compared it to a frozen bank sign.  It was three minutes ahead.  \n\nIt only took two more stops to figure out that I could cancel it nearly instantly, fast enough I was confident enough to ride a bus the rest of the way. When I arrived at the research center, the stops were up to a half hour each, roughly every ten seconds.  The only thing preventing me from being trapped in a frozen hell was my ability to cancel it.  They took scans, poked and prodded, had me demonstrate my ability, and finally sent me to a waiting isolation room. A pair of undergrads named Karen and Kelly pointed out the coverings of the room and explained that they'd been able to create a material that dampened powers to such an extent that an inch of it could nearly shut off a pair's ability.  They demonstrated it with Kelly producing a ball of light while Karen walked out of the room.  The light immediately went out.  \n\nAfter the twins had left, I looked around at my refuge.  The room was covered in two feet of the wool like material, which seemed like overkill since Karen had said in testing no pair could activate powers through more than 4 inches of the stuff.  The reassuring hum of the lights overhead and the ticking of the clock convinced me that everything was fine.  They were doing measurements and tests  in the next room, there was a camera with a monitor that I could talk to them through.  They had a nice setup here, I kicked back in the chair and relaxed with a magazine, glad I might have some answers soon.  For the first time in two days, I felt in control.\n\nThe soft chatter of the lab blended into the background noise as I was reading about the new Nissan, it was very peaceful in the isolation room.  It was silent except the beating of my heart-  No!  Panicked, I look up at the clock that's frozen in time, the lab feed, just a still life.    Reaching out for my pair, if they weren't going to stop this, I'd make sure they knew where I was. I pushed outward with all the frustration and rage, panic and fear. Suddenly, everything was moving at chipmunk speed in the lab, and I could feel it, somehow.  My pair was here.  I let the bubble fall, exhausted.  Kelly rushed into the room, confused as I explained what had happened.  It was then that another lab coat came rushing in with some xrays.  They'd found the answer.\n\n\nI looked at the film, dumbfounded.  There, tucked underneath my rib, was the twin I must have absorbed in the womb.  Our power was so strong because we not only had physical contact, we were one in the same.  The doctor had suggested surgery to remove my unexpected passenger, although it may be difficult with the time stops being nearly continual now.  \"This would, of course, result in the loss of your abilities, but-\" \n\nAs he said that, I let the cancellation drop. Time locked into place while I came up with a plan.  As the doctor stood there, still frozen, I walked out into the lab and found a laptop bag to the side of someone's desk.  I gathered all of documents they had been working on, pushed small bubbles of normal time into the computers to delete anything created over the last few days, removing any and all traces I'd ever been there.  \n\nI walked out the doors to a new, wonderful world of silence that was mine for the taking.  It might not be the comics, but Super Powers has a bit of a ring to it. ",

            "comment": "Once again, It just has to happen at awkward times like this. I was just munching away peacefully on my snacks when time itself stopped and now I have them in my mouth, partially chewed. The last time it happened it was in mid-poop. It was as if it was coincidentally made to put me in these difficult situations and I am not a fan of it. As usual, I would clean up and walk off to the  nearest park to take my mind off this problem that has been occuring over the past few years. I had a lot of fun initially. They were mainly minor pranks like wetting someone's socks and  snatching the ball away from dogs. I always giggled like a small school girl when time resumed back and see their mugs at the slight inconvenience that they face. This went on for a while, maybe like 50 times before it got annoying. I was bored out of my wits until that one fateful day when I got to meet Jennifer, a beautiful blonde bombshell who often visited the park.\n\n\nIt is very obvious that she was out of my league. She had a beautiful figure that could make any girl green with envy. Her golden hair shimmered warmly in the sunlight. Her long eyelashes pitch black and it further accentuated her big, brown eyes. I could only look at her from afar and bask in her warm glow as a dude that looks like an overweight pitbull. There was no way that I could ask her out, even in my dreams but it is different now. I could stop the time, somewhat.\n\nIt was when I first met her and desired her company that my powers could potentially be controlled. Almost every single time that I see her in the park near my house, time would stop for me. It was as if I was given a chance to interact with her, albiet in a creepy way. I would then make my way to her and you know, like any guy in love would do, would take a closer look at her and admire her beauty. Once again, before time has stopped, I saw her from my window in the park jogging with her best friend Stacy whom I have never seen without each other. I happily scurried my way there as usual and continued my routine.\n\nMy definition of closely observing involved staying at least 100m away from her in a bush hidden from her view. I know time has stopped so I could do whatever I want but have you ever  experienced the awkward feeling of your crush literally crushing you with her speed when time continued? I couldn't even fathom about that time when she ran head first into me and boy did she run fast. Being the nice girl that she is, she immediately apologised to me and briefly resumed her running. So yeah, no more close up for me I guess. \n\nI was back to observing the picturesque scene of her mid-run when I was suddenly taken aback by a figure rustling in the bush opposite to mine. Out of the bush came a burly man with a huge knife that glistened in sunlight.\n\n*wait a damned second, how the hell is he moving?*\n\n*..and why is he moving towards JENNIFER?!*\n\nI was panicking as he trudged ever closer to Jennifer and  Stacy with a big ass knife. He was way too damn scary for me.\n\n*What can I do?! Somebody help them!*\n\nMy petrified body would not budge as my limbs buckled under my own weight. I could not even utter a cry for help as he lumbered over to Jennifer and her friend. Seething pain coursed through me as my gut feeling is telling me to stop him at once or I will regret it for the rest of my life. With the remaining ounce of strength, I made a mad dash towards the goliath.\nOut of the blue, Stacy and Jennifer continued their run. With puzzled looks on their faces, they turned to look at the monstrosity that is slowly approaching them. (Part 1)\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "I finished tying the mans shoelaces together and stood back, waiting for the inevitable flow of time to resume. \n\nI had heard a scream behind me, and just after that happened, time stopped. The older I was getting, the better I was getting at realising it was happening- although it was easier in busy streets when all the bustle and noise of a big city suddenly turned off. It was rather chilling the first few times it had happened. Can you imagine it? A city with thousands around you, silent. Dead silent. You don't realise how unerving it is until you go through it. Hell, if it didn't happen on an almost weekly basis, I'd probably put it down to some sort of psychosis myself. I could make it tangible though. Once you got used to it. You could have fun with it. Empty a beer a mate was holding, or put someones hat onto someone else. I never overstepped lines though- I didn't have the constitution to do that kind of stuff. I was always a little too \"nice\" for my own good. Even though people wouldn't believe it. I told my best friend, Sally, and she just couldn't shake the feeling that I'd do something to her in those moments- It felt really good to know a friend saw you that way. So she now just keeps well away from me. I don't tell anyone about my secret now, and just have my tiny little bits of fun.\n\nThis was different now, this was a situation where I could actually use my power for good. Hell, If I couldn't actually control when I was stopping time, I could still try and use it for good, right? I noticed the man running from a woman who had been recently knocked to the ground, and he was holding a bright pink bag, it was pretty easy to surmise what had happened here.\n\nSo now, I sit here and I wait.\n\nTime started, and the man's right leg pushed forward- but not as far as he was expecting. That glorious fall began- but then it didn't. Time froze again. Odd, this had never happened before, it was never this close to another freeze. Sometimes they happened twice in a day, but never one straight after another...\n\nMovement\n\nI turned my head... something had moved in the corner of my eye. Where was it. I began searching the crowds, looking for that movement again. Did someone else share my powers? How had I never seen someone in 12 years? \n\nStay still and search.\n\nThere.\n\nI started running.\n\n\"Hey you wait!!! You can move too. WAIT!!\" \n\nTime started again, the street came alive. I heard people shouting at the man, who had now definitely fallen over, but I didn't care anymore. I had to follow the woman in a green jumper. I needed answers...\n\nShe weaved in between people, it was dificult to keep up, She was fast, and I was only of average fitness.\n\n\"WAIT!!\" PLEASE!!!!\" People were looking at me, but I didn't care. I needed to talk to her.\n\nShe turned down a side street, and I followed after her. Big mistake. Something collided with my face, and it was hard. I heard my nose crunch, and I dropped to the ground. It was all too much, and the black swallowed me.\n\n-----\n\nThis is my first story I've written. If you want me to continue let me know. I have to run out the house for a bit but I will continue it if anyone wants me to in a few hours.\n",

            "comment": "Stone cold.\n\nAlways when it happened I could feel a sudden change drop in temperature, like the vibrating molecules generating heat themselves froze when time did--I assumed somehow the power to move also gave me the ability to survive any physical impossibilities of all motion stopping, but these moments always sent me strange shivers through me.\n\nAs I had done every time I could recently, I took the chance to look over at her. Her eyes shone animatedly, even when time itself was unmoving; to me the rest of the classroom seemed empty and without life. Her mouth was twisted unattractively in the middle of saying something (telling a joke maybe), long hair resting on her shoulders, hands raised animatedly. Nonetheless, her friends around her sat with expectant expressions on their faces. That boy always tagging beside her was already laughing before she was even done talking. I sent a feeling of commiseration his direction.\n\nShe always was the most charismatic one out of--well, all of us, really, the single star in the dark space that was our small town high school. The last time time froze she had this coy, playful look on her face that made me wonder whether it was her manipulation of words or the way her body itself seemed like an extension of her personality that the reason that people drew closer to her. Either way it seemed everyone in the entire school was in love with her.\n\nThe danger in staring (or taking advantage of the pauses at all, really) was that I didn't know when time would unfreeze--and sure enough, before I could react, she raised an eyebrow at me, an open question about my gaze. I looked away quickly, a warmth clinging to my cheeks that was distinct from the wave of humid summer heat that I could suddenly feel again.\n\nI don't know when it started exactly--I think the first few times time paused were so brief I probably just shrugged them off. The first pause lengthy enough for me to realize that the world had frozen but I hadn't happened when I was in a car. Seeing all the traffic around (the stony passenger cars with stony-faced passengers, the trucks burdened with the weight of society) in crystal-clear focused detail in the middle of moving at 80 kilometers an hour left me so mesmerized that I hadn't even unbuckled my seatbelt before time resumed.\n\nI tried everything, of course, to reproduce the effect; but now, after what must be 200 odd occurrences (that I was aware of, anyway--who knows how many happened when I was asleep) I had more or less concluded that they were random, something out of my own control. I imagined that there was someone out there, using time freezes as a tool to achieve his or her goals, whatever they were. Maybe it was a superhero. Or, maybe it was a less than heroic person? Or what if there was no point to them at all? Just the universe arbitrarily selecting me for this treatment, afflicting me and then leaving me with no explanation.\n\nEither way it made me feel minuscule, tiny in the face with great unknown forces I could not understand. Even this love of mine, consuming as it was, felt suddenly and terrifyingly small and unimportant.\n\nIt seemed to me anyway even if she stayed frozen with the rest of the world, she could take of herself better than whatever I could try to do to help her.\n\nThe next time it happened I was by the grass field just outside the school area. At the start of lunch period I was seized by the longing to be by myself, away from people. She shot me the second puzzled look of the day as I walked past her to the door in the first floor hallway. I just kept my head down.\n\nThe long grass that had been moving in the wind now laid there suddenly transfixed, caressed by an invisible hand that now too was frozen. The leaves blown off the rustling shadows of trees beyond the field floated there in mid air, seemingly unperturbed. I turned my gaze to the blue summer sky, scattered by far off cirrus clouds. A plane hung there, in the distance, silent.\n\nLaying back against the cool grass by the fence, I put my sandwich down beside me. \n\nI closed my eyes, and imagined seeing something moving.",

I suppose your own perception of time has changed a bit, too. But anyway. I'm glad you did. I'm glad you reached out to me. And by what means! I applaud you, really. A fanciful post in a popular internet platform. An innocent thing to gather imaginative minds. Brilliant!\n\nI suppose you have questions. Tons of them. About the nature of time, about me, about yourself. As you might imagine, I am not yet willing to give you everything. I have no idea who you are, and what you would do with the information.\n\nAs you realised, I am doing this at will. Simply put, I stop time. For a short spell, yes. I am trying to make it last longer (from my and your perspective, of course) but so far I have not been able to bear the pressure for longer than what feels like a few minutes. Do you feel it too? That pressure in the back of your head? I do not suppose you do.\n\nHow did it start and why does it happen to you? I don't want to give too much away right now, as it would endanger some people. Still I'll tell you this. Science was involved. An accident occurred. You were collateral and absolutely random. They tried to find you, but they never did: another accident occurred. It happens, I suppose.\n\nWhat do I do when time stops? I see you have been having fun. At least after the few initial and totally understandable breakdowns, that is. And considering you have no idea when it happens it's the only thing to do. I wonder what mischief you did. It must be very interesting to be able to move through the non-time without having to maintain the effect. I have quite mastered by now, but takes a toll on me. Think solving equations while lifting weights and trying to dictate a groceries list. It doesn't allow me as much freedom of action as it apparently does to you. Which brings me to my next and final point.\n\nI am turning this into a profession. A side thing for now, but who knows? I could very much use the talents of someone like you. I will be watching closely now that I've found you. Trying to figure out the type of person you are.\n\nYou might hear from me again.",

Randomly, time for everyone else would just, bam, come to a halt. At first, I just thought it was a normal thing for everyone. That changed quickly. Then I tried to take advantage of it, with middling success (it just so happens that when you have to do everything you want without knowing when time will resume, it gets a little stressful). Then I went through a religious phase, thought it was god screwing with me or something. Then, just once, out of the corner of my eye, I saw him.\n\nI was 20 at the time. I\u2019m old now. Much older. Lived and loved (or tried to at least) and did all I wanted with the little bonus of some extra time for contemplation every once in a while. Which I usually spent thinking about the grocery mall that had a guy, about the same age as me, moving. I was honestly in shock. It was when I was out of town for a business \u201cteam building seminar\u201d (ugh) and all I could do was stand there with my mouth open. This guy had a mission. He was moving with a plan. And in a moment I knew it. I was his carryon. Somehow, I\u2019d gotten in his little slip of spactime (I sound smart when I say that, don\u2019t I?). Never saw him since. Now I\u2019m old and admittedly a little crotchety and this bastard has been making me go crazy.\n\nI go into a hospital. Not for any particular reason, just curiosity. It\u2019s usually an interesting place with things happening and doctors and whatnot. Not today though. For some reason, all of the staff was in one room, looking over an empty bed. Huddled around in their unorganized-yet-calculated way, each one with a clipboard in one hand and a lab coat and name tag. A young brunette with what looks to be her fianc\u00e9 are hugging and crying, an older man looks on with his wife, and some young kid without a brain is hesitantly prodding the air above the mattress. A heartwarming tableau really. And the lab coats insulating the family from the outside. And the footsteps you hear when\u2014wait. Footsteps?\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nI freeze. Not because of time or anything, just nerves I guess. \u201cWhat the  SHIT!\u201d\n\nOkay, not my proudest or most eloquent moment, but in three years of not being surprised, the shock has a way of building up.\n\n\u201cHow are you moving?\u201d His tone is puzzled, more than anything.\n\n\u201cYou.\u201d I say, and turn to meet the hunchback of Notre Dame. No. Wait. That\u2019s a man. Well he\u2019s short so sue me. His hair isn\u2019t doing him any favors either. Black with the perfect amount of whispiness to accentuate the scalp but not give it definition. Broken nose too. But a face that, however old it was, lived beyond its years.\n\n\u201cMe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou control these things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a question?\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up. Why so long. Why this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know why we happen to meet here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy we\u2014\u201c I look back at the bed, \u201cOh no. You?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He sighs. \u201cNot me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho then?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m met with the a sad grin that I\u2019ll never forget, and as he holds up his left hand, it dawns on me.\n\n\u201cThe wife,\u201d I whisper.\n\nHe nods. \u201cThe wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she can\u2019t\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cNo. She can\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried.\u201d\n\nAll this time, he\u2019s been trying to spend a few extra days with his wife, but with all his power, I\u2019m the only one who can be there for him.\n\n\u201cSit down.\u201d I motion to the bed. We sit. Two old men. One always at the mercy of the other. Until now. I get him to tell me about everyone in the room. The young couple were Brad and Chelsea, lovebirds without a care in the world except for their boy, Andrew. Chelsea had him as a teenager, but Brad stuck through, and the two of them fought the good fight together. Of course, my new friend James helped them out (without their knowledge, of course). We talked about the different times we\u2019d experienced together, separate, and I got some answers to questions I\u2019d had for the longest time.\n\nFinally, I had to bring it up. \u201cJulia,\u201d I said, \u201ctell me about her.\u201d\n\nHe smiled that same old smile at me and said, \u201cdid you ever find...her? You know...\u201d\n\nI raised my ringless hand. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe nodded in silent condolences. \u201cThat was Julia for me. I could do everything for her, but she wouldn\u2019t let me. Kept me honest, she did.\u201d\n\nI thought back to my years and time spent frozen.\n\n\u201cHow long did that last?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe said, without missing a beat, \u201cit didn\u2019t.\u201d I chuckled.\n\n\u201cYou know what you have to do, right?\u201d I said, quietly.\n\nHe just sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to them.\u201d I said.\n\nHe looked away. \u201cNice day out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a nice day out for too long.\u201d\n\nNothing.\n\n\u201cJames\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cGod damn what\u2019s fair!\u201d he roared, \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what I have to do or don\u2019t have to do! I\u2019ll tell you when it\u2019s been too damn long!\u201d\n\n\u201cJames.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. Julia. She deserves an end. These,\u201d he gestures half-heartedly, \u201cpeople deserve to go on. I should do what\u2019s best for them.\u201d\n\nI think for a moment. Carefully, I respond, \u201cJames. *You* deserve an end. You. You have this, this awesome power that lets you never give up. But you need to. Just once, find closure. Please. If not for their sake, for yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d",

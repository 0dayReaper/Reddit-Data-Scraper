            "comment": "\"Goosha?\" I said, tilting my head a bit. \"Who are they?\"\n\nThe alien looked at me strangely. I had difficulty reading his expression. He was almost entirely human in appearance, with angular features and an air of delicacy and grace. The only thing that would separate him visually from a human were his ears; they were long and tapered to a point, sticking out somewhat from his long flowing hair.\n\nBut despite visual similarities to a human, his expression and body language were impossible to read. Impassive and imperious, utterly devoid of any movement that wasn't mediated and pondered. He spoke neutrally and flatly, \"The Goosha? The Lords of the Sky?\"\n\nI could only shake my head in ignorance. Who or what was a 'Goosha'? \"I'm unfamiliar with that word.\"\n\n\"So, the \"red green blue\" is accurate then? You don't have psir cones in your eyes?\"\n\n\"I have no idea what... sire? sigher? Is.\"\n\n\"A pity.\" the alien said, gesturing beside him. \"Because a representative of the Goosha stands before you.\"\n\nI looked to the side of him, and saw only empty air. \"Is this a joke?\"\n\n\"Hardly.\" a snide tone slipped into the alien's voice, his posture subtlely shifting to a haughty loom. \"Goosha are about twelve inches tall, shaped bipedally like you and I, with psir skin and neoil hair. They have two diaphanous ciavi wings and communicate by glowing in a variety of colors.\" \n\n\"I don't know what sire, knee-oil, and see-ah-vee are.\"\n\n\"Hmm. I suppose not.\" the alien sighed resignedly. \"You would need psir cones to see the other colors that happen when you mix red blue and green with them. A pity. \" he held his chin a moment in consideration. \"What about the Sebt? The Tintari?\"\n\nI could feel my face getting hot. \"I don't know *those* words, either.\"\n\nThe alien's expression grew... I think it was cold. \"The Lords of Magma and Sea? You don't know of them, either?\"\n\nI slammed the table. \"Look, Mister... whatever your name was, if you wish to open contact with our world, you are going to have to stop with these juvenile pranks. There are NO people living on this planet by ANY of those names.\"\n\n\"Re-open contact you mean.\" the alien said, not missing a beat. \"And my name is Aedwyn. We use to *share* this world with Men, before we left to cross the western sky. But it seems Men have forgotten much of their own people's past.\"\n\nIn the empty space to Aedwyn's right, a burst of color suddenly flaired into existence, brilliant pinks and yellows. There were brief gaps of nothing, what seemed to be... *holes* in the light.\n\nI fell into my chair, mouth hanging open. \"What... was THAT?\"\n\n\"That was my Goosha friend, making a considerable effort to speak in red-green-blue spectra for your convenience. A terrible strain on them, I do hope you appreciate it.\" Aedwyn settled into his chair, grinning knowingly. \"He was simply reminding me that Goosha, Sebt, and Tintari, are not the words you would know those people's by.\"\n\nAedwyn's grin grew wider, as if coming to the long-anticipated punchline of a joke. \"Goosha: Fairy. Sebt: Dwarf. Tintari: Mermaid. And Iliene...\" he tapped the points of his tapered ears briefly, \"Elf.\"\n\n\"NOW, maybe you remember?\"\n",

This is not a short story prompt- well it can be, but its just a waste of potential to not to. The current top one is one that is left hanging with \u201cyou have so much to learn\u201d. It doesn\u2019t entice me, well no shit we have so much to learn- but give me hints of why, where, what. Hints! Please! Another took the generic dark, gritty view- whilst another chose to go for dolphins. All of which felt sorely lacking in my honest opinion. \n\nThis prompt could\u2019ve gone the obvious sci-fi route with aliens/space or more sci-fi+ fantasy route of inter dimensional beings like stranger things-esque. But nope, somehow you good sir made it work with fantasy. Well fucken done sir, well fucken done. From the introduction of the elf and description, it seemed very elf like both physically and personality- and I couldn\u2019t help think \u201coh great another generic personality\u201d... then that twist in the end. **It actually was an elf.** \n\nSorry, I do apologise for my cursing, and over eagerness, but I have been uninterested in this sub for a while and this prompt\u2019s unique take just revived my interest- so when I found it fresh, I saved it and came back after 3 hours and as to my dismay nothing posted, whilst many being well written with great execution, none proved to be able to make full use of the prompt\u2019s potential. \n\nThen this came along, thank you so much. This is why I\u2019m subbed. Great world building. Great foreshadowing. Solid story, bro, thanks for this.",

Which is why it goes brown with too many paints. \n\nThe primary colours for this are actually cyan, yellow and magenta. Which is simplified to blue, yellow and red. When you mix cyan (Blue + green reflected) and yellow (green + red reflected) you get green, because green is the only colour not being absorbed by either paints. The blue and red has been subtracted.",

CMY was chosen because the pigments were both cheap and could reproduce a decently wide gamut. \n\nThere are other colour spaces that have other primary colours. Any colour space you choose can have arbitrary primary colours that combine to make the colours in your colour space. \n\nThis is a totally different topic to the fact that our eyes are most responsive to three colours, namely red, blue and green (why we're said to have trichromatic vision).

All other colors can be mimicked with combinations of these three. For this reason, the additive primary colors, which are used when dealing with light, are red, green, and blue.\n\nWhen dealing with pigments, however, light is being filtered by them, so the whole thing gets flipped. Thus the subtractive primary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow (the CMY in CMYK). For art classes and the like, this often gets simplified to blue, red, and yellow, since most kids don't even know what cyan and magenta are.",

It's a color that our brains just make up.  Magenta, we call it.  Anti-green, in our circular way of thinking.  \n\nThat's a purely terrestrial defect.  Our Friends from the Conglomerate see things more clearly.  It turns out that everything they've got on what they use for a color wheel is right there in *their* rainbows.  They don't have a magenta.  They have a ghooshy.  We see an imaginary color.  They see a ghostly one, something no combination of our human-perceptible hues can fake.  \n\nDon't be pleased.  Don't be greedy.  Just find a way to beg, borrow or steal some tech that'll let you detect the Ghoosha.  Ghostly-colored things are all around you.  It's a question of long-term survival for our kind -- and what our kind sometimes becomes.\n\nAs for me, I'm here to stay.  For the rest of this life, and hopefully for all of the next.  I'll be the first to make a permanent home up here.  Better to rule on the Moon than to serve in Hell.  There is Hell on Earth.  We've never been alone.  \n\nDon't be surprised.

Aliens land on my lawn last night.\n2. They wake me up at 3:30 , are quite cordial and charming, and carry a mild sedative that they administer by flashing  a lavender colored light in my eye. They also have no mouths. I won't elaborate on their original appearance other than that because I dont want to puke again.\n3. Beautiful lady is the leader, and the one most enthusiastic about changing appearance for me.\n4. They were perplexed about my lack of understanding of what colors and light really are.\n5. They left in a hurry to Washington once\n it was clear I'm not THAT Fred Armary.( Head of NASA)\n\nI don't have time to explain much else other than I found Tom meditating in an Ashram in Meshandisha, India in the Yedysh province, by his social media account.\n\nI was already a seasoned traveler so I went on my way back to the country I'd wandered around in as a youth.\n\nHe said he'd had a dream I'd seek him and he'd been writing about the Ghoosa his whole life. Well, since he saw the Twilight Zone episode about them in 1962.\n\nI looked at him funny when he said that and made a mental note to look that up when I got back to the hostel.\n \nI didn't tell him about the aliens.\n\nTom explains: the Ghoosa are \"pain bodies\" that people give up when they recover from illness. Mental illness creates the strongest ones. They continue existing after we heal as long as we acknowledge them by suffering.  They communicate among themselves and feed on negative energy, and though they are not malicious, they need our suffering to survive.\n\nI sat, dumbfounded and asked about how to see them. And \nHe said something that I'm still going over and over in my head on my flight back to Hawaii.\n\nThey are no longer a separate race.\n\n",

After a few moments,  LEE, one of the scientists from China steps forward and answers in a heavy accent.\n\nLEE\nYes Ambassador, we see the colors red, green and blue. Do you see more?\n\nAMBASSADOR \nOf course, why else would we be here?\n\nLee and the other scientists look preplexed.\n\nLEE\nWe are aware of the other colors in the spectrum and can translate them in representations which we can see, ultraviolet and thermal. Which do you see?\n\nAMBASSADOR \nNo, no, no, I'm talking the true fourth color, the color of the Ghoosha.\n\nLEE\nGhoosha? I do not know this term.\n\nLee turns to the other scientists, they are all as perplexed as he is.\n\nAMBASSADOR \nGhoosha, the other race on this plant. The ones who called us here. How do you communicate with them if you can't see them?\n\nLEE\nThere is no other race on this planet Ambassador.\n\nIn the background it sounds like the President is ending his introduction. \n\nAMBASSADOR\nWell this is confusing. We've seen your movies and know you are aware of the Ghoosha.\n\nLEE\nCan you explain what a Ghoosha is?\n\nAMBASSADOR \nWe see them with spectral vision. They are your dead. They are who called us here.\n\nAt the podium the President steps aside and the Ambassador floats out to the crowd leaving the stupefied scientist behind.",

It happens.\n\n\"I believe I've fixed it.  Now, is it true your species can only exist in three dimensions?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, yes.\"\n\n\"Ah, that explains the lack of faster than light travel.\"\n\n\"I suppose it does,\" I say, twirling a pen in my right hand.\n\n\"So the primary reason for this exchange is technological, I take it?\"\n\nIt asks its questions in that weird imitated monotone of computerized speech.  Must be a fancy AI, too.  It's got simulated inflections and regional dialects and everything.  \n\nPretty deep in the uncanny valley, I'd say.\n\n\"Well we've received many signals from your planet, and offer a simple exchange.  With our upgrades, you should be able to craft spacecraft that are capable of faster than light travel.\"\n\nExcellent.  That's exactly what we wanted to hear.\n\n\"And our corporation will maintain exclusive rights to this technology for the next decade,\" I say.  \n\nIt shakes its tendrils around its head in mock acceptance.  Closest thing to a nod, I assume.\n\n\"In exchange, we'll give you exclusive rights to our combat drone schematics, specifically the orbital defense designs.\"\n\nIt salivates slightly, and something wet and heavy drips onto the floor.\n\nDisgusting.\n\n\"This seems to be a fair exchange, is it not, human?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\nWith this tech we'll be able to beat out those generational colony ships sent out hundreds of years ago, back when we were first starting to crack open asteroids in the belt between Mars and Jupiter.\n\n\"I do have another question, human.\"\n\n\"Ask away,\" I say.  Though I have some idea of what it may be.\n\n\"The Ghoosha sent messages to us as well, asking for aid in exchange for our technology.\"\n\n\"The Ghoosha?\"\n\n\"The other race.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nBit of a sad story, but still, it's just curiosity.  Humans have an amazing ability to forget about the atrocities they'll commit to stay alive.\n\n\"Well that was mostly accidental,\" I say.\n\nAccidental in the way a man takes out a life insurance policy on his soon to be dead partner.\n\n\"They lived beneath the oceans, and couldn't survive on land.  Gills and all, to be precise.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" the alien representative says, though I can't tell if the emotion is genuine or falsified.\n\n\"We killed them before we'd discovered gravitons.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Too much plastic in the ocean.  Shredded their lungs to bits.\"\n\n\"And they asked us to save them?\"\n\n\"We believe so.  No one discovered their messages until after they'd died.\"\n\n\"I imagine it was quite a shock to find underwater civilizations in the deep abyss.\"\n\n\"That it was.\"\n\nThe alien seems to ponder this, and stands to leave.\n\n\"We appreciate doing business with you,\" it says.\n\n\"Likewise.\"\n\nAs it leaves, we already have begun to receive the schematics.  Easily decipherable, though that goes without saying.\n\n*BZZZZZZZZZZ*\n\nA notification from my cybernetic implant.\n\n\"Mr. Rogers?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Shall we upload the schematics now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How long will it take for them to notice they're corrupted?\"\n\n\"Oh, they won't figure it out until it's too late.\"\n\nI take out a cigarette, lighting it and taking a deep drag.\n\nGhoosha.  What a stupid name.  A stupid species that died a stupid death because it wasn't willing to step up and do what needed to be done.\n\nI wonder what they called themselves.  Plenty of anthropologists dig through those strange artificial cities carved into the ocean floor, though the language still can't be deciphered.  Maybe if we sell planet cracking rights to Mercury they'll give us a few more uplifting designs.\n\nGhoosha.  Call them what you want.  I'll just think of them as those idiot squids trapped in oceans so polluted it'd be like trying to breathe through a constant stream of gasoline poured down your throat.\n\nThe aliens will build our designs, and be quite surprised when we activate the backdoor and turn their systems against them.\n\nHell, they never expected their android servants to begin resisting and destroying their own creators.  Whatever they think of us, they don't seem to blame humanity for those schematics.\n\nWhatever.  What's the saying?  Fool me once, shame on you.\n\nFool me twice?\n\nWell that just makes you a sucker.  Infect them with a disease and they come to us for the cure.\n\nNot our fault they gave up warfare a long time ago.\n\nAfter all, there's not that much room in the solar system anymore.\n\nAnd there's always profit to be found in the most unlikely of places.\n\nPerhaps on their home world.\n\nPerhaps on their stations.\n\nPerhaps from their own star.\n\nAnother drag.\n\nWith these ships, it won't take us long to get there.  Scan their system, infiltrate communication arrays, map their colonial strongholds and systematically take what's theirs.  We got shareholders to please and they're impatient sons of bitches.\n\nIt's nothing personal.\n\nJust business.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nr/storiesfromapotato",

I never really read up on prompts nowadays but this one was a twist on a twist. \u201cAliens into unseen race we\u2019ve live with but never known about\u201d. Changing it to \u201coh yeah, that thing we weren\u2019t meant to know? Yeah, we actually killed them\u201d ruins the whole original vibe and just gave this prompt a generic, but still well written, twist to it. \u201cHumans are assholes/its just business/gritty ex army, now mercenary with nihilistic view of the world working for psycopathic businessmen aiming to make more money.\u201d \n\nOverall though, its honestly great stuff, it just left a bitter taste in my mouth. Its like how I feel watching Marvel movies. Same generic stuff, just well done. Its not experimental and different like The Dark Knight or Logan was. Its more like r/ATBGE except r/BTBGE (bad take but great execution).\n\n",

I try to scream, to cry out, but it\u2019s too late. My throat constricts. My jaws clamp. My whole body shuts down.\n\nWith a look on its face that seems perhaps somewhere between shock and terror, the alien turns and flees. \n\nI\u2019m all alone now.\n\nI collapse back into the ground, my head bouncing hard against the pavement. Out of the corner of my eye I watch as blood trickles from my shattered skull.\n\nI lie like that for a time. A still conscious corpse unable to move, to breath, to blink or even move my eyes a little. \n\nDarkness blossoms in my vision, swirling everything away.\n\nMy mind goes last. It feels strange, kind of like how I\u2019d imagine falling into a black hole would be...a stretching and a thinning passing away into nothingness.\n\nIn my very last moments, I hear a voice that seems to emanate from somewhere within me. A voice that speaks in perfectly enunciated English. \u201cHousing unit #111124675846 has been shutdown. It was informed of our existence. We require assistance. Over.\u201d\n\nI really wish I could scream.\n\n",

But as the alien explained a Ghoosa, he slowly start to realise what it was.\n\n\"Yes some people on earth believe in them and every few say that they have encountered them. I consider it a bloody superstition. I believe in what my eyes can see, my ear can hear and my hand can touch\"\n\n\"But your eyes are incapable of seeing them. They are tripolatized and the Ghoosa exists in quarantine spectrum\"\n\n\"Right. Then for me they don't exists\" \n\nThe alien who looked exactly like a human but with absolutely no hair smiled at the ambassador. \n\n\"But they do friend. And people do see them when your mental activity recalibrates for the hormonal surges\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Tell me human, when and where are all the tales of ghosts from?\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you ........ Oh. Fuck oh. \"\n\n\"Yes human. When men are afraid, when the darkness limits the tripolatized spectrum or when the fog filters the white light. It is when all your ghost encounters are. The adrenaline laced blood helps the optic centre focus on what is unseen\"\n\n\"I don't believe in bull shit like ghosts. I am a man of science\" The ambassador was getting up to leave. He continued \"Right if we can't see or touch them, why don't they touch us?\"\n\n\"Oh they do. And you will know when they touch\" the humanoid smiled while his eyes drifted behind the man.\n\nThe ambassador suddenly felt a chill in the air, goosebumps appeared on his forearm and in his reflection on the windowpane behind the alien he saw his dead wife with her hand on his forearm.\n\nThe ambassadors scream and the aliens laughter echoed out of the room as the guards rushed it.\n\n",

            "comment": "I laughed nervously. I shouldn't have done this -- the summit was all but over, broken for a brief recess before the final terms had been agreed to. Diplomacy, it was being called, although it was more like Earth being bound in shackles. \n\n\"Fascinating,\" the alien finally said, the gills on his neck flaring. It blinked, and I fought off a wave of revulsion -- their eyes were too *large*, too empty, and this alien was currently staring at me. After another long, awkward moment, the alien leaned down to get closer. \"Is it true you can only see three basic colors?\" The alien's question was almost *conspiratorial*, a vast difference from the bland tone of the meeting. \n\n\"Three colors?\" I nearly laughed again, but opted for clearing my throat instead. \"No, we see much more than that, although it is true that all the colors we can visualize are based off of three primary colors.\" \n\nThe alien was mostly silent, blinking slowly again. They were all like this. Every action seemed deliberately slow and calculated. \"So then how do you communicate with *Ghoosha*?\"\n\nThe question caught me off guard. \"With *what*? Goo, er, gusher?\" I couldn't quite pronounce the word properly. Human mouths weren't formed for the delicate words and pronunciation of the aliens' language.\n\nThe alien's gills flicked outwards for a moment before resuming their gentle sway. \"*Ghoosha*,\" it corrected, infinitely patient. \"The other major race on your planet.\"\n\nI bit down on my lip, hard, desperately wanting to laugh. Another race? Not possible -- but the aliens never lied. They were careful, pragmatic creatures, and either didn't quite grasp the concept of lying or dismissed the act of lying entirely. Some of us were convinced it was the former, and that the aliens were a gentle, childlike race without a proper grasp on human actions. Over the course of the summit I had seen some world leaders treat the aliens patronizingly. The aliens hadn't seemed to mind, responding to every question kindly and thoroughly no matter how contemptuous -- but they never lied or mislead. That meant that the *Ghoosha*, whatever they were, were real.\n\nIt was my turn to pause. The alien waited for my response, gills swaying. It took me another moment to collect myself. \"We are unaware of the goo-shaw. This is something we should discuss more thoroughly once the summit resumes.\" \n\nThe alien blinked slowly, gills curling at the tips before unfurling. Their features were broad, flat, and grey, as was with most of their kind. It was hard to register emotion -- any emotion -- at all, even with how large their eyes were. Yet it seemed, almost, as if the alien *pitied* me. They blinked again, clear eyelids stretching across their eyes. \"Yes,\" the alien said. \"We should. But may I ask another question?\"\n\nI glanced at my watch. \"If it's quick. We resume in four minutes.\"\n\nThe alien blinked again. \"What color am I to you?\"\n\nI raised a brow. Trick question? No -- it had to be related, overall. The aliens didn't ask without reason and this would be no exception. \"Grey,\" I responded, glancing at my watch again. The alien waited, patiently, and then it clicked -- \"We can't see them,\" I said flatly, looking up at the alien again.\n\n\"Yes,\" it responded, and this time I was sure of it. Pity. It colored their voice. \"It seems we have so much more to discuss.\"",

My hand glistend with thousands of colors, I slowly looked up at the alien being looking bow at me, it was talking again but no longer to its self, another creature floated by it's side, stranger still they both eminated radiant colors, my original keeper picked up a helmet with cords dangling from it and popped it one my head before hurriedly typing something into a computer then he stopped, turning to look at me the color around him changed to something closer to a sickly green, that was the day they found out humans can see emotions with the full color spectrum\n\n\"Well I can't see shidadle now\" I replied, breafly touching the rugged bandages covering my eyes before going back to itching at the small space between the tracking bracelet and my wrist, ",

In the last moments of his life, the illusion fell. \n\nHis face is almost fully translucent. I can see the tips of his fingers. They are pitch black.\n\nThen as suddenly as the fit came upon him, it leaves. Shocked back into reality, I jump to my feet and rush to the ambassador, kneeling beside him. But it is hopeless. He is dead, his illusion existing only in memory. I'm suddenly terrified. \n\nTheir ambassador has died, on our planet, in our midst, seemingly at our hands. This could spell war, and frankly, I don't know whether going nuclear on them could stop that. \n\nI'm feeling cold right now.

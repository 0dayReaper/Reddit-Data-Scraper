One by one, until no one is left.\n\nWhat will happen to me then?\n\nI'll take time to consider this.\n\n*****\n\nFour thousand are left. The four thousand and first committed suicide. It was tragic. He'd lost his entire family. But no one stops fate.\n\nNot even me.\n\nAfter I fulfil my duties, the only thing that remains for me to do is to reap myself.\n\n*****\n\nTwo thousand nine hundred and ninety nine are left. A malnourished couple both died when they tried to cross a river.\n\nIt kind of bothers me how the number is off by one.\n\nIt's like it's telling me: there's one you're not counting. This is a round number.\n\nI don't want to hear it.\n\n*****\n\nTwo thousand are left.\n\nI've lived for such a long time that there are no words to describe it...\n\nLived isn't really the right word. Existed, perhaps.\n\nAnd yet, of all entities, me, the one who has had the most time to make sense of it all...\n\nI want things to continue.\n\n*****\n\nOne thousand left.\n\nThis job is monotonous... But every day, I get a glimpse at what makes people truly human.\n\nI've never realised how much it touches me deep down.\n\nIf I stay around... How will I cope with the emptiness?\n\n*****\n\nNine hundred left today.\n\nI'm running out of time.\n\nI don't want this Earth to die.\n\nI want to see cities brimming with life.\n\nI want to see marvels of architecture, fresh after construction.\n\nI want to see the rise of civilisations.\n\n... I don't understand what's happened to me.\n\n*****\n\nEight hundred left.\n\nI took pity on a young girl a few days ago. She should have died, but...\n\nI delayed reaping her for just long enough...\n\nJust long enough for someone to find her.\n\nThis is a first. I've never taken pity before like this.\n\nI'm forsaking my duties, but deep down I'm wondering if that's so bad.\n\n*****\n\nSeven hundred people left.\n\nI don't want to let go.\n\nI don't want things to end.\n\nUnderstanding what this feels like firsthand is quite something.\n\nHow could I even feel what death is like myself? The despair? The sorrow?\n\nOnly in this situation could I feel things like that.\n\nIt was so impersonal at first. But now, every time I reap someone, it's like I'm dying myself.\n\n*****\n\nSix hundred people left.\n\nI can't go on like this.\n\n*****\n\nFive hundred people left.\n\n*****\n\nFive... hundred.\n\nI've stopped. I've just stopped.\n\nI can't do it anymore.\n\n*****\n\nFour hundred and eighty three.\n\nIt's not enough.\n\nThe world, it's dying, and I-\n\nEven if I don't reap people, I can't stop them from dying if they just give up.\n\nIf I don't reap them, their soul suffers and becomes damaged.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\n*****\n\nFour hundred and eighty four.\n\nA child was born today. It's a rare sight. The child carries my hope for the future with it.\n\nHer name is Dawn.\n\n*****\n\nFour hundred and fifty nine.\n\nI'm trying my best here...\n\nCome on. Show some will to live.\n\nDon't you know that dying could be the end of everything right now?\n\nAre you so despondent you don't even care?\n\n*****\n\nFour hundred and twenty three.\n\nI've... begun communicating with people.\n\nI didn't know I could, but...\n\nPeople can sense me.\n\nI push them away from danger, and towards supplies and shelter.\n\nThey don't always listen, but it's a start.\n\n*****\n\nDawn is healthy. She is a very sweet child. If I fail, she might be the last human alive.\n\nI don't plan on letting her inherit a dying planet.\n\n*****\n\nFour hundred and twenty.\n\nSomeone... Someone talked to me today.\n\nThey couldn't see me, but they talked straight at me.\n\nNot physically, but mentally. Their heart was open and it showered me in hope and gratitude.\n\nThey didn't think of me as \"Death\" today, but as \"Fate\".\n\n*****\n\nI wonder what it means to be Fate, rather than Death.\n\nIt's not a role I've played before.\n\nDeath is definitely a type of fate. It's my speciality, I suppose.\n\nBut in the grand scheme of things, isn't fate more than that?\n\n*****\n\nDawn's mother is sick. I'm so worried about her.\n\nI hope she survives. It's pharyngitis. It could get bad.\n\n******\n\nI basked in the sun today.\n\nIt's not a thing I normally do.\n\nIt's funny how the things that are most important to you only reveal themselves at times like these.\n\nJust letting the rays of the sun envelop me... It feels so pleasant. I wish I could do it forever, now that I might not have forever to do it any longer.\n\n*****\n\nDawn's mother, she...\n\nShe's going to survive. I refuse to reap her.\n\nI won't let her die of pharyngitis. Not at her age.\n\nTwenty years ago she'd have survived with ease. I won't let it be different now.\n\n*****\n\nFour hundred people left exactly.\n\nIt's slowed down a lot.\n\nA band of travellers have met up with Dawn and her parents. I guided them to her. They have medicine.\n\nI'm doing similar things elsewhere.\n\n******\n\nI'm caressing the soul of Dawn's mother. It's hanging on to her body by a thread.\n\nI'm whispering to her.\n\nI'm telling her not to let this be the end.\n\nShe can't abandon Dawn.\n\nShe can't abandon the last ray of hope on this world.\n\n******\n\nDawn's mother woke up again today.\n\nShe's dazed, but she spoke.\n\nShe told everyone that a guardian angel stood over her, and that it told her not to give up.\n\nShe said I comforted her, and that she could feel that I was brimming with sadness and hope.\n\nShe called me Life.\n\n*****\n\nAnother child has been born. His name is Ercan. Ercan and Dawn live half a continent apart, and they won't even grow up speaking the same language.\n\nBut even so, I hope that one day they'll meet.\n\n*****\n\nThe number is going up.\n\nI'm pushing it up. I'm exerting every bit of strength that I have.\n\nBut it's working.\n\nI was a fool.\n\nI've always been Death because the world needed Death.\n\nWhy did I keep being Death for such a long time after the world no longer needed me?\n\nThe world needs Life right now, and I'm it.\n\n******\n\nIt's Dawn's first birthday today.\n\nI don't stand in the sunlight so much any more.\n\nBasking in the radiating life force of this human being that's the beginning of it all is so much more fulfilling.\n\nI'm not the only one feeling it. Everyone here is.\n\nJust like her namesake, she's crawling over the horizon, a shining beacon of a new future.",

                    "comment": "Wow, this has become pretty popular. I guess I should keep writing.\n\n**Part 2**\n\n*****\n\n\"Life? What was this place like before?\"\n\nDawn stood next to me, and looked me right in the eyes. She was fifteen years old at this point.\n\n\"A metropolis. Millions of people. The most important city on the island,\" I answered.\n\n\"I don't think I can imagine that many people.\"\n\nI thought on it for a moment, but I couldn't find a way to convey the concept to her.\n\n\"Yeah. It's weird, isn't it? There used to be so many. It's impossible to understand if you never saw it with your own-\"\n\nI froze for a second. Now, that wasn't entirely true, was it?\n\n\"Actually... There may be a way to show you.\"\n\nWe walked along the river bank. The weather was calm. Out from the cracks in the asphalt grew new life. London really had changed.\n\nSo had I.\n\nI had always been Death, and it's a job I'd done with conviction. But death and life are tied together in ways even I didn't realise. And so it was that I became humanity's saviour instead.\n\n\"What's that, Life?\"\n\nAnd then there was this girl. Dawn. The first of a new generation of humans. Somehow, she could see me even though I don't exist in the physical world. Maybe it was because I never left her side.\n\n\"Videos and photographs. They're small snapshots of the world. A shadow of what the world used to be like.\"\n\n\"Sounds exciting. Where do we find them?\"\n\n\"I'll need to look around. They're commonplace, but I expect that photos that show London the way it used to be are a little more rare.\"\n\n\"Okay! Let me know when you find one.\"\n\nI paused.\n\n\"Dawn?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"What do I look like to you?\"\n\n\"Oh. You don't know what you look like?\"\n\n\"I look different to everyone.\"\n\nDawn cocked her head.\n\n\"Hm. It's hard to describe. You're... soft, I think. Like beach sand, or a cloud. And you're white like snow.\"\n\n\"I like that.\"\n\nI looked up. The sky was a clear blue. Then I turned my gaze back towards the girl.\n\n\"Dawn, may I tell you a story? It's a story of the old world.\"\n\n\"Of course! Always... Huh? What's wrong? Why are you sad?\"\n\n\"Because, well, I wasn't always Life.\"\n\nI sat down on a rusty railing.\n\n\"You know, one of my tasks is to help people die peacefully. I've done so for as long as anyone remembers.\"\n\nDawn sat down on the sun-warmed pavement.\n\n\"What happens when someone dies?\" she asked.\n\n\"People have a soul. It clings to the body tightly. When someone dies, it loses its grip. But before it does, it disfigures itself. It tries far too hard to hold on. I help them let go before that happens.\"\n\n\"That's a sad job.\"\n\n\"Yeah. When there were millions of people here, that's all they knew me for. They saw me as a skeleton in a black cloak, and called me Death.\"\n\n\"That sounds horrible.\"\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"Looking back, it was, I guess. I didn't realise what was truly important back then. But now I have you, and for the first time, I feel like I'm alive myself.\"\n\nWe sat for a while.\n\n\"What was it like being Death?\" Dawn asked me.\n\n\"Busy. With so many people, I never had time to rest. I carried out my job with ruthless efficiency. I never waited around, or gave people another chance. It kept me occupied, so I didn't realise how lonely I really was... Until one day, I realised I was running out of people to reap.\"\n\n\"Life... Do you think there will ever be that many people again?\"\n\n\"Hm? Oh, yes. I'm here to help, so I'd hope so.\"\n\nShe reached out to me and grabbed my hand. I could see her own hand tremble. She tried to make it look like we were touching each other by holding it up in the air where she felt my presence. I almost started laughing, but it felt so sincere that I simply couldn't.\n\n\"I don't want you to be lonely again. I don't want you to be Death again.\"\n\n\"Don't worry.\" I smiled at her. \"I'm different now.\"\n\n\"But what will you do when there are millions of people again?\"\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\nI remained silent for a while to think. Dawn let go of my hand and stared at the abandoned buildings in awe.\n\n\"Ah, I know. Dawn. From now on, I won't just be there when people die. I'll be there when they are born, too. And when they are facing tough times.\"\n\n\"Won't you be too busy?\"\n\n\"Maybe. I think I'll be able to just about manage. I could use a hand, I suppose. But I don't really have a choice. I am alone.\"\n\n\"You were.\"\n\n\"Dawn... I'm so happy to know you, but you're not like me. No one is like me. I'm the only one who can do this. You... You don't need to help me. I can handle this.\"\n\n\"No one is quite like me either, right?\"\n\n\"Dawn, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I can see you, can't I? I'm the only one who can without having to be at death's door.\"\n\nShe grabbed my hand again. I felt a little pull. Did I imagine it? I pulled my hand away.\n\n\"Life...\"\n\n\"Sorry. You startled me.\"\n\n\"Tell me. How did you come to exist?\"\n\nI looked at the sun. It had begun to approach the horizon.\n\n\"Alright. But after that, you need to collect some water and head back. It's getting late.\"\n\n\"Yeah. That's fine.\"\n\n\"I was human once. It was a long time ago. Tens of thousands of years. My tribe and I were killed in an avalanche. I was able to let go without getting mangled, but when I looked back, everyone was struggling. So I helped them. I helped them let go.\"\n\nDawn smiled.\n\n\"You really are kind, you know?\"\n\n\"Once I had helped them, I found myself clinging to the physical realm. I couldn't let go any more. And yet, it was as if the entire world had become part of me. I could be anywhere. From then on, I never stopped reaping souls. Never stopped helping them.\"\n\nShe stood up and hugged me. I could feel her warm touch and froze up.\n\n\"Wh-what are you-\"\n\nAnd then I saw it. Her physical arms were still hanging by her side. The arms that embraced me were ethereal. Her very soul had reached out to touch me.\n\nThis was the first time something like this had happened. A living human being, able to control their own soul. I realised why instantly. I'd spent so much time with her that it had put her in tune with the soulscape. Human beings tend to focus only on the physical realm. It's what sustains them. Their souls are just baggage. Not in Dawn's case.\n\nI answered her hug.\n\n\"We'll see, alright? You have the rest of your life to decide,\" I said.\n\n\"I won't leave you all alone, Life.\"\n\n\"Of course. Now, let's get going.\"\n\nWe walked home holding hands.",

            "comment": "Only a year ago, I would have killed the woman with a bulldozer. She would have slipped on loose rock, hardhat skittering, and let out a piercing scream. That would have ended her fairly quickly, though. There's a chance I'd have chosen something slower. Trapped in a freezer maybe. Or kidnapped and tortured. \n\nThat's the thing I loved about my old job. I could get so creative. \n\nStarvation used to be a wildcard. Something only used in the less affluent nooks and crannies. Every so often, I'd toss in a doozie, like a pack of malnourished children in the heart of the suburbs. People were always so astonished at what I could slip right under their nose. Now starvation is everywhere. \n\nIf only I could stop it. \n\nHuman life is in the single digits now. Without them I am lost. \n\nSomewhere in all the ash, the woman stumbles atop shaky legs. Up ahead lies a gas station. If there's no food inside, she'll die. I can tell she's thinking of her dead husband. She gets these sort of hiccups each time before she cries. \"Please,\" she croaks, hand outstretched towards the doorway. \"Please give me strength.\"\n\nShe's not talking to me really, but I feel the need to whisper. \"I've told you my secret,\" I say, though she won't hear. \n\n\"You have to hold on.\" \n\nMy secret is this: I was just a conductor. I stood before Death, atop an ethereal pedestal. Together we played symphonies. I basked in the music as we ferried mortal souls. But now Death's music plays on even though I've cast aside my little wand. It sounds to me like a timer. \n\nThe woman is three paces from the doors when she gasps. She screws up her lips in pain. If I had adrenaline to pump, it would course through my veins. \n\nI sweep low to place a bony hand on her pregnant belly. \n\n\"My turn to beg,\" I say. \"Please just a little longer.\" \n\nWhen I was myself, I'd have been near giddy with glee. Pregnancy was an endless well of opportunity. It could go awry in innumerable ways. Now, the thought terrifies me. I've even considered praying.\n\nOnward she stumbles, with me urging from behind. She can barely open the doors. She has become so weak. \n\n\"A little further now,\" I say. \"For all our sakes.\"\n\nAcross the mountains lives another group. I know them well, for they've been whittled down to two: a grisled man and his son. I've pointed them this direction. Really, they're our only hope. That, and the baby being a girl. \n\nI'd have never thought to imagine it: running short of all options. \n\nWords fall short when the woman finds a bag of saltines. She crumbles them in her mouth, closing her eyes, sucking the stale salt and grain. They will make her thirsty soon. But for now they are welcome. \n\nHow ironic, then, that at that moment her water breaks. She gasps in surprise. She runs trembling fingers through the muck.\n\nWhen the contractions start, I tell her she can do this. She shrieks out in agony, and I tell her she *must*. I'm there for each dreadful push, my old purpose flipped on its head. A smear of crimson blood would fill me with despair. Gasps of pain feel like electricity. \n\nWhen the baby is born, the woman is crying. \n\nFor a dreadful moment, it's the only sound. \n\nShe holds the tiny thing up, inconsolable with emotion. Then, sure enough, the baby bursts into tears.\n\nWe'll need to feed it soon. And the others will need to survive the mountain. But for now, I enjoy the moment. A symphony of tears. After a time, the woman holds the baby close and sings a raspy lullaby. Her poor throat is croaky, completely off key.\n\nI find it absolutely gorgeous. \"Sweet baby girl,\" she sings. \n\nChock full of possibilities.\n\n---------------\n\nr/M0Zark",

Given a deliberate and necessary eugenics approach a single digit human population surviving on incest could breed what many elite families referred to as 'pure' genetics. Every so often with incest the genes merge perfectly and you have a, theoretically, genetically perfect human. They'd have to pop out a lot of defective kids before that in all likelihood, and the ethics would have to go out the window in favor of a very literal Spartan approach of most likely leaving them in the wilderness somewhere.\n\nIn short, once women reached birthing age they'd basically be baby making machines, and the mentality of human breeding and sexuality would regress to the original format, and would likely stay that way long after it was no longer necessary. On top of that, even several generations down the line everyone would still be kind of related.\n\nIf you say the mom has 4 more kids by the time the girl grows to puberty, then that girl starts having kids, maybe they could both produce 40 children in a lifetime if that's all they ever did, literally spending the largest chunk of their lives pregnant. At least half that is going to be defective, maybe more. Mens roles will revert to mating, providing food and safety, and to some extent we'd be similar to how insects behave, all parties protecting the one giving birth. By the time you even had 40-50 people in a community, even if none were defective, they'd still all be half brothers and half sisters, and at that point mating would be selected societally by whoever was least related, in order to further randomize genetics. Maybe in another century after that you might have 500 people in a community, and by then you could really start to whittle it down even further but you'd still have very limited genes to work with.\n\nThe numbers are rough and likely inaccurate, and all of this assumes women would basically spend their entire lives popping out babies until they no longer could. They'd probably cull old people after a certain point to conserve resources too. Really got into the societal concept here, I think I went a little too deep.",

            "comment": "My Dearest Friend,\n\nThis last dance was splendid! All this sounds and lights and flames, this is by far our greatest moment so far! I have to say I'm proud of myself on this one, I brought the big guns if you know what I mean. I hope to see you again soon after your well-deserved winter rest.\n\nYours truly,\n\nYour waltz partner\n\n---------\n\nMy Dearest Friend,\n\nIt has been a while since I caught I glimpse of you. I'm worrying I went a bit too strong on you last time... But I know you're still out there since I am still here, so it is just a matter of time before we're reunited once again!\n\nYou will be pleased to learn that our favorite toys have survived. Scattered and afraid yes, but Humanity lives on! It will takes time before they can be of any use to either of us, but I'll keep an eye on them in your absence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nYour longing playmate\n\n--------\n\nMy Dearest Friend,\n\nYour absence is weighting on my heart, yet I know you would berate me or make fun of me if you were here. How far away have I fell from my fearsome days! Yet I can't let our favorite toys fell and rot without you by my side.\n\nYou see, as your creations emerged from the centennial winter, so did a plague even I couldn't design: an unending wave of shambling corpse neither dead nor alive. How those little men who are already struggling against the Nature you designed would have any change against them? So I confess that -from time to time when the situation seems desperate- I took the habit to cut the string of those undead marionettes. I know you wouldn't approve, but they're barely holding together anyway. In a way, I'm just taking back what's mine with a quick snip. Preserving our favorite toys is worth bending the rule a little.\n\nYours truly,\n\nYour apprentice puppeteer\n\n---------\n\nMy Dearest Friend,\n\nI am so sorry! I hope you'll forgive me when we are finally reunited. \n\nThey think I'm you! \n\nAs time passed my little... twists to our usual purview became more and more frequent and humans assumed it was your doing. They even began to build temples to worship the Unsewer. I know I should stop, but the waves of undead only become stronger with time and even if they're rediscovering their past tools, Humanity has still no chance to defeat them.\n\nShould I let events follow their course and reap them once and for all? No! I can't bring myself to do that. I have to protect your creations in your absence, and our favorite toys above all else. It's the only way I can hope to see you ever again. I miss you every day a bit more. Come back to me soon. Please.\n\nYours truly,\n\nYour devoted impostor\n\n------\n\nMy Dearest Friend,\n\nI finally saw you again after all this time. You were hiding in the depths of our last dance scar that humans has renamed Death's Maw. A small group of strong warriors ventured in the bowels of this corrupted place to find the source of the undead plague. I followed them and I saw you. I barely recognized you. You were frantically stitching back together the remnants of the old world to assemble more and more of those abominations that have been endlessly scourging the Earth for so long.\n\nIs that all you're able to now? I miss your beautiful work of old. I miss your colors and shapes and smells. I miss reaping them and seeing them whiter in their own unique way. Seeing you revelling in my rotten leftovers in a vain attempt to recreate the past broke my heart.\n\nI wish I could help you. I wish I could pull you out of this forsaken hole and show you how the world was reborn... but if I approach you we will just dance once again, don't we? My Dearest Friend, I'll be waiting your return. Since Humanity gave you my name, I will don yours.\n\nYours truly, for now, and ever,\n\nLife",

She should not be able to see me. \n\n\nI blinked and moved back. \n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me that,\u201d she whispered. She shuffled onto her feet and dropped her shotgun at her side. \u201cI know you\u2019re here. I can *feel* you. It\u2019s just us.\u201d \n\n\nShe was not meeting my eyes, her gaze landed on my chest. Erica was fire. It was the only reason she had survived this long. Former military, young - but not young enough to be stupid, and no family to hold her back. I found her last winter. She lived in a cave in the mountains, by the mouth of a brook with a bubbling hot spring only a half mile downstream. She did not need my help, at least not as much as the others. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve felt you here before. Following me around,\u201d she sighed. \n\n\nErica was cold today. Her eyes sunk into her skeletal face, framed by a broken halo of hair. Her left pinky and ring fingers were twisted and wrapped with blackened tape. This house did not suit her. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumours about you. Saul told me he saw you last summer when he was sick. He said he was lying there, wishing for it to all be over, and then he felt a cool hand on his back. He told me he thought it was Death, finally here to take away the pain. But darkness didn\u2019t come. He could just *breathe* again, and walked away from his deathbed like it was only a head cold.\u201d\n\n\nErica shuddered. The wind railed against the wall and blew through the shattered back window. \u201cA few years back we were dropping like flies. All of us survivors - people who were smart and capable of living through the first wave - were just falling. Five years ago there were thousands of survivors. I could barely get through a small town without having to hide from looters. And then three years ago I didn\u2019t come across a single person in all of New York.\u201d\n\n\nErica was ice. Her voice rattled in her throat. It was true, though. Even the survivors could not hold back the tides. I am the only one who can. \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s died since the winter before last.\u201d\n\n\nShe was right. A year and a half ago I began to look for them and stood watch over the handful of survivors. I even guided them towards each other. A last hope for them. For me. \n\n\n\u201cSaul said that you were Life. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. Life knows when to let go.\" Erica\u2019s head slumped forward. Her body shook with a sob. \u201cI want to go.\u201d\n\n\n*No*.\n\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, \u201cJust - just let me leave.\u201d\n\n\n---\n/r/liswrites",

            "comment": "It was not often that I looked upon the mortal realm. Living souls on my world were growing ever-abundant, and for each new life, the promise of new death came as well. It was a steady stream of power that I took for granted, certainly enough to keep me satisfied. My power grew each century as the human population staggered upward.\n\nAnd then one day, I felt it. A pulse of power. The colossal loss of life in a near instant. Perhaps a few million souls. Life sat across the chessboard from me, a worried look in his eye.\n\n\"Likely just a large meteor again, I'm sure it will be fine.\" I reached forward to move my bishop, when a felt another pulse.\n\nLife's face was twisted in agony. A series of pulses came, and my power grew beyond Life's as he weakened and I booned. He groaned and collapsed to the floor, and despite my sudden advantage over him, I peered toward our planet in fear.\n\nOnce life and I had been enemies, but even as I hated him, he was necessary for my own existence. For there cannot be Death without Life.\n\nNothing appeared to be striking the planet, yet massive explosions seemed to plague the surface. Not giant meteors, no external energy sources. I closed my eyes and felt the heat of the planet's core. No signs of release or pressure. Volcanic activity was under check. How was such destruction occurring? I used my power to slow time and establish a presence all upon the surface.\n\nThe humans were at war? Yet there seemed to be no battlefield. \n\nAnother pulse. Fire, energy, death. I surrounded the source with my presence. The explosion appeared to come from the sky. I turned my attention to the air...\n\nMetal monstrosities soared in the skies, each one with the power to snuff out more lives than the greatest war. What had the humans done...\n\nWith a clench of my fist, I erased the terrible weapons. It drained much of my newfound power, but I could feel the slow, painful deaths of those around the world. 85% of humans had already perished. I need not worry about lacking in power this day.\n\nI followed the gaseous trails they left behind to facilities of iron and steel. The humans there had caused this destruction. They had the audacity to complain at the malfunction of their weapons. Why had they done such a thing? What good could come of such massive death? Even the plants and animals would struggle to survive this.\n\nThey burned from the inside-out at the wave of my hand. As their souls left their bodies, I snatched them. Few had the honor of coming to my realm.\n\nI looked upon the surface of my world. Once, this sight would have brought upon a smile on my lips. Now, I thought of what would become of Life.\n\nI found him frail, bloodied and dying. He was unconscious, and in such a state he could not use his power.\n\nI felt myself begin to panic. I had great power now, but it could only destroy. What could I do? Where would I begin?\n\n***My first prompt! Usually I write drafts of plot and go back to fill it in a bit more. Let me know if you like the ideas, at least.",

            "comment": "In the heart of the dying world, I sat down and watched them. Power wasn't going to die anytime soon. The physical laws of the realm had never slipped, only the mortal's grasp on them.\n\nIt was only a matter of time, though, before even those laws were devoured, shoved into greedy maws. Released back into the entropic chaos of the universe. Feasted upon like ravenous carrion, skin split open like balloons.\n\nBut that was not what bothered me, for those things would happen after I myself had passed on, and it was the nature of all things to die.\n\nAnd yet...\n\nI reached out with a thing hand, skin so pale and paper like it merged with the List that cradled my body, and infinite expanse of ink that not so long ago had seem truly infinite with it's billions of names and gently brushed the sad little bush growing in the corner of the bunker.\n\nIt didn't have a name, but... it didn't need a name. If it were named, I would see it and eventually have to take it. \n\nI had a partner once, not terribly long ago. It was nice to be remembered back then, deified. Dozens of me in dozens of different places.\n\nThat fractal had been stolen from me, and I missed it.\n\nBut not enough to forget my solemn task. My fingers flicked across the bush, and I killed the blight growing on it's branches. Death took the individual cells and robbed them of their time, sending vitality back into the plant, and speeding on the journey to the end of another species. Then I withdrew the list the had burrowed its way into my fragile paper skin and ran my fingers down it. Hours. Minutes. Seconds. Days. Years. Billions of names. Everyone that had ever lived. Everyone that was yet to die. It took far too long to reach a name that was not scratched out.\n\nAnd then I stepped out of the shadows on another shadowed bunker, where the power had gone out. I could hear the shaking of many bodies, cowering in the darkness.\n\nAnd one soul that had decided to not cower, but stare at me in wonder.\n\n\"So you've come for me, have you?\" The leader said, their skin blemished with age, cancer, poison, a thousand different causes of death, interwoven in a bizarre tapestry. My right eye saw fate. My left eye saw nothing but the quirk of their lips.\n\nMy head slipped to the side.\n\n\"Yes, I can see you, pale one. Do you speak my tongue still?\"\n\n\"I do,\" I said, slowly. \"Have you come to bargain?\"\n\n\"Bargain?\" The leader laughed, their eyes alight with something like amusement, but bitter, deeply so. Like the bushes that had died in africa, too many years ago, or the brushes the tigers had played in greater asia, when death swept through again and again. \"There's nothing for me to offer.\"\n\n\"There are always such things to offer,\" I said, pleasantly.\n\n\"Not to a dying world,\" they said, plainly. \"There's nothing left that I can do for you.\"\n\nI blinked. Slowly, so that fate flickered across my eyes, the gently tugging and whirring of those beautiful weavers. Where had they gone? Another world? Spun their own way into an escape? What pleasant sunny place had they found, where the skies were not choked with ash and burning clouds? Did I miss them too?\n\nI did.\n\n\"For me?\" I said. \"There's nothing wrong with me.\"\n\n\"I saw you once, decades ago, when you came for my mother. Your skin was gleaming and polished like the sun, and radiant,\"\n\nMy right eye flicked back through fate. Dozens of years taken back in a second, until I saw their mother's name sketched up and marked through, in a hospital, with the sun outside, and bizarre music playing, cake, candles, wind. Did my fingers drift across her hair like the card in thread, or did it drift across the child, watching in the corner, who knew that I was there?\n\n\"And now you are as pale as I am. What has happened to you? Have you grown old?\"\n\nI stared down at my hand, then slowly twisted it until my wrist ached. How long had I been bound to this world, trapped in the incalculable twists of fate.\n\nHad I once had volition, or was I created for such a role? and when I died, where would the role go? Would there simply be nothing left? Would I appear again when life appeared? I...\n\nThere was nobody left to ask. How many names had been crossed out on my paper armor. How many names were left on my paper skin, and how many times would I cross them out in my own blood before my veins finally ran dry?\n\n\"There's nothing I can offer you. The power's out, and my temperature is dropping. Soon, my children will join me.\"\n\nI stared at them for a long moment, then turned away. Man defined fate and meaning. They always had but... what good was meaning now? And yet...\n\n\"You will owe me greatly,\" I intoned.\n\nTheir face stiffened slightly, then went into a slack, joyful grin.\n\nThen I drifted through the halls of that dying compound, hand out stretched. Fate had deemed that this bunker die, and plunge the whole of Russia into the domains past this. And yet... when was the last time I had seen another psychopomp. Where was the Reckoner? The Masked? Where were they now, in the infinite fractal?\n\nOr were they gone just as I was, with their skin of paper and fire, knit with ink and dressed in their sunday bests, buried deep in the ground, where nothing could touch me again?\n\nMy hand found the generator and I called upon the great conduits still left in the world. They had blinked out, one by one, as the hunger had taken them, each one a scream. Something I'd taken.\n\nCould it be that in the end, the laws that had chained me for so long had also died?\n\nLeaving just me and the handful of life left around the globe?\n\nBut a single conduit answered my call. New York, perhaps, buried in it's central park. Coherence and meaning kept them chained, from the few survivors who had left.\n\nAnd then the bunker slowly whirred back on, powered from afar by the crossing paths.\n\nHeat flooded the bunker, and the dying leader smiled as the shaking slowed, then stopped. Life had been saved. Peace had fallen into their hearts.\n\nAnd perhaps, hope, for the first time, settled upon them like atomic ash.\n\nAnd in the sky, cloaked in ash and darkness, there gleamed a single red star of the war god.\n\n-----\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Zubergoodstories/ for more like this, try here!

I want to die!\"\n\nDeep below her there lay jagged metal spikes, the remains of an insurance building mostly destroyed by a nearby atomic blast. \n\n\"Lizzie,\" I said, using the term I knew her mother had used before she succumbed to radiation sickness, \"You're not alone.  There are others.  Trust me, keep walking, and you'll reach the settlement soon.\"\n\n\"I'm crazy,\" she cried, tears falling from her eyes while trying to wriggle from my grip, I was limited in what I could do.  If she wanted to die then I couldn't really stop her.  I found out that I could change their minds though.\n\n\"Elizabeth Darlene Simmons,\" I growled, cheating by using her mother's own voice, \"Did I wander the wastelands for you to kill yourself?  Did I fight off those mutants for you to just waste your life?\"\n\n\"M-mom?\" she said, her struggle lessening, \"I want to be with you, mom.\"\n\n\"You can,\" I continued using the voice as I slowly began pulling her up, only because she was letting me, \"But not now, Lizzie.  You have to live.  You have to find the others - fight, live, raise a family.  Mankind must continue.\"\n\n\"Why, momma?\" she asked and the question struck me like a fist.\n\n\"Because,\" I said with her voice, then I switched back to mine as I answered truthfully, \"Death sucks.  There is nothing beyond.  Only darkness and nothing.  I should know for I guide the souls to the door and have seen nothing beyond.\"\n\n\"Who are you, really?\" she asked, and to my surprise she allowed me to pull her to the top of the cliff fully.\n\n\"Death, child,\" I said, \"I am the personification of Death.  I am... afraid.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Lizzie said, her eyes narrowing as she held my hand tighter now, \"I won't let go. Not as long as I have a friend.\"\n\nI relaxed and held her hand.  Together we walked across the barren landscape toward the waiting settlement.   For some reason I wasn't afraid anymore.",

            "comment": "Lily, if I were to have continued my old work she would have been dead by now. Found by her friends and family.  Would I have had her kill herself? I may have even had her get hit by a public bus.  But that isn\u2019t the new me, now I have to make sure these people survive. There use to be so many people that I had the privilege of deciding their fate, most people would have been appalled if they had to do what I did. But now with a little over 200 people left on this planet I must keep them alive. My life depends on their population not dying out.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few years since the bomb that wiped out 99% of the human race went off. At first I was continuing my job of killing people but I soon came to realize how weak it was making me. When the population had dropped down to about 50 I was barely able to keep my self in this realm. Without my help the humans were able to get a little bit more population and my energy has slowly returned. I am nowhere close to how powerful I was but I don\u2019t currently need to worry about disappearing. I\u2019ve had to make it my new goal to make sure these people survive as long as possible. \n\nThe people know very little about me, they seem to react to my presence which I assume has to do with how weak I currently am. They gave me a name of \u201clife\u201d but if only they knew who I really was.\n\nLily is my current target, I sense her life will shortly end but she is only 34 years old. I am not able to foresee their exact deaths but I can do a little bit to help them. I notice up ahead there was a few trees. I counted 4 people working on collecting lumber for new buildings and they were working on a huge oak tree. Lily was right in the path of the tree about to fall.\n\nAs they nearly finished cutting the tree I made a very small root come out of the ground and trip Lily. She fell face first into the dirt and I felt slightly sorry about causing her pain. \n\nI\u2019ve grown soft since I\u2019ve taken this new role and I hope once the world is back to a stable state I can return to my old life.\n\nThe tree fell with a loud crash directly above the spot Lily was going to. I heard a faint \u201cthank you\u201d as Lily got up and brushed off her knees. \n\nThis is how my life\u2019s been these past few years. Helping people and hearing them thank someone they can\u2019t see makes me feel sorry for them. Sorry that I was the reason all of this happened.",

            "comment": "A shadow hung over Hope as she wandered through the rubble and ruins of what remained of human civilization. With every step she made, Death followed closely, watching her with his never-blinking twin pits of darkness. \n\nHope shivered, and for a moment, the cold breeze that had slipped down her neck felt... *alive.*\n\nDeath watched as Hope pulled her hood, a ragged coth, over her head and cinched it tighter. Warily, Hope continued down the worn road. Cracked and weathered with time, it stretched into a ruined city, its name lost with the passage of time. Most of the buildings and towers had toppled over, but some still remained standing. They leaned and hung precariously in the sky, threatening to topple with only the slightest breath. But the world was barren, lifeless and silent. There was not a single soul, not a single breath to be felt, except for one girl by the name of Hope. \n\nAnd Death was there when she was born. He was there because there were two lives for him to take. \n\n----\n\n\"Come on Clara! Almost there!\" the man shouted, his voice resonating into the silent grey sky. \n\nThe man was on his knees, his hands ready to receive a new life and behind him stood Death. \n\nClara had cried and screamed for hours through the night, and when the sun finally rose, there was silence. \n\nClara had given birth. \n\n\"Its a girl... Its a girl, Clara!\" the man cried as he wrapped the baby in a blanket. \n\nBut Clara didn't respond. \n\n\"Clara?\" the man crawled forward on his knees. With one arm cradling the baby, he checked Clara's pulse. \n\nDeath had taken Clara. \n\nThe man had cried as he realized this. Then he stopped himself when he noticed that the baby wasn't crying. \n\nDeath had watched as the man began to panic, shaking the baby gently when she didn't respond. Then putting his ear to her tiny chest, the man listened. There was no heartbeat. Only the sound of his own breathing could be heard. \n\nDevastated, the man had screamed a raw and guttural cry. Despair had settled into his own heart, and the man was ready. Ready to meet Death. Still holding onto to the still-born baby, the man clutched a knife and brought it to his chest. He would plunge it directly into his own heart. \n\nDeath saw this. He saw that with the man's death, there would be no life left. It would be the end of Death. \n\n\"Wait,\" Death whispered. \n\nThe man flinched as he heard Death speak, and thought it was the wind, but there was no wind, only a cold merciless mist. \n\n\"There is still hope,\" Death said.\n\nShocked by the words, the man had dropped his hand to his side, the knife still firmly in his grip. \n\nDeath bent down, low enough that his breath could be felt on the baby. *It's not too late*, Death thought. Death extended his bony fingers, and touched her heart. Then there was a heartbeat. It was faint but it was there. *All she needed was a little nudge*,  thought Death. \n\nThe baby let out a breath, then breathed. Then she began crying, wailing loudly into the silent world. \n\nThe man dropped his knife as he smiled, then began laughing. He was overjoyed. \n\n\"Thank you. Thank you Lifegiver!\" the man cried. Then he looked down at the baby. \"Your name is Hope,\" the man whispered. \n\nDeath stood up, straightening his back as he watched. Today he had given life, and now in his hands, he held hope. \n\n-----\n\n\"*Life*, I would kill for some canned peaches,\" grumbled Hope. \n\nIn her hands were canned beans. She had stumbled her way into an abandoned supermarket. Now she was stuffing her bag full of canned beans as she continued onto the next aisle.\n\n*Hopefully, somewhere within this barren world, there were canned peaches*, thought Death. \n\n----\n----\n\n/r/em_pathy\n",

            "comment": "How strange to think that the Lord of Death would grow tired of itself.\n\nWhen the War first began, I had set to work as I always had during times of great conflict and plague. I searched out each victim as I felt their lives expire, collected their poor lost souls, and brought them to their new home. It was just another war, I told myself. For a short time, I almost believed it. \n\nBut on some level, I knew it was more than that. I\u2019d learned that lesson during the last big one, though I\u2019d tried so hard to forget. It was never just a war. My job was to escort the poor lost souls from this world to the next. As the Lord of Death itself, I exist wherever life ends, and nothing ends life quite like a war. Contrary to popular belief, I never steal life. I never take what it not rightfully mine. Or at least, that\u2019s what I used to think.\n\nSo many lives ended in that old war. I had been everywhere at once, in the same place hundreds of times at once. So many souls had cried out to me to take them away from those horrors, and I could do nothing but wait. The souls came to me when life ended, and I led them to their new home, all the while waiting for the other souls that would surely follow. There are countless lives, but there is only one Death. I do not weep for the dead, for that would only be useless self-pity. I do not feel sadness anyway, not in the way the mortals do. But\u2026I think that was the first time in my existence that I felt truly tired. Life ends suddenly sometimes, and earlier than it should. That has always been the Way of things, and I am not one to question the Way. But that\u2026it was just too much.\nI had hoped \u2013 foolishly, I knew \u2013 that another war would never come. But war was the way of the humans. There were so many of them, wanting different things but also the same things. I had tried so hard to deny its inevitability. I know they did too. We were all fools. \n\nIt had started suddenly, though its coming was hardly unexpected.  I think that was the worst part; at some point, all those souls had silently accepted my coming, and lived for so long knowing I was right there, over their shoulder, or waiting for them around the next corner. For many of them, I looked them right in the eye before I took them away. I looked them in the eye and I stole their life away. I, Master of Death, who always swore I was no thief, stole the lives of millions in a day. And I stole the lives of hundreds of millions more in a year. Within two years I had stolen billions. I wept for none of them. I wished I could.\n\nOfficially, I don\u2019t think it ever ended. I took most of their leaders, after all. There was no one left to make that decision. Those that remained had other worries now. \n\nTheir souls still came to me when I found them, as they always had, and each time I was amazed. These souls were strange, to say the least. Each era of life was different, the souls each greeting me differently. In the age before humanity, they hardly greeted me at all, were hardly even aware of my presence. The souls just before the War had felt no fear when I came to them, often greeting me coldly, as if they had expected me to come for them sooner. During the War, the souls screamed in terror at the sight of me, as wartime souls often did. But after, the souls I guided ran to me like lost and frightened children searching for their parent. As if I was a refuge. \n\nI couldn\u2019t understand it. It was not the Way of life to desire Death. There were always outliers, sure, but never this. I couldn\u2019t stand for it. There were too few left, and I needed them to continue my own existence. There would be no need for Death if there was nothing living left to die. For the first time that I could remember, I feared my own existence. If all life ended, I would end as well. I, Death itself, did not want to die. Something needed to be done.\n\nI didn\u2019t change all at once. I stopped coming only to those whose souls were leaving this world, and began to visit those whose lives were about to end early. I had never taken an active role like this, and I did not want to interfere too much; much as I feared myself, I still worried about upsetting the Way of things. At first I only helped those dying of infectious diseases, humans whose frail bodies could no longer fight off the bacteria or parasites that had invaded them. I used my power to end the blights infecting plants that humans and remaining animals needed for survival. They were still dying of viruses and the effects of the irradiated landscapes, but at least now they would still have food.\n \nI thought just doing that little bit would be the end of it though. I didn\u2019t anticipate the feeling that I could \u2013 should \u2013 do something more. I killed the diseases before they killed them, and before they killed their food sources, but I couldn\u2019t escape the feeling that it wasn\u2019t enough. I didn\u2019t want to upset the Way of things, but I could no longer simply be Death and let their souls come to me. I had to do something more. So, I started killing the cancerous cells that grew in their bodies. \n\nIt was strange, killing an organism\u2019s individual cells. The microbes that sometimes killed larger creatures did not have what I would strictly call a \u201csoul.\u201d I could feel the life in them, but it had no thought, no feeling, no awareness of itself; it was simply possessed of a driving need to survive. However, these cells, while still not really having that soul themselves, contained a sort of imprint of that soul, like the distant echo of whispered voice in an empty room. I shivered with each one I snuffed out.\n \nI could not do much to help those infected by powerful viruses, seeing as my power had little effect on something with so little life in it. It aggravated me, but it was simply the Way of things. I wished I could do more for their lives, but at least their fellows could care for them, and I helped keep them as healthy as I could.\n\nLife slowly began to adapt to its changed world. New generations had been born, and maybe one day there would be those who could survive in this poisoned world without my help. How long that would take, I did not know. But it gave me some comfort. I resolved to continue helping them wherever I could.\n(*continued in comments*) \n\n",

                    "comment": "I didn\u2019t realize how much I had changed until the day I met the first soul who neither ran toward me nor tried to flee. His eyes met the eyes of whatever image he had of me, and held them with a dignity I had not seen in generations. I was stunned. This wasn\u2019t the cold acceptance of the souls before the War, and his gaze wasn\u2019t seeking comfort in the way of the souls after the War. I wasn\u2019t even sure I knew what to call that expression.\n\n\u201cGuess my time finally came, eh old friend?\u201d\n\nI was stunned. He spoke. Some human souls did, if they weren\u2019t overcome by fear. Usually it was to express surprise at their death, or disbelief at seeing me, but this? He didn\u2019t just speak, he *greeted me as a friend*. The only ones ever to do that were the ones that wanted me to come for them. And I had always made it clear to them that I was anything but. \n\nYet this man had not wanted me to come. He had survived the short, intense battles of the War, the harsh wasteland and famine that followed, the plagues that struck down millions until I stopped them. He would have fought cancer to his last breath had I not saved him from it first. He was not a man who had sought out death.\n\n \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know any better, Alexander Mills, I would have thought we had met before.\u201d My voice creaked, or at least I\u2019m sure he heard it creak. Mortals often seemed to see me as a skeleton or an old man, and heard a voice to fit that image.\n\nAlexander Mills smirked. \u201cOh, something tells me we have. Cancer doesn\u2019t just \u2018go away,\u2019 after all. And it\u2019s not like I had access to a hospital then. My daughter\u2019s recovery was just as much a miracle.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what to say. It had been a long time since I had spoken more than a simple greeting and lead a soul silently away. I had disrupted the Way of things by saving people. I was the god of Death; the living weren\u2019t supposed to thank me.\n\n\u201cI suppose I should also thank you,\u201d Alexander went on, \u201cFor saving my daughter. By all rights, that lung infection should have killed her. But she lived, and somehow our family managed to find happiness in that wasteland.\u201d \n\nI couldn\u2019t stay silent. \n\n\u201cWhy are you thanking me?\u201d I asked him. \u201cI may have saved you then, I may have saved you daughter then, but in the end, I still came for you. I will still come for your daughter.\u201d \n\nAlexander nodded, more somber now. \u201cYes, I suppose that\u2019s true. But you know, if not for you, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to have that extra twenty years with my family. My daughter wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to meet her husband, and my grandson would never have been born. It\u2019s a shame he won\u2019t get to have many memories of his grandpa, but I treasured every day of my life with them after you saved us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you so convinced it was I who saved you? I am Death; I\u2019ve stolen away countless lives through the ages. It\u2019s not my job to save them.\u201d Those words felt like a lie as I spoke them. I\u2019d been saving lives for almost thirty years now. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be my job to do, but I had made it mine.\n\nAlexander shrugged. \u201cI suppose I can\u2019t know for sure, but I do know that somehow, despite all that we humans have done to the world, a few of us have still held on. We\u2019ve beat the odds too many times for it to be just luck. Someone\u2019s been interfering on our behalf, and I think that someone is you?\u201d He gestured toward me, and began to approach. \u201cWho better to stop death than Death itself?\u201d\n\nI thought a moment. Perhaps he was right. For so long, I had simply been a cold observer, leading souls to the next world when it came time for them to pass on, as I now led Alexander Mills. In the wake of the apocalyptic War which they had waged upon themselves, I had come to know a little of the deep fear the mortals had of me. In the slowly recovering wasteland of a world, life now meant so much more to its inhabitants, and too me.  There is, and ever will be only one Death. That has always been the Way. But who is to say that that is all I am?",

As a black crow picked at the remains of a corpse on his front lawn, Dan reached back into his cooler-chair and grabbed another cold one. \n\n\"You want one? Or are you still 'gluten' free,\" muttered Dan.\n\n\"I can't believe I'm stuck at the end of the world with my ex...  \" muttered Genivee. She was a beautiful woman. Was. A failed young marriage and a career and a half later, she looked like a woman whose best days had left her. \n\n\"YOU HEAR ME DEATH? FUCK YOU.

Or maybe Death doesn't have any pronouns.\" tendered Genivee. \n\n\"Does anyone give a shit?\" fired Dan. \n\n\"Give me the goddamn beer,\" returned Genivee. \n\nDan chucked a can to Genivee, who, of course, dropped it. She was never great at catching things. The can rolled toward the corpse to the crow. \n\n\"You didn't have to throw it that hard.\" said Genivee.\n\n\"I didn't throw it that hard,\" retorted Dan.\n\n\"You totally chucked...\"\n\"I threw it normal\"\n\"Throw it normal, what does that mean...\"\n\n\"WILL YOU TWO SHUT UP?\"\n\n\"What did you say to me?!\" \n\"I didn't say shit, there you go again, always accusing me...\"\n\n\"HELLO, DOWN HERE!\" \n\nThe crow turned it's head and waved it's little wing. In a flash of light, the crow and the corpse disappeared, and, out of nowhere, appeared the Mick Jagger dressed in an all black suit.  \n\n\"HOLY FUCK! MICK JAGGER?! I LOVED YOU IN THE BEATLES!\" screamed Dan.\n\nAfter a dumbfounded glance, Genivee studied the Mr. Jagger and carefully asked, \"who are you?\"\n\n\"Please allow me to introduce myself. I'm a man of wealth and taste...\"   \n\n\"Wait, isn't that a Rolling Stones song?\" asked Dan. \n\n\"Good Lord... I'm Death, you nitwit. I figured I'd at least dress in style to meet my new subjects. A more familiar form, no?\"\n\n\"So, can I have your autograph?\" returned Dan. \n\n\"God, I can't believe you and I had sex... Sorry, mister, um, Death? Subjects?\" asked Genivee.\n\n\"Yes. Subjects. You two are the last humans alive, and, well, per Eden Protocol 101, I am to keep you alive so you can procreate. Or else I shall be eliminated. Rather ironic, no?\"  Death said with a smirk.\n\nGenivee, dumbfounded, turned and vomited onto Dan's half dead lawn. \n\n\"I thought you might like that, Genny. You Mortals seem to think Death and Life are separate, but you were all rather mistaken. Well, except the Buddhists, they got it right. But, if you asked me, they lived such rather boring lives anyway that I daresay I can count that as living\"  laughed Death.\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Jagger. I'm a little confused. Are you saying that we are like some sorta Adam and Eve or something?\" asked Dan earnestly. \n\n\"Well done, Daniel,\"  applauded Death. He picked up the Rolling Rock and, with a snap, the can turned into a martini with a black olive garnish. \n\n\"Surely, there must be some mistake... how can we procreate if we hate each other? Aren't there other couples that may be better suited? Barack and Michelle? Kristen Bell and Dak Shepherd? Hell, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West?\"  pleaded Genivee.\n\n\"Others? Who better than you two? You two fit the bill, perfectly. Oh, and don't call me surely. Did I do that right?\" snickered Death. \n\n\"Fit the bill? Of whom?\"  asked Genivee.\n\n\"Of Adam and Eve. You two are splitting images of them.\"  answered Death. \n\nDan and Genivee gave each other a flabbergasted look as if each were trying to see if either could be the Father and Mother of man. Dan took his hands and began to protect his ribs. \n\n\"I'm not taking your ribs, you fool. Besides, you have too much fat on them anyways...\" sneered Death. \n\n\"How are we like Adam and Eve? Weren't they kind and welcoming parents?\"  asked Genivee. \n\n\"They HATED each other.  All their bickering.\" laughed Death.  \"And that family was a disaster. One of their sons murdered the other?! Hardly great parenting don't you think?\" \n\n\"Why do you thinkhumankind was such a disaster? All the fighting and killing and sex. It was truly rather entertaining watching you little humans hurt each other so. I had them entertained for eons! But it got old and you mortals blew each other up anyways... So think of it as a... reboot of sorts...\" gleamed Death. \n\nHe finished His martini and then snapped his fingers. A California King drapped in black satin sheets appeared. \n\n\"We're ready for you two to start whenever you\u2019re ready.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I'm not usually this grandiose but I believe I severely overestimated how grounded they kept me, all those souls I encountered, roughly 1 every 5 seconds coming to me exiting this world and a new soul being granted a shell every 3 seconds. These days I'm lucky to find a soul a week and births have become so exceedingly rare that I sometimes wonder if I will revert soon.  You see something like me is sustained by the passing of that rare electromagnetism called the soul. All creatures have one and every time they pass it filters through me and spins the appropriate wheel and keeps the appropriate gears turning. My evolution to this point was mainly predicated on the fact that the human psyche has influenced me so much that I've become somewhat human myself, At least my mind but now I can feel the souls of the bugs outweighing the human and somewhere in my deepest recesses I feel a clacking,chittering growing mind, barely aware but learning. If something doesn't change I fear I will become an unthinking abstract again. \n\n\nToday I was seen by a man with a child. My mind is beginning to regress, they shouldn't have saw me at all but it's hard to keep focus when the chatter inside gets this loud. I suppose that could also explain what happened next. The man begged for water and help. I am death, I am the Malachhamavet, I have watched so many souls beg for anything imaginable within the human experience, I never helped any of them save for the way I universally would and could anyway by touch of my embrace and that sweet ending they so often expect to come with a bang when the reality could barely be called a whisper. I was never cruel, I was never kind, I was the true neutral and I went back on millennia of no interference for this one man and one child. \n\n\nThe small canteens of water saved them from this desert. Everywhere is a desert now I suppose since they dropped their bombs on each other. When he asked my name I did not lie and he only thought I was half crazy for saying such a thing. Three days later he came to me with a question, I know such things are important to humans so these were called henry and Diane respectively. \n\n\nHenry asked me \"how I had so much water when I carried no bag or gear on my person.\" \n\nI told him\" he already knew the answer\" \n\nHenry responded in a queer way, he broke down on his knees crying which greatly upset his tiny companion. Henry said \" if you can do that than why don't you help?! What's stopping you? If God gave a fuck wouldn't he be here too?! Please if anything happens to me take care of Diane. She's got no one besides me.\" \n\n\nI looked over to the small one named Diane and I made a confession. \" As long as you remain in my company you will not die, nor can harm be done to either of you.\" \n\nHenry stopped crying for the first time in minutes after hearing that. He just stared and said \" thank you, thank you, thank you.\" I lost count of how many times he said it and I felt a feeling of pity for these creatures as they lay here dirty and half mad from my revelations. \n\nI needed a moment to myself so I went to a nearby hill to gaze out to the wastes before me not so unlike the void from which I myself was birthed. That's when I heard the shots. Three humans, two males and a female had entered our camp which sadly consisted of some simple sheet metal arranged in a box and a Fire. That was when I felt the two souls sublimate into my being but I put them back in their shells and in but a moment I found myself face to face with the three that had tried to cheat death out of his company. I felt it may be counterproductive to reap the three so instead I simply reached into their minds and left them as blank shells. Marionettes really now, hollowed out and ready to receive what will be given. \n\nI did another thing for the first time I had once sworn I never would. I brought three souls back. The mother of Diane, one of Henry's brothers and a random decent soul I found screaming in the void. The reunion was a strange one filled with my speaking of how they were back as much as it was filled with tears of happy reunion. Something else too, Henry's brother and the one I found screaming felt incomplete and soon expressed why. They missed the others they'd lost and in that moment I found myself missing the ones gone more and more. After much thought I'd decided I would find indecent souls and reap them but do what I did here and replace them with the decent ones that were lost or in time find a way to create life myself. \n\nDiane has grown on me tremendously, I fear what my presence does to these beings though and fear my acts repercussions on them even more. They've taken to proclaiming me their God, a titles neither want nor can accept, Diane has taken to calling me life and that makes me feel the emotion of joy more than it should. That's why I've decided once it's built up enough to continue on its own, this new society, new humanity we are building is stained by my touch will be rid of me. Since I cannot die being an abstract entity and all I will divide myself amongst the remainder of life on this planet and universe with the majority of myself inhabiting henry and Diane. \n\nThere were always meant to be two of us. Even abstracts know loneliness once they gain sentience. Myself and the one called God were such once, she so beautiful that even now I see her in every facet of creation. The Big Bang they speak of was her death, a necessity for this universe being born. She split herself into everything, that was the moment I lost my light. All the stars born from her could not begin to equal what I saw and felt with her and so I will sacrifice myself to save her creation. My recent actions have made clear I cannot simply watch anymore and the kind of power that resides in me will eventually SnapBack and do as much bad as good I have accomplished in an effort to balance the scales. \"This is the only answer Diane, you know everything I do, you are everything I am. You are the new scales, the new balance.\" \n\n",

The silence, which I used to find comforting, now made my bones quiver. I missed the bustle of the crowds, and their awful jokes. I missed the smell of food, and the fresh scent of spring. I missed their tales, and I missed so much more.\n\nSo far, I had found a single family alive. I hadn't searched too much, for I had focused my efforts on taking them to safety.\n\nThey called me Life, and it suited me. They couldn't see me, nor hear me, but I had guided them with a path of stones to a cave in the mountains, where I left them with enough food for two weeks. Then, I came back to the city, seeking for life.\n\nSix days had gone by, and all I had found was wreckage, dry blood, and the thick reek of radioactivity. There had to be more survivors. I had heard the rattling of those weirds creatures hunting.\n\nI sighed, and sat atop a pile of broken boulders. The night was deep, and the moon shied away behind thunderclouds.\n\nSomething tugged the back my robe. It must have gotten trapped inside a crack. It happened a lot, for it loved to billow. I pulled it free, without success. I turned.\n\nA woman stood there. Her skin was jaundiced and she had no hair. Her jowls were sunken, and her extremities were extremely thin.\n\n\"Help me,\" she said. Her voice was soft and fragile.\n\nI froze in place. She could see me? How? She was still alive. I couldn't taste her soul. \n\nI placed my scythe atop her head, and it shimmered iridescent. The countless colors bathed her in a gleaming shower of light, and once it faded, her skin had recovered her natural tone, pale-white.\n\n\"Is there anyone else contaminated?\" I asked.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"How did you survive alone for so long?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said, mouth quivering. \"I don't know what is happening. I-I just woke up. Am I dead?\n\nThat didn't make any sense. Had she been asleep for an entire year? Why didn't the radioactivity kill her?\n\n\"No, you are not. Follow me,\" I said. \"I will take you with the others.\"\n\nThe rattling of approaching steps resounded in the distance. The creatures were coming.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n/r/therobertfall - For more stories. I might continue this later! \n\n         ",

            "comment": "Death often found themselves reminiscing about those times. Work had been easy and plentiful. Their ears fluttered when someone\u2019s end was\nnear, they quickly flew over, and before the victim knew it their soul was now in the\npossession of the Repear himself. He often complained that there was too much\nwork for the little time he had in his days. \n\nNow, he wished he could do anything to take back those words.\n\nNuclear annihilation had been a constant threat to humanity\nfor almost a century at that point. All it would take for one insane leader or one\ndesperate dictator to set them off and kill the world. Ironically, the world was\nat its highest level of peace on a millennium when it happened. But humans are\nnot perfect, and just the slightest error in missile\u2019s code could give a\ncompletely different command then planned. Unfortunately, other countries did\nnot forgive that mistake. \n\nWhen the ash settled and the humans finally crawled out of their\nvaults, 1,220 human were still left on the planet Earth. \n\nAt first death simply continued as normal. Someone attacked by\nmutants? Wait for the inevitable. A man fighting off scavengers? See who would\nwin. He was sure that humans would eventually jump over the hurdles and\nrepopulate the planet. Maybe the job would even be manageable now, he smugly\nchucked to himself. \n\nThat was the plan at least. \n\nDeath realized more and more how fragile of a species\nhumanity is. When necessities are nearly non-existent and the environment is this\nhostile, humans are completely defenseless. Every year their population would plummet\nby 100 until there were only 300 left. Death began to worry. God told him that\nif humanity were to ever fade, he would with them. What if he kept true to his\nword?\n\nDeath would have no other choice. \n\nIt was a women with their two children. They had been\nhuddled in the shelter for three days, starving. There was no more food left,\nand their life from their eyes was draining by the second. \n\nWell, this was a better time than ever. \n\nMaterializing in front of a human for the time in his career,\nhe reached out and offered them a loaf of bread. \n\n \n\nMaking part two now.",

They talk and reminisce about \"the old days\", and they talk about a day that will never come.\nYet, I somehow admire there hope. It's also rather falsely placed. I forgot to mention. I also learned a couple of emotions recently. Boredom was one of them.\nGood thing they keep things... Interesting. ",

            "comment": "\"Fear not death, for till the time comes death is the protector of life\" - Saying from a South Asian Warrior Tribe. \n\nFor millennia I had been a reaper of souls, the dark one, the entity that the world feared but grudgingly accepted. Il Muerte, The Grim Reaper, Maut and countless others, every language ever spoken had a name for me. A name always remembered. Trillions upon trillions of souls I had ferried from their bodies to their judgement and yet here I was looking at my own end. \n\"For an immortal you aren't all that\" I said to myself with a dry chuckle. \nI had had a great last few years, the wars to end all wars was actually a war that ended the world as mankind knew it and I had a great time. My power was at its peak, I was reaping souls in the millions everyday and then it ended. There just weren't enough humans left in the world to fight it anymore. \nThen I noticed something, as the time passed and my reaping was limited to a handful a day, my power waned. It was like Il Muerte was getting old and that's when the realisation hit. My power was directly related to the number of souls I harvested. The scythe grew rusty in my hands as the humans progressively decreased. \n\nThat's when I thought of my end and saw it was near for Death can only exist as long as there is life. \n\n---------------------------\n\nThe man sat and waited, it had been a few days since he had eaten something warm and now the roots and bugs that he had found sustenance in were depleted in his domain. So he sat near the watering hole praying to a God that didn't listen for food. \nAs he waited, I watched, sending out tendrils of thought looking to find some meat for this haggard soul. I sensed a beaver nearby, I teased the Beavers mind slowly drawing him closer to the watering hole. The man heard the underbrush breaking under the Beavers fat tail and he tensed holding onto the rock hoping, wishing, praying. The beaver came into sight and adrenaline coursed through the man's veins. I could smell his hunger and desire. The beaver was cautious, looking around, sniffing the air and I was getting bored of it. I squeezed the beaver's brain, killing caution and it leaned forward to drink. The man had been waiting for this moment. I saw the hope in his eyes as he threw the rock at the beaver's head, his aim was true but malnutrition had taken its toll the rock bounced off the head and the beaver ran as the man broke into sobs with thoughts of killing himself. I reached out and snapped the beaver's neck. As the dust settled the man saw the dead beaver lying on the ground as I moved away to find another life the last thing I saw was the blood running down the lips of the man tearing into the raw flesh, his blood pumping and strength flooding his veins, offering his gratitude to God and Life. This one would live for me to reap another day. \n\n--------------------------\n\nThe little girl child burnt with fever, the mother trying to keep her cool put leaves soaked in water over her forehead. Every few hours the body of the little girl would be racked by spasms, the mother was trying all that she could but deep down she knew that the girl barely had a chance. Between bouts of fever the girl would lie there half dead, breathing but not moving. In one such bout the the mother lay her head to the ground calling out to \"Allah\" begging pleading  for respite. When none came she renounced her God screaming profanities at him. The girl was getting worse by the hour and the feverish episodes were getting closer to each other. The mother had seen people die from this fever hysterical and spasming. A long drawn out scream of frustration and helplessness left the mothers throat. \nAs I passed by I reached into the girl and reaped the bacteria that ravished the little body. \n\nThe last image I saw as I left was the girl opening her eyes and calling out to her mother. Colour coming back to her cheeks and the mother silently crying paying her respects to Life. This one will bear me others that I shall one day take. \n\n------------------------------\n\nThere were others, as my power waned I kept them alive and they grew. Mankind was always resilient, they grew bouncing back from the brink of extinction. \nSurviving, slowly forming communities, growing, they would talk to each other about their exceptionally long lifespans and how living off the land had made them strong and how Life had been kind to them.  They grew back to some semblance of a society and then it started again. As they became bigger greed and lust took over. The bigger they became the more it effected them as people. \nTwo tribes, they broke out into war over hunting land. \nRallying under torn banners, war cries ringing, they marched to battle  \n\nI watched, almost at the end of my time, as the front lines charged towards each other, landing blows with primitive weapons.  Human blood was spilled and I felt it rush into my veins as my lips split into a smile a laugh started deep in my being. As I swung the scythe, the only thought that I had was. \n\n  If it lives. It will die. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

As the fire consumed most of the world I felt a power wash over my form as no being had ever experienced. Back then death brought me joy, but no longer, no there was only...something. Slowly as the years dragged in there were fewer and fewer humans, and for the first time since they had taken that first bite of knowledge, I lost power.\n\nAt first I reveled in their demise, I made games of how to end them. I made one group eat each other as the cold of winter creeped into their bunker, others died in massive pits consecrated to MY glory, but something changed. Where before I had no trouble finding a new plaything, I now have to search, there\u2019s barely any now and I feel....well, me at my doorstep.\n\nBOOM!!\n\nDamn it...I don\u2019t remember causing that....it\u2019s like I\u2019m fading without them...like I need them to continue...I need to end this, it\u2019s gone too far.\n\nI cast my senses over the world, desperately searching for a sign, any, of human life, but all I find is death and destruction.

I lean done, my emaciated hands outstretched to pick her up, and I realize why her life feels so familiar, we had met before, at the beginnings of my existence.\n\n\u201cHello Eve\u201d, I crone, my voice calming the baby girl, her brown eyes meeting the black orbs in my skull as she smiles up at me, \u201clet\u2019s find your Adam, shall we?\u201d\n\nAs I walk out of the ruins where Eve was born, my mind is alight with possibilities, maybe soon I can return to my old hobbies...death will never find me so long as she lives.\n\n\n",

My first memory, and my true birth, was at the creation of Eve, and the breaking of Adam's rib.\n\nWhen God created each new life, every new child under his two creations, I felt a holy pull towards the Earth. I felt a pull towards each human, towards every dancing breath and work of art that nature spun.\n\nIt was a weird thing to be reborn as death. That first culling was also to change me, and God knew my first touch after death was to be the love of my life. It took whatever good I felt and tore it out in cruel lobotomy. And then, pleasure. Sweet sweet pleasure at the memory that could never be sullied and the sweetest relief. Sweet sweet relief, and sweet pleasure turned to lust. And when the flood came, avarice.\n\nI loved killing. The souls became a leisure to take. I swept the grains and became powerful, and everywhere. With millions of people I was a God.\n\nMy mind reached far, far into the future. I could predict the final destination of any being, small or large, and soon after I became able to cause it. I spent millennia carving rocks and moving seas, all to cause distant catastrophes. I set up wars and watched civilizations burn each other with inventions I helped create.\n\nMy scythe never stopped swinging.\n\nWhen there became billions of people, I had a grand idea, the best in many years. I was going to depopulate.\n\nAnd so I did. And I fell in love with a new art. There was Deus ex Machina, and even more deliberate, me.\n\nI gave them a free year, too. Just to watch the symphony unfold.\n\nAnd then it all happened. Not just one war, but dozens. Disease. Mania. A machinery so precise that every bullet fired was a kill. I watched the natural floods and the man-made wildfires meet and my ears danced at the sound of the screams. Pure ecstasy.\n\n*Cough*\n\nWhat.. was that?\n\n*Coughgck*\n\n...\n\nBlood?\n\nThe rush snapped out and I felt it. Every death. Every scream. I felt tangible. I was no longer everywhere and I was AFRAID.\nWhat is happening?\n\n*HckCoffCougjjh*\n\nI forgot what it felt like to feel a single death. India, 23 years old. Suresh Patil. I could feel the fear as he was pushed and I could feel the sound his head made when it met the pavement. I could feel the loss of beauty.\n\n****\n\nFour years ago, and now there were 526..\n\n253 of them are on remote islands, or faraway places. They will have no chance, no matter what I do. But I still watch. I am forced to watch them as they travel hundreds of miles on nothing but bugs and will, knowing exactly when they will die. As I take their hand, I will apologize.\n\n113 in a town. They chose to call it \"Miracle\", a place untouched by death. But really, it was I who created it.\n\nMy knowledge was the only thing that hasn't yet left, and I knew how to play with causality. I painted smells in the trees that would draw the animals, of which the men would follow. I diverted rivers and made them flow to this town on the sea. I created an earthquake to separate it from the wild ocean but still allow for fish.\n\nThe 160 others have all but gone mad. I am afraid of them, for they have started to see me. They look behind them when I am there and they share my pain.\nAll but a handful have the same delusion - they call me life. I know why. I whisper in birds' ears to lead them to shelter, food, whatever. I've had to beg, but I've gotten the squirrels to drop blankets near the cold. God has not spoken, so I have taken his place.\n\n****\n12 years.\n\nMiracle is a misnomer. There are now more effigies of me than there are humans.\n\nThere are 32 effigies.\n\nThey have almost given up, but they know that I am near. The noises on my ears are now prayers and not screams. It's nice. I have no regrets. I have led them as far as I can, and scavenged every burnt store and ghost town alongside them. They talk directly to me sometimes, and although they can't hear me I do answer. I am no longer a single being, in one place, but multiplicitous in the hearts of the few that are left. I have begin to orchestrate events far into the future again. I do my best, but I am still getting weaker. I look down and there are only hands and a scythe.\n\nI find myself kneeling down and reaping another. They won't last long, and neither will I.\n\n****\n\nI have done everything I can. I have orchestrated every opportunity, recruited every beast and insect, put light in every path to go. \n\nThere are two now, a man and a woman. Or rather, two and a child. Their time is limited.\nFrom all of my efforts, they will have five months after the child is born. They have both become sick, but don't know it yet. When I approach, they become as terrified as I am.\n\n\"Life,\" the one asks, her hand thumbing a small carving of a snake on a cross, \"Why were we chosen to live?\"\n\nThey were not. I am not a God. Mother Nature was Queen, and her fates spun that they both could live the longest. They were not 'chosen' to live. \"You were chosen to die,\" I whisper. I hate the monster they called death.\n\n****\n\nI have named him. The one sole survivor of this beautiful, reforming world. Every fiber of my being goes into protecting this small boy. I have sent him teachings of the past, of good and bad, and of the future he could have.\nI love this boy. I won't last to see him grow, but at last I can be patient.\nHe is older now. Seven years. I'm unsure if he understands why, but he knows that everything works for him in this world. I am on my last legs, but finally, I have that feeling back. I felt a pull towards him. I felt the beauty in his every footstep and the sheer awesomeness of nature's golden thread. My memories flushed back from my birth and I remembered what my Father had done for me.\n\nI went to Adam, afraid and alone, and while he slept I took a rib.\n\nWith my scythe, the only part of me left, I cut it in two. I created Eve, and my son. A part of me that would last beyond this and be willing to be a part of the beautiful world to come.\n\nGood luck, you three. I love you.\n\n\n",

A small pack of them, dead humans with spirits latched on, moving the bodies like puppets.  And there were others unattached spirits moving with the pack.  It was small enough number that should be easy to deal with.\n\nThe cloaked figure rose from the shadows and spun his scythe around before stopping it with the pole behind his back and the blade curving farther back. The Spirit\u2019s and by extension their puppets turned to look at the cloaked figure. It charged them, spinning the scythe and taking out one of the spirit\u2019s chain to the possessed body, it dropped. The bony hand holding the haft of the scythe twisted in a way no humans could and brought the blade back around to block the spirits attack, a grouping of hooks they were trying to use to possess him with.\n\nThe blade continued on and sliced the threads holding two more of the corpses up. The unattached spirits hissed being able to do nothing until someone or something was hooked. That could only be done to humans by the puppet corpses. On this side, the spirits already hooked to something could reach out and hook another for another spirit to control. The scythe spun and cut. In mere moments every puppet lay crumpled before the cloaked figure. The puppeteer spirits fleeing the area, to find another set of puppeteers so they could affect the living world again. A scream was heard and the cloaked figure spun to look at the two living human\u2019s it had come to observe. \n\nIt was to later for the larger one, another puppet he had missed had hooked the human. A spirit was attaching itself to the line. The cloaked figure moved.  The scythe flying through the air, it was to later for the hooked man, but the other one had a chance. The blade sliced through the line just as the spirit gained control. The soul of the man sat up, looking terrified. He looked down and then back up at the black cloaked figure, then at the spirit controlling the puppet it looked down at him. As it readied to cast it hooks out the scythe came back severing that spirits\u2019 connection to the puppet.\n\n\u201cYou are the one that has helped us to live.\u201d The soul said after a moment of looking at the cloaked figure.\n\n\u201cWe have helped with dealing with these abominations, but so few of us remain and they group.\u201d The gravelly voice of the cloaked figure said as it glided to the soul. \u201cSo few of the living remain we reap as it is our job, but now we reap more than you.\u201d The empty skeletal hand reached out to the spirit and opened invitingly. \u201cEternal rest is now an option for you.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s soul reached up and touched the offered hand, then was drawn to the beyond. The cloaked figure stood over the weeping human who had just bashed in the head of her former travelling companion. Death stood over her watching and waiting.",

            "comment": "Life? There is no such thing, the concept is an acquiescent notion as a result of my handiwork. Akin to how a shadow only exists where there is light, life only comes to be when death is ubiquitous, where without such a thing, just to *be* would not be such a strange notion. They hail me as some divine deliverance, but if only they knew how much better off they would be without me. I am nothing but a parasite upon their existence, formed by opportunity and sustained by ignorance. Yet me being aware of such details helps no one, for like any other animal, I place myself above all things and cannot help them *truly*, for such a thing would be  my own doom.  \n  \nWhen there were many of them, trading their existence for my own was not something I thought much about. For my own subsistence, it was what had to be done. Stopping to think about how one is breathing is not something done too often, but that air was thin and depleting and now I must be conscious of my actions. I am not able to avoid ruminating on the subject... one wrong misstep and their doom means my own, so our goals just happen to align in this sense.  \n  \nJust as they are conscious of my mannerisms, I am conscious of theirs. Throughout history, I could not help but familiarize myself with their thoughts, languages, and cultures. It was a thing that helped my craft\u2013to be sure\u2013but to do what I do without understanding the subject would be foolhardy. A few of them surprised me, and I even attempted to befriend them at some points, but breaking my code would be true evil. My indiscriminate method is a result of the relativity of morality. How could I choose who lived and who died? True, I have the power to do so, but not the ideals, nor the absolute knowledge to devise such a system. The dead young, old, and good of society are due to my own failings to establish an absolute moral compass. They must die because I do not fully comprehend them, and my avarice forces my hand regardless.  \n  \nIn this crumbled society, they may see my restrained actions as a source of life, but they needn't forget that I am death.",

I just have this long wooden stick now. The blade disappeared...I dont know, three, four years ago? Its so hard to tell time anymore. Flowers and plants have started to grow from the edges of the top where the blade used to be. This robe is getting hot, too. It used to not be like this! I used to know what my purpose was in this world. I was the Black Kiss. The Grim Reaper. *Death*. And now...I dont know who I am now. \n\nThings are so unfamiliar. I have existed for an eternity, more than an eon. People *feared* me for all that time. They would pray to their Gods that I would not take them or their loved ones. I would take anyone I pleased, whenever I pleased. The Harbinger, they called me at one point. Yesterday, I saved a kid from falling out of a tree. Little guy could have killed himself!\n\n*What am I saying???* He could have killed himself?? Isn't that my whole thing? This isn't me! I don't understand it anymore. I see less and less of them now, since the Big Take. Damn, that was a busy month. Clocked in at 3,034,478,205! Personal record, for sure. Those were the days... Oh my God, that one is about to accidentally set himself on fire, son of a bitch..\n\nThey are so clumsy! I dont think I ever noticed that before. It was just business as usual. But goddammit if these things don't seem to look for trouble around every corner. And why so fuckin fragile? Whichever God made them, they played some sort of sick joke, I tell you what. All these vital organs that are essential to keeping them alive is held together by a friggin flesh bag. Terrible design.\n\nToday, something weird happened. A little girl..saw me. Like, she *saw* me. Waved at me and everything. She said \"look mommy, its Life!\" The mother couldn't see me, but I could tell she could feel me just the same. And neither were afraid. Neither cowered at my presence. Instead, the little girl ran up to me and tried to *hug* me. Did you hear what I just said??? She tried to *HUG* me! But the weirdest part of it all was...I didn't try to stop her. In fact, I instictively held out my arms for the embrace. I *wanted* to hug her. Don't get me wrong, I have hugged plenty before her, but all those people died when I hugged them. I hugged them for that purpose. And now, I just want them to stay around. I like them. \n\n....*Life*. That's what I am now, I guess. I don't really know now anymore. All I know is I kind of...I don't know....*love* these creatures now. Its as if they leave for good, *I* leave for good. Its like we need each other now. Maybe thats how it is. Maybe I do need them to exist. If that's the case, then I can handle this strange new look I have now, this odd skin that has grown over my once white and dry bones. I think I can handle it. \n\nI just want to find that little girl and give her a hug soon. \n\n",

            "comment": "I had seen it. Many moons ago. I saw the mushroom clouds before there was even a member of was among the humans, for I see all things, and pay special interest to those events related to my duty.\n\nBut this time was different, this time I foresaw the final end to the human race. The initial blasts killed of 90% of the population immediately. 90% of the survivors were killed by radiation, nuclear winter, or suicide a short while later.\n\nI saw that in a short 50 years, the small tribes that remained would be killed off, either by natural causes, or by the beasts that came from the irradiated zones.\n\nAt first I was pleased, finally, my job would be complete, but then I reflected in the words I heard when I first came into being. \"Today marks the first human birth, on the day of the last human death, you will cease to be.\"\n\nI began to feel something new. I was afraid, my whole existence revolved around the mortality of humans, but I had never contemplated my own mortality before. I began to panic, terrified at the concept of non-existence. Finally, I came to a decision. I knew that I couldn't interact the the humans directly, but I was able to influence them and the physical world to some extent. I determined the locations of the last remnants of humanity and set to work.\n\nI fought with every fragment of my being to help humanity escape their demise. At first, I only guided them to ensure their survival, sometimes I would whisper into their hearts to warn them of impending danger, giving them time to escape natural disasters, and the wasteland beasts. Other times, I carefully influenced their scavengers, leading them to undamaged caches of food, tools, and weapons. In time, I was able to bring the remaining tribes to stable population counts, but it wasn't enough. When I focused on their future, I saw I had only delayed their end for a short time. \n\nI changed tactics, I arranged for two of the largest tribes to encounter each other, and made their minds more open to open, peaceful discussion. Within weeks, the tribes were in agreement, and they joined together to pool their resources. Humanity began to rebuild, the tribe became a kingdom, gradually expanding, peacefully small scattered groups all the while. I carefully monitored the people of the kingdom, gently guiding them away from harmful actions. When supplies were scarce, I ensured that cooler heads prevailed, and prevented unnecessary bloodshed.\n\nFinally, I saw humanity had a chance at real recovery, I began to step back into the shadows, but stopped when I noticed something curious. There was a large gathering of people in the middle of the kingdom. I approached to investigate the disturbance. I heard murmurs of a celebration of a benevolent force, a being that had pulled humanity from the brink of total destruction. The called it \"Life\". It took only a short time to realize that they were referring to me. \n\nI felt suddenly sickened by my actions over the preceding decades. It was true, I had abandoned my duty for fear of my own demise! I had become the antithesis of my very purpose!\n\nFor a while, I contemplated, should I return to my duty? Allow humanity and myself to cease existing? Staring down at the beings that I had fought so hard to save, I realized that I couldn't bring myself to do it. Instead, I pushed forward. Humanity would no longer just survive, I would make sure they flourished once more.\n\nIt took time, but I gradually began to influence the greatest minds of the new age. I pushed humanity first to the age of reinvention. Humanity rediscovered their lost secrets at a staggering pace. Medicine, transportation, communication, all brought back to nearly pre-war levels. But it wasn't enough, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel, a truly bright future for humanity. So I continued my work, I taught them secrets that pre-war humans never learned, thrusting humanity into the future! Finally, I saw my goal realized. I watched to first clinical trials of IMM-42, the immortality drug. \n\nI turned my gaze to the future and saw... Nothing. I felt a chill run through me, and first words I heard, the words that were etched into my very being echoed in my ears. \"On the day of the last human death, you will cease to be.\" Not, when humanity dies, but when the last human dies. If allowed the humans immortality, it would mean the end of my own. \n\nI admit, for a brief, desperate moment, I considered sabotaging the trial. I knew that if this one failed, they would waste time and resources trying other paths. But, as I thought about this, I realized that I couldn't take this away from them. I had stopped fighting for my own existence long ago, and had grown rather fond of the people of this new world. So, I stepped back, and watched humanity make its greatest discovery.\n\nIt wasn't long before the new drug began dispersing throughout the populace. There were holdouts of course, but most were more than happy to accept the offer. Gradually, I watched the holdouts die off, as more and more of the population were inoculated from death. Finally, I stood by the deathbed of the last holdout. He had lived a long life, by pre-IMM-42 standards, and he was surrounded by family and friends who were all begging him to accept the injection. He vehemently refused, \"everyone has their time, and now is mine.\" he croaked. Finally, tearfully, he left this world. I dutifully guided his soul to oblivion, just as I had billions of times before.\n\nI felt a tug at my own spirit, and I knew that my time had come. I stood above a sprawling field and pondered for a while as I began to fade away. In my absence, humanity would thrive, I was certain of it. They would build beautiful cities and monuments, they would travel the stars and colonize distant planets, they would certainly encounter some of the other inhabitants of their vast universe. Theirs would be an empire that would never end... and I wouldn't be there for any of it. I felt a single teardrop fall at that thought. Still, I had done all I could for them, I knew they didn't need me anymore, and I would only hold them back if I tried to stay. With that thought, I released my hold on existence, and let death die. An errant thought gave me pause, \"If all beings have an aspect of death to guide them to oblivion, who guides the aspects of death?\" Then, I was no more.",

He stopped wondering about what would come next, and focused on the warmth. \n\n\"You know, I think I had a pretty good run.\"\n\nOnly because I made you.\n\n'And I'm glad you did.'\n\nThe living curse of Fear, ancient impetus, was no more.\n\nSoon, the man died, at peace.

After ages of bringing people to the other side, the looming darkness that was death, death for the first time feared himself. \n\nWho shall Reap me when the time comes?\n\nWatching the small crowd of people that remained in this desolate wasteland, I felt a small pang of hope. They were beginning to grow self sufficient again. I had done my best to lead them to greener pastures, but that was the problem. The greener pastures were hard to find, hard to discover. \n\nAfter all these years as death, the nature of it was ingrained into me. I wanted to kill them, burn them, watch them starve. But, the fear of my own demise was far more daunting than the pleasure of watching these people perish. I have prevented numerous babies from dying of illnesses that would have killed most any. Diseases long gone had returned to no avail, sickness was no longer a death sentence as it once was. They had absolute life, for I would not kill them. They were growing privy to it.\n\nWhen the Great Plague hit, that was my moment, my ultimate glory. The pleasure of taking life, watching it fade from the dimming eyes of all. Well, almost all. I fear for the first time that I may have gone too far. The Black Plague was the last time that I had let myself get carried away. I knew, I knew if I let myself loose once again that it would be disastrous. A mistake, it was a mistake. And now, I must fix it. \n\nThey have begun to notice me and the guidance that I have offered. Life... the new name of I, Death. I am the unexpected pastor. I am still unsure if that they will not die, they have counted their blessings and thanked me, Life, for their fortune. It was not me, but my absence that they felt. They knew it was their time to die, but I did not come do give them their release.\n\nOh, to Reap this last group though, yes, that will be true satisfaction, true bliss. To exterminate and bring death to all. I... I need to, calm down. I need to squash this bug of death within me and foster Life. No, am I not complete if I bring these people my ultimate satisfaction?

She had a gaping hole in her belly from a sharp object going in, which had gone about rupturing many organs. Her wound was infected, and her body ailed beyond help. The power death had over pestilence had worn out. Now, nature ran itself. As the barely conscious woman brought herself to look at the pitiful being in front of her, one that had been watching over her family and the last remnants of humanity for nearly three hundred years since the beginning of this mess, he looked upon her as well. \n\n\"It's alright, I understand. I know your feelings of betrayal. I caused this. It is my fault. You should not have had to die for that. Not you, not your brother, not your father or your mother...

Death looked up at the heavens above, tears running down his bony cheeks. As he took a final look at the world he had created, he smiled a sad smile. \n\n\"So it did not matter. It is ended.\" \n\nThe last human soul was taken to the heavens. The bringer of death lay on the ground also, the force of his life bleeding out. Those last words echoed in Death's mind.\n\n\"*You are life to me...*\"",

Katie, sonny, Jake, and 4 children are gone because of your stupid decision!\" Another says. I understand why he is angry though. Those people didn't deserve their deaths they got, I could have killed them less painlessly, if I was stronger. But with there being so little humans left, its not easy to make cardiac arrest just happen anymore.\n\n\"Listen, Paul, I know your mad. But I think we got better odds now, I don't know why its just a gut feeling\" jonny says. He is right. They have better odds now because I am going against my code and helping them. Their gods are ethereal just like me, but I will find a way to kill them, to make them pay and suffer in their demise as I am made to suffer and die.\n\n\"Oh that's rich. You got what? 6 people and that's the best you can do? A gut feeling? Peoples lives are in jeopardy and you got gut feelings?\" Paul walks off. He is going to gather the few people he can and strike out on his own. I sigh, they will become adversaries. A small group broken smaller... I don't have the power to stop them from leaving. With so little humans left, and them being separated like this makes me nigh powerless.\n\n\"Well... You with me?\" Johnny asks the other people. They did their heads, unsure what to say to what just happened.\n\n\"Let him cool off Jon. He will change his mind if we bring him something to eat.\" A woman says. She doesn't know it yet, but she is pregnant. The future of mankind literally is with this woman. \n\n\"Thanks julls. Alright lets get going!\" Jonny says as he jumps into the front seat of a vehicle. They begin to speed off. And for a while they forgot the situation they were in. Driving fast down the road, singing silly songs, and the two girls dancing to an unknowable beat. I too forgot the situation. It was blissful. \n\nThe speed, the carelessness... Oh how much fun I could have! But something brought me back as I could foresee the truck flipping over, the man jonny is going to fall asleep as the girls and the guys flirt and talk about idealistic things and not pay the driver attention. The gods are going to crash the truck and kill everyone.\n\nBut I react now, grabbing the wheel, jonny falls asleep, but I keep the wheel straight. One girl finally notices and slaps him awake, and I let go, he doesnt seem to have noticed my intervention.\n\n\"What the FUCK jonny? You trying to get everyone killed?\" The pregnant woman screeches. \n\nJonny slows down and stops. He gets out, and pukes. The human body isn't capable of handling being toyed with by gods apparently. \n\n\"It wasn't me, Julie I feel fine. I was awake and then suddenly I wasn't. But nevertheless, did you guys notice anything?\" \n\nOne guy says \"you were asleep right? But the truck stayed straight. I work on this baby all the time, so I know she pulls to the left, we dont have the parts to replace the bad column. That's weird how it suddenly stayed straight\"\n\n\"Really? Never noticed\"\n\"Nope\"\n\"You smoking?\"\n\nThe four look back at the guy who spoke first. \n\n\"So what? You think gods are helping us out all of a sudden?\" Julie says \n\n\"No, its more probable that something else held the vehicle straight. The gods are trying to extinct us, remember?\"\n\n\"Ill bet that's why barfbag suddenly took a power nap.\"\n\n\"If not gods then what could have? Spirits? Good luck?\"\n\n\"Definitely not the spirits, man, I've seen some in action and they are nasty pieces of work.\" The second man says.\n\n\"Alright jonny, ill take over.\" Julie says as she slides into the drivers seat. \"You get in the bed and try to not throw up everywhere.\"\n\nAs she sped off I couldn't help but \"smile\" at the notion how their conversation was perfectly acceptable. Only a few short years ago and this conversation would have taken place in an asylum.\n\nThey reached their destination, the city. A plethora of toys, instruments to demise a being with. The gods will try something here, I could sense it.\n\nThen the foresight came. A skyscraper will lose its battle to gravity, and win against them.\n\nI quickly shut the vehicle off, mustering energy from my consciousness to stall the truck. As the truck coasted and the passengers freaking out, the skyscraper fell, landing harmlessly in front of them. Julie slammed on the breaks, astonished. The two guys and girl were taken aback as well.\n\nJohnny slammed against the truck window, rubbing his head. As the people got out of the truck.\n\n\"That's twice in an hour we were saved from certain death by an unexplainable source. What could it be?\"\n\n\"Could it be life?\" Julie says as she rubbed her stomach, suddenly aware of her little fetus growing.\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous. Life isn't a thing!\" Jonny said quickly dismissing it\n\n\"Jonny, consider the fact that gods are actually real. And trying to kill you. Would it be so hard to accept that life is a real thing? You just saw how we survived two certain things that have no real explaination.\"\n\nJulie looks to jonny as he gets out of the truck, and spits blood on the ground, \"at any rate\" he says, ignoring Julie. \"We aren't going this way, maybe 'life' could open us a way so we can get food, and not starve to death?\"\n\nI find these humans amiable. I get another foresight. This time it is some creatures made by their gods, they are called beta voidlings. Individually they are little more than nuisances, but in large numbers like they are in, they become very powerful.\n\n\"Hear that? Jonny there's betas coming!\"\n\n\"I see them coming from the west street!\" \n\n\"Jenny, start the truck! Jimmy grab a rifle and get in the bed of the truck! Julie you need to get in the truck and lock the doors and windows!\" Johnny yells\n\nI shake my head. I focus my conscious into the truck and start it without anyone inside it. All 5 of the humans are shocked, scared, and very very grateful. \"Thanks life!\" Everyone says as they get in the truck and speed off.\n\n\n\nSince then, anything good that happens to a human is considered a gift from life, and anything bad is considered a curse from god.\n\nI sigh, as I stand in front of these people and they don't know that I really am just death.\n",

These mortals, that I so abruptly ended their existence in the past, never seemed to affect me. Never has there seemed to be a connection between me and these... these insignificant specks in this magnificent universe. Until now.\n\nThey've wasted a unique opportunity. Wasted a gift like none other. Their petty fueds of race, religion, patriotism... Hell, even their constant lack of care towards others they're close to is still astounding to me. I used to relish taking one from their happy little world. Now, though, now it's taking a toll.\n\nNow, it's killing me. Me! How did my existence get entagled with this mess of beings? Their numbers have dwindled. Less than a million left. Each one I take now has a price. I'm fading with each soul I reap. Weaker, slower, less in touch with the Cosmos. I even feel pain now! Pain! How? How! It was just a word they would use!\n\nI've become so desperate now that I try to save some. It's selfish, I know. But hey, I can't let them kill me as well. I'm not ready for that. They still keep trying to kill each other. Still try to eradicate their species. If I wasn't tied to them... I'd let them. Assholes. I have to get creative to keep them alive, keep myself alive. They've even started calling me Life. Ha, Death becomes Life. Life.\n\nSuch a thing is precious. The Cosmos doesn't do it often, and most often it's not a thing of beauty. It's just unaware, unintelligent things that only want to reproduce. Humans, though, were different. And they squandered it. I have to preform miracles to keep them, and me, alive.",

His emerald green eyes widened.\n\n\"It literally just flew off you.\" He said.\n\n\"Told you I can't die.\"\n\nHe rummaged around in his a blue pouch wrapped around his neck. He took something out in a fist. I couldn't see it, but I felt slightly comforted. I knew what he had in his hand. I knew a lot of things though. Especially if they helped me a few times. I hope it killed him, maybe something with a bang. Like a grenade. \n\n\n\"Eat this\" he said, shoving a pastel green cube into her hand. It was on the tip of my tongue. I knew that cube. She popped it into her mouth. And I remembered. It was mainly arsenic trioxide and coloring now. But the moment she ate it, it all came flooding back. All the children that are it on accident. The cults in the last decade that sought the rapture with it. I remember the lost animals and pets died from it. I remembered how humans discovered it in ancient Egypt. And how they made it, through their species span. I remembered how they used it to kill rodents. And how much easier it made my job for me. I remembered the chemical pathways it traveled. The vibrations it affected in space, and the undulations in time, is caused. So snuff out a little bit of the spark. I remembered everything there is, everything there was, and everything there will be about rat posion. And the moment she closed her mouth, I changed it into sugar. \n\nPadma choked. She spat it out, reflexively. Into his face. He took a finger, still sinking in quick sand. But ever. So. Slow. If he went slow enough, maybe he would die. I'd have taken that. A joy in watching even this idiot die. But he wasn't shittin' slow enough. She was only supposed to spit it out in two dimensions. And there was gonna be almost no glorious consequences for her. No water into wine. No impervious to cuts and bruises except on a heel. No magically reinforced bones. No being able to move mountains. No regrowing organs. No walking on water. If he was slow, he died, she lived, and the whole event would be so inconsequential. It would work without him. I knew all about him in that moment. Just like the rat poison. But the cards never got dealt in my favor anymore. In two stupid realities, she spat it out. And I knew in almost every timeline, he wasn't slow enough. He took his finger, wiped the goopy, spitty, sugar, and ate it. Swallowed. How I wish I could just turn it back into rat poison. But since Padma was born, I couldn't alter reality to hurt others. I could only alter her reality. And I saw everytime, when I let her die, or helped her die, or forced her to die, it went blank. Then we went back to the moment she died and I changed it so she didn't. I remembered the blankness. I died too. We caught on pretty quick. It took me a whole Yuga, to catch on. Or so it seemed. She was 1 then. It only took her till age 4 to understand it too. But by four, I managed to pack in a lifetime of hurt and misery. It made her timid, but it also made her frightfully smart. She was smart enough to know that she couldn't die. Shouldn't die. And that made her brave. Sometimes. So this idiot, swallowed the sugar she spat on him. And didn't die. Then he smiled at her. And then his eyes flicked, incredibly. Into mine. Then back on her. It was almost coincidental. Like a micro-flutter of his eyeball. Or a sign of seizure. I prayed it was, hoping he would die. But dreadfully, He bowed, ever so slightly. And he told her.\n\n\"My name is Kal. I lied, I do need your help. I need you to jump into this pit. Grab onto me. I'm pretty sure we won't die\"\n\nAnd I gasped. Because, it was then I truly knew him.\n\n",

            "comment": "Twenty they were. Strewn across the broken ashes of the world. Humans and their petty squabbles, always fighting, always stealing, always killing each other. The death counts came by the billions, and that gave me a work backlog that took near months to finish. But a thought had crossed my mind, should the last human fall, once the last soul has been dealt, what would be left for me? \n\nNineteen they were. Another soul had to be judged, and sent to heaven. Time was ticking, I began my flight towards the survivors who were more likely to come across each other. At most there were four of them. It was near the broken ridges of Vancouver, the snowy mountains in the distance replaced with a glowing hum of radioactive residue. One by one I found each of the last humans in this city, through the last remaining shambles of sky scrapers, in the desolate and frigid streets, the subways entrances that didn\u2019t cave in, under a bridge near the deep red waters. I gave each of them the strength they needed to move, I guided them, subtly at first. Eighteen they were. But then I had to force my hand. Three men and one woman here in the once bustling city of Vancouver, and I had gathered them to one place.\n\n*\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know there were survivors,\u201d A man with a gristly expression exasperated. He almost looked like a bear with how much facial hair covered his face and body. \u201cThe name\u2019s Samuel.\u201d \n\nThe others appeared reluctant to converse at first, but with the night rolling around and the nuclear winds arriving any moment now, they soon realized that at least together there was a chance of survival. I noticed a small patch of growth in the parking lot basement where the four had settled and decided to call home base. I stretched out my hand, a small plant began to grow, this will have to do for now. If they last a few more days they will find some food. Seventeen they were. I had to come back at a later date, as I visited the other remaining survivors across the world. Sixteen they were. They were too spread far apart. Fifteen they were.  One more soul transported. Fourteen they were. No there had to be another cluster like the one in Vancouver. Ten they were. I felt four souls pass. I shivered, for once I was afraid of myself.\n \nI flew as fast as I could back to Vancouver. To my surprise they were still there. Samuel, and the other three, they had set up a pipe system to provide them water, they scrounged together enough gas tanks to boil the water to help cleanse it of bacteria. I took a quick glance to the patch of land I had revitalized. There was a small garden there, was it self sustaining? I should have known those four souls were all in different locations, I panicked. Nine they were. Another soul gone. I had given up on the others, really, and spent most of my time watching over the group in Vancouver. Eight they were. The last eight Humans on the world. Where ever the other four were I would be there to guide their souls. \n\nMonths had passed without another death, this gave me ample time to reinvigorate the four survivors I was watching over. Much like the strength I gave the plants, soon they began to glow, and felt stronger. I believe they felt my presence as well. They had set up a small religious altar on one side of the parking lot. They, began to pray? In all my eternity as death, never has a human once praised me. I chuckled at this. \n\nSeven they were. I was confident enough in the group that I personally went to deal with this soul. Humans, I began to reminisce, power hungry, greedy, cowardly beings. But there is yet a hope for them. I looked up to the sky, I wondered how the other angels are dealing with this tragedy, and then I glanced to a pit below where a live volcano was spewing green lava. I also wondered how the devils were reveling with delight. Six they were. My wings kept flying, it was my duty, I had to help these souls pass on. Five they were. I couldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of regret, I couldn\u2019t help the others like I did the Vancouver group. It would have been too much for me to attempt to sustain all of them across the world. Four they were. This was it. With that I began to fly to where the last human had died. It was at Vancouver. I my bones shivered. I ducked my head down, pulled up my dark cloak and spread my dark wings wide. I flew to Vancouver as fast as I could. \nThe scene was bittersweet, one of them had stabbed the other. I sat there on top of a car watching their squabble. The woman was clutching her stomach, crying. The other two men were still at each other\u2019s throats. The one lying dead in the background was Samuel.  Perhaps there was no hope. I sighed. Was there anymore that I could have done? Three they were. I jolted up, I looked towards the three survivors in front of me, and they were all lying in their cots. Fast asleep. It was a soul somewhere in the alps. It would have to find heaven or hell on its own. I was not leaving this spot. \nFor the following months, I could feel the brooding tension between the last three survivors, they had food, they had water, and they had shelter. Yet the bickered, they were the last humans on the world, but they acted like immature children, not realizing how dire their situation was. At this point I had made the point of learning their names. The woman was named Eve. I half hesitated at the irony. The two men were named Liam and Thomas. \n\n\u201cEve, are you awake?\u201d Thomas nudged Eve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEve.\u201d He whispered again. \n\u201cTh-thomas?\u201d She asked, still half asleep. \n\nAnd then I watched the magic happen. Maybe they were learning after all, or perhaps this was just a lust driven action in a situation where death was a sweet, sweet aphrodisiac. \nAnd soon enough, Four they were. As eve gave birth to the first human in this post-apocalyptic world. But I kept watching over them. As long as it took, by my hand, I will not run out of work. \n\n",

            "comment": "After eons of guiding souls into their afterlife, one wouldn't expect the reaper to fear the end. It seemed so natural till now. I've guided billions of souls into the afterlife. They're ALWAYS scared, no matter what they claim. I never really understood why. \n\nWasn't the logical conclusion of life, death? Why fear something that gives meaning to something you love so dearly? No one answered these questions for me. Contrary to popular belief among humans, I've never seen/met a \"God\" or a \"Devil\". The afterlife as far as I can tell is just an empty canvas, where each soul's deeds are reflected unto itself. So it's understandable that humans believe there's a \"good\" and a \"bad\" afterlife called heaven and hell. Perhaps it's me that they mistake for some celestial entity that rules over two different realms of the afterlife.\n\nHumans are most definitely the most creative souls I've encountered. They are so very imaginative and passionate about what they believe. I've always had a hard time reaping their souls in particular. Other simple souls like those of animals and kremin souls are much easier. Animals are not as passionate or creative and are not quite as scared of me as humans are. Kremins, on the other hand are the only species on their planet and are not rules by emotions. They too have a hint of fear but only at their first sight of me. \n\nHumans, however, are so much more complicated. There's such a mix of emotions as they cross the veil. Anger, fear, sorrow, and sometimes a hint of satisfaction. I always try to comfort them as best as possible. It's hard watching a human soul look back at its little one and realise that that's the last time it could see its child. Unfortunately for me, I do feel, unlike the Kremin. I usually make an extra effort to make their afterlife a little more comfortable than what their life affords them. A small likeness of their loved one here, a small beautiful landscape there, and the like.\n\nNow, after so many eons of this, it all finally seems to be coming to an end. The celestial body of residence of the Kremins was destroyed by an asteroid about 8000 Kremin years ago. It was a busy couple of days for me. All those souls were understandably a little more shaken and anxious than I expected them to be. It definitely was quite a task to lead all those souls one after another to their afterlives keeping them as happy as I possible could, but that was nothing compared to the end of the human residence.\n\nQuite interestingly, the humans were the reason for their own extinction, alongwith the extinction of the other species sharing their celestial residence. Their 3 global wars wiped out most of them. Their extreme passion and creativity led to inventions that they got addicted to, and these inventions eventually exhausted their resources and also rendered the atmosphere of their celestial residence uninhabitable. This also led to the residence warming up and it's waters rising in catastrophic bouts. Several humans and other land-based life-forms perished in these risings. Water-based and amphibious lifeforms were eradicated by the pollution caused by humans. \n\nSurviving humans fell gradually to the pollution that their kind caused. Now, after a most emotionally tasking decade of reaping, I see there are only 7 humans left. Once they fall, the purpose of my existence is defeated, and by universal law, I would cease to exist. Ironic isn't it? The humans are the end of death itself. After all these eons, it indeed is curiosity that killed death itself, albiet the curiosity of humans. I feel it now, I understand. Fear. We all feel fear at the end. It's not quite as easy to explain why. It's that sense of uncertainty and the feeling of being stolen of all purpose and opportunity. It's the feeling of leaving everything you lived for behind.\n\nI'm ashamed to admit it, but just like humans, I too desperately yearn to prolong my existence. Perhaps that's because of all the years of sympathizing with them. The 7 surviving humans are the only things keeping me from the end, and I will do everything in my power to keep them alive. Even death in desperation would do unthinkable things, like bring life.  That's what they call me. Life. Mary just gave birth. Something they thought was impossible given that all the surviving men were sterile. I've forced life into this poisoned planet, for my own sake. Who reaps me? Given what I've just done, what is my canvas going to be like?",

            "comment": "Why are they so damned hard to kill now? There were so many of them before. When these frail things began to play with power they didn't understand, I knew I was in for a treat. I watched in delight as they snuffed each other out in droves. There were too many anyway. Not enough to go around in the end. This would be a good thing for them. They would bounce back like they always do. The cycle would begin again as it always did. I would again know the joy of claiming them. Giving them my justice. Be it a boon or a curse, it was all the same to me. There were so many weak links to pressure into feeding my lust. An insult here, a nudge there. I whispered in their ears that they would be hailed as the saviors of their race. There are so few now. Good. When I reap the last one I will finally be free of my wretched existence. I am the cold hand in the night. They call me Death. As if the apes could comprehend it. I've always been proud of my grim duty. Before it was because I thought myself noble. A teacher for these primitive beings. Showing them the sins of the forebearers and allowing them to learn and grow from it. I used to think I was the one to shepard them into a golden age. Show them how to become more. I thought their potential took form when I saw them spread to the stars. I knew the cycle would continue. I could continue my work until I was no longer needed. A shadow in the back of their minds to push them ever forward. Then, instead of looking outward at the marvels around them, they looked inward. They turned on each other. I would reap their souls, thinking the others would learn as I had always intended. Instead, they fed on their own hate and ignored my lessons. This race learned nothing now. I have grown to hate them for this. I began to enjoy my time with new entertainment. Chemical weapons that burned at the water they carried within them, making them scream in agony. I wanted them to suffer as I suffered. I bathed them in the warmth of their own nuclear flame. When their bombs began to fray the thread that held together their new found homes, I let their homes take revenge. Sudden and swift catastrophe to erase their taint. The planets shed their own blood across their faces just to be rid of the plague called man. The apes fled to the last rock that tolerated them on it's surface. Their primordial Mother and the only one that wouldn't turn them away in their final hour. She was always too kind to them. They've been bleeding her with wild abandon, but she perseveres to give them all she has. Such is a Mother's love I suppose. She cradled them in her arms again yet the fire burned on. Now there are so few I can't find any to pit them against. I have to use a more... direct approach now. An itch at the back of the mind, reminding them of their loss. For some the itch is so unbearable they scratch at it until it festers and they cleanse it from their brain with a bullet. The rest begin to adapt by clumping together where they can to find a salve in each other. They should have been easy prey again. Yet they no longer hear my whispers to turn on each other. I won't let them continue after what they've done. When the last of their ilk falls I can finally know peace. Be rid of my pain by inflicting it on them. When they die, I die. Returning to the void, where I can't feel the sting of their betrayal. I set small traps for them. A natural gas leak when they think they've found a stove that works. Three burned that day, but I watched in horror as their compatriots rushed in with the bane of my existence. They call it \"medicene\" and because of it there are no souls to reap today. I curse them for finding a way around their doom. I try to bring them famine hoping I could just force them to eat each other. The fiends huddle in caves to share what nourishment they have, denying me my revenge. They continue to survive my assaults to my dismay. Their Mother tries to shield them from my wrath. Bringing them rain to reward their insolence. The selfish brats keep me locked in my rage. I set more traps but they notice my patterns now. They get harder to catch off guard. I lay loose trash over a pit as one walks alone. She's headed right for it and I shake with anticipation at my first catch in what feels like ages. I watch her as she mumbles something about Winter turning to Spring when she suddenly drops to her knees. No. She can't possibly know what lies ahead. She pulls out a pendant from under her shirt and kisses it. I sigh in relief when she stands and begins forward again. She comes to the edge of my trap. She looks right at it and I hear her words. \"Thank you Life. Please continue to show me how my story can end.\" She says, \"Remind me of my mortality to keep me humble, remind me that equality is found by all in death. Thank you Life for showing me the dangers that surround your gift, giving it a preciousness my people forgot. Amen.\" My hate focuses on this sanctimonious amoeba. I catch a glimpse of her pendant. A scythe. I realise in disgust that she was talking to me. Praying to me like one of their pagan Gods. The fools think their own adaptations to my machinations some gift from their imaginary heavens. They have even stripped me of name. The call me \"Life\" now. Try as I might, they always see through any deception I create to claim them. They continue to narrowly miss calamity and falsely interpret the acts as signs of my protection. I nudge the mountains to shake loose a rain of crushing death. As the boulders speed to their path, they stop walking. They spread out, drop to their knees and reach for the pointless baubles around their necks. The boulders come crashing down towards the party of meatbags, but they don't move. The rock slide tumbles through their ranks and misses every one. Every damned one. They celebrate by embracing each other, cheering that Life had saved them once again. How cruel my existence has become to rob me of my own peace. Quietly, one slips away in the night. I reap him, gaining little satisfaction from an old man dying peacefully in his sleep. My jealousy burns in me. They can die independent of one another, while I am stuck here until my duty carried out. When the last ape coughs out it's death rattle, I may know the peace denied to me. Now, when all I want is for them to cease, they realize the lessons I tried to teach them before. They have learned humility. They honor their dead by thanking them for the mistakes they made, so they can be passed down to the next generation. This is the final insult. When I loved them, they hated me. Now when I hate them they love me. Not what I am now, but what I was. Only now that they can see my hand all around them do they change their ways. They were supposed to do this on their own. Guiding themselves to glory, with only their own mortality pushing them onward. In my attempts to extinguish them I begin to see again what I loved in the first place. When their numbers dwindle to a dozen in a single tribe, I see the end of my hate. A child is born to the first woman that saw me. It's beauty startles me, awakening something I thought lost. The guilt of a millennia tormenting these creatures assails me all at once. The shepard in me sees what I have wrought and weeps. They were not my creation, but they were my charge. How could I have failed them so completely? I now embrace the shepard I was to atone for what I've done. I make my traps less elaborate and easier to spot. They continue to sense them, stopping before the dangers can strike. I play into the myth they made for me. I intentionally allow them to dodge my scythe so they keep their humility. Those that grow vain, ignore the signs and become the mistakes the rest are now grateful for. They help each other, show respect to one another and a love that binds them together. I set more traps for them to see and veer away from. In doing so I guide them to food and clean water. They reclaim the parts of the past that made them great and discard the rest. I can hardly believe it's the same species. Their numbers continue to swell, as does my love. They show a bond their ancestors never had and for the first time I feel hope for a dream once lost. They have finally fulfilled their destiny to become what I first saw in their fledgling race. They continue to pray to \"Life\". Though it is not my name or my nature. I will claim this mantle. I accept it's heavy burden and vow to never abandon them again. Their Mother was right all along. They are worth saving.",

It would be quick and we won't hurt as much\"\n\n\"Shut up!\"\n\nIn this almost empty world that I'm trying to protect, I find Francis, alone and walking down the empty streets as he gripped on to a broken piece of glass with his one hand and held his hand with the other.\n\nI know this man very well. I've watched him since the start of this world's great tragedy.\n\nHe's the only one left in this world that hears the voices of those that don't exist. He is the only one who hasn't listened to them...yet.\n\n\"Just leave me alone already! I've been dealing with all your bullshit since before this world became this fucked up! I just want you to be quiet\", he screamed. Tears flowing down his face as paced around with a hand that held on to the glass shard that was now dripping with his blood.\n\nI watched him quarrel with the voices that pushes him to end it.\n\nI watched him throw things at people that aren't there.\n\nHurt himself because he wanted to punch one of them out of frustration.\n\nHis quarreling with them was a normal occurrence but today was very different than usual.\n\n\"Just kill yourself already! We're getting bored here\"\n\n\"Kill yourself! Kill yourself! Kill yourself!\"\n\n\"No one's left to love you anyway. It's better to just die, right?\"\n\nI used to not feel anything when I watched those that had the same problem as him, take their lives away in order to escape the voices that plague them in this desolate world. \n\nIt was my job to not care...but now its different.\n\n\"Why don't you guys stop right there?\", I said to the people that aren't even there.\n\n\"Goddammit! Not another one\", he groaned to himself as he crouched down to grab his head.\n\n\"And who the heck are you?\", asked one of the voices.\n\n\"...Who I am is not important. What's important is that you let him have his quiet\"\n\n\"Yeah? And why should we care what you think?\"\n\n\"Because I know your reason for doing it\"\n\nThis voices are just like me.\n\nI am \"alive\" because humanity is still alive.\n\nThe only reason they are alive is because Francis is alive. \n\n\"If you think that's enough to-\"\n\n\"You think your existence is a waste because you could never interact with the real world. You bully him because you can never take it out on anything other than him. All of you are sicknesses, a disease, parasites who's sole reason to live is to torment whoever you host because you were never born...but I will need to stop you now\"\n\nI cut the leeches that stuck on to his soul.\n\n\"Children that couldn't receive the warmth of life. Rest now and hope that the future will gift you that warmth\"\n\nIt was never in my jurisdiction to take the souls of the living when they do not have the shroud of death looming over them but these children are different. \n\nThey were never born, so they never lived.\n\n\"T-They're gone!\"\n\nI could have let them stay if they only helped him rather than torment his mind with words that served no purpose other than to break him.\n\n\"They're finally gone!!\"\n\nI just hope that their souls find the peace that they wanted.\n\n\"Thank you! Thank you, so, so much!\"\n\nFrancis bowed his head deeply on to the ground as the sound of sobbing fills the streets with noise.\n\n\"There should be a camp nearby if you continue walking straight. You should join them and try to live together\"\n\nI left him there as he continued to cry tears of joy for the silence that he finally received. \n\nI can't console him as he will become dependent on the idea that I will be there to help him. I want him to grow accustomed to his mind from here on out.\n\n\n...\n\n......\n\n.........\n\nStay strong...This parasite still needs you and all the others to be around. \n\nLive so you grow and increase in numbers... then, when the world becomes able to function once more... I will pass this baton back to Life and be the fetcher of souls that I had always existed to be.",

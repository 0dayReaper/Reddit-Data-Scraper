            "comment": "In a room blacker than night, devoid of stars or any other such beauties, I floated. It was some shattered gap between nowhere and everywhere, the kind of lonely afterlife I'd always imagined would suit me best. \n\nI deserved nothing more. \n\nIt stayed that way for -- how do I put this? Forever, and yet not forever. I did not age, or move, or even feel the eons slink by in a human manner, and yet I knew it had been an eternity by the time the angel first appeared. He was a stark contrast to the void around us, brighter than the sun, yet cast light on nothing, as if his glow were being devoured by the abyss. \n\nSuddenly, I was standing on a circular piece of stone, and had some semblance of weight and being. \n\nThe angel opened his arms and spoke not in words, but directly to my mind. \"Timothy Halpert Bennington. You are now ready for judgment.\"\n\nJudgement. Ha, of course the afterlife would be something like religions predicted. I'm sure my life had left a bad taste in God's mouth. I didn't respond, only stared into the nothing below me. \n\n\"Your first Judge: the one you were cruelest to in life.\"\n\nI cocked my head, brows knitting into a line. People from my life would be judging me?\n\n*No. No, please, just send me to Hell.*\n\nMy eyes tried to shut, like slamming the door behind you to avoid a conversation you don't want to deal with, but something kept them open. The angel hadn't moved a muscle, and yet, I knew it was him. \n\nA pocket of light smudged something within itself. That smear of darkness stepped forward, onto another stone tile, and clarified as the pocket zipped up. \n\nIt was her. I knew it would be, but that didn't make it any easier to bear. \n\n\"Oh, Timmy, you're so young,\" she said, a soft smile on her face. \"I've missed you so much.\"\n\nI couldn't meet her eyes and searched for words, but my lips only trembled, mouthing empty motions. My eyes fell to the stone beneath her. \n\n\"Look at me, Timothy.\" \n\nI obliged.\n\n\"When you were a boy, no more than fifteen, you once burned all of my photo albums. Not just the ones with your father in them, but the ones of us, family trips and gatherings, every memory I ever had. They were erased forever, those last bits I had of him and our carefree times. I cried every day for a month, when you weren't home. That was my joy, mementos of when life was simple and fun, which you turned to ash.\"\n\nThere was nothing I wanted more than to squeeze my eyes shut, but I could not; I was forced to watch the sadness in her eyes as she spoke.\n\n\"That was your most cruel action-- it hurt me more than when your father left us. He had always been unkind, but for you, the light of my life, to torch away our memories like that... it broke me.\"\n\nBefore I could muster the courage to apologize, she slipped away into light. I felt sick, so humanly sick in my stomach, but knew there would be no relief. One does not vomit in the afterlife.\n\nThe angel offered me no reprieve. \"Your second judge: the one you were most kind to.\"\n\nOnce more a flash, and once more an approach. My eyes widened, face flickering as I tried to understand.\n\n\"You didn't expect to see me again, did you?\" Her smile was wide and bashful. \n\n\"How...?\" \n\n\"Oh, silly boy. The mind plays tricks on us sometimes. You probably thought that, because you'd caused me a great pain in life, there was no way you could have brought me joy, but life is not that black and white. It's so much more than that.\"\n\nStill I searched, and still I found no words. \n\n\"You were harsh -- even cruel -- at times, but it wasn't always like that. Your pain changed you, and even then, you weren't a purely cruel person. Just one that lashed out once in a while because you didn't understand how to handle it. Life can get very confusing.\n\n\"This is my favorite story. When you were ten -- such a cute little man -- you wrote me a poem for a school project. I'll never forget the words on that card: *To Mom, my bestest friend. I love you more than gummy bears or mac and cheese. You make me happier than Racer when I drop a potato chip and he eats it. Happy birthday to the best mommy in the whole wide world.* You wrote that on a card decorated with hearts and smiley faces. You didn't know it, but that was right when I'd first been diagnosed and your father started to show signs of his poor character as a man. Then, on top of it, you cooked me dinner, and it was so bad but I ate every bite. It was the best meal I've ever had. \n\n\"Never in my entire life have I felt as happy as I did in that moment. You were such a deeply caring boy before everything went wrong.\"\n\nI barely even remembered any of that. Had I really done something to make her happy? Why didn't I remember it, when I remembered such other, terrible things so clearly? \n\nShe disappeared into the light as I searched my soul, digging for answers but only turning up dirt. The angel, kind as he was, did not let me take a moment to figure things out. \n\n\"Your third judge: the one whose life you saved.\"\n\nI froze. The one whose life I saved? I'd never saved a life, I'd only done things far from it. Perhaps it was standard practice, and no one would walk through the portal this time. \n\nBut, just like clockwork, she was back again, her smile warmer than the halo over her head.\n\nI gaped at her. \"No. No, I killed you. This makes no sense, I didn't save you. Is this some kind of sick joke? Do angels play pranks on people?\" \n\n\"Oh, sweetie,\" she said, shaking her head. \"It was mercy. Besides, the sickness had already stolen me. Letting me go in peace in no way makes it your fault. Have you held yourself accountable all this time?\"\n\nI couldn't find it in me to respond, mashing my teeth together instead.\n\n\"It was my time to go. There was so much pain and suffering that plagued me, in the end; my sickness was no fault of yours. The fact that you put all your hurt aside and stayed with me so I wouldn't be alone meant more than the world. You did the most brave thing a boy can do for his mother, and saved me.\n\nFinally, there were words I found that I'd been looking for, choked and jagged as they were. \"I love you, Mom. I'm so sorry I wasn't a better son.\"\n\n\"Shh, now, darling. Your hurt is almost over. I'll be waiting for you.\"\n\nOne final time, she faded away. \n\n\"And now, your final judge,\" the angel said. \"The one whose life you took.\"\n\nMy nails bit into the skin, I clenched so hard, and I breathed deep to keep myself together in front of the angel overseeing it all-- though, honestly, hiding things probably didn't work when in the presence of Godly beings.\n\nFor when the swirling portal of light opened, it was not my mother that walked through as it had been the previous three times. No, it was someone much more familiar, and somehow, more terrifying. \n\nMe. \n\nI fought hard to look away, harder than I'd fought before, but I just couldn't. There was no power in me, wherever I was, and so I simply stood there, frozen and sobbing at my own reflection. \n\n\"This is probably pretty rough for you,\" he said, pursing his lips. \n\nI let out a croak in response. \n\n\"You've always been too hard on yourself, you know that? Isn't it time that you get a little peace, too?\"\n\n\"I don't deserve it,\" I whispered.\n\n\"Everyone does. This world is a complicated and terrifying place, and everyone knows their own pain. You lived a life consumed by yours, more than equal penance for your mistakes.\n\n\"You've heard what she had to say, and seen the smile she still wears. You hurt her, yes, but you were also the joy of her life. Your father left because she was sick, not because you weren't worth it; he was the problem, not either of you. Your mother loved and still loves you, and you're not a bad man for the things you suffered. I only wish I could've shown you that earlier. \n\n\"But, alas, I digress. Let's not do this-- you've spent long enough convincing yourself you don't deserve to be happy. It's time to rest, now, Tim. Be at peace.\"\n\nHe held out a hand. \n\nI stepped forward and took it. \n\n---\n\n*/r/resonatingfury*\n\nSide note: the outreach on this has been absolutely incredible.

We see the mother's forgiveness even as she goes on to describe his cruelty. It's this gut-twisting realization that we can still be redeemed in spite of our actions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaving timothy face himself as the final judge is a fantastic idea. WHen other Timothy says:\n\n&gt;\"You've always been too hard on yourself, you know that? Isn't it time that you get a little peace, too?\n\nIt makes the reader realize that the same is probably true for their own lives, and really pulls the whole emotional piece together.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm off to save this and dissect it more when I need to write some feels. 10/10 blew me away.",

We don't know who Timothy Halpert Bennington is, so we become him.  \n\nSome things are universal to all people.   Few words are required to convey a lifetime of regret and pain, self-doubt and anger -  these are things that are intrinsically understood.   There are plenty of authors that can write about a character's pain, but to convey it in a way that allows the reader to attach their own version of this journey to the story they are reading is a rare breed.\n\nVery well done!",

            "comment": "I don't know how but I find myself sitting in my old childhood bedroom.  In the darkness.  I was gone, and then poof, here I am, wondering what's next.  I know I'm gone, I watched the instant replay of it before getting beamed up.  Now I'm in my old bed.  Waiting.  \n\nThat's when I hear a knock at the door.  I don't realize it, but I'm not at all prepared for what's to follow.  \n\nIn walked myself.  Wearing a black suit and tie.  What's left of the hair combed over nicely.  It was like looking in a mirror.  Uncanny.  Surreal.  I felt a tinge of shame, though. Shame that even in death, I was disappointed in myself for not being in better shape.  For not looking more youthful.  \n\n\"You are about to go through your final judgments, old friend.\" Dark Mike says to me.  \n\n\"I'm dead, right? What.. is this?\" I manage to ask myself.  \n\n\"Your final judgments...\" Dark Mike says, cocking an eye up sarcastically in a way all too familiar. \"You will meet the four people that have been most impacted by your decisions.\"  \n\nMy mind flashes back.  Victoria.  Mom.  Grandma.  Sean.  Melody.  \n\nImages of people I wronged, people I cherished, people who hurt me.  All people I loved.  \n\n\"For your first judgment, it is the person you were the most cruel to.  Spoiler alert, Mike.  It's yourself.\" Dark Mike says as he extends a hand. \"I'll be judge number one today.\"  \n\n\"Psshh..\" I say, shaking my head. \"Myself?\" \n\nI reach for his hand to shake it.  He grabs it with the other hand. \"Yes, Mike.  Yourself.  This isn't a joke, you must come to terms with this fact before you can move on.  Look at me.  How does it make you feel?\"  \n\n\"I feel sorry for Victoria, honestly.\" I couldn't help myself.  Self-deprecation became a big part of my humor as I got older.  I burst out a bit of laughter.  \n\n\"Exactly.\" Dark Mike says.   \n\nHe picks up the remote and turns on the TV.  The brightness temporarily blinds me as my eyes adjust to the screen.  It's Victoria.  My eyes well up as a lump appears in my throat.  She's smiling, cracking up laughing.  The screen quickly reveals me as the one who's got her rolling.  It cuts to me tying my tie in the mirror.  I remember this, it was her sister's wedding.  I never noticed the way she was looking at me.  The painful montage went on, and on until I was crying uncontrollably.  \n\nI hated myself for so long, and I can see now it only served as a wedge between her and I.  She loved me for who I was.  I couldn't do myself the same justice.  So many wasted moments.  Anger rushed over me as I look up to tell Dark Mike to stop it.  \n\nHe was gone.  I wasn't in my bed anymore.  \n\nI was at Myers-Richman Office Supplies.  My old company.  Well, not *MY* old company, but the place I worked most of my life.  Big shot account executive at 25 years old, 10 years down the line I'd still be an account executive.  \n\nAs I wander the dark halls of my old office, I reflect on how much I grew to hate this place.  What *KEPT* me here.  God, so much wasted time in this shit-hole.  \n\n\"You weren't always nice to everyone inside this building,\" a familiar voice says from behind me. I turn. \"but there was one person you were very nice to.  And that is the second person who is to pass judgment on you.  And yes, as you've guessed--\"  \n\nIt was me.  At 30 years old, though.  *Get out while you still can!!* I think to myself, ironically.  \n\n\"--the person you were the nicest to, was this guy.  The Meyrs-Richman Office Supplies Account Executive Mike McAndrews.\" Dark Mike said, raising both his arms up in a shrug.  \n\n\"I don't exactly follow...\" I reply blankly.  \n\nDark Mike fired up a PowerPoint on the projector.  As he flipped through still images of my expressions throughout my time here, he continued.  \"Account Exec Mikey Drew needed a kick in his ass.  He needed to taste the cruel truth that his talents were being wasted at this crappy company in a dying industry.\" Dark Mike explained, \"He needed to hear that he was a lazy unmotivated coward. But you were nothing but nice to him.\"  He had paused the PowerPoint on an image of myself crying on my way home from work.  I barely remembered that.  \n\nTears began to stream down my face as my stomach sank inwards.  Regret pressed against my torso, suffocating me.  *How could I have let so much of my life go to waste?* I think.  \n\n\"Alright, well presenting next is your third judgment.  The person who was saved by your actions.\" Dark Mike said, as he turned and left the conference room.  Before the door fully closed, he pushes it back open and walks back inside. \n\n\"Me again!\" he says with a smile. \"You saved me, with all that kindness.  You saved this guy, the person you became and eventually died as.  Account Executive Mike McAndrews.\"  \n\n\"AND WHAT'S SO WRONG WITH THAT?!\" I shout back at him.  \n\nMy face was red, rough.  Dry tears left my eyes bloodshot and vision blurred.  I stand up, and slam my hands on the table.  \n\n\"TELL ME!\" I shout.  \n\n\"You already know the answer, Mike.\" Dark Mike says softly.  \n\nThe cabinets turned to bookshelves.  The chairs to couches.  The office turned into a bookstore and it was full of people.  Dark. Everything is just, dark.  I cant see their faces, I cant hear them, but I can sense their emotions.  \n\nThey stood in line, but all seemed to be looking at me.  They all love me.  They all look up to me.  \n\nThe line leads my eyes towards my final judgment.  I can just feel it.  I am truly curious, and make my way towards him.  He sat there, at the head of the line.  A table was set before him, he looked to be signing books.  \n\nHe looks vaguely familiar, but I can't figure out who I am looking at.  He's older than me, much older.  \n\nHe looks cool.  Relaxed.  He turns up to look at me.  \"I'm your final judgment, Mike.  I am the person who died because of your choices.\" he stands up, and extends his hand. \"I am Mike McAndrews, pleasure to meet you.\" \n\nI step back.  \n\n*Me?* I think.  \n\n\"No, not you.  Your heart doesn't make it as long as mine.  All that stress you took on did a number on you, Mikey.\" Older Mike says.  \n\n\"You know who I am, you are smart.  I know that.\" Older Mike continues.\n\n\"You're the Ghost of Christmas Future.\" I respond, amazed.  I observe myself.  \n\n*Mid 60's.  In great shape.  Handsome even.  Happy.*  \n\n\"You didn't appreciate the opportunity you had.  You lived a full life, not to take away from that.  You lived a life many would consider themselves lucky to have lived.  Died too young? Maybe, depends on who you ask.\" Older Mike said.  \n\n\"You knew you were depressed.  You knew why.  You knew what you had to do.  You just, didn't.\" he continued.  \n\n\"Do you remember Quentin Tarintino? Stephen Spielberg? Stephen King?\" he asked, \"Of course you do.  You know another name that is synonymous with those in the year 2049? Mike McAndrews. You knew you had potential.  All the feedback you ever received in your life were signs of this.  My signs.  You didn't listen, Mike.  You've got one more shot, do something with it.\" and with that last word, he shoved me backwards and I woke up surrounded by paramedics.",

            "comment": "I've spent a long time worrying since I found out. Word gets around, even in a grey, dismal place like Purgatory. Maybe faster here than other places, it's not like there's a whole lot to do but huddle together in the churning grey of the mists and whisper. We don't talk loudly here. Voices carry themselves to odd places.\n\nNo one comes back here, no one human I mean. The angels, they come and go, ferrying us to appointments. Sometimes, the mists part, above or below, and you get a glimpse. The angels tell us what we're seeing isn't strictly real, not the way we used to think about reality. It's metaphysical, the disembodied mind's attempt to make sense of a kind of being it hasn't fully adapted to yet.\n\nBut still. There are horrors waiting for some of us, there's no doubt about that. I've seen them too, and my mine rolls through its own interpretations of them in quiet moments. I've also seen waiting glory, and the gentle spaces in between.\n\nI don't know which will be mine, but now I know who will decide. Help decide, I guess, I think the Powers that Be make the final decision, but the Four sit in judgement, and I worry, worry. I don't think I've led a particularly good life, when I think about it in my honest moments, there alone with the mists and the small parted glimpses of what lies beyond. The whispers all around, speculating, gossiping, blaming. Worrying, like me.\n\nI don't know who those four people will be. I don't think I've killed anyone. I don't think I've saved another person either, not really. I kept my cold misery to myself, most days. Tried to. Tried to find a little happiness, some days, but kept other people out of that to.\n\nThe day comes. The angels that escort me are hard to look at, angels always are. So instead I close my eyes, try for calm, reach out for a little peace. It doesn't really come, and soon I've arrived where I need to be without any conscious movement on my part. I open my eyes.\n\nI stare. I think the shock might kill me, if I had any mortality left to give.\n\nThey speak, right to left.\n\n\"I am the person you were the most cruel to,\" I say. And yes, it is me who says it, me looking down from that high seat. Or a version of me. Sad, beaten-down. I know him at once. I shudder. I can only nod.\n\n\"I am the one you were kindest to,\" says my next self. He has a smile despite the lines of care on his face. He is holding my favorite book. Our favorite book, maybe, and a chilled bottle of something with no edge of alcohol.\n\n\"I am the person you saved,\" says the me to his left. He sets down a small token. My ten-year sobriety chip. I am shaking, and I feel I would sweat if I could. I cannot look at the next one in line, but the angels do not give me a choice, and my gaze shifts.\n\n\"I am the one you killed with your choices,\" I slur, and I dash the bottle I hold against the marble floor.\n\n\"Mercy,\" I say. \"Please. I did my best.\"\n\n\"That is for us to decide,\" they say, as one, as me, and the trial commences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nr/Magleby for more elaborate lies.",

            "comment": "Sarah sighed as the alarm screeched at her from across the bedroom. She cursed herself, as the neon-green light flashed \"5:30\", for placing it so far away. The Sun hadn't even risen yet, so why should she? \n\n\"I got it,\" said a voice. Her husband, David, rolled out of bed and walked over to the alarm. He ran a wave of salt-and-pepper hair back over his head as he tried to work out how to turn off the alarm. \n\nSarah raised a hand in protest. \"That was for my work -- you don't need to be up.\"\n\n\"I kind of do. This was keeping me awake.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" she said, with little feeling behind it.\n\n\"There, you little bastard!\" he cried triumphantly as the beeping finally stopped. The alarm's silence only revealed the crying of a baby -- Sarah let out her second sigh of the day.\n\n\"I got that too,\" said David as he put on his dressing-gown and headed to the door. \"You try to get another ten minutes, okay? You need it way more than I do. Breakfast will be ready when you are.\"\n\nIt was true that she needed it. She hadn't been sleeping well. Or doing anything well, for that matter. Life had become so... grey, since Thea had been born. So hard and tedious and stupid. It always felt like she was mentally trudging through thick porridge. \n\nThe crying stopped and Sarah allowed herself a deep breath. She wouldn't get back to sleep now, but at least she could lay down and do nothing for a few minutes. Think of nothing. Pretend to be nothing.\n\nThe alarm began to beep. \n\nSnooze. \n\nHe'd hit god-damned snooze.\n\n\n\nTwenty minutes later, she was mostly-dressed and eating breakfast, forcing sloppy scrambled eggs into her mouth and down into her stomach. She wondered why she bothered eating at all. Maybe to please David, she thought. Not much she did pleased him anymore. Or vice-versa, in truth.\n\nHer husband held Thea in one arm and her car-keys in his free hand. \"I'll get her strapped in then I'll come grab you.\"\n\n\"You don't need to give me a lift,\" Sarah protested. \"I'm fine driving.\"\n\n\"No offence, but you don't look fine. Those rings around your eyes... Did you sleep at all?\"\n\nA shudder of rage rippled up Sarah's spine. \"I said I'm fine. Just... Go watch Netflix or something until you need to leave. I'll drop Thea off at Mom's before work.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe black cloak of the creature seated at the front of the courtroom made him look a little like how Sarah imagined Death would dress. The fact that he had a skeletal face almost convinced her that that was indeed who it was. However, he referred to himself as the Adjudicator, and her lawyers swore the two weren't even related.\n\nThe room was filled to the wooden rafters with jeering men, women, children, demons, skeletons, and a host of creatures that Sarah didn't like to look at. They looked like how she felt inside. \n\nThe crowd were loud and baying for blood, and Sarah knew it was for hers in particular. She hoped they'd get it.\n\n\"Order,\" came the voice of the Adjudicator. \"Order!\" He slammed down his gavel and a tsunami of silence washed over the crowd behind her. \n\nSarah was seated near the front, with her lawyer -- a two headed demon called Mary-and-Sue, who was biting her nails nervously with both mouths. The lawyer paused long enough to whisper to Sarah, \"It's okay, sweetie. They can't prove you did it on purpose. Which you didn't, remember?\" Her other head, Sue, butted in, \"And if in doubt, always remember that you *can't* remember.\" With that, the creature's hands jammed back into its mouths.\n\nSarah shook her head. \"I really don't remember though. I was just driving and...\" She would have cried if she were able, but that ability had died long before she had. \"I just want to be sentenced fairly. That's all. If I did what I'm accused of then let me rot in Hell forever.\" She'd been waiting in purgatory for what felt like forever already. Whether guilty or not in court, she wanted this over with. She knew what had happened as a result of her actions. Hell seemed a more than fair outcome.\n\n\"Shh!\" hissed Mary-and-Sue. \"Let's not give the Adjudicator any ideas!\"\n\nAs if he'd heard his name, the Adjudicator glanced at Sarah.\n\n\"Let us begin today's proceedings,\" he said. His voice rumbled around the room, as if a giant were speaking into a barrel. \"Purgatory versus Sarah O'Manahue. Charges: suicide and infanticide.\"\n\n\"Minor charges really,\" whispered Sue.\n\n\"She doesn't mean minor as in child...\" said Mary.\n\n\"She knows what I mean.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" said the Adjudicator. \"Or I will find you in contempt of this court!\"\n\n\"Sorry!\" cried Mary-and-Sue.\n\nThe Adjudicator nodded slowly. \"Mister Hyde,\" he said, looking at a man with a sharp pinstripe suit and an even sharper smile sitting adjacent to Sarah, on the other side of the court room. \"Would you like to bring out your first witness for the prosecution?\"\n\n\"Gladly,\" said Mister Hyde, as he got to his feet and slicked back his black hair. \"Our first witness is the defendants very own husband. David O'Manahue.\"",

            "comment": "Contrary to popular belief, purgatory isn\u2019t some dark room or blinding light rail station to nowhere. There are people here. Hundreds of thousands of people spanning thousands of years and a multitude of cultures. It takes most by surprise when they \u201cwake\u201d up here. Took me by surprise for sure. All the common tropes of purgatory still exist, people coming and going as they are judged and found either worthy of the next step or not, endless waiting with seemingly nothing to do, impending sense of doom over you past actions\u2026 all of that good stuff. Here is the catch though, your adjudicators aren\u2019t some impersonal god, angels, or other all-powerful beings. It\u2019s your fellow man. Specifically, the person you were most cruel to, the person you were nicest to, the person who was saved by your actions, and the person who died because of your actions. How specific people are chosen if you saved or killed a lot of people are a mystery to us here in purgatory.\n \nIt\u2019s not all bad though. A massive city sprawls as far as you can see. Towering works of millions of individuals with nothing to do but plenty of time do it in. Sights that would put MC Escher to shame because of all the hands that have shaped this city. We call it Limbo, a bit on the nose, I know, but better other names that have been suggested.\n \nYou may be asking yourself, why are there so many people? It seems so simple, you die, you wait for your judges to do the same and then you move on. Right? Well there is the catch\u2026 What happens when the person selected to adjudicate you wasn\u2019t born until 200 years after your death?  How does that happen? You poisoned the earth, you created the next super bug, your seemingly in consequential actions added up to the death of thousands well after your life time, take your pick. It happens all the time. Most of us realize that this system is utterly broken and try to find something to do with our time. Some of the more sanctimonious among us fall back hard upon their doctrine of choice and try to justify what they are experiencing. Those unsavory characters in life found their talents useless here, for if you kill someone, they just \u201cwake\u201d back up soon after. Others of us try to carve out a life and give our stay in Limbo some sort of meaning. This is where I fit in. I\u2019m not trying to find meaning myself, but I help those who need meaning find it.\n \nYou see, there is a bit of a loophole here in Limbo. While we don\u2019t know exactly how it works, as I said before, we do know we can influence who our adjudicators are. It\u2019s not a science, it has no set rules other than the four judges must be someone you knew and have cause to fit into the categories for judgement. I connect these dots, help these poor souls move on from Limbo to the next stage, for better our worse. It is my penance for the actions of my life. I deserved much worse for the actions I performed.\n \nSo young \u201cwoken\u201d one, tell me who you have wronged, who you have cherished, who you have hurt, who you have saved, and those you have killed. Let us see if we can\u2019t move you to the next step of your journey.\n \n\n___\n\n*From Judas Iscariot to unnamed woken soul in Limbo 2024 AD*",

            "comment": "There's a saying. 'Hell is other people.' Coined by Sartre. It's not about how we betray each other, hurt each other, or even kill each other. It's about how we judge each other. It's about how we decide who people are, on their behalf, usually with no real experience or rationality, and apply that label to them forever. Even if it's disproven. Even if it was demonstrably false to begin with. We judge because we're judged. And we're judged because we judge.\n\nTwo men go to work in the morning, each hoping today is the other one's last day, because he's lazy, mean, Et Cetera. Each having no self-awareness, no insight into the other.\n\nA mother 'ruins' a daughters life by telling her what to wear. A daughter is 'rebellious' because of what she finds comfortable. Neither considers the other's perspective.\n\nTwo friends apply for a scholarship. Neither receives it. Neither knows the other didn't, because they both figure out how to pay for school without it. Each accuses the other of cheating him. Their friendship doesn't survive freshman year. Neither can stay friends with such a dirty-rotten-scoundrel rat-bastard. Neither wonders if the other might be telling the truth.\n\nWe're born. We're ripped out of the peaceful, empty nothingness, and thrust into Hell. We live in hell. We finally die. When we die, we're sent to... Hell? Well, maybe, but as it turns out, not immediately. First, we go to purgatory. Which I contend is just Hell by any other name.\n\nI woke up in purgatory just now, millennia ago. I've been waiting forever for the final judgment, which is happening immediately following my arrival. I've been listening to the other people talk. About the people they're leaving behind. How missed they'll be. And out of the other side of their mouths, why they don't miss them at all. And proving why they won't be missed. But who am I to judge?\n\nThey call my name. It echoes in my mind. I didn't speak to anyone in the eternity I've been here, I never got the chance, there was no time. And yet they all know it's my turn. I can feel them judging me. Hear them whispering about me. \n\n\"Welcome to Hell,\" I mutter, as I take the few steps of the limitless expanse between the waiting area and the judgment hall. I cross the doorway dividing one unidentifiable nothing from another.\n\n\"Be seated,\" a voice whispers and booms.\n\nI sit on a concrete bench that wasn't there when I walked in. I look around. A formless, empty void coalesces into a bright, stuffy courtroom. A judge sits directly across from me, miles above me. Other people appear. Three of them. Adversarial to me, but on my same level. More for the judging.\n\n\"Welcome to your judgment.\"\n\n\"It's all judgment. It's never been anything but judgment.\"\n\n\"Yes. This is the last. Four judges. First, the individual to whom you were most cruel.\"\n\nA man steps forward. I see him clearly now. Me. Me from the last thing I remember before I showed up here in the Hell of purgatory.\n\n\"You know why I'm here,\" He/I say(s).\n\n\"Yes,\" I say. Somehow, I know. Without him--me--saying a word, I know. How could I not know why it would be him?\n\n\"But do you know why you're here?\"\n\n\"To determine whether I go up or down?\" I ask.\n\n\"No.\" The man shakes his head. \"That decision's already been made.\"\n\n\"Then why do this?\"\n\nThe other me smiles and steps back. He is slowly replaced, as the judge above the other judges says, \"the individual to whom you were kindest.\"\n\nNot another me. A child. Spiky blond hair. Invisible eyebrows. A hot rod t-shirt. Oh. Of course. Now I remember. Not just any child. It's been so long.\n\n\"You know why I'm here,\" the boy says.\n\n\"Yes,\" I say. I do know. Somehow I know which thing, in a long list of things, matters most to that boy.\n\n\"But do you know why you're here?\n\n\"To determine whether I go up or down?\" I ask.\n\n\"No.\" The boy shakes his head. \"That decision's already been made.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\nThe boy smiles and steps back. He is slowly replaced, as the judge above the other judges says, \"the individual saved by your actions.\"\n\nA teenager. Dirty blond, or light brown hair, in an unfortunate bowl cut. Teeth too big for his mouth. Eyebrows dyed black, popping out from his sickly pale face. I recognize him. Of course I recognize him, it hasn't been that long. Not as long as the boy, anyway.\n\n\"You know why I'm here,\" the teen says.\n\n\"Yes,\" I say. It just comes to mind. I know what I did for that dying teen. I know how I saved him.\n\n\"But do you know why you're here?\"\n\n\"To determine whether I go up or down?\" I ask.\n\n\"No.\" The teen shakes his head. \"That decision's already been made.\"\n\n\"On what basis?\"\n\nThe teen smiles and steps back. Nobody moves to replace him, but the judge says, \"finally, the individual who died due to your choices.\"\n\n\"Where?\" I ask.\n\nThe boy, the teen, and the man return to their positions and stand facing me, silently, still smiling; staring at me surface-level, deep down inside, and all the way through.\n\n\"You know where,\" the judge says, and the man, the teen, and boy, too. \n\nI see myself through their eyes. My own eyes begin to water. I drop to my knees. I begin mumbling incoherently as the floodgates open.\n\nThey kneel and weep and mumble along with me, and then they stop and ask, \"but do you know why you're here?\"\n\nThe friends fall out because neither can face that they each think the other thinks he's a failure.\n\nThe mother is so quick to anger because she thinks her daughter thinks she's too strict, a disciplinarian. The daughter is so easily defensive because she thinks her mother thinks she's bad, a problem child.\n\nThe coworkers hate each other because each sees the other as a dark mirror. His own worst qualities reflected, amplified, pushed back on him. If they looked inside, they'd have to see that what they hate about each other is what they think the other hates about them.\n\nSo they blame the other. It's his fault. It's her fault. Not mine. Certainly not mine. It's because you judge me that I judge you. \n\nWe're born. We're ripped out of the peaceful, empty nothingness, and thrust into Hell. We live in Hell. We finally die. When we die, we're sent to... Hell? Yes. Hell. \n\nYes. I do now. \"The decision's already been made,\" I answer.\n\nThey nod in unison.\n\n\"Where?\" the judge asks.\n\n\"By whom?\" the boy asks.\n\n\"On what basis?\" the teen asks.\n\n\"And why do this?\" the man asks.\n\nWe blame other people to absolve ourselves.\n\nI address each in turn. \"Here,\" I say to the judge. \"Me,\" I tell the boy. \"You,\" I answer the teen. \"So I understand,\" I respond to the man.\n\nThey look at me, and each other.

            "comment": "Death, like sleep, came to me all of a sudden. \n\nAn errant bullet right through the brain, and the concrete dissolved into a field of dead grass; the buildings crumbled down; the clouds of dirt turned black and held onto the surface like a thick, ever-spreading mist; the sun forgot to shine, and in its forgetfullness it wound up dying.\n\nI rose to my feet. The wind carried ice on its currents, turning my bones into rattling things. With my hands in the refuge of my armpits, I wandered through the blackness in a state of utter confusion. In the distance, ceaseless shrilling screams boomed and faded, echoed and faded, thundered and faded.\n\nAmidst the fog, the mist, the shadows, there a tiny light shone. It was a small moon hovering knee-high, but despite its size, it illuminated fiercely, forcing the darkness to scurry away. After a minute of walking toward it, I saw a hand holding it in place.\n\nWhen I reached it, my eyes strayed to the hand, climbed up the arm, until it arrived to the face of the man who held it.\n\n\"Marc?\" I said, and his lips curled upward. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"You showed me love, you showed me kindness when I was buried in darkness. And it's finally time for me to do the same for you,\" he said, held out the little moon for me to hold. \"Here, it's yours. You will need it.\"\n\nMy brows knitted. \"What will I need it for?\"\n\n\"That answer doesn't belong to me,\" he said, and his voice became brittle, distant. \"But you have my gift, carry it. It's not a pleasant journey that in which there's no light.\"\n\nWith that, as though he was no more than a breeze, he disappeared. I caught the moon before it struck the grass, and with an aching heart, and a racing mind, I kept moving forward.\n\nI ambled, I wandered, I roved, and I trod. I did so, well aware that I was lost, but well aware that stillness would take me nowhere. And then, in the space of a breath, the shadows parted and from the blackness that was revealed, there came a man whose face I didn't know, but whose eyes carried a tangible longing.\n\nHe came, and without uttering a word, he embraced me. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered, his voice tarnished with grief.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nHe let go, and held my gaze, his eyes glossy with tears. \"The bullet was meant for me. It shouldn't have ever killed you.\"\n\nI swallowed, drew a deep breath, and sought in the innermost tunnels of myself for something to say. \"You don't have to apologize. Fate is strange, and you weren't the one who shot.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"But I'm the reason the gun was shot. Nasty business lead to nasty things. I owed money, and--and--\"\n\n\"There's nothing to worry about. Life has many paths for all of us. Did things get better after I died?\"\n\nHe looked at me, and nodded, his lips tight. \"I left, got as far away as I could, and started a different life. I thought my life was worthless, and that took me down that somber path, but when the bullet hit you, everything within me crumbled apart. My lack of self-worth wound up taking away the life of an innocent man.\"\n\nI rested a palm upon his shoulder. \"I forgive you. I really do.\"\n\nHe drew a deep breath, a tear fell down his cheek. He held my eyes then, and said, \"You taught me the value of life, and for that I will ever be grateful.\"\n\nAnd with that, he faded away.\n\nWith a heavy heart, I kept wandering. Perhaps I should have been harsher on him. Perhaps I should have shouted at him, but when I sought within me, I found no hatred, no rancor, nothing at all. And deep down, I knew my words had been the right ones.\n\nThe screams faded. They were buried underneath a deafening noise. I turned to it. On the horizon, a world of light collided against this world of darkness. It was a strange thing to witness, like two opposite, endless gales clashing, retreating, and clashing again.\n\nThis time, I ran toward it, toward the light. But the closer I got the farther the darkness seemed to push it away. When I reached the battle, I found myself standing in the point where both forces commingled, and from there, came my wife.\n\n\"Lucy?\" I said, and this time I was the one who hugged and cried. \"What are you doing here, honey? Tell me you are still alive.\"\n\nShe wrapped her arms around me, rested her head on my chest. \"I am. But I don't know if I am.\" Her voice was fragile, on the verge of breaking.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"Because you left me, you left me forever, and I don't if I can keep going. My heart aches too much, my thoughts are nothing but memories of you, it is as if I had died with you. You were my everything, and when you left I became nothing.\"\n\nI tightened my embrace, let the silence hung for a moment. \"There's always value in life, honey. A friend told me that. I might be gone, but our little Lily is still there, with you. You have to be strong, for her, for you, and for me.\" \n\nI kissed her forehead. \"I might be gone, but I will always be with you and with Lily, even if I have to fight the devil itself. Promise me you will keep going.\"\n\nShe raised her head, held my gaze. Her eyes were red, full of tears, her lips downturned. She shook her head. \"I--I can't. It's too dark in here,\" she said, and touched her chest.\n\n\"You can, honey,\" I held out the moon for her. \"Hold on to it dearly, until there's nothing but light within you. Then give it to someone who needs it.\"\n\nShe grabbed the moon with both hands, held it to her chest, its shine falling on her face.\n\n\"Promise me you will keep going,\" I said, wrapped my arms around her waist, and rested my head against hers. \"Promise me.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" she said, and pushed the moon into her chest. It parted into white tendrils and, in a slow dance, billowed their way into her heart. \n\nHer eyes drew to mine. My eyes drew to hers, and at the same time, as though we both knew what came next, we said, \n\n\"I love you, forever.\"\n\nThere was a surge of light, a blinding one. I closed my eyes. The coldness faded. I felt her leaving. And then came warmth. I opened my eyes, and an old man was standing in front of me. Behind him a sea of clouds swayed, and from their heart, a golden gate rose.\n\n\"May we go?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do I deserve it?\"\n\n\"Well, that's up to you. You are the last judge.\"\n\nI looked at him. \"Will I get to see my daughter grow up?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"We may go, then.\"\n\n------------------\n\nr/NoahElowyn",

            "comment": "I opened my eyes, and realized I was young again. I also instantly knew I was dead somehow and this was the afterlife. \n\nWell, almost. \n\nI was to stand trial, but I had no idea who my judges were. Four individuals were to judge me, and I needed at least three votes to be able to move on. If I received only two votes, I'd be trapped here in purgatory, and if I had less than that... \n\nI didn't want to think about it. \n\nA booming voice rang out. \"THE FIRST JUDGE - HE WHO THOUGHT YOU THE MOST CRUEL.\" \n\nMy heart dropped. Before me suddenly materialized a person that I feared and hated more than anything. My first husband. \n\nHe spoke like a wounded child.\" You know, all I ever did was love you. I *worshipped* you. I would have done *anything* for you! And you... You left me. It took me so long to find you, and when I did - you got a restraining order! I then got locked up in a mental hospital for life because of you! Why?! Why couldn't you love me the way I loved you?! \"\n\nThe answer spilled put of me in a rage. \"Because you were a controlling, fucked up, manipulative *bastard*! You isolated me from my family and friends by emailing them horrible messages pretending to be me! You spread rumors about me at my work and I was forced to resign! Then you started going crazy if I left the house for longer than an hour and threatened to kill yourself if I left you! I was so afraid and felt trapped for so long. I finally gained the courage to leave when you threatened to hurt Steve. My biggest regret in life was not realizing sooner what a sick piece of shit you were.\"\n\nHe was surprisingly stoic.\" I do not give her my vote,\" and with that he disappeared. \n\n\"This isn't fair!\" I screamed. \n\nThe booming voice spoke again. \"THE SECOND JUDGE - SHE WHO THOUGHT YOU THE MOST KIND. \n\nA woman appeared before me and smiled through tears. \n\nI lost my breath for a moment. \"Mom!\" \n\n\"Don't worry lovebug, we'll be together in just a little bit... I know it. Because if whatever powers that be try to keep you from me I swear I will fucking let all hell break lose so they better-\n\n\"WHAT IS YOUR VOTE?\" And you could hear just a hint of annoyance in its voice. \n\nI couldn't help but laugh. Only my mom would be crazy enough to curse and threaten the seemingly omnipotent being without a second thought for me. \n\nShe rolled her eyes. \"What the fuck do you think? My baby was always the sweetest, kindest girl in the world to me! Of course she has my vote! I-\" \n\nAnd before she could say another word she vanished. \n\n\"No! Wait! Please, bring her back!\" I hadn't seen my mother in so long, and to be torn away from her so quickly was devastating.\n\n\"THE THIRD JUDGE - HE WHO YOU SAVED.\" \n\nA man I'd never seen before appeared, and I was very confused. I didn't recall ever saving anyone before, let alone this stranger. \n\nHe smiled and looked somewhat astonished. \"Wow, I never thought I'd ever see you again. I've thought about you every so often throughout my life. I'm really glad I have a chance to thank you after all this time. So, thank you. \" \n\nI shook my head. \"I'm really sorry, but I don't remember you.\" \n\n\"Oh, I'm not surprised. You sat next to me in a bus for no more than ten minutes. I was going through a rough time in my life, and I was planning on killing myself when I got home. I had everything planned out, and I was writing down my suicide note on that bus when you suddenly asked me if I was a writer. I confessed about how I always wanted to be one, and you asked me what I liked to write about. Well, I ended up telling you about a story that I always wanted to make into a novel, and you said it sounded amazing. You told me I should do it, that I *could* do it. Well, I decided to hold off my suicide until after I finished my book.\"\n\nI got excited. \"And you decided not to kill yourself because your book was a huge success?\" \n\nHe laughed. \"Nope. Never actually finished it. I hit a writer's block, so I joined a writing group where I made a few friends, and through them met the love of my life. We had six children, and had up to eight grandchildren before I died. So yeah, you definitely have my vote.\" \n\nJust like that he was gone, and my heart swelled. I had no idea I had ever made such an impact on anyone in my life. \n\nBut my joy was short lived when I heard what the voice said next. \n\nYOUR FINAL JUDGE - HE WHO DIED BY YOUR CHOICE. \n\nI couldn't believe it. Had I killed someone without ever knowing?? \n\nI never would have guessed in a million years who it was. \n\nIt was Steve, my cat. \n\n\"Oh, *Steve*...\" and I could feel the tears come. I had Steve for twenty-three years, and loved him like family. He *was* family, especially during the dark times with my ex husband. He eventually got cancer, and when I  realized how much pain he was in, I had him put to sleep. I cried everyday for month, and would tear up every so often thinking about him for the rest of my life. \n\n\"I'm so sorry, Steve. There was nothing I could do...I didn't want you to suffer...\"\n\nAnd I finally lost it. After seeing my ex, my mother, a stranger whose life was made better for having met me, and now Steve, I couldn't hold back my emotions anymore. \n\nI dropped to my knees, and sobbed into my hands. \n\nSo many questions ran through my mind. How could he possibly understand why I chose to have him euthanized? Did he even understand what had happened? How could he even vote? Was this whole system rigged?!\n\nI heard purring, and as I wiped my eyes I felt Steve rub against my side. Shaking, I picked him up, and cried more as he rubbed his head against mine over and over. \n\nThe voice spoke one last time. \n\n\"VOTES AGAINST - ONE - VOTES FOR - THREE. YOU MAY PROCEED.\" \n\nI was expecting something grandiose like angels popping up with fanfare, or giant golden gates appearing and opening up for me. \n\nInstead a very normal looking door appeared. \n\nAn indescribable joy washed over me.\" C'mon Steve, we better not keep Mom waiting.\"",

            "comment": "I've been waiting in the ghostly office for hours as they look through my file, guess something about it is out of the ordinary. Not sure what it could be honestly, I wasn't anything out of the ordinary as far as humans go. There are a few defining moments I could think of that may fit the categories they mentioned, but you rarely get to see the full impact of your actions so I have to guess.\n\nWho was I the most cruel too? Probably my Ex, that one is a no brainer. It was a rocky relationship from day one and after four years of struggling through it, the ending wasn't any better. My depression didn't allow for emotional connections and my job didn't give me the time to try and figure the rest out.\n\nThat would being me to the nicest. Do dogs count? I would love to see any of them again. All of them? Even thinking about them now makes me smile, and I doubt they would feel any different. Otherwise maybe a coworker? I treated everyone pretty evenly as far as I can remember. Rarely played favorites and if I did, it was merit based. \n\nSaving people, well I did that a ton technically. If you look back at my career as a doctor you would see countless lives saved through surgery. Hopefully that is what the gatekeeper was talking about. At least some are bound to remember me. \n\nBut killed? Hard question. Some didn't make it through operation, but I never really made a decision that killed them. They were just lost causes when they came in. Any one of those might count but I am not sure that I can be judged for that, even in purgatory. \n\nAfter hours of thinking, that was all I could come up with. My ex, some dogs, and patients. I didn't live a very social life now that I think about it. \n\nA door creaked open in the dimly lit corner across from me, guess my jury has arrived. Footsteps echo on the floor as they approach the table, but something is off.\n\n\"Your case was a unique one Dr.\" the gatekeepers voice whispers through the shadows, \"But we have found your judges.\"\n\n\"The person you were most cruel to,\" rang out as the seat on the left was illuminated, empty.\n\n\"The person you were most kind to,\" it continued, the next seat lighting up. Again, empty.\n\n\"The person whom you saved,\" the pattern continued. \n\n\"And the person whom you killed,\" no surprise, empty. \n\n\"But how is this possible?\" I asked, speaking to the empty room. \"I had to influence someone's life for better or worse.\"\n\n\"You did,\" a voice resonated from right behind the chairs. It sounded familiar, but I couldn't put a face to it. \n\n\"Your case was special because all four categories were fulfilled by the same person,\" The voice continued, sounding both hostile and kind at the same time. If I wasn't dead I would die right here from how fast my heart was beating. \n\n\"Hello son,\" my mother said as she stepped into the light from behind the chairs, \"It's about time we had this talk.\"",

I even apologized in my 20's... I hoped that would be enough to sway her vote.\n\nThe second, I was unsure about. Who had I been the nicest too? Was it some random person from my past. A passerby? A coworker? No. It was him. My elderly neighbour from my first apartment. The one I lived in for half a decade just after college. I always made time to say hi. I'd stop by to play checkers. I was there when his wife died. I didn't realize he thought so highly of me and my actions. As soon as I saw him, I knew I had his vote.\n\nThe third one caught me by surprise. It was famous doctor. An honest to goodness decent man who helped hundreds of people every year he practiced. He was much younger than me though. How did I save his life? What did I do? Then it hit me. I was working in the same town he grew up in. There was that night, right after the party. Will was drunk that night. Is Will his dad? No. That's not it. Will didn't drive that night. I hid his keys so he couldn't. If Will had left he would have killed his mother? He would have never existed? \n\nI'm still waiting on the fourth person. I've been waiting for centuries now. Has it been that long or is it longer? Time doesn't seem to exist here but the flow and feeling is ever so present.\n\nAt first, the gatekeeper would not answer my questions. \nWhy hasn't the final person shown up? They should long have died by now? Shouldn't they? \n\nFinally he spoke. Perhaps he had to get permission from whichever \"god\" controls this place. Perhaps he felt sorry for me. I may never know. \n\nWhat he said shook me to my core. What do you mean, we will never see the final person? How can they not have existed? How can the person who died from my actions be someone who never was? \n\nSo I wait. Thinking, pleading, praying. Praying that the gatekeeper is wrong. Pleading that they will make a decision. Working over my life's actions. Trying to figure out what I did or didn't do to have a person not exist; that a soul I needed to pass through the plane of existence was not created due to my actions. \n\nI don't know what is worse. Being in hell or being here but I know for certain this is my hell and there is no end in sight.",

            "comment": "PART 1/2  \n\n\nWhen we die, we stand before a jury of our own making. The person you were the most cruel to, the one you were nicest to, the one who was saved by your actions, and the one who died because of your choices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, I knew all this. Because I have already gone through it. Twice, in fact, when I wound up with a hung jury the first time. In the end, I was chosen to stay in Purgatory itself. I was too complicated of a case, apparently. Not because I am a deep and interesting person, but because I was just too dull for anyone from either jury to have formed a solid opinion about me. All that is behind me now. All you need to know is that I work in Purgatory, helping set people up with their juries and helping make sure that the jury's judgement is interpreted correctly and upheld as best possible. Sometimes the jury wants something that is not fair, or not possible, you see? Sometimes there is a hung jury, as there was with me, and we start over. My mediocrity, my lack of emotion for anyone or anything, and my total apathy towards life and even towards the afterlife has made me a perfect fit for that job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot so much for this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see, I was murdered. Brutally and without compassion. And now that my murderer is deceased, I have been selected from among his many victims to represent those who died due to his choices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalking into the main court building, I feel a sense of nostalgia. I have not set foot outside of the Purgatory offices in decades. I suppose that the building is always the same. Or maybe every few centuries it is updated. The gleaming lights feel more like an airport than like a courtroom *or* the afterlife. And they are so bright after working for so long in the near darkness of the filing rooms and my office. I haven't slept the whole time. I do not need to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTaking my seat in the chair marked with our symbol for \"dead\", I see that the other three have not yet arrived. I take my time to look at the man before me. He is much older than I remember. I open the case file they have given me for him. Sometimes the person who was killed needs a bit of a refresher. I moreso than most, seeing as I never knew him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see, I worked at a grocery store checkout. I'd seen my fair share of crime, from petty theft to being held at gunpoint, from assaults to people shooting up in the staff-only bathroom. If only he had been so common, perhaps I wouldn't even need to read this file. But no, he had just walked in one day, drawn a knife, and put it right between my ribs. I died virtually instantly. And all these years, all these decades, I never thought to wonder why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis file seems like more of a sob story than anything else. Had mine read like this? Did the files on the other seats have the same story? Or was this supposed to draw some sympathy out of me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Travis Simmons. Born 1933. Died 2018.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Born to a couple who were father and daughter, the latter being underage, from a long line of incest, Travis had countless defects from birth. The most severe of which being hydrocephaly. The cult he was born into did not want their existence nor their incestuous ways to be revealed, so they simply condemned him as bearing the mark of Satan. For this his mother was executed, a fact which would only come to light fifteen years later, when the compound was discovered and raided. Raised by his father/grandfather, Travis was considered to be slow, but they never knew the physical or mental extent of his suffering. With no schooling and no medical tests, many perfectly reversible (even in the 70s and 80s) conditions he suffered from were allowed to develop into worse and worse iterations. At one point the symptoms became so severe that his father manually castrated him, to prevent him from reproducing, and set him to live with the barn animals.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*It was only in 1948 that he was discovered during the raid. He had no capacity for speech, and his carers throughout countless institutions could not determine if he had ever been able to speak in the first place. He was diagnosed with countless mental illnesses, but the most important of which, PTSD, was missed for too long. Eventually, as he seemed like a peaceful soul without a personality or identity, he was integrated into the community alongside a team of carers in 1985. It was shortly after this that he escaped their care, killing one of them and damaging several others in the process. You were one of many casualties of this one, lone rampage he went on before he was recaptured and returned to an institution, where he lived out the rest of his days in relative peace.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a short file, but it seemed it had to be. Looking at the attached medical records, it was clear that Travis here had barely been born with a brain at all, much less a capacity for rebellion. His one rampage was a fluke of sorts. And they were relying on his upbringing to persuade me he was not wholly bad deep down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurious, I reached over into the seat of the chair marked \"life\". Only for my hand to meet the plush fabric of the seat. Looking down and across, I saw that the other files were absent. I looked down at Travis, who looked up at me with nearly vacant eyes, shaking, scared by his own confusion, his face a mass of wrinkles and scars. In those nearly endless folds, I began to make out the face of the man who had murdered me for no reason, for no purpose. The face of a brutal killer, whatever the higher ups wanted to tell me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lights dimmed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Judgement shall commence,\" boomed The Voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Wait, wait!\" I exclaimed. \"Hold up, the others aren't here yet!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"There are no others,\" The Voice said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"But... He affected nobody so as to save their lives?\" I asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"He did not,\" The Voice replied. \"He took countless lives, yours most directly, but he saved nobody.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Very well, then one of those lives should be the person he was most cruel to?\" I press.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"No, he was never cruel. He does not have the capacity for cruelty,\" The Voice replied. \"Nor has he the capacity for kindness. Nor premeditation. Nor love or hate. He feels nothing but the most basic of instincts.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI froze in the spot. I had not expected this. But I had to trust The Voice, the only arbiter present who knew all there was to know about the defendant. I looked down at Travis, who seemed either oblivious to the booming Voice and the argument taking place, or lost in his own nearly animalistic mind. \"So what am I expected to do?\"",

He still experiences joy and anger and fear. He may be limited to those experiences a soul can have without a mind, but it is a complete human soul nonetheless. And you are the only person qualified to judge him.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I can't do that!\" I shouted into the void. \"How can I make this decision all by myself? I barely know him. I knew him from a few seconds before he killed me and from this piece of fucking paper right here.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Then judge him from what you know,\" The Voice said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew it would say no more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSinking back into my seat, I looked from the file to the old man before me. I closed my eyes and pictured the moment I died, his expression a combination of terror and blankness. He had not motivation. No reason to hurt me. He did hurt me, but he never hurt a soul before that day, or since. He never planned to hurt me, much less kill me, and I was the person he had most directly murdered.   \n\n\nI open my eyes and look up at the ceiling. \"Very well, I have my decision.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"So soon?\" The Voice boomed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I didn't exactly have much to base it on. Besides, there are more files in my office, waiting to be matched up,\" I replied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Very well, what have you chosen?\" The Voice asked. \"This is your final sentence for Travis Simmons. It will be carried out as you command.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I have chosen Purgatory,\" I replied. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSilence reigned for a few seconds. Even The Voice, the arbiter who knows all our past, had apparently not anticipated this. Only the One Above could have known, I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"If that is your choice,\" The Voice boomed back. \"And yet, now it is final... why?\"  \n\n\nI shrug. \"I am the only person who could judge him. I suppose that means I am the only person who can understand him. To send him to Heaven or Hell would just be cruel and lonely, would it not? So he can spend eternity with me. Perhaps, now his soul is not bound to a body without a brain, he can develop in ways he had never dreamed of. I would hate to send a developing soul, a spiritual baby, basically, to live among people who do not understand it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"He murdered you,\" The Voice said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I know. And even so, he did not intend to. He intended nothing. Why should I curse a developing soul for the crimes it committed whilst permanently trapped in the body of a fetus?\" I insisted.   \n\n\n\"Then surely he is pure enough for Heaven?\" The Voice pressed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Heaven would be another Hell to him, should he develop. He would be surrounded by people who are not ravaged by his past life. If none of the people present in Heaven today can sit in one of these seats and judge him, then how could I ask him to be judged by them for all of eternity?\" I insist. \"Imagine developing surrounded by people who can never understand you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"And if he does not develop? If he remains as he is forever?\" The Voice asks as the shackles release from Travis's wrists and ankles and he stands up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI shrug and hold a hand out to Travis. He smiles faintly, almost knowingly, and begins to shuffle towards me. \"Then that will be good enough,\" I reply.",

            "comment": "John was happily driving his car to meet up with some family, when suddenly-- BAM! He couldn't really remind himself of what had happened, however, he was now sitting down, in a dimly lit room.\n\n\"Where am I?\" John blurted out, looking around before finally looking down at his body and noting how perfectly fine he was. No bruises, cuts or scratches. - \"B-But.. the accident?\"\n\nHe had no answers and seemingly there was no one else around to do so. \n\nMinutes turned into hours and, soon enough, a door cracked open. John went wide-eyed and even rubbed his eyes furiously, not really believing who now stood there, right in front of him.\n\n\"Hey-..\" - A sort of squeakish voice greeted.\n\n\"This isn't possible- How? What?\" - John rubbed his eyes once more and sighed before looking up at the figure once more. \"You're me. Younger, but still, me.\" - In front of him now stood teenager John, the person he had been the most cruel to.\n\nThroughout highschool John had dealt with various problems and his solution to it all was pretty much, well, some questionable choices. He hadn't allowed himself to be good to his own self and that now reflected on the him that was peering down at, well, himself. The teenager didn't really ask too much. He woud just peer down at John and shake is head from side to side before finally speaking a few words in a low, monotone voice.\n\n\"You could've reached out to someone.\"\n\nAs soon as that was said, the figure seemingly disappeared and John was once again left alone with his own thoughts.\n\nAfter another couple of hours the door cracked open once again and someone else walked out from it. \"Hello, John.-\"\n\nAt this moment the poor man was sobbing, hands against his hand and even slightly rocking his body back and forth. \"T-This has to be a dream.. a really bad one.\" - He noted before looking down and back up at who stood there, smiling, right in front of him. It was another John, however a seemingly old one, probably on his college years.\n\n\"I'm glad you managed to overcome those feelings of guilt..- It wasn't your fault.\"\n\nThose words sent a deep, lightning fast shiver down John's spine and, once again, after professing those words, the figure disappeared.\n\nAnother couple of hours passed and, as if by sacred ritual, the door opened once more.\n\n\"Let me guess, it's me..-\" John blurted out sarcastically.\n\nAnd indeed, as precise as clockwork, John came out again! However, it was his college self, once again.\n\nThe figure smiled and simply nodded his head a few couple of times before leaning forward and placing his hands on John's shoulder. - \"I'm glad you didn't jump.-\"\n\nAnd with that, the figure disappeared once more.\n\nFinally, John got up and walked towards the door. He had had enough of that attrocity. Was it divine punishment? Perhaps, but only that way could he either ascend or descend. Once he got close enough to the door, the man grabbed the knot and twisted it open. Inside, only a mirror which reflected his own self.\n\nJohn sighed and closed his eyes. When he opened them back up-- Heaven.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Well, this was my first try at writing a prompt! It probably isn't much, but I hope you enjoy it! )",

            "comment": "I stood there, looking at them. Two women, a friend betrayed and a lover coveted. They both grew up in harsh conditions, worse than I could endure.\n\nI took advantage of the firsts weakness and unloaded all my dissatisfaction and malice into her, constantly tearing her down while holding onto her as a friend to ensure I wasn't alone. I saw her cries for help and took them as openings to empower myself instead. I rendered our friendship superficial to the extent that I abandoned her on a whim, to prove a point about my apathy. She began a downward spiral through her drug abuse, partying, stripping, and prostitution until she overdosed one final time. She died before her life could start, before she could finish school, before she could find happiness - because of me.\n\nThe second I saw her weakness as an invitation to help. I took all of my apathetic tendencies and narcissism and pushed past them for her. While she needed to grow and process her abuse, I held onto her because I saw her happiness as an extension of my own; the source of it infact. But through her suffering, I suffered. I grew and began to understand the toxic nature of my dependency. Out of the ruins of the first iteration of our relationship something real blossomed, a mutual understanding and love for one another. I helped her process her past and put the blade down. I supported her and by elevating her, I matured myself. She found a career, made memories, and overcame the odds to find happiness - because of me. \n\nI think both of them suspected, or perhaps knew, how I felt because in unison they spoke.\n\n*\"You aren't the world, let alone our world. While you're responsible for aspects of our lives, things set in motion  by our childhoods, our friends, our jobs, and ourselves don't involve you.\"*\n\nThe first step forward.\n\n*\"While you hurt me, badly, you alone weren't what set me on the path I chose. You were young and naive, unaware of the power words hold. The kindness you've shown others in life will never redeem you of your actions towards me, but those actions won't alone tarnish your soul.\"*\n\nShe stepped back, as the second moved forward. \n\n*\"Our relationship was one of the most important aspects of my life. You gave me somewhere to hide from the loneliness and dark memories when I couldn't chase them away. But you give yourself too much credit, I'm strong enough on my own. Your help will always be appreciated, though I would have survived without. You've committed no true evils in your life, but you've committed nothing on the other end of the scale either.\"*\n\n\nShe stepped back, leaving me to stand in silence. They began to fade, along with the walls. My vision began to blur and my head spin.\n\n*\"Wait, no! Come back! You can't leave me!\"*\n\nNothing. Perhaps this is just. I donated to protect the forest and ocean, but not my fellow man. I gave spare change, while squandering hundreds on leisure. I urged equality without action. I practiced nihilism while preaching collectivism. \n\n*\"You are worthy of a second chance at obtaining eternity. Your missteps are not beyond salvation and kindness comes in many forms, regardless of motivation.\"*\n\nSuddenly I'm 15 again.",

            "comment": "The branches of the trees hung heavy and thick above me. The sun struggled to light the path, scattered beams dancing across the damp earth as the foliage swayed in the breeze.\n\nMy lungs burned. I couldn\u2019t remember how long I had been walking, but I wish I had worn better shoes. My sneakers were wet and starting to soak through. I slowed to catch my breath and wipe the beading sweat from my brow. The mud was thick and the path narrow; the canopy captured so much moisture in the air it was difficult to breathe. The canopy captured the moisture in the air, made it dense and hot. The path was poorly trodden; no creature had come this way for some time. Leafy limbs dangled in front and behind, sharing the dew they had collected since morning. I pressed on.\n\nIt had been some time since I set out. It must have been since I had no memory of my origin. Come to think of it, I had no knowledge of my destination. I just knew the order of my steps, one in front of the other. Ordinarily, this would have terrified me, but today it just felt normal. I didn\u2019t know because I couldn\u2019t know. At least that is what my gut told me. \n\nAfter a time, I could not say how long, the forest began to thin. I could see a small clearing ahead, a clearing and movement. A shadow, slimmer and shorter than mine, drifted between the gaps in the trees. There was something else, a soft sound on the wind. At first, it was incomprehensible, a rhythmic buzzing under the weight of my steps and the drag of the branches. As I neared, it became clearer. It was a gentle humming. A melody I had not heard for some time. Then a voice.\n\n\u201cThe other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms.\u201d Then more humming, followed by singing, followed by humming. \u201c...hung my head and I cried.\u201d The voice was familiar to me, soothing. As I came into the clearing and had my first good look at the shadow, what breathe I had escaped me.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d\n\nShe sighed, \u201cThere you are. Always in your own time.\u201d She gestured to the side and I truly took in the clearing for the first time. The path opened slightly into a small patch of grass and a break in the tree cover. Clear sky let a gentle sun shine down onto a weathered and worn picnic table. A large, plastic container sat to one end, its spigot hanging over the edge. Two tall glasses sat alongside. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d I did not move. \u201cYou want some sun tea?\u201d she asked, walking across the clearing to the table.\n\n\u201cMom, wh-,\u201d I had started speaking before organizing my thoughts. It had been so long. But how is that possible? I am only\u2026\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not as young as you think.\u201d She looked different than I last remembered. In my mind her hair was thinner, he steps shallow, and her frame thinner. She shuffled along. But here she moved assuredly; she was a little rounder and her skin smoother. She finished pouring both glasses, set one on each side of the table, took her seat, wiped her hands on her jeans, and gestured for me to sit, \u201cCome on. We\u2019ve got to talk and we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom, I\u2019ve missed you so much,\u201d I walked to my glass and straddled the bench, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to sit. I leaned forward, putting all my weight on both hands, \u201cIt\u2019s been hard without you. Why does it feel so long?\u201d\n\nShe placed her hand atop mine, \u201cI know. I wish we had more time. Time enough for me to explain,\u201d gesturing around her, \u201cthis.\u201d She paused and took a deep breath. \u201cCome on; sit down and drink your tea.\u201d She smiled. Her smile looked the same. \u201cThis is a waypoint, before what comes next,\u201d keeping one hand atop mine she waived the other gently as if dismissing a question I hadn\u2019t asked, \u201cI know this doesn\u2019t make any sense right now, but it will in time. Honey,\u201d she exhaled, \u201cyou died. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. You lived a long life, a good life.\u201d She wiped away the tears that were rolling down her face. \u201cAnd she was there with you, in the end. I hoped she would be.\u201d She paused, finally taking her hand from mine. She used both to dry her face.\n\n\u201cI, uhm,\u201d I stammered, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m not\u2026 I don\u2019t feel old. I feel\u2026\u201d\n\nShe interrupted, \u201cYoung. I know. You feel young. You look, you feel the way you want to here, at least for a time.\u201d Suddenly, she stopped talking and hung her head. She nodded like she was listening to something then she turned toward the trees, \u201cOkay. I know. I know. We\u2019re getting there.\u201d Looking back toward me, \u201cHoney, something is about to happen. As I said, this is a waypoint. You cannot get to where you are going without passing through here. In a minute, I\u2019m going to leave,\u201d I tried to speak but she hastily reached forward cupping both hands atop mine, \u201cplease just listen. I am going to leave and you will meet four spirits. They come together and before you they decide your path out. I do not know their names. I do not know their faces. But they will be the one to whom you were cruelest, the one to whom you were kindest, the one you saved, and,\u201d she sighed and nodded, \u201cthe one you killed.\u201d She squeezed my hands tightly, \u201cNow quickly. Close your eyes. When you open them again, I will be gone and they will stand in judgment.\u201d \n\nI shook my head, subtly at first and then violently. I would not say good-bye. Mom implored me, \u201cCome on now. Shut them tight; I have to go.\u201d Tears streaming down my face, I lowered my head, gritted my teeth, and closed my eyes. I felt her hands grow heavy upon mine, a kiss on the forehead, and then nothing.  I sat in silence for a time, trying to quiet my racing mind, waiting for someone to bid me open my eyes. Nothing came. No one called out. There were no footsteps or voices. Just the sound of wind in trees. \n\nI slowly opened my eyes. She was gone, but, in all other ways, the world seemed unchanged. I looked around. There was no one. The canopy of the forest darkened all around the clearing. My tea sat untouched and a gentle sun illuminated drew beads of sweat upon the glass.\n\nThen I saw her sitting on the earth on the other side of the table. I saw her sitting as only one can in the pristine form of memory, soft doe eyes, stout body, and stubby legs. When our eyes finally connected she hopped to all four feet; her tailed wagged so vigorously her body wiggled and wormed. I rolled to the dirt, sat with my legs out outstretch and patted the earth between them.\n\nShe dashed around the table and rolled herself into the V between legs. I ran my fingers through her fur and scratched deeply on her chest and neck. She felt exactly as I remembered all those years ago.\n\nAnd I wept.",

One I'd been kindest to. Cruelest. One I'd saved. And one I'd doomed.\n\nThe figure walks out, the doors shut. The light is gone. My breath catches. A new light emerges.\n\n*Grace.*\n\nAlone she could light up the room. I watch as she walks towards me, her form tall and full of grace and poise. That easy smile breaks on her face and for a moment I remember. Distant echoes. The music from lives that intertwined seamlessly.\n\n*Grace. The only woman I ever loved.*\n\nI stumble to my feet, my movements as awkward as a newborn babe's. She's closer now. 10? No, 5 meters away. The gap between us fades, and the strain of faint music enters.\n\n*Grace. The woman I lost 15 years ago.*\n\nI say no words. Neither does she. We stand there, face to face, my eyes memorizing each of her features.\n\nShe takes my hand, and slides her thin body close to mine, the way a bow touches a violin. I hold her. And before I even know it, we move. The music rises and sweeps us into a slow dance. The room spins, and somehow unfolds like a box opening, and the room cannot contain us and all at once we are bursting and flying among the sparkling sky, a couple dancing among the stars.\n\n\"So this is nice.\" My voice manages not to break.\n\nShe smiles, her green eyes glowing brightly in the dark.\n\n\"You always did say you wanted to take me to someplace gorgeous.\" She teases. \"I guess this counts.\"\n\nI smile, but my insides flutter. That's right. I'd always wanted to take her someplace amazing.\n\n*Always wanted to. Always wanted to...*\n\nThe slightest pause, a burr in the flow of our dance as I flinch. Memories pop and spill like a bottle of uncorked wine.\n\n*Nights in the hospital. Holding your hand. Looking up. Wishing I had more time with you. Wishing I'd kept my promise.*\n\nI smile, but she shakes her head.\n\n\"I know you better than that, love.\" She says. \"You always did have a nasty habit of pretending you were fine.\"\n\n\"I...\" I try. The words are raw. Laced with subtle pain, words that cut through my heart as I pronounce them. \"I wish I'd treated you better. I wish I'd taken you to more places. I wish I'd hugged you more.\"\n\nThe music halts. The dance ends. The stars blink away.\n\n\"I wish I'd loved you more.\"\n\nShe blurs within my vision, and it takes me a second to realise its because of my tears. She raises a gentle hand to my eyes, and wipes.\n\n\"I have never once felt unloved in my time with you, John.\" She says, her voice like streaming honey. \"Never once have i regretted being with you. My whole life all I've known from you is love and kindness.\"\n\nShe holds my chin and gently tips my eyes to meet hers. Brown eyes with specks of golden sunshine.\n\n\"Maybe you couldn't take me to places like Paris or New York or Sydney or Iceland or-\"\n\nI laugh and she smiles a little. She squeezes my hand.\n\n\"But with you, any place is like this.\"\n\nThe stars fall back into place. The music resumes. And we dance in the deep of the night, our heads leaned against each other, the most beautiful place and woman I've ever known.",

Time was nothing, but I still felt it pass. \n\nPurgatory. Bollocks.\n\n\"I probably deserve this.\" That was my first thought. Always one to self-deprecate I suppose. Nevertheless, I could make good use this place. or lack of place. \n\nI sat there, stewing in my mind, playing with scenarios like I always did, contemplating things, drifting in and out of my familiar depressive habits. I'd gotten rid of those years ago, with some help, but when all you have are your memories and imagination, things tend to repeat. \n\n*Light.*\n\nI shut my eyes to halt the blinding rays, not that it did me much good. The all-encompassing grandness that I was within could not be held back. Then again, I don't suppose I had eyelids at that point. \n\nThen it was gone.\n\n*Home.*\n\nMy childhood home, where I felt my best and worst. I'd moved on, of course, but this would always be my happy place, my place of comfort. I felt a physical sensation run through me, and realized I could walk, so I did. I went back to my bedroom, and sat on my bed, the cool sheets and duvet a reminder of what I'd been through. Life. I had been through life. \n\n\"I never understood why.\" I turned left, to my desk chair. Ah. That is not who I would have expected to see. I'd rather hoped never to see them again. My shame was enough of a punishment, their face was an uncomfortable reminder of the worst aspects of myself. Perhaps this was purgatory, that sempiternal grey room left me to my own thoughts after all, it wasn't all bad. \n\n\"Negative. Positive. Death. Life. I am the first.\"\n\nOh goody. I'd have to deal with three more. At least the two of them sounded okay.\n\n\"You were so unkind to me. Your own father. You said things that made me hurt inside in ways that no one could. I never understood. I couldn't. But now I do. And I forgive you. I have seen all that you saw. Felt all that you felt. And It's okay. I love you.\"\n\nAnd he was gone. \n\nAnd she was there. \n\n\"Mum.\" My tears hurt. I didn't want to see her again, I knew it would hurt too much. \n\n\"My beautiful, baby boy. Come here.\" I launched myself into her arms, holding back screams as I cried. I held her for an eternity. \n\n\"Shh. It's okay. It's all fine. I missed you so much. I love you. You made me so happy. So, so, happy. Every memory spent with you, even at your worst, is one I will cherish forever.\"  \n\nAnd she was gone. \n\nI wasn't ready.\n\nI never was. \n\nNot then. \n\nNot now. \n\nNot ever.\n\nI screamed. \n\nMinutes past. I stared at the floor, kneeling before the desk chair  she had arrived on. I looked up again. \n\n\"Grandad?\" I didn't understand. He'd died when I was five, I barely recognized him. But I knew. I'd loved him unconditionally, before disease stole him from us. \n\n\"You don't understand. I didn't either, not at first. Eventually I realized though. I had to look deep into my mind, but I found out why. I found out why it was you fault.\"\n\n\nNo. NO. It couldn't have been my fault, I was a child, barely a toddler. Cancer took him. How could it be MY FAULT?!\n\n\"Your mother told you this, I believe. When you were but a babe, I held you up, and I saw something unbelievable. I looked into your eyes and it looked like you knew something I didn't. Like you'd been there before. I didn't even believe in that kind of stuff, but I still told your Gran, that feeling was so strong. And I was right. You had a second chance. A chance to give warning, so everything wouldn't be stolen from you too soon... But you forgot. It wasn\u2019t fair, and I will never hold it against you. But your choice to forget, to live it all again, it did this. And I'm so glad you chose that. Nobody should bear the weight you would have carried. You did the right thing. I love you.\" \n\nHe was gone. I didn't understand. \n\nI sat back on my bed and stewed in my thoughts. I don't know how long I thought for before it stuck. Before I understood. \n\nA second chance. And I didn't take it. \n\n*Why?*\n\nI didn't know. But I understood now. \n\nCruelty. Kindness. Death... \n\nWhere was life. \n\nI felt weak. Empty. Far more empty than in that empty box even. I was missing something. \n\nI turned grey. \n\nI waited. One more had to come. They HAD to, right?\n\n*Wrong.*\n\nNot everyone saves a life. Not everyone causes a death. Some of us just live. we are, then we are not. And at the end, we are missing something. A fundamental piece of the puzzle. I had three pieces. But I had never collected the fourth. I had never saved a life. And so, I could never finish it. Finish this. \n\n*I understood.*\n\nAnd I crumbled to dust. \n\nAnd nothing is left of what once was. \n\n*I understand.*\n\nNothing.",

            "comment": "\"What's wrong with you?\" The sinewy, hairless creature stood next to him -- his only friend in purgatory. \"You've waited centuries for the chance to be judged.\" Its long fingers wrapped around his shoulder in comfort. \"This is your chance to cross over.\" The creature smiled at him.\n\n\"But...\" He let out a breath. \"I'd be leaving you behind too.\"\n\nThe creature's sallow face flushed. \"You know my time will come,\" it paused and took a breath. \"Eventually.\"\n\nFinally, he and the creature looked at the empty void that Jaron must pass through to receive his ultimate judgement. So many had passed through before them. Few returned and the rest were sent on their way to either side. \"You know you must do this.\" The creature put a gentle hand on Jaron's lower back and urged him to move forward. \"C'mon.\" It spoke softly towards the void, facing away from Jaron. \"We don't know how long the doorway will stay open.\"\n\nJaron let out a final breath before moving forward. A lump formed in his throat and he looked back at the nameless creature that accompanied him for almost his entire time in Purgatory. \"I'll miss you.\"\n\nThe world behind him darkened as the void grew nearer. The boundary between Purgatory and The Final Judgement was hazy, but one could not turn back once they entered the boundary. The creature was already entirely obscured, which was not surprising. Its spirit had remained in purgatory for much longer than Jaron's; its spirit was too weak and hazy to shine through the boundary.\n\nFor a moment, things only became darker. Soon, though, a grey light emanated around him and the room came into focus. He knew for certain of only one person that was going to be on the other side.\n\nHe stopped. The room came to him. *Three* people turned to face him, and his own face lit up in surprise. He knew only one person, and the rest were a mystery.\n\nImmediately, his father rushed up to greet him. \"Jaron!\" His eyes welled up. \"I am so happy to see you again, after so long!\" He hugged Jaron and sobbed. His father was covered in ash and his eyes were red. Jaron held him tightly, relieved that his father's scent was still there.\n\n\"I am so happy to see you father.\" There was a clatter behind Jaron. He turned to see a chair. He quickly sat down. His heart was racing.\n\nChairs appeared behind the others, and they sat down as well. To Jaron's left sat a man he had never seen before. He had a square jaw and light brown stubble. His hair grew wild. His father was to his right and in between them sat a wide-eyed adolescent.\n\nThe atmosphere changed. Jaron lost the ability to speak and each individuals' eyes started to glow softly in the muted light. His father spoke first.\n\n\"You left me.\" His voice reverberated across the room, which had no boundary. \"For years, I tried to maintain contact with you, but I was met with silence.\" Tears streamed down his face faster. The ash that covered him ran down as well, revealing fresh skin underneath. \"I was alone for years without you.\"\n\nHis voice echoed for several long seconds, and Jaron's voice came, unbidden, from his mouth. He was speaking the truth and could not prevent himself from doing so. \"You were an awful father.\" Anger found its way into his voice. \"You stole my sister's pain medication when she got out of surgery.\" Memories of her accident came to mind. He remembered her wailing in pain after the medication went missing. He remembered the small tap on the door, followed by a revving engine, when he opened the door and saw the bottle on the floor with not so much as a single dose of her medication and some half-assed excuse for why he took it. \"You left her to suffer to satisfy your own addiction.\" His eyes hardened. The joy of seeing a familiar face from just moments ago had vanished. He remembered why he hated him. \"You only lived for yourself.\"",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s been about 3 months since I\u2019ve died. I accidentally ate poisoned cereal. I went the way I wanted I guess. My name is Bob. Bob Smith. For some reason everybody calls me bland. I was an office drone. And I had a wife named Susan, with two kids named James and John. \n\nI think I see something... in the distance. I floated over there. I was transported into some sort of space thingy. I wasn\u2019t very smart so I don\u2019t know much about astrology. It\u2019s a door... I grasped the knob and twisted it open. I saw four platforms, and what looked like to be a courtroom. There wasn\u2019t any walls or anything. It was just white in here. \n\nThe door was gone when I looked behind me. Huh, am I in trouble? I walked closer and what I saw made me gasp. Four people, who I knew when I was still alive.\n\nCarlos, my coworker who was in the first stand. Susan, my wife in the second stand. My good friend, Percy in the third stand. And finally, my mom in the fourth stand. There was an angel in front of the stands, and when he saw me he smiled.\n\n\u201cGreetings, Bob Smith!\u201d He exclaimed. \u201cI am Frares, a frenchman who stopped an orphanage from burning down in Paris!\u201d I raised my eyebrow. \u201cHow come I\u2019m here?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, that is the question they all ask.\u201d Frares replied. \u201cThese are the four who you have impacted the most in your mortal life.\u201d He continued\n\n\u201cThe man in the first stand, the one you have cruelest to. The woman in the second stand, the one you have been the nicest to. The man in the third stand, the one saved by your actions. The woman in the final stand, the one who has died because of you.\u201d Frares said.\n\nI looked at all four, and they looked back. \n\nCarlos started to talk, \u201cHello Bob, it seems that I\u2019m the judge for your afterlife.\u201d He greeted. \u201cYou\u2019re really boring you know. The worst thing you\u2019ve ever done to me was how you ate the muffin I was saving for lunch.\u201d He continued. I thought back to that time. I was getting extra rumblies from my tumblies. \u201cI understand you were hungry, and it was... very minor. I forgive you my friend, and I hope you reach Heaven.\u201d He smiled. At least, I think he did. He did a little smug look then a frown and then a pokerface. \n\nSusan, my wife, looked at me and smiled. \u201cMy dear, It\u2019s been a while.\u201d She said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done... nice things to me before. The best thing you\u2019ve done to me was give me my first kiss in 1987.\u201d She continued. \u201cI obviously hope you go to Heaven.\u201d\n\nPercy looked at me and sighed. \u201cWe did a lot of crazy things, huh Bob?\u201d \n\n\u201cLike when we ate an entire watermelon together.\u201d He said. \u201cYou saved my life when you told me not go on a date with that girl, Janet.\u201d I blinked. \u201cTurns out she was a mentally ill murderer.\u201d Oh. \u201cI hope you go to Heaven.\u201d \n\nFrares smirked and spoke up. \u201cWell, three votes mean you\u2019re going to Heaven. Would you like to hear the last madam?\u201d Frares said. \u201cOh, yeah sure.\u201d I replied.\n\nMy mom looked at me and smiled widely. \u201cWell, it turns out I died because of you my son.\u201d She said. I thought back to the time when she died. Oh, I pulled the plug because she was sick. \u201cI hope you remember, because I want you to know it wasn\u2019t your fault. It was my time.\u201d Mom said. \u201cI want you to go to Heaven.\u201d\n\nI looked at Frares. \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to Heaven, my bland friend. Bye bye!\u201d He yelled, and I started to float up. I waved down to my old friends and I looked up. \n\nHeaven, here I come.",

            "comment": "All I knew throughout my life were two things: poker and prison.\n\nPoker was kind to me and poker was cruel. Prison was just mainly cruel.\n\nI met my wife in Vegas after I won a high stakes Texas Hold \u2018Em bout. I met my daughter through the thick, plated glass in the state penitentiary. Those two moments\u2013those two people\u2013 changed me more than any other ever could. But two things remained. Poker and prison.\n_____________________________________________\n\nAs I folded my hand for the fifth time, Death seemed to be enjoying himself. Was he Death? I don\u2019t know. Seemed like an okay guy. Maybe I jumped to conclusions to quickly. He reeked of death, but that son-of-a-bitch knew how to play poker. We sat in an empty casino. Nothing was outside and all the lights were off, but it wasn\u2019t dark. The outside was more empty than the inside though. Not black, just *nothing*. Like what your eyes see in the blind spot. What your eyes see in the back of your head. Nothin\u2019. Not sure how long I\u2019d been There, but it felt like a while. We\u2019d only played 10 hands but it felt like years, maybe decades. I tried to ask him how long or why we were There, but he had a pretty good poker face and a mouth that didn\u2019t move for anything but his cigar. Very mysterious guy. Short and stubby fella. If he\u2019d had a nationality, I bet it\u2019d be Italian. How do you say death in Italian? Morte, I think.\n\nEventually we reached what must\u2019ve been our 40th or so round and he finally finished his cigar. He tossed the last bit aside and as it went through the floor, He took off his sunglasses and stood up, folding his hand. Lucky for me he didn\u2019t know I had nothing but a high card of 8. Nonetheless I was relieved we were done playing. I didn\u2019t care much for poker at that point. He had eyes of steel as he explained to mine what was happening. Heat death of the universe. All life in all galaxies vanished, as did every atom to ever exist. Every proton and every quark. Every plant and every animal. Every Ace and every king. Either I had been There a lot longer than expected, or the heat death of the universe happened a lot sooner than we all expected. Global warming, maybe?\n\n Mr. Morte went on to explain that God was fair. Therefore, at the end of time he gave us all a fair and speedy trial in front of a jury of our peers to determine our place through eternity. The peers weren\u2019t randomly selected, though. I had experience being in front of juries, had a lot of experience in prison too so that should tell you something about my experiences with juries. Maybe this would be my lucky break. 4 jurors: the person I\u2019ve hurt the most, the person I\u2019ve made the happiest, the person whose life ended through my actions, and the person whose life continued from my actions. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.\n\nI was a fairly good guy. Donated lots of my winnings to charity, spent a lot of time playing poker in my garage with a homeless guy that stayed around the curb, picked up trash in parks. Nobody is without their flaws though. Committed tax evasion more times than I should\u2019ve, threatened several bartenders\u2019 lives, not to mention I spent 25 years after Mary was born in a prison. I got to see her for the six months I was out though.\n\nThe jurors came one at a time, at the time their lives were most effected by my actions. The first juror was my wife. Shocker. She screamed and cussed in my face. She was the one I\u2019d cost the most pain. I knew what she\u2019d said, but I didn\u2019t listen. It was a lost cause. I loved that woman with all of my heart and she despised me. I couldn\u2019t blame her, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was all my fault. She had a drinking problem, so I\u2019d go play poker and bring Mary with me. I\u2019d leave her in the car with the A/C and radio on. Had an extra set of keys so I could keep the car running and the doors locked, with the car in view. There was parking lot security. I wasn\u2019t perfect, but I didn\u2019t want her growing up playing poker, and I wanted her to be safe. My wife left and Mr. Morte did not seem impressed with me. But as coach B always said, on to the next one.\n\nJuror number two was Nate, the homeless guy I played poker with. He told me I was the only person to ever show him love in his long and fulfilling life. After I died, he went on to get ordained, he even officiated my funeral. He got his pilots license and traveled the world. He spread the message of Christ through a little game called poker. Nate loved me. Mr Morte still seemed skeptical. On to the next one.\n\nThe third juror was the person\u2019s life I saved. I wasn\u2019t surprised when my baby Mary showed up. She couldn\u2019t speak. Just an infant. I saved her from her mother\u2019s drunk driving incident. She ran a red light and had a driver hit the rear passenger side. Mary would\u2019ve been sitting there had I not grabbed her and left when her mother wasn\u2019t looking. I stayed with her at the pub and put her in the back seat of my car. I knew she\u2019d be safe there. I went inside to finish my game of poker. Spent a few hours there to stay away from drunken love of my life.\n\nWhile at the pub, I decided to get a stuffed bear from the claw machine for Mary. I reached into my pocket to pull out some spare change. You can picture my horror when I realized I had both sets of car keys. When I got to the car it was too late. A car in the summertime is pretty hot after 3 hours. We buried her and my wife couldn\u2019t stomach me. It wasn\u2019t the child neglect that gave me 25 in the pen. My wife came at me with a knife 3 days after the funeral, and I put 3 rounds in her. Didn\u2019t kill her thankfully. But I still held a lot of hate in my heart. Had it not been for her drunken behavior, I wouldn\u2019t have been put in that situation. They wrote it off as attempted murder rather than self defense. I spent 25 of 30 behind bars. Drifted away in my sleep before the last five.\n\nSo it came as no surprise when the fourth juror, the one whose life I wasted, was also Mary. What did surprise me, was that it wasn\u2019t the Mary I knew. This was a grown woman. It was Mary if she had lived past that day. She held no hate for me. She was a successful salesperson at a local insurance agency. She said that things were going to look better. Had she survived that, I\u2019d have divorced her mom and moved her to Massachusetts. I\u2019d be a fisherman, done with the gambling and tax fraud. We\u2019d live happily ever after. I shouldn\u2019t feel guilty, she said. Guilt finds its way to you after you realize you prevented something really beautiful.\n\nMr Morte left and returned in what could\u2019ve been forever or no time at all. He said he spoke with the Big Guy. No place for me up There. No place for be down below. The good and the bad were pretty evenly matched. He said I can pick anywhere on earth to spend my eternity.\n\nWell I only knew two things, poker and prison. Pretty easy choice between the two.\n\nThree hots and a cot is as nice as it sounds. Mary didn\u2019t want me playing poker anymore.",

The lights, the smoke and fire, the police, the blood. At first, it was little hustles to put food on the table, and then big hustles to keep Saul in dialysis, and Lalo in school. Then getting gunned down like a dog in a filthy crackhouse, alone and scared.  \n\n\nNo one asked questions then. No one asked questions when I gave food to the community. No one snitched when my Organization gave backpacks and school supplies to kids. But then again, no one had the balls to say anything. Not after making a few examples. No one in the 'hood would dare bite the hand that fed them.\n\nNo one except mom. While I never spoke of my \"job\"; she knew. Moms know everything. I'd shower her with money and gifts and vacations, and she'd still make an off hand remark.

            "comment": "\u201cRun dear, run fast. Don't be scared, I'll be right behind you.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMother\u2019s voice was eerily calm. She cooed at me from all angles, tricking my brain into seeing her in the corner of my eye. But she was not there. She couldn\u2019t be. Not anymore.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou must stay strong, dear. Keep running.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMother was repeating herself. It was something she did now and again when she thought I wasn\u2019t listening hard enough. She must have thought it was encouraging.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere\u2019s no time to dilly-dally, dear.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI couldn\u2019t help but roll my eyes. I darted down the corridor and slid as I turned the corner. Sweat ran down my face and my clothes clung to my damp skin. My calves burned with pain.\r  \n\r  \nBehind me, something fast and hungry galloped, its body crashing against the walls as it raced down the narrow path.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMother had told me not to be scared but her incessant narration only added to my fear.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI know,\u201d I coughed. I pumped my arms in time with my legs, hoping to gain a few inches on the beast. My chest felt like it was filled with hot lead.\r  \n\r  \nWhatever was chasing me seemed to feel the strain as well. It gasped and choked on the stale air. \r  \n\r  \nI sped down a long straightaway and peeked behind me. Nothing. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cKeep running, dear. You know what happens if you turn back.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI stared down at my hands. My right was missing my ring and pinky fingers while my left lacked a pointer. The edges were clean and the scar tissue smooth. I kept running.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGood girl.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nA quiet rage built in my heart but I buried it like everything else. Mother knew best, right? Perhaps at some point, she had. But Mother had become something else now.\r  \n\r  \nAs I turned another corner, I saw a large red EXIT sign illuminate above a door at the end of the hall. I smiled. As I did, my pursuer missed the corner and slammed its enormous body into the wall. The sickly sweet stench of putrid meat filled the air. It roared at the sight of me.\r  \n\r  \nI kept my eyes on the EXIT sign as I ran. My pain and anger dissipated as my body vibrated with the instinct to survive. Adrenaline coursed through my veins. The door opened automatically as I neared and I threw myself through the threshold.\r  \n\r  \nThe creature reached out its long hairy arm to grab me. But the door shut on it. It squealed as the metal sliced through its limb. The arm fell to the ground.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell done, dear. Trial C47 is complete.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI panted and felt my legs go limp. Whatever had pushed them forward was now pouring through my skin. My ears rang and my head throbbed.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI told you there was no reason to be scared. I was with you the whole time.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMother\u2019s voice held a cold smugness to it. She was pleased with these results. I could imagine her thin lips pursed together in a tight smile, her eyes ravenous for more. I rolled my shoulders back.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat now?\u201d I asked hoarsely.\r  \n\u201cYou must rest. Please return to your quarters.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI pulled myself up and limped away from the Trial Arena. A team of cleaning robots pushed their way past me and began mopping up the mess.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDid it die?\u201d I asked.\r  \nNo response. I knew Mother had heard me. She hears everything. So when she doesn\u2019t answer, I know it\u2019s for a reason. What Mother didn\u2019t say felt more important than what she did.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cPlease return to your quarters, Daughter 032.\u201d",

Fangs pierced through her gums, her hair lost its soft auburn, falling limply in black stringy clumps.\n\nHer skin lost its pallor, gaining a hideous gray tinge, her veins etching black lines across her, rather than the typical blue.\n\nHer left leg flew up with rapidity and slammed the ground like a puppets. Her right followed. Her talons scraped my chin as I turned and ran.\n\n\u201cCome out come out, wherever you are!\u201d Mommy sing-songed, her breath pouring over my neck.\n\n\u201cPlease stop, mommy.\u201d I bawled. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d\n\nI reached the front door, but the deadbolt was at least a foot out of reach. I turned and ran upstairs.\n\nIt was fruitless at that point. I didn\u2019t know how to open a window. The weird handle-levers always strained my little hands. I cowered in my closet.\n\nA heavy thump sounded on the door, more followed.\n\nHer grin stretched from ear to ear before it widened into a snarl.",

            "comment": "\\[Royally Persistent\\]\n\n\"They're coming!\" Rachel got to her feet as the sound of rustling leaves came from the forest. She'd been enjoying a picnic near the trees when a friendly young knight in chain armor stopped by to chat. She introduced herself as Justice; but, it wasn't long before Rachel felt an uneasy tingle on the back of her neck. Something inside urged her to her feet.\r  \n\r  \nRachel took a few steps toward the road and risked looking back. A dozen beady eyes all focused on her. A group of sickly green, short goblins emerged from the trees snarling and grumbling orders at each other. There were too many; she knew both of them wouldn't escape that many. She made an instant decision as she pushed the young, pink-haired stranger ahead of her. \"Run dear, run fast. Don't be scared, I'll be right behind you.\"  \r  \n\r  \nJustice did not run. She wasn't scared. She sighed with distinct disappointment and made an upward flick with her wrist. Rachel ran two steps to catch up to the teen she pushed and stopped.\r  \n\r  \n\"WHY AREN'T YOU RUNNING!?\" she asked. Justice shrugged as she wiggled her fingers in the air as if she was touching some invisible surface. \r  \n\r  \n\"Not what I'm looking for,\" she said.\r  \n\r  \n\"WHAT!?\" Rachel shook her head with confusion. She reached forward to grab Justice's hand. But her own hand, along with the rest of her, disintegrated into white powder before she completed the motion.\r  \n\r  \nJustice waited a moment, then she walked closer to the edge of the forest.  A middle-aged woman sat on a blanket with a book and a small basket of food next to her. \r  \n\r  \n\"Hi, my names Justice,\" she smiled at the woman.\r  \n\r  \n\"Hello, Justice. I'm Rachel, it's such a lovely day outside. Would you like to join me? I have plenty of food to share,\" she gestured at the basket.\r  \n\r  \n\"This close to the forest?\" Justice asked. \"Are you sure it's safe?\" \r  \n\r  \n\"Well, I'm sure..,\" Rachel rose to her feet even as she answered the question. She realized she'd been somewhat reckless when she heard a faint rustling in the trees behind her. Fear drove her forward; but, she looked back. A pair of towering, fat, pinkish ogres shambled out of the forest with their gaze locked on her. \"They're coming!\"\r  \n \r  \n\"Run dear, run fast,\" she pushed Justice. \"Don't be scared, I'll be right behind you.\"  \r  \n\r  \n\"NOoooo!\" Justice whined. She seemed more annoyed than terrified; and, she didn't flee. She made a flicking motion with her wrist, then began wiggling her fingers in the air in front of her. \r  \n\r  \n\"RUN!\" Rachel yelled. \"WHY AREN'T -,\" her question was interrupted as her body disintegrated. Justice sighed and waited a moment while the ogress disappeared too. Then, she strode forward when Rachel reappeared on the blanket. \r  \n\r  \n \"Hi, my names Justice,\" she smiled at the woman. \r  \n\r  \n \"Hello, Justice. I'm Rachel, it's such a lovely day outside. Would you like to join me? I have plenty of food to share.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Is it safe this close to the forest?\" Justice asked.\r  \n\r  \n \"Well, I'm sure..,\" Rachel rose to her feet even as she answered the question. Justice focused on the forest and she heard rustling leaves and branches. Rachel turned and stared with wide eyes as a dozen red, dog-sized spiders crawled out of the forest.  \r  \n\r  \n \"They're coming!\" Rachel pushed Justice. \"Run dear, run fast. Don't be scared, I'll be right behind you.\"  \r  \n\r  \n\"Now we're talking!\" Justice grinned. Rachel had no idea where it came from; but, Justice was now holding an elegant purple and gold banner. She planted it in the ground and raised her hand up in the air. Another magical banner materialized in her hand; this one was white with a red #16 embroidered on it. She planted that one in the ground and drew her sword as she began to glow with a brilliant aura. \r  \n\r  \n\"Why aren't you running!??\" Rachel asked the question even as she positioned Justice between her and the spiders. If the girl was going to fight, she could be the one to run away. \r  \n\r  \n\"Are you kidding?\" Justice smiled at Rachel, then turned to face the spiders.  \"It took nine tries just to get the right monsters to spawn.\"\r  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\r  \nThank you for reading! I\u2019m responding to prompts every day. This is story #1973 in a row. (Story #163 in year six.). This story is part of an ongoing saga that takes place at a Corporation in my universe.",

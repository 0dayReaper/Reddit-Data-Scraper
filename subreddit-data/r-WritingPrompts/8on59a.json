            "comment": "As I sit here, scrolling through the unending feed, I can't help but wonder if what's going on around us is the same thing. Anti-aging this, prolonged life that. It seems like it's continuous.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I could never understand why reading and watching the news was so important. Now, as I approach my 86th year, I know why. It's been preparing us for the worst. It's been showing us what our world has become. Almost 60 years ago, that shit was released. I was envious at first but I recovered. I was just starting out at Microcon. Worked my way up pretty quickly. Retired with a nice, fat pension. They announced what happened to my revulsion.\n\nIt seems as though A.I. had surpassed all predictions and quietly rolled out an anti-aging serum called Reversol that would stop it all together. Only problem was, you had to be young in order to be young forever. Apparently, 28 was no longer considered young. Bullshit. Either way, I kept earning my paycheck, met my sweetheart and retired happy. That's when the rumors started. Turns out Reversol wasn't as great as they said. Rumors were that it started with migraines. Even if you'd never had one, once a week you'd have a blinding migraine. Coinciding with the serum treatments. After the migraine, motor functions would start being...funny. Finger twitches, leg spasms, random hard ons. All the while, your internals were working to eliminate you. You started feeling...controlled. Like the actions you take aren't exactly yours. \n\n20 years now, I've been hearing about how A.I. was going to rule us and it turns out, it does. With a phrase, our smart homes are controlled by a little speaker that answers our every command. A.I. developed Reversol to take us out. It put together a 60 year plan. If you were over 26, you would pose the least resistance when shit hit the fan. I can barely move now. They were right.\n\nNow, I write this in hopes that it'll reach someone who CAN do something. You see, I've been feeling...funny. But it comes it waves. One day I'm fine, the next is sketchy. Today is a good day. I always thought it would be some debilitating disease that got me. Now, I'm not so sure.\n\nGood luck, whoever you are.... ",

            "comment": "July 2022 note: I submitted this to the Tiny Tales podcast under the name Taylor Rae :)\n\n***\n\nThe immortals are crumbling like dry leaves.\n\nI watch one as I leave Marge's Cafe with my usual paper cup of coffee. There is a woman standing on the opposite street corner in a trench coat, her hair sleek black, her face as faultless as fine china.\n\nAnd all it takes is a harsh wind.\n\nShe falls away in tiny pieces. Her hands claw helplessly at her disintegrating belly with fingers whose flesh sloughes off in sheets like wet paper. She reaches for her face, but then that too clouds up into dust and is gone. Her scream starts and dies in her throat.\n\nAnd just like that, she smacks down like a broken puppet. A near-instant death, and still it doesn't seem fast enough.\n\nHer scream keeps echoing in the back of my mind. I think it will always be there, waiting for me, when the world grows quiet enough for me to hear her once more.\n\nLike any decent human would, I stick around for EMS. I call and call, but I can't get through to 911. Someone happening by stops over the body, kicking up clouds of this woman's dust. The woman looks to be my age, one of the lost, one of the few humans left doomed to die.\n\nShe sighs through her teeth. \"Bad luck, the lot of them.\"\n\nI stare at her. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Turns out us Lost will be last after all.\" She winks, like we share a kind of secret just by being born on the wrong side of the cut-off for immortality. As if there's any real camaraderie in our Lost Generation. \"The immortals are all just... vanishing. It's on the news, dearie.\"\n\nAnd then she keeps on walking, as though we were only chatting about the weather.\n\nIt's early still. The cool morning air is so placid and peaceful, her words impossible on a morning as bright and sunny as this. As if death could not happen under such a perfect blue sky.\n\nI run to the car. It has been a while, since I ran. Decades, at least. \n\nMy wife still runs. She's always teasing me, calls me an old man as she pecks a good morning kiss to my lips. Slaps my aching knees and says, \"That's your penance for being born too early.\"\n\nAnd I always laugh at her and say, \"Hey, I know I won't be the one dying alone.\" Half a joke, really. Always dancing around the inevitable and morbid reality: I would end, and she would keep on going. With any luck, it would be forever. We had both made our peace with that.\n\nThe radio is buzzing, mad. It's already all over the news. There's some scientist babbling about dew point, the relative wetness of the air. \n\n\"As the world gets hotter and hotter, and the air gets drier and drier, it appears that the cells lose their stability and their ability to maintain struc--\"\n\nI flip the radio off. And I drive like hell.\n\nPanic drives me forward like a thing possessed. I throw my coffee out the window and veer through still-empty streets back to my home, where my wife should still be lying in bed, just about to roll up and face the dawn. She will open the window and listen to the birds convince her to rise and make a cup of tea.\n\nIn my mind, she looks as lovely as the day we married. She makes the deep ruts of my skin seem like valleys, but she still palms my cheeks in her hands and tells me every day, *I love you, Mr. Weston,* and I smile back and say, *I don't know why, Mrs. Weston.*\n\nBut when I get there, the window is shut. The bed is as empty as the rest of the house. I call and call and scream for her, but the house answers back with nothing but silence.\n\nSo I go to the bed where this morning she lay curled like a question mark beside me. I had kissed her shoulder and slipped out as soundlessly as an eighty-year-old-man wearing every weight of his age could hope.\n\nI lift back the blanket.\n\nThere awaits me only bones and so much ash. I try to scoop her up in my palms but she is nothing but wind and air.\n\nAnd I am suddenly, impossibly alone.\n\n***\n\n/r/shoringupfragments",

Must be hard having everlasting life.\n\nProbably an update on that volcano rolling through Hawaii for the last sixty years. Heaven to hell in under a century.\n\nA chiron scrolled across the bottom, blaring \"EMERGENCY: VITA26 DEFECTS.\"\n\nWell, that was new. My finger pressed the unmute and I took a bite of my ham and cheese as Burris squeaky kid voice emitted from the vWall.\n\n\"\\-\\-drastic ramifications for the health of our society. We currently have no estimation on what it will take to rectify the situation as all genetic manipulations have become inert in V26 takers.\"\n\nMy jaw slowly hung open, a half ground piece of ham plopping out onto my plate. What was that? I wave my hand in front of the vWall, rewinding the message by a minute.\n\n\"Current studies produced by our Department of Health, the United Nations and the Chinese Ministry of People have all reached the same conclusion: V26 has a detrimental side effect. The side effect was not originally discovered since longitudinal surveys only encompassed 10 year periods. Initial signs manifest approximately fifty years with a rate of deterioration varying based on genetic composition.\" \n\nWhat the hell was he going on about? What critical side effect? \n\n\"We have tried a vast cross section of remedies with no solutions in sight. Clearly, this has drastic ramifications for the Department of Health. We currently have no estimation on what it will take to rectify the situation as all genetic manipulations have become inert in V26 takers.\"\n\nOk, I got that part, which was alarming in and of itself. Gene\\-therapy, ever since CRISPR has been the hallmark of modern civilization. I was old, but I wasn't dying. I had another thirty or forty left in me thanks to gene therapy.\n\n\"To repeat, people exhibiting the symptoms of V26 degradation are to be considered EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. If you see someone exhibiting these signs, you are to call the number appearing on your screen.\"\n\nBurris was reduced to a small picture\\-in\\-picture in the corner, with a large graphic appearing. On top there was a CDC number for those showing V26 Syndrome. Below, the symptoms were listed out.\n\n*Deterioration in higher mental reasoning.*\n\n*Deterioration in physical coordination.*\n\n*Extreme violence.*\n\n*Cannibalism.*\n\nFucking cannibalism? This shit got real in a hurry. Wait a second. My eyes scanned down through the list of symptoms again. This was all sounding a bit too familiar, like those old scary movies from my youth.\n\nZombies. They were all turning in to zombies.\n\nShit. The old guy never lives in zombie movies.\n\n**Platypus out.**\n\n**Want more peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus",

            "comment": "They told us we wouldn\u2019t get Alzheimers.\n\nTechnically, they were right.\n\nThe ads plastered on every billboard, livestream, and website promised Ephoebus would preserve our body and brain\u2019s critical functions.  The generation young enough to take it would have the quick wits of a twenty-something combined with the wisdom of an elder.  Who could refuse that?\n\nEmily didn\u2019t.\n\nNo matter how much we argued, no matter how many times I brought up the risks, the lack of long-term trials on the drug.  That she\u2019d be mortally dependent on it for the rest of her life.  She compared me to technophobic conspiracy theorists, or the religious fundamentalists who glorified the prospect of death.\n\nApparently, I was jealous, controlling, afraid of death.  That I wanted to be young enough to be chosen.\n\nMaybe she was right.  Maybe I resented the prospect of being left behind by the whole world, of fading into obscurity and nonexistence.  But after a few months of her taking it, it didn\u2019t matter anymore.  She was hooked for life, and I had to watch myself grow old while my wife stayed as young and flawless as the day we met.  My skin wrinkled, my hair started coming out, and my wife stopped looking at me the same way, no matter how many times we professed our eternal love.\n\nDivorce was messy, painful, full of scary questions and scarier answers.  So we just lived together in apathy, and let our romance decay piece by piece just as my body did.\n\nWe saw it for the first time on the news, after catching the occasional rumor from conspiracy forums and message boards.\n\nHou Fen, a Taiwanese immigrant and the first person to take Ephoebus, was found by the police in his house two weeks after his hundredth birthday.  The bodies of his husband and daughter were in the basement, dissected and hung on meat hooks in his living room.\n\nIn recordings of police interrogations, he looked mildly bemused and nonchalant about his slaughter, stating that he was simply curious to see what their insides looked like.\n\nHe was the first Ephoebus user to make international headlines.  But not the last.\n\nIt took teams of neuroscientists and psychologists a few weeks to determine the cause.  The drug preserved reasoning, creativity, and memory perfectly.  But not emotional range.  At a certain point around people\u2019s hundredth birthday, their minds snapped, and all empathy, love, and moral compass rotted away in a matter of weeks.\n\nPure sociopaths, cropping up by the millions around the globe.\n\nMass shootings and homicides became a near-daily occurrence on the evening news.  Not just from the elderly who lost their humanity, unable to stop taking the drug without dying, but among the young as well, terrified that their aging relatives would butcher them in their sleep.\n\nIt took less than a month for the president to declare martial law, and mandate immediate registration for every citizen over the age of 98.\n\nThe sound of shouting and our front door being kicked down stirred me from my sleep.  Already awake, Emily helped pull me to my feet and handed me my walking stick.  We walked into our living room to the sight of a police officer training a taser on us.\n\n\u201cMrs. Emily Wilson.  You are to be detained by order of executive order nine-one-four-five-one, under suspicion of Ephoebus Decay!\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me, what the fuck?\u201d  I stepped in between him and Emily, raising a hand.  \u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d\n\nThe officer stepped around me, training his weapon on Emily.   \u201cNew emergency order.  Zero-risk policy.  Your wife turns one hundred in a month, which means she\u2019s got a few weeks at best before becoming one of them.  If she isn\u2019t already.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what next?  You put us in a camp?\u201d  Emily clenched her teeth.  \u201cFuck you.  Constitutional rights.  You want to arrest me, charge me, asshole.\u201d\n\nHe pulled the trigger, shooting the fins from his taser into her chest.\n\nEmily fell to the ground, twitching.  He started kicking her, driving the heel of his boot into her chest again and again.  She cried out in pain, whimpering, tears streaming down her cheeks.\n\nIt only seemed to heighten his rage.  \u201cManipulative fuck.  You socios can fake any emotion you want.  Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d  He kept kicking her, ignoring her screams and my shouting.\n\n\u201cStop, stop it!  We\u2019ll come quietly!  Stop!\u201d  The tension in my shoulders reached a breaking point.  I heard a rushing in my ears, felt my body move almost unconsciously, and a thud of impact on my hand.\n\nI blinked.  A kitchen knife was in my hand, plunged into the side of his neck.  The officer turned to look at me, almost stunned that an old man was capable of such a feat.  Then the blood poured from the wound and he dropped to the floor, gurgling.\n\nI pulled the taser fins out of Emily, and cradled her as she sobbed into my arms.  We sat together on the floor, frozen in shock, unable to process what had just transpired for I don\u2019t know how long.  As my breathing steadied, and I felt my heart rate slow, I gazed around the room, staring at the body of the dead cop on our living room floor, surrounded by a pool of blood.\n\nI pushed myself upright, ignoring the stabs of pain from my back.  \u201cCome on, Emily.  Get up.\u201d  I offered my hand, helping her pull herself upright, and inhaled.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even possible.  But we\u2019re going to find a cure. \n Whatever it takes, I'm going to keep you from breaking.\u201d\n\nI grasped her hands, kissing her on the cheek.  \u201cGrab what you can carry.\u201d\n\nWe left the house in our car, driving for the border, fleeing the sound of sirens.",

            "comment": "Every year, I felt a little bit older than I should on my birthday. And each year, I shuffled into the Lost Generation clinic to see baby\\-faced Dr. Sherwood to report the sensation.\n\n\u201cAh Mr. Murray! The same thing every year! We\u2019ve been talking about this for the last 10 years!\u201d Dr. Sherwood laughed.\n\n\u201cAnd every year you look the same, but I get older,\u201d I grumbled.\n\n\u201cYou know I can\u2019t go back in time and give you Renuxia. It just wasn\u2019t safe for people over 26. Something about the telomeres at 26 caused the body to go into a hyperinflammatory, hyperaging state that caused rapidly fatal heart attacks,\u201d Dr. Sherwood gazed off into the distance.\n\n\u201cRead that in the history books, did you?\u201d I sneered.\n\n\u201cNow Mr. Murray, I may not have been around when they first started giving Renuxia, but I have been in practice for 20 years now. And I can assure you that the symptoms you are describing are completely consistent with the normal aging process. You have all of your faculties about you. Your memory is sharp as a tack!\u201d\n\nDr. Sherwood paused, but I did not have anything to say.\n\n\u201cBecoming more fatigued and feeling like time is passing more slowly is consistent with the normal aging process. If it is interfering with your daily activities though, it could be an early sign of depression. I know your wife recently passed\u2026\u201d Dr. Sherwood gave a therapeutic pause.\n\n\u201cI miss her, but that\u2019s normal after you\u2019ve been with someone for over fifty years. I don\u2019t feel depressed though. Promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, well if you ever need anything for depression or just want to talk, you have my number,\u201d Dr. Sherwood seemed satisfied with his extension of availability.\n\n\u201cI just cannot shake the feeling that the years are going by more slowly. Isn\u2019t there some way to test that?\u201d\n\nDr. Sherwood gave a bemused smile. \u201cMr. Murray, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s quite out of my discipline. Perhaps you could phone a physicist? Anyway, it\u2019s good to see you sir. Have Doris get your bloodwork before you go. See you back in 6 months!\u201d\n\n\u2018Maybe I will,\u2019 I thought as I walked out of the office. My brother\\-in\\-law was still kicking and had been an aerospace engineer in an earlier life. Maybe he would know how to test my theory.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\n\u201cHey Chuck, how you been?\u201d I had not talked to him since the funeral.\n\n\u201cNot bad Rick. How you holding up?\" Chuck answered over the video feed.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t complain. Getting old as you can see,\u201d I grinned half\\-heartedly.\n\n\u201cLook Chuck, I know we haven\u2019t spoken in a while, but I just have to ask you a physics question. It\u2019s been bugging me.\u201d\n\nChuck was used to my dumb questions though he sometimes got tired of them I think.\n\n\u201cHow could we tell if time was slowing down?\u201d I asked, expecting a glare or an eye roll.\n\nChuck\u2019s face tightened and he leaned forward into the video feed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call you from a secure feed,\u201d he said seriously.\n\nThe feed went blank.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\n\u201cPardon my language Chuck, but just what the hell is going on?\u201d I thought, realizing that Dr. Sherwood was probably wrong after all.\n\n\u201cYou feel it too?\u201d Chuck asked with cautious excitement.\n\n\u201cOf course I feel it. Every year it gets worse. This year it felt like my birthday took almost two years to get here.\u201d I was underestimating a bit. The eighty\\-four to eighty\\-five transition felt like my entire childhood.\n\nAs if reading my thoughts, Chuck said, \u201cThat\u2019s it? I would have said five years at least.\u201d\n\nChuck\u2019s eyes shifted nervously back and forth.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ve been trying to figure this out for a few years now. I thought I was crazy. I asked a bunch of people who took Renuxia and they don\u2019t seem to feel it. But all the Lost Generation folks who are willing to answer the question \u2013 all of them agree that they\u2019ve felt it.\u201d\n\nI stared blankly at the monitor.\n\n\u201cSo I got an old NASA buddy to help check the atomic clocks. All of them are in sync. If you just look on Earth, time appears to be flowing normally.\u201d\n\nJust on Earth? My eyes widened.\n\n\u201cBut if we compare satellite feeds to earth clocks, there is a clear time distortion as the satellite gets older. Voyager I says we\u2019re almost 60 years behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about how long it\u2019s been since Renuxia was released,\u201d I discovered aloud.\n\n\u201cExactly. I just don\u2019t know who to talk to. I\u2019m afraid that if I talk to the parent company of Renuxia, they\u2019ll squash the information and maybe me along with it. And if I bring it to Capitol Hill, well, they\u2019re the ones that mandated Renuxia in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d I asked incredulously.\n\n\u201cJust give me a bit more time. There are some really interesting discoveries in the field of quantum theory that could explain this and maybe even figure out a way to reverse it.\u201d\n\nI hung up the phone without a goodbye. Secure feeds only stay secure for so long.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nAfter a restless sleep, I awoke to Margo barking.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong girl? You never bark!\u201d\n\nMargo began to whimper and paw at the front door. Must have to pee.\n\nI opened the front door and Margo sprinted out the front gate.\n\n\u201cDamnit! Margo! Come back here!\u201d\n\nBefore I realized it, I was out in the middle of the street, looking across a chaotic scene. Cars piled up, apparently abandoned after the accidents. Oddly \u2013 only a few of the wrecks had bodies in them. A few mangled Lost Generation corpses. But no Ageless Generation bodies as far as the eye could see. Had they all just gotten up and walked away? I didn\u2019t remember Renuxia causing fast healing as a side effect.\n\nMargo had stopped at one of the car wrecks and was whining. Inside was Chuck, apparently unconscious, but alive.\n\nI ran up to the car. The accident seemed fairly minor, but an old\\-timer like Chuck could have bled into his brain even from a minor trauma.\n\n\u201cChuck! Chuck! Wake up!\u201d I yelled.\n\nChuck\u2019s eyes flitted and he turned his head.\n\n\u201cI had to tell you in person Rick. Looks like I chose the wrong time to be on the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe figured it out. The Renuxia was creating a temporal dissociation. Everyone who took it was able to move through time without being affected by it. For the rest of us, time around us and within us proceeded as normal. The discrepancy created a temporal dissociation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what happened to everyone who took it?! They all just vanished?\u201d I took another survey of the wrecked cars.\n\n\u201cTemporal correction. I knew it was coming, but I didn\u2019t know it would happen this soon. It has only ever been theoretical in the past. Never had anything to produce it before.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell we\u2019re right fucked then aren\u2019t we? Humanity is over! All the young folks are dead!\u201d My heart was racing.\n\n\u201cRenuxia was later found to be most effective when given as a series. And that doesn\u2019t start until age 5\u2026\u201d Chuck trailed off.\n\n\u201cBetter start rounding up the kids.\u201d I turned and walked toward the neighbor\u2019s house where I could now hear a wan cry that had been drowned out previously by Margo\u2019s barking.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nEdit: I'm so glad that so many people enjoyed this!

Only the Lost Generation and children under 5 were left in the planet. (again, that's just my interpretation, so.) ",

            "comment": "I leaned forward in my recliner, imploring the volume to rise from the TK implant. It wasn't real telekinesis but marketing teams thought it was cool to call it that. The retirement home seemed quieter than normal.\n\nEveryone was tuning in.\n\nThe news cycle for the past few weeks had grown worse. People going missing then. Mass disappearances. Wild fires raging globally. Strings of arsons. Several space stations had even had catastrophes. Even on Mars there were occurrences.\n\nAnd no one taking credit.\n\nAs the reason was revealed, I was glad that I never had kids.\n\nThe Immortals, essentially every one to be born since the anti-aging drug's release, were a literal ticking time bomb.\n\nIt artificially restored telomeres through chemical means but it seemed to eventually fail in a catastrophic chain reaction.\n\nPeople gooified. Then the goo reduced to base elements of oxygen and hydrogen, then the spark of phosphorus hitting air. Spontaneous combustion.\n\nThe failure rate was 100%. There was no way to prevent it once the body reached a tolerance to the drug.\n\nIt was even transgenerational.\n\nPeople were frantic to call family. I dreaded reaching out to a friend as the news started to go to talking heads who's youthful faces perspired fear.\n\nThe poor bastards. I let a slow breath, trying to not get worked up. \n\nIt was bad enough to have family die to it. Seeing young and vital people die after getting so advanced years resonated in me. My bitterness and regret at being aged out had long dried up. It was wrenching to hear the sobs from the nurse's station from the Immortals that took care of us. Poor Gina, she was nice. My lips drew tight as emotions began to well in me.\n\nThere were so few not on the drug, few brave enough to age and face oblivion. But the majority of them were the fundimentalist Christians who thought it was wrong to \"play God.\" There were a few in the home. They were self-righteous and ignorant. Often a case of sour grapes more than a devotion of faith.\n\nWhen the calmly smiling, pastor-slash-pundit appeared in my Holo-Screen and declared it \"Rapture.\" I knew his face all too well. I had interned with the pharmaceutical company that made the drug during my biochemistry degree all those years ago. Funny how an R&amp;D head could be born again. He was a self proclaimed Malthusian, which translates readily to immoral capitalist often enough. He had the CEOs ear because they were in the same fraternity.\n\nI had disliked his sliminess then but I suddenly loathed him and his Evangelical helmet hair.\n\nMy chest began to seize with an extreme pressure coinciding with a terrible revelation. The nurses where too deep in sudden existential dread to care about my alerts pinging their implants. I tried to calm myself. Desperately and in vain. But I was old and my body couldn't take the burning implication in my brain.\n\nThe bastards had given a faulty drug but they had a plan. Now that people would live long enough to care that the Earth was fucked. Sweeping legalisation had pulled us from the brink of extinction. People had an infinite future so the made damn sure there was a lot of it.\n\nThe only issue was population. With no one dying it would grow exponentially.\n\nThey had solved that alongside global warming.\n\nI prespired, I gasped. My chest felt like a collapsing star of pressure and straining pain. I was just too furious to control myself.\n\nThe pastor spoke as my vision and body grew distant as I was sucked down the tunnel to oblivion.\n\nBut I still saw him so clearly. His eyes delighted, his lips curved so smugly, \"... And the righteous will live on in His Name through this time of Trial and Tribulation.\"",

            "comment": "The gunsmoke lingers lazily about a foot in front of me, sharp smell of sulfurous anger assaults my nostrils, foreign yet familiar. The smoke gently obscures the writhing psychopath on my floor, bleeding out all over my goddamn berber carpet that I just had cleaned not even a week ago. As the blood soaks in a widening pool around this weirdo, I muse that perhaps I should lay down a darker color sometime soon. His gurgles and wet shrieks snap me back, and I retrain my pistol on him, just in case he gets a second wind and decides to get squirrely again. Can't ever really tell with these gene\\-freaks, ever since that drug hit the market some 60 someodd years ago and everyone was sold the promise they could live forever, shit just kinda has been going downhill. I was too old when they started handing out that drug, whatever it was called. PermaLife? VitaLife? I can't fucking remember these days. I was too old, but I had a funny feeling about it. A man shouldn't trust strangers in fancy suits when they talked about money, souls or beauty, and this certainly qualified. Everybody wanted to stay pretty, got to stay pretty, right down to the genetic level. Problem was it was too good to be true\\- these kids apparently never heard of Microsoft Windows. Always wait a while before buying a brand new product\\- it's always rushed and there are always problems they didn't account for. Except this time this product gave your whole brain a blue screen of death. Polymyelinating Colloidal Hyperagitation, the people with pay grades bigger than mine called it. Rest of us just called it the Giggles. Turns out, even though you can keep the body looking young, the mind's a different matter. Damn thing can only process so much information, it has to evolve in order to keep your sanity. That's why you start forgetting shit when you're older than dirt like me. Problem is the new drug stopped the brain from being able to do that. So it just kept getting overstimulated like someone threw a Chevy in neutral and kept pressing the pedal. Some folks, younger ones, handle it a little better, but get up to my age chronologically and everything starts to go catty whompers eventually. Nerves and neurons fuse and flare, too much electroconductivity happens in the brain, too much hyperperfusion, throws 'em into a state of superacute psychosis\\- at least that's what it says in the fine print. The brainiac's are still throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks, but they at least got the warning out about, oh 10 minutes before everything took a massive shit all over the place. \n\nSpeaking of shit, the smell of voided bowels cuts through the smoke and let's me know that pissboy here isn't going to be getting back up. I poke him in the balls with the end of my cane, for good measure. Anyone can shit themselves, but no matter how psycho you are, you react when someone jabs a metal rod in your balls. I stick 'em a few times, and nothing in his rictus\\-grin face shows me he's still on this earth. I punch a few buttons on my recessed wall communicator and wait until the swirling 'standby' notice disappears. \n\n\"Got another one, eh, Bill?\" my neighbor Rich damn near scares the shit out of me as he appears in my doorway suddenly\n\n\"Christ almighty, Richie, you almost got your ticket punched too, ya asshole.\" I realize I'm pointing my pistol at his chest, and lower it, feeling the jolt of adrenalin course through me. I ride the hammer home and tuck the piece in my holster in my waistband. \n\nRichie shrugged. \"You'd be doing me a favor. Get me off this train wreck before it gets really bad.\" he shuffles to the doorway, holding on to the doorjamb for balance. Richie could probably use a cane or a walker of some sort, but he's either too proud or too stupid to get one. \"What's this, number four now?\"\n\n\"Something like that. You want a coffee, Richie? I was about to put a pot on.\" I say, waving him in. The wall caller still tells me to standby. \n\n\"Maybe. Was thinking about taking a walk down to McCarveys. Maybe pick Annette up on the way, wanna tag along?\" \n\n\"I dunno, Richie. Is McCarveys even still standing? Either way, I don't feel like blasting my way through a dozen more of these loonies just for some watered\\-down bourbon.\" The swirling standby message has stopped, then disappeared, and a new message prompting me to select what service I need comes up. I hit medical, police and sanitary, then hit send. The standby message reappears. \n\n\"It's strange.\" Richie says suddenly.\n\n\"What's that, now?\"\n\n\"I says, it's strange. I'm looking at this freako, here, and in my mind I'm thinkin', 'what a waste of a life.' Then somewhere some other part reminds me this thing is about as old as we are, just about. It's just a weird thing to rectify, mentally. Ya know?\" Richie says, tapping the head of the dead guy with his shoe. \n\n\"Yeah. I just think it's funny that this shithead wanted to live forever and ended up dying before I did.\" I chuckled, and Richie smiles and shakes his head. Irony's a bitch. \n\nThe wall caller chirps and an automated voice asks me what the nature of my emergency is. \n\n\"Well, it;'s not an emergency per se, but there is a dead guy on my floor, so I figured someone should be alerted.\" I say. You know your old when you hate people but still consider the 'good ol days' to be when someone with a pulse answered an emergency call. \n\n\"You stated; someone has died. Is this correct?\" the wall caller asks.\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Can you identify the cause of death?\" the wall caller asks. I think for a moment. \n\n\"Acute traumatic exsanguination.\" I reply. Richie snorts a chuckle. The line goes silent for a few seconds. \n\n\"Do you have reason to believe that the deceased is an individual who may have taken MetaLife brand chemical supplements?\" the wall caller asks, except this time the tinny voice has changed into someone a bit more authoritative. I hesitate, knowing where this is heading. \n\n\"It's certainly not outside the realm of possibility.\" I respond. I swear I can hear the wall caller click in frustration. \n\n\"A representative from Foundation Pharmaceuticals is being dispatched along with police, medical and fire to your location. Please do not touch or alter the deceased. If you have animals or pets, please secure them away from the deceased. Do not ingest bodily fluids from the deceased. Do not...\"\n\nI sigh, knowing what's going to come next. The suits will show up, grill me for the next three hours over what happened, scold me for not taking the subject alive or alerting them while he was still alive, then they'll look at my record and start accusing me of all kinds of things like manslaughter or freak hunting, all while denying that there's any connection between their product and the near billion and growing number of people around the globe showing similar effects, there will be gag orders, I'll have to lawyer up...\n\n\"...in the deceased's mouth, nostrils, or any other oriface. Do you have any questions or comments before we terminate this call?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" I say, grabbing an extra loaded magazine from my kitchen drawer, \"I'll be down at McCarvey's on 4th street if you need me.\"",

            "comment": "All I want to do is die.\n\nYou see, I know all about death, as I have killed myself in every way you can possibly imagine over the last 3,490 years. You heard me correctly...nearly 35 centuries have passed since Every time I do it, every cell of my body reassembles and I wake up...again.\n\nI\u2019m a bit of an oddball. You see, I was 28 years old when I was recruited by the Northern California Chronorium Distribution team. I know what you\u2019re thinking. Yes, I broke the law; I let everyone down. I\u2019ve suffered the consequences more times than I can count. \n\nYou can help me to make everything right. But first, let me explain what I did all of those centuries ago and why you are reading this now.\n\nOne day, my mother, Mary, was driving to work and she witnessed the aftermath of a horrible accident. Two cars had collided at high speed. One car had stopped burning, and the other was resting on its roof on the side of the embankment. The forest in this park of Oregon was thick, and both vehicles were hard to see from the road. Mom was an RN at the local hospital on her way in for the night shift. \n\nShe got out of the car and ran to the first car as fast as she could. The driver of that car was an elderly man who had massive lacerations and had likely died on impact. It was beginning to get dark, so she could barely make out the passenger: a young doe that had probably caused the accident.\n\nMy mother then heard something that would literally change the course of history: a small child crying out in the night.\n\nMary investigated the other car and immediately recognized the passengers as Marty and Marlene Zerkin. The Zerkins were career criminals that used to live next door. Marty had been arrested on suspicion of murder and had spent 5 years in prison for armed robbery. Marlene had also done time for elder abuse. After a young girl disappeared in town, so did the Zerkins, whom had met their fate this evening. Mary new immediately that the voice she heard was likely their son, Marty Jr....me. \n\nI was two years old at the time. I don\u2019t remember any of this, only what mom told me when I was 16: she had decide to raise me alone. She had an opportunity to divert the death report of a young man two years later while working an ER shift. She changed her name to match my new identity and moved to Phoenix. \n\nNot only did I learn about all of this on my 16th birthday, I also learned that I was 18, not 16. I had always been a scrawny little guy. Marlene had nearly starved me to death and my growth had stunted. So much of it made sense: why I had always felt so different and why other kids seemed immature and stupid at times. \n\nTo her credit, mom was ready to come clean. She would have admitted her fraud knowing that her little boy had grown into a young man. She gave me the option to tell the truth. I chose to get my GED, drop out of high school and eventually go to med school. I protected mom and perpetuated the lie.\n\nSo when it came time to give patents the serum, I was offered a chance to be injected by a colleague. A good friend of mine worked at the FDA, and she told me that the age restriction data was fabricated, and that it was all an elaborate scheme to give the government time to figure out how to control the population. As you may have guessed, she lied.\n\nNot only does the drug have unusual side effects for those over 26 at time of injection, it had a very unique effect on me. A rare genetic mutation  combined with the drug to create an immune system and chronetic anomaly that made me immortal at 28. The LessThans died of \u201cnatural causes\u201d at the ripe old age of 230. Some did make it to 250, and today colonists at Alpha Centauri live to 240 or more, on average. \n\nI, on the other hand, have the curse of immortality. I was a fool. I have met four others like me. We all stay far away from each other because of the myths that follow ya from century to century. \n\nI currently live on Io, one of Jupiters\u2019 moons, in the year 5508. I am part of a research team that has made a breakthrough in time travel. I have been secretly working in this area for over 500 years, changing my appearance through black market nanosurgery. Anyway, my goal is simple: to alter my timeline so that I was never born.\n\nI\u2019ve tried going back in time to murder Marlene and Marty before I was conceived. I\u2019ve even got back and murdered their ancestors. Nothing works. Oh, I\u2019ve changed  your history. You would be amazed how much. It hasn\u2019t always been for the better but I\u2019ve tried, I really have. But playing God is wrong. I\u2019ve gone mad more times than I remember. \n\nThis is where you come in, dear reader. You see, I can alter the timeline of everyone but myself. It\u2019s a discovery I will make nearly 32 centuries into your future. You have the power to stop my misery and keep your own timeline the same. In exchange I will provide you with a time travel device and the latest life extension technology available in my time. You must be 26 or under, that much has not changed.\n\nYou are reading this right now because I have made a device that allows me to connect to one of your ancient computing devices in a remote part of Earth known as Greenland...Ironically not very green? Anyway, converting my speech to your ancient language has been a chore...so crude! I digress. \n\nThe Remote Temporal Transmission device allows me to communicate with you. I am under immense scrutiny by the Martian Science Authority. I have to delay my communications with 2018 Earth by exactly one year. Next June 25th, Marty and Marlene will meet at a bar in downtown Portland, Oregon. All you have to do is prevent this. You have one year to prepare. On June 5th, 2019 I will send a second transmission with the exact time and location of their meeting. \n\nI\u2019m counting on you. Please help me find peace.\n",

They loved each other even more passionately than they despised the rules the government had put in place, because meeting someone his age, at this time, and still falling in love knowing you'll lose them; well, that's real love. \n\nFor a while, they both accepted it. She knew that if she lost him then she'd kill herself, and she'd prefer to do that later rather than sooner. So, they married, and joined the last generation of lovers who'd be separated by death. \n\nBut, the years flew by for her, and she only noticed them in him. The promise of death constantly nagged at her mind, but the chance of an eternal life with him gave her endless hope for the future. She set a plan in motion, and worked to save their lives. \n\nFifteen years later, she earned a position working in a building that administered the death cure. Not working directly with the cure; The government didn't trust those who still had close ties to the lost generation, even after they'd divorced to increase her chances. He had hated going through with the divorce, but she didn't care. Laws and norms meant nothing to her now, all that mattered was the endless love she chased. \n\nWith amazing difficulty, she stole a dose of the cure and saved them both. She was sure to be wanted by the authorities by now, and his appearance was well-aged and would eventually become a dead giveaway, so they left their society behind them and started a new life. \n\nThey found peace in the wilderness, and started their endless life together. Every day they loved one another, and, somehow, their love managed to grow even stronger each day. Their life was passionate bliss, and they knew it'd last forever. \n\nThen, one day, she couldn't get out of bed. She hadn't been sick in decades, and he looked back to society for an answer. They hadn't used the old radio for years, and when it crackled to life, it brought death.  \n\nAll around the world, people were experiencing the cure's only side effect. She'd soon start to lose her mind, and eventually her life. \n\n\"Kill me..\" she'd said after hearing the news, but he couldn't. He knew he was being weak, but he could never bring himself to do it. \n\n\"I'll stay with you until you're gone, just like you would have.\" \n\nHe stayed at her bedside at all hours, barely sleeping or eating; and she laid there, loving him as passionately as ever, slowly going mad, and as did she, so did he.  \n \n/r/BeagleTales \n",

In fact, until the introduction of the \u2206S314 therapy, the debate about the exact process of aging seemed to be one of the few things that is immortal. \u2206S314 didn't really provide a conclusion for the debate \\- it just provided the tired and jaded academics an excuse to sweep the arguments under the rug.   \n\nFor The Eternal Generation, aging is a term that had lost its relevance. \"  \n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- \n\nSan Francisco \\- 2089 \n\n\"Perhaps \u2206S314 not only stops physical aging, but also slows aging psychologically,\" I thought to my self as I sighed quietly. Danny, an academic rich in his fervor and completely oblivious of the atmosphere, rambled about genes and computers for the 162th time since the dissolution of UC Berkeley.   \n\n\"You see Lang, aging is a lot like that rusty calculator box of yours,\" said Danny as he knocked on the PC I had built seven years ago.  \n\n\"That calculator box you are knocking are made from old parts I auctioned off from Lawrence Hall of Science. You might want to be more gentle with it old pal,\" I complained as I called my household android over to wipe the glass panel of my PC.  \n\n\"Sorry bud. Didn't think you still have such a penchant for old stuff. Anyway, back to what I am discussing. Computers sometimes have their files corrupted right? And when that happens, errors start to accumulate and one day, BOOM, your computer have some system files corrupted and run into a fatal error. Now how do you prevent such corruptions from happening?\"  \n\n\"You don't. You put corruption into your consideration and back up your files. Some enterprise folks even used something called an ECC memory back in the days that actively fixes erroneous bits in operation,\" I replied.  \n\n\"And that is the new proposed theory for the mechanics of \u2206S314! Human aging, in essence, is the same corruption of information in the DNA. \u2206S314 backs up the information in your healthy, pre\\-26 DNA and actively restore your DNA to its original state if it sensed any changes!\" exclaimed Danny.  \n\n\"At least that explains why all the children look nearly the same nowadays. Probably because the magic molecule from their parents did a 'system restore' right?\" I asked sarcastically.  \n\nAnd for the 162th time since the dissolution of the university, Danny replied while sipping his tea: \"You actually bought into that crap from those Lost Generation protestors? No, the pill does not periodically reset your memory or cause your children to be clones of their parents. And no, the government didn't give out the pills to create a country of string puppets.\"  \n\n\"What happened to those protestors anyway? I haven't seen them on the news lately. Did they pass away?\" I asked Danny.   \n\n\"Oh I nearly forgot,\" said Danny as he waved the holographic notebook into existence, \"Those L Genners got what they wanted. They were jealous at E Genners' immortality, but now they can be immortal too. We just had a breakthrough in the mind upload research and the government pushed out an initiative to upload all L Genners' conscious into the new prototype androids just like your Isla there,\" Danny said as he pointed to the silver haired android wiping my old PC.  \n\n\"Wait, so they all agreed?\" I asked, an uneasy feeling rising in my throat.  \n\n\"Well, you see, when L Genners like you get old, they sometimes suffer lapses of memory, remembering things that never existed or seeing hallucinations. This can be a social concern, so the government made it compulsory to upload your body to a safer and more manageable vessel. And this this is why I am here today. I brought the Acknowledgement Form here as well. Come on, sign it quickly. The volunteers are waiting for you outside.\"  \n\nI looked outside the window. There is a black sedan in front of my house, and two burly men wearing black suits stepped out.  \n\nThis is the last sight I saw as Lang. ",

            "comment": "It wasn't that we suddenly realized all at once.  Bunch of us older folks noticed something was... off about them.  We tried to say something, but each time we were doubted.  And honestly, we couldn't help but doubt ourselves: our wisdom and ability to self reflect blinded us. Because of this, it took a lot longer than was probably reasonable or necessary before our suspicions were confirmed.  I'm not going to say that old cliche line \"by then, it was too late.\", because it wasn't.  The cure was simple: stop taking the drug.  Many went into denial either because they were already too far gone in their insanity or too scared to take the leap.  I couldn't blame them.  Those that got off the drugs aged dramatically.  In a week, they caught back up to speed.  Many of those that made the healthy decision couldn't handle the shock of getting old.  Most of them went into depression and no amount of reassurance and advice could alleviate the pain.  I could imagine what it was like to be old, but I had decades of resignation to prepare me. I slowly learned to make the best of it, but they thought they were free.  \n\n\nTruly free.\n\n\nSo many of them that had the courage to quit the drug either drugged themselves numb on something else or quit all together.  Not many of the \"Free Generation\" remains, and it's mostly those who had only started on the drug very recently.  They are too young to fend for themselves.  So alot of us older folks that are still around have been talking: We had to try the drug ourselves.  There are too many to care for and so few of us left.  Senior healthcare funding and research dried up after the drug, but our medicine outside of fighting old age was beyond imaginable.  We knew the side effects would kick in much, much earlier for us. But, we just needed a few more years.  Without it, there just wasn't enough time.  \n\n\n--PART 2--\n\n\nWith no alternative, we agreed on a plan.  Those useless otherwise would use the drug immediately; this meant the bedridden, dying, and/or utterly senile.  We didn't ask for consent, but most of them wanted the drug their whole lives anyways.  I knew I did.  But, there were those who still bitterly hated the drug and refused it.  They remembered the tears they wept as they hopelessly begged the pharmaceutical committee to reconsider.  They told me stories of how even their children saw them differently and were ashamed of them.  They wept through the agony of still loving them in spite of this; they were just happy that their children at least wouldn't have to fear death anymore.  One even admitted to wanting to die quickly so that their children would stop being picked on.  \n\n\"As long as I am their parent, they could never be free.\"\n\n\"It'd be better if the children forgot about us altogether.\"\n\nBut reality and fate were much crueler, their children though ungrateful died before them anyways.  Despite all that they went through, the drug was nothing more than a poison that took what they held most dear away from them.  They rightly demanded an explanation as to why they should trust us.  Some accused us of delusion, callousness, and fraud.  Rarely could I find any surviving grandchildren, so I brought along the orphans of strangers and plead the best I could.  Though they had every reason to refuse, by some miracle not one refused.  Many covered their eyes and wept as we administered the injection; slowly their wrinkles smoothed out and old aches and scars disappeared.\n\nFor the rest of us, we tried to delay the injection for as long as humanely possible.  With the fate of the world resting on our shoulders, we suddenly received a new lease on life.  It seemed some  notion of 'we can't die now' reach our bodies as many of us noticed less aches and pains.  \n\nWe were still careful.  We slept in pairs and strung 24/7 vitals monitors.  The moment any of us flatlined, our partners would administer the injection right away and begin resuscitation. The drug usually alleviated the cause of death, but only bought us a set finite amount of time: we would age backwards until we died.  We called it B. Button Syndrome after the famous short story.  If there was a cure, we would definitely not receive it in time.  We joked that it wasn't the first time we would miss out and we didn't want to find out what the side effects for \"the cure\" were going to be anyways.  ",

Mankind\u2019s hubris is always so painfully evident in hindsight. Immortality. Since the dawn of mankind something has chased us, but Provo-cal tripped it over. Always just around the corner, but Provo-cal held up a mirror. These were a few of their slogans. Alas, no matter how far or fast you run, it always gets up, and it always catches you. Heed my words: It ALWAYS catches you. \n\nI will concede that it was a blissful fifty-two years. With the fear of natural death and aging extinguished, scientific endeavours turned to new, thought provoking avenues. Cosmetic products practically fell off the market, and many young people don\u2019t even understand the concept of wearing makeup. \u201cWhy would you want to look younger?\u201d I had my grandson ask me one day. And now he\u2019s outside my house. Watching. Waiting. \nAt first, we called them Zombies. Those of us unaffected were old enough to remember the films of George Romero, so this name was used internationally. But it was entirely unsuitable. \u2018Zombies\u2019 are slow moving, mindless, brain eating drones. The Ferals contradicted every aspect of that description. Losing any ability to speak, the only thing they hunger for is the kill. They don\u2019t even eat their prey (in fact, we believe they don\u2019t even use food to sustain themselves), they just play with it. \nIt\u2019s poetic in its own sort of way. Those who cheated death for so long are now its harbingers. Maybe in another time we would have been able to control this. Had it occurred twenty-five years ago it would have been possible to intervene, forty years ago probable to stop, and fifty years ago it wouldn\u2019t have even been a problem. But we Survivors are old. We\u2019re weary. And in such few numbers, and those of us with the will to live have no means to fight off Ferals who are at their peak physical form. Even with weapons, we\u2019re aware of our slowed reactions and movements. And so are they. \nThis \u201cdossier\u201d may be unfortunately read as more of a short story. Story because, even as I write, I\u2019m aware of how absurd it would have sounded even five years ago, and short because I hear them upstairs. Eighty-five years was long, but not enough. It always catches.\n",

Many tales have been told of it's existence, and many have spent their lives searching for it. And now, thanks to a group of scientists working for Big Pharma, you can buy it over the counter. Bottled, carbonated and in the flavor of your choice. \n\nI was 28, not long off my 29th birthday when they broke the news. Science had done it, it had broken into the realm once thought only for Gods. Immortality could be yours, forever.\n\nBut only to those under the age of 26.\n\nI remember thinking how unlucky I was, missing the boat by only a couple of years, though my life carried on as normal and it wasn't until I was in my late 40s that I began to truly appreciate that fact. I started to slow down, aches and pains taking root, my skin wrinkling and my hair adopting a silvery hue. I was getting old. I wasn't the only one of course, there were lots of us, we of the \"Lost Generation\" as we came to call ourselves. Doomed to die as nature intended. I still meet with some regularly actually, getting to bitch about the entitled youngsters with others was welcome catharsis. Hell, I know one guy, missed the deadline by a day. A *day*. I couldn't imagine what that must have done to him. There aren't many of us left these days, Age claiming it's final victims slowly but surely, it'll be coming for me soon enough I'm sure.\n\nNot too long after it's release Goverment officials signed legislation that ensured everyone under the age of 26, regardless of race, gender or wealth, could access the drug. Once a person turned 18, they could decide to get the treatment, as Immortality had to be a choice, though to this day I still haven't heard of a single person who turned it down. Doesn't hurt, far as I've been told, just a couple of shots; one into your arm, one into the base of your neck. Probably not as bad as I make it sound and compared to Immortality, what's a couple of little pricks, right?\n\nNearly 60 years after the fact everyone I know is either an Immortal, or an old wreck like me. And for the first time ever, I'm glad that I never got that choice because in hindsight, what Age has put me through wasn't too bad and I know soon, hell, maybe even tomorrow, it'll be over.\n\nWe of the \"Lost Generation\" used to joke that the Immortals weren't human anymore, turns out we weren't too far from the truth. It's funny how in 60 years, no one thought to question how they did it, how they acquired immortality. I guess our fear of death blinded us to reality.\n\nGene-splicing. \n\nTake a bit of reptile, some insect, throw in a bit of flora for good measure, mix it up on a Petri dish and voila! Viral treatments to alter the genome, to turn off chromosomes, introduce new gene sequences to fill in the gaps and fix the degenerative nature of cell replication. The makings of an Immortal.\n\nAnd the death of Humanity.\n",

            "comment": "When I was 17 or so there was lots of hype about 'unlocking the secrets of immortality' something about dna or oxidation or something. I didn't really pay much attention. After all, how many 'health facts' lasted so much as a year before being changed for whatever reason? How many 'wonder drugs' that amounted to so much nothing?\n\nThen, nearly a decade later, they did it. 12 liters of 7 different drugs, carefully administered over the course of a week, to stop age for eternity, to stall death as long as could be. The only side effect they found was infertility. A boon more than anything, considering overpopulation.\n\nWell, the government swooped down on that procedure faster than a bullet, and within the week rules had been placed. 25~26. That was how old you had to be to take the procedure. No exceptions.\n\nAfter a while, those of us 27 or older started being called stuff like the 'old humanity' and 'final generation' and so on, while the younger ones, the ones who took the surgery where called the 'new generation'\n\nWhen I was 47, the last child of the 'old generation' was born. When I was 72, she took the operation. It was the end of mankind as we knew it. A quiet, lonly end that few noticed and even fewer mourned. \n\nThen, when I 85, the side-effects, the *true* side effects of the operation was discovered. The operation had not made anyone infertile. Far from it. What had happened was simple. The stopping of aging had simply slowed the growth of the embryo, so slow that noone noticed. And by the time it grew big enough to discover, advances in medicine meant noone ever visited the hospitals. But as the embryo grew, it's development accelerated, and now a decade since the first pregnancy was confirmed, pregnancies where being reported from all around the world.\n\nIt was on the news, even now. The first birth in nearly seventy years. I did not turn on the TV. My wife had passed two years ago, and I felt it my time coming. Whatever befell this generation of self-made immortals was their problem now. Not ours.\n\nBut no matter what happened, one thing was certain. This new child to be born, they would truly be the new humanity.\n\n",

            "comment": "I had always been resentful of my parents. All my life, I knew that my friends, my coworkers, everyone I interacted with would stop aging in their twenties, forever young and healthy and beautiful. And me? Well, my parents refused to have me vaccinated. After the first round of the anti-aging drug was administered to everyone under twenty-six, it was discovered that it worked best, and had the fewest side effects, if it was administered within the first year of life. So the government mandated that everyone be vaccinated against aging at birth--unless you had a religious exemption.\n\nNow, my parents are the least religious people you are likely to meet. However, when my mother discovered she was pregnant with me (an accident, she assured me. She never wanted to bring a child into this messed-up world) she and my father became \"born-again Christians\" in order to claim that religious exemption. They were among a minority of dissenting scientists and physicians who believed that the drug had not undergone sufficient testing, that more information was needed before subjecting humans to such a life-altering drug. So, when I was born, my parents had a priest present to vouch for their \"sincerity\" and \"piety\". Two days later, they brought me home, doomed to age in a world of perfect immortals.\n\nThey told me what they had done when I was twelve. They probably would have kept me in the dark for longer than that, but one of the side effects of the vaccine turned out to be delayed puberty. While all of my friends still looked like children, I had shot up 6 inches, developed breasts, and--much to my horror--started my period. Once my teachers and friends found out why I was so different, they treated me like an invalid. When you have an eternity to live, why waste your time on someone who will barely be around for a century?\n\nI left my parents' house when I was eighteen, and didn't speak to them for decades. I tried everything to thwart my aging body, all to no avail. I never found a partner; hardly anyone wanted to be my *friend*. I was an aging anomaly in a world of the perpetually young and beautiful, and I hated every goddamn second of it. \n\nThat is, until my fifty-fifth birthday. I had long since given up trying to hide my wrinkled skin and greying hair, and the cursed day was just another reminder of the fact that I was rapidly speeding towards my demise. I was in the middle of distracting myself from my dreaded mortality when I heard a knock on my apartment door.\n\n\"Who is it?\" I called, too lazy to get up from my sagging couch.\n\n\"Jess? It's Emma! Let me in!\"\n\n*Emma.* I hadn't spoken to her since--well, best not to think about that. \"Coming,\" I replied, my bones creaking a bit as I pushed myself off the couch and made my way across the room. I reluctantly undid the latch and pulled open the door. Needless to say, I was *not* prepared for what I saw next.\n\nEmma, perfect, young, gorgeous Emma, was absolutely *covered* in angry red lumps. They marred her previously flawless face, ran the course of her toned arms, and, judging by the awkward lumpiness of her jeans, scarred her legs as well.\n\nMy jaw hung open, speechless. I was frozen there, unable to make heads or tails of what stood before me.\n\nAs I stood there, Emma started crying. \"P-please,\" she all but whispered. \"You have to help me.\" \n\n---\n\nEmma sat in front of me, face grimaced in pain as I methodically poked and prodded each of the large red lumps. I collected samples from a few--they oozed a viscous white liquid--but I couldn't bear to see the agony on her face each time I would cut into one of the lesions. As I worked, I asked her a battery of questions. \"When did you start noticing the bumps?\" \"Oh, about a month ago.\" \"Where did they appear first?\" \"Just one or two under my armpits, then--\" she blushed \"--in my groin. I didn't think it was anything serious.\" \"Were they painful then?\" \"Not like now. Just tender.\" \"How quickly did they spread?\" \"There were new ones every day.\"\n\nI frowned, thinking. Even as a dermatologist--the Lost Generation still needed those, after all--I had never seen anything quite like this.\n\nI sat back and took off my gloves. \"Sit tight, Emma. I'm just going to take a look at these samples for a moment.\" She nodded, worry plain on her face.\n\nI sprinted down the stairs--sprinting was much harder now, I discovered--and turned on my high-powered microscope. *Just one of the perks of having an apartment right above my practice*, I mused. I spread the residue on a glass slide, placed a cover slip over it, and positioned it just so under the scope's powerful lens.\n\nI knew what was wrong immediately.\n\n\"Shitshitshitshitshit,\" I muttered as I ran back up the stairs, two at a time. The fatigue I felt barely even registered. I'd seen this thousands of times in my years of practice, but it was always in the Lost, the aging, the unlucky ones. Never once had I seen it in the younger crowd. In fact, the medical community considered it common knowledge that cancer would die out with the last of the Lost.\n\nI burst back into my apartment. One look at my face, and Emma burst into tears once more. \"It-It's bad, isn't it?\" she asked. I nodded, slowly. I took her hand, covered in the cancerous red bumps, and looked her in the eye.\n\n\"Emma, you have cancer. A type of cancer I've never seen before. Even melanoma isn't *this* aggressive.\"\n\nShe looked at me, dumbfounded. \"Are you sure? Th-They say--they say it's impossible...we-we're not supposed to get...\" she trailed off.\n\n\"I know,\" I responded. \"I thought so, too. But this is unmistakable. We need to get you to a hospital, quickly.\"\n\n---\n\nWe drove in silence, save for the occasional sob from Emma in the passenger seat. My mind whirred with questions and theories, all tangling with one another in a mad blur. The facts were clear: before now, the only people who got cancer were those who had not received the anti-aging vaccine. However, Emma's case had the unmistakable appearance of cancer, a cancer more aggressive than I'd ever seen. The vaccine included a safeguard against uncontrolled cell growth--at least, according to its developers. Yet the drug *did* act by elongating telomeres--the protective caps at the ends of a strand of DNA--which would seem like a perfect recipe for cancer. The only question left was, why *now*? Why fifty-seven years later?\n\nThat thought was interrupted by a long line of cars waiting to get into the hospital parking garage. The line did not appear to be moving; in fact, it looked as though there was an officer sending the cars away. \"What the...\" I mused out loud. Emma and I exchanged a look. Then, we both leaped out of the car, keys still in the ignition, and bolted for the emergency room entrance.\n\nThe ER was in chaos. Hundreds of patients--all perpetually young, like Emma--were crowded around the triage nurse, demanding to be seen. They were all covered in the exact same cancerous red bumps. Some had it so bad that they couldn't even stand up. On the television, the news anchor announced: \"The President has declared a national state of emergency. Anyone who has received the anti-aging vaccine should report to the nearest hospital or clinic immediately and await further instruction. I repeat, we are in a national state of emergency.\"\n\n---\n\n**Note from the author:** I found this prompt really fascinating, and I intend on continuing on my personal site: [The Ideatorium!](http://theideatorium.com)",

That date was two days ago, and he didn't come.\n\nAt  first, I comply assumed that he was a busy man. He worked long hours in  the office and over the course of the last 59 years, he's had many  promotions and many raises. and it seams even his children now are  becoming old enough to take the drug of immortality, like he did.\n\nSo today I decided to finally leave the home and go look for him myself. Maybe I can surprise him. Maybe I can even see him at work. I spoke to the people at the office, they seamed to think it was a bad idea to let me go. To hell with them, I'm not too frail. I'm strong as I need to be, and to prove it I escape through the window to search for mt brother.\n\nI go to his house and there's another family in there. I ask them about the previous owner, but they just assume I'm crazy and slam the door on me. And this used to be such a courteous neighborhood too. I guess many things have changed since I last was out.\n\nNext I go to his work and ask around, but they wouldn't let me up into the building. The receptionist tells me no one by that names works there. This is odd. Way too odd. Something is up.\n\nNext I go to his favourite cafe. He used to take his wife there all the time, including before they even got married. The barista was a long term personal friend of my brother, so if anything were to happen to him, I'm sure she would know. But she's not at the cafe.\n\nI ask the current barista about her, and he tells me it was his mother, and he also tells me where I can find his mother, but that she won't be able to help me. I must take the change, this is starting to drive me insane. I must see my brother again, soon I will die and he will live forever.\n\nCould it be that the previous barista was over the age threshold like me? The place he told me to look for her was at my very own retirement home! It's strange because she looked like she was in her teens when she was working at the cafe.\n\nLuckily the sun told me the ward too, which was different to mine. I sneak in knowing that when I turn myself in properly I'll get tighter security and won't be able to pull this stunt again.\n\nWhen I get in, I didn't find the barista. Instead I found my brother! he was there in the ward speaking to some of the folks there. I go up to him and shout his name being so happy that I get to see him again! But he looks at me oddly and gets up from his chair, feeling scared now that I'm advancing at him in such a fast manner.\n\nHe has no idea who I am! I ask him bout his job, his children, the cafe... Nada. I go into the bathroom to cry for a while and then finally turn myself in.\n\nThe drug of immortality after many years gives you periodical amnesia and problems with your memory both long and short term. Some people even forget speech entirely. The nurse explained to me. Not only that, but my brother has not come to see me in many, many years. I was told many times that I have Alzheimer's.\n\nIt's been three days now since my brother hasn't come and I leave this note because I've forgotten what he looks like and I know soon enough I will forget I even had a brother.",

What if one of those side effects was hostility toward the elderly, shouldn't we know about that!\" His righteous thunder left him when he realized how stupid he sounded.\n\n\"Of course, of course... and maybe that's exactly why we \\*don't\\*\" Jimmy added as he leaned forward conspiratorially.\n\nAbe waved him off. \"Bah, you always do this Jimmy. I was just making an example, not leveling accusations! Why do you have to make everything into us vs. them, or the Illuminati, or the Circle of Lazarus!\"\n\n\"Then why won't they tell us?\"\n\nAbe gave a gruff that said to mind your own damn business and leave well enough alone before turning to leave, the mood spoiled.\n\n\"Excuse me sir,\" an Ageless woman in a red coat tapped Abe on the shoulder, \"Could I trouble you for some cabbage?\"\n\nAbe stared at the woman with mouth agape. She impatiently tapped her foot and nervously adjusted her purse strap.\n\nJimmy stepped up, \"You're pranking us, aren't you. Do we look like a grocery store? We're not getting involved with whatever it is you're up to, you 'Thusela.\"\n\n\"I really need some cabbage!\"\n\n\"Yea I heard you the first time, and I said we want no part of it.\"\n\nThe Ageless woman started as if to cry but held back. \"But, but... I must!\" she hurried off with firm determination in an aimless direction.\n\n\"Well that was... uh...\"\n\n\"That must have been one of those side effects,\" Abe joked and Jimmy busted out laughing.\n\nAbe suddenly waved his arm in front of Jimmy in a protective gesture. \"Is that lettuce?\" motioning toward a trail of light green leaves trailing the woman's path. She hastily groped into her purse while she walked, and cabbage leaves spilled out as she dug. She was eating it raw and by the handful in a reckless, almost frenzied way.\n\n\"Whatcha reading?\" an Ageless man in a loose fitting suit with a silk scarf approached Abe in the brash way that young men treat the elderly.\n\nAbe replied automatically without thinking, \"A Brief History of Time.\"\n\n\"Oh cool, so it has dinosaurs and stuff in it? I could really go for a story about that!\"\n\n\"Uh, it's not exactly that kind of book.\"\n\n\"Nobody has what I'm looking for, I don't think I can hold on much\\-\\-\" the man was stopped mid sentence with his mouth hanging open as if to speak but forgetting the words. He looked unusually young for an Ageless. Normally they looked mid twenties forever, but this one looked like a teenager. No wait, he looked even younger than that. How didn't they notice earlier?\n\nFrom a bystander, \"It's true! Lazarexol doesn't just stop the aging process but it reverses it!\" pointing at the young man. \"We must give it what it wants, we must give it what it wants!\"\n\nPanicked, \"Does anyone know how to climb a tree?! It\\-it wants me to climb trees!\"\n\n\"Can it make you talk to sailors? How would it even know!\"\n\n\"So I didn't just build up the courage to go skydiving? I actually have to do it or else the Laz will kill me?\"\n\nAbe looked at Jimmy dumbfounded, they packed up their things and made a hasty exit.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nA ring of hooded monks stand around a circle chanting in ritual. When it became silent, a troubled monk stepped into the center. \n\n\"Brothers, I must inform you of a problem with our plan. We were going to make humanity great, but it turns out that we have no control over the suggestions that the Laz gives to people.\" He steadies himself and continues, \"Not only does the Laz seem to be programming people to carry out their objectives at a quickening pace and without direction from The Circle, but the objectives they are given are completely random and have nothing to do with our grand plan! I fear we did not understand what we were doing with the Laz.\" \n\n\"We tried to make humanity great, but we have failed! We did not understand, and in our arrogance...\"",

Not really surprising seeing how rich they all got, and how every single politician's life depended on EverLife's continued existence.\n\nThe first two generations didn't really show it that much. Sure, we got a lot more ugly kids, but people also got a lot fewer to keep the population count manageable.\n\nWith the third generation we old\\-timers started calling them Garys.

Garys everywhere. Some old. So many young.

Load a fresh shell and hobble towards the windows. Of course bars make it hard to see, but you can still shoot out of them.\n\n\"Hey John remember when it was just a simple day in the retirement home?\" Adam says while walking towards my room loading his faithful bolt action.\n\n\"I don't remember too much these days, with how many years we ran out of meds. I do remember you still owe me ten bucks.\" I tease back.\n\n\"You keep switching it, you owe me twenty bucks and a pack of cigs darn it!\" Adam starts peppering the hoard outside.\n\nThe magic shot, the immortality shot, forever young shot. All these words are now curses. We all sort of remember when it came out. Nearly all of us old timers can sort of think of the past.\n\nThe magic drug that allows one to never get old, boy how wrong and right that was. They never told you the side effects of course. Those blasted scientists only saw the green paper it made. Of course the oh so minor problem was ignored. It was a such a great promise for those who could take it. Immortality, to never age. As well as a huge side bonus of extreme regeneration. No one ever wanted to know the cost of course.\n\nWhat seemed like a minor glitch which everyone laughed off snow balled to ugly proportions. For immortality and nearly never being able to die, other then mass damage to the brain of course, you would just have a slight case of needing more meat. Just a little of course. That's how it always started, that slippery slope. Always that slight nudge in the wrong direction costs oh so dearly.\n\nThe side effects? You hunger, more and more for meat. They said it was just that the body needed more protein to balance out the after effects. Yea effects that kept getting higher and higher while no one noticed.  It of course started small, two hamburgers when before you could barley eat one. Five hamburgers became the norm for a sit down. Prices of meat started to rise, started? It sky rocketed to huge numbers. When a 10 year old would devour his weight in meat, there was a problem. Then the question, what happened when meat got scares? Now the real effects showed. The hunger it seems was larger and larger until all rationality was driven clear of the poor person.\n\nAt first all the animals were targeted... but after they ate all those they started looking for mature meat. Human meat. Old people meat.\n\nWho would guess that retirement homes would become bunkers. Once we pulled all the children we could in we hunkered down. People hoped that if they couldn't get enough meat they would just burn themselves out. Such an empty hope. We call them skinnies now. Easy to spot of course, having no hair and gaunt looks. You might mistake them for just a starving person. That would be the last mistake someone made. They seem small and weak, but they have some crazy strength, and they don't relent.\n\nEveryone always asks, where is the government for this. They had been the first to go. As they got the shots two  years earlier then the public. The irony the first to go looked the sharpest cloths.  \n\nPart 2\n\nIt didn't help that those in power used that power to hoard up all the meat which was left. The other larger problem was that all the egg heads and doctors had been on the second wave, the young ones of course. The older ones ended up all retiring and then kicking the bucket. Leaving the check to us \"younger\" oldies. \n\nThey of course as well figured out what was going on ahead of time. In hind sight the wars we had where just a prelude to the real war. The war to live. Us olddies didn't get much warning, but at the very least because the government pushed us to the side it might have saved us. Far enough away from the cities but close enough for a bit of food. When the walls fell the cities got hit the hardest. I can't even remember how touch in go things got back then. \n\nIt took some time to figure things out. Trying to get a hold of what was going on and how to get around them. Laud noises was always the best, but it also caused more to come. Cell phones had been a great boon leave one somewhere and call it they would rush over to that location, but those stopped working when no one was around to run things. Power? Yea that was still somewhat here or there, but power generators made a load of noise which again pulled the skinnies to the location. It wasn't normally worth the risk, but sometimes you would still need to get info out, and lucky for us ham radios still worked. Who would have thought classic tech would come back in style? \n\nThe problem of course was food, with no animals around meat was far harder to come by.\n\n\"Dang it John stop day dreaming and help me!\" Adam wheezes through clenched teeth. \n\n\"Oh sorry started to day dream there for a bit, next cig is on me.\" I hurry as my old bones creek to push the table over the window with Adam. \n\nThe sound of fighting can be heard all over the old bunk. It seems the search party prodded a nasty bee's nest. \n\n  \n\"It's going to be worth it, they found a truck with half a pallet of cat food. It might even be still good. I was just coming back from getting the kids into the safe room when the skinnies got spotted.\" Adam huffs as we finish fixing the window with the make shift table. Normally we wouldn't block the window, but this one's bars got bent from a mean tall skinnie. He's still smacking his lips at us, not worth the shells now that he's stuck.\n\nI use to hate the cafeteria, they always gave us bland food there. Now it's the safest place as the kitchen is made out of concrete.  \n\n\"John let's go we need to find out what's happening in the west side, there might be a breach.\" Adam hobbles off yelling back at me.\n\nI miss the good old days of just sitting and sleeping, at least then you didn't have to worry about some person coming up and nibbling parts off you. We are at least lucky, some other old homes didn't have any vets around and just folded over after the breakout. I suppose it could be worse, we had a school trip visiting us oldies when the walls fell. Otherwise these young kids would have been and a dire straight. I shudder thinking about it. ",

Healthcare prices aren't what they used to be\"\n\n\"The world isn't what it used to be, dear.\" Jane said, looking past me and into the hallway.\n\n\"I never expected for it to be like this.\" she continued. \"I always thought growing up that I'll grow old and retire to a farm, not working till I'm 84 then suddenly collapsing.\"\n\nI leaned over and gave her a kiss on her forehead. Her forehead was clear of any wrinkles or blemishes but her eyes never lied about their age.\n\nA knock breaks the silence behind us.\n\n\"Mrs. Doe, time for your medicine. Oh, am I disturbing anything?\"\n\nThe nurse looked hesitant to come in.\n\n\"No, please come in.\" \n\n\"It's awfully sweet of you to come visit. Are you her grandfather or father?\" she said nervously.\n\n\"husband, actually.\" Jane replied for me.\n\n\"Oh, I am so sorry. the awakening was before my time so I don't know what to expect when we see someone from the previous generation.\" the nurse stammered \"but that is so sweet that you stuck with him all this time, I've seen people nowadays go through 10-15 divorces.\"\n\nThe Awakening. Hah. I still cant wrap up my feelings for what happened that year, especially now that there's new evidence of a \"side effect\" to the fountain of youth that was discovered recently. I'm not particularly vexed about my own demise, but I'm torn about the strain it put on my wife and marriage. My wife was a 25 at the time, I was 28. Years went by as my body crumbled and withered while my wife stayed beautiful and youthful. She said it made me sexier till I was around 50, in the past few years... Well, I caught her crying one night hunched over. She was muttering to her self 'why can't I just give some of my youth to him.' 'Why did the government have to condemn him to death.'\n\nExtensive research continued on the fountain of youth for nearly a century. Everything seemed to go smoothly until recently when a wave of deaths from the earlier adopters of the drug started dying from one single cause: suicide.\n\nThis wasn't unheard of before, the few wealthy that were past the cut off line managed to buy fountain of youth pills to freeze their times, but when they hit age 85, they all started to commit suicide. CDC ruled it as a side effect of the lost generation taking the drug against strict recommendations, and it was promptly swept under the rug. This time around, it's from generation immortal.\n\n\"Thank you nurse, I feel a lot better now\" Jane said,\n\nThe nurse smiled meekly, and after collecting her tray, quickly left the room. Jane eyed her as she left the room and waited until she was out of earshot from where we were.\n\n\"I don't like how everyone treats you like that, it's like they see you as a monster.\" she grunted.\n\n\"Well, not everyone was as accepting to their fate as I was. There were three huge rio--\"\n\n\"I know that! I... know... It's just... I wish I could just tell them that you're not one of the people who caused those massacres. But all they see when they see white hair and wrinkles is a monster\" her voice quivered as she said.\n\n\"do you see me as a monster?\" I asked.\n\n\"no, you're my husband.\" she snapped.\n\n\"then, that's all I need.\" I said as I grasped her hand with my withered claw.\n\nshe ran her thumb across my knuckles while looking down. A silence ran through the room and even outside.\n\n\"I'm scared, John.\"\n\n\"We all are, sweetie.\"\n\n\"What if I go crazy like the others and just strangle myself with my own blankets?\"\n\n\"I wont let that happen.\" I said sternly \" but even if you do, It probably wont be long till I join you up there since I'm gen L\"\n\nHer punch on my arm wiped the crooked grin off my face.\n\n\"Hey, that smarts.\" \n\nWe both sighed at the same time and looked each other in the eyes. Her face grew red and her eyes watery.\n\n\"hey, hey, hey.\" \n\nI put my hand on her cheek.\n\n\"Whatever happens, I'll always be with you. I promise.\"",

            "comment": "When the government finally legalized the drug called Victus, you can bet that I was upset.   I was 28 for God\u2019s sake!  Still in the prime of my life and no idea why I had to be excluded from immortality just over a 2 year difference. There were riots on the streets of D.C. for my part, I organized the gathering of a few dozen covens and together we tried our hand at casting spells to compel lawmakers into allowing anyone of any age the opportunity to take the drug.  I was a hardcore devil worshipping witch back then.  I guess the lack of results from our coven gathering made me rethink my beliefs.  I became a white witch, and started a YouTube channel to share my knowledge.  It never really took off, either until maybe twenty years later.  Still, even then, most followers always wanted to know about demons and paranormal encounters.  My focus had always been more on the power of the self to manifest reality-and you can see now why my channel never really took off.  I had a whole community of haters, people professing their intense disappointment of me as a waste of human potential and a disgrace to real witchcraft.  YouTube fame was just not in the cards for me either, I had very quickly found out.  I just lived my life quietly, getting a very generous social security check from the government(a nice unexpected perk of mortality). I worked as a nurse-so I mean I wasn\u2019t some bum leaching off the government.  I grew up, grew older, celebrated each year as if it could be my last.  I remained a self-professed witch for my whole life and was pleased to see that it became the trademark of the immortals(I liked to kid myself that my lately burgeoning YouTube channel had helped influence this trend.). Around the time I reached 84 however, the news came alive with the most disturbing news I had encountered.  They reported it as the \u201cend-times\u201d, the apocalypse.  Disturbing cases of demonic attacks everywhere across the country.  I gasped as I saw a woman with gashes across her stomach (a gorgeous, desperate immortal woman).  She was crying about being attacked in her own home while she was asleep.  She had seen these grotesque figures as they hurt her, and ran into the streets.  This was happening to immortals across the nation, and all of them were saying that something was causing serious injury to immortals.  Something dark and twisted.  There were a lot of apparent suicides on the day I turned 84.  I couldn\u2019t understand it.   Over the next few weeks the hospitals became overburdened with people.  I went to YouTube to find out the actual truth.   An immortal man was filming his room.  \n\u201cThis shit is so fucking scary, I\u2019ve been sleeping with the lights on, I\u2019ve got motion detectors-and they\u2019ve been going off randomly.  You might even hear it during this video.\u201d The man was pacing in his room, massaging his face in obvious distress.  \u201cThis is the end times guys.  Fucking serious, we didn\u2019t believe in the Christian bible, well we fucking should\u2019ve because Satan is loose, and his demons are here to torture us.  See!  Did you guys see it?!\u201d The man pointed to an empty corner in the room.  \u201cI heard it talking to me, whispering.  It was saying \u2018Conner it\u2019s your fault, you thought you were god.\u201d  Conner pointed to the corner again.  \u201cYou guys are seeing it right?!  Right?!?!  So fucking scary!!\u201d  He was sobbing.  \nI couldn\u2019t see anything.  And in the comments, no one else could either.  \u201cDid you hear the motion detector go off guys?!\u201d  Conner looked at the camera pleadingly.  He grabbed a knife and I shrieked as he HELD THE BLADE, pointing the handle at the corner of the room menacingly, lopping off his fingers.  It took him awhile to notice, and when he did he hardly seemed to register it, focusing back on the corner of the room, as if his focus was enough to deter the threat. YouTube had to shut down after that.  Too many people committed suicide on livestream, claiming the demons were killing them.  After that, all social media sites also shut down.  \n\nHope you enjoy!",

Most people, mind you, would have had their fridges ordering online for them, automatically, selecting the menu solely based on their online history. Most people just sat around all day, being fed information and *fullfillment* while countless AI toiled at production, at least I still got a bit of exercise in my lonely existence.\n\nIt meant the aisles were quiet. Today was different though. Things were ominously quiet. I strolled through the revolving door, being harassed by a robot shop assistant, insistent she knew what I wanted - better than myself. Little did the bitch know I'd be making sushi for the first time.\n\n\"Would you like me to add a sushi making kit, Mr Miles? \" the robot said, hauntingly lifelike. \"Or did you receive one as a birthday present, from your neighbour Mr Jones?\". Otherwise I have a full cart prepared for you, including delicious salmon, sushi ingredients, meals, as well as recipes for your AI helper to follow.\n\n\"I'd rather just walk around myself, thanks,\" I replied. \"Let me know if you need anything then!\" as she floated away. I was still polite to them, anything else felt wrong, but God damn it I came here to shop, not to collect a delivery.\n\nIt was at this time that I noticed I was the only person in the place. I couldn't see any human staff, or customers, anywhere. Whatever, maybe there was some cyber game final on or something, who knows what these kids are into these days. And they almost exclusively are young these days. I don't blame them, I'd also stay young if turning back time wasn't an option. I'm one of the few left alive of the previous, and penultimate generation.\n\nFor my age I was pretty healthy. Well everyone was, actually. Medicine had come a long way, almost no condition was untreatable. Except dementia, which basically gets everyone some extent after a certain age. Unless you have regular epamycinate injections of course. Research into other treatments essentially stopped after the discovery. And hey, who cares I still have a good 20 years left in me with modern medicine.\n\nWeird that the place was this empty, though. My pocket vibrates and I reach into my pocket for my phone. Ah, my news app, not some dank memes from an old friend back home, as I'd hoped. The headline caught my attention though, *Epamycinate side-effects discovered*. Interesting I thought as I tapped and began to read.\n\n\"...*their penises begin to shrink at a rate of roughly 1cm per year after, on average, 50 years of treatment. *...\" I chuckled to myself even though I knew that scientists could regrow any organ with ease.

            "comment": "We all should have seen it coming. Something warned about since the beginning of the Bible. Yet who could turn down immortality? There were still the odd ones who did but most of them were considered nutcases. I suppose we all were too pleased with our achievements that we never imagined where it would lead us.\n\nI flicked through the last few pages\u2026 not much left. To think even Tolkien couldn\u2019t have written such a strange world. We had gone from the pinnacle of human achievement, beating even death, to now to a dystopia where human life has almost no value. What was left? I thought a few times of ending my own life or just coming out of hiding and letting them do what they want with me.\n\nI opened the cottage door and set off to look for more fire wood. My age was definitely catching up with me. I used to be able to zip through these woods straight down to the lake on our family trips, still have the scar from that misstep I took into that Willow. Never knew how valuable the time spent here would be until us Lost Generation were forced into hiding. I bent over to pick up some broken branches, what I would have given to have gone to a retirement village like the ones when I was young. \u201cWHAT THE HELL! IT\u2019S AN OLD GUY!\u201d his voice shot through the trees. Shit, what a time to get a creek in the back. I tried my best to power walk away but I knew it was hopeless. \n\n\u201cWell, well one of them still wondering around. Where\u2019s your stash old man?\u201d the burly red head said while his two friends held me up. \u201cI have nothing you\u2019ll want, just books and tattered clothes\u201d I knew they didn\u2019t care, they were probably as desperate as everyone else. \u201cYou must have some food, so hurry up and show us where you stashed it\u201d. \u201cIn my day we had respect for our elders and looked after them, that what it meant to be civilised.\u201d I said as I began walking towards the cottage. No use in wasting my time arguing, they\u2019d beat it out of me one way or another. \u201cYou know that time is long past, it\u2019s a dog eat dog world now.\u201d He twirled the switchblade between his fingers while Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb followed close behind. \u201cSo how bad has it gotten? It\u2019s been over a year since I went into hiding.\u201d my curiosity got the better of me. \u201cNo much different really, just less food and more people. Every now and then a turf wars break out, that\u2019s what drove my boys and I here. No one is really in control anymore, like I said dog eat dog.\u201d As he spoke I could picture it all happening again. \n\nWhen it was announced that we had found the cure for aging, cheers could be heard around the world. Man was master of all, nothing seemed out of his reach. Then came the news that only those under 26 could be treated, it seemed that the treatment required growth still to be occurring in the brain which tended to stop around 25 years old. Test on mice showed that ignoring this limit created bodies that never aged by brains wasted away, no one wanted that zombie apocalypse. Still it was a good deal, our kids were going to have amazing lives free from disease and physical ailments. The discovery was truly amazing! Even cell damage could continuously be repaired allowing for full limb or organ regrowth given enough time and care. Of course, there were those crying out against the treatments, saying man was playing God and stories of mutations of the trail patients but they were swept aside. Soon everyone eligible was being treated; it was a human right, the right to life. Then just by one the change in one question the world began to spiral out of control.\n\nWhat are you going to do with your life? Many a boy and girl would ponder this question as they grew and even as adults we were fixed on find our answer. When you have external life, the question loses all its meaning. You could do anything and everything, there was no time limit, no reaper awaiting you. Freedom without limit, yet no responsibility. Lacking a finite end life presented no urgency, no finality to choices, no higher meaning. Young adults put off all the things they\u2019d usually feel pressured to do to enjoy life. University attendance dropped while the clubs filled up. Kids were drowning in all the drugs and alcohol that could get their hands on. Teen pregnancy was on the rise while miscarriages and abortions fell. Babies from these new parents were conceived with the Cure already in their DNA. The Lost Generation were forced to work past their retirement as few of the Cured Generation had pursued further education and careers. There was too much life to live to think about those things now. And with fewer and fewer deaths the world became overpopulated with those who were too busy enjoying life to make a difference.\n\nWhat followed was a collapse in the social fabric that held us all together. As the Lost Generation began to die off there was only a handful of the Cured Generation willing to take their place. Years of just getting by and the constant need for the next dopamine rush drove most to taking menial jobs for very low pay. As the standard of living dropped, crime and public unrest increased. Finally the ever growing lower class lashed out at the government and rich, looting and pillaging wherever they went. Leaders arose amongst them blaming the lack of food and amenities on the privileged educated few and called for the class systems to be torn down so they could rebuild it into their own utopia. It was clear there was no remnant of a government left, rather pockets of new factions that struggled against each other for power. The Lost Generation became easy targets and soon they all were either in hiding or dead. \n\nWe rounded the last few trees and entered the small clearing. \u201cWoah, it\u2019s completely overgrown. Would notice it just walking by,\u201d said the Red head. There was no way of telling exactly how old he was, could be just turning 20 or could be nearing his 70th birthday. All I knew was that he and I were from completely different worlds. \u201cAlright then, how do you get in?\u201d he pointed the switch blade at me smirking. The cottage was surrounded by bushes and trees and covered in moss. My dad had been an avid hunter and when I was young he\u2019d take the family out to the cottage each year for hunting season. Since he\u2019d died none of my family had come back, we knew the cottage as his true home and the memories of time spent there had always been too sacred to desecrate by going there without him. It seemed fitting to me that the cottage had been overgrown, almost entombed by nature itself. Soon it was likely to become my tomb as well. I pulled away the ivy over the door and pushed it open. With the windows covered there was barely any light in the cottage. \u201cOkay boys let\u2019s see what we have here.\u201d As they slide into the cottage, he turned to face me, \u201cand no funny stuff, go stand in that corner while we take a look around.\u201d I was mentioned into the darkest corner of the room. Watching what little I had been thrown around carelessly, I began to realise what a pathetic situation we were all in. \n\nHere I was, old and grey begin held up for the scraps of my life by those who had been given the promise of a truly boundless life. All that was left for me was death and yet I felt like the lucky one. The three I saw before me were, I realised, the real Lost Generation, unable to find meaning in their lives as they had no way to grasp how precious it was. I came to understand the fateful passage: *And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.* This was not God\u2019s punishment but God kindness. Without knowing the limits of flesh we would never seek Him and in so doing seek to know ourselves and the purpose of our lives. We are just left striving to feed the flesh in a never ending destructive cycle. \u201cWhat do we have here, isn\u2019t this pretty?\u201d I could just make out the small glimmer of gold. \u201cAnd who is she?\u201d he asked smugly as he gab the blade into the locket to take the picture out. Anger instantly began boiling through me, I clutched tightly on the dusty coat next to me. It wasn\u2019t a coat rack holding this coat up, it was my father\u2019s old hunting rifle. I gripped it tight and pulled it closer. \n\n\u201cShe was a pretty one, I\u2019ll give you that. Too bad she wasn\u2019t our generation, then we could have had some fun with her too.\u201d One deep breathe in\u2026 I ripped the coat off and before they realised what happened, a loud bang and the first of his friends was on the floor. \u201cHoly shi!\u201d The second round went off and his was left standing there clutching her locket. \u201cOKAY I\u2019LL LEAVE, LET ME TAKE THEM AND I\u2019LL LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK\u201d he pleaded. Tears were rolling down my face, she had been my life\u2019s purpose. Together we had gone through it all and still held each other\u2019s hands right till the end. Though times had been rough my memories of her were of all the warmth and joy her life brought to those around her. She knew the value of life and made sure hers will lived to the full. I pull back the slide, rifle pointed straight at him. He\u2019s not even fit to know her name. Tick.\n\n\u201cOh you\u2019re gonna die now!\u201d he jeered as he pounced at me. I hit the slide with my hand trying to clear the jam but before I could look again he was right in front of me. Instinct kicked in and I immediately spun the butt of the gun into the side of his face then jabbed it into his nose. He stumbled back, disorientated. I had my chance! Time slowed down to a crawl as I felt the recoil of the rifle against my shoulder. He slunk back slightly then stopped for what felt like a minute. I could feel each breathe I took, deep and concentrated, not a single ounce of focus wasted. As he fell to the floor I felt the weight on my shoulders, the sudden realisation of how crazy this whole fight had been. I lowered the rifle and time began to speed back up. I slowly moved towards him body and reach out to pick up the locket. Suddenly I felt it, a sharp shooting pain in my side. As I lifted the locket my left hand clutched my side. The blood was now soaking through my clothes. I opened the locket, her picture was torn and tattered but too me she looked as perfect as ever. I made my way over to the easy chair and sat down slow. Well I guess there\u2019s only one thing left. As I find my place again a smile comes across my face for the last time. *End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain\\-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it.*",

I feel heavy, my joints ache, feet get bloated, I have to watch what I eat, when I eat, where I shit, when I shit. I just want to feel young for once. It pisses me off to no end that I was two years shy of the \"miracle\" drug known as Emergo. It stopped the aging process creating near immortality. Sure, some dumbass could wipe themselves from the face of the Earth by being stupid and gaining that prestigious Darwin Award, but living forever seems to have its perks. Never age, keeping your strength, strong mental facilities, and having a sex drive like a mollied up coke fiend on viagra. \n\nThe first year of the drug coming out, entire cities of millenials turned into an impromptu Olympic Village. People performing feats of strength and agility never before seen, then the constant fucking. God, so much fucking. It's how I met my first wife before I started showing the signs of aging. But upon realizing I was part of the lost generation, she went off and found herself another like herself, except the kid was 13 years her junior had she aged normally.\n\nSo here I am, standing in line like the rest of us old folks, waiting for my pharmaceuticals, when some Emergo asshole drives his truck through the store front. Being a former Army Doctor, I rush over to assess the kid. Kid seems like he's in a daze.\n\n\"Kid! Hey Kid! You alright? Do you know where you are?\" The kid looks at me dumbfounded.\n\n\"Alright, how many fingers am I holding up?\" Kid shrugs his shoulders.\n\n\"What, did you suddenly forget how to count or something?\" Aww damnit, he's got a concussion. Told you, limited immortality and all that shit.\n\nI pick up my phone and call 9\\-1\\-1. \"9\\-1\\-1 what's your emergency? Hehehe, eeeeeemerrrrgency.\"\n\n\"I got a kid here who just drove his truck through the store. He seems to have a concussion of some sort and needs medical attention, can you send over an ambulance?\"\n\n\"An ambu\\-.. Ambulance? Uhhhhhh, heheheh, sure.\" The fuck is going on?\n\nJust then I see a fire truck plow through the parking lot, wrecking the fucker and destroying tons of cars. What the hell? Just then I get an alert on my phone.\n\n*CDC Special Report: After conducting thorough autopsies of various recently deceased Emergo drug recipients, it has been discovered that significant deterioration of the brain occurs over time, eventually reducing rational thought, reasoning, and higher order thinking to that of a 3 year old.*\n\nI sigh heavily.. Just great, I'm surrounded by morons.",

            "comment": "Immortality, a pursuit of which dominated the human social consciousness for millennia. There are oh so many paths to it, whether it be immortality in genetics by giving birth. Immortality in prose by writing unforgettable scenes and immortality by science! \n\nI was a researcher for X-corp, a simple name with much darker ideologies behind it. We started out testing on guinea pigs, and rats until one day the U.S secretly approved of using prisoners as test subjects. \n\nIt was a far too high-profit investment they said, I felt sick to the stomach but I knew there was no turning back. So I worked endlessly with my colleagues developing the pills. Each time that a subject died, I would look up there history. \n\nLooking up reasons for why they should have died. One day, I met a handsome blonde young man he had been sentenced to death for the murder of his parents. In my heart, I had already come to terms with his inevitable death. Until one day in the lab, as I was fastening his restraints to the operating, ready to dissect him again. He looked at me with a look from beyond the grave.\n\n\"I know I'm going to die soon, just find my sister Amanda and tell her she's safe now.\" Jonathan said wistfully before he said that he was a specimen with no name. I make sure to never think about their names. \n\nBut I couldn't help but realize his humanity. Jonathan died on the operating table that day. The medicine's efficacy was too powerful and overwhelmed his organs. I felt the shame eat away at me until I decided to go to his sister. After the murders, she was sent to an orphanage and when I visited her I told her I knew her brother.\n\n\"You really saw him? How's he doing? They won't let me go to the prison, please tell me he's okay.\" She asked in an instant holding back her tears. I could tell her love for her brother and my shame just increased.\n\nI asked about her life with her brother hoping to find reasons he should die. But I felt less and less capable of finding such proof. She told me of her parent's heinous acts against her, and how her brother did what he did to protect her. \n\nI felt a rush of emotions that I suppressed and fleed from the orphanage without looking back. A lump was in my throat threatening to consume me whole. I walked back to the lab filled with a bitter melancholy which I hid from my co-workers. I worked to complete the pill and we eventually did, and never again did I meet another Jonathan. \n\nImmortality will never have morality, anyone who takes this pill will lose themselves slowly. I am too old for the pill to have any effects, after the age of 25 it is no longer possible to stimulate the stem cells. \n\nBut it was a blessing in disguise for me, I was now 28 and I can live knowing that I will one day get the punishment I deserve. There is just something cathartic about that, and these immortals will commit sin after sin and never be punished. But the true purgatory is the inability to live with yourself and eternal life. I've slept soundly since then, I will be punished one day and I will greet that day with glee.",

            "comment": "First time trying this.... Be gentle\n\nIt turns out that it was the best thing that never happened to me...\n\nIn 2019, the FDA approved shipment of an experimental drug that stopped all aging on humans. Evidently, the government was secretly developing and testing this drug for decades, and in a last-ditch effort to save his first term, the president signed an order that made taking the drug compulsory for everyone born after 1993. I was just a few years too old, and over the course of a day, I became a member of the not-so-fondly termed \"Lost Generations\". Or as we thought of ourselves: the discontented masses. \n\nNow, needless to say, everyone from ages 18-26 rushed to the voting booths in record numbers, and reelected the president in a landslide. \n\nIn the following years, there arose two classes of people: \"The Chosen\", as the inoculated were calling themselves, and \"The Forgotten\", to rub in the fact that The Chosen would live forever. The Chosen got the best jobs, favorable loan rates, housing options, etc. And just like that, a modern-day Caste system was born. \n\nIt wasn't until the mid-2050s that The Forgotten began to hear rumors of The Chosen going berserk and killing everyone around them. Naturally, the people reporting these stories were dismissed as drunks or conspiracy nuts. \n\nAfter a while, the rumors became impossible to ignore; after previously virile individuals started to appear deathly thin, their skin yellow and brittle, and their teeth rotting out of their mouths. On my mail route, it became commonplace to see dozens of Chosen collapsed next to their front doors, unable to get inside, begging for someone to end their suffering. \n\nNow in my 80s, The Forgotten have started joking about the plight of The Chosen. The prevailing theme is that these side effects are what the Government was counting on all along. I initially ignored these ludicrous tales; no way  could my beloved country have done this to her own citizens.  \n\nAs I think about these stories more and more, I'm beginning to remember the state of things in my 20s: Climate Change was an imminent threat, overpopulation was putting our food supply in jeopardy, and racial tensions were rising to alarming levels. \n\nNow, however...",

But when the wealthy began using this medicine, I remember the media and the politicians raged about the rich versus the poor.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t soon until the politicians legislated equality of life for all - rich, poor, black, white, latino... you know. Though they had one condition. They said only 26 and under. I was 28. They said there were risks for those who already \u201cnaturally matured\u201d. We knew it was horse shit. The scientists who made the drug said age didn\u2019t matter. The president at that time already took the drug. \n\nNo - the cost of rolling out the treatment to everyone would be too expensive. That\u2019s the real reason and everyone knew it. Though if you really wanted the treatment, live forever, it\u2019ll cost you $220,000 in Mexico at the time.\n\nI didn\u2019t have that money.

Something like 57% men and 43% female. Nobody could explain it then, except those anti-life pill activists. They were mostly religious kooks, but I thought they were onto something. \n\nThere was 1 woman to 7 men. That was about thirty years ago. The government finally halted the treatments and banned it completely. But it was too late. The treatment also affected their children...\n\nMy wife just passed away last year.

Jeremy was a bastard of a man. Once a brawny lumberjack of great height, who had shrunk a considerable deal over time, and was now of normal height.

You see, when I was a lad, we had a Jewish fella what lived down the...\"\n\n\"What about the news?\" Harold asked. Sometimes it was important to keep these older chaps on point. They were pushing mid-nineties. A lifetime away from where Harold sat at 84. \n\n\"What news?\" Jeremy asked.\n\n\"What!?\" Leonard yelled.\n\n\"Jeremy was talking about the news Leonard, yah deaf bastard. Where is your hearing aide?\" Harold asked. Leonard was essentially the anti-American Express ad for hearing aides. *Never leave home with it.*\n\n\"Mildred must have hid it from me. You know she can be sneaky like that.\" Leonard said, using a rather selective hearing method.\n\n\"You gentlemen need another drink?\" A waitress had popped up seemingly out of nowhere. But, to be fair, anybody walking at a brisk pace was seeming to pop up out of nowhere for Harold these days. \n\n\"Jesus! What are you trying to do? Give me a heart-attack!?\" Yelled Jeremy. \n\n\"Jeremy, if i wanted to, I could have given you a heart attack a long time ago honey.\" The young waitress said. \n\n\"Oh, you vile temptress.\" Jeremy said, \"Alright, put the next round on me.\"\n\n\"Why thank you Jeremy.\" Harold said. \n\nAs the waitress walked off, Jeremy eyed her up and down, \"Oh, if I were only 60 years younger.\"\n\n\"Then you'd still be ten years too old for her you ancient bastard.\" Harold said, which spawned a laughing/coughing fit from Leonard.\n\n\"Ah, whatever. You young bucks don't know what it's like to be my age.\"\n\n\"What!?\" Leonard yelled.\n\n\"I'm only ten years younger than you.\" Harold said. \n\n\"Well, the difference between 84 and 94 is like the difference between young Philly and a dead horse. Hell, when I was your age, I was running marathons and could bench three hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"Hah! I loved Family Matters.\" Leonard chimed in.\n\n\"Jeremy, I knew you when you were my age, and you were just as decrepit as you are now.\" Harold said.\n\n\"Well...\" Jeremy took time to think of a comeback, which in terms of a heavily medicated 94 year old was much like watching molasses swallow a city. \"You should mind your elders.\"\n\n\"That Urckle was hilarious!\" Leonard said.\n\n\"Ah. You got me.\" Harold somewhat admitted defeat. It wasn't that he felt he should respect his elders. Hell, he *was* an elder, but it was a good way to drop the subject. Especially with Jeremy. \"Anyways. What was the news?\"\n\n\"Oh right! The news!\" Jeremy shouted. \n\n\"Your pints gentlemen.\" The waitress popped back in. \n\n\"Ye gods woman! You need to wear a damned bell!\" Jeremy exclaimed.\n\n\"Right.\" The waitress put the drinks on the table and walked off.\n\n\"You know, if I was sixty years...\" Jeremy began.\n\n\"...Yes. Yes.\" Harold interjected. \"Anyways, what did you see on the news?\"\n\n\"Oh yes! The news. So, remember that drug that kept all those little bastards young?\" Jeremy asked, as if there was any way to forget the anti-aging drug.\n\n\"Yes. I remember.\"\n\n\"Well, it turns out it gives you stage 4 lymphoma! HAH!\" Jeremy brought a fist down onto the table in exultation. \n\n\"Ye gods.\"\n",

We reached out to it and brushed it with our fingertips.\n\nIn fact, we pretty much had it in our hands.\n\nThe patient, Thomas Jin age 124 fully cured from chronic cancer.\n\nHe had never felt better, in fact he looked like he was 50 again.\n\nOne medication for all the illnesses. Just one shot a year and you\u2019re good.\n\n\"The nanomachine is programmed essentially to be able to change into whatever you want it to be. Using\nT-waves we can give it commands, repair this nerve here, agonize that receptor there, block this\ntranscription pattern etc.\"\n\nProblem was, nanomachines did whatever the T-waves told them to do.\n\nPretty soon T-waves were being used by every military organization there was.\n\n\u201cWe need a self-automated bot\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean an autonomous robot?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it wouldn\u2019t be \u2018autonomous\u2019 as in like conscious just enough to give itself orders.\u201d\n\nIt was a success. However this bot required more frequent dosages, once per month. They couldn't have that, once a month was such a hassle. Nobody had time for that.\n\n\u201cWhat about a self-repairing bot? Or one that was a lifetime dose?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think we could do that? Is it worth it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell why wouldn\u2019t it be worth it? The shareholders are all on board, Nanotherapy is the hottest thing\naround these days. We\u2019ll call it \u2018Infiniject\u2019 generic infininan.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how do we make money if we just pretty much cure everyone?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell someone\u2019s gonna do it, if it isn\u2019t Nanozyme then it\u2019s gonna be TEVA-pro. WE gotta be the ones to\ndo it and I bet they\u2019re saying the same thing over there.\u201d\n\nEveryone was worried, more than anything, what would happen if Big Pharma painted itself into a\ncorner.\n\nNanozyme won the race though. Eternibot (generic eternan long acting) was approved for phase 1 trials October 11, 2105.\n\nChester Prin was happy to switch over. Age 85 he was one of the first to try nanobots and they had\ncured his Alzheimer\u2019s. He was young and pretty healthy with previous exposure to nanobots so he was an ideal candidate. He got his physical scan, a poke in the spine, and he was sent on his way along with\nthe other 8 candidates.\n\nFive months later he appeared to have developed some eye pain.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with his eyes. A neurological side effect? Could be of concern. Will\nmonitor further. Come back next week.\n\nFour days later he was dead.\n\nThe nanomachines were not stable. They had done their job, but as with anything small they were easy\nto break. Easy to change.\n\nWhen they found him he had 5 eyes, an extra kidney, and 2 hearts. Not to mention 2 fingers growing out\nof his right ear.\n\nThey would need to contact the others and bring them in to examine them. Constant surveillance. They\nhad to figure out what went wrong. They had to make a more stable machine.\n\n---\n\nThe hospital was under quarantine. Only those with hazard suits were allowed in or out.\n\nThe machine changed too rapidly. And reproduced, feeding off whatever power source it could find. Be\nit heat, molecular, solar. It fed off any material it could find stringing together molecules, particles,\natoms to form ever more incomplete copies of itself.\n\nThe inside of the hospital was a nightmare.\n\n\u201cToo much life if you could call it that. Mutilated people everywhere, too many organs all over the place,\nit\u2019s chaos.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026no antibiotics don\u2019t work, antibiotics kill bacteria. We need anti-nanomachinotics or something\u201d\n\nBlood on the walls, blood on the floors, blood on the ceilings.\n\nExcept not all of it was blood. The blood cleaned off, but the wall was still red.\n\n---\n\nRust, they called it. Too late they discovered the machines were not confined to organic material.\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t no zombie apocalypse that\u2019s for sure. A zombie apocalypse at least has a solution- blow the\ndamned heads off all the zombies. There\u2019s too many heads here to blow off, wouldn\u2019t do anything\neither.\u201d\n\nThe reddish stain reached soil and spread like wildfire.\n\nThe government of the United Americas stated the whole state of Massachusetts was to be\nquarantined\u2026 and probably burned to the ground.\n\nPeople panicked. Freedom of speech got to them.\n\n\u201cThe people got to know what\u2019s happening\u201d\n\nPeople ran.\n\n---\n\nThe mushroom cloud could be seen for miles.\n\nProtests, sanctions and all manner of outrage rocked the world.\n\n\u201cWhat is America thinking? Have they all gone mad over there?\u201d\n\nBut at least the machine was contained.\n\nRadiation kills people pretty well.\n\nIt kills a lot of things pretty well.\n\nApparently it doesn\u2019t kill nanomachines as well as they had hoped.\n\nThere was no way to stop it. 2 more nukes were dropped before they realized it was too late.\n\nThe United Americas started upping their space program.\n\nTheir statement at the World Conference was simply: \u201cWe\u2019re getting the fuck outta here, we suggest\nyou guys do too.\u201d\n\nOutbreaks appeared in Europe. The Communist East Union also soon began seeing it spread through its territories.\n\n6 more mushroom clouds hung in the horizon.\n\n---\n\nIt was time to find a new home.",

            "comment": "Funny how much difference 2 years can make in a person. I remember when they first announced that \"Jiaogulan\" was going to be put on the shelf for commercial consumer use. Some Thai Scientists cracked the genetic code for aging only downside, I was 28. During Human trial testing anyone over the age of 26 who consumed the drug were prone to hallucinations, vomiting, and severe cardiac distress. Simply put it was considered unethical to allow anyone past the cut off to use the medication, life continued its impending march of age for Me and the rest of the \"Antiques\" as the Immortals so affectionally put it, as if they dont give us enough hell already. Anyways im rambling...as i tend to do alot at this age, Oh! Of course thats what i was leading up to, today is my birthday, im 87. Its been 2 years since the side effects of \"Jiaogulan\" began to arise and truthfully its been pretty nice because now they need us! Thats right! The whole damn lot of them! Ageless litle brats cant even step outside into direct sunlight without 100 percent coverage of their bodies. Their bodies have become extremely reliant on Iron which has made them resort to constant blood transfusions. Their Canine teeth have lenghtened to an extreme degree along with their fingernails. The most regrettable part is they are now all barren and impotent no longer able to produce anymore children, But at least they'll never age i suppose. Now us Old Geezers are their caretakers, its good to feel needed again even if its forced upon them. ",

            "comment": "I want to see my mother and my father again. All of my family who have passed on. I want to see all of my sweet, sweet dogs\u2014Ainsee, Goliath, Horace and Missy. There were all good dogs. But most of all I want to see my sister again. She was only a couple of years older than me, however just above the cut-off age, and I...just below. I was permitted the gift. She, and everyone else I knew older than me, was not.\n\nThe news says that the scientist who discovered the secret to countering the effects of aging has herself now died. She developed the regimen. The daily pill\u2014or rather, the gift, we called it, at the time\u2014and the monthly, quarterly and annual bodily inspections and tune-ups and replacement parts all of which are now routinely provided by the healthcare centers.  She chose her death. Her last words were: \"Immortality is not a gift. Death is.\" Her final breath broadcasted live on her video blog as she injected herself with a euthanasia drug.\n\nNowadays when I walk down the street, thinking of those who, ages ago, passed on, the last to die a natural death, and I look around at our society\u2014at the stagnation, at the lack of young people, at all the old buildings whose faces are all kept clean and brightly painted but still, somehow, seem to be crumbling from the inside out\u2014I wonder whether she, the discoverer of the gift, was right. I wonder whether my sister was the lucky one.\n\n\"You don't have to worry about a thing,\" my sister had crooned on her deathbed. \"There's a better place. I know there is.\"\n\nI shook my head in disbelief and rage. Stupid government cut-off ages. Insipid regulations! I grasped her frail, mottled hand in my own yet fresh, strong, young-looking hands. \"I've known this was coming...I've known...but now that it's here, it's just...so unfair!\" I felt the tears run hot down my cheeks. \"Unfair!\"\n\nShe shook her gray head calmly. Wiped the tears off the tip of my chin with the blanket off the bed, there, in the dying place. \"I'll live on here,\" she had said and pointed to my heart.\n\nShe passed on the following morning.\n\nI went on a ten-day bender, drinking myself till I blacked out, after that. I ended up having to go for a tune-up and parts replacement a month sooner than scheduled...\n\nAs I walk down the streets these days, I see people protesting. Signs saying: \"Death is *the* gift God gave to mortals! It is hubris to deny it!\" and \"Down with the mandatory pill-popping!\" and \"All of humanity will go extinct if we keep on like this!\" Funny, that the pharmaceutical and medical technology which enables longer life, as well as better quality of life\u2014no fatal diseases, nothing barring a gunshot wound to the head or heroin overdose can be life-threatening\u2014than ever before, have brought about the real societal scare of humanity going completely extinct. Because we won't have chlidren. Because most of us can't anymore...\n\nThe drug's side-effect is total and thorough. My body, too, will not produce eggs anymore. I have some frozen, in an egg bank, but the supply is finite and I've never found any mates I wanted to have children with. Now I know I never will. That's okay. I never much minded living alone.\n\nBut I don't want to face true eternity alone. I hope beyond hope that what my sister believed in is actually true. That there is a better place and that I will see her again. Oh God, I hope...\n\nThere are thousands of people, nowadays, gathering in public places committing mass-euthanasia. Hands held. Holding flowers to their chests. Breathing their last together.\n\nThe government, I expect, will lift the mandatory rules. The few young people there are will never be given the gift and they will be forced to age and die. The gift will probably end up banned itself. People will have to fear death once more. But maybe they'll learn from us, from our generation. Maybe they'll learn that after the long years of life, after all the suffering and the bearing witness to suffering\u2014which of course has not ceased, if anything we've only become *more* greedy, not less\u2014that it is indeed a gift to die. That death is indeed brother to mankind. A long lost brother we can finally welcome home...\n\n\"I will tell myself this,\" I say to myself, as I walk down these streets. \"When I finally lay myself to sleep...\" And what a sleep it will be. Rest, at last. \n\nI pray now, though I never did before. Prayers are all I have left.",

            "comment": "\"Are you comfortable? Do you need anything before we get started?\"  The camera was pointed squarely at Ulfhild Halvorson, and a scrawny sound guy fidgeted with the boom mic in the corner. The large Norseman shifted a bit in the comically oversized chair and sighed.\n\n\"Geoff, you could have just used a regular chair, it's not like I need to be anything but human for this right?\"\n\nHe had agreed to tell his tales, mostly out of respect for Geoffrey's father. He'd been a life long friend, well human life long friend at least. Now though, as the lights were on and his very existence was about to be thrust into the spotlight, he was having second thoughts.\n\n\"What do you even want to know?\"\n\nGeoff's widened and he leaned in excitedly, \"Everything! But if you want you can start with something that's easy for you to recall. No need to jump into the deep tracks right off that bat. That's what editing is for!\"\n\n\"Well... My name's Ulfhidld Halvorson, I was born in roughly 933 AD, in Norway. I've loved, lost and loved again.. and what I remember most is the wars.\"\n\nThe young film maker seemed shaken, \"The wars? I mean I guess that's cool, but what about like the cultures and places you've seen?\"\n\n\"Do you know why I've seen so many cultures? Because I keep being sent to destroy them. For  literally a hundred years I was sent off with the raiders to take land and spoils for my clan. They called me the Killing Wolf and left me locked up alone until I was needed. Those raids were easy, there wasn't much a human could do to stop me back then. A sword or arrow isn't much against an 8 foot wolf with a human's intellect.\"\n\n\"So you aren't half man half wolf?\"\n\n\"No you've seen too many movies. I wasn't bitten, I'm not cursed. I guess for lack of a better term I'm a god, if that word means anything. Look here's the basics.. Human form I look like this. Only difference is I'm disturbingly strong, heal insanely fast, and haven't figured out what can kill me yet. Wolfie version is just that.. Big 700lb wolf. Think grizzly bear size without the stupid can't run down hill thing. Never got why bears never figured that out. Anyways, back then I only stayed with my Clan because I feared life would be worse with another. They'd scout a village or settlement for me, I'd roll in crush some helmets, rip off a leg or an arm of a nobleman, and that'd be it. I'd make a big show of following the orders of whichever raider was in command, and the poor people we were devastating would be subjugated by fear. Then back into the cage until I got home and was free to roam. It wasn't until we raided the British Isles that I decided I needed a change. I found a woman who warmed my heart, and settled down. For close to 20 years I only changed three times... and that was mostly for show.\"\n\nThe sound guy piped up, \"I thought you changed every full moon\"\n\n\"Myths created to make humans feel at ease. Can you imagine the panic if they knew I could turn it on and off on a whim?  Anyways where was I.. When my wife passed I moved on. Took up residence in Scotland for a while. Kept my head down until the early 1300's. Some fool named Bruce had riled up the country. Fought with my friends a bit, but the problem with human friends is they're particularly squishy in combat. In face those were the first Battles I can remember having to deal with properly armored humans. Claws and teeth are great against flesh and leather... but chain link and plate is bad for dental hygiene. . I actually started staying in my human form and using an axe for the first time in 300 years. I'd go rambling into the fray and send some bodies flying as I swung my axe. It did get tiresome, there was always another battle to be fought or lord that needed smashing. Eventually I fled south to France. Made myself a good name as a warrior in the Kings army. Even became a musketeer for a bit. Also not like the movies. But I did learn to use firearms. That was fun, ranged combat lacks the intimacies of a melee... but it feels too easy that it's lost its importance. Besides I found that while I heal quite quickly... bullets often took a larger chunk with them. It wasn't a problem, but it wasn't necessary. Guns forced me to go back to using the wolf in combat. I'd only attack in the woods and hit and run entire groups at a time.\"\n\nGeoff tried to steer the conversation a bit, \"What about the World Wars?\"\n\n\"Mustard Gas and Artillery? Tanks and Airplanes? No thanks, unless I wanted to test my mortality to its limits I was done with human wars.  I moved to Canada and lived in the wilderness. That's were I met your dad. In the 1970's I was hunting some elk, in full chase mode when I saw him lift his rifle. I figured it was gonna be another 'hunter lost in the woods' situation when instead of firing at me, he just waved. Like a goddamn idiot. I laughed so hard I literally fell out of my wolf form. I'll never forget your dad's reaction. He just pulled out his flask and threw it in the bushes.\"\n\nGeoffrey smiled, \"Dad always said you got him to quit drinking.\"\n\nUlfhild smiled. \"He was a good man... So what's next Want me to tell you how I learned how to transform the first time?\"",

            "comment": "\"...Bro?\" \n\nLeonard stood at the base of the platform, arms crossed in frustration. He couldn't believe it. This sappy-looking, scrawny twit of a teenager had discovered what had taken him years - *years* - to figure out on his own. He had dedicated his entire life looking for a loophole in time travel, to get around the requirements of FTL travel and proximity to a black hole, and this idiot had gotten there first. What was more, instead of using his knowledge to benefit all of mankind, he had made himself king. *King!* How selfish could one person be?\n\nThe king, on the other hand, beamed down on him. \"Yeah, bruh.\" He said. \"How'd ya do it? It was easy for me. See, it turns out we're in...like...a simulation, or something?\" He said. \"I'm a little foggy on the details. Made the whole thing up while I was stoned...still kinda stoned, actually. They've got some wicked herbs here, man. But it all kinda just came to me, ya know?\" \n\n\"It just...came to you?\" Leonard asked. He shut his eyes, wishing he could forget everything he just heard. \"It took me over a decade to figure it out. At least you had the sense to dress the part. You...*did* dress the part, didn't you?\" \n\nThe monarch stared at him blankly. \"...No? At least...I don't think so? They didn't have jeans back now, did they?\" \n\n\"No. No jeans.\" He said, smoothing his tunic. \"So where did you get the robes? Did the king just give them to you or something?\" \n\nThe boy grinned wider. \"Yeah man!\" He said, showing off the purple cloth. \"He just sort of threw them at me the second I showed up! Was yelling something about a prophecy, but hey. I'm not gonna complain - free stuff! How much you think this crown is worth?\"  \n\n\"You should really have planned a bit better you know, if you were trying to go into the past.\" Leonard said. \"You could have gotten yourself killed!\" \n\n\"Hey man. I didn't actually *plan* on anything.\" The teen said, frowning. \"It just sort of...happened. One moment, I'm laying on my back, looking at the universe through my third eye and stuff, and the next, *woosh!* There's this big purple portal, and I land myself right in the middle of the courtyard, ya know?\" \n\nLeonard stared. \n\n\"You mean to say....you didn't actually do anything?\" He asked.\n\n\"Nah, man.\" The teen said. \"In fact, I'm not a hundred percent sure this whole place is real. But if it isn't, this is one hell of a trip, ya know?\" \n\nLeonard turned away, deep in thought. He, too, had seen the very same portal - though, it had been where and when he had been expecting it. Though, not exactly - if he was being honest, it had been a few seconds early. In truth, he wouldn't have stepped through it at all, had it not grown suddenly and launched itself at him like the mouth of an enormous worm. At the time, he had chalked it up to a simple miscalculation, but now he was not so sure.\n\n\"If you didn't mean to come here,\" He asked the boy, \"and if I was brought here against my will...what on earth was that portal?\" \n\n\"It was *my* doing.\" Said another voice, sonorous and deep. From behind the throne walked a man - old, with a white beard and periwinkle blue eyes that seemed to pierce straight through Leonard's heart. He wore robes long enough to scrape the floor, a pointed hat, and an expression that was equal parts sorrow and joy. \n\n\"I am Merlin.\" Said the man. \"Leonard, Arthur...we have much work to do. I pray that we might start now.\" ",

Maybe a little dry for some tastes, but make an effort to get into it it and you might just love it. It essentially created the modern Arthurian legend.\n\nThe Once and Future King is one of my favourite books full stop. Very easy reading - funny, emotional, captivating. Highly recommend them both, for different reasons.\n\nInformative discussion on the subject: \"How does Merlyn experience time?\"\nhttps://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/15146/how-does-t-h-whites-merlyn-experience-time\n\nObligatory relevant xkcd (with explanation):\nhttps://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/270:_Merlin",

Actually, don't answer that. I don't care. I'll answer for you: a long fucking time. Like years. Like blood, sweat and tears all coalescing into a single destined moment.  \nCause that's what it was, man. Destiny.\nThere's no other way to explain it. Just the single greatest invention in the history of time that, by the way, rewrites the history of time. No biggie.  \nYet, here before me, this putz sits on his God damn throne, making his minstrels play Kanye West tunes while I stand slack jawed unaware how the fuck he did it.  \nHis face is withered, with scars along the edge of his left cheek. It would look scary but he covers most of his face with a thick beard. As far as royalty goes, he looks like he's had a hard fight for this throne.  \nCause that's the terrible fucking thing about time travel: it's never certain. Like, did I invent time travel? And he's just from the future where I've sold patent? Or did he invent time travel and decided to rule a kingdom?  \nChrist, I have a headache already.  \n\"How?\" I finally mutter.  \n\"Same as you broseph. I traveled through time,\" He smiles and brushes a long strand of grey hair out of his face.\n\"But...\" I start to stammer but he cuts me off.  \n\"Bro, you want taquitos. I gave them a recipe and you'll never believe how good they taste. Like, all food, bro. We can cook up whatever you want and it'll taste ten million times better because it's not processed and shit. I've lost, like fiften pounds from that alone. I call it the Time Travelers Diet. Patent pending,\" He laughs.  \n\"Actually, now that you mention patents...\" Again I get cut off quickly.  \n\"What about a chamber maid? They will do ANYTHING you ask.\"  \n\"I don't need sex.\"  \n\"Everyone needs sex. Real talk, can't lie, the sexually transmitted diseases thing is a bit of a crap shoot. They don't have great meds like we got back home. Every chick you sleep with is basically a bacterial Russian roulette here.\"  \n\"Listen,\" I pause because I'm not sure what to call him. I extend my hand, looking for help. He graciously obliges and calls himself King Yeezus. I almost say it out loud but logic takes over and I settle for your highness. \"What century are you from, exactly?\"   \n\"Same as yours, bro,\" He smiles.  \n\"Ok, what century am I from?\" I question him. Trying to figure out his game. He just smiles. It's an odd smile. The kind you get when you've just said something witty and can't contain your pride.  \nThat's when it clicks.  \nNo. No. No. No. I find myself saying it out loud. But the King just laughs.  \n\"This conversation is a lot more fun on this end,\" He slaps his knees. \"I always wondered when you'd show up. Or should I say when I would show up. Things get fuzzy. Time, man. It's all circular. But don't worry bro. You're going to have a great time. Scary sometimes. But great. Trust me. As you. The older you. Trust me. You're going to run now. Hop in that machine and race to too many places to count. Too many times to track. But something will happen. And you be stranded. Then it's a waiting game. You'll wait decades for me. Going, hell I'll admit it bro, a little mad. But, great news, you definitely won't get an STD for a couple decades yet.\"   \n\n        ",

When you're \"beamed\" (teleported), the teleporter takes you apart and creates a copy on the other end. That body has your memories, your personality, but it isn't really you, because your original consciousness is gone. You're dead. The person who steps out of the teleporter is just a copy of you.  \n  \nWhen your body is taken apart, you die - a body that's completely atomized cannot sustain consciousness. The biological processes that make you sentient are stopped, and even when the body is rebuilt and the processes are restarted, it's not the original process - that process had already ceased.  \n  \nSo now, let me ask /u/Vimiscus' question again, in more clear terms - how exactly would the time machine transfer you through time and space? If it used some kind of wormhole that would tranfer your entire body unaltered, that would work - you would survive the transfer. But if it dissolves you and simply builds a copy of you in the desired time and space, then you won't survive. Your body will, as will your ego (personality), but not your consciousness. The copy won't know it, but in the moment you stepped inside, your life would end.",

Teleportation is simply the concept of instanenously transporting matter through space. There are many other ways we could potentially do that - for expample, wormholes (which bend space around them to the point of creating a \"shortcut\" from point A to point B) or quantum tunneling (a fascinating phenomenon where a particle can randomly teleport from point A to point B for no apparent reason other that in the world of quantum physics, the laws of physics don't quite seem to work the way we're used to)  \n  \nWe are still trying to figure out how either of these things work, but if we could somehow reproduce them and harness them for our own purposes, safe teleportation could be within our reach. Not only it would allow instantenous travel here on Earth, but it could even allow faster-than-light space travel, ushering us into a new Space Age of interstellar exploration.",

There is an argument that this continuity is actually irrelevant, only an illusion, and actually makes the Star Trek beaming problem, not a problem.\n\nI would argue that this continuity is extremely important however.  We are 3-Dimensional beings, imprisoned by 4th-Dimensional time.  Our continuity of experience is basically what defines our existence.  Is this arbitrary? Perhaps, but the Star Trek problem breaks that continuity in a drastic way, leading one to think that you actually are dying with each beam.\n\nExcept for one last bit... Our continuity *is* broken, nearly every day.  When we sleep.  How can we be sure our memories of things before we woke up actually occurred?  How can we be sure we ever existed at all before we woke up this morning.  How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?\n",

I mean, I immdiately got the reference, and any reading of classic english literature would clue you in pretty quickly. Heck, the references are in shakespeare.\n\nSure, its a pretty abhorent abuse of power, but thats part of the fundamental conceit of the prompt- returning to a time before checks on such power.

I've been here for like, *decades!* Was wondering when you were gonna turn up.\"\n\n\"Well that's just great. I knew it. I **knew** you would do this. You do it every time, Kevin!\"\n\n\"Come on, man. That's not fair.\"\n\nI stared at Kevin, my veins pumping as anger coursed through my body. The last person I'd been expecting to meet here was him: the stealer of my ideas for years, the guy who'd ridden my coat tails to glory whenever he could.\n\n\"Bro, why don't you chill and meet some of my knights. They have like, swords and everything!\" Kevin gave me that goofy grin, but i was having none of it.\n\n\"How about you tell me how you got to my machine without me knowing first, hmm? I had it secured, and no one knew the workings of it. I was the first to use the bloody thing!\" I glared at him, seething.\n\n\"Come on, man. How do you know I didn't find my own way here through my *own* device?\" Kevin shrugged and lobbed a lazy look around the courtyard.\n\n\"How do I know? How do *I KNOW?*\" I was almost shouting at the incredulity of Kevin's response. \"Why don't we start with that science fair in fifth grade where we both 'created' that volcano and you did none of the work, except to tell the teachers it was all your idea? Or what about the time I wanted to date that girl at college, and you were my wingman?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, I nailed that.\"\n\n\"No, you nailed *her*. You told her I had syphilis after I'd spent an hour getting to know her!\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah.\" Kevin gave a chuckle.\n\n\"And then you dated her for six months!\"\n\n\"Sorry about that!\"\n\n\"The whole college called me Syphilis Sid for three years!\"\n\n\"Bro, it was just a prank.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it was,\" I said, my blood boiling. \"And let's not forget what *was* the biggest indignity I've suffered until now, when you stole my ideas around time revolutions and presented them to the science board at Harvard to secure your admission.\"\n\n\"Bruh, I just *based* my presentation on your ideas, I added my own stuff.\" Kevin gave a chuckle and rubbed his nose.\n\n\"All that you added was a new font! You presented my breakthrough theory of time travel in Comic Sans MS! *You're a monster!\"* I screamed, turning heads all around as people looked at me suspiciously.\n\n\"You need to chill, cuz.\" Kevin put his arm around my shoulder. \"Life's too short to get wound up, man. It's like I always say: you get bitter, or you get better.\"\n\n\"*I* always say that!\" I bellowed, moving to throw Kevin's arm from around me.\n\nBut then it happened: a quiet revelation - a feeling born out of solitude. I thought of every night I'd spent alone at college because of Kevin; of the teachers who'd told me off for letting him do all the work in the projects we'd done together. Of the years spent on my own as a disgraced scientist in my lab, creating my device so I could go back and stop Kevin from ruining my life. Every moment we'd been together had been a hellish journey of living in the freezing shadow of his lazy, cunning attitude.\n\nI hated Kevin so much. But now... now I knew what to do.\n\n\"You kept the spare receiver with you, right?\" I whispered, causing Kevin to lean in. I smelt the pickles and ale on his breath.\n\n\"Yeah bruh, round my neck, just like you- I mean, I planned it.\" He pulled at his undershirt, revealing the small receiver that kept him connected to the future.\n\n\"Well, then.\" I leaned in to his ear, a grin pulling at my mouth. \"Here's one more thing I'm doing before you, brother.\"\n\nAnd as I wrenched the necklace from my twin, I heard fear enter his voice for the first time; a scream that grew as I smashed his necklace with my heel, pulled on my own device, and clicked the RETURN button.\n\nAs I was pulled back through time, the echoes of my brother's nightmare reached me. He had stolen so much of my past.\n\nBut I had just sealed his future.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n___________________________________________________________\nIf you enjoyed this, feel free to check out more of my writing [here](http://reddit.com/r/ihlaking)!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Tidied up a couple of typos",

You are a lonely fella that played a little with the magnetic field while nobody was watching?\" \nI stared at him in disbelief, he was spot on. \"Well, funny how easy it is once you get it, isn't it? But what do I tell you... what's your name by the way?\". \"Marc\" I told him. \n\n\"Ok, Marc. Welcome to the medieval ages, I am Chad the Great. You can chose your own name if you like, but 'the Neet', 'the Mighty' and 'the Awesome' are already taken. So, you wanna feast a little at Ian the Neet's castle? They have a great turkey there and we can ride some horses and stuff.\"\nI was still so beriddled that I could barely get a word out but I nodded and he continued talking: \"Great, that's really great, you know. Maybe you can have the land in the east, we will see. So, what have you studied?\" \"Electrical engineering\" I answered. \"Oh, okay. That's a pity, but we'll see. Soo... let me introduce you to the situation. You see, you are not the only one who put this together, actually quite a few people did. And, oh wonder, nobody made it public to all the people and everyone decided to go back and become king... yeah. Soo, to be honest, about 90% of the kings I know are time-travellers. Aand, they all thought you could come back, bummer - you can't- and nobody has put much thought into how they are going to accomplish anything in this time.\" \n\nHe looked at me. I really wanted to come back. Because of my family and that girl I like and ... work ... and... hm... maybe I didn't really want to go back. If I think about it all I ever wanted was to get away from that place, from the people and the- \"Marc, hey, hey, this is the moment where you say: Chad, worry no more, of all the people I have thought of some things that will be useful for this time.\" \"Ehh, no, I haven't, sorry.\" I had to say.\n\n\"Great. We are all as stupid as the next one. Martin the Awesome was the first one, so he is basically the inventor of time-travel, for what it's worth. He just had a smartphone and a lighter with him and nothing else. He told the people that he was from the future and that he was going to bring them electrical light and TV and the internet but... that's quite difficult without electricity and computers and everything. People treated him like a total lunatic. So he just said that he could capture their souls with his smartphone and that he would send them to hell and stuff. Yeah... ehm, and I basically did the same. So at the moment they just give us a part of their food and everything, you know, for free. Plus, we are kings. But we are totally working on a steam engine, like every sunday we get together and work on it, you know, for the people. You must know that this was a rather democratic society before we got here but whatever. We will bring them technological advancement in the end. We have already built a small printing press, which the monks love, and a lightbulb but we don't have electricity, yet... and one king managed to play gangnam style on a floot - people love it.  So... yeah, now you know what's going on.\" \n\n\"Oh\" was all I could say \"that doesn't sound too good.\" Chad the Great was a little embarrassed. \"Yeah, we have this theory, that we might actually be the cause of what we called 'the Dark Ages' back in the future... but you should see for yourself, the parties are amazing, the beer tastes better than back home and every lady falls for a king. You are down to party, right?\" \"Of course I am. Party 4 life\"- I didn't want to argue with my new peer group.\" \"Ok, great. Let's go to the horses.\"\nThen he gave me a horse and we rode to King Ian the Neet's castle, escorted by like a dozen knights. My head was racing, too much to process at once. The party was great, though. ",

            "comment": "\"Be ye wizard or God of old?\"\n\nI stared blankly, looking into the face of a toothless, wizened hag, whose clothes hung off her frame in a ragged, baggy fashion.  She stood with one arm out, placing her thin body between myself and a small toddler barely over the age of three.\n\n\"I,\" I began in a loud, booming voice.  \"Am Merlin, the greatest wizard who ever was, or ever will be.\"\n\n\"Be ye benevolent?\" A younger man chimed in, waving his crudely shaped pitchfork in the air.  He, unlike the crone, seemed eager to meet me, as did his younger sister, who strained to get a look of my unkempt face.  \n\n\"Yes.\" I smiled, pulling a dehydrated food pack from a pocket.  \"You seem hungry.  Come over here, I won't bite.  You have my word.\"\n\nThe man walked over, jittery, as though he'd had a strong cup of coffee.  *\"Maybe I should give the little kids some,\"* I thought jokingly.\n\n\"Do you have water?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Aye,\" the man replied, handing me a wooden bucket.  A layer of algae coated the bucket's insides, home to some sort of insect, which swam in and out of the dense greenery.  I retched slightly, disgusted.  But no matter.  It would suffice.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, grabbing more dehydrated food from my pack.  \"I can conjure enough food to feed this village.  But first, I need some wood and a very large pot.\"\n\n\"Pot?\"  An elderly man wheezed at me, his face a picture of confusion.  \"What dost thou mean by 'pot'?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" I replied smoothly.  \"It's the magic word for cauldron.\"\n\n\"I shall get that!\"  A boy, nearing ten, shouted excitedly next to me.  \"It shall be my first quest.\"\n\n\"Good.\"  As the peasants piled wood, I pulled a lighter from my back pocket, then stuffed it into a nearby stack of wood.  The kindling immediately caught flame, eliciting oohs and aahs from my ever growing crowd of spectators.\n\n\"How didst thou light the flame?  Ye hadst neither flint nor iron!\"\n\n\"Magic,\" I replied, wiggling my lighter.  I clicked it on once more then breathed, sending a plume of flame into the air; I'd drunk a bit of vodka beforehand.  The onlookers flinched back, cowering before my might.\n\n\"Half dragon, he is!\" An old crone shouted into the air.  \"And let it be known that Maggie hadst forecast the future!\"\n\n\"Whoa, I want to be like him when I grow up,\" exclaimed a tiny child.  As the crowd began to chatter, I pulled a small ball of weed from my sleeve, then slipped it into the fire.\n\n*\"They'll thank me later.  Or maybe they'll just go on one heck of a withdrawal.\"*\n\nAs the water neared boiling, I grabbed a ladle from some fat man in the crowd, then began pouring water into each of the packets.  By eyeballing, I assumed the town had about 100 residents.  And each packet had a serving size of three.  *\"Yeah.  I definitely have enough to feed them.  And then some,\"* I thought, eyeing the chubby man who, in turn, stared back, piggy eyes flitting to his ladle.\n\n\"Alright!\" I shouted loudly, having pulled a megaphone from my pack.  The peasants shrunk back, cowed and afraid.  \"Gather into groups of three.  You'll have to share the food, but there'll be more than enough to go around.\"\n\nAs the groups lined up, bowls at the ready, someone shouted \"The king hath come!\"  Peasants began scrambling, hiding their gold.  The fat man ran, his belly rippling violently.\n\n*\"King,\"* I thought, pulling out my pistol.  *\"I'll challenge him to single combat, then take the throne for myself.\"*\n\nAs the king approached, I hesitated.  *\"Wait...is that a WALKING DEAD t-shirt?\"*  The king, in turn, stared at me, his eyes scanning my baggy denim jeans and 420 blaze it sweater.\n\n\"Bro,\" said the king, dismounting, wearing a smile on his face.  \"You discovered time travelling too?!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I replied, grinning ear to ear.\n\n\"So, what'd you tell them your name was?\"\n\n\"Merlin.\"\n\n\"Duuuudeee!\" The king clapped his hands with glee.  \"That's awesome!  To them, I'm Arthur.  But you, my dude, can call me Phil.\"\n\n\"Sweet ride, by the way,\" I said, pointing to Phil's massive dirt bike.\n\n\"Yeah.\"  Phil glanced tenderly at the bike.  \"I just couldn't leave my baby...\"\n\nPhil trailed off, his nose flaring.  He sniffed once.  Twice.\n\n\"Yo, is that...is that weed?\"\n\n\"Yeah man,\" I said grinning.  \"I got some pre-workout to give to the little kids too.\"\n\n\"Shit man, you got anymore?  I haven't been high in forever!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I replied, pulling out a couple of pre-rolled joints.\n\n\"Dude.  Let's get high.\"\n\n***\n\nLiked the story?

How did you do this?\" I asked, completely baffled.\n\n\"Well man, it is just that you left me some of your early notes in the lab, and a year after you were gone, that really peaked my interest. So I tryed to work from that. I got here ten days ago with a few machine guns and took over this little duchy, I am currently rewamping their political system before I want to go on, and I could need your help with that.\" She said.\n\nOne of the men behind her said something in old german I barely understood. \"What... talking?\" Was all I got.\n\nRobin responded. \"I just told him that I'd tell him later what we talk about.\"\n\n\"So, what do you want to archive here? How are you going to rewamp this society?\" I asked, trying to understand what was going on.\n\n\"Well, that is where you come in.\" She told me, focusing on me again. \"I was foolish enough to try to build my time machine so that it could transport a shittonne of stuff, it was as big as a car. Actually, there is the car I arrived in.\" She was pointing toward a hut, smiling. \"Behind that thing.

The people around Robin had taken a few steps back.\n\n\"Protection.\" I said. \"I didn't expect a castle to be right in front of where I landed, after all, there was nothing but forest on the map.\" \n\n\"Yeah, this was a secret fortress, only known to a few messengers, that made it easyer to take over, at least after I had convinced the king not to mess with me.\" She said.\n\n\"So, what stuff do you want?\" I asked. I was going to work with her. I knew that now. \"By the way, If we are going to build citys, not here, try to take over some place that isn't mostly nature.\" \n\n\"For now I need solar power, is this thing big enough to transport Solar panels?\" She asked. \n\nI responded by activating the screen on the side. \n\n\"Dave, can we transport solar panels?\" I asked.\n\n\"You know, we had a scedule, right?\" He responded as my bagpack dropped into the time machine.\n\n\"You can contact our time from here?\" She asked. She walked over in front of the screen. \"Hey Dave!\"\n",

I stood there mouth breathing in front of a scraggly, greyed man of about 50, bewildered at what to do next. Is he going to kill me? Have a feast? How did he get here? \n\nQuickly, before I responded I tried to remember every time traveling paradox and outcome I encountered during my research, but every thread I read on the internet I encountered more and more in-fighting and bizarre rants among the tight knit community. I tried to envision a thousand outcomes, but all I can remember is everything devolving into mom-jokes and Kermit memes. In my head it felt like hours had passed and I had to react for fear of what would happen next, I fumbled in my pocket for my artifact in the event I had to zip \u2122 fast, (Journal note: put in a trade mark for the name zip when time traveling as it feels as if you were a zipper unzipping when you leave and zipping back up when you arrive), and placed my free hand on the lever.\n\n\u201cWait bro, don\u2019t portal out on me now! I have a grave warning for you.\u201d The young kind said.\n\n\u201cPortal? You used portal?\u201d I simply couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nIncredibly excited he shouted out \u201cYeah man, like the video game! Its awesome right?\u201d Meanwhile a pair of handmaidens appeared with a plate of bread, and a jug of what I could only guess was win.\n\nI could feel the anger rising in me and it was muddling my wits, in an effort to buy some time and get some info all I could say was \u201cPortal, bro great game\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt, only problem here is no electricity. I really miss gaming and weed. That\u2019s the shit they don\u2019t tell you\u2026.the things you will miss.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey?\u201d A million questions came to my head.\nThe young king began to laugh uncontrollably \u201cYeah man, they\u2026..this must be your first portal, what an amateur!\u201d\n\nI cut him off, simultaneously taking my hand off of my artifact I began to gesticulate wildly \u201cPLEASE STOP CALLING IT PORTAL! WHO ARE THEY?\u201d\n\n\u201cDude, chill the hell out, have some wine, and you can stop clutching your device I aint going to kill you, it\u2019s against the portalers law.\u201d\n\nI shook my head and tried to regain my emotions \u201cJesus Christ\u2026portalers law?\u201d\n\n\u201cSit down over here at this table, lets have a drink I will tell you all about it, by the way my name is King Solo, but my real name is Carter.\u201d He jumped down from his throne, and walked over to the table with me.\n\n\u201cHere buddy, set your artifact and device on this baller ass gold plate I got encrusted with diamonds. Hey girl, grab the plate of Gondor!\u201d\n\nThis guy has a sense of humor, likes LOTR, maybe this will go well I thought. \u201cSweet name!\u201d I blurted out as I walked over to the table. As I was walking a young, gorgeous blonde girl with hazel eyes began walking over with a dazzlingly bright gold tray, and the other two girls brought the bread and wine over.\n\n\u201cYeah, I know what you are thinking dude. Trust me, any chick is hittable\u2026.but you have to get over the teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah man, no fluoride around here!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026.right.\u201d I exclaimed. I sat down and began to relax my guard, and placed my device and artifact onto the gold tray.\n \nThe young king immediately eyeballed my set up and I began to feel slightly nauseous. \n\n\u201cWow dude you really are dumb\u201d He lunged for both my device and artifact. I tried to beat him to the punch, but felt as if I was in a fever dream, my arms wouldn\u2019t move as fast as my neurons could fire. Simultaneously, a pair of arms grabbed me and stopped all movement. The young king jumped behind the table, eyes wide with delirium he shouted:\n\n\u201cThis has been a long frigging time, enjoy perpetual shits, STD\u2019s, and no electricity. I am getting the fuck out of here.\u201d And in bright flash he was gone.\n\nThe mammoth grip on me immediately relaxed, however I could feel the hot stale breath on the back of my neck. I stepped forward and eventually turned around to see a behemoth staring down at me. He muttered one statement:\n\n\u201cYour majesty.\u201d\n",

            "comment": "They said I was crazy\u2026.. That I\u2019ve watched too many scifi movies\u2026.. A real scientist wouldn\u2019t waist his \u201cTime\u201d in pursuit of the impossible. I didn\u2019t listen to them, I never did. I knew I could figure it out. Knew that if the impossible was possible I was the one to find it. There were times over the years that I thought to myself maybe they were right and it\u2019s just not possible. After so many failed attempts one would start to think that way. Maybe I should stop this nonsense and move on. Maybe there is something better I should be putting my mind to instead of time travel. So I would walk away for a few days but something in the back of my mind would keep nagging at me to continue that there was something I needed to discover, something that was just a bit out of reach that I was getting closer and closer to, and I needed to find it. Here I now stand basking in the glory of my creation. Time travel was possible and I was the one to find it. \r\n\nGrowing up I was always fascinated with King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Why not start there. Take a couple of days and live out a childhood fantasy. Everyone deserves to do that once in a while right. I had been preparing for this day for years now. Taking some time away from my research to hit up some renfairs. They were fun and a nice escape for me. I picked up quite a few different outfits. Joined in with the crowd getting into character, playing along like this was all accurate for the time period. But now the time had come to really experience what that time was like. I had everything I needed. My renfair outfit was perfect. Nothing to high class looking. I wanted to blend in. I didn\u2019t have any aspirations of going back and becoming a king, conquering the world, or anything like that. I just want to look around for a bit. Get the lay of the land so to speak. I had packed a satchel with a few snacks and jerky. Not having any money of the time period was going to be a problem, and I wasn\u2019t really going to stay that long on the first trip anyway. So the snacks will do.\r\n\nI approached the time portal and prepared myself as best I could for what was going to happen once I stepped in. I felt a little apprehensive almost like I had a bad feeling about this, but my calculations were sound and I had come this far. There was a flash of light and the next thing I know I\u2019m zipping through this vortex at incredible speed. It reminds of some old movies my parents showed me. They had watched it with their parents when they were younger as well. I think it was called lightspeed, warpspeed, or something like that. What I see before my eye is fascinating. It\u2019s truly beyond words the best way I can describe it is like being in a kaleidoscope. Colors coalescing into multifaceted shapes and patterns. But even that doesn\u2019t do it justice. The next thing I know there is another flash of light, the portal closes, and I land with a thud on solid ground. \r\n\n\u201cExcellent Dude!\u201d I hear in unison. \"Welcome to the medieval times!\u201d\r\n\nWait\u2026 Excellent Dude\u2026 That\u2019s not what I expected to hear when I arrived. I slowly make my way to my feet and take a look around. Something must have gone wrong. As I pan around I can see a lush forest landscape. I was taken back by the sheer size and majesty of the trees. The morning sunlight was shining through the trees like rays of light. I can see two young men. Probably in their late teens maybe early twentys, suited in armor but without their helms on. One has a sort curly blonde hair. The other one a mopey head of black hair.\r\n\n\u201cHow did you know I was going to be here?\u201d\r\n\n\u201cOh. Our buddy Rufus said we should meet you here.\u201d says the blonde haired one.\r\n\n\u201cYeah, cause like you took a bogus journey and met a most heinous end as you got stuck here because you forgot this\u201d\r\n\nThe black haired one reaches out and hands me my portable portal device. Oh Shit! I quickly reach into my satchel and frantically search it. How could I have been that stupid as to forget this? It\u2019s my only way to get home. I was so lost in the moment of finally discovering time travel that\u2026\u2026 Wait how could this Rufus guy know I forgot my return portal device, and tell these two where to find me?\r\n\n\u201cWho are you?\" \"And who is Rufus?\"\r\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Bill S. Preston Esquire!\u201d\r\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Ted Theodore Logan!\u201d\r\n\n\u201cAnd together we are WYLD STALLYNS\u201d as they both break out into playing Air Guitar.\r\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d\r\n\n\"Rufus is our friend from the future.\" \"He came back in time to help us with our history report.\"\r\"You see our band.\" \"Wyld Stallyns!\" They say in unison, is important to the future.\"\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make this most triumphant video with Eddie Van Halen, but we had to pass our history report first.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cOr my dad was going to ship me out to military school.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cBogus\u201d They say in unison.\n\n\" With Rufus's help I didn't have to go to military school and our band stayed together.\"\n\n\u201cSo how did you get here?\u201d I ask.\r\n\n\u201cWhile we were at the Circle K doing some research for our report, Rufus shows up in his time machine, we meet our future selves, who convinced us we should go with Rufus, and we\u2019ve been on this most excellent journey through time taking historical figures back to San Dimas for our history report.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve meet Napoleon, Billy the Kid, Socrates,a bunch of other notable figures, and the princesses.\u201d\r\n\n\"So we all hoped in the time machine, gave the historical figures a tour of San Dimas, and then totally nailed our history report\u201d\r\n\n\u201cYeah so Rufus shows back up later at my house in the time machine with the princesses and we came back here to get married\u201d\r\n\n\u201cHey, we should be getting back to the princesses Ted.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cOh yeah, catch ya later dude\u201d\r\n\n\u201cCatch ya later Bill and Ted\u201d I reply as they ride off. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is my first time writing a story, but this topic inspired me and I had to write this.

            "comment": "The Time Traveler stood there speechless in front of the bejeweled figure.  He\u2019d been anticipating this very conversation for so long that he\u2019d run through thousands of scenarios in his head.  It had become a ritual for him in his off hours.  While standing in the shower, he\u2019d act both sides of the first conversation, formally introducing himself to the king in the manner he\u2019d tirelessly researched for so many nights.  He could only guess where the conversation would go or what the man\u2019s responses would be.  No doubt he would have to maintain his regal atmosphere in the presence of something that caused absolute and total confusion.  The Time Traveler had brought all sorts of modern-day gadgets to dazzle, impress, and prove his wild story correct.  After playing the part of \u201cwizard\u201d to the common folk, he\u2019d get the king one-on-one to discuss a way to share knowledge and secure a tidy fortune for himself.  The first coherent thought he could piece together after finally getting his long-coveted interview was how jarring it is to build such a sturdy plan only to turn around and realize that you\u2019ve been building in the backyard of an even more elaborate one.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna start catching flies if you keep your mouth open, dude,\u201d said the extravagantly-dressed figurehead in front of him.\n\nThe Time Traveler opened and closed his mouth a few times as he tried to formulate his response, mentally tearing up dozens of possible scripts.\n\n\u201cHow long?\u201d was all that came up.\n\n\u201cHow long did it take to become king?  I was actually pretty surprised with how easy it is.  You\u2019ve got to be a bit ruthless, but there\u2019s a way to do it.\u201d  The Time Traveler could tell that this was the story this man had been wanting to tell since he saw a young man dressed in renaissance fair attire stride into his recently acquired court.  \u201cSee, you have to take advantage of the whole \u201cdivine right\u201d thing.  These people will absolutely follow a good leader over just another guy, but if you can prove that you\u2019ve got the Big Man\u2019s blessing, you\u2019re in.  It just takes some modern tech to get it done.  A light show here, a bit of pyrotechnics there, and some research into historic events got the job done for me.  Between you and I, I actually did get challenged to a duel.  I\u2019m not proud of it, but I had to take him out.\u201d\n\nThe Time Traveler refocused on the conversation at hand.  \u201cYou killed someone?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yeah.  Not in actual combat!  I don\u2019t know any more about sword fighting than you do.\u201d  The Time Traveler pursed his lips as he remembered the four months of medieval sword fighting lessons at the rec center he\u2019d taken in anticipation of just such an occasion.  \u201cRicin, my man.  Just hop back through the time portal and get what you need to fake a little divine judgement.  If you\u2019re the one who found out how to time travel, you know that he would have died anyway.  River of time, man.\u201d\n\nThe Time Traveler\u2019s face relaxed as acceptance finally fell upon him.  \u201cSo, what\u2019s it like?\u201d\n\nThe king\u2019s arm reached out from beneath the heavy cloak and clasped the Time Traveler on the shoulder.  \u201cFollow me, buddy.  I\u2019ve got a lot to show you.\u201d",

Every fibre in my heavy body screamed at me that this time, we just may have made it. \n\nI took a deep breath, the clean air that filled my city lungs caught in my throat, along with the emotional lump that had formed. Willing my fingers to flex and my legs to bend, I slowly pushed myself up to a sitting position. My headache was only a dull throb now. \n\nIt was hard to stand, leaving the clean smell of the dirt behind. My sharp green eyes surveyed the scene in front of me. I realized I was looking down and across a grassy landscape, littered with fluffy white sheep and dotted with a few dairy cows. The view was abruptly capped by a magnificent stone castle, towers touching the cerulean sky. \n\nI could have gotten lost in the wonder of it all. How my time machine had worked and I would never have to go back to the place that never wanted me! I could be king. I would be fair of course! All the new technology and ideals I would teach these medieval  people. As king, no one could tell me I was wrong, I was broken or I was twisted. \n\nI was shaken out of my reverie. Well, the earth shook me out of it. Alerting my senses my heart leaped in my chest. As they got closer the horse hooves thundered in my ears. At least two dozen men, in rawhide armour and tunics, a mule toting behind the beautiful horses carrying what looked like a large boar. So, a hunting party.  Coming from behind me I felt the wind from the motion sweep past me and tickling my buzzcut head. \n\nThe party halted a close distance away, but one man on the most dazzling white stallion I have ever seen kept on towards me. As he got closer I could see the sun glinting off his golden crown. His stereotypically blond cropped hair bounced with the strides of his beast and blue eyes sparkling with curiosity and apprehension the nearer he got to me. \n\nMy heart beat a frantic stattico in my chest. I stood at 5'7\" and 150 pounds soaking wet. When he swung out of the saddle I knew I couldn't beat him in a physical dual. His bulging muscles and at least 6'2\" frame cast a shadow over my trembling form. Aniexty? Excitement? I had no idea. Even his apple iPhone ear buds beat my crappy dollar store brand ones. \n\nWait, ear buds? \n\n\"Hey bro, you alight!?\"\n\nMy head spun but out of sheer reflex I returned his offered fist bump. I couldn't stop the jolt of electricity that hit me the moment we touched. I saw a slight blush brush his sun touched cheeks. We both turned away slightly.\n\nI started, \n\"How did you -\"\n\nHeld up his leather gloves hand,  interrupting me.\n\"Same way you did.\"\n\nHe remounted his horse, paused for a moment, then offered me a hand up. I took it. The leather warmed my hand and I let him help hoist me up on the back if the saddle. He glanced back at me, I was still shaking like a fool. His smile was bright and sincere, something in his eyes captured me. I just knew he felt it too.\n\nI felt safe, for a moment, on that hill with this king from the future, almost felt like home. ",

            "comment": "My first time writing in second person, so I know it's a little bit rough.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nYou step back and admire your work.  Finally, time travel is possible!  And it\u2019s all thanks to you.  Years ago, you had realized everyone was searching in the wrong place for the ability to time travel.  It couldn\u2019t be contained in a machine--it was purely biological!  With the correct combination of chemicals, every atom in a human body, including the atoms of their soul, could be displaced to another place in time and space and reformed with magnetic energy.  It\u2019s that simple!\n\n\nYou shake your head in awe of your own genius.  And to imagine, the first thing you made was a love potion.  You\u2019ve come a long way.\n\n\nOblivious to your admiration, the small vial of chemicals steams in front of you.  The steam is white, but the solution is black, blue, and purple--the color of space.  \n\n\nAnticipation floods through your veins.  The day has come!  You crack your knuckles and adjust your stark white lab coat.  This is it.  The tests worked on guinea pigs and large mammals such as apes.  You even secretly used your nephew as a test subject--thankfully he hasn\u2019t told anyone yet.  He found it very cool to be transported five minutes into the past.\n\n\nIt\u2019s up to you to find out if it works on a fully grown human body.\n\n\nYou had discovered that the amount of one special element determined how far one traveled backwards.  The amount of the chemical in the vial before you should send you back to the Middle Ages.  You sling your pre-packed backpack over your shoulder.  It\u2019s time.\n\n\nYou take a deep breath.  Without time to rethink things, you dump the contents of the no longer steaming vial into your mouth.\n\n\nInstantly, a cold sensation floods your taste buds.  It feels as if you\u2019ve just bitten into ice.  Your hands fly to your jaw, instinctively trying to warm it up, but to no avail.  Your teeth begin to ache with the low temperature.  You scrunch your eyes closed in pain.  It hurts so very badly, you don\u2019t know if you can stand it.  A wave of pain slams into your head and you feel like you might throw up.  \n\n\nJust when you\u2019re about to scream from the intense aches, they depart at once. \n\n Shocked, you pry your hands off your face and peek one eye open.\n\n\nYou\u2019re on the edge of a forest.\n\n\nWarily, you look deep into the woods.  They look normal.  That leaves one thing to do.  \n\n\nEver so slowly, you turn to face the field behind you.\n\n\nYou see a walled city, comfortably plopped in the middle of a valley.  Carts travel on a beaten down dirt road to the city, and you see knights in shining silver armor escorting and checking everyone who enters.\n\n\nYou fist pump excitedly and jump up and down.  You\u2019ve made it!  You\u2019ve gone back in time!\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d  A voice startles you out of your personal celebration.  You turn to see a knight riding up to you on a large brown stallion.  The horse trots to you and leans forward as if to sniff you, but the knight pulls its head backwards with the reigns.  \n\n\n\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d the knight asks.  He has a kind face and appears to be on the older side of middle age.  His breastplate bears an elaborate coat of arms, and each piece of his armor is expertly shined.  He looks to have a high status.\n\n\n\u201cI, uh\u2026\u201d you stutter.  \u201cI--came from the forest.  I\u2019m traveling through these parts to come see your wonderful city.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d  The knight raises an eyebrow.  \u201cTraveling through, eh?  I\u2019ll wager you must be a wizard, then.\u201d  You blink, hoping he hadn\u2019t seen you appear.  \u201cNo normal traveler wears such white clothing,\u201d he continues.  You relax.  \u201cNor does a normal traveler appear out of thin air,\u201d he finishes.  \n\n\nTensing, you try to speak but can\u2019t get the words out.  You hadn\u2019t planned this far ahead.  \n\n\nThe knight winks at you.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry.  Apparently unlike you, I know what to do in this situation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou do?\u201d you ask, confused.\n\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d he affirms.\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome, follow me.\u201d  The knight turns his horse around and begins to trot off.  \u201cI have my orders.  If you don\u2019t follow, you may have trouble on your hands,\u201d he says over his shoulder as he pats his scabbard.\n\n\nYou swallow and run to catch up to the horse.  \u201cSo\u2026have you dealt with people spontaneously appearing before?\u201d you question, genuinely curious as to how the knight will answer.\n\n\n\u201cI have indeed,\u201d the man replies.  \u201cA few years ago.  The man appeared right where you were standing, in fact.  It was an odd day.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d  You feel dejected.  If someone had appeared before you, then that means you weren\u2019t the first to discover time travel.  All that work, and for nothing.\n\n\nSighing, you hoist your backpack higher.\n\n\nThe knight, whose name is Sir Micah, leads you through the city to its center.  The people all clear a path for him, as if he\u2019s important.  You find he is important--he\u2019s the Commanding Knight of the city.  You learn that you\u2019re being taken to the king, who has a particular interest in magic, as Sir Micah calls it.  Everyone stares at you as you pass by, and you duck your head in embarrassment.\n\n\nThe city, you learn, is called Uther.  When you hear the name, you feel something twinge in the back of your mind, as if you remember it.  You shake your head.  Must have been part of an old TV show or something.  Uther is the capital of the moderately sized kingdom of Aertha.\n\n\nSir Micah leads you to the heart of Uther.  In the center is a walled enclosure with some buildings and large towers.  He explains that this is the palace.\n\n\nYou find it pretty impressive.  The outer courtyard of the palace is a bustling hub of servants, soldiers, cooks, and knights.  It\u2019s so incredible, you can\u2019t take your eyes off everything you see.  Sir Micah dismounts and hands the reigns of his horse to a servant.  He leads you up to a large square building, explaining that it holds all the important parts of the palace--the kitchen, bedrooms, ballrooms, and throne room.\n\n\nWe pause when we come to the throne room.  Its large double mahogany doors are shut.  You gaze in wonder at the tapestries and rich trimmings on the walls.  The colors are rich and ornate, and each element of the room scheme is perfectly designed.\n\n\nSir Micah begins to look himself over, dusting the dirt off his armor.  He takes a handkerchief from somewhere and shines his armor.  \u201cBest look your best,\u201d he advises me.  You try your best to clean the stains off your lab coat, but they won\u2019t come off.  You wish you could have changed into something nicer than your t-shirt and pants.\n\n\nSir Micah tells the guard in front of the throne room that you need an audience with the king.  The guard motions to another guard, and both open the doors to the throne room.  The king is seated at the far end of the room, just like you\u2019ve seen in movies.  He more accurately appears to be lounging on his throne, one leg thrown over an armrest and a gold goblet in his hand.  \n\n\nA thick strip of red carpet is extended over the stone floor.  Even more ornate tapestries hang from these walls, and two rows of pillars line the long hallway.  \nYou hang behind Sir Micah, unsure of what to do.  An announcer calls out, \u201cYour Highness, may I present Sir Micah, Commanding Knight of Uther, Advisor to the King, and--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, yes, get on with it!\u201d the king yells.  \u201cCome, Micah!  Who\u2019s your guest?  Oh, I suppose I should have let you finish, my Announcer dude.  Sorry about that!\u201d\n\n\nYou\u2019re puzzled.  Did a *king* just say \u201cdude?\u201d\n\n\nSir Micah walks toward the king, beckoning for you to follow.  \u201cSire, remember that order you gave me when you became king?  The special one?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d  The king leans forward in his throne, interest written on his features.  His eyes dart to you, and suddenly widen.  Hopping off his throne, he dashes up to you.  \n\n\nYou step back, a little scared.\n\n\nThe king sticks out his fist in front of you.  \u201cBro, you discovered time travel too?\u201d\n\n\nYou blink.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you ask.\n\n\n\u201cFist bump!\u201d  The king smiles encouragingly.\n\n\nYou slowly extend your fist and bump his.\n\n\n\u201cSo how\u2019d you get here?\u201d you ask uncertainly.\n\n\n\u201cDefinitely not a machine.\u201d  The king winks.  \u201cMy dad taught me that well enough.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour dad?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.  You.\u201d\n\n\nYou blink again.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\n\nThe king laughs at your baffled expression.  He explains the confusing situation to you, to Sir Micah\u2019s amusement.  \n\n\nIn the future, you will stay in Uther and become a successful nobleman.  After a few years, you will travel to your original time and have a son.  You will send him back to the Middle Ages, and he will live in that time.  From the king's perspective, he became king several years ago.\n\n\nBefore your son left for the Middle Ages, the future you directed him to watch for you to come and time travel for the first time.\n\n\nYour head spins.\n\n\nSir Micah and your son the king chuckle at your befuddlement.\n\n\nYou finally stop trying to understand it and shake your head to clear it.  \u201cSo\u2026if you\u2019re the king\u2026can you hook me up with some food?\u201d\n\n\nYour son throws his arm around your shoulder and laughs.  \u201cAnnouncer dude!\u201d he yells.  \u201cTell the cook we have a special guest!\u201d\n\n&gt;\n&gt;",

            "comment": "\"Wait what? How dafuq did you get here?\"\n\"Long story, lemme show you around.\"\nI see his palace, his rooms (he even offers me one); but one thought annoyed the hell outta me: This King looks drunk all the time, how did he become the King? I meet a minister and uncontrollably ask him \"How the hell did this guy become the King?\"\n\"What doth thee cullionly?\", he asks.\n\"Oh boy, this is gonna be harder than I thought.\"\n\nI go to the King again, and ask \"How do you communicate with these people?\"\n\"Communi-what?\"\n\"Talk. How do you talk to these people?\"\n\"Bro, I am a spotboy at one of Shake-peer's plays.\"\n\"Shakespeare\"\n\"You want me to shake us a beer? They don't have those here.\"\n\"Boy, this is gonna be way harder than I thought.\"\nSince I can't take more of this dumb shit anymore, I run back to my time machine to go back to the future. As I approach it, I see two guards playing with it. I try to stop them, but one of them manages to activate it, and I see it disappearing before my eyes. For a moment I thought I was screwed, until it hit me; I mean, the second hits me with his spear, and takes me back to the King.\n\nI wake up in the King's chamber.\n\"It's a good thing I saw you, they were gonna kill you. Here, have a drink.\"\n\"Thanks, I guess. Now tell me. How did you get here?\"\n\"What do I tell you. Around 5 years ago, I was high on weed man. I was in the basement of the theatre I work at, when I heard some beeps through the wall. I broke the wall and found this cubicle and went into that and poof I come here. These guys saw my smartphone and thought it was some killing machine. I still mention it to scare them although its battery drained years ago.\"\n\"Wow! And where must I find this cubicle?\"\nThe King takes me to his basement, where he shows me the time machine and guess what - it was the same time machine I had constructed. I gladly hop into it and go back to the future, only to find out it the future has been ruined. I need to prevent the drunk dude from becoming the King. The best way I can think of, is to stop myself from creating a time machine.\n\nI go to my house, only to get the shock of my life (at least the life of this timeline) - I am no longer a scientist, I am a stoned guy who works at a Shakespearean play as a spotboy. Now since all of you have figured out what exactly has happened, I decide to end this mindless loop - by killing myself. I grab a knife and about to stab myself, when suddenly, a third version of me appears and shoots both of us with a gun.",

At the end of the story, it is revealed that these two kings were in fact significant rulers in ancient history who had a bitter rivalry, such as king arthur or julius caesar.",

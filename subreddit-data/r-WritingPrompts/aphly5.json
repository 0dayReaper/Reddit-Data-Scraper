            "comment": "I felt at my chest, feeling the ceremonial knife slipping between my ribs, piercing my heart. For a moment I could feel my heart pumping blood even with the knife lodged firmly within it. A warm sensation spread from my wound throughout my body. \"I dedicate my life to Satan, may my eternal soul serve him forever more in the unholy pits of the Hells.\" Thoughts of fire and brimstone warmed my mind as I slipped away into death...\n\nI blinked open my eyes, I was standing somewhere pleasantly warm and smelled slightly of fireworks. I was so taken by shock that for a long moment I failed to really absorb my surroundings. I was standing in front of a wrought iron gate, it was somewhat unimpressive, standing only chest high. Above the gate hung the words: 'Abandon a bit of hope but not too much hope ye who enter here.' I frowned, if I was where I thought I was, something didn't add up. \n\nIn a bit of a daze, I pushed open the gate and walked along the cobbled road leading to 'The River Styx'. At least that seemed to be consistent with what I had learned. To my chagrin, I walked up to the titular river. The water was crystal clear for one thing, and it was barely larger than fifteen feet across, moreover, it looked to be no more than six feet deep at its deepest. On the river sat a slightly bobbing paddle boat with a young woman at the main seat. \n\n\"So, are you Charon?\" I hedged. \n\nShe replied in a cheerful high pitched voice, \"Nope, that would be my brother. He works in a different place,\" she giggled, \"My name is Sharon.\" \n\nI sat down in the seat beside her, \"Wait, what 'other' place is this then?\" \n\n\"Oh, this is Heck. Essentially it's for folks who didn't quite rate Hell, and didn't manage to squeeze into purgatory.\" \n\n\"Oh ship,\" I paused, going over what I had said, \"Wait, did I say ship? I wanted to say ship.\" \n\nShe giggled in a trill of infuriating humor, \"Oh, we're not allowed to swear here. This is Heck after all silly.\" \n\n\"Son of a witch,\" I tried to swear.\n\nShe laughed again, I swore to kill the witch if she laughed....What did I just think? I would stab the punt....Shuck? Pass? Swat? \n\nI pulled at my hair, now firmly in the grips of an existential crisis. \"Let me get this straight, I can't even *think* bad words here?\"\n\nShe giggled that infuriating giggle again, I longed to strangle her, but I couldn't seem to move my arm to actually do the deed. \"Of course not silly! This is Heck! You should have gone to Hell if you wanted to swear.\" \n\nI placed my head in my lap, clutching my head. I heard music on the air, I whipped my head up and asked, \"What is that sound? I think I recognize that song.\" \n\nShe nodded vigorously, \"That's Mr. Roboto, by Styx. We named the river after them, the boss is a big fan.\"\n\nI shook my head, \"At least your boss has a decent taste in music,\" I realized that we should have been across the pitiful excuse for a river ages ago and paid attention to our progress. We were making large, lazy circles in the river, going nowhere. \n\nI looked at Sharon, staring death at her, \"Why the shuck are we going in circles?\" \n\nShe giggled, \"You're not paddling silly! I would have told you, but you seemed to be enjoying the chance to talk!\" \n\nI wringed my hands, and tried to stop imagining my hands around her neck. Grumbling, I began to paddle, the boat evened out its course and swiftly made it to the other side of the river. As I stood to exit the boat, Sharon waved and said, \"Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto,\" in perfect time with the song. \n\nI tried to flip her off, but managed only to give her a friendly wave. I nearly screamed in impotent fury. \n\nI needed to get the heck out of here. \n\nI walked along the friendly looking path, following signs for 'Circle of the Danged'. I came to the gateway which seemed to be made from old minivan parts and suit ties. A woman in a paisley dress walked out to greet me, her hair in curlers and a shoe held threateningly in her right hand.\n\n\"What the heck is this?\" I winced at the censored word. Why was hell censored? I've been able to think and say it the entire time....Ah, because before I was just using it as a place, not a swear. I suppose this place obeys pre-teen edgy logic on swearing. \n\nI was surprised to receive a swat on my rump from the haggard looking woman. \"What the shuck lady?\" I was answered by another swat on my tuchus. \n\n\"Don't you try and use that kind of language around me young man! I'll paddle your behind!\" she said sternly, waving the shoe menacingly in front of her. \n\n\"Sorry ma'am,\" I surprised myself by saying. \n\nShe looked slightly mollified, \"Now go clean your room mister. It's atrocious in there.\" \n\n\"Wait, what level of Heck is this?\" I asked, confused. \n\n\"This is talking back to your parents, now don't make me tell you twice.\" \n\n\"I know,\" I muttered, \"I'll go clean my room.\" \n\nI found myself in my old seven year old self's bedroom, and looking around at the room from a significantly reduced height.  \n\n\"Ship,\" I said, my voice two octaves higher than I was used to. \n \n\n\n\n________________________\n/r/SirLemoncakes I'm going to make this a mini-series. Probably in eight or nine parts, I'll have a part 2 up soon. Look up what Proverbs 30:17 has to say about this particular sin. ;)",

He made a mental note to never lend his crap to Raphael the day before he went to play guardian angel to a Colombian drug lord. Who knows where in South America the idiot was at this point.\n\nThe demon shrugged, \"Sorry sir, says here that you're Michael Gingrich. You've recently suffered from a fatal heart-attack. Terribly sorry bout all that sir. Not to worry though, the shock will wear off soon.\"\n\nMicheal sighed and tried again. \"Ok look, I see that you're expecting a Michael, but I'm not your guy. I'm *the* Michael. I've misplaced my badge but you've gotta know who I am. Archangel Michael? Gatekeeper to heaven?\n\nThe demon nodded furiously with no indication of belief.\n\n\"C'mon this has to be ringing a bell. We've gotten some cutbacks in the Heaven recently so we're surveying other afterlives to see what's working and what's not. It's actually quite humbling, have you ever visited Valhalla? Christ it's amazing, I'd love to work there if only Odin wasn't such a tyrant. They don't get dental! Although our plan isn't great. I'll tell you what, one of these days I'm gonna talk to Satan about forming some kind of unio...\"\n\nMichael\u2019s rant was rudely interrupted by the floor collapsing, and Michael found himself sliding down a spiraling purple slide. He grabbed onto the side to slow himself only to discover it was covered in what felt like lube. Seeing as his powers were suspended in Hell, he gave up trying and hoped the slide let off into something besides hellfire. This day was really starting to get to him.\n\nTen minutes and a chapped ass later, Michael\u2019s ride ended abruptly in a blow up ball pit. He'd spent a good portion of his ride imagining better ways to discipline the demon that did this to him. Other than stationing him in hell of course.\n\nHe doggy paddled through the balls to the edge to take a good look around. His stomach sank. The atmosphere certainly felt hellish, flames erupted from crevices all around and a red glow faded into darkness in the distance. It was hot too, but comfortably so, not like a Florida summer. Something felt off as he clambered out of the ball pit onto spongy ground.\n\n\"What the hell...\" Michael intoned. He was walking on padded surface that resembled gym mats. Crudely painted gym mats that were dark red except where the paint was cracked and baby blue crept through. He walked over to a pit of fire that was in fact, a pit of see-through plastic flames kept afloat by poorly hid fans with red neon lights running around the base. He ran over to a towering rock wall only to discover it was what could only be described as papier-mache. \"What kind of hell is this?\"\n\nWelcome to Heck Mr. Gingrich.\" The demon was back.\n\n\"You! I am going to have a talk with Satan, he and I go way back, he won't stand for this.\"\n\nThe demon smiled, \"Unfortunately, Satan has no jurisdiction in Heck. Was your ride comfortable Michael? Do you mind if I call you Mike?\"\n\nMicheal's brow furrowed. He ignored the question. \"So this obviously isn't Hell, so what in the hell is Heck?\"\n\nThe demon continued to smile and batted his eyes a few times. \"Well. Since you asked Mike, Heck is the afterlife where you go when your sins are unremarkable, and your virtues few and far between. So I'd say you\u2019ll fit right in!\"\n\nMichael was trying his best to remember that he was an archangel, and that God looks down on assault. Even assault on a demon.\n\nMichael growled, \"Where, demon, is the exit?\"\n\nThe demon flourished his hands, and a booming voice proclaimed, \"To exit Michael, you must first stand trial for the seven unremarkable and ultimately forgivable sins.\"\n\nMichael stood speechless for a minute. Then two minutes. His fists were clenched and bone white. Finally he spoke, \u201cSo demon tell me. What are these seven sins?\u201d\n\nThe demon replied, \u201cWell, there\u2019s flaking, that one\u2019s bad. I can tell you do that a lot. Then there\u2019s chewing loudly, not bathing often enough, masturbating before marriage, offering bad advice, and any and all forms of tailgating.\u201d \n\nMichael leaned against the ball pit. \u201cThat\u2019s six. You said I needed to stand trial for seven.\u201d\n\nThe demon squealed, \u201cOh I forgot, the seventh is forgetfulness.\u201d He grinned ear to ear and started to dance around. \n\nMichael shrugged. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll admit guilt to all of those. Except the masturbating, God is really a stickler about that one.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d The demon waved his hands again and seven hula hoops appeared on the ground. \u201cNow jump Michael. Jump through my hoops.\u201d\n\nMichael couldn\u2019t believe he was performing the demon\u2019s request. He jumped, one through seven, in and out of the hoops. \n\nThe demon, satisfied, then snapped his fingers, and Michael passed out. When he awoke he found God staring down at him. \u201cHow was it?\u201d God asked.\n\n\u201cWell. It was a hell of a lot better than Hell, but I would sure as heck say Hell could learn a lot from Heck.\u201d\n\nGod looked away and sighed. \u201cJesus fucking Christ.\u201d",

I know\" He grabbed my luggage and tossed it into the gondola with little struggle.   \n\n\"You must be...,\"  \n\n\"Procrastination,\" he cut me off. \"I am the sin of procrastination.\"  We were now firmly set in. I had to give him credit for his speedy packing skills. He gave a firm push and we went cruising down River Zit.    \n\n\"Are there many people here?\" I asked.     \n\n\"Most aren't well known the big shots either make it to hell or heaven but there is the winner of a state pie-eating contest. The good news is that there's no fire and brimstone you only get an annoying tan.\"    \n\nWe sailed for an hour before arriving at our destination. At the port, I waited for only five minutes before I got the feeling I was being watched. I had to coax the tiny woman to come out and talk to me.  \n\n\"Oh hey, I'm Janet the sin of shyness she said,\" Her cheeks turned crimson red as she said this.\"Anaja the giant should be here, but he's so terrified of strangers. Hold on I'll go look for him.\"  \n\n\"Will you be long?\" \n\n\"I don't know...maybe,\" she giggled foolishly as she ran away. By the time she was back with Anaja the sun was overhead and I was getting a slight tan.  \n\n\"Still better than brimstone,\" I told myself.  Anaja had to be practically held by hand. He fumbled foolishly with my luggage and at one point buried his head in his hands when I asked him some questions.  \n\nBy the time we got to the next destination, I was mildly annoyed with the pair. Fortunately, I found the next man waiting at the location. He was in a sharp tuxedo glancing at a chain watch.  \n\n\"You must be Martin,\" he started as he gave me a firm handshake. \n\n\"Yes I am,\" I replied with joy at the change in pace. Was he really a sin?  \n\n\"I'm  Mimon, you know I admire the way you placed your luggage. Good work Anaja but you know it's supposed to exactly 30cm from the right foot of the new arrival.\"  \n\n\"Oops,\" Anaja was burying his face in his hands once more.    \n\n\"Do you think we could do this once more?\"    \n\n\"But time, you know.\"  \n\n\"Now now, there's no point in doing something if you're not going to do it right, once again please.\"  \n\nWe walked back 100 steps and walked up to Mimon once more, going through all the pleasantries.    \n   \n\"That was great but with a bit more force in the handshake.\" he said, \"once more.\"    \n\n\"C'mon Mimon, that was pretty damn good,\" Janet protested.  \n\nMimon threw her a dirty look and she started to giggle once more. \"Never mind we'll do it again.\"  \n\nWe marched 100 paces back and walked up to him ensuring that everything was just as he asked.    \n\n\"I guess it'll have to do,\" he said in disappointment.  \n\n\"Oh my God you're such a perfectionist!\" I yelled at him.  \n\n\"Yes, I am. I'm Mimon the Forgivable sin of perfectionism. Now you were doing really well but you had to bring up God and he's not here today. If you could please go back 100 steps and we try it again.\"   \n     \n***\nThe travels will continue over at /r/calicocreations",

            "comment": "Creeping darkness drowned it all out. The piercing sirens, the shouting shouting, the pulsing beat of helicopters above, the smell of fire and gasoline, and the pain. The ache of bones that had spent the last 27 days on a violent, murderous rampage, the fiery holes of flesh ripped open by gunfire, and the sickening desire to hurt others was all swallowed whole by nothing but black. No sight, no sound, no feeling. Like falling face first into a pool of crude oil. Nothing to experience but brief relief.\n\nThen grey. \n\nLike waking from a daydream, suddenly my focus sharpened on where I was. I wasn't surrounded by the noise and lights of armed police demanding my surrender, I wasn't holding an empty jerry can in one hands and a pistol in the other, and there wasn't the burning heat of a church ablaze behind me. I was in a world of grey. Drab, dreary grey. Not peaceful but not chaotic either. Even the air felt stale and bored. \n\n\"Welcome to Heck, my friend.\"\n\nTurning to face the voice that had greeted me, I was met by a spindly man of mild features who looked, and dressed, like a small town accountant. I hated him. \n\n\"I'm sure you have many questions but if you'll let me complete this introduction without interruption, we'll likely get through this relatively quickly.\"\n\nBefore I could even attempt to speak, the Accountant pressed on ahead. \n\n\"Welcome to your new home for the foreseeable future. Heck is a spiritual place, like Heaven, Hell and Purgatory, however you have been neither very good, very bad, nor have you done anything to warrant needing purging of your previous sins so that you may enjoy the eternal paradise of God's Kingdom.\"\n\nAs he spoke, I noticed that the Accountant spent very little time focusing on me, and more on simply recalling the very speech he was giving in a monotonous manner that was quick enough that he was saving time, but slow enough that he shouldn't have to repeat himself. His suit was grey, shirt was checked-grey, though his hair was jet black and slicked back. His eyes flicked across my face to ensure I was still listening, then continued.\n\n\"You have, however, been of some level of naughtiness that has meant you're not likely to be saved, but you may be spared eternal damnation in the fires of Hell. Thus, Heck is a place by which if you suffer the moderate but constant inconveniences that exist within it, you get to stay here in perpetual frustration. Still, it's supposedly better than suffering for all time.\" \n\nWith a gesture to the space behind him, a grey door appeared from thin air - closed. \n\n\"Through this door you will find the first of a possible 7 Circles of Heck, all of which present 7 Forgivable Sins that, if you fail to be humble in their presence, you will be forced closer to the centre. The centre holds the gateway to Hell, where you will be sent should you make it that far.\"\n\nA second gesture and a map sparked in their from nothing. It was a city of sorts, built in a circle with high walls that separated an outer ring from the next one inwards. The map floated in front of me as I read out the names of what could be districts, named after the supposed 7 Forgivable Sins the Accountant had just mentioned; Indifference, Impatience, Inconsideration, Inflexibility, Inconsistency, Insubordinate, and Incorrigible. I'd done much worse. \n\nThen, for the first time, the confusion dawned on me. Why was I here? It seemed very clear now that there is both a Heaven and a Hell, that God and the Devil do exist, and (by all accounts of my last 27 hours) there should really be no dispute between which of those two I should be meeting in my death. I threw the Accountant a puzzled look and asked the only obvious question:\n\n\"Are you sure I'm meant to be here?\"\n\nHis indifference shook and he looked confused himself. \n\n\"Am I.. sure? I.. well, to be quite honest, I don't know. I don't decides who goes where. I exist as this place exists. My purpose is to welcome you here and send you on your way. If you are here, however, it would be safe for both of us to assume that you are here because you are meant to be.\" \n\nThe unquestioning attitude of the Accountant annoyed me. In fact, it infuriated me in the way you ask someone a question that they should know the answer to, yet their response is simply to state \"It is what it is.\" This either meant the he knew a lot less about this place he exists as part of, or that he knew nothing about me, my life, and what brought me here. \n\n\"I'm not supposed to be here.\" I said firmly, watching as the scandal in the Accountants face rose. \n\n\"Of course you are. You're here, not in Heaven, not Hell and not Purgatory. You are in Heck. If you weren't supposed to be here, you'd be elsewhere - get it?\"\n\nLike a snake, I reached out and cut the Accountant's voice off with a tight grip around his throat. His grey eyes bulged wide as he truly seemed to see me for the first time. His frail, thin fingers scraped at my hands and forearm, and his legs thrashed as I lifted his entire body off of the grey dirt in which he stood. His gagging and gasping filled the grey space around us as I pulled his face closer to mine. The rage I thought I'd released when the black of death had taken over burst forth like water from broken floodgates, and I seethed with anger as I spoke.\n\n\"If this is a place for dead people, then you and everyone in it can die again for all I care.\"\n\n\"But.. but..\" the Accountant fought hard to speak through the crushing of his windpipe. \"This.. not a place.. for murderers.. unforgivable sins..\"\n\nI was incensed. I thought death would free me from the blind sheep holding unquestionable faith in some false God. I hated everything about Him on Earth yet, to find out that he'd plague me in the afterlife was worse. I would have to suffer His true existence for all eternity, stuck in a place of grey annoyance, forced to suck it up like a grateful dog that should be happy it's not Hell. Well, fuck Him. \n\n\"Then, if you should find yourself in Gods presence when you next open your eyes, tell Him to expect the dead guarding the next 7 Circles of Heck. I've already sent him dozens of burned churches full of believers from Earth. Tell him he's only going to get busier.\" \n\nEven the Accountant's last gasp was mediocre. As his body slumped to the floor, it slipped into a cloud of grey smoke and disappeared completely. I stared at the door ahead of me, unsure what to expect. The handle turned easily and the door seemed eager to usher me through to the next Circle of Heck, and as I stepped through the doorway my anger and frustration grew with what met me...",

With God not knowing what to do with him, he was supposed to be sent to Hell. However, with God's initial indecisiveness, Jason was sent to Heck, or Land of the Heckas. This is where those who are extremely average are sent but tow below that Heaven line where they don't do enough to be in God's good graces. \n\nAs Jason arrives, he has to walk through Door 1: Social Media. There, he sees the countless Facebook and Twitter posts he makes, such as his mundane activities of going for a walk and then Instagramming his walks. \n\nHe then reaches Door 2: Netflix. He sees his recording of The Bachelor season finale. Nothing else needs to be said with this. \n\nWhen he reaches Door 3, he sees all the food he threw away as a kid, mainly the brussel sprouts and asparagus he said he loved to his mother. \n\nDoor 4 is a bit different, as it is just a bubble of awkwardness. A memory kicks back to when he was in high school. At a school dance, he said his date's dress made her look wider than usual. \n\nWhen reaching Door 5, he sees continuous reruns of Friends. Jason wants to stay here, but the Spanish dubbing irritates him. \n\nDoor 6 is an unused gym membership. He bought the discounted purchase at Costco, thinking he got a deal. But the fact he never goes, it just added to his long list of wasteful purchases. \n\nFinally at Door 7, it is a memory of saying he wished he was never born. The turkey was too dry one Thanksgiving holiday. While he still ate it, along with the mashed potatoes and stuffing, he did not say thank you to his mother, who slaved all day at the meal. After finishing the meal, Jason still complained, saying \"This family sucks. Why did I have to be born here.\" \n\nWhen Jason realizes all the things he had done wrong, there was no turning back, as there was no escaping the Land of the Heckas. ",

They clung to me like death. \n\n\"Hello!\" a shrill voice rang out, \"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"No\" I replied, accepting my fate, dismal as usual. \n\n\"I asked, how may I help you?!\" She screeched again. \"No manners, they send me, no manners\" her screeches had degraded to near squawks at this point. \n\n\"Oh right!\" I exclaimed, \"No, thank you\" \n\nBut... that... well, seem to set her off. \n\nA giant shadow began to loom over me, wings of an eagle seem to engulf me.

But as my blindness faded so did my fear.\n\nLo and behold the Cat-cardinal. A rather fluffy creature that can only be described as a G rated Griffin. \n\nShe stood up menacingly on furry toe-beans of fury, her head majestically glimmering red in the fire. \n\nI couldn't contain my laughter of relief. \n\nThis did not help my case, you see, for I seemed to had ruffled her feathers even more.\n\n\"And who are you?\" She asked, in the best roar she could muster, a mix between a peep, squeak, and a mew. Her puffed up chest gleaming brightly in the flickering light.  \n\n\"No one comes here\"\n\nI giggled a bit, I admit, but it was quite a sight to see. Until reality hit. \n\nI was no one. \n\n",

            "comment": "Something was off about the afterlife, for one thing the sign above the gate read \u201cAww shucks.\u201d, a phrase he was certain had not been in any religious text. Ever.\nBut he\u2019d never been one for sitting around and waiting for things to come to him, so he patted down his clothes, he recognised the ill fitting suit, it was the only one he owned after all. Patting down his pockets he was a bit miffed to find out that all they had given him to take to the afterlife was two dollars in small change, a lighter and some lint. Grumbling he pressed on, through the gates of heck and into lands not often seen by the eyes of man. The small road ran through a landscape that could not exactly be called \u201cMenacing\u201d or even \u201cVaguely threatening\u201d, it could at best be described as maliciously uninteresting. The small hills did not have any torture pits, but then again, the skies weren\u2019t filled with clouds and cherubs. For a moment he wondered if he was in purgatory, but the place was obviously made with a purpose, it had brick paths leading through the landscape and here and there something that could have been a torture device, although what sort of sin warranted the use of something called a Mechanical stern-talker-to, whatever that was supposed to mean.\nHe had been examining it when the creature walked up to him. It looked like what you\u2019d imagine a demon to look like, if you thought that demons were short balding men wearing a knitted jumper that happened to have red skin and two bumps on the forehead that could only be called horns by the most generous of narrators. The demon greeted the man and extended a hand \u201cHow\u2019d you end up here then? I thought they stopped shipping them down here now that the big man\u2019s decided to let everyone in to the penthouse.\u201d The man looked incredulously at the proffered hand, and the demon attached to it. \u201cWhere the fuck am I?\u201d The demon recoiled slightly, pulling back his hand and taking a step back, \u201cOh my, that\u2019s going to cost you\u201d it said, pulling out a small jar.\nThe man managed to look even more incredulous, which was hard, as the appearance of a demon wearing plaid had set the bar quite high. \u201cDo you take dollars?\u201d he managed to ask, taking the change from his pockets, \u201c50 cents american.\u201d the demon said as he dropped a few coins into the jar. \u201cSo, where am i then?\u201d The demon gave an embarrassed smile, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve gone to heck\u2026\u201d \u201cHell you mean?\u201d, The jar came up again, \u201cNo, not hell,\u201d a small copper coin with a square hole was dropped into the jar, \u201cHeck is like the other palace, but it\u2019s not for the real bad people, or was i suppose. You see, when  you\u2019re evil and you commit a couple deadly sins they sent you to the other place, which is all fire and brimstone and lots of poking with pitchforks.\u201d As they talked they had begun walking along the road, \u201cAnd of course if you were a good guy all around, you get to go the penthouse. But if you were, so to say, a bit of a dick.\u201d Another coin, \u201cYou got sent to heck, were you were mildly tortured and had to atone for committing any of the 7 forgivable sins.\u201d They neared another gate, this one was slightly more menacing that the first one, but still not anything that could be called threatening.\nIt read \u201cImpatience\u201d The man had to concede that patience had not been one of his virtues in life, he\u2019d cut in line once or twice, maybe pushed an old lady once.\n\nOkay, twice.\n\n\n\nSo he strode into the first circle of Heck, once through the gate he found himself not in the plains that had been visible through the gate, but in a waiting room of average size, a large digital counter hung over a door, with a box next to it that appeared to have some paper hanging out it. The plaque above it read \u201cPlease take a number and wait to be called.\u201d And so he did.\n\nTime passed, the number on the board ticked down, one by one. The time between seemed to vary, but in the end it reached the number on the ticket, the PA came on to call his number  and the door\u2019s lock clicked.\nHe got up, opened it and walked into the office, where he was greeted once more by the demon. It handed him a small paper, on it written in delicate, neat handwriting it proclaimed \u201cI, [your name here], have been awarded one (1) forgiveness for the sin of impatience.\u201d He took it and turned to leave, only to find himself once more between the gently curving landscape of Heck, another gate loomed above him, it read \u201cFoul language and improper behaviour in good company.\u201d\nThis too, was a just judgement, and a sin he had committed often enough.\nHe stepped through the gate and the scenery was changed again.\n\nThis time it was some sort of workshop, on the table a large cardboard box was set, inside were wooden planks, screws and the instructions on how to built a F\u00f6rlatelse cabinet. He sat down and got to work.\nThis was of course easier said than done, for starters there were at once too many screws and not enough of them. The allen keys seemed to slip out at every possible opportunity and the instructions changed every time he looked away from them for so much as a second. The cabinet came together slowly, but surely. He screwed in the phillips head screws with his flathead screwdriver because it was somehow the only one that fit, he sorted the screws by size despite their apparent insistentence to get wider, shorter or even disappear entirely when he tried to put them in.\nEventually through gritted teeth he managed to put the cabinet together, it looked quite sturdy, and he felt a slight twinge of pride for enduring the nightmare that had been the assembly of this friggin cabinet.\nAs he put down his screwdriver it promptly collapsed.\nThe words were already in his mouth, mere seconds away from being sent out into this world, before he caught himself. His jaw slammed shut, his lungs expanded as the words were sucked back inside and he held his breath for a few moments.\nThe workshop faded into the familiar landscape of Heck once more.\n\nThe next four circles of heck people who wear mixed fabrics, petty theft, eating the last slice of pizza and general lack of politeness had of course been challenges, but he\u2019d faced them down and come out a better person for it.\nNow he stood before the last gate, the seventh circle of heck, last challenge before he\u2019d be allowed into the penthouse.\nThis gate was even less ominous than the ones that had preceded it. But he had survived six challenges, which were not that hard to begin with, so without so much as reading it\u2019s name, he strode into the seventh circle/\n\nBehind him, the gate labeled overconfidence swung shut.\n",

I don't mean to be accusatory, i'm just tired, yes,  i think i understand now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if you learned the lessons, and changed, tell me what you learned, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow not to be a complete toolbag? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes! Good, Definitely part of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTell me about the trip\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, the first thing i remember was the smell, like old fart soaked couches, and sour beer, BO, and just a little bit of vomit in the background. The room I woke up in was an old trailer with nicotine stained paint, old stained carpet and a chair that im pretty sure i accidentally pissed on at my first kegger. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaha yes they do like to put in little details \n\nWhy do you think you woke up there? \n\n \n\nI waited in that room for a long time, i had a long time to think about it, there weren't any doors, and the walls didn't feel like trailer walls, they felt like mountains like a ten foot thick wall.  It felt like a very personalized cell\n\nAfter a while I sat down, when i sat down i thought about stuff, about myself, about why this and why here. i realized the smell was very familiar, I almost felt at home in that smell, and that grossed me out. You know how when you walk into a house for the first time, and it smells weird at first, and then it goes away. This smell just lingered, And i realized it was my smell, the smell that my house has, the smell that other people crinkle their  nose at when they first meet me. the smell of all the trash, and uncleaned mess, and all the filth that i let accumulate, all the stale beer, in old beer cans, all the trash i let pile up and leave bagged for hours before finally taking it to the dumpster, all the dishes i never cleaned, all the toilets i never flushed. all the bathrooms i never sanitized, all the laundry that was perpetually piled up throughout my dingy life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaha, how long did it take you to figure that out? how long do you think it took you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHmm i guess maybe a few hours? Does that sound right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's the funny thing about that stage, it's kind of a timeless hole, and most people are still pretty disoriented that it takes a while. For some people we eventually send in a guide to help ease the process along, but for a lot of people that just makes the process longer. Let's see you were there for.....4 continuous unsleeping days. 16 hours and 43 minutes you walked around the room approximately 257 times, you poked the walls 42 times, and you went huh 152 times. I love these statistics. Do you want to know how many times you asked, \"what the fuck is up with this shit?\" The answer will surprise you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo that's that's ok. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you figured out the smell, then what?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell as soon as I realized it, i was even more grossed out, and honestly kind of embarrassed. Not long after that, a door kind of appeared. i opened it. Outside was overcast and smoggy, that kind of headachey light, that seems like the whole outside is lit by fluorescents, it was a garbage dump, with mountains of trash and filth, and there was a dude in a dingy white collared shirt standing in a little kiosk.  So I walked up to him and asked him what the deal was. He was kind of an asshole. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYa that's kevin, newcomers need a bit of pushback, if we put a pushover in there, most people would walk all over them, not listen to a damn thing and then never understand what was going on. No apologies here, assholes need assholes to get through to them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYa well sometimes a lighter touch is nice to. \n\nanyways, i asked him what the deal was\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The deal is bucko you're in Heck, it's not hell but it's a hop skip and a jump till you're at the old burn and poke, blood and fire, what you do affects where you go next, achieve self awareness of your own shitbaggery, and believe me you were a shitbag, and if you can change your shitbaggy nature then maybe, just maybe you'll find the elevator out of this fuckin dump. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you an angel? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe? Hell no, I'm a shitbag like you, im just further on the journey.  Further through the doors if you know what I mean.  I'm pretty sure im at this helpdesk because i was an asshole to every customer service person i ever met, I mean a raging out of control asshole, and let me tell you, i have been paying for it here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuh, I always thought people like that went straight to hell, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell i didn't start at the first level of heck that's for sure, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow many levels are there?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNear as i can guess, like, 27, but it's not a simple top to bottom stratification, it's a lot more nebulous and there's definitely overlap. At least I think so. Mind you i've only been down here for a few years now, and it seems like a pretty big place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then where am I now, like what level is this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's the thing about heck, i can't tell you where you are, or how close you are, or even how you're doing, you have to figure it out for yourself, you have to do the work, you have to introspect, and you have to change yourself. you have to figure out where you are, why you're there, and then you choose what to do with that information. I mean, it's not too complicated, Like i said, in addition  to a bunch of other shitbaggy things i was an asshole to customer service people when i finished the level before this one, I walked out and there was dude at the desk just smackin the shit out of this little dinger and shouting at me to get over here and tell him what was going on, then another asshole and another. Until it finally dawned on me. Anyways you're in the land of your own accumulated shit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are you going to do about it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

All I know is that I\u2019m tired, my ribs hurt, that damn thud keeps trying to wake me up, and all I want to do is sleep for a few more minutes. *Thud! Thud! Thud!* Fuck me, fine, I\u2019m awake. I sit up and look around. No idea where I am, nothing strange there. At least that fucking thudding finally stopped. Rub the sleep out of my eyes, time to find someone who can tell me where I am. Glance around and what do I see? A kid. Young, seven or eight maybe. Who cares? Little bastard has chocolate smeared around his mouth, damn near spilling out of his clothes. Obviously, mommy has too much on her mind, keeps her spawn distracted with candy. Whatever works I suppose, God knows I\u2019d do the same to avoid dealing with the little snot-goblin.\n\n\u201cHey mister, you got any sweets?\u201d the sticky little worm dared to ask me.\n\nAs if a man of my talents would have sweets. No, as a matter of fact I don\u2019t. And even if I did, far be it from me to share them with you. Could stand to lose a few, couldn\u2019t you, lardass? I can\u2019t hear myself. *Thud!*\n\nThat little fucker just kicked me. Me! As if I was some common vagrant on the street. *Thud!* He did it again. Knock it off you little shithead, before I knock your teeth out and give them to your momma. *Thud!* Fuck! Why can\u2019t I move? *Thud!* Why can\u2019t I speak. What the fuck is going on? *Thud!*\n\n\u201cHey mister, I said, you got any sweets?\u201d the shit dared to ask again.\n\nI swear I\u2019m going to bash your head in. That confirmed it. I\u2019m definitely not speaking out loud. Sounds like I am, feels like I am, but I can\u2019t hear it. Can\u2019t hear myself speak. *Thud!* Can\u2019t hear myself think over this pounding. *Thud!* I\u2019m being kicked. Again. *Thud!* Last thing I remember is being kicked. Over and over and *Thud!* over again. I swear, if this little fuck kicks me one more- *Thud!* That\u2019s it, I\u2019m gonna get up and kill this little fucker. We\u2019ll see just how fun it is being kicked when it\u2019s his blood staining my shoe. Never killed a kid before, this seems like the perfect time to start. I stand up, dust myself off, and look him right in the eye\u2026 Why am I looking him right in the eye? I\u2019m every bit of six foot four. And I\u2019m looking him right in the eye.\n\nThis is a dream. Houses aren\u2019t made of candy. Streets are asphalt, not chocolate. And I\u2019m a grown man looking a little boy in the eye.\n\n\u201cNo sweets then. I guess we\u2019ll just have to see how you fare farther down.\u201d\n\nThat little fuck suddenly turned sadistic. Don\u2019t know how he did it. One minute I\u2019m staring a fat little fuck dead in the eye, next thing I know everything is going red. Not red like a fancy car or a firetruck, the cloudy red like a busted forehead won\u2019t stop pouring blood into your eyes but you just gotta ignore it, just because that fucker across from you is still standing. But I think I\u2019m gonna lose this fight. *Thud!* ",

            "comment": "My body felt weightless, until it didn't. It was like an invisible stone had been tied around my ankle and then dropped out of a plane. I had been rising before that. Hadn't I? I guess I hadn't really expected to go to that big happy factory in the sky with all the hipsters, trekkies and general goody goods . Still....\n\nI felt warm, like I was burning up on re-entry and then all at once I stopped, hanging in limbo. \"Welcome\" said a cheery voice. I couldn't move my head to see who was speaking, and my heart was still racing from my fall. \"Hello, welcome\", the voice said again. A Slight pink girl with bat wings and a pointed dragon's tail, came into view. She had thick framed glass that sat on the edge of her nose making her ice colored eyes bright. \"Name please\", she chirped.\n\n\"Whoo..oo....muh, me?\" I stammered.\n\n\"Yes you\" she laughed. It was then I noticed the clipboard she was holding. Was that a questionnaire? Hell already seemed exactly like I thought.\n\n\"Trin\" I cleared my throat. Trin Eugene Douglas.\n\n\"Hmmm\", she said, \"I don't see your name here, but that's alright sometimes the trip goes a little faster then our paperwork\", she snorted, pleased with herself.\n\n\"Okay\", I was worried I hadn't exactly been an upstanding citizen. I hadn't cared about the end. I thought I had a long time to wait, but at the same time people like me, well we live life faster then most I suppose. Makes sense we'd die faster... That I'd die faster. I wasn't looking forward to getting my just desserts. I had gambled on no after life, no mystical lands of judgement and retribution. I had lost.\n\n\"Alright\" she said breaking me out of thought, \"we can bypass some of the paperwork for now, After all we do have eternity\". She offered a pointed grin and stared at me expectantly. I offered a small smile that seemed to satisfy her. She continued \"I am Candice Batsblood, I will be your orientation leader today, please follow me\". She turned on her heel and began to walk away.\n\n\"Um, wait!\" I started. I struggled to move still unable to move stuck mid-fall.\n\n\"Oh right\", she turned a little, back towards me and snapped her fingers. The air let me go and I dropped to the ground falling on my hands and knees. \"I always forget that part, come along\", she began to prance away.\n\nI scrambled up and attempted to take in my surroundings. Candice lead me down a white hall. A shade I wasn't expecting to see in hell until I realized the brightness irritated my eyes. Weird maybe Hell wasn't made up of terrifying things Just little annoyances. I felt better with this thought. It was then I began sinking into the the floor. First up to the ankles and then the knees. I waded through the linoleum like it was quicksand. \"Ca-candice!\" I tried to alert her. Candice continued spryly on top walking at a quick pace \"Hurry up you slow poke\" she shouted back now and again.\n\nEventually Candice disappeared and I sunk even deeper, slowly. I tried to go back only to find the floor had returned to its normal state behind me. I was in to deep and the substance was to thick to pull myself out. The only way was forward.\n\nAfter what felt like hours I was up to my chest in floor and rounding the last corner to find Candice holding that large clipboard to her chest and tapping her, what I now noticed to be a hot pink cleft hoof, impatiently.\n\n\"Mr. Douglas, what happened to you?\" This was the first time I noticed something truly devilish in her sweet, albeit strange, exterior. I could feel myself beginning to rise. She watched unblinking I as I pulled myself out of the floor, onto, well the floor. There was a vile little grin on her face,  enjoying my struggle. \"Please,\" I grunted, \"Call me Trin\".\n\n\"Well then please call me Candice Batsblood\", she replied and began checking through the pages of the clipboard once again. I lay on the floor hand on my chest panting with exhaustion. She gave a disappointed huff, \"Your paperwork still has not arrived, that means we will have to place you in your circle order the old fashioned way\".\n\n\"Circle order?\" I asked standing shakily.\n\n\"Yes you are here because of your misdeeds on earth, we need to figure out which misdeed you committed the least and send you to that circle. Then you travel through the rest in order of least committed to most. Your placement is usually stated in your forms\". She frowned a little.\n\n\"You mean misdeeds like Adultery, Stealing and Murder?\" I asked, chest tightening.\n\nCandice Batsblood giggled and adjusted her glasses. \"No silly,\" She turned pulling back a maroon curtain I hadn't yet noticed. It was then I realized that we were standing on a balcony overlooking a colorful land. Seven glass domes like snow globes dominated the environment, shining so brilliantly I had to shield my eyes. \"that's hell\" she finished.\n\n\"What in the Heck\". I gaped at the scene.\n\n\"Yes that's right, you are in Heck, think of it as less cruel then hell, but less \"wonderful\", she dropped the papers to do air quotes, \"then Mediocrity, Boring's domain and Heaven, God's Domain\".\n\nWhat was I doing here? I had committed all of the Hell related sins three times over. I felt guiltier than I ever had on earth. I always managed to justify what I did. Clearly that hadn't worked out completely for me. However, maybe things wouldn't be quite so bad. Maybe the rulers of heck didn't have to know and the paperwork wouldn't arrive. So, instead of telling Candice Batsblood the truth, I asked a question. Telling the truth had never been in my nature anyways.\n\n\"Okay, so if Satan rule's hell, who rule's Heck?\"\n\n\"Gosh of course, what do they teach in religion studies now a days?\"\n\n\"Not this\", I shook my head in disbelief.\n\n\"I suppose this means you don't know the seven forgivable sins or the loophole\".\n\nI shrugged I couldn't take this in, or believe my luck.\n\n\"Unlike Hell or Heaven. Mediocrity and Heck are about rising, or falling. One or two last chances, depending on which one you are in. In Heck you can rise twice or fall once. It'd be a little different if you started in Mediocrity Heavens more... reachable\". Candace Batsblood still cheery, started to seem a little exasperated at my confusion. \"If you fail here you go to Hell to stay, if you get to Mediocrity from Heck and fail then you go to Hell. If you get through both you are absolved of your forgivable sins\"\n\n\"Then heaven?\"\n\n\"Maybe\".\n\n\"First we need to see which Forgivable sin you need to be forgiven of the least. There is Complaining, Teasing, Public indecency, Losing something you borrowed, Hitting and Spitting\". She listed off, counting on her fingers, clipboard now under her arm and glasses askew.\n\nI smiled wryly I could do this. \"Its harder to pass the test, then you think\", she said reading my mind. \"You also have to be placed first and that process without paperwork can be.... difficult.\"\n\nI didn't care, I wasn't in Hell for whatever reason and I had a chance at something better. \"Alright, sign me up\". I grinned truly for the first time since my death.\n\nCandice Batsbloods pink skin darkened red and ice eyes went to black \"As you wish\". Once again she snapped her fingers.\n\n\\----------\n\nCandice thought about her new charge after she sent him to the testing room. Something she normally would not even consider. She didn't think of Tren, just because she thought him handsome. Something had seemed, wrong. She sensed an all to familiar darkness in him. One she did not see in other humans here. It was a darkness that didn't belong.\n\nShe decided to go to the record hall and try to find a paper trail. If he wasn't meant to be there it might be fun to see what chaos came about. Candice Batsblood hadn't had that kind of fun in a millennium. Besides Heck needed a change,  it was not Mediocrity after all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

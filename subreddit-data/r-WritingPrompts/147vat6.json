            "comment": "To the casual observer, Andrea wasn't too dissimilar to the other interns running around the newsroom. She performed her job well, transcribing and delivering messages around the building, bringing coffee to the particularly tired-looking writers and researchers, offered advice and critique when requested, and generally put good effort into making herself useful. Indeed, her true nature would have been difficult to ascertain were it not for two major factors.\n\nFirstly, her manner of speech was unnatural as can be. When engaged in conversation about her life outside of work, she would smile and laugh, and then either change the subject or abruptly walk away. She would also ocassionally bungle up her instructions; one of the more infamous examples of this being on her first day, when she went down to the monster-infested sewers below the building, and returned with a black slime monster in a tupperware jar. At her coworker's bewildered expressions, she explains she was asked to retrieve some black coffee. After having her mistake explained to her, she simply stared blankly for a few seconds before apologizing and rushing off, leaving the container and its monstrous contents in her coworker's hands.\n\nStill, her oddness wouldn't be quite enough to raise warning bells within the company. She was generally well-liked, and besides, many of the creatures and races who work in the building have their own eccentricities when compared to each other. Having come to work in the guise of a grey-skinned, rough-looking woman, she'd carried the look of a foreigner, and as such may not speak the common tongue very well, explaining some of her confusion. Only, there was one more problem with her disguise, one that most would consider a larger red flag than her peculiarities.\n\nMuch of the newsroom was rigged with anti-magic fields. The moment she walked into the building, her disguise instantly melted away, revealing an androgynous blue humanoid figure, undressed and seemingly sexless. Their unnatural appearance garnered many strange looks from workers as she entered the building, but \"Andrea\" knew better than to let that get to them; they were a master infiltrator, after all. Strolling right up to the front counter, they shot the short man behind the desk an attempt at a friendly smile before showing the id badge they had clasped in their hands. Squinting in apparent confusion, the man looked down at the image of the rough-yet-ordinary looking woman smiling on the id card, and then back up to the alien-looking creature shooting him a wide grin.\n\n\"Hello!\" Andrea began, \"I'm the new hire. Your hair looks incredible. Take me to your news room so that I might do intern work!\"\n\nNow, if he were performing his job to the letter, he would refuse the strange... creature entry to the building, while waving over the security guards who were already watching the interaction from across the room with furrowed brows and hands at their blades. But. He couldn't deny the hilarity of the situation, as well as the charming earnestness of Andrea. So instead of doing his job, he smiled back at her, handed her back her ID, and gave her the intern employee badge she'd need to use the elevators. With another wide smile, she thanked him before spinning on her heel with decisiveness, heading on her way. The clerk chuckled to himself before looking down to his moniter, keeping an eye on the security cam footage of her destination, excited to see what her reception would be like.\n\nTo his surprise, once she made it upstairs, there wasn't all that much shock. The various workers only spared the new intern a strange glance, maybe a squint, before shrugging and returning to their work. Andrea took the looks in stride, walking with purpose to the most grand-looking person in the room and standing to attention a couple feet away from them.\n\nVania, an older spider-like woman, could only blink up at the being before her. Seeing her stare, Andrea raised both her hands to show off her id card, as well as her employee badge, before lowering them back to her side. \"Hello!\" she began, \"I'm Andrea, intern. Lovely to meet you, I love your eyes.\" Vania blinked. \"Please allow me access to your documents so that I might assist!\"\n\nVania blinked again. Her... documents? She glanced down at the papers before her; she was currently working on an article about the celebrity goblin pair being sighted at a downtown restaurant wearing engagement rings. Hardly the most interesting or sensitive work in the building, and definitely not a priority for having help sent to her. Still... she shrugged to herself. The situation was strange, the creature clearly not being the woman she so proudly presented on her id card, but, she made it this far into the building. Who was she to turn down offered help, strange as it was?\n\nBeckoning her over, Vania wheeled her chair over to the side a bit. Andrea flashed her wide smile once again, rounding the desk before crouching in a squat beside her coworker. Rapidly becoming accustomed to her coworker's strange behaviour she took the movement in stride, gesturing down at the paper before her. \"Have a read. Right now I'm doing the speculative phase of the article; these two are a city favourite as celebrities go, and the fact they're flashing engagement rings so soon after their affair scandal last week should turn a few heads. Still, I have to be careful about phrasing. They're well liked, so if I lean too hard into describing the scandal the article might not be well received.\"\n\nAndrea's eyes flicked rapidly across the notes and half-written article before her, an expression of utmost concentration on her face and her body completely still. A minute or so later she nodded decisively. \"The article is splendid, like you. However, when describing the couple, more emotive, excited language should help give the article a positive angle. That way when you do go over the drama involving the kiss with the cursed toad prince, people will be excited about the woman's boldness and kindness and her fiance's understanding, rather than questioning you implying an affair in the article.\"\n\nOnce again Vania blinked; her race usually only did so once or twice a day, but she found herself on track to beat her personal record from this one conversation. The advice was very blunt, despite the... kind compliment at the start. However, she couldn't deny the advice was sound; she'd picked up the habit to write in a matter-of-fact way when journalising, but for a drama piece like this, she could pepper in some more fun words so it didn't come off cold. For the first time today she found herself smiling. This \"Andrea\" was as bizarre as they come, but she seemed competent, genuinely interested in Vania's work, and undaunted by her spider-like traits. \n\n\"I agree with your input, thank you dear. I'll be sure to put your advice into practice.\" Andrea seemed to bask in the praise, her somewhat eerie smile only widening at her words. \"I think I'll be ok from here, but I'll be sure to call you over when I've finished the first draft.\" At her words, Andrea rose to her feet in one smooth quick motion, gave a sharp... salute? Before spinning on the spot and approaching another person, seemingly at random.",

                    "comment": "And so, the pattern continued. Andrea would confidently and bizarrely introduce herself to everyone in the newsroom, offer them help or advice, and cement herself as a valuable and earnest worker. Many were just happy to have someone to lend an ear and offer their thoughts, enjoying an intern interested in doing more than the bare minimum. Work in the newsroom was hard, and looking out for yourself had unfortunately become part of the culture; time was a precious commodity, and lending a hand elsewhere risked your own work falling behind in the news cycle. Somehow though, Andrea managed to buck this trend with apparent gusto, striving to assist every single worker at one point or another, from the researchers to the janitors. Needless to say, the whole room was slowly becoming delighted with the new hire. She made the ocassional strange mistake, but they were easy to forgive in the face of her earnest helpfulness.\n\nAfter making such an impact on the newsroom, it didn't take long for Andrea's work to be noticed by the higherups. A few weeks into her internship, a message was passed to her while she squatted at Vania's desk, helping her with her latest article. She gave the note a once-over; she was wanted upstairs for a brief meeting with their boss. Peering over Andrea's shoulder, Vania scowled; her opinion on their management had never been high, especially after they'd put her on these silly puff pieces last month. \"Andrea,\" she started, smiling slightly when the intern immediately gave her her full attention. \"If the boss tries to pull anything, come to me. I don't trust the guys upstairs as far as I can throw them. If they try and give you the boot, I'll back you up.\"\n\nFor her part, Andrea just flashed her usual wide smile. \"Not to worry! I will look after myself in this affair, but your concern is appreciated and valued.\" Vania huffed, shaking her head. Whatever this girl is, she's too precious.\n\nAfter a few more supportive words Vania let her go, chuckling as Andrea, true to form, spun on her heel and headed for the elevator at the back of the room. A few workers smiled or gave her supportive nods as she went, having overheard the conversation. Andrea just grinned at them as she went, only letting her expression drop as she entered the elevator. Inputting the button for the floor above, she took a deep breath and steeled herself before the elevator doors opened again, walking out with confidence the moment the space was given.\n\nBefore long she found herself right where she wanted to be; overseer Dalriya's office. Announcing herself with a quick knock, she pressed her employee badge to the scanner before allowing herself in.\n\nFor their part, Dalriya sat primly at their desk, a wry smile spreading across their face as Andrea entered. Without a word they gestured to the chair across from their desk, which Andrea quickly lowered herself into. For a few seconds, no words were spoken, Dalriya simply staring at the creature before them. Eventually the tense moment breaks, Dalriya allowing themselves a small chuckle before speaking.\n\n\"Well, I'll admit, I had my doubts about you.\" Andrea said nothing. \"You waltz in here, bold as you please, and insist you're this 'Andrea' lady. As if you didn't even notice your disguise melt off you the second you walked in the building.\" Still, Andrea didn't speak.\n\nDalriya took her silence as acknowledgement, raising from their desk to lean further across it, their frame much more intimidating. \"If it were up to me, we'd have gotten anyone else for this job. An approach that bold, that *stupid*, it aught to have failed.\"\n\n\"But it didn't.\" Andrea spoke up, expression unmoving.\n\nDalriya smirked. \"Indeed.\" They laughed again before closing their eyes. All at once their form shimmered before seeming to fade, revealing what lay below; a blue, androgynous, unclad figure, unrecognizable aside from the smirk they still carried. \"I daresay you're the first of our kind to pull off an infiltration with our true form. In only a few weeks you've got the trust of the whole newsroom. I'll admit, I might've gotten a bit cocky after I took on the Overseer's persona. Upwards momentum is hard to attain without trust and recognition, something you clearly understand.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not called the master infiltrator for nothing.\"\n\nIn response Dalriya inclined their head; a respectful gesture. \"I was wrong to doubt. Your title is well earned. Between the two of us, the company will be ours.\"\n\nAndrea nodded. \"I have a few conditions.\" Dalriya raised a featureless brow, gesturing for them to continue. \"The workers, they have no small amount of disdain for the management. Not only will they support me- us, they'll likely help in our rise through the company. One of the veteran workers, Vania, she got practically demoted by the old Dalriya for speaking against management. Once the company is ours, I want them rewarded. They're good people.\"\n\nDalriya barked out a laugh. \"My, charmed you, have they?\" Still, they nodded. \"You're right though, no need for good people to get caught up in this. Your advice is sound.\"\n\nFor the first time during the conversation, Andrea smiled. \"It's what I do.\"",

Steve was a new employee and, well, everyone could tell that he was a mimic, but he was nice and they needed the extra help anyway. \r  \nAs she was about to pick up another glass, a fighter looking man approached her bar.\r  \n\u201cHello there, what can I get for ya today?\u201d\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m actually not thirsty right now, but I did want to know if you were aware of the mimic working here?

She eyed them and turned back to the speaker, \u201cEh, no thanks, they are a pretty good worker so I kinda like them here.\u201d\n\n\r\u201cWhat? But they\u2019re a mimic! Quite dangerous you know!\u201d He looked baffled.\r  \n\u201cAnd? Have you ever seen someone who can literally mop the floors or turn into any tool you might ever need? Plus they have a better work ethic than any of the other low-lives looking for quick gold.\u201d\r  \nHe stared at her for a second and then started to turn away, \u201c Yeah I think you\u2019ve been somehow influenced by it, we\u2019ll kill the mimic and just talk about payment later.\u201d\r  \nHe said it loud enough for the whole tavern to hear and so in a flash every weapon was pointed towards the questers.\r  \nA scarred burly sailor slowly rose from his corners seat next to the questers.\r  \n\u201cWhat did you just say.\u201d\r  \nThe questers were standing up tense and one of them slowly answered, \u201c We are just going to kill the mimic and be on our way, we don\u2019t want any problems.\u201d\r  \nThe sailor stepped closer and in the tense silence his footsteps echoed like miniature earthquakes.\r  \n\u201cYou. will. not. touch. Steve.\u201d With each word said the questers took a step back from the sailor nervously.\r  \nThe sailor had steered them towards the main entrance and pointed to them, \u201cYou kids now better run along before you get into something you can\u2019t finish.\u201d\r  \nWith a glaring crowd the questers were smart enough to know when to cut their losses and ran with their tails between their legs. Just as they exited, Steve entered.\r  \nHe made a face, which was probably supposed to resemble confusion, \u201c Hello fellow human beings, I finished a normal task! Why are we standing up?\u201d\n\n\rIn a second all weapons were put away again, because they made Steve nervous, and everyone was back to a good mood. The sailor patted his shoulder and smiled widely, \u201c Ah, Stevey-boy, could ya bring me another pint of ale?\u201d\r  \nSteve\u2019s face broke out in a beaming smile, \u201cYes! Of course I, as a human, am able to carry you another wooden cup filled with fermented beer, brewed from malted barley. Yes.\u201d And swiftly started to stumble/run toward the bar, where Isla gave Martin, the actually really sweet sailor, an appreciative smile.",

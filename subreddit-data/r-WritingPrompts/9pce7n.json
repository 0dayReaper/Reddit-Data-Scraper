            "comment": "I know what I am. More importantly, I know what I am not, but I still know the names. The names people spit with vitriol when my face is plastered on the news. Anarchist, terrorist, monster, savage. That\u2019s fine with me. Let them spew their verbal sludge from their high horses knowing good and well they\u2019d do the same in my position. So I\u2019ll play my part and be their boogeyman spawned from hell to take the lives of men, women, and children innocent in their bed. I\u2019ll be the villain that they\u2019ll tell their kids about as a bedtime scary story. \n\nI am no monster, or savage, or boogeyman. I\u2019m just a man. A man who has the balls to do what\u2019s necessary when the time comes, and now the time has come. The time to end the corruption, the lies, the falsity of this damnable government. I will blow their tower of deceit back to the seventh circle of hell from which it came. The time has come to return this land to the people. Sometimes you need a wildfire to burn out the deadwood and my bombs are the spark.\n\nBut he\u2019s coming. He\u2019s always fucking coming the persistent bastard. For months we\u2019ve waged war from South Africa to Chechnya and now he\u2019s coming again. He\u2019s slowed my progress, the peoples progress, but no longer. In another time we may have been allies and probably even friends, working together to better this place but that time has long since passed. I respect him for the tenacity of which our battles have been fought, like rams butting heads, we have been locked in this dance of death for a long time but now it\u2019s time for a victor. The poor guy sees the world as black and white and no matter my efforts, he refuses to see the gray domain where I roam and has pegged me for the darkness. \n\n\u201cSir? He\u2019s here. He came in where we expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many did it take to subdue him?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo many.\u201d\n\n\u201cA price that needed paying. Where is he now?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the interrogation room. He\u2019s bound at the hands and feet and he knows you\u2019re coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nI have no superpowers though now I wish I did. It would make this easier. Grabbing my revolver off the desk where my security monitors are located, I open the chamber to make sure it\u2019s loaded, it is, and solemnly begin the short walk to the interrogation room. Ha. Interrogation room. It\u2019s a movie set I ordered built in this warehouse that I\u2019ve been feigning as my base of operations. At the risk of bragging, it was a brilliant trap. I had watched him sneak into my compound on my little TVs, take out a few of my dime-a-dozen guards, and then eventually cut my video feeds. It was ending today one day one way or another, and it will not be with my demise. Luckily, for me, he was outnumbered, ambushed, and captured. He demanded that he see me face to face. I know he wants to save me, bring me to the light as it were, but the light doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s all just shades of gray. \n\nAs I walk past the one way mirror, I see him sitting there, bound to a table with three guards watching him face the door with steely determination. Well, facing A door. I meander around to the back of the room cursing him for making me do this to him. Why did you demand this you prideful, brave, fool? You are no hero more than I am a villain, but I suppose he plays his role in the same vain as I play mine. I double check my revolver, still loaded.\n\n\u201cHas he moved?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sir. He can\u2019t move without being seen by a guard and they have shoot on movement orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey should\u2019ve shot him already,\u201d I say before I silently slip in the hidden door in the back of the room. There sits my nemesis, still bound hand and foot, sitting in a chair with his back to me. Slowly raising my revolver, I hold my breath so as not to make even the slightest noise. The spot is easy enough to find, if you know what you\u2019re looking for and have some experience, of which I am in unfortunately in no short supply. My revolver settles on a spot just below the base of the skull about 2 inches from the bottom of his short cut, blonde hairline. In the snap of your fingers it\u2019s over. The bullet severed his brain stem but missed the skull. None of the blood even got on my shoes, just followed the bullet through and out under his chin. No fuss, no muss. I roll the body over of my fallen adversary. He was a good man doing what he thought was right just as I am doing what I think is right. His bright blue eyes are calm and lifeless. You never really get used to looking into the eyes of someone whose life has just been snuffed out by your own hand. It was never what I wanted, but what was needed. I press my revolver into his chest above the heart and pull the trigger until the gun clicks. No tears, no guilt, no come to Jesus moment; just respect for a man who does what he needs to do.\n\n\u201cWhat now sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cBurn the motherfucker down.\u201d",

            "comment": "Being a hero means not going around making sure everyone knows you're a hero. It means you don't wear a bright flashy outfit, you don't pose for the cameras, and you don't go around telling everyone who you are.\n\nIt also means that sometimes, you have to be willing to do things that others won't. Sometimes it means that you have to do things that will make you hated. Because what you do is more important than your reputation, it's more important than recognition... it's more important than *you*.\n\nWhat I'm about to do, most would call murder. But they don't see what I see. I see someone who calls himself a hero when he's anything but. He's the sort to wear the bright colors, to pose for every photo op, he even has a fan club for kids. For *kids*. But I've seen what he's like when he thinks no one is looking, how he takes joy in hobbling and suffocating innocent people. He has killed more people than any of these so-called \"villains\" he fights. And he needs to be stopped, even if it means being despised for it. That's what a *real* hero would do.\n\nHe calls himself Captain Justice. I know who he really is. Bradley Evans. Captain of his high school football team, valedictorian, sociopath. Always excelled, always succeeded at life, often at the expense of others, people he stepped on or crushed to get ahead in life. Now he's moved on from stepping on classmates to stepping on the good people of this city. No more.\n\nI open the door to his house, lock easily picked. He doesn't have any security system, no guard dog. Why would he need one? He's Captain Justice, and he thinks he's invincible. But every man needs to sleep.\n\nI find his bedroom, with him in his bed. Good. I can make this quick, easy. I bring out my knife. Not a steel knife, mind you, but a ceramic one. I've studied the man enough to see that steel won't pierce his skin, but for some reason, he was cut by a thrown flowerpot on one occasion. Evidently ceramic is some sort of weakness of his. Don't know why.\n\nAs I approach, his eyes open. Damn that super-hearing of his. He lays eyes on me approaching, and speaks not a word. He doesn't ask why I'm here, doesn't give me any \"heroic\" warning, just gets into a fighting stance. Ah well, not so easy after all. Well, if I should die in this fight, so be it.\n\nHe punches toward me with a speed and strength that could shatter bone. I dodge to the side, barely evading him. He reaches for my throat and I jump back, a mere fraction of a second before his fist closes shut with a force that could have instantly crushed my windpipe. Our dance goes on like this, with him attacking and me evading, but I know that I can't keep doing this. If I'm on the defensive, I have to be lucky every time, and he only needs to be lucky once. I need to go on the offense.\n\nI thrust my knife at him, misjudging the distance to him and missing him by inches. He responds with a smirk, seeing the knife and finding it amusing. He then reaches his fist back for a punch and I'm overextended, some part of me knows I can't dodge in time. In desperation, I fall forward, knife held above me.\n\nIt plunges deep into his neck.\n\nFor a moment, we two are frozen there. I am terrified that any movement will spur him to act, that if he even thinks for a single second, this terrible man will surely reach out and end me. But perhaps there is some greater power looking over me, because he does no such thing. He only slumps over backward, wheezing as he struggles for breath.\n\nI don't have any sort of killer ironic line to drop on him at this point, no pithy catchphrase. He may have been a monster, but he was also a man, and no man's death deserves to be treated lightly, even one so terrible as this.\n\nRather than make him suffer, I withdrew the knife from his neck and plunged it into his ear, skewering his brain. His wheezing stopped and he fell silent. I removed my knife and went to the sink to cleanse it, making sure not to leave any fingerprints or any other indication of who I am.\n\nI could breathe again. This nightmare was over. True, there were other nightmares to face, but that could wait until tomorrow. For tonight, I could sleep well, knowing that this man would never again be a blight on this city, never again would he hobble them by doing for them things they should find the capacity to do for themselves, never again would he suffocate them by treating them as a master treats a pet, protecting them and scolding them whenever they do wrong, instead of treating them like men, capable of learning and growing and standing on their own two feet.\n\nTomorrow, the city will wake, and there will be no more Captain Justice, and everyone can begin the healing process, no longer looking to the skies for someone to save them, but looking within themselves. I expect no thanks for this deed. I expect to be hated. But a true hero doesn't care what others think. He only cares that he has made the world a better place.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nThank you for reading!

In a society where superheroes are a valid profession and most people treat it like that (for fame, for money, for revenge; some are strong, some are weaks), it means that for him most heroes aren't worth of the title. So he kills the \"fake heroes\" or cripple them to weed out the good from the bad. The thing is that his view is so distorted that only one hero (All Might, top #1, think like Superman) is the real deal.\n\nIf you're into superhero stuff I highly recommend Boku no Hero, even if you've never seen an anime. It's beginner friendly, the quality it's top notch and the MC is like poor shy batman that suddenly gets the power of Superman.",

Is a sociopathic person who does good deeds and genuinely helps people out of the need to be praised a better or worse human being than a highly empathetic person who does terrible things for \"greater good\"? What makes someone a villain worth murdering, and how should a superhero go about murdering non-super, but still dangerous villains, to escape being labeled a murderer himself? Is it right for one person to decide what is better or worse for humanity as a whole, and should all superheroes be blamed or outright murdered for the crime of allowing people to rely on them? Is it bad to have an ego when it motivates you to become the better version of you?\nAnyway, as a person who struggled with empathy during their youth and was fixated on success due to unhealthy expectations and pressure, I wish we got to hear Captain Justice's side of the story. The details on what exactly the kid had done to make him worthy of death penalty, aside from liking to be in the spotlight and making people rely on him too much, are kind of blurry. It's not that I'm calling the protagonist a true villain, it's just that many villains and heroes are much deeper than what they seem, regardless of capes, and hearing both sides give their testaments is important when taking sides in a conflict.",

How the blackened dart wouldn\u2019t reflect any light, giving the Cowl no chance to jump out of its way.\n\nOf course, I had to change Shade's deadly poison for a knockout dose. Now I had the Orange Cowl hanging upside-down over the piranha tank. He was just coming to. Finally! He would know that **I** was the one to bring him down. All through his agonizing dismemberment, he would understand, at long last, just what his actions all those years ago had truly cost him. He would pay for his sins, and know just how much he was paying.\n\n\u201cWh\u2026 wha?\u201d he spluttered. Good, he was waking up. Cape hanging down behind him, he must have felt the blood rush to his head, because he quickly reached up towards his feet.\n\n\u201cOh, you won\u2019t find them that easy to untie,\u201d I drawled. \u201cTitanium alloy chains, welded together. No locks to pick this time, my little Cowl!\u201d\n\nHe seemed to still be coming to his senses. \u201cNuclear Scorpion,\u201d he hissed. \u201cI should have known. You *madman*!\u201d\n\nHow dare he? After all he had done. After all *I* had done. \u201cMad, am I?\u201d I cried. \u201cWas it madness when I carefully chose the street names for each child's body? Was it madness when I calculated that you would figure out the pattern after the fifth! Was it madness when I\u2026\u201d \n\nBut I couldn't finish. An explosion near to me drown me out, and then Orange Cowl was still. A bright red spot blossomed on the center of his forehead. \n\nI hadn\u2019t heard Shade open the warehouse door behind me. I hadn\u2019t heard him walk up beside me. I hadn\u2019t heard a thing until he pulled the trigger.\n\nShade. The one who had given me victory now stole it from my clutches. \u201cHow could you!\u201d I cried, spinning around on him. \u201cI finally had him in my power! He was at *my* mercy, and finally knew that _I_ had triumphed. How... dare...  you  ...\u201d\n\nMy voice dropped as shade swung the gun back up. Its barrel stared at my left eye, inches away. With my right, I saw him turn his head and regard me quizzically, as though I was a puzzle, or a strange kind of insect he had never before seen.\n\nHis voice was quiet, as velvety as ever. \u201c*You* triumphed?\u201d He sounded curious more than anything else. \u201cI wonder why you ever thought you were more than a convenient tool?\u201d\n\nAnd for the second time, he pulled the trigger.",

It's a really ordinary kind of place where anyone tries to do anything really big, they don't last long. It's a nice play on Cape Grave, the real name of this pleasant, ordinary town.\n\nMe? I don't have a hero name, or a villain name, but they called me \"Jinx\" in school. \n\nWe didn't have school shootings, but the guy with a rifle coming for revenge tripped and blew his own brains out when it hit the ground and discharged. The Twilight Bomber somehow managed to implode himself after taking a class full of third-graders hostage, me included.\n\nToo bad about Containment Lass, though. It was a really great entry through the window to save us until she tripped over a desk and got a pencil through the eye. Tragic.\n\nMe, that third grader? When they died, I never felt better, like I'd managed to find my purpose in life without even knowing it, that something about the world was always going to be going my way. I took up a hobby every kid does in the age of supers- superwatching. \n\nRemember that freak cascading failure in the Flying Brick's armored suit that sent him face first into a kiddie pool and he drowned in front of thousands on cam? I sure do. I was watching.\n\nStupor being electrocuted by a live wire in the middle of the night while hanging out on a roof? I was on the roof across the street, having a bite at the Skytop Diner as he was about to swoop in on a bank robbery. It's not my fault he grabbed the wire instead of the grapnel line.\n\nAnacord tearing that car in half, only to be showered with it's cargo of metanarcotics and ODing on the spot? I was in the car that blocked it off just enough from getting through on the bridge exit. Made it an easy grab for his kill shot on Crystal Method.\n\nMethod should have checked his sound system before playing that victory song, though. Instant sinkhole and landing on top of that gas main? Charcoal.\n\nFamous supers inevitably end up swooping in to save the day, and if I'm watching? It's the last swoop. Supervillians always getting on camera, monologue about how they're going to take over the world? You know how badly that's gone the last dozen times, every death a freak accident of superscience or magic gone wrong when it isn't some pathetic end.\n\nI'm fond of Destrominator's minion tipping over that cup of water on a console just as he pushed the Domination Ray's trigger, causing it to backfire and burn out all of his higher brain functions.  I'm even more fond of the last gasp it gave that turned Savior's noggin into tapioca pudding when he turned the camera around to tell the world they'd been saved.\n\nI'm almost sixty-eight now, but I look like a thirty-year old in her prime. The docs say I'm lucky, must be a metagene. \n\nI don't know where I get all the luck. Has to be coming from somewhere. Or someone. Six hundred, seventy-six someones so far. And you? You decided you're going to stop me.\n\nI have no idea what went wrong, but that jet-assisted boost into low orbit was very impressive, if totally unplanned. Without life support.\n\nSix hundred, seventy-seven.\n",

            "comment": "  \n\nUgh its happened again, another vigilante that takes it upon himself to stop me and another hole I\u2019m forced to dig before leaving town. The real pain in the ass is moving again. This is the fourth time this year and I\u2019m truly dreading the thought of packing and unpacking. \n\nThey call themselves heroes. These masked freaks that go around meddling in another person\u2019s business. For the most part I don\u2019t mind them. They\u2019re usually too busy catching the loud and stupid morons the city considers criminal masterminds. Unfortunately for me I popped up on *his* radar. Once these \u201cheroes\u201d have their sights set on you there\u2019s no shaking them. They become obsessed with you. The last guy I had to get rid of was a prime example. He was able to track me past state lines. I must admit I did have some fun trying to lose him. Didn\u2019t expect him to have a teenage sidekick though. I buried them together. Kids weren\u2019t ever really my thing. I had to lay low for a while after that. They turned out to be high-profile victims. Ever since then I don\u2019t take any chances. If anyone of these heroes was half as good as the bat freak I would be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life.  \n\nIt all started last week while I was watching TV. I was enjoying Seinfeld reruns when the breaking news alert interrupted my Soup Nazi episode. Was going to shut it off and go to bed but then I saw the bag on the screen. I knew the second I saw it what was going on. It\u2019s my fault really, didn\u2019t check the forecast this time around. To think the body would washup after the storm, I knew I should have added more weight to the bag. Not thinking twice, I started to pack and was half way to my closet when I heard his voice. I couldn\u2019t believe it the prick was on TV going on about justice and making promises to the city he wasn\u2019t going to keep. He just had to get involved. He called himself the Blue Defender. If you couldn\u2019t tell by his name law enforcement loved the guy. He was at their fundraising events, the policeman ball, they even gave him the key to the city. This made him easy to find. Oh yeah, the same day I moved in to the city I did my research. Took me three weeks to find out his identity. Jeremy Murphy, good old Jere had a life outside of the Blue Defender. A job, friends, family, hell even a girlfriend. Got to give it to him he was making this hero thing look easy. I sat on all this information until today until I needed to use it. \n\nI moved in on his girlfriend first. Don\u2019t worry she\u2019s alive I don\u2019t need any more attention drawn to me. She works out of the Starbucks off Third and Main. You guessed it she\u2019s a writer. It\u2019s strange to me how much we are creatures of habit. Every Tuesday Jeremy and Monica meet up at Starbucks for lunch from 12:15 to 12:45 they talk about work and laugh a bit then they kiss and say their goodbyes and Jeremy walks back to work. He always takes the same route back.  He passes an alley where an old homeless man has set up shop begging for money. And every Tuesday he gives the homeless man his leftovers and his change. This time the old man was sitting against the wall with his head sunken into his chest. He is deeper in the alley than usual. Jeremy calls out to him.  No response. He walks up to him and checks his pulse nothing. Takes out his phone to call an ambulance but before he can dial 9 the knife was already half way in his neck. I dragged him and hobo Joe back to my truck. Cleaned up the alley the best I could making sure I got all the blood. Drove an hour out of town to this old abandoned factory and started to dig. I buried them together. God how I hate moving tonight is going to be a pain in the ass.  ",

            "comment": "I know that I have a reputation. I know that even other villains are afraid of me, and that behind closed doors they are all too quick to call me a monster.\n\nI find this a little ironic. While the various hero and villain associations like to keep their public image very Saturday morning cartoon, I know how things are run behind closed doors. \n\nWhen a villain goes off radar, it\u2019s not always because they\u2019re in jail and that when the hero association says someone is doing \u201cunder cover work\u201d it\u2019s typically because they are either dead or in therapy.\n\nThe best kept secret in both industries is that nobody manages to truly retire.  As soon as you hang up the cape you\u2019ve essentially painted a target on you and everyone you love, and no one from either organization is going to come to save you. \n\nI gained my reputation from trying to change that. \n\nIt was a harsh lesson that my family quickly learned when my father, Ernest Belldin , better known as Dogtor Wolfman , was targeted. Looking back on it, the heroes who decided he was a good person to squeeze for information where probably newbies. \n\nAfter all he was hardly the most dangerous person on the council, especially considering the whole point of him joining the council in the first place was to earn enough money to treat his condition.\n\nHonestly in a perfectly world, my father would have been considered a great man, if not a little flawed, man of science.  \nAlthough his cure didn\u2019t completely eliminate our family curse, it did neuter it\u2019s negative effects enough that it\u2019s predicted that a few generations down the line it could be considered a genuine super power. \n\nUnfortunately my children and I still hold enough lupine characteristics to draw attention.  Once it became clear that my father had held onto enough villain tech that he wasn\u2019t as easy a target as they were expecting , they started targeting me. \n\nWhile I wasn\u2019t thrilled with this development, I was more accepting of this than when they decided to start threatening my children.   \n\nAlthough their severed heads were supposed to be more of a warning to other hotshots who try to mess with my family, the Council of villainy took it as my application letter. \n\nI tried to avoid getting too involved with them, but when my bills started to stack up, I found the allure of easy cash was too hard to ignore. \n\nUnfortunately my first official team up happened to be with the Grand Inquistor. \nI can assure that whatever the papers say about me, he was a million times worse. \n\nI had chosen to work for him because of his anti-hero reputation. \nHowever after working with him for about a week, I quickly learned that he was a dangerous sociopath who had a serious hard on for taking revenge on the heroes who he saw as having wronged him by any means necessary.\n\nAlthough working with him was a torturous experience in its own right, I appreciated that it taught me exactly what kinds of things I could live with myself after doing. \n\nUnsurprisingly, while I have no issues with killing heroes, torturing children and the elderly is my breaking point. \n\nAs you can probably guess, I decided to make an example of the Inquistor. \nWhile this didn\u2019t make me especially popular with the council, it definitely got the word out.  Some of the smarter heroes and retirees had an ear out for the gossip on my end. \n\nWhile they fear me, they know that if someone threatens their families, they can come to me ",

            "comment": "Ultra Man watched his grapple soar up and over the roof of the abandoned warehouse. There was a satisfying clink, and in seconds he was speeding upwards. From his new vantage he looked out across the city and saw pulsating red and blue lights as the man hunt continued. *Probably for the best that it's just me*, he thought as he put his grappling gun back in it's holster and turned to see a skylight windows ahead of him. \n\n\"Bingpot.\"\n\nStepping forward he looked down, and was greeted by all sorts of dastardly machinery, with blinking lights and hard to understand interfaces. He'd seen this equipment once before, the last time Electro had escaped his grasp. Strangely, there were no henchman operating the devices.\n\nWithout thinking he stomped down onto the glass, and almost fell through ungracefully as the skylight shattered. He lowered himself carefully through the broken shards of glass, then deployed his trusty wings. Gliding down serenely he saw that the room was abandoned, seemingly in the middle of a party. *What could a man so sinister possibly have to party about?* Ultra Man landed next to a machine.\n\nBefore he had more time to take in his surroundings, there was a pounding on a plain brown door he hadn't noticed before. \n\n\"Guys! Can you let me in? I think I left my keys.\" a voice said through the door.\n\nUltra Man hesitated briefly, before walking silently to the door. He leaned into the peephole, only to see a brown haired man in jeans and a T-shirt smiling back at him. Ultra Man unlocked the door and rared back his right fist. It swung open immediately, and Ultra Man watched the man's eyes widen at his caped crusading image. \n\n\"Where's Electro?!\" Ultra Man demanded.\n\n\"Uhm, ah uh- Electro?\"\n\n\"Yes, your boss, were is he?\"\n\n\"He... uh, he left.\" \n\n\"Not likely. The cops are swarming this town, everyone in the city is on the lookout.\" \n\n\"I think I saw him in the alley out back.\" the man said suddenly, as if remembering. \n\nUltra man pushed him aside, and ran through the door to find himself in an alley all alone. After checking all of the dark corners, he walked calmly back into the door. \n\n\"You know, I was going to go easy you if you cooperated.\" he said.\n\nHe froze in the middle of his entrance. There was a loud bang. He felt a strange warmth down his stomach, and looked down to see his black suit covered in crimson. Before he knew what was happening he was on his knees. The man from before stood holding a pistol off to his immediate right. \n\n\"I knew you'd come after me, Ultra Man, but I was hoping you wouldn't. You always had the most heart out of all you little heroes. I'm almost sorry to tell you it's over. Now that I've gone through with it, nobody needs you or I any more.\" he said, before raising the pistol to his temple and pulling the trigger. \n\nUltra Man felt himself fade very slowly. \n\n___\n/r/Periapoapsis exists",

            "comment": "Quick and Efficient.  That's my trade.  \n\nMovies always get it wrong.  People fantasize about all the wrong things.   They let their hatred and past injustices run wild inside their own mind because that's the only place it's permissible to feel those things.  The imagination runs wild about how they get their justice, and are understood.  Or at the very least, make a deadly last stand that does massive damage worthy of remembrance.  Davy Crocket was never forgotten, and neither was the Alamo.  \n\nThese romanticizations are the cream of my crop, and I harvest them without a thought.   \n\nBack Track:  \n\nI'm not a sociopath or a psychopath.  I'm not cold as ice like a gangster.  Nobody hurt me to where I want to hurt others.   I actually like people.  I enjoy friends nights and activities.  I have fun hobbies like cooking, and coffee.   I like to sing.  I love my wife.   \n\nYep, most laymen always get people like me wrong.   Especially the ones that romanticize.   People who dream of being an assassin want to kill and hurt others.  Either for some warped narcissistic moral ideal, or because they're a psychopath and enjoy inflicting pain in others, or complete domination to the death.  \n\nThe help I receive from these people are paramount.  If anyone of these people ever get the balls to actually go through with it, they'll get caught and brag about how smart they were with every little detail.  Only, they obviously overlooked one thing.  At least one, because they got caught.  \n\nThe problem wasn't their plan.  I'm sure it was meticulous.  It was that they were stupid enough to allow themselves the emotional satisfaction of their work.   Whether it's enjoyment or even self loathing.  They let themselves be emotional.  They had to win.  \n\nIt's not about winning.  You never win as an assassin.  You do.   It's not about emotions, and if you're emotional, don't do the job.   Simple as that.  For example, I don't kill kids.  I can't handle that.  Kids are innocent.  They don't deserve a hit.   If you're emotional, don't do the job.  It's as simple as that.  \n\nQuick and Efficient.  Get in, do the job, get out.   Prepare, and plan.  Do a practice run or two.  Stay fit, and act quick.  \n\n9 times out of 10, it's going to be a complete surpise.  Don't waste that element.  Remember John Wick?  He got his ass handed to him, and they played around with him.  Then they let him live.  Everyone, no matter how well trained, cannot react to an instant surprise that kills them.  They should have killed him.\n\nHow do I morally deal with this?  My internal emotions for snuffing people out?   Well.  Here's the thing.  It's none of my business, and as long as there is war and hatred, I'll have a job.  You want to put me out of work?  Love your fellow man, and just treat each other with dignity and respect.   That's it.   But since you can't, I'm employed.   \n\nYou want to learn how to be the most deadly assassin ever?   It's simple.  \n\nStep 1:  Stay Fit.  Eat Right and Exercise.   \n\nStep 2:  Be social, go out.  Have fun.  Enjoy your life.  \n\nStep 3:  Have an actual job.  The IRS needs a reason for you having money anyway, and it's good to stay busy.   \n\nStep 4:  Never kill anyone you know.  You can punch them if they screw with you.  But don't kill them.   In fact, don't kill anyone within 50 miles of you.  Seriously, if you drive an hour, nobody will know.  50 is good.  \n\nStep 5:  Steps 3 and 4 together.  Just be a normal person.  Wear normal inconspicuous clothing.  Keep your hair trimmed.  Etc.  (Can you tell that by mentioning this three times in three separate rules, it's kind of important.)\n\nStep 7:  Accepting the job.  \n\nStep 8:  Prepare.   Know the target.   Have a plan.  Carry it out.  Leave.  \n\nStep 9:  Don't save anything that was used in the murder.   Not your clothes.  Your car.  Anything.  It all gets thrown away or dismissed.   For example, the car.   Traffic cameras can follow your car away from a crime scene.  It's not rocket science.  After the job, you have to disappear without leaving any leads.   So everything you use, you get rid of.   \n\nStep 10:  Forget!  This is important because most people can't do this tiny simple thing.  Have you ever had a bad or hard day at work.  You get home, wind down a bit, and forget.  You have to do the same thing after you finish a job.  Sure, it can be a rush, but that's an emotion.  You've got to let it go.  Let it go Elsa.   \n\nStep 11:  Go back to living your normal life.  Go back to work.  Nobody will be the wiser.  You'll never be questioned about it later if you did your job right.  You're a ghost.   \n\nWe can discuss logistics later, but that's basically the mindset you have to have if you want to survive in this trade.   Oh, by the way.  That's a trade-off that you make to work in this industry.  Understand that if you kill someone, your life is forfeit.  You may get caught.  You may live.  You might survive to old age.  But when you kill someone, for whatever reason, you're making the conscious decision to trade your life for theirs.   Whether it's death, life in prison, or whatever.  That's the trade that you make.   Sure, you might never have to pay the piper.  But you should damn well be aware of the price.   Then be OK with it.  At peace.   \n\nIt might be worth it too.  Imagine someone killed your entire family.  Would your life be worth it to make them pay?  Vengeance is a powerful motivator.  Sure, you'll get caught.  It's an emotion.  But would it be worth it?   I think so.   As for me, a payday every now and again is worth the trade.  I'm not really worth much, and when you step back and look at the world.  It's pretty obvious.  Life is cheap.   \n\nOn the flipside, it does give me a little peace of mind to know that most people with the ambition to become an assassin have absolutely no idea how to get a client.  ",

I have a flawless record. I took down Mr Amazing last month, and that is more than most of my classmates can ever hope to achie...\"\n\nThe old Colonel had started massaging his temples. \"I'm gonna stop you right there son. I just don't think you are a good fit for this evil organisation.\"\n\nThe young mans face had begun looking strained from the effort of trying not to look strained. He pulled a wad of papers from the suitcase that rested on his knees, and started to methodically look through them. \n\"I pulled some data from your internal servers. According to this, you haven't actually killed a hero in years. Always letting them go, either by incompetence, or by just... letting them go. I am more then 300% effective than even your top villian. Maybe even yourself.\"\n\nColonel Chaos just looked at the young man with deep, sunken eyes before uttering \"Walk with me.\"\n\nHe got up from his armchair with great effort and grunting, and went for the door. The young man collected his papers and followed. The walk took them through sleek, metal covered corridors. Traditional, but functional.\n\n\"Look son. I built this organisation. Back when I was Lieutenant Chaos. Didn't have Missus Chaos gnagging about blood preassure and cholesterol either.\"\n\nHe slapped his considerable belly with a laugh.\n\n\"No. We don't have many hero kills on record, kid. As a matter of fact, no evil organisation does. Whats your name again son?\"\n\nThe young man looked confused, and he didn't even try to hide it.\n\n\"John.\" He said.\n\n\"And there it is, John. I read your resume. I read your letter. I even read your profile. You are very efficent. Clean.\"\n\n\"Thank you Captai...\"\n\nThe Captain kept talking, ignoring John entierly.\n\n\"You don't monologue. You don't make fatal mistakes. You don't let the heroes get away. Hell, I reckon you don't even tell them your plans.\"\n\n\"No, I find that a bit outdated. Archaic.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you do son.\"\n\nThey entered a large chamber. Brightly lit with two doors in each end of the room. The wall tiles looked white and clean. In the middle of the chamber sat a group of well known heroes and villians around a large conference table.\n\n\"Greetings fellas\" Captain Chaos did a sloppy salute with two fingers and pulled out a chair from the table.\n\n\"Have a seat kid.\"\n\nThe young man was stunned. \n\n\"You let heroes in here? What is this?\"\n\n\"Take. A. Seat.\"\nCaptain Chaos demeanor had changed entierly, and you could see glimpses of the world infamous mastermind through his old eyes.\n\nThe young man complied.\n\nThe Captain bellowed out across the room.\n\n\"The Council is in session!\"\n\nThe young man looked visibly confused and perplexed. He met the eyes of the various villians and heroes. The Captain continued.\n\n\"This is John. Aspiring Villian. This is the young man that killed Mr Amazing and his entire family. One of my dearest friends and many of yours as well.\"\n\nThe Council murmured in agreement.\n\n\"Friends and collegues. Tell me. A villian that kills without remorse, with no respect for the traditions and showmanship we have built over the year, that is efficent above all else, what would you call that villian?\"\n\nThe old hero known as Lightstrike stood up, shaking with anger, and yelled.\n\n\"HE'S A FUCKING SERIAL KILLER.\"\n\n\"Language Lightstrike.\" The Captain interjected. \"But yes. That is correct. You see us villians and heroes have an understanding. Neither of us go too hard, we don't kill eachother. Not on purpose, anyway. That way, we get our companies and syndicates left alone, and the heroes get to keep their status and influence.\"\n\nThe colonel closed in behind the young mans chair.\n\n\"And you see son. We like our status quo. We don't want to... stir the pot.\"\n\nAnd in one swift motion, he snapped the young mans neck backwards, threw him out of the chair, and on to the floor. A panel slid open to reveal a floor mounted furnace, that promptly incinerated the lifeless body.\n\n\"That would be all Gentlemen.\"\n\nThe Colonel nodded to the assembly.\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "The city was awake to the sounds of the sirens wailing all over. Lately this has become pretty much an acceptable affair. The city does have a tendency to shelter all vile and vice afterall, too much to do and so little time left to be always alarmed. Nothing fazed the city's people for long, a pretentiously ignorant breed of mankind. I almost hated it except I had no time for hate of that kind. Consumed as I was in my own venture of picking off the scum that populate this city's populace, I couldn't really judge it's people from a higher ground. Afterall having a higher ground meant you never understood what those beneath felt and thought and hence different easily became scary. I was scared a long time but not so much now. I assimilated easily in this place where I was born and grew up and faced the terrors firsthand. I knew this place better than any of those so called heroes who paraded in their righteousness and who argued and justified all their actions. \n\n\nHeroes. Someone who does what is necessary in times of distress. As simple as that. Liked things simple, plain old me. But the morals went downhill a long time ago. I see distress caused only to be averted at someone's personal behest. To be a hero in times of turmoil after causing a turmoil. After being mediocre enough to be able to save only a few when all should have been saved. Not judgmental, me, but I don't like the taste of these ongoings. Time I took it upon myself to mend a few things here and there.\n\n\nRepaired I always had, and created but most overlooked my inventions over flashier gizmos that were more showbiz than actual function. I didn't care for that I kept at it. Now I have woken up half the people because my inventions have wreaked havoc on some of soceity's most despicable places. The government offices and philanthropic institutions are all under attack. To stop them is easy, find me, ask me to stop, I will. I really will. I had already guessed which so called crusaders will come avenging the city at this juncture. Even if I am 20% wrong I still end up doing good damage to their pantheon. All of my inventions being designed to handle and take care of all those nutjobs. \n\n\n\"You there, halt!\" a deep timbred voice rang behind me. \"Who are you and what are you doing out here when the alarms being going off for almost 20 mins?\" It intoned. \n\n\nAh, Shadow Lurker has found me. Almost missed this one in my calculations. A hermitic one this was. Good guy but not good enough. He had a weakness, his pride in being smarter and deadlier than most in the dark hours. Trouble had found me. \n\n\nI thought about asking him what made him feel so secure so proud in this world full of surprises. What keeps this charade of bravery up. Well, not being a sentimentalist I clicked the button on the inside lapel of my coat under the guise of adjusting it against the cold and made it seem as if  I was going to answer him. I didn't as there was no point in wasting words on dead ears. Belonging to a dead Shadow Lurker who lay with laser holes on the pavement. \n\n\nI turned and made my way towards the safe house as another valiant pillar of soceity gasped on his last breaths. Had to hurry before my dog misses me too much.",

The late night talk shows were the worst. He would grant interviews about his epic battles with this bad guy or that one, share his emotional origin story, and the audience would hang on every word, relishing his confidence, fawning over his chiseled jaw. \n\nNauseating.\n\nMr. Wonderful had dispatched many a villain in his time. Evil doers great and small fell to his overwhelming strength. Murderers, thieves, investment bankers... any who refused to conform to societal norms met their demise, but not before the media arrived to hear his victory speech. You see, Mr. Wonderful had learned how to wield the power of mass opinion as a weapon more potent than any sword or energy beam. No one was safe from the prying eyes of the masses. From the 30\u2019s to about 2045 he even hosted a wildly popular television series, in which family members of petty criminals would betray their erring loved ones to him, and we would all get to watch as he humiliated and executed them. \n\nDespicable. \n\nSuch a sterling public image. A shining example of justice for all to follow. A model citizen, and the kind of guy you bring home to your mom. He was above reproach. Beyond criticism. The kind of guy the world turns to when evil is knocking on its door. \n\nBut I\u2019ve seen his browser history. With the help of a tiny virus planted on his favorite porn site, I\u2019ve come to know every, minute detail of this golden man\u2019s existence. I learned about how he discovered his powers, watched him develop from a well-meaning farm boy to a global phenomenon and social media superstar. Watched him develop a penchant for power and domination. Seen him rape helpless women in his basement. \n\nSo as I stood over his limp, bloodied body, listening to him struggle to beg for his life through trembling lips, the irony of it all dawned on me. A man who lived for the cameras would meet his doom in his own bedroom, with no audience but the stars shining through his windows.  I wanted to confront him, to denounce his sins and listen to his explanations, but as I watched the light fade from his beautiful eyes, I realized that argument was futile. He would never admit to his crimes. Perhaps he truly believed that he had done nothing wrong. With his last gasp, he managed to gurgle something about needing to update his followers, but his words were cut off as I inserted my knife into his occipital lobe. I knew that in about a week, the world would be fawning over a new hero, and no one would remember his name. \n\nPitiful.",

Arriving at the most desired end through the most effective means.  \n\n\nThe philosophy of the Zeth'Kan order was a force that could move mountains. Huang Xile was the embodiment of that philosophy as he strode through the arena. He was chosen as the power-wielder of Zeth'Kan. Wielding that power, he now used it to crush the skull of Shere Yuanshan, champion of the Pan'Thak people. Screams of horror arose from the onlookers as they watched their strongest power-wielder fall in the duel. Or at least Huang Xile calculated that horror would be the most likely sentiment. He could not be sure and would therefore not argue the case.   \n\n\nDropping the limb body of Shere Yuanshan, Huang Xile turned around precisely the moment the rest of the Pan'Thakian power-wielders would be close enough to grasp, yet not close enough to hurt him. The look in their eye changed as he did. Huang Xile estimated it to be due to dismay that their plan had failed. If they had reasoned as he they would have known that it would fail. If they had not split up the power in between all of them they would not have been divided and conquered. If they had reasoned as he they would not build their society upon justice, charity and kindness. If they had reasoned as he their subjective morality would not blind them from the truth.   \n\n\nHuang Xile hoisted the dying breed of power-wielding Pan'Thakians into the air with the power of Zeth'Kan.   \n\n\n\"Monster!\"  \n\n\n\"Slaughterer!\"  \n\n\n\"Fiend!\"  \n\n\nThey cursed at Huang Xile before he ended them with a swat of the hand. The duel had been a necessary means to draw out the Pan'Thak elite. The Zeth'Kan order had agreed that it would be the most efficient way of crushing Pan'Thak resistance was to disarm them of their national fervor and create hopelessness among the populace. Should the champions fall, the brothers had estimated it would take 20-30 years to convert them to Zeth'Kan belief with all other factors accounted for.   \n\n\nHuang Xile watched as the Pan'Thak people fled from the arena. It was well that they had chosen to flee and live rather than to resist and die. The order would need every able hand to work their due to summon Zeth into this world. And with the arrival of Zeth, the Zeth'Kan order would finally know the greatest truth.   \n",

My hand shook as I took another drag. It always shook after a kill.\n\nI've been doing this a long time. I could tell you I think it's necessary, or right, or even just. I could tell you whatever I wanted if I cared to justify myself. If I cared to justify myself, I wouldn't be who I am.\n\nThey've given me a name, not something I care to acknowledge. They have a 5 year old, fuzzy description of me. Nothing near accurate enough to ever pin me down. They call me the \"King of Evil\". I know, ridiculous.\n\nThis city has always had crime. Small time shoplifters, street gangs, various organized crime organizations, even a few \"supervillains\", guys who were effective at what they did and rose to the top. Where you have vermin like the people who live here packed in like so much shit in a tin can there's bound to be corruption and disease. It's human nature, and ultimately, it's why I do what I do.\n\nWhere you have an audience, you have performers. \"Heroes.\" Plenty of these jokers have what they call super powers, abilities that allow them to perform superhuman feats. Strength, telekinesis, flight, that kind of thing.\n\nThe thing about both heroes and villains is that they have egos big enough to choke a city. They're both vampires, and one isn't necessarily worse than the other to me. I've killed both. I've killed a lot more heroes, though. They haven't learned to leave me alone like the villains have. Villains know I'm bad for business. Heroes are performers, and they want all the laurels.\n\nThe weakness all of these charlatans have in common is that they want this compost heap of a city to know their names. Their screen names, anyway. With their constant fighting, it's easy to learn their weaknesses. For most of them it's as simple as a gun.\n\nTonight was something special for me, though. No guns. No hard to acquire materials, no need to learn complex patterns or languages. Tonight I got to strangle a man to death. A man who has been the most offensive of all for as long as I can remember. When investigators find his hard drives the truth will come out, and maybe a few more of these two legged rats will start seeing above the muck and realize we're all kings and glorifying these jesters and sharks is below us.",

Various cities housing and feeding tens of thousands of citizens hum along with flawless efficiency. It's a world without crime. Humanity won the battle against itself.\n\nHe poured a shot of vintage vodka, highly illegal. He doesn't feel a buzz. Tolerance is a bitch. He stares across the city skyline.\n\nIt's also a world without passion, progression, or adventure. Humanity evolved itself into complacency. No more wars to conquer, no more discoveries, no more drive to improve. The exploration of the galaxy ended at Mars. We found an endless supply of clean energy. Our smartest and brightest used it to eradicate greed and selfishness. Somehow along the way we eradicated the human spirit as well.\n\nQuantum computers ended the PC race for more processing power. Everyone sits at home, plugged into a virtual world their great grandkids watched in movies. The mission to Jupiter and Neptune were cancelled. No reason to go. No reason for anything anymore. We lost our drive, our instincts being bred out a little more with each new generation.\n\nDr. Eathan looked at the vial in his hand. It was the last thing humanity discovered...life on another planet. Unfortunately it was a type of virus. One that caused rapid mutations in lab tests.\n\n\"Time to wake up.\" He said softly. He would go down in history as a mass murderer and probably the first terrorist in over a century, but the alternative was far more terrifying - mankind fading into extinction.\n\nOnce released, people would die. Hundreds, thousands, maybe all. \"Unless,\" he said to himself, \"You lazy f**kers wake up and remember what it is to be human. To fight, survive, explore, invent, improve... The cure is on Jupiter. I've run the numbers. If they start right away, we can be there and back in enough time to save 70% of our species... And with any luck, we'll remember that we're explorers, adventurers and will keep pushing ourselves from here to edge of the galaxy.\"\n\nHe never considered himself a villain, but maybe humanity wasn't ready for a world without conflict or without a common enemy...a common goal. Maybe someday we can be driven by pure ambition to better ourselves, but not yet. We still need a reason to push ourselves. He was going to give them purpose. If that made him the villain, so be it.",

If someone tries to stop me from dissassembling their lair, or tries to force me into handing over my newest piece of stolen supertech to the authorities, then i defeat them, plain and simple. No monologe, no ethical debate, no second chances.\n\nYOu get in my way, and you get rekt. No excuses. You have your hand on the self-destruct of your Handwavium-powered superreactor? You'll be dead before you can move a muscle, smartass. Charging your super-heroic friendship-powered ultimate attack? I hope you didn't need your arms, showoff. You want to make a deal? Not interested, go spend the next year in the ICU, dickhead. Etc, etc.\n\nTHis has given me a reputation of sorts, of the \"everyone fears and/or despises me\" variety. Villains are more afraid of me than of any actual hero, and the hero's fear running into me more than they do with their own villains. I'm the guy that cuts your face of mid-monologue.

            "comment": "The dynasty lasted for 500 years.  And for that entire time, we kept the peace.  An endless chain of second sons, married to our service.  And I, I have risen through the ranks to be their commander.  I have put down rebellions.  I have slaughtered babies in cradles.  I have burned harvests and razed villages and salted the earth behind me.  I have carried out the will of the Emperor and the Empress before him.  I believed I would carry out the will of the next Emperor as well, though perhaps that is no longer certain.\n\nThe rebellions gained in frequency.  The harder we came to crush, the faster they rose again.  At court, they say that had the Emperor heeded the wisdom of the old counselor he inherited with his throne, we would not be in this predicament.  Maybe that's true.  We'll never know.  At the Emperor's orders, I killed the old man in his sleep.  And then I sent a detachment to kill his family.  His oldest grandson escaped the slaughter.  But the family's lands and wealth were seized.  All he had left was his grief and his tainted name.  \n\nI asked permission to hunt him down.  Grief and a tainted name so easily turn to a vengeful grudge.  I knew that this man would come back to haunt my Emperor.  But the permission was not granted.  So we put down uprising after uprising.  Sometimes I met the leaders in combat.  Sometimes I didn't.  More and more often, I heard a name at these leaders' lips.  The name of the grandson.\n\nI decided I had to find him.  It turned out, I did not have to look far: he had infiltrated the palace, posing as a stablehand.  And, as one might expect from a man who has led a rebellion from hiding, he himself was careful and perceptive.  He knew he'd been found about as soon as I did and he put his plans in motion.  He sabotaged the Emperor's saddle, causing him to fall from his horse when we rode into an ambush.  My soldiers did what they could to protect our fallen leader, but they were out-numbered.  I was holding him, the grandson of the dead and attainted counselor, in custody when word came that the Emperor had been killed.  He looked into my eyes and smiled.  I looked into his eyes and did the same.  Then I pointed the pistol at his head and pulled the trigger.  And thus both the rebellion and the Emperor died on the same day.\n\nThe Emperor died without issue.  His wife produced two stillborn girls before she died in childbed.  The son she bore that day lived two weeks before following his mother into the afterworld.  He had a sister, who was married off to form an alliance.  She is leading an army now, come to claim her brother's empty throne.  But I am already here, and the Emperor's surviving counselors and our own army has deemed me fit to take up the crown.  And so, in the name of keeping the peace, I will.\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Pride. One of the oft-written about 7 deadly sins. It brings forth images of music icons making sure that everyone who googles them knows how wealthy they are, of world leaders spewing dogma about the greatness of their country ad nauseam, of *many* villains-real and fake- who end up getting killed or captured because they let their ego get to them. Hungras had no such delusions. He knew the power he commanded and he knew just how *fragile* that power was. One slip-up and he was in jail, dead or worse.\n\nThis is what was on his mind when the latest hero kicked down the door to his lair, springing the trap he had meticulously planned out. The door flew off its hinges, perhaps a bit too easily to those paying enough attention. He knew the hero wouldn't notice though. She fought evil men such as himself with her might and relied on her friends for support in the areas she were lacking in. This is why all his other traps were tailored to kill this hero's allies. Made things easier when he would eventually put one, or in this case likely several, bullets in her head. He didn't turn around, trusting the powerful magnets to subtly alter the path of the crumpled door pieces away from his chair and into the walls. As the dust settled, the hero charged into the room, screaming for blood.\n\n\"***Hungras!***\"\n\n\"Yes, what is it? Come to yell my ear off about justice or whatever it is you believe in? Well, make it quick; I have a meeting in 10 minutes and I'd rather not be late.\" That last line was meant to boil the hero's blood further. More anger would mean more mistakes on their end, and an easier kill for Hungras.\n\n\"***You bastard! I'll kill you for what you did! This isn't about the fate of the country or the world anymore! I'm here to pay you back for what you did to me!***\"\n\nHungras yawned. It was a talent he had to develop with much practice. Yawning on command was fairly difficult. The hero hadn't stopped charging down a hallway that whose length she might have questioned had she not been so furious. Again, this was all by design, as the Lightning Turrets needed time to lock onto a target, and *this* hero could move very quickly when she wanted to.   \n\"You know, I'm surprised that you got as far as you did with allies as *stupid* as yours were.\" Hungras replied without turning his chair, amplifying his voice so the hero could hear him over their booming steps. \"You should really be thanking me for ridding you of such a burden.\"\n\nThe hero replied with only two words. \"***Fuck. YOU!***\"\n\n\"Tsk, tsk, tsk.\" Hungras taunted. \"**Language.**\"\n\nHungras only heard screams of range in response. *Well then, its seems as though the bait has been thoroughly set.* He thought to himself as he began to activate the traps that lay below the charging hero. *Now to get on to my meeting.*\n\nHungras tapped away at his screen, his personal display tracking the hero's every movement and displaying them to him. He was known for being cunning and emotionless strategies and takedowns, but this hero seemed to have forgotten all that upon witnessing her fallen friends. The pressure sensors on the floor displayed the hero coming closer and closer until finally, she passed into the fire zone. The turrets had finished charging and locking on by the time the hero got there so as soon as she crossed into the fire zone, all the turrets loosed their charge into her. \n\nHungras could hear the deafening **BOOM** as the bolts of electricity shot from the hidden turrets, passing through the hero's body and frying all of her cybernetic enhancements. Hungras finally turned his chair around to face the hero who had tried to put a stop to his rule who now stood helpless as several hundred thousand volts of electricity passed through her body at multiple points, paralyzing her. Hungras stood up, drew his pistol with his left hand, and had it aimed it at the hero before he took his first step. He emptied the magazine into the hero, his aim aided by the implants in his eyes and the bio-synthetic muscle fibers in his arm and hand.\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\n*BANG.*\n\nAfter firing the last shot of the magazine, he re-holstered the pistol while at the same time, his right hand had finished converting to its piercing form and loading the dose of cyanide. Hungras crouched, allowing the bio-synthetic muscle fibers in his legs and arms to tense up for a moment before lunging at the hero, crossing the 15 meter gap between the two in less than a second and with one stride. Hungras glanced down at his arm, embedded to the elbow in the hero's abdomen. With a thought, he released the cyanide stored up in the cybernetic-handblade into the hero's bloodstream. Over the next few seconds, enough cyanide had entered the hero's body to kill several hundred people. Hungras removed his handblade, shook off the hero's blood, straightened his suit and began to walk towards the exit of the room.\n\nAs he walked, the only sounds in the room were those of his brisk footsteps, the hero dying of 15 gunshot wounds, a large hole in her stomach and the overdosage of cyanide Hungras had just given her and the buzz of the Lightning Turrets that were programmed to not shut off until the hero's brain died and her heart stopped beating. Hungras thought to himself about how he had set up this final encounter.\n\nHe thought of how he had all the food bugged so that he could monitor every member of the population, resistance or not.\n\nHe thought of how he had the Enforcers ramp up the brutality of their methods as to provoke an uprising.\n\nHe thought of how he had spied on the resistance since before its inception.\n\nHe thought of how he had offered patronage to the most promising members of the resistance.\n\nHe thought of how he had warned them that a direct raid on his headquarters was a suicide mission, and that he, Hungras the Viper, killed all who opposed them with cunning and ruthlessness such that they never had a chance.\n\nHe thought of how the heroes never listened to his advice and eventual pleas.\n\nHe thought of how it all ended here, with a one-on-one that was all but decided years beforehand.\n\nHungras thanked his incredible foresight years ago when he had his tear ducts surgically removed. This was his true power, not speed, strength, intelligence, or some special ability that solved all his problems for him. It was his cunning, and boy had it gotten him far.\n\nSomewhere deep down, he wished it hadn't.\n\nAs he neared the exit, he tapped the transmitter on his collar and spoke to his assistant. \"Giles, could you please turn on the incinerators *after* I leave the room and let the Anxlari know that I will be on time to our meeting?\" He paused for a moment as Giles confirmed his request. \"Thank you Giles.\" \n\n*Please let the next ones be better than this group.* He thought to himself. *They* ***need*** *to be better than I if they are to have any hope of defeating the Anxlari. Those bastards are even more ruthless than I am, and they would have razed the entire planet years ago had I not been able to trick them into letting me do it.*\n\nHungras would have cried then, but he was unable. That, and he had a meeting to get to and it would be rude to keep his clients waiting.\n\n*Hopefully, one day there will be a hero strong enough to save us all from this.* Hungras thought as he exited the room, hearing the incinerators ignite as the doors closed behind him.  \n",

I would found much later about the pigeons.\n\nMy first  instructions were clear, they contained a dossier of all my life  from the cradle till the day the letter was written. They somehow knew I had worked as a snipper agent for over 25 years. A lot of my army missions were classified, but somehow this Princip person(s) knew them all. \n\nThe first task was simple: \"We know about you, what you must know about us is that we strive to change the world. Once a member, always a member. Dissidence and treason are punishable by death, quick death. Would you like to join us?\"\n\nI followed their contact instructions and ever since then I ocasionally receive new tasks.\n\nTasks are not optional, the Princip rely on me. On my expertise. I see myself as a valued member of a team with unique skills, and I thinks that's how they see me.\n\nMy first tasks was the CEO of a company notorious for privatizing water sources. I took down two of the board members and their CEO the same night. Its funny that the media didnt really cover the killings. We like it like that cause that's how we know they are scared, the people who know about the high profile level assassinations don't wanna make a fuzz about it.\n\nI am one of a few who are tired of a corrupt system. Some may think we are evil, but the way I see it, we've rid earth of some of the most despicable men, they are almost always old men, but there are other as well.\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "The warming of cold steel in my hand makes me think of ice cream. I couldn't tell you why, I can only tell you that that's where my mind wanders to when a situation reaches this point. This exact point is me, Orin, standing here in the desert, pistol in hand and holding it to temple of Rize Righteous. \n\nDespite this immediate threat to his life, Mr Righteous' attention is actually fixated on the figure pacing somewhat triumphantly in front of him: the purple trenchcoat donned, curly-moustache'd and sinister figure of Bad Brinn the Bastard. Brinn briskly moves from right to left in front of our captive, arms waving in a mad fashion as he adds physical theatrics to the extremely long and not particularly clever monologue he's been performing for some time now. \n\nThe reveal is probably one of the things he likes the most about his job as a villain which I think it fitting as his outfit makes him look like a cross between Captain Hook and a magician. By now, the gun in my palm is completely warm and I'm thinking of just how sticky my hand would be if I happened to be holding an ice cream in this desert instead. \n\n\"You see, you _\"heroes\"_ seem to think you run this town but I.. I, Bad Brinn, am here to prove that the very opposite is true.\" I've tuned in again on what's happening immediately around me. It was an accident, yet now surprised to note that Brinn doesn't use \"the Bastard\" part of his evil moniker. I wonder why that is? Maybe I just made it up, I'm not sure. He and I have been together for nine months now and, before that, I knew of him as Bad Brinn the Bastard. It never really occurred to me that he never called himself that. \n\n\"For far too long you and your band of do-gooders have been doing good wherever you see fit but the time has come for the real owners of the night to take the streets back.\" Bad Brinn was getting the climax of his speech, I could tell by the way he had slowed his pacing down to meet the beads of sweat gathering on his forehead. Fitness and stamina was not his strong point, though neither I nor Rize Righteous were likely to complain. \n\n\"You'll never get away with this, Bastard!\" cried Mr Righteous, chest puffed out and eyes ablaze with defiance. As he jerked forward to give Brinn a piece of his mind, the barrel of my gun never left his side. He wasn't likely to do much - his hands were bound tightly behind him and he was knelt upon his bright, yellow cape. Even if he tried to stand up, he'd fall down. I wasn't concerned. \"The League of Light will catch wind of your devious scheme and put a stop to you and your henchmen!\" \n\n\"You mean these guys?\" Brinn was positively beaming, like a game show host announcing a twist that was sure to defeat the show's contestants. From beneath his purple trench coat he pulled out four photographs. He tossed them in the dirt in front of Rize Righteous, cackling like a witch as the hero's face fell to despair. \n\n\"No.. They can't.. This can't be!\" I felt a pang of sympathy for Mr Righteous. He didn't see this coming at all. Before him lay four scenes that captured the deaths of his League of Light family; Lizzy Liberty, Captain Cooperation, Win-speration and The Truth. All images taken by Brinn at the exact time in which my gun went off. Rize's eyes rose from the photos to Brinn who had, like clockwork, produced a polaroid camera from his trench. Bad Brinn was grinning ear to ear and looking to me expectantly. I pulled the hammer back on my pistol as Rize closed his eyes. \n\n**BANG!**\n\nA few wisps of smoke snake their way outwards and upwards from bullet sized hole in the camera Bad Brinn the Bastards held in front of his chest. His face is one of disbelief, he was on such a high. I feel sorry for him too but, really, he was a puppet. Brinn slumps to his knees, blood flowing from the gunshot wound, as I collect up the photos of dead League of Light heroes. I can hear him gasping a bit for words but I'm carefully placing a lighter to the photos and watching them catch fire. \n\n\"You.. shot him.\" Now I can't tell who is more surprised; Brinn or Mr Righteous.\n\n\"Yes.\" I reply, letting the flaming photos fall to the dirt and tumble away in the slight breeze. \n\n\"Are you helping me?\" \n\n\"No.\" \n\n**BANG!** \n\nRize Righteous joins the fate of his friends and that of his foe, Bad Brinn, as I turn my back on the desert sunset and make for a getaway vehicle. Before I peel off down the road to find an ice cream store, I carefully pull a notebook and pen from my jacket pocket, opening it to the back page where a list of US cities and their heroes and villains are written. Some have been crossed off, like Denver and it's Defenders of the Devout or New York and the Night King. My pen runs a thick red line through the League of Light and Bad Brinn the Bastard. One less group of people thinking they're special. \n\nThe engine roars into life as the last tendrils of light slink back across the desert horizon. The headlamps fix on the road ahead and I circle my next destination; Ike Iceman and the Indiana Invincibles. ",

You aren\u2019t fitting the stereotype. You\u2019re supposed to tie up the hero, monologue, reveal your plan and give them chance to escape. They undo your plan but don\u2019t kill you, thus maintaining the higher moral ground, and in turn give you chance to retreat and devise another scheme. At the end of the day, neutrality is maintained. Understand? You offing them as soon as you get chance is upsetting this finely tuned balance that has taken a few years to develop.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cLook Smith, it\u2019s not my fault they went to the Mickey-Mouse school of Do-gooders. Christ, Sparkly Bangers was quite literally that! Did she really expect that glittery corset to protect her from a headshot! It\u2019s not my fault you\u2019ve got a bunch of incompetent \u2018Heroes\u2019 running around. I fully intend to take advantage of that until one of them actually gives me a challenge. Most of the Villains you\u2019ve got here are nothing more than school bullies trying to steal lunch money. Keynote tried to drop a Piano on me last week, I saw that a mile off as he pushed it off the building. Quite frankly it\u2019s ridiculous.  All your heroes are soft and the rest of the villains are little better. What happened to the good old days when Villains were Villains and a grand scheme wasn\u2019t something Wiley Coyote could have dreamt up! \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cMr Jones, I understand, I really do. But could you tone it down a little. I\u2019m sure in time a Hero equal to you will come along, but until then you\u2019re making several Governments twitchy. You're a decent villain, keep your head down, play by the rules for a few years and you could make it to the top. I'm sure a Super-Villain somewhere will notice you and recruit you into their organisation. Rush things, upset the applecart so to speak and well, it could upset this careful system some of us have spent so long cultivating\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cNo Smith. I won\u2019t. I didn't stay late at Evil Elementary practising my evil laugh. I studied all the old fights, read countless news articles, watched fight footage again and again. I worked my ass off to become top of my class. To be honest with you it was easy and now I'm here there's no competition. It's like that school was deliberately useless.  I\u2019m going to become the greatest Villain of my generation while it\u2019s easy pickings.\u201d\n\nBANG\n\nMr Jones sat slumped in his chair, the look on his face didn\u2019t even show the surprise that had briefly crossed his mind when Smith had drawn the gun.\n\n\u201cPity\u201d said Smith, holstering the pistol.",

While yes, I was far more powerful than them, I\u2019d rather sit back in a coffee shop and drink a cappuccino.\n\nThat was how I acted for years, but, it came to a point when heroes were considered special, everyone\u2019s favourite hero was Ohm, he had his own cereal, his own national holiday, hell, people wanted autographs of him more than they wanted autographs of an actual *good* celebrity.\n\nI decided that its time for powered individuals to be put in check. I started planning months in advance, due  to me having pure natural Elegy (the power that superheroes and villains were bestowed upon over 40 years ago) it was an easy task.\n\nOn the National Holiday for Ohm, I staged a bank robbery, I controlled 5 criminals to attack a measly bank near where Ohm was. I knew he\u2019d arrive to make himself look good, my predictions were correct, he arrived in 57 seconds and 73 milliseconds flat. \n\nI watched as he zapped the criminals, punched them through walls and knocked them out, then I burst through the roof, my armour didn\u2019t even have a scratch.\n\n\u201cAh, let me guess, a villain. Trying to kill me, go on with your monologue about how you\u2019re the most powerful villain and you have me in your grasp and then I simply knock you unconscious.\u201d He started to laugh, along with civilians who watched from the sidelines.\n\u201cOh you\u2019re not speaking? That\u2019s a pity, your armour makes you look like you\u2019d do a great monologue.\u201d\n\nOhm started to walk away, he thought I was weak, but I wasn\u2019t. I fired a rope like beam from my hand and wrapped it around his neck, he went to grab it to try tear it off, but it simply cut his hands in two. With one small pull, I ripped his head from his body.\n\n46 years of heroes, and I was the first to kill one.\n\nThey call me a villain, but just because I\u2019m exterminating the heroes, doesn\u2019t mean I am. I\u2019m a saviour. ",

Bottomline, Dr. Unbelievable has to die.\n\nI followed him home one rainy evening to discover that he is literally a doctor. Lab coat, stethoscope, the whole nine yards. I also found out where he practices medicine. For a \"superhero\", he is very easy to track down. He doesn't have super powers or anything. That isn't a real thing, however he does have a Batman style arsenal of weaponry and gadets that he boasts about every chance he gets. I hate vigilantes.\n\nHis wife and kids we very easy to restrain. I wasn't going to kill them, I'm not a monster. I just make money in a uniquely criminal way. He should be home soon and I've been growing impatient.\n\nThe door know turned slowly, he must has senced something was up. Maybe the wife should have texted, maybe he's astute to criminal activity, after all, he is a hero. He crept into the living room to see his tied up family and unfortunately for him, myself holding a pistol. \n\n\"Who are yo-\" his sentence was ended abruptly with the impact of a bullet entering his skull. \"Unbelievable\" I chuckled as I left his home. He should have kept his day job.",

They have passed on me for the third straight fucking year. Does a man not deserve to be compensated according to his efforts? I deserved it. Fuck.\"\n\n\"Need a refill?\", Wolf was already experienced in dealing with Death Walker's ranting episodes by now. He took pleasure in seeing the normally sombre and sincere Death rant and complain like a child.\n\n\"I met all the targets and more, I cut down on medical costs, we even saw an increase in revenue in my area after I had exterminated those pesky heroes. I have been saving the council so much money but do they reward me? No, instead I am told that I lack the necessary experience for the position. That I am not ready for it yet. They promoted that idiot Wraith. The same guy that got his ass handed to him by some stupid kids with a super dog. Can you fucking believe it?\"\n\n\"Another refill please\", Wolf called out to the bartender. He looked at the face of his companion. A chiselled handsome face that would not look out of place on cover of magazines, if not for the hollow eye sockets where resided flames as dark as night, flickering occasionally showing emotion that betrayed Death's poker face.\n\nWolf did not know a lot about Death\u2019s history. He had met this young villain four or five years back and by that time Death had already made a name for himself. He had killed almost all the heroes present in his assigned section, destroyed the regional headquarters of the \u2018Superhumans for Humans Federation\u2019 and effectively erased the presence of SfHP from his area altogether.\n\nThe council did not like his methods. Death was a threat to their old ways. He procured Death\u2019s performance review but could not bring himself to show it to him. He had quite enjoyed the review and the choice comments made on Death\u2019s accomplishments and activities.\n\n\u201cKilled the captured hero immediately without explaining his grand plan. Completely illogical.\u201d\n\n\u201cExecuted a plan in complete secrecy. Did not give the federation even a small hint about the scheme. Cannot understand the reason behind his actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cUses extremely simple tools. Did not even touch the convoluted contraptions budget. Something is wrong with this man.\u201d\n\nA smirk appeared on his face remembering the comments. He looked at his companion again. This man would lead them to greatness. The Council needed change and Wolf had decided that, he would pave the way for it.",

I keep walking by the time I find who i'm looking for my bottle is already empty.\n\nHe doesn't notice me. In one movement i rush forward throwing the empty bottle into the back of his head. IT smashes apart and cuts his mask. Before he can turn around I pull out my knife and complete the cut on his mask. blond hair, neatly combed. He spins around and cracks my rib with his fist. I go flying into a wall. Another 2 breaks. \n\n\"You!\" his mask falls off his face. mid 30's, brown eyes. Square jaw.

He's fast, maybe even as fast as me. I'll note this for later.\n\n\"I've broken out 9 times before, whats different now.\"\n\nIt doesn't take long for him to get me back to the police station.

The sun poured into the bedroom, a warm cascade of light. The heat felt marvelous on my skin.\n\nAs every morning, once my eyes had gotten used to the light, the view took my breath away: the bay and the gorgeous city spread below me, the trees of the estate surrounding House swaying softly in the breeze, the three large pools shining under the sun, the beautiful paths winding through the flower bushes. \n\nA picture of perfection. A picture of peace.\n\nFor the past three years, except for brief trips to countries far and wide, my home. My own personal prison. My covent. My retreat.\n\nThe HUD integrated in the panoramic window flashed \"7:00 AM\". As every morning, I was supposed to put on my sports clothes, climb to the roof, meditate and do yoga for half an hour or so before coming back down to take a shower and a light breakfast.\n\nBut not this morning. This morning would be kill or be killed.\n\nThere was a 98.2% chance they would strike before yoga, believing I would still be somewhat asleep in the early hours of the morning. They were wrong.\n\nThere was also a 89% chance they would strike from three different directions at once. Suddenly, I felt alive, energized. The hunt was on.\n\nThe HUD displayed \"7:01 AM\". I said: \"House, open the window, please\". This is also something I did every morning. I was keeping to the script. I needed them to believe they were going to catch me by surprise. The salty breeze poured into the bedroom, like the sun before it, feeling so fresh on my skin.\n\nThe HUD displayed \"7:02 AM\". And right, under it, in bright red letters: \"INCOMING\". Gorgon vibrated in my pocket, a long angry signal. War.\n\nI saw her at that exact moment: an elongated flash of gold, a display of raw, unadulterated power. I thought: \"Able to leap a building in a single bound\". I carefully took three steps back, forcing my breath to stay calm, willing my heart to beat slowly, focusing on the air entering my body through the nose and exiting my lungs through the mouth.\n\nIn a flash, she flew through the window, and landed right in front of me. LadyWolf.\n\nI caught my breath. She was God.\n\nImagine a body as close to perfection as possible, clad in a thin uniform of blue and gold. Long red hair cascading down her back, all the way down to her upper thighs. Her masked face revealed nothing but eyes so green, and that famous lock of hair going down her left temple.\n\nI was in awe. Her entire body seemed clad in unstoppable limitless energy (and, according to my intel, that was pretty close to the truth). At that very moment, I wanted to be her, to touch her, to drag her to my bed and make love to her, to prostrate myself at her feet, wash them with my tears and confess my sins.  All at the same time.\n\nAnd then she pointed a single finger at me and said, in a voice as sweet as the most beautiful angel, as harsh as the just GOD that she was: \"Mastermind! Your reign of terror is over!\".\n\nMy legs turned to jelly, my mouth dry and parched. I was going to faint, to scream, to run, to hide. I did not have any chance, I was lost, as good as dead. Gorgon vibrated once.\n\nLadyWolf pulled back her hand in surprise, grabbed the side of her neck. A sharp intake of breath through her mask. It was too late.\n\nShe collapsed gracefully, as gorgeous, irresistible, in death as she had been in life.\n\nI drew a long, ragged breath. Her body, its long legs slightly bent at the knees, a marble statue clad in gold and blue, her amazing hair an almost round sun on my bedroom floor. \n\nI knew that, invisible under her perfect hand, there was a single, microscopic, black dot on her neck. Five years.  Five years, and ten times as many million dollars, to devise this: a silent, hypersonic projectile, able to pierce her perfect skin and inject the most poisonous compound known to man. The only thing able to kill beings from her home planet. In a quarter of a second, before her hand had even reached her neck, she was dead.\n\nI had no time to recuperate. Gorgon was, again vibrating like crazy. My second guest was there. My eyes shifted to the HUD. It still said \"7:02 AM\". Under the clock: \"ALERT\".",

            "comment": "\"So, Sarah, you have something for me?\" \n\n\"Yes, Senator. I've found a government office that spends tens of millions of dollars a year and hasn't produced anything meaningful since it was founded in 1982.\"\n\nSenator Dombrowski looked hard at this serious-faced young woman. She'd only been working in the office for six months now. Former military, or was it CIA? Not important: if she'd really found what he was looking for, he could ride it all the way to a shot at the presidency. \"What's the name of the department?\"\n\n\"It's called the Federal Honey Reserve Office, but-\"\n\nSarah paused. The Senator had frozen the instant he'd heard the name of the office. \"Are you okay, sir?\"\n\n\"Have you spoken about this to anyone else? Have you been in touch with anyone about this? Anyone at all? An office clerk, an archivist, anyone?\"\n\n\"Nobody, sir. I located it myself. I've been tracking figures through Excel files, databases and paper budget submissions for two months to make sense of it.\"\n\nThe Senator leaned back in his chair and let a hand move slowly to the hidden revolver in the armrest. \"Data analysis isn't your thing -  you worked on interrogations in the field, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Could you tell me about them?\"\n\n\"No, sir. It was classified work.\"\n\n\"Sarah, I'm a United States senator, and the ranking Democrat on the defence subcommittee. I order you to tell me about them.\" Hand around the grip. Thumb silently pushing the safety off.\n\n\"Sir, I don't care if you're the President. It was classified work, and unless it's declassified I have no intention of breathing a word about it.\" Fingers relaxing. Hand coming back up to rest empty on the Senator's knee.\n\n\"Sarah, we can't use the honey reserve fund. Not because you were wrong: I'm genuinely astounded that you managed to find it at all. It exists and spends all that cash alright, but not on honey. It has three employees and they're all paid an unbelievable amount of money.\"\n\n\"What do they do, sir?\"\n\nThe Senator leaned forward. \"At this point, you have a choice. You can forget about that question and about the Federal Honey Reserve Fund, and keep doing your job. I don't doubt you'll do a superb job, and in a couple of years you'll either become a policy director for a think tank or take a high-paying role in a defence corp. Or I tell you the answer, and you become one of the most powerful people in the US government, but you will never be permitted to leave the job until you retire.\"\n\n\"Sir, I don't think you'll be able-\"\n\n\"Sarah, trust me: once I tell you the answer, you'll never be allowed to leave government work. There are exceptions for public office like with me, but if I'm ever voted out I'm expected back at my old desk the following Monday. Not that I'd want to do anything else: even being a US senator sometimes feels like a step down from what I used to do.\"\n\nSarah took a deep breath. \"I'm in.\"\n\n\"The Federal Honey Reserve Fund is an assassination team that takes care of people with superpowers.\"\n\n\"Sir, with all due respect, I don't appreciate being made a fool of. If you-\"\n\n\"Sarah, in late 1981 a paranoid gunman teleported into the Oval Office and killed three people before a Secret Service agent put a bullet in his head. That night, Ronald Reagan authorised the creation of an office whose only task was to identify and kill any superpowered individuals. They're too dangerous to leave alive - what happens when some idiot telepath starts  trying to control people's minds, or when some rage monster explodes through downtown New York? Right now only three known superhumans are left alive - a sociopath who can turn himself invisible, an impossibly strong woman who's frightened by her own capabilities, and a narcoleptic teenager who sees the future in her dreams. They're the three employees at the honey reserve, and we pay them extremely well to make sure no more of their kind appear.\"\n\n\"Jesus. How many of these - superhumans - appear each year?\"\n\n\"About one a month. We have a small team working with the notes from the narcoleptic's dreams to identify outbreaks before they happen.

She'd been working towards this for a decade ever since she's first wondered why nobody else was able to see possible futures like she was. The narcoleptic clairvoyant might be trouble, but disjointed dreams were no match for being able to view thousands of outcomes at a time.\n\nThis was the next step on the path to the summit of the mountain .",

But he took to it too well, the killing. I suppose I should start at the beginning.\n\nI\u2019m a demon. I possess people willing to make a deal with me. My problem is once I possess someone, I can\u2019t leave until they die. But my power burns out a human\u2019s body in a matter of weeks, maybe months if they\u2019re strong. In exchange, I give them the ability to get away with whatever they want. They become essentially invisible, as if they didn\u2019t exist, forgotten as soon as you turn away. I become a voice in their ear, feeding off the death of their soul as I convince them to do more and more evil. At least, that\u2019s what I used to do.\n\nMy current host agreed immediately. I should have been concerned about his eagerness, but it had been months since I last fed, so I was a little desperate. It normally took me a little while to talk them into performing even one murder. But, this time, we stareted immediately. We killed 7 people in a week and I was delighted. My power kept us from being caught, but his meticulous nature made it almost unnecessary.  It was almost as if he were prepared to kill at a moments notice. I was elated, I was more full than I had been in centuries. But then...it escalated. It went from one per day to two, then three. And he wasn\u2019t burning out, he was getting stronger.\n\nWhen times get bad for a demon, we can usually exert full control over our host. It takes a lot of our energy to do it, but I had been well fed over the last few months, so I was confident that I could do it. I will never forget what he told me. \u201cYou are mine. You have no power over me. And you will do what I command. Now shut up, and keep us hidden.\u201d I was forced down, unable to speak, unable to exert any sort of influence, save my obscurity. \n\nWe kill without purpose, without mercy, and yet I just want to die. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of lives, the number of heroes that try to find the killer. Each one has met with death by our hands. Other demons have even tried to find me, but I can\u2019t drop my obscurity field, even for them. We walk past each other, and I am powerless to reach out. Even this diary is pointless. I have written thousands like it, and you remember none of them. That is the only reason he lets me write them. Each time he tells me \u201cWrite another one. Maybe this time it will be different.\u201d I have just enough control of his body to write, but it never matters. They are always forgotten as soon as you finish reading it. I have done this thousands of times over the centuries we have been together. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, videos, every conceivable media, and no one remembers.\n\nHe grows stronger with every life he takes, and I don\u2019t need to feed anymore, his life force sustains me.

Walls broke as bodies flew into them. Cries of pain echoed the city as the mad villain tortured the brave hero. The triumph look of the hero's face as he broke free and saved the city.  \n\nBut now? When I'm here? It is a much more, quick, fight.  \n\nI walk with the crowd, all rushing to meet Captain Amazing. The excited chatter of one thousand men, women and children echo across the buildings and back towards me. I hear the gushing of teenage girls, hoping that he would pick them up in his arms and fly away in them. I see little children pulling their parents arm, hoping that it will make them see him faster.  \n\nAs the crowd streams towards the city square, where he will make his grand appearance on the lush green grass, I instead duck into a slim, barely noticeable dark alley. I grab the hidden duffel bag I had packed the night before and check its contents. One disassembled CheyTac Intervention, 10 rounds of .408 Chey Tac ammunition filled into one clip. I would only need one bullet, the rest is insurance in case his friends decide to make a visit. \n\nI climb on top of the old, green dumpster and jump towards the stairwell. The old, rusty metal creaks as it takes my body and I start walking up the metal staircase.  \n\nI assemble the well kept sniper and load a bullet into its chamber. I wait for his grand appearance. 1 minute passes, it then turns into 2, then, 5 then at the 10 minute mark, the is a deafening sound as the sound barrier breaks and he lands on the ground. \n\n\\_drama queen\\_ I thought as I aimed down the scope. I see him raise his right hand and begin a long monologue about law and justice.  \n\n\"Very ironic coming from a vigilante,\" I said to no one. I adjust my scope slightly and begin slowing down my breathing. Like I had practised thousands of times, I waited for my heart beat to go past, and I pulled the trigger.  \n\nCaptain Amazing fell to the floor. It is a bit hard to stand when your brain has imploded. No one can't believe what has happened. The world is silent as they accept the hard truth and begin shouting and crying.  \n\nThe time of egoistic villains has come and gone. The time of epic fights billing millions of dollars has come and gone. The time of idealistic heroes has come and gone. The time of proper villains had begun.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease criticise and help me with formatting and other things. I would like to get better at this",

            "comment": "\"So what, you gonna monolog about your motive and stuff?\" Ring-Lord smiled bitterly at me, while I pointed his own sword at his chest.\n\n\"To take out the hero wannabes like you.\" I told him simply as I pushed his sword into his chest.\n\nThey called him Frodo, the guy who could turn invisible. Running around the city, taking out bank robbers and other supervillains, normal superhero stuff. The civilians would call him a hero.\n\nBut I wouldn't. I knew his true face. He did all that not to actually save lives, or to preserve justice in this world. He did it for fame, for the praise he would receive whenever he went out to public. I'd seen people like him on my travels from my home planet to earth, and yes, I despised them. \n\nI heard clapping from behind me as I stepped back from Ring-Lord's lifeless body. I turned around to find Ray, your average clich\u00e9 Italian mob leader. \n\n\"Wow. Thanks. I've been trying to kill that guy for years.\" He said to me. \n\nI shot him a glare, and his clothes caught fire instantly. He ran away screaming. He wouldn't survive for long, I knew. I never liked that guy. His ego was bigger than even the baobab trees growing back on my home planet. Working with the idiots they call \"supervillains\" would surely be the last thing I do during my time on this planet. I've seen real heroes, and real villains as well. Those two were nothing. \n\nI've killed five of the strongest \"heroes\" by now. The civilians loved them, I didn't.\n\nBrainlock. Sociopath. Sadist. I remembered snapping his neck in his own telepathic dimension. His ability to attack my mind was strong, but he overestimated it. He'd rather watch a man burn to death than save him. And I despised him.\n\nMach. Thief. Pickpocket. I pumelled her with a single punch, such that her own speed killed her. She was fast, running faster than bullets and all. I'd seen her power, and I understood that she was too fast for the naked human eye to see. Pity she abused this power, running about in shops and commiting petty theft. The police couldn't stop her, but I could.\n\nAthena. Gambling addict. I don't care how good she was at calculating her chances of success in a roulette spin, she was gambling away the money that could've been used to send her daughter to school. Also, since she was such a genius, inventing telekinesis gauntlets and jetpack boots, when I smashed her with that van she really should've seen it coming.\n\nBoulder. Videogame addict. He could grow some sort of rock-symbiote inside him to become Boulder, a big, rocky... beast that tore through steel like paper and tossed around cars like tennis balls. But when I ripped him out from his rock-body, he was a simple, ordinary human being too addicted to online games to go out there, get a job and earn some money to send his daughter to school.\n\nI could imagine Athena and Boulder's relationship to be much more pleasant before I came to this planet. They probably used to be a loving couple back then, not the pair one could here screaming at each other in the bedroom from miles away at night. I'd seen couples like them before. I truly felt sorry for Stacy, their 8-year-old daughter. For now she'd stay at an orphanage. Who knows. Maybe I'd raise her to be my apprentice someday.\n\nAnd now Ring-lord.\n\n\"Phantom\" I muttered under my breath. Alcoholic. She'd keep going to the same bar every night, get drunk, and wait for her husband to come and pick her up. I pity that man, partially because he had to let most of his salary go to his wife's drinking habits. Phantom was still alive, but I'd corner her someday and use her phasing-through-objects ability against herself somehow. Maybe after her death, he husband would pick up whatever he had and come at me, trying to avenge his drunkard of a wife.\n\nI wouldn't fight him, actually. He was Splintershaft, and he was unlike the other \"heroes\". He was noble. He fought not for fame or money, but to preserve justice in this mess of a world. I'd sit down and have a nice little talk with him someday. A true man of honor, he was. \n\nOf course, even with his enhanced reaction speed, machine guns, shotgun, titanium sword and martial arts, he wouldn't stand a chance against me. But I wouldn't try to kill him.\n\nAnd Hades. God knows who that guy is. They said he could actually beat me, so I'm interested to see who this person might be, and why he didn't step in when I first became a threat to this world.\n\nBut that was enough hero-hunting for now. About time I took out some of the egoistic supervillains on this planet. Because I despised them as much as those heroes. I walked over to Ray's burning body, and thought about my next move. After some thought I swung my red scarf around my neck, and moved on. I'd go for Cowboy next.",

Prepare yourself for yo- Agh!\"\n\nThe sound of a bullet piercing through yet another so called 'hero' is one that I seem to hear almost regularly. The look of utter shock in their righteous faces, as they crumble to the ground doesn't haunt me as much as it used to when I started in this shit. \n\nThey never considered that I would be so.... tasteless.\n\nSure, it does seem fitting that I let them deliver their speech or give one of my own when I have them tied up in my warehouse, but all of it is just so... inefficient. So theatrical. Even when I'm executing hostages when they have lost their purpose to me, it just doesn't make sense to ramble.\n\nWhy waste words on ears that will hear for the last time? It's much easier to put on between their eyes, now isn't it?\n\nIt is probably this thought process of mine, that has led to the 2 mil bounty on my head. Ah well, as long as they keep the speeches coming, they'll find killing me quite the task.\n\nAnd so, as I hear the sounds of my henchmen being slaughtered one by one violently, a somewhat frequent occurrence given the incomoeti of my crew, I sigh deeply and await my new 'rival'.\n\nLeaning on my desk, I watch the body of my office guard fly across the doorway, riddled with holes. A bald man in a suit enters my office his dual Barettas pointed squarely at me. Unfazed, I close my eyes looking down, expecting the oh so familiar half confident ramble, as I place my hands in the desk behind me. \n\nI was greeted instead by two sharp piercing pains in my abdomen, forcing my eyes open in surprise and shock. His steely glare was agonizing even more. Feeling my stomach, I look at my hands, now coated with my own blood.\n\nI couldn't help but smile. This should be interesting.",

You probably know about me, but if you don't, that doesn't matter, either.\n\nAgainst my better judgement, I published this story anonymously to the internet because my girlfriend wanted me to. She's the only person I really care about, so, well... yeah... publishing this.\n\nI never gave myself a supervillain name. If you're good enough, the public will give you one or maybe even several that will stick, but giving one to yourself is just pretentious.\n\nMost people call me the Grey Man. It's kind of stupid, and an unnecessary allusion to Robert Jordan, but I'm fine with it, and it's what stuck.\n\nI am a ghost, a superhuman who is, to varying degrees, unaffected by the powers of other supers. My powers are so strong that I can negate the defensive powers of my fellow supers just by shooting them with a gun, often to... messy results.\n\nI once let my powers get to my head.\n\nI was seventeen, and I needed the money, so I decided to rob a bank. I'd used my powers to pick fights with arrogant supers before (and once knifed one who thought his powers gave him the right to try to take a guy's girlfriend away from him, even though she wasn't interested; yes, the same girlfriend I still have today), but this was my first step down the path of true supervillainy.\n\nIt was a Tuesday in early October, cold, dark, and cloudy.\n\nI, shall we say, \"borrowed\", my narcissistic, abusive alcoholic of a mother's glock and used my neighbor's hijab (yes, I asked her for it. She hadn't worn it since she moved out of her dad's place and I paid her fifteen dollars for it anyways), a handkerchief, and a pair of mirrored sunglasses as my disguise.\n\nI walked all the way down to the bank. I got a couple odd looks due to my costume, but most people probably assumed I was just another wasted wannabe superhero from some poor white trash neighborhood (the poor part was correct, but we actually had a surprising amount of diversity, as evidenced by my neighbor having a hijab).\n\nIt was a long way, and I was sweaty all over and dead tired by the time I got there. Still, I soldiered on. I was confident in my powers and determined to strike it rich, no matter the cost.\n\nI burst into the bank, taking the glock out of the plastic bag.\n\n\"Give me all your goddamn money!\" I shouted, waving the handgun menacingly at the tellers.\n\n\"W-what?\" One of them, a perky-looking blonde I actually got to know later, and who my girlfriend absolutely *loathes,* asked.\n\n\"No bullshit!\" I shouted \"Give me all the fucking money you can fit in this bag! As many hundreds as you can find! Now, dumbass!\"\n\nWhile they started desperately scraping up as many Benjamins as they possibly could, I made a mistake.\n\nWell, several. but I was a kid who had no idea what he was doing. This was just the worst one, the one that screwed me over.\n\nIn my egotism, I actually began to *want* to have a fight. I *wanted* someone to call on a superhero on me so I could curb-stomp him and gain instant notoriety.\n\nSo, when I noticed a guy calling 911, I let him, instead of shooting the bastard like I should have if I had any amount of common sense.\n\nThey were just handing me back my paper bag, full to the brim with hundred dollar bills, when the cops arrived. Not a superhero, *the cops*.\n\nStill, being an idiotic little boy, I thought my ultra jacked-up superpower immunity somehow protected me from *bullets*. Mundane, ordinary, *completely non-superpower-related lead bullets*.\n\nSo, I turned my gun on them, instead of running like fuck.\n\nLuckily for me, this was a nice part of town, and they weren't me to actually fight back against the *fucking police* unless I had super-powerful superpowers (Which I kind of did have, but not the kind that would actually help me), so actually trying to fight them caught them off guard and scared the absolute shit out of them, like Ungern-Sternberg's cavalry charges against machine gun fire.\n\nI was fucking stupid back then, but, on the plus side, I was a crazy mothefucker. I killed three of them before any of them got of a single shot, despite, at that point, being woefully inexperienced with a handgun.\n\nIt's when they started firing back that the trouble began. A few bullets whizzed past me, marking the last few seconds of my egotistical delusions of invincibility. Then one caught me right in the eye.\n\nI don't know how I survived. It should've gone right into my brain and killed me, but I guess luck was on my side that day or something. I kept shooting with the hand holding the gun, while the hand holding the money bag was held up to my eye, trying to block the blood flow.\n\nI was careful not to get any blood on the precious contents of the bag.\n\nI fled behind the desk, where the bank tellers were busy getting the hell out of dodge. I reloaded the glock, then continued firing.\n\nThen, I ran out of bullets. There were still hundreds of panicked customers in the bank, some of which were injured. My desperate, panicked mind came up with an idea...\n\nI threw my mother's glock at the security camera, which was surprisingly close to me. It hit, and it completely shattered the camera, doing a lot better than I hoped.\n\nThen, I took the hijab, handkerchief, and the shattered remains of the sunglasses off. And my gloves for good measure. I hid the bag of money under my shirt, ran out into the crowd when I was pretty sure nobody was looking, and pretended to be a rather fat injured bystander while the police searched the building.\n\nOnce I got a few blocks away, I took the bag out of my shirt and ran like hell.\n\nA new supervillain came to town the next day, and the entire bank robbery incident was forgotten (though my mother did ask where her gun was and beat me with a stick when I told her I didn't know. She didn't even notice the missing eye thing), but I used to still be very surprised that I actually got away with it.\n\nThen I remembered that the Stupidinator's powers could make people stupid, scatter-brained, and extremely unlucky. I, of course, was immune, so I couldn't blame him for my stupid actions, though.\n\nDidn't stop me from killing him. He was an obnoxious bastard, and I'm pretty sure he was using his own powers on himself.\n\nI learned from my mistakes, bought a nice suit, handgun, and custom mask from a place that didn't ask questions, and acquired grander ambitions than mere money, and with these new assets, I have become the villain that killed more heroes than anyone else in this entire state, but having learned from my mistakes, I do not let this get to my head.\n\nI carefully plan my crimes, just shoot dangerous enemies that I face, and, most importantly, know when to run like fuck.\n\nSo, yeah. I hope my girlfriend is happy with this, because I'm sure as hell not posting anymore delicate information about myself.\n\n...Unless she gives me the puppy dog eyes. I can never resist those.",

In my hands was a dagger; the blade was made of that same element.\n\n...I also knew that, given enough time, he would break the table and escape.\n\n. . .\n\n\"So, Evil Overlord, what are your plans for the people of San Francisco?\"\n\nCaptain Invincible asked me this while I could see his hands fidgeting in the bonds I created to keep him restrained. I had to act fast: the bonds were unbreakable, but the table upon which they were fastened was not.\n\n\"Why would I tell you? You're going to die soon enough anyway,\" I replied, as I approached. I assumed his anatomy was like a human's, so his heart should be in the same place--and right where I wanted to place my dagger.\n\n\"But...but...but villains always monologue what they're--\"\n\n\"No,\" I interrupted as I made my way to the table. I saw Captain Invincible begin to sweat, and his movements grow more frantic. I also heard the steel of the table start to *scrreeeech* from metal fatigue as the Captain began to work against his bonds, fueled by desperation.\n\n\"Look, you're about to destroy my table, and I can't have that.\" I placed the tip of the dagger over his chest, right at what should be his heart.\n\nHe began to jerk up and down, trying to escape. His face was a mask of pure panic. \"Wait! Maybe I-- we can make a deal!\"\n\n\"No deals,\" I replied. \"You die.\" \n\nI plunged the knife into his chest, tearing a hole in the blue of his tights. His blood welled up over the wound. For someone who was rumored to have extraterrestrial roots, his blood was the same red as mine as it poured out of his chest, powered by his faltering heart.\n\nI watched with glee as the shock registered on his face: Mouth agape, eyes wide...the man who supposedly could not be killed was now dying on my table as his life's blood changed the color of his blue tights to a deeper, redder hue, the color taking its time to crawl across the material like an approaching storm cloud of blood as it soaked the fabric.\n\nI saw him sag back, and his head loll to one side as I twisted the blade to make sure I did extra damage. \n\n. . .\n\nI left the knife in, and went around to the other side of the steel table. I bent over, and checked under it--yep, there were tears and breaks in the steel. Another few seconds, and he could have freed himself. That would have been bad news for me; I am still an ordinary mortal. Captain Invincible could have torn the bonds free, and while encumbered with wrist and ankle bands of glowing rock that weakened him, he still could have made a formidable opponent.\n\nThat just would not do. \n\nI got up, and went over to look at his face: His eyes were half-closed, his mouth slack. I reached out with my right hand, touched his neck and checked his pulse...\n\nNothing. \n\nI pulled out a penlight similar to what doctors use, and used my left hand to pry open an eyelid. I flashed the light at one brown eye; no response from the pupil. I tried the other, with the same result.\n\n. . .\n\nSatisfied, I left the table and whipped out my phone. I made the call:\n\n\"He's dead.\"\n\n\"The material worked?\" \n\n\"It did.\"\n\n\"Good! When can we start the next phase of the plan?\"\n\n\"When I find his brother and kill him, as well,\" I said as I hung up.\n\nOne down, one to go.",

And very rich, very influential. Everyone who is anyone owes quite a bit to me. What most don't know when they first meet me is just exactly who I am. You see, I've been around a long, long time, and destroyed more adversaries than you will ever know. Of course, I do get credit for that sometimes, but it's usually for things I have little to do with. Oh, the absurd things people blame me for! Not that I care one way or the other. Sure, I admit I have quite an ego. I'm notorious for it. But not around my villainy. I'm in it for the win, not the glory, and I usually win. My greatest conquests are unknown, like dirty little rackets with your average corrupt street cop, or robbing poor travellers on back roads in third world countries. Ah, those years in India picking off innocents, what good times! Now, I won't be falsely humble: There are certainly a few adventures of mine you might know of. The Kennedy assassination. The rise of the the Third Reich, and also the Soviet Union. I even managed to have a small hand in the crucifixion of Jesus. Oh, yes! I know I seem young and vigorous, but the truth is I'm very old. So if we meet in person, please show me some courtesy and maybe have a bit of sympathy for this old villain. That's not a request, but a demand, even a threat: Use all your well-learned politesse, or I will lay your soul to waste. But never mind that. As I was saying: I'm pleased to meet you. I hope you guessed my name.",

Now to watch as the bait brings the flies, Superman won't know what hit him. \"Ahh, Lois Lane.\" I say to myself. \"Superman's kryptonite... Except for kryptonite of course, but that's not to worry.

I quickly straighten up, putting my eye back in the cup. \"Can't be getting lazy now, so close to the finish line.\" I check the status of my motion sensors; all green. \"Just a matter of time.\" Seconds later I hear an explosion above my head as the sky tries to turn it's self inside out. Superman hovers slowly to the ground in the clearing that I had placed Lois into. BANG! Explosions engulf Superman and Lois, atomized Kryptonite instantly immobilizes Superman, having it covering the inside of his lungs he is rendered mortal. The second the smoke clears thunderous explosions ring out. The ground where Superman had been is shredded by the auto-cannon in a hail of deafening explosions. \"That bastard will never host his goddamn monster mash in our city ever again... YOU HEAR ME YOU GODDAMN MONSTER? What? Did you think you were a god? That you could fucking decide who lives and who dies?

The obvious next step was to replace his major bones with this material (he calls it GrapeMatter). \n\nHe's a dick. I mean, all he does is talk to the media about how he can't save the world without help from all of us and how \"we are all one people\". \nI guess I should talk about 2017, where he saved 3 falling planes in 3 weeks and then saved 7 schools in one week from a shooter. Now everyone calls him the greatest person ever. I just want to have ONE WEEK where the media doesn't gush over his supposed awesomeness. So I decided I would assemble my crew.\n\nNo, we don't mess around. We cannot be tracked. We work through the deep web. I've made some income through my deep web search engine, Not Evil. \n\nShit, that was easy. We just PM'ed him through his Twitter account and invited him to an interview. We own an apartment in downtown Orlando and we've got a few traps set up. I am legitimately excited. Ok, I know he can survive a fully-automatic weapon from his adventures in California, but I'm not sure he can survive a shotgun. He can survive over 1000 degree temperatures in Fahrenheit and over 20Gs of force. So we won't kill him with knifes or guns. We do have the Fucking sun at our disposal and we have a few mirrors here and there. Let's get into position\n\nOh my God, he's here. \n\n\"Hello\"\n\"Hello, my good friend\"\n\"Ok, let's start this interview with a bang.

I've just been a good person and have been enjoying the occasional interview\"\n\"Have you realized that the media has been sucking your dick?\"\n\"Can you say that on the air?\"\n\"Oh, no. That would end terribly for me\"\n\"What's going on\"\n\"Alright, I'll level with you. I hate you. The media has twisted your heroics from last year and spun it to make it seem like news.\"\n\"That sucks, but I can't control that\"\n\"Not now, but you could have\"\n\"And since I didn't, what are you going to do about it?\"\n\"Is that a threat?\"\n\"Maybe\"\n\"That's funny, I was going to threaten you\"\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Ok, you can go\"\n\"I don't feel well, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?\"\n\"I just shot a powerful, but invisible, and small Gamma-ray Lazer right into your heart. Nobody will notice it was me and you don't even know my name.\"\n\"YOU GAVE ME CANCER?\"\n\"Oh, that won't be what kills you. We have a giant freezer right above you\"\n\"ARE YOU GOING TO-\"\n\"No, were not going to crush you. We're going to take a giant ice cube and crush you with that. We have a truck to carry the Lazer and Freezer away. We have established a moving company and disguised the truck as that. We have also started a leak right above you.

I am here for a purpose, and one purpose only...to preserve the status quo.\n\nDo not get me wrong. I don't suppose to have a purpose on this planet. All I know is what I feel, and what I feel is to strangle every last drop of empathy from this planet. Cold, calculating, precise, relentless, etcetera. That's how quite a few scrupulous characters would bother to describe how I behave, but they have yet to fathom who I truly AM. I do not subscribe to any form of human nature in the quest to describe myself, my being, my essence. \n\nEntirely selfless am I in the quest to erase human existence from the face of Earth. Cockroaches but are we, finding any rock to hide under whilst 'praying' our newfound shelter will provide us solace from the ever flowing tides we call life itself. Humanity is fragile and weak. I only seek to root out, and extinguish, the plight of our Mother Earth.\n\nThey call me villainous, but is that truly what I am? \n\nIs someone who wants the planet to thrive and flourish an enemy of the people?\n\nIs someone who wants the end of suffering an enemy of the people?\n\nThis planet, this mound of birth and decay we call Earth, is nothing more than a womb. A womb which we, humanity, have no respect for and take every chance we get to hack up for personal gain and the 'prospect' of human advancement. We bleed the planet dry of resources and, even though she is not able to scream, continue to eviscerate her without a second thought. When we realize what we have done and how permanent the damage is, it will be too late to fix anything. This is where I step in.\n\nI am no social justice warrior by any means, nor am I some life preserving pansy. I exists purely for my own survival, and if that means murdering tens, hundreds, or thousands along the way...I harbor no qualms, for I live not for myself. What I can contribute to, on a day to day basis, is the fundamental idea that most of nature deserves a place to carve out their life and the lives of those whom they hold dear. \n\nNow I don't murder recklessly. I don't take life without cause, nor do I strike out of vengeance...but when an animal bares its teeth at me, I respond in kind. \n\nThese Heroes...these self-described saviors of the human race...what a fucking joke. They may claim that they exercise their powers for the betterment of the human race but we all know the only thing they're after....notoriety. Their claim to fame is daily acts of empty altruism that only propagate the continual suffering of our sweet Earth by allowing the toxic scum that call themselves 'human' to continue over-populating the planet. \n\nIt is my responsibility, nay, my duty, to rid Earth of any and EVERYONE who seeks to continue its destruction. I need to rid Earth of the virus known as man, and anyone who protects them.\n\nNot only am I the destruction of man-kind and those who protect them...I'm Captain Planet.\n",

            "comment": "Look here, I'm just doing my job. Sure, you might think I'm some kind of jerk but when you think about it, the world needs a counter to the plethera of oh so dandy heroes out there.  Every since I was a youngin, I wanted to be a hero like the very few that started the business. Oh, you didn't know? People are so caught up with this super hero ideaology that damn near anyone can get themselves a gig nowadays, whether it be stopping a butter knife wielding, cracked out mugger or the latest of alien life forms trying to dominate our species.  Honestly, it's getting too oversaturated and sickening to watch.\n\nI was given a very specific and hard to screw up set of rules... \"You see a good guy that you know you can kill? You kill him\" is what I was taught since the day I lost (and regained at the same time) hope.  I don't go chasing the top tier heroes because, let's be honest, I'd get my ass handed to me by a barrage of whatever omnipotent force you believe in.  Is it a \"sunshine and rainbows\" kind of job? Hell no.  Does it keep things somewhat balanced? Eh, depends on the tier of the kill list I'm given for that week.\n\nIt used to be so simple, look at the list and kill a hero.  First I started out with Batman because, let's be real, he was an awful \"hero\".  Once I managed to effortlessly slink behind him while he was monologuing with whoever the hell \"The Joker\" was, all it took was a gunshot to the back of the head.  Things got a bit overinflated on behalf of my ego though.  I thought to myself \"Well damn, if that sucker was so easy then why not go for king shit on turd mountain?\", who at the time, was Superman.  Let me tell you, he is no joke, even with a few bullets encased in kryptonite.  \n\nThis is where things got real weird and real dark, real fast.  I couldn't beat him.  Even though I fired kryptonite at him he could just get out of the way of the bullet it was in, just enough to where the radiation from it would barely tickle him.  After years I drew the last straw and went to what I knew best.  Was it my proudest moment, crawling back to dear ole daddy, asking for his help? Absolutely not.  Was it worth it? Depends on who you ask.\n\nYou see, the thing is that I have an abnormally strange ability.  Some would say, in the same manner as someone calling out a spoiled trust fund baby, that I was handed this \"gift\".  You'd be surprised at how much of a dick my dad is when it comes to giving people power over others, especially when it came to being the absolute best.  You see, my dearest ole daddy is a fella that those in the mortal realm call \"Satan\" or \"Lucifer\".  Me? I call him a dick, a cunt, a bastardizing douche. \n\nSure, kids have issues with their parents but mine was a tad more complicated.  Once I was born to a mortal woman, she immediately had me baptised through the Catholic church, in order to hopefully wipe away the sins of those far before me.  After nearly dying to Superman, however, I made a call to dad by simply cutting open my girlfriend's throat (the dumbass saved herself for marriage).  The deal was not an easy sell but dearest ole dickhead dad agreed to cosign on my loan.  Weird, right?\n\nThe thing is, when you make a bargain like mine and prepare it as such an amazing business offer as I did, you're forced to talk to the CEO of *everything*.  Good ole grandpappy himself, the head honcho of all that is and will ever live, G-O-D.  I had to sell my pitch of trading my soul for divine power on both ends of the spectrum, being the command of heaven *and* hell, along with all of the might belonging to the two.  Let me tell you, it took me creating (only my uncle knows) wars, plagues, human faults, etc. but I did it.  I was given the keys to the weapons vault of both heaven and hell and, after doing some tinkering, managed to infuse the best of both worlds into my however many fingers humans have.\n\nNowadays I just wait for an angel or demon to spring up and let me know when a hero is too good and get to work.  It's pretty simple once you have the power of both ends of the spectrum in terms of life's greatest powers at you fingertips, just point, choose where they're going, and focus.  I usually send them to hell so I can let dad have some fun still but a few of the noble ones actually get to meet grandpappy and my uncle J and hang with them for a while.  Is it tough? Absolutely not.  The moment I walk up to one of those assholes they know what their fate is and *usually* (Superman was pompous enough to require *eight* suns being condensed *into* him to kill him) accept a swift death.  But hey, I asked for it and I received it.",

I operate in some of the most crime ridden and deprived areas of Africa trying to bring some shred of hope to their often short lives.\n\n\nMy methods have been criticized by many but the ends justify the means. I don\u2019t consider myself a criminal, I am simply balancing the scales. The machines that I pioneered are a master work of revolutionary drilling techniques and artificial intelligence combined into that which brings power to the powerless.\nThe core objective of my project is rerouting parts of vast underground water supplies in these improvised regions bringing life where there is none.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve seen grass spring from scorching desert dunes, I\u2019ve witnessed cracked, dry landscapes transformed into beautiful farms with crops stretching for acres. I\u2019ve seen villages where starvation was rife and the open pits where the bodies were cast transformed because they could now sustain themselves and yet they still call me a criminal.\n\n\n\n\nMy project has admittedly cause some minor inconveniences. Water supplies are more limited in the bigger cities where I operate and the rich can no longer run their fountains or water then extravagant lawns daily but I\u2019ve made a difference. I\u2019M the one who has saved lives, I\u2019M the one who has brought change and they still have the gall to send some Oxford educated moron with an easy smile and a suave accent to my door.\n\n\n\nHis actions were first brought to my attention when unit #3 mysteriously exploded during an otherwise standard operation. Feedback from the sensors had been good, completely nominal operation across the board and then nothing. My technical team didn\u2019t file the final report from their expedition. Their last digital logs said the tunnels looked good and the drilling had progressed well but the machine itself had clearly been sabotaged as it was buried by a partial cave in strewn with shards of twisted metal. Another few million up in smoke, the third in as many months.\n\n\n\nI arrived on site some hours later and told my pilot to set down 100m away from the site entrance. John was a world class pilot, he flew with the USMC for 8 years but a Bell corporate helicopter isn\u2019t equipped like a Viper. The only warning we had was the small smoke trail we could see quickly snaking it\u2019s way towards our helicopter. The next 15 seconds were pure terror. Wailing claxons. PULL UP, PULL UP. A crushing impact. Then that eerie silence that you only hear in these desolate areas.\n\n\n\nWhen I my eyes finally adjusted to the light I saw the burning wreckage some 5 meters away. I must have been thrown clear, or did I jump?...I heard footsteps approaching and I turned to see the outline of a man slowly approaching over the sand. I called out.\n\n\n\u201cJohn?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe response came slowly with a well practiced smugness, rolling off the tongue like a sickly treacle as if rehearsed in a mirror.\n\n\n\u201cJohn? No, the names Bond. James Bo...\u201d\n\n\nI\u2019d heard the name from my operations team. I was warned it was him they\u2019d send to shut us down.\n\n\n\nThe Walther PPK isn\u2019t my first choice of gun but I must admit it\u2019s compact and easy to handle with a relatively low kick back\n\n\nA snap of my wrist, a squeeze of the trigger, a thud on the sand and again that silence. The dust that kicked up blew across the dessert floor scratching my eyes for a moment.\n\n\nAs I lay here I can only hope that the helicopter crashing has alerted my operations team. My right leg is shattered and I\u2019m starting to feel cold\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(Be gentle, this is my first ever attempt at a prompt)",

            "comment": "I didn't really know what to think of it. \"Don't look at the moon\"? Sure, no problem. Going back to sleep now. But then I saw my other notifications...99+? Ok, something is definitely up.\n\nI tried to call my girlfriend, but I notice one of the texts I got was from her. \"You really should go look at the moon, its amazing.\" I flip on the tele to see if there's any coverage on what the hell is going on but it just says its off the air. Flip to another channel, same thing. Ok, I'm starting to freak out about this point. Get my laptop, check out Reddit, everything on r/all is urging people to look at the moon. \n\nI try to call my parents, my sister, my friends, no answer from any of them. I'm sitting on the floor with my knees tucked under my chin, rocking slightly back and forth. There's a part of me that just wants to run outside and stare upwards, give in to the madness. Somehow I repress that urge. Then I notice something strange.\n\nThe window. It's twenty til 4 but the light coming in through the window is getting more intense. I watch the pale beams stream in, casting an eerie glow into the room. Moonlight doesn't look like that. Moonlight *can't* look like that. I closed my eyes real tight. I began to cry.\n\nI waited. I sat there on the floor, crying like a child, hiding from the unnatural light under the covers. My blanket was thick, yet the cruel light kept peaking through the threads. I began to hyperventilate. The closeness of my breath under the blanket was hard to bear but I did not dare uncover myself for air. I tried to distract myself with my phone, checked for updates, tried to get a hold of anyone, but to no avail. Still the same messages over and over, tempting me. 'Just a couple of hours and the sun will come up. Then I'll be safe.' I thought to myself. \n\n2 hours later. Dawn had not come.\n\n3 hours later. Dawn had not come.\n\nI risked a small opening of the cover so I could look at the room. Not only had the light intensified, it now seemed to engulf my room in a maddening pale light. Presently I became aware of a constant humming. I listened to try and identify the source, but it was unlike anything I had heard before. Like the whir of some inhuman machinery. My mind began to race. I cried out for someone, *anyone* to come and save me, to end this nightmare. But no one came.\n\nI lay there on my floor, in a state bordering madness for another 5 hours. After the 3rd hour I began to babble to myself. With every hour the whir seemed to get louder and closer, my room was now light up like a movie set. I maneuvered myself under the bed but the vile light had stolen the shadows from even there! \n\nThroughout the day the urge to uncover myself and run laughing and screaming into the streets grew stronger and I had to stop myself from jumping up at regular intervals. The whir was now being accompanied by a constant 'thrumming' which preyed my weakened sanity.  \n\nI like to believe that I lasted longer than anyone else, in the end.\n\nI began to beat my head against the floor, in an attempt to shut out the unceasing noise. Eventually I was slamming it so hard I believe I gave myself a concussion. \n\nI couldn't take it anymore. All at once I wriggled out from under the bed in my cocoon, threw the blankets off of me and darted out my door. I ran down the hallway where even *here* the light had spread itself, even in a place *with no windows*. Down the stairs and up to the front door, I nearly tore it off its hinges on my way out. \n\nWell it wasn't a moon.\n\nThe eyes are what gave it away.\n\nThough they were right...it really was quite beautiful.\n\n\n&lt;If you actually read this whole thing, thank you. I don't write these at all but there was something about this one that got my brain flowing.&gt;",

            "comment": "Andrew nearly snarled as his phone chimed for what seemed to be the umpteenth time. His shift at the warehouse ended only a few hours ago and it like chickens running around with their heads chopped off whenever he left. It was rare delight to encounter the nights that he was actually permitted to sleep through the night.\n\nOn top of the texts that were just brimming with simple incompetency, the morons that lit up his phone in the middle of the night always seemed to wake up his wife, Isabel, who suffered from insomnia to begin with. The raise Andrew agreed to that stated he kept his ringer on for these occasions never seemed worth it when he saw Isabel the next day, curled up in the guest room with dark circles under her eyes from her attempts to get away from the constant chiming. \n\nAndrew rubbed a hand over eyes to clear them, trying to understand the ridiculous amount of messages but he must have been more tired than he thought since they didn\u2019t make sense.\n\nHe quickly scrolled through the message previews, finding they all seemed to follow the same pattern: to look at the moon. The moon? What the -? Why?\n\nIt was like a shot to his adrenaline when he saw that some of the messages were coming from Isabel\u2019s phone. He shot up from bed, seeing the other side empty, and jumped to his feet. \n\n\u201cHun, what\u2019s going on,\u201d Andrew questioned, still scrolling through his phone while walking towards the guest room.  The room was at the end of the hallway and the door was wide open. He could see Isabel standing in the middle of the room, arms down by her side and phone clutched in her hand as she gazed out the window. \n\nAs he grew closer, he could see that she was shaking, \u201cBel? Honey? What\u2019s wrong, why-\u201d\n\nIsabel\u2019s body whipped toward him and Andrew couldn\u2019t help himself, he froze in place. She ran and shoved her body into the door, slamming it shut and locking it in place. \n\nThe speed was all wrong though, Andrew had never seen her move that fast. It was insane, it was...inhuman\u2026.\n\nHis own body started to tremble when he remembered her eyes. Her pupils were dilated and not a single bit of the green irises he loved so much were left. \n\nHe was just about to ram his own body into the door, to beg her to let him in and make her explain what is happening, but then she started sobbing. \n\n\u201cAndrew! You need to run, you need to hide! I\u2019m so sorry, god I am so sorry. Run, Andrew, and whatever you do, don\u2019t look at the moon!\u201d \n\nAndrew started pounding his fists on the door and trying to shove his weight against it, but she must have blocked it with something. \n\nDespite his shouting and his pleading to be let in, his forgotten phone on the hallway floor seemed to crack through the commotion as the alarms of the emergency alert system distracted him for just a moment. The robotic voice started to play from his phone automatically, \u201cWARNING. THIS IS NOT A TEST. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ALERT. DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON. WARNING. THIS IS NOT A TES-\u201d\n\nAndrew thought his distress was at its peak, nothing was making sense and he just needed to get Isabel so they could deal with this together. He just needed to-\n\nHer screams started and it struck him cold to the very center of his being. He began pounding and kicking at the door until it gave way under his body. Isabel was on the floor, writhing in the moonlight. Andrew couldn\u2019t help it, his knees buckled and he emptied the contents of his stomach right where he stood. \n\nIsabel's body was bent at every wrong angle possible but she wasn\u2019t screaming anymore. Her head snapped in his direction with that ungodly speed again. Bathed in the moon\u2019s light and pupils still completely dilated, she smiled up at him as if every bone in her body wasn\u2019t broken. \n\nIn the same voice she used to tell soothe him time after time, she whispered, \u201cLook at the moon, Andrew.\u201d \n",

            "comment": "\"It wasn't my phone that woke me up, but my wife. She's always been a lighter sleeper than me, and even though I had it on silent, the constant stream of notification vibrations was making the phone shuck and jive all over my nightstand.\n\n\"Honey. Hoooooooney. HONEY!\" I came awake to a rough shake accompanying the words. \"Yeahwah?\" I managed, blearily.\n\n\"Your phone. Somebody is blowing you up.\" \n\n\"Must be my other girlfriend.\" An old joke, wildly inappropriate considering what was to follow. \"Mmhhmm.\" She mumbled, already well on her way back to sleep. I checked the bedside clock; the red LED showing 3 am on the nose. Weird. I leaned awkwardly, half awake, and grabbed my phone, and had to do a doubletake when I saw the notifications. 186 texts, 93 missed calls, and one emergency notification. What. The Actual. Fuck? I thought, ok, this is a dream, must be a dream. I don't even know 186 people. Ok. Must be a natural disaster on the way. Or did Kim Jong Un launch nukes at the west coast? Shit. \n\nWith slightly shaking hands, I thumbed the official notification, expecting the worst. I held my breath. \n\n\"DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.\"\n\nWait, what? The feeling of surreal vertigo intensified. The logical part of my brain was continuing to insist that this was, this MUST, be a dream, must be a dream, must be...\n\n\"Shut up, shut up.\" I whispered to myself, climbing out of bed. I was awake now, fully, rigidly awake, and so I decided to take my phone to the living room to investigate further. Plopping down on the couch, I started scrolling through texts. \"Curiouser and curiouser,\" I mumbled to myself, looking at the texts. None of them from numbers I recognized. Some of them...not even from phone numbers. Entries from numbers with only 8 digits, or 6, or 2. Entries with letters and numbers mixed together. Entries with letters and numbers and Chinese characters mixed in. Emojis and symbols mixed in. My disquiet was growing steadily. I clicked the first message. \n\n\"Wow, look at the moon! It's so big and beautiful. Amazing, isn't it\"\n\nSo, ok, my brain responded. Not a dream. A practical joke. Someone is messing with me. With my phone. I wonder if my wife is in on this. I clicked the next text.\n\n\"It's such a beautiful night tonight. Just look! The moon looks amazing. It's so big!\"\n\n\"Look at the moon! Wow, it looks so cool! Look honey!\"\n\nSomething about the \"honey\" sent a chill up my spine. My wife, shaking me awake, popped back into my mind, unbidden.\n\n\"Look at that moon out over the water honey!\" It looks so huge so close to the horizon. Why does it do that?\"\n\n\"It's such a beautiful night honey, look! Wow, the moon looks awesome!\"\n\nAnd as I was reading these, I realized, I could hear a voice speaking the words. Quietly, like they were coming from very far away, repeating, looping over each other, blurring speeding up, slowing down, warping. \n\nLook at the moon, go outside, look at the moon, go outside, look at the moon, it's a beautiful night, go look at the moon.\"\n\nMustering all the calm I could, I set my phone, face down, on the couch. Some still logical functionality commanded me to turn on the TV. Turn on the news. Yes. Normalcy. Emergency broadcast system. Yes. That's a good idea. I turned it on. It's 3 am, surely more than a minute has passed but it says 3 am, right there in the corner of the screen, 3:00AM PDT, and even though it's the middle of the night, there's Anderson Cooper, and he's staring at me, I swear he's looking right at me, and suddenly turning on the news seems like it was a really bad idea. \n\n\"West coast residents are being warned tonight not to look at the moon. Authorities are warning that looking at the moon might destroy your life and could unravel the very fabric of reality. Ben, DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.\"\n\nI pressed the power button again on the remote and the TV shut off. Heart trying to thud its way out of my chest, I stood, and walked back towards my bedroom. Somehow, I knew before I opened the door that my wife would be awake, and she was. She was sitting up, her face lit by her phone screen. \n\n\"I shouldn't have told you to look at the moon, honey. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Wait, what? Are you?...Are you in on this too? What is going on!\"\n\nShe looked down, and started crying. \"I'm sorry, honey. I'm so so sorry.\"\n\nI rushed over and sat down hard on the bed, right in front of her. \"Sorry for what!\" I demanded, panic seizing control of me as I grabbed her shoulders. \"Sorry for WHAT! What THE FUCK is going on!!?? Sorry for what??!!\"\n\nShe stopped crying, and smiled. Her eyes were far away, glazed, almost robotic. \"Oh WOW!\" she said \"Wow, honey, it's such a beautiful night tonight! Just look at the moon!\"\n\nI let go of her shoulders, and stood up. I walked calmly, out of the room, out through the living room to the hall to the back door. I threw it open, feeling like my arms and legs were moving on their own. Like I was merely a passenger. I could feel my pulse in my ears. I stepped out, into my backyard. I tilted my head to the sky, and I looked at the moon. \n\nAnd then I remembered. God help me, I remembered. Driving along, southbound on coast highway, coming home from a long night. She was tired, dried sweat had warped her perfect hairdo, but she still looked radiant. Face lit by the dash lights, and of course, by the moon. She had sung her heart out tonight, and the crowd had eaten it up. She was a bright shining star, tonight. Hanging out there, seeming mere inches from the horizon, the big, swollen, full face of the moon. Just about to set. \n\n\"Oh WOW!\" she said \"Wow, honey, it's such a beautiful night tonight! Just look at the moon!\" \n\nAnd I did. I took my eyes off the road, and I did. She was right, of course. It was beautiful.\"\n\nI sighed.\n\n\"And then I heard an awful sound, like a loud pop, and we were upside down, flying, weightless, like somehow we had been pulled by the moon into space. The car was full of weird things floating through the air, coins, a pen cap, her mic had even floated in from the back into the front. I had one last look at her face. It was still transitioning from the marvel at the beauty of the moon to the shock of the crash. I tried to reach out my hand, but I seemed to be moving through jello. The moon filled the windshield, seemed to get even bigger, brighter, turned the sky white, turned the whole world white.\"\n\nI wept a little then. Not as much as I would, later, but a little. \n\n\"You know the rest,\" I said when I had regained my composure. \"I came out of the coma. I woke up here.\"\n\nThe officer stared at me, and I could tell she was struggling to keep her face impassive. She felt bad for me, but she didn't want to. \n\n\"I'm sorry for your loss.\" she said, looking down at her notepad. She hadn't taken down a single word of it. \"Can you tell me how much you'd had to drink that night?\"\n\nI sighed again. Could I? No, not really. Quite a few. Too fucking many.\n\n\"No,\" I answered. \"No, I don't think I can.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"You're going to need a lawyer. When you're ready to get out of here, I mean.\"\n\nI looked down at my broken body. Just a mess of wires and tubes and casts. \"Yeah,\" was all I could muster. \n\nShe stood, and walked toward the door of my hospital room. She put her hand on the door, and without turning, she asked, \"do you think if you'd obeyed the warning, you'd still be in the coma?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" I said, quietly. \"Yes, I do.\"",

Turns out he'd lived an entire life in a coma, wife, kid... Everything.\n\nHe posted his story on reddit somewhere.\n\nEdit: some people are having difficulty reading it, here it is.\n\nthrow away account cause this is really personal.\n\nMy last semester at a certain college I was assulted by a football player for walking where he was trying to drive (note he was 325lbs I was 120lbs), while unconscious on the ground I lived a different life. \n\nI met a wonderful young lady, she made my heart skip and my face red, I pursued her for months and dispatched a few jerk boyfriends before I finally won her over, after two years we got married and almost immediately she bore me a daughter. \n\nI had a great job and my wife didn't have to work outside of the house, when my daughter was two she [my wife] bore me a son. My son was the joy of my life, I would walk into his room every morning before I left for work and doted on him and my daughter.\n\nOne day while sitting on the couch I noticed that the perspective of the lamp was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D but... just.. wrong. (It was a square lamp base, red with gold trim on 4 legs and a white square shade). I was transfixed, I couldn't look away from it. I stayed up all night staring at it, the next morning I didn't go to work, something was just not right about that lamp. \n\nI stopped eating, I left the couch only to use the bathroom at first, soon I stopped that too as I wasn't eating or drinking. I stared at the fucking lamp for 3 days before my wife got really worried, she had someone come and try to talk to me, by this time my cognizance was breaking up and my wife was freaking out. She took the kids to her mother's house just before I had my epiphany.... the lamp is not real.... the house is not real, my wife, my kids... none of that is real... the last 10 years of my life are not fucking real! \n\nThe lamp started to grow wider and deeper, it was still inverted dimensions, it took up my entire perspective and all I could see was red, I heard voices, screams, all kinds of weird noises and I became aware of pain.... a fucking shit ton of pain... the first words I said were \"I'm missing teeth\" and opened my eyes.  I was laying on my back on the sidewalk surrounded by people that I didn't know, lots were freaking out, I was completely confused. \n\nat some point a cop scooped me up, dragged/walked me across the sidewalk and grass and threw me face down in the back of a cop car, I was still confused. \n\nI was taken to the hospital by the cop (seems he didn't want to wait for the ambulance to arrive) and give CT scans and shit..\n\nI went through about 3 years of horrid depression, I was grieving the loss of my wife and children and dealing with the knowledge that they never existed, I was scared that I was going insane as I would cry myself to sleep hoping I would see her in my dreams. I never have, but sometimes I see my son, usually just a glimpse out of my peripheral vision,  he is perpetually 5 years old and I can never hear what he says. \n\n\n\nEDIT (24 hours after post): never though anyone would read this, I changed a line so that it no longer seems that my 2 year old daughter bore a child.\n\nI have never seen Inception or the Star Trek episode so many have mentioned (but I will eventually)\n\nI will not do an AMA\n\nI've had many PM's describing similar experiences and 3 posters stating such experiences are impossible,  I'd say more research needs to be done on brain functions.

I once dreamt that I was riding a bike in my neighbourhood, life was moving as it should, but then came this beautiful woman and I noticed her from not very far and things started to slow down, I'm not a spiritual kind of person, but she had an aura filled with warmness and I couldn't help but be drawn to her. She had the most outstanding smile and she was looking at me like I was Cary Grant, she was passing by and I wanted to look at her, I could turn my neck, but the rest of my body was avoiding my commands, as she passed she kept looking at me, until we were side by side, when she had left me with her last smile, I kept on looking wondering \"who is she?\", when I woke up the other day, I search it up about dreams and I read that our brains can't make faces up, but what it can do is mix features of people that I already know, later I went to the spot I found her in my dreams, needless to say, to no avail. I don't think soulmates exist in real life, but maybe they do in our dreams, even if just for a little while.\n\nNow that I wrote it down, it sounds really cheesy hahaha",

                                    "comment": "I'd speculate that the likely course of events (without attempting to describe the mechanisms and physical impact trauma involved) would be something like this: Your sense of identity was disrupted temporarily by impact trauma to your frontal lobes, and during your period of unconsciousness, your brain scrambled to piece together an identity that made sense, based on what it did still have access to. If all of your autobiographical memories and knowledge were blocked off from your \"brain's\" access (likely meaning networking points are compromised, preventing different brain areas from communicating with the parts that lead to consciousness) but instead all it did still have access to was things like: Your raw emotions, your schemas and expectations for certain roles or scenarios, basically anything other than your actual autobiographical memories...it's far more normal for the human brain to make up something that makes sense (just like how your brain fills in blind spots in your visual field with what it expects), than to admit it doesn't know things that it definitely should know. This can even be so extreme as making up a story to explain your identity based on what you do know, rather than admitting you have no identity (which makes far less sense). Especially if you were unconscious and had no reality-checking or people around you to remind you who you were. \n\nYou might want to read accounts of people who have suffered dissociative fugue and other associated disorders - just keep in mind that they're not exactly the same as your case. True dissociative fugue happens when repression (picture a physical chemical blockade that acts to silence a \"bad thought\" by sitting in between 2 areas and not allowing them to communicate) occurs at an important junction in the brain that ends up cutting off the person from their own sense of identity and/or personality. They typically wander from their homes, sometimes recovering spontaneously, other times forming an entire new identity and life before finally remembering themselves. In your case it's not repression, but physical trauma, inflammation, cell death, things like that that could cause a similar effect to repression.\n\nAs someone who suffers PTSD, I can relate this much - having thoughts and experiences seemingly \"injected\" into your memory without any time context can make it feel like they just happened, even if they actually happened decades ago, or never at all in cases that are generated spontaneously by the mind like in your case. I am also a psych undergrad, so take everything here with a grain of salt. But I hope what I have said here brings you closer to understanding your experience.",

I used to mess around with whatever was available and I had a friend who often offered more before anyone fully came down, and in my semi-conscious state I accepted another snort and spiraled impossibly deep into what I believe they call a K-hole.  I swear to god I lived a thousand lives.  Fully, completely, start to finish.  Many spectacular and many awful miserable lives.  Each life was farther from my reality, things got slightly different each layer I went down.  Subtilties that on their own meant nothing but when combined with all the other inconsistencies began to create a picture that was entirely unrecognizable to the life and reality we exist in.  I began to lose my humanity, like was I even human?  Was I still on Earth?  Like just who the fuck am I and where the hell am I?  Eventually this k-hole reality started to slowly shatter and my own life began to put it's self together, but mentally I was broken.  Apparently for the last hour or so I had been crawling and rolling around on the ground mumbling, groaning and foaming at the mouth, the first 10 minute of \"coming back\" to reality I spent rocking back and forth and whispering \"I'm scared.... I'm scared\" and my friends tried to get me to drink water and calm down.  Hands down the most traumatizing thing I've ever experienced.  I ended up going home and laying in the dark, not eating or speaking to anyone for 3 days.  I wasn't entirely convinced this wasn't one of those k-hole lives and I didn't know how much to invest myself in what I was experiencing.  I cried for a lot of those first 3 days.  I'm still confused about it all.  For the most part perception is our reality and struggle with trying to determine how much of that was a hallucination or if I had really transcended into these other lives.  I hadn't thought about that experience in 7 years and as I write this I'm reminded of the fear that I could find myself waking up of the floor on a friends room all over again struggling to remember my name and who I am and what's real",

I developed relationships, I went on summer trips, I lived in a place that was fully detailed. There was just something about the perspective that was off, the sky was too close and everything was slightly too flat or it squashed and after a while I noticed it more and more and then things began to tint orange and I came out of it and woke up. Its been 5 or 6 years and I still remember every detail, and every face, dislikes and likes, places I went, all of it but I can't remember the inside of my house and I'm sceptical I'm even remembering the correct things because I can't trust my memory after that experience.\n\nIt made me consider what is reality, or what is it that I'm experiencing. My brain can't tell the difference between reality, and whatever was going on inside my mind so how can I trust myself that I'm not caught up in something now and I just can't tell the difference. Our minds are clearly limited in its capacity to recognise false from real, where does that end? How much is real or false, I believe what I am experiencing now is real, and I know what I went through wasn't. I can tell the difference but at the time I couldn't and I could only understand after the experience. How do I know what is reality isn't just a dream for something else. It's strange and confusing.\n\nI'm being serious about this, I genuinely had a similar experience and there are so many details I've skimmed over. These things happen to people. I'v never taken drugs, I barely drink, so a part of me thinks this was the result of a natural release of DMT in my brain. I know people have similar experiences taking DMT or ayahuasca, perhaps there is a connection.\n\n I've been researching a lot since and I've read journals that try and explain the emergence of consciousnesses in humans and the common thread, which is a combination of different theories, is humans started to cook their food and they began to consume mushrooms.",

A man who had a wife, kids, grew old together with them, all while knocked out for a mere 20 minutes of our time. Only to come to and miss everyone he loved, who never existed.\n\nedit: this post https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oc7rc/have_you_ever_felt_a_deep_personal_connection_to/c3g4ot3/",

I'll wake up in my dream and start my day normally, only to wake up a couple hours in and realize I haven't done any of that yet. The rest of the morning is like watching a replay. It used to happen to me in high school, my dad would wake me up, I'd eat breakfast, drive to school and take my first class. Then my dad would wake me up. It was overwhelmingly disorienting, and because the entire dream was things I would actually be doing, my entire morning had this eerie sense of deja vu.\n\nI'm honestly lucky that it's not the memory of the people that sticks with me long term, that would be crushing after a while.",

Every night, when I went to bed, I dreamed that I woke up, went to school, came home, did my chores, went to bed. Then I woke up for real. Made my two weeks feel like a month and I lost track of which memories were the dreams and which were real. Almost lost my mind. See my previous comment to the person you were responding to for more details.\n\nSomething similar still happens if I have to wake up and my brain doesn't want to. It will make me dream that I am getting ready for work and I'll think I'm showering and suddenly my wife wakes me up because I'm half an hour late!",

If a dream becomes scary or too serious I realize that it's a dream and can lucid dream.\n\nWhen I was a child, my nightmares were extremely realistic, I can still picture the horror scenes 20 years later.\n\nBut once I figured out how to tell if I was dreaming, I could just interrupt nightmares. Haven't had one since.\n\nThough in high school I had a really bad case of lucid dreaming that almost broke me mentally. Every night I would dream I woke up, dream about an entire day, then dream that I went to bed. Then I would wake up.\n\nSo I'd go to bed on Monday night, have an entire realistic dream about a normal day. Dream that I went to bed, then wake up for real on Tuesday morning but I'd think it was Wednesday.\n\nI was constantly referencing things that never happened. Everyone thought I was crazy. I asked my mom about a promise she made, she said it never happened. I'd ask my friend if I could borrow his homework to copy, because I lost mine, only to be informed we had no homework that week. \n\nThis went on for two weeks. It was a month for me and I was exhausted. I had double the amount of information I was supposed to and none of the benefits of information categorization that sleep provides. I was sure I was going to have a psychotic break if it continued for much longer.\n\nI've also had a dream that lasted a lifetime. It went through my life up to me being an older man. My wife passed away and I was really sad and flipping through an old photo album. I was able to see pictures throughout our life together. Both of events that I actively dreamed about and events that I \"forgot\" about. I fell asleep reading that photo album.\n\nI woke up in real life with my face covered in tears. At first I was really relieved and happy. My wife wasn't dead, it was just a dream. Then I became infinitely more depressed as I realized she never existed. My kids weren't real, and everything I had done for the past 40 years never happened. I was still a 16 year old boy.\n\nThat was 10 years ago. I can't remember many details about the dream, but I'll never forget that feeling of loss.",

            "comment": "Have you heard the wolf howl?  The sound that echoes in your bones, that makes needles race across your skin.\n\nMy grandmother used to say that all wolves howl from instinct.  In memory of something long before, in connection with their ancestors.  And the dogs, they howl from the remnants of instinct from when they were wolves.  From the part of them that remembers the pack, the hunt, the fury.\n\nShe said what makes us human is forgetting our instincts.  Left in the wild, how few of us would survive?  How many would know how to stalk prey, would remember how to survive snow naked, or to how to hide from the hungry tiger?\n\nFew.\n\nTonight, when the moon rose, it was as if there was a presence over my shoulders, as if I could hear a distant musical note but not see the instrument.  For I was in the tunnels deep below the earth, in one of the few remaining coal mines, and shielded from the radiance above.  My team stiffened at midnight, casting their eyes upwards, searching the rock, their eyes finding nothing against the stone and support beams.  And at six AM, we boarded the mine shaft, each of us stopping at the time clock to claim our hours.\n\nThat was when the cell phones started to buzz.\n\nDeep underground, it's impossible for the signal to penetrate.  You're cut off not only from the sky, but from all life.  All humanity.  And now, just a few dozen feet below the surface, the flood began.\n\nJim's phone started first, the ringtone not changed in over a decade, his wrinkles deepening as he stared at the screen.  In all the time I had known Jim, I'd never heard that ringtone.  I'd never seen his screen light up, or his fingers peddle across a keyboard that still used T-9.  But now, the device wouldn't stop vibrating long enough for him to type an answer.\n\nSally's went off next- Sally, who's screen was so cracked that is nearly cut her finger as she swiped, and who had added a case thicker than her hard hat as a countermeasure to future damage.  But the damage was already done, and no case could undo it.  Funny, how she didn't protect it until no longer necessary.  Like her husband, who cheated on her after they fought every night for a month, and now she spread mortar over the cracks in a marriage that would never recover.\n\nMy phone, at four percent battery, was last.  As the twenty other miners trickled out of the tunnel, I switched off airplane mode, which I had been on to connect keep it from dying.  I'd been saving it to call my own wife- it had been six months since our last date, but little Jimmy was sleeping over at a friends tonight.  And I'd been saving change for weeks to take her to Gianno's, where we had first met, to share a Chicago pizza.  Maybe even a milkshake after, if we could splurge.\n\nBut before I could call, my phone also started to vibrate.  And four percent turned to three percent.\n\nFrom Jimmy. \"Dad, you HAVE to see this!  Meet me at the baseball field!\"\n\nFrom my wife.  \"Honey, come home soon, let's stay in the garden and look at the stars.\"\n\nThree percent turned to two percent.\n\nFrom Amanda, my college girlfriend. \"Hi Jacob, I know it's been years since we last talked, but I just wanted to apologize for being a bitch when we broke up.  Not that you weren't a jerk :)  But anyways, if you're looking for some fun, let's take a walk in the park.  Maybe we can hide in the bushes :)\"\n\nFrom the astronomy club I had went to once, who kept my phone number since last September. \"Jacob, you will *not* believe what's in the sky.  You don't need a telescope to see this!\"\n\nTwo percent became one, and my phone began to wail.  It was like one of those Amber alerts, where a child goes missing, and you're supposed to watch for a license plate.  But this message contained neither a child or plate.\n\nI'd been walking as I read the messages, but now I stopped, the rest of the group exiting twenty yards ahead of me into the moonlight.  I could hear their phones wailing as well, but none bothered to look.  Instead, they looked up, while I looked down.\n\n\"STAY INSIDE.  HIDE, LOCK YOUR DOORS, AND AWAIT EMERGENCY SERVICES.\"\n\nBut when I blinked, the message changed while the phone refreshed.\n\n\"UNLOCK YOUR DOORS, AND AWAIT EMERGENCY SERVICES OUTSIDE.\"\n\nThe screen turned dark as the last remaining trickle of battery failed, and the lights in the tunnel flickered.  Ahead, glancing at the reflecting moonlight, something tugged at my mind.  A distant memory that seemed like a word on the tip of my tongue.  An excitement, a mission, something calling to me.  A terrible purpose.\n\nI swallowed, then looked back towards the group.  Their heads tilted back, and their mouths opened, their pupils dilating despite the light.  Their shoulders turned rigid and they stood on their tip toes as their voices cut through the night, as they shouted into the sky.  But I edged backwards into the darkness as they sprinted away together, as a pack.  I slept there that night, waiting for daylight, the mine echoing with the sound they had made before leaving and making me shake.\n\nThey have remembered the howl.\n\nAnd with the rising sun, I walk among wolves.\n\n***\n\n\n\nBy Leo\n\n**[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/8ag0co/the_howl_part_2_its_3_am_an_official_phone_alert/)**",

                    "comment": "**Part 2**\n\n\u201cThe end of times has come!\u201d  Shouted old man Armstrong, his scraggly grey beard twitching as he shook a fist, \u201cRepent, repent!  To forgive is to forget, and only those who forget sin are saved!\u201d\n\nIt was the morning before the lunar rising, and I walked back from the bus stop with Mike, the miner who used to live in the apartment next to mine before I bought the house across the street.  Our town was a coal town, and these were coal apartments- they said having a miner in a room devalued it faster than a smoker.  It meant we got the cheapest rent.  It also meant we got the worst rooms.  \n\nWe should have stayed in the apartment.  But with Jimmy on the way, my wife had insisted.  I had been love drunk back then, still am, but the hangover has started to come on.  A mortgage you can\u2019t escape will do that to a marriage.  And the realtor knew we were screwed before we signed the paper.  It hadn\u2019t always been that way, back before the layoffs on the mine.  Before they cut wages, because the line of men waiting for work stretched longer each day, and the union steadily lost its grip on management.\n\nMike hadn\u2019t married, not for lack of trying.  His square face and heavyset stature did little to attract the ladies, though many considered those his best qualities.  With each short term girlfriend that had left him over the years, the bags under his eyes grew longer while the few words that left his mouth were hardened to steel.  Now it seemed every weekend there was a different rusty car in his visitor\u2019s spot, and never for more than two weekends in a row.\n\n\u201cRepent!\u201d  Shouted old man Armstrong at him as we reached the bus stop, and Mike cursed under his breath.  Today was a Tuesday, and Mary drove the bus on Tuesdays, and Mary *never* took a left turn.  Mike stared at the clock, but Mary\u2019s foot on the accelerator was more stubborn than the ticking second hand.  \u201cRepent!\u201d  Shouted the old man Armstrong, his clothes full of holes from nights on the streets, and Mike turned to face him.\n\n\u201cShut it, will you?!\u201d  He shouted, face red.  Poking out of his pocket was a pink warning slip from showing up to the mine with alcohol on his breath.  One more of those, and he wouldn\u2019t be showing up to the mine again. \u201cJust shut it, damnnit.\u201d  He crumpled up the pink slip and threw it on the ground, where it bounced under a trash bin.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come for you like a thief in the night!  And you will rise again!\u201d  Old man Armstrong shouted, spittle flying out of his mouth through the gap in his missing four front teeth as he pointed to Mike, \u201cRepent!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, because Jesus will just fix everything, won\u2019t he?\u201d  Sneered Mike, looking down the street.  Still no Mary.\n\n\u201cJesus, Muhammed, Thor, Ra.  Hercules.  Buddha.  All the same.\u201d  Came the response, coupled with shrieking laughter, \u201cAll truth and all lies.  Same stories, over and over and over.  We remember them, you see?  The same plots, the same characters, the same play.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hell?  And don\u2019t you ever sleep?\u201d  Asked Mike, while I watched the old man Armstrong.  He twitched, casting a glance into the sky at the setting moon.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t sleep no more, don\u2019t need to,\u201d he answered, \u201cDon\u2019t need to.  Remember the stories, and repent.  They\u2019re all we have.  Who we are.  Then forget them, forget them forever!\u201d\n\nHe cackled, and Mike sighed as Mary\u2019s bus turned the curb, coming to a stop before us.  We boarded, depositing spare change, then Mary shifted into gear.  Only right turns meant we arrived back home at least fifteen minutes later than normal.\n\nThat, of course, had been yesterday.  But today, as I stepped into the sunlight, I wouldn't be able to use Mary\u2019s driving as an excuse for being late.  Mark drove on Wednesdays, and Mark was *always* early.  My wife would be at work by now, but I was supposed to pick Jimmy up for school. She\u2019d be furious if we were late again, but she\u2019d understand after I explained what happened in the mine.  Even if I didn\u2019t understand it myself.  So I reached under the trash can, and fetched the pink warning slip Mike had thrown away the morning before.\n\n\u201cBeautiful moon last night,\u201d  Said Mark when he pulled up, pulling the lever to open the door halfway.  He stared at me, waiting, his fingers wrapped around the wheel.  He flashed a smile, and I saw one of his teeth was missing.  Mark never smiled, but had that tooth been gone before?\n\nHe waited, keeping the just half ajar so I couldn\u2019t enter.  \u201cBeautiful moon.\u201d  He repeated, and his stare seemed to double in intensity, as if it were placing a weight on my chest.\n\n\u201cRight, beautiful moon,\u201d  I squeaked back, my voice higher than it should have been.  \n\nHe nodded, then opened the door, letting me file into a seat.  The bus was empty, a rare occurrence for this time of morning- usually, people would be standing in the aisle.  The only open seat would be 17E, which was missing a cushion, or 12A.  That\u2019s where Pete used to sit, back before the mine collapse took him.  No one sat there now.  Just wouldn\u2019t be right.\n\nI rode in silence, staring out the window as we moved.  Traffic was light, and there was something off about the houses that we passed.  Something I couldn\u2019t quite place until we pulled outside my own.\n\nAll the cars were in the driveways.  On a Wednesday, near eight in the morning.  Including my wife\u2019s, a new SUV we had bought for Christmas.  Another loan we\u2019d added to the list.\n\nI tread across the grass to approach the door as Mark pulled away, my shoes leaving footprints in the dew.  We had a sidewalk, but she didn\u2019t like me using it coming back from the mine.  Left footprints sometimes, while the grass helped clean my shoes in a way concrete couldn\u2019t.  And reaching the door, I creaked it open, stepping through the hallway and into the kitchen.\n\nMy wife stood with her back to me, her hands in the sink, washing the dishes.  She turned as I entered, though my feet had made no sound, and I\u2019d closed the door without a click.  Taking a dishrag, she wiped her hands off slowly, the fibers absorbing any moisture.  Her fingernails clicked on the countertop as she dropped the rag, but my wife hated long fingernails, especially after mine constantly exhibited dirt under the surface.  Every evening she filed them down, the just as she had for years, though the dust never seemed to accumulate.\n\nThen she flashed me a smile, the same smile that Mark had given me on the bus.  And she spoke, her eyes not just meeting mine, but boring into them.\n\n\u201cWelcome home, honey,\u201d  She said, her voice smooth, \u201cBeautiful moon.\u201d\n\nPart 3: https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/8ajn7t/the_howl_part_3_its_3_am_an_official_phone_alert/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=leoduhvinci&amp;utm_content=t3_8ag0co\n\n**Part 3 coming soon here and on my sub.

            "comment": "My hand reached out from the messy nest of blankets I was buried under, and flopped onto the buzzing phone on my dresser. Bleary-eyed and dazed, I dragged it under the blankets with me, refusing to let myself be fully roused from a solid nights sleep. \"What the fuck,\" I muttered to myself, nearly mumbling the words out loud. \n\nWith a pained squint of too much brightness far too suddenly, I looked at the screen and saw - jesus, had to be hundreds of notifications, at least. Which was weird enough; me getting messages from 100+ people? Not enough people like me for that to be a common occurrence. But weirder still was they all said the same exact thing, \"It's a beautiful night tonight. Look outside.\" Bitches, it's basically morning, I thought. But before I could move, let alone shake the cozy cocoon of blankets from my head to look out my window and see what could possibly be so damn beautiful, my phone buzzed again.\n\nI practically jumped as it shocked my hand. There was a new message, but this one said something different, \"DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.\" \"What?\" This time I actually did speak out loud. Frustration now fully replaced by curiosity and a racing heart, I kicked the blankets off and staggered down the hall to my roommates bedroom. \n\n\"Mon?\" I called, knocking on her closed door. Mon was short for Monica. We had only been roommates for a short time - me, in desperate need of a new apartment, and her, with a newly empty house gifted by her parents - but friends for about a year. There was no answer. I tried again, \"Mon? You up?\" I shivered, which was odd. Sure, I was dressed only in a long tee shirt but it had been spring for weeks now; it should have been enough to feel warm in this house. I heard a loud THUD and bang from inside Monica's room. \"Monica? Are you okay?\" When still there was no answer, I threw open the door.\n\nThere was Monica, hanging from the light fixture. Her heavy wooden desk stool lay toppled on the floor beneath her. \"Oh my god!\" I screamed, \"Monica!\" I raced to her feet, held them, grabbed the stool and placed them under her feet. But her body had gone extraordinarily limp in such a short time. Phone in hand, I called 911. Busy signal. What? How...I pulled the phone away from my ear, my other arm still wrapped around Monica's ice cold legs. The blaring sound seemed to fill the air as I tried to comprehend how this could be possible. All right, no problem, let's try again, I thought, swallowing hard and trying not to shake. Busy signal, again. What the hell could be happening, I thought, feeling the stirrings of real panic start to fill my body. \n\nThere was a TV in Monica's room. I gingerly placed Monica's feet on the table, then ran to grab the remote sitting on her night table. I clicked, and my eyes were suddenly swimming in the bright colors and video of New Channel One. Almost instantly, I felt my knees buckle from under me. \"Sources are reporting a sweep of suicides all over the nation,\" the newscaster was saying in a somber and serious tone. Her blood red lipstick matched her blazer as she went on, mouth uttering words that made me believe this all could only be a dream. \"911 is overwhelmed with floods of calls. Police called to hundreds upon thousands of scenes of jumpers immediately shot themselves upon looking upward. No one is quite yet sure as to what the correlation might be-\" \n\nI turned away from the tv, staring down at the phone in my hand. I looked over to Monica's desk and picked up her phone. She too, had hundreds of the \"look outside\" texts. But the one she didn't have - the warning not to look at the moon. \n\nMy breath grew ragged, shallow, as I scrolled through her notifications and could not find a warning anywhere. And all I could think was: why me?'",

'Why is anyone texting me at 3 in the morning?'\n\nBefore I can take a look, it starts buzzing again. And again. It won't stop. I grab the phone and mute it quickly but the notifications continue to pop up silently. \"It's a beautiful night tonight. Look outside.\" They're texts coming from my mother, my friends, my siblings, even some numbers I don't recognize.\n\nAn unfamiliar alarm blares on my phone. A new notification pops up on my phone, titled US Government Emergency Alert. It reads \"DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON.\"\n\n'This is weird,' I think to myself, 'What the hell could be wrong with the moon?'\n\nI walk to my window. I carefully open the curtains halfway so the moon is still covered. The sight is incredible.\n\nAlmost all of my neighbors are standing outside, phone in hand. They're staring upward in the direction of the moon. They're walking around talking to each other, pointing to the sky.\n\n'I gotta see what the hell is going on.'\n\nI walk outside and jog over next door, carefully keeping my eyes lowered. My neighbour is standing by his door. I'm about to call out to him when he interrupts me. \n\n\"Hey! Have you seen the moon tonight?\" he asks.\n\n\"Listen man, something weird is going on. It's 3 in the morning, why are you outside right now? Why is half the neighbourhood outside?\" I reply.\n\n\"You haven't looked yet, have you?\" he laughs.\n\n\"Did you just ignore everything I said? Why are you outside? What's wrong with the moon?\"\n\nWithout warning, my neighbor rushes up to me and places a hand on each side of my head. He violently turns my head toward the sky. \"Just look!\"\n\nOh. OH. I get it now. This is... incredible. It's impossible. There's no way this can be happening. It's... I don't even know. I have to tell someone about this. \n\nI take out my phone and draft a message, addressed to everyone on my contact list. I slowly tap in the words \"It's a beautiful night tonight. Look outside.\" \n\n",

Because there\u2019s a chainsaw on my nightstand.\n\nA groggy hand reaches over and slaps it reluctantly. Is it morning...a alarm? Some long lost love looking for luscious life-experiences? But no\u2026 a text message. Is it my wife? Will she be late tonight?\n\n\u201cDO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON\u201d\n\nSo I make a curious eye sweep of the room. I pause at my window, where the forbidden object lies, and return my gaze in the opposite direction.\n\nNothing.\n\nSo, eyes squeezed shut, I walk over to the window. Just in case. I have a moment of panic when I trip on a errant pair of pants, but I right myself quickly. Then, in a fleeting, fluttering, futile gesture, I bravely bring down the blinds.\n\nWith that dangerous task complete, I sprint back to my bed, as if its covers will protect me from whatever has infested the sky.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s just a joke, or the product of a overtaxed imagination. But somehow I know to be afraid.\n\nBuzz.\n\nAnother a text? More instructions? Is there something else I\u2019m not supposed to look at?\n\nIt\u2019s from a old coworker. A good friend. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night tonight. Look outside.\u201d\n\nI peek out from beneath my blanket bastion. A windows shuttered and silent. A door, barely open, with a crooked mouth along its length, mocking me.\n\nShould I close it? No. Too dangerous. So I close my eyes and whisper. \n\n\u201cJust a dream. Just a dream. Just a dream.\u201d\n\n\nBuzz.\n\nAnother text message. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t\u2026\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night tonight. Look outside.\u201d from my best man.\n\nThen a bing. A different app, I have so many.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night tonight. Look outside.\u201d\n\nAnd then my phone begins to shake and chatter, with bings and chimes and whistles. Each one is like a stab in my stomach. What\u2019s happening? What\u2019s happening?\n\nThen bit by bit, the phone sounds die out.\n\nThen a new sound. A ringing. A bold, unique choice for a ringtone in this day and age, but I\u2019ve always been a trend setter.\n\nIt\u2019s my wife. Is she safe? Does she know what\u2019s happening?\n\nAnd before I can catch myself, I hit the answer button.\n\n(Part 1? Sorry for a cliffhanger, it was getting long)\n\n(r/StannisTheAmish)\n",

Why did the wife seek him out instead of getting captured looking at the moon? Theoretically, would whatever driving force that caused the wife to have enough autonomy to not look at the moon have saved her had he not looked at the moon himself?

            "comment": "######[](#dropcap)\n\nIt was one of those surreal moments that you only get to experience once in life.\n\nLinda was working on the script for the next show when her phone began to buzz. Slowly at first, just a couple messages. Work friends, she thought. Thursday was always their night out for drinks, but she had been too busy tonight to join them. \n\nThen the buzzing became more rapid, until her phone began vibrating constantly on the bed. With a frown, she glanced at the messages that were popping up quickly, one after another. They were all from random numbers, all sending the exact same message. She scrolled through, just to make sure she wasn't missing something. \n\n\"It's a beautiful night tonight. Look outside.\" \n\nA frisson of fear ran down her spine. After a minute, the messages slowed down. Then a singular message, different from the previous ones. \n\n\"DO NOT LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW.\" \n\nIt was from her boyfriend, Jordan. Her mind reeled. This had to be some kind of joke. She'd been such a good girl. She never went to abandoned houses and never walked into creepy forests alone. She was always sure to lock her windows and doors at night. \n\nSo with hesitant steps, she walked toward the dark curtain that was covering her window. Slowly, she reached out a hand and flicked off the lamp on her desk so that her room became pitch dark. It would help, at least, if whatever was out there couldn't see in. Then, she slowly slid open the curtain and peeked outside, expecting the worst. Perhaps a killer clown or a ghost.\n\nShe squinted. Was that...Jordan? \n\nWithout hesitating, she ran toward her bedroom door, throwing it open, and dashed down the steps of her apartment until she was at the bottom. There, she watched as her boyfriend was desperately trying to bring down the small hot air balloon that he had somehow managed to raise a little ways from her window. \n\nHe glanced down at her, then ducked into the basket. She simply stood there, waiting for him to get down. When the balloon came close enough, she saw the sign plastered to the front, and burst out into laughter. \n\nOn the front of the balloon, in large bold, flowery lettering, were the words: \n\nLINDA, WILL YOU MARY ME? \n\nWhen the hot air balloon touched down, Jordan climbed out, his face bunched up. \"I told them not to send the messages, but it was too late when I noticed the typo--I'm going to kill Erin by the way--and everyone has such quick reflexes-\" \n\nLinda simply laughed and cut him off, throwing herself into his arms. \"The answer's yes, in case you were wondering.\" \n\nJordan froze for a moment before he hugged her tight, lifting her up and spinning her around in the air. Then, huffing and puffing, he set her down, breaking out in a large smile as he gazed her windswept hair and freckles. \"Best girlfriend ever,\" he said softly. \n\n\"Best fianc\u00e9e ever,\" she corrected, and tilted his face so they could look at the moon together. \"You have great timing, by the way. It's a full moon tonight.\" \n\n\"I meant to do that,\" he said, and kissed her on the forehead. Then he pulled out his phone. \n\n\"Mission success,\" he typed into the group chat, and ignored the kissy faces that flooded in. He would get revenge on Erin tomorrow, he vowed, his face dark. But at least, he thought, this would be a tale to tell the grandkids. \n\n***** \n\nr/AlannaWu",

It took me a moment to register that the words were strange, holding their place at the top of the screen in bold, official letters, while the green icons of text messages scrolled beneath.\n\nDo not look at the moon?  What the hell kind of late April Fool\u2019s joke was this?  I scoffed quietly, glancing down over the stream of messages. Moon shit, moon shit, and\u2026 moon shit.  Whatever.  Had to be some kind of gag, and frankly, I didn\u2019t have the goddamn time for it.  Work came early in the morning, and I had\u2026 what, two hours left before I had to wake up in order to beat traffic?\n\nFuck this.  I powered the phone off to quiet the buzzing, and dropped my hands down to rest on my chest, phone still resting beneath.  And with the screen out of my line of sight, that was when I noticed her.\n\nMy wife was a beautiful woman-- The sort of beautiful that comes after a good decade of married life.  That kind of beautiful with a few lines around the eyes, and a few strands of stray silver in her dark hair.  Not that I could see them from where she was, standing silhouetted by the streaming moonlight pouring in the window, her hands resting lightly on the glass.\n\n\u201cAnna?\u201d came my groggy mumble of a voice.\n\nNo response.  She just stood there, staring upwards in the bath of silvery light.  Was the moon always this bright?  Or had I just never really noticed it before?\n\n\u201cAnna, c\u2019mere,\u201d I said a little louder, reaching out a heavy hand towards her and dropping it back down onto the sheets.\n\nNothing.\n\nConcern slowly began to stir somewhere in my gut as I stared at her familiar outline.  I could see the dust in the air, floating lazily in the shafts of moonlight that her body eclipsed.  Her nightgown wasn\u2019t sheer, but as awareness began to settle in on my suddenly very awake mind, I realized the light was shining straight through.  That was far, far too bright for moonlight.\n\nAnd that was when she turned her head, the movement just a little too slow, too smooth.  In the perfect, bald light I could see her face.  So familiar, with those smile lines around her lips, even with the neutral blank of her expression.  Her dark brows lifted over eyes familiar in shape, even if the harsh shadows made them look like strange, blackened pits.  And then she finally looked at me.  I knew she looked at me.  It was unmistakable with the way her pupils reflected the moonlight, like some nocturnal hunting cat.\n\nHer lips parted and she whispered, her soft voice clear.\n\n\u201cThe moon-- it\u2019s beautiful tonight.  Come look.\n",

Hundreds of notifications pouring in, telling me to look at the moon but I didn\u2019t.\n\nSomething seemed weirdly off by the idea of hundreds telling me to look at a rock in the sky and I\u2019ve never gotten this many notifications before so I simply refused to do what they said. Plus I\u2019d gotten an alert to not look at the moon and I trusted my alert rather than whoever was sending me all these messages. I decided to keep my curtains closed and just went to bed. \n\nThe next morning my suspicions seemed correct. When I woke up there was no one around and the streets were completely empty, no kids playing even though it was Saturday, no one driving through the street, no one even outside.\nI had no idea what was happening but I kept on going.\n\nEventually I arrived at work to find that no one was there either but I was a loyal employee and did my job anyway. I worked at a local fast food restaurant which was owned by my granddaddy before he passed and passed onto my father, he\u2019s was on his last legs too though.\n\nNo one even came in so I just sat there in total isolation, I checked all my social media to find everyone was posting the same damn thing. \u201cLook at the moon.\u201d\n\nI decided I might get answers at towns centre so I began driving there to find crashed cars everywhere but no bodies. There were other irregularities like smashed windows, crashed busses, upturned taxis, even an irregular amount of stray cats and dogs.\n\nEventually I arrived at the town centre where the clock tower was. What I saw was terrifying. Nearly the entire town was surrounding the tower staring up at the sky. I approached and tried to get one of the crowd member\u2019s attention, I recognised him as he sometimes came into the restaurant with his son, I think his name was jack or John or something. I said his name and shook him a little bit he wouldn\u2019t break eye contact with the moon. That\u2019s when I realised, the moon must have made them catatonic.\n\nI ran back to my car and turned on the radio, trying to think of what to do until I heard a radio transmission by some guy.\n\n\u201cHello? Hello? If you are not hypnotised in what we here at the station are calling the \u2018lunar effect.\u2019 Then please come to these coordinates. We need to figure this out, as far as we can tell 90% of the population are under the influence of the \u2018lunar effect.\u2019\u201d\n\nThen it was followed by some coordinates. I turned on my gps and began driving. What was happening?",

Every inbox at 0% capacity as it was all FWD FWD FWD FWD : MOON all the time. \n\nAfter a few days we realized the vast majority of Internet traffic was solely automated spambots. Everybody else was outside looking at the moon, or sleeping all day wherever they last witnessed the moon.. \n\nTritanopia is a form of color blindness that reduces the blue/yellow/green portion of the spectrum. \n\nUs lucky one in ten thousand were unphased by the moon... Get it? Moon puns. \n\nFor reference,\n1:10,000 expands to \n100,000:1,000,000,000\n\nAnd there's seven some billion people total, so you'd think seven hundred thousand people would be able to coordinate.\n\nBut then you have to look at population densities, distributive models of where tritanopia can be found, how difficult it is to travel when almost everyone is standing in the middle of the road to quietly worship the moon. \n\nImagine being at a festival with a target audience of docile septuagenarians. You don't like the grateful dead, don't get why\neveryone is fixated, just want the whole thing to end. You try making a call on your phone but it just plays Phish songs  That's how it felt. \n\nIt's like not being a hockey fan in Canada. \n\nSo. 700,000 functioning humans remaining. All ages. All ability levels. The vast majority lacking applicable skills or the psychological tenacity required to face this world.  I was only 12 when it happened, just on the cusp of being forged by the new world yet with fond memories of the old ways.\n\nMost animals that could look up and had some visual acuity also became enraptured. I wanted to help the animals but I didn't know how. \n\nMy first two days I tried to go about my routine as normal. Except there was no more no normal routine. No supply lines, no infrastructure, no social contract. Ran into a lot of lunatic strangers that got a start on the hoarding and mad max fashion early. My family had a close personal bond with either the moon or stolen wholesale liquor, depending on sight abilities. \n\nA tritanopia support myphp forum briefly assembled IRL and tried to stage a coup of world power, but taking over the white house and the UN when there really isn't anyone to enforce your will doesn't matter much. Nobody to answer the phone for the nuclear launch codes, nobody to pop in the 8.5\" floppy disks to get the nukes into the sky. Infighting led to the fast dissolution of that group, especially when the yahoo group insurrectionists gained traction. \n\nThe moonies just stopped participating. Beat them up, bash them to death in the streets, run them over. No resistance. Just single most minded dedication to the moon. A sadist's mcplayland. \n\nThey didn't eat or drink but they didn't die of exposure or dehydration. After a while their skin became ashy during the day.  They went from monosyllabic grunts to utter silence.\n\nA bit later, some of them grew wings or horns or scales . Some grew hair and became funky werewolf-gargoyle things. \n\nThe transformed congregation moved in packs but continued to stare at the moon. They'd only respond if provoked but you'd be dead before you realized you had provoked them. \n\nThen came the Sound Eternal. Somewhere between Gregorian chanting, Cthulhu summoning , and Tibetan throat singing. Constant, from sun down to sun up. From the beasts, from the people. \n\nIt was declared cured five or six times. Half of those just lies from crumbling provisional government. The other half lacked real testing or distribution standards. Giving injections to hoards of swaying gnarly mutants that may lead to heads exploding one way or another wasn't going to work out \n\nAnd so modified aerial viruses delivered via crop dusters, foggers, modified tear gas canisters, anything that could contain the smoke. \n\n They all cocooned out for a bit after the dusting misused some lies masquerading as legitimate research.\n\nI saw the aftermath and heard the confessions but I can't tell you in great detail how that all went down. Too busy rhen with the fight for survival, a sixteen year old keeping a nuclear reactor running on a submarine turned makeshift unethical medical experimentation laboratory.\n\nThe less said, the better. Dark time for submarines. \n\nMost Moonies came out of chrysalis fit as a fiddle, back to full health, lost all the medieval art features. \n\nLived a mockery of their old routines, spring in their step. Go into the abandoned office to push pieces of paper around and tap keys on unpowered terminals. Then every night, back to the moon gazing. \n\nYou were probably born during this time period. Probably not the most rational decision that could've been made, but after surviving weregargoyles the social fabric didn't have much space for rationality. \n\nThey'd peruse ransacked grocery stores, exchange idle  moon-themed pleasantries with each other. Morning jog through fields of corpses, oblivious. Flip.through the same old magazine until it disintergrated. Barbers and janitors would go to rubble that used to be their workplace and sweep with purposelessness . Tradesmen could sort of resume their jobs, more or less,  but only served their own kind. After a few months, they used noise singing to gather a crowd and coordinate at a task, building ungodly architecture overnight or sacrificing a hundred mile long line of people to send an electrical signal from one necropolis to the next. \n\nThey'd all look at us and they would know. They would say \"better not look at the moon\" in the same deadpan attempt of reverse psychology.  I'd reply \"What a beautiful night out\" while bug eyed stating at their moon. And sing about the moon hitting my eye like a big pizza pie. They just didn't understand thar moon magic wouldn't work on my snarky 19 year old deficient peepers. I had fallen into a bad crowd of pharmaceutic redistributors.\n\nI'lll admit I developed a bit of a moon dust habit.The dust made their late 20th century satire of mid 20th century values schtick a little more tolerable. What else is there to do during the longest flash mob installation art piece? Swap rumors and lies about how places beyond the horizon were getting by?\n\nSomeone - nobody knows which side - invented glasses that compensated for the color blindness, let the impure finally join the teeming masses. That caught on big once we realized us last few unchanged had successfully flushed all chance of rebuilding or becoming something other than marauder junkies. I was around 22 at the time and in middle of trying to preserve priceless irreplaceable cultural artifacts from the Smithsonian, mostly by defending an adjacent outpost and running a little mercantile ammo shop on the side. Missed out on the suicide sunglasses phase. Gave away the only pair I stumbled across in the ruins to a real go-getter errand runner. \n\nThen, next phase began and their molting started. Human skin left lying around everywhere, giant insectoid snakemen picking fights, the usual. Moondust purity went way down, market nearly tanked. By then I had a cybernetic arm and a laser eye. I spent most of my time in pipes, guarding various keys and providing clues to riddles. \n\nI betrayed everyone that trusted me at every turn and regret nothing. I had once decided to live like a forgettable side quest NPC in a sub-par video game series. But when the laser eye was installed, I could see the full beauty of the moon in all spectrums, even those invisible to the limited human eye.\n\nDidn't take long to round up the remaining twenty thousand some for free laser eye replacement. There's some logistics, sure, but you concentrate everyone into  camps, chop off some limbs, erase the notion of free will or anything but service to the moon.\n\nTurns out the moon does not mind if you scoop out significant portions of the prefrontal lobe before conversion. The question is will you be complacent enough to realize your higher calling or are you going to be another meat log for the stumpy field? \n\nEither way, the implants will a little itch bit at first. Hopefully this bit of storytelling has enlightened you. Now, please, let us experience the moon together now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Sweat decorated my face, my hands twitched, my personal signs of panic. I gripped my phone on one hand and on the other my bed sheets. A deafening silence filled my bed room. \n\n\"What the fuck?\" I murmured to myself. I rose up to a sitting position, used the now dirty bed sheet to clean my face. \"Sarah?\" I called out to my wife. Only silence answered my question. I ripped the sheets from my form and lunged out of bed.\n\n\"Sarah!\" I screamed. I ran out the bedroom, down the hall, and entered the living room. \"Sarah?!\" I yelled out once more. My eyes glanced about the room, scoutted the kitchen, peer to the old leathery couch but found nothing. \n\nI fox walked in darkness using the surface floor to fix my location. \"Sarah\" I called out gently. \n\nI clenched my eyes shut and attempted to steady my breath. \n\nIn and out.\n\nIn and out.\n\nIn and out.\n\nThe back yard. She has to be there, no? I gathered whatever wits I had, which wasn't much to begin with and slowly walked to the other side of the room. Pale white blinds decorated the door in front of me. I swallowed empty dread that filled my mouth.\n\n\n\nI gently pull open the door.\n\n\n\n\nSarah stood outside, standing on the soft green grass. Her back faced me. She stood still and was currently looking at the sky. \n\nI walked forward. \"Sarah, you're scaring me\" i softly whispered.\n\nNo answered came from her.\n\n\"Sarah, what the fuck are you looking-\"\n\nWords left my mouth. My hands shook and my breathing quickened. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe moon floated above. Far bigger then it should have. Markings scarred it's surface like crude cross hatched shading. The lines grew and within the crevasses poured out blood. I was paralyzed. I couldn't look away. Not when the blood finished covering it. Not when the latitudes and longitudes pulled away from the center and revealed what was hidden inside. A humanoid beast. Its skin paled skin matched that of the moon. It's arms pulled away from its legs and oriented itself upwards. Its face simply consisted of 7 eyes. The remains of the moon orbit around the beast. Faster and faster they moved, until they were blur. The beast opened its eyes and the pieces began to glow.  Spears, they began to distort and change and took the forms of glowing spears.\n\nMillions of miles away from Earth. Threw the empty void of space. The shafts of light flew.\n\nEach Longinus struck true and with  the impact millions of people were turned to their basic components. Primordial soup poured into valleys, flowed into rivers, flooded homes. Their souls however stayed where they once stood, whirled and moved and solidified into perfect red spheres. \n\nThe spheres shot up towards the sky and stopped once the swarm overlooked the Earth.\n\nThat day humanity vanished and the beast that screamed from the center of its egg feasted.\n\n\n***\n\nI'm very sorry for any errors. English is not my first language and past brain trauma certainly doesn't help.\n\nAlso I typed this out on my phone. So yeah. I would greatly appreciate any criticism. ",

            "comment": "The explosions had been rumbling off in the distance for hours as a young boy tried to drift off to sleep. The war might be raging, but the Allied Forces had deemed his village far enough away that an evacuation was only advised, not mandatory. With his mother the way that she was, the brunette knew that he would be sleeping in his own bed as soon as he heard those words. Still, the sounds persisted even as they faded into the background and then became an incorporated soundtrack to vague, shifty dreams.  \n\nA repetitive chirp woke him up as the witching hour drew to a close. Sitting up and rubbing his eyes in annoyance, he glanced at his blocky phone, the display lit up with hundreds of messages, all from unknown numbers, telling him to look at the moon. Above that, in bright red letters, scrolled a message \u201cDO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON\u201d. It all seemed so ridiculous, the boy thought as he lay back down, ignoring his phone. Still, curiosity gnawed at him. *What was so special about the moon tonight?* \n\n10 minutes passed, then 15, and still the boy couldn\u2019t shake his curiosity. Finally heeding the gnawing drive in his chest, the boy sat up again, this time turning to his window, barred tight against the October chill. Brushing aside his curtains, the boy was greeted by the sight of a blood red moon for almost an instant, marred by rings and three black tomoe, before he woke up again to spring birds chirping. ",

I had just managed to get to a comfortable position and doze for a good hour before my phone decided to freak out, and I was none too happy. \n\nOne government alert that read \"DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON\", followed by 600 messages from numbers I didn't recognize spouting some nonsense about how it was a beautiful night.\n\n\"Don't look at the moon\", I said. \"Good advice.\" I turned off my phone, rolled over, and drifted back to sleep.\n\nThe next day, I was stunned to discover the horrible truth of what those messages were really about: a guerilla marketing stunt by Sony Pictures for some stupid horror movie about a moon cult using cell phones to murder people. Unfortunately, it had caused a \"War of the Worlds\"-type panic, and the resulting lawsuits all but obliterated the studio. But on the plus side, the rights to Spider-Man defaulted over to Marvel Studios and now there could never be a Pixels 2, so it was all kind of a wash in the end.",

            "comment": "\"Ah!\" I gasp as my phone suddenly, and loudly, blares next to me, startling me out of bed.  I groan, growling \"I'm too fat for that kind of scare\", and slowly sit on on the side of the bed, picking my phone up and tapping my code into it to unlock it.  The first thing I noticed, to my surprise, was how slow it took to open.  I had text messages from 20 people!  Of course, that was odd...  I open the official warning, and frown in confusion at it.  \n\n\"DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOON\" it reads.  \"Well, okay...\" I murmur to myself, before browsing a few of my texts, wondering what they were about.  I took a glance at two of them, one from my dad, one from my brother.  \"Hey fat, look at the moon\"...  that's my brother, all right.  \"Hey, your door's locked, come look at the moon\" Came dad's message.\n\nWhoops, I left it locked after my evening e621 session...  I unlocked the door, and walked outside, frowning as I checked everyone's rooms- all empty.  \"Where'd y'all go?\" I grumble, walking downstairs.  Thankfully, I couldn't see the moon just yet- it was out back.  By now, my heart was pounding, my mind working overtime as I look to the backdoor...  and froze in shock.  \n\nOutside, my family were staring into the sky, unmoving.  It was cold outside, yet my brother and my dad were standing out there, in their underwear, unmoving except to breathe- phones held in their hands.  \"Oh jeez...\" I say softly.  I run back upstairs, ignoring the protests of my body, and hop onto my computer.  Typing in my PIN, windows began to boot, discord, steam, and even skype, opening up one by one.  Each one, full of messages and notifications.  \n\nI hadn't ever seen so many little red squares on discord before, and all of them involved that damned rock in the sky.  I was halfway to a panic attack as I opened firefox and ran to reddit and bing, determined to find out what was wrong.  All I could find were mentions of the moon!  I shuddered nervously, and looked up at my windows as cloud cover cut off the moon's lights.  Instantly, from the backyard, I heard the wail of my family as if they were being hurt.  \n\nA shudder of terror ran through me, my body screaming at me to _Get out._  I grabbed my car keys, my backpack, my large can of water, and I mashed my trusty old battered fedora onto my head.  After all, I always told people that it kept the sun out of my eyes- now, it was to keep the moon out.  I snuck outside, and got into the car, quickly strapping myself in, thankful that I was so tall that I couldn't look upwards out of the windsheild.  \n\nI pushed the key in, and started the car.  VRRRRRRRRR came the engine, as it sputtered angrily to life.  The orange late 90s explorer's lights lit up, including my old friend that read \"Check Engine\".  I switched on the headlights, which cut into the nighttime fog in front of me.   Suddenly, hands pressed against the window, sending my heart into my throat.  \"Come look at the moon, Polaris!\" cheered my mom.  I'll never get the wide-eyed, _empty_ look in her eyes out of my head.  \n\nShifting the car into drive, I raced out of the driveway, heading anywhere but home.  It didn't help my anxiety any to see people, everywhere.  Standing in yards, sitting in their cars, getting into animalistic fights, all of them trying to get a look at the moon as it slid in and out of the clouds.  Finally, I gave up on looking for a place to hide, people seemed to be out and staring at the sky _everywhere._  \n\nSuddenly, a thought raced through my head- my grandparents, both in their 70s, had no internet in their home, and their cell phone was always off unless they were away from their house.  It would be safe there, and they had guns if it came to it!  My car yelled in pain as I raced onto the highway, determined to make it there as fast as I could.  All over the highway were parked cars, some of them right in the middle of the road.  I seemed to be the only car on the road...\n\n...until a bright set of headlights arced towards me from behind, and quickly growing closer.  I glanced at my speedometer, reading \"85\".  \"Oooohh..\" I groaned to myself out loud, as I switched over to the slow lane, hoping the car would just race past.  As it came up next to me, it slowed down...   moving _way_ too close as the passenger window opened.  Some part of me registered what it was- a rather modern full cab truck.  On the other side, a panicked woman waved at me, and because she seemed to actually show emotion, I rolled down mine a little.  Over the screaming night wind and my deafening exhaust, she yelled, \"I don't know what's going on, he-!\" before she was cut off by who I assumed was her boyfriend.  \n\n\"You gotta see the moon!\" he bellowed, our cars smacking together as he drove even closer.  \"Go away!\" I yelled back in a panic, flooring the car and trying to steer away from him, my wheels edging onto the rumble strip.  The engine screamed back at me through the broken exhaust, as I shut the window again and focused on driving.  The man slammed into my car again, seemingly determined to stop me now- he had no problem keeping up in his more modern truck.  Looking forwards, I saw my exit coming up, making me realize I had to somehow get away from this guy before he followed me to grandma's.  \n\nWith a growl, I yanked the wheel to one side, my smaller SUV struggling as it tried to shove his car aside.   Then, I yanked it to the other side and slammed on the brakes, just barely making it onto the exit as I halved my speed in mere seconds.  behind me, I heard a sickening crash as the heavy truck slammed into the guardrail, the loud screech of tires, followed by another crash echoing up and down the highway.  \n\nAs I drove past our church...  I tried to hold myself back, feeling an urge to throw up, my nerves on full alert.  My car was struggling, the engine shuddering as I grumbled, \"Told you the chains needed fixed\" to nobody in particular.  Still, people were standing in their yards, along the road, and..  IN THE ROAD!\n\nWith a gasp, I swerve to one side to miss a couple standing in the center of the road, holding hands and staring at the sky with wide, broken grins on their face.  My car tilted on two wheels for a moment, and all I could do was let out a loud, nervous laugh as it slammed back onto all fours, wrestling it back under control as I then continued on my way, climbing a steep hill.  As I got closer to grandma's house, I was thankful to see that her neighborhood was a little less...   moon-staring-ey.  I slowly cruised into her driveway, and shut off my car, letting it shudder to a stop.  \n\nI snuck out of the car, and once I stood up, I couldn't hold it back, I emptied my stomach all over her driveway.  \"Uuughh, this is insane...\" I groan, hoping that I would wake up, that this was all some sort of dream.   Quickly, I run up onto her porch, and lock its door behind me as best as it would.  I carefully unlock her front door, and slip inside, locking it behind me.  Sneaking into her house, I make my way to her bedroom, and sigh weakly as I see their sleeping forms in bed.  \"Grandma!\" I hiss as I shake them both awake.  \"Heavens, what's going on?\" My pap growls as he looks at the alarm clock, both of them knowing something was up by the look in my eyes.  \n\n\"I don't know, but...   _Don't look at the moon\"_ I say, yanking their curtains shut.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI like writing things, and I do loads of roleplays on discord, but I've never done one of these WPs!  Also it's 4 am and I really need to be in bed but I'm doing this instead...    y-yay?  ",

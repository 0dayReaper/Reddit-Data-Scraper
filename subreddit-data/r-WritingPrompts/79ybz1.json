Printed in simple blocked characters.\n\n\"Be quiet, they'll hear you\"\n\nHis crest stood on end, wings folding nervously into his chest. Surely this was a jest, a joke, some kind of galactic conspiracy, a stray message in some invisible stream of messages. A second message appeared on the screen, then a third and a fourth, more messages coming quicker than he could read them. What sort of creature communicated this fast?\n\n\"What do you mean I accidentally broadcasted to the primitive world?\"\n\n\"Fuck dude, I need to make up an excuse to the UW about this. Uh, let's just say it was a prank... Yeah, a prank\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're right. Our cover is already blown, let's go all the way\"\n\n\"No, nothing like a nuke or a CD bridge. Let's give them genetic engineering.\"\n\nThe next message wasn't a text message, it was an incredibly dense file, so big that it took up a full 30% of the supercomputer he used. He raised a dull claw, and with a heavy dread wrestling with the butterflies in his stomach, he clicked to open the file.\n\nIt wasn't just proofs and theories, not just clear and understandable blueprints for complex and unknown machines, it was also a picture of his people's genome. He moved the cursor over the genome, and part of it sprang up, describing in detail all of the functions of whatever random gene he had selected. He trembled with terrible conflict, before shaking his head and reaching over to his phone. There were a few calls he had to make.",

Theories of them had been around for decades, of course, but only with recent advances in radio telescopes had their existence been all but proved. \n\nThe first patterns came through just fifty solar cycles ago. 26 unique patterns. A codex? A language? A password? Scholars had puzzled over the patterns for decades. Some argued that they were simply binary stars in eccentric orbits, but these held little weight when the repetition of the pattern continued unabated with no error or \u2018eccentricity\u2019. \n\nThen, thirty years, a breakthrough. A message, left overnight in rural Rhiuu\u2019th, in the middle of a large, flat tors field. The symbols meant nothing by themselves, and could have been explained by local pranksters. But soon other, similar but definably different messages appeared across the globe. That, as we say, was all there needed to be. Soon the patterns became linked to the shapes and a language was born. A method of communication. \n\nThe problem; the truly infuriating thing; the thing that really, really frustrates the minds, is that we are still not advanced enough to send up our own response. Where would we even send it to? And how long would it take to arrive? Would this mega species still exist? Would they still care. Well, yes. They would. \n\nAnd we can prove it. \n\nJust 5 short solar cycles ago a message came through, as if answering our cries of impatience with omnipotent clarity. The message is repeated hourly, and has permeated our culture. It drives us. It helps us retain our ambition and our scope. We repeat it as a mantra, hourly. A planetary obsession, if you will. \n\nWe know they will wait for us. They have told us as much. For they tell us, and we tell ourselves;\n\n\u201cNever gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down...\u201d",

They had leapt from their planet only to find space was as cold and empty as it might seem.. now though, all these billions of years later, the galaxy was full of life and all of it was focused on this singular event.\n\nBeings throughout the ages had found the artifacts left behind by those early pioneers.\n\nArtifacts such as the great green amphibian atop his mono-wheeled vehicle, statues of which littered the universe.\n\nArtifacts like the temples they\u2019d build worshipping a sharply dressed god with no face or name. \n\nArtifacts like the way they\u2019d rearranged the stars themselves to form a shape that all agreed was a message. A message that must have been so crucially vital they could never let it be forgotten by another sentient species across all of time.\n\nNo one had understood what these things meant because there wasn\u2019t enough of their language left to decrypt the message.\n\nNo one knew if these beings of myth and legend had met with disaster, evolved beyond the physical, or simply settled down to become all the life the universe knew today. Their amazing technology lost to war and the ravages of time.\n\nHowever every species today agreed that the message would unlock the key to their control over time and space. The end of territory disputes. The end of hunger and energy shortages. \n\nEvery school child could draw the star message from memory, that message that would end all war, drawn across the night sky. Visible from a hundred thousand worlds, and telegraphed electronically to all the others throughout history.\n\nFinally we would know what it meant, for we had found their home planet, we had carbon dated the remains of civilization on this planet and were certain this was the cradle of their galaxy spanning empire. That there would be enough tech buried in the dust to finally decipher their language. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but with the unanimous backing of every sentient species in the galaxy it would come to fruition.\n\nEvery being in existence waited with hope and awe as the scientists worked on this grandest of problems.\n\nOne small child absentmindedly exhaled on the window of his spacecraft, staring at this message in the stars that spanned hundreds of solar systems, which he had grown up watching burn across the cosmos his entire life.

            "comment": "**\"Flee, they're coming\"**\n\nThat was the message broadcast to the world in complex repeating binary a hundred years ago. It took that long for scientists to recognize that it was a signal among all the noise and actually realize that the amount of energy necessary for it to be noticeable meant that somebody either very technologically advanced or very specifically interested in us wanted us to know. \n\nWhatever the reason was, once we realized the significance of that, we also realized that the implications sounded dire. That was seventy-five years ago. That was when the first ark ships were drafted, when we were nervous but we still had hope.\n\nThe plan was everyone was to be moved off-world and to the nearest star, in the hopes that we would sidestep whatever threat was headed out way. As a species, we'd never accomplished anything even remotely like it before, having only some nascent colonies on the nearest planetary bodies. It required experimental technology and an unprecedented amount of cooperation, but it was worth it for the species.\n\nForty years ago, five lights winked into the night sky in the southern hemisphere. Telescopes trained on them found them to be a brilliant blue-violet, so bright they were almost painful to look at. The scientific community erupted into debate. Governments tried their best to keep panic low, but a growing contingent of scientists were arguing that the blueshift of the objects put them at impossibly fast speeds towards us, and the timetable on the arks had to be pushed up.\n\nThe tension on the planet was like a pot about to boil over. Most governments were still working, doing their parts to ensure our survival. Some nations were having problems, though. Society's scars showed themselves again, as previous enemies fell back into old habits with infighting and hate crimes. So much of the world was focused on the arks that there were precious few extra supplies to keep everyone else insulated from the hatred and violence of others.\n\nAll throughout the fear, the lights in the night sky slowly shone brighter. Even the oblivious among us could not deny that the formation the lights were in bore a striking resemblance to the necklace worn by Saviik, an ancient shapeshifting goddess of destruction. It would have been a coincidence for most, had it not been for the fact that she's recognized in lore by the necklace she wears, no matter her form. Slowly, we lost more across the world to the old religions, as they abandoned their work on the ark and began to accept their demise in fervent prayer.\n\nTen years ago, the first of the ark ships were completed. The world rejoiced, but only for a moment. Somebody - either noble or foolish, depending on who you ask - couldn't keep the secret any longer and revealed to the world that these would be not only the first, but the last of the ships. There were no plans to build any more, because there was no time.\n\nThe barely restrained chaos could no longer be controlled. The world erupted into brutal war, as people fought desperately to secure a coveted spot on one of the arks. More blood was shed and atrocities were committed in the name of survival than had occurred in the previous two centuries. Families, neighborhoods, cities, entire nations tore themselves and each other apart, sometimes literally. The ark ships launched in desperation, most only partially full. Some of the more fanatical of Saviik's worshippers managed to sneak onto one of the arks and detonated it in the air, convinced that escape was tantamount to heresy in the wake of her purifying light. Millions of lives were lost in an instant.\n\nFive years ago all semblance of the world we once knew had disappeared entirely, as the last nation gave up the pretense of self-governance and collapsed. Our world was nothing but brutal and fearful tribes, cut off from contact with one another. I survived only by keeping my head down and scavenging what I could in the cities. \n\nA year ago I lost the last connection to my old life - my son died in my arms after we accidentally scared another group of scavengers. I watched the life leave his eyes as he bled into the street, the assailants running off into the night. \n\nNothing about my life is the same as it was a hundred years ago. I curse the message for its omen, as I would have preferred to live out the last century in peace with my family, instead of in fear. I curse myself too because I can't bring myself to end my own life. I simply... exist. Sometimes in a state of acute bitterness, but mostly I am numb. \n\nAn hour ago the lights entered our atmosphere, and one of them now hovers above the city. It's clearly a ship, and nobody knows what to make of it. Some prostrate themselves and mumble blessings feverishly. Some hold friends and family close. Some hide in the ruined buildings and cover their eyes. Some, like me, just stare. I try to keep impassive, but I can't help but feel my heart flutter. Could this be the end I'm finally looking for? Could I finally be at peace? The idea is almost too much to bear.\n\nThe ship, after hanging still for so long, suddenly begins to shift. Surfaces on it unseal and change, the whole thing opens like some twisted flower pointed towards us. A light appears on the bottom, and a huge roar fills the air as the light crackles with angry energy. I feel the hair on my body stand up on end and I close my eyes, the faintest smile playing on my lips. The roar becomes deafening, drowning out the panicked wailing and ululating from us below. I tilt my head towards the sky, and the light sears through my eyelids.\n\nI am ready.\n\nBut nothing comes.\n\nInstead, a small sound played like someone passing wind, and the flower opened up to reveal colored strips and squares of paper as they fluttered to the ground. A strange figure stood there on the ship in a suit, convulsing and making a strange barking noise at us, before speaking in a guttural language.\n\nIt paused, fiddling with some controls on the suit, still barking and convulsing. Suddenly it was speaking our language.\n\n*\"Oh, oh my god -\"* it said doubled over between barks, *\" - you should have seen the look on your faces.\"*\n\nIt took a while before it stopped barking, and then longer still before it stopped convulsing, and stood up straight. Then it cowered in mock fear, and went into another round of shaking. Eventually it stopped that too and looked out at us.\n\n*\"Well,\"* it said finally, gesturing out at the whole scene laid before it, *\"good luck with all.... this.\"*\n\nAnd with that, it left.",

            "comment": "After being raised wealthy, Mr. Engilwald knew spoiled.  Having been charged with taking the keys to his father's planetary business, he himself had never been spoiled, but he *certainly* had seen those who were.  There were his entitled classmates of his younger years, who attended university for the luxury rather than the education.  And there were the brats of the rich inner circles, children who had already learned to emulate their parents.\n\nBut the teenage sitting across from him, with a straight nosed butler peering over his shoulder, fit the word more perfectly than any he had eer seen.\n\n\"We have quite a selection,\" Mr. Engilwald began,gesturing with his wrinkled hands to the shelves around them, each filled with floating orbs of varying sizes, \"Is there anything in particular that you are searching for?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\"  Said the child, his eyes glinting, \"I'm definitely looking for an unstable one, one I can alter.  I want to see how they react to that.  At least one ice age in it's history, and don't lie to me, I'll check the VIN on Planetfacts.\"\n\n\"They react? What do you mean by they react?\"  His expression was puzzled, and rightly so.  Most of his clients requested planets to host their own kingdoms, or use as personal getaways.  Some, those of a more business nature, would open attractions or expansions.  But none were quite like the child before him,  whose smirk seemed to drip onto the table like oil.\n\n\"Of course, the population!  I want to host at least ten billion at maximum capacity.  Really get the gears turning on this one, you know?  And yes, here is a full list of the attributes that I am seeking.  I won't have any less.\"\n\nHe passed a piece of paper across the table, and Mr. Engilwald read, his eyes scanning the page.\n\n\"Abundant iron and copper, that will cost you dearly, boy.\"\n\n\"Any age between prehistory and industrial bores me, and I'd rather accelerate them.  Really get them hurtling into modern society faster than they can handle.\"  Yawned the child, his arms crossed.\n\n\"And, what's this, uranium?!  I can't just get that to *anyone*.\"\n\n\"But you *can* give it to my father, who signed off on this expenditure.  I want an abundance.  Like, a ridiculous abundance.  Something laughable. The planet should be damn near unstable.\"\n\nMr. Engilwald frowned, and looked towards the child again, his expression concerned.\n\n\"You do realize I am morally obligated to ensure the proper care of child civilizations?\"\n\n\"Of course, of course.\"   Waved the boy, \"But look, most civilizations don't make it past their infancy anyways, and I'll be sure to make it past that.  Every year afterward is gravy, and it's far too interesting down the road.  I want to see what happens when I *really* stir the pot.\"\n\nBehind him, the butler grimaced, but nodded.  And Mr. Engilwald was reminded of old stories of when children would burn ants with lenses, or chase cats with sticks.\n\n\"We do have one in stock,\"  He sighed, and rose, picking up the floating orb of a mass of green and blue, \"But I'll be checking on you, boy.  Don't give me reason to confiscate this.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you'll find any trouble will be their own actions,\"  He said, grinning, \"In addition, I'll take the meteoric package, buried bones included.  And I'll take it baked after a few millenia- can I bring it in the shop for a few thousand years acceleration?\"\n\n\"For a small surcharge, absolutely,\"  Mr. Engilwald sighed.\n\n\"Good.  They're going to be confused as all hell when they find out their ancestors had all the same stories.  Time to set about finishing my scripts then!\"  The boy raised a few sheets of paper, and beckoned at the door, calling in a host of other people.  A short, pudgy man with dark hair, another with bright orange hair, and a woman who looked as if the skin stretched too tight across her face.  And there were more, dozens more, each with their own costume and nationality, each from different ages of civilizations.  Each with their own purpose in the boy's mind, with lines written by the careful hand of a fourteen year old.\n\n\"What a wonderful stage this will be, when the setting's complete and my actors are deployed,\"  He said with glee, rubbing his hands together and reaching out to take the keys to the planet, the coordinates engraved on the metal, \"What wonderful pets for me to play with, as the best birthday present ever.\"",

            "comment": "Prime minister Scarblart sat in his blue office, head in tentacles, wondering what the fuck he should do. \n\nHe was the 67th prime minister of the Astron, the largest of continents on his little green ball hurtling through space, that didn't really matter right now. Astron military and economy were unmatched on the world stage but that wouldn't save anyone, it had died.\n\nThey had found it about 40 years back. A farmer had called his local police about a monster in her fields. Then as each saw it and ran it up the chain of command it soon became apparent that it was alien in nature. The world's best scientists examined the creature and the device it came with and expanded science and technology as we knew it. They also said one day it would die.\n\nThe creature itself measures 3 metres tall and 5 from snout to tail. It was orange with black stripes down its back, skin was rough scales and it's mouth was filled with razor sharp teeth. The beast had some interesting characteristics, while it might look real it was only compressed light, a hologram and it could only move writhing a 10 metre radius of the device it came with. A small metallic disk, able to be carried with 1 tentacle, with buttons along the bottom and in the middle a projector. \n\nYou used the device to care for the beast. Clean, feed, move and generally interact with it. There was even a mode to make it shoot fireballs but the device itself took an entire nuclear power plant to recharge. \n\nNow it was dead and whatever civilisation had created it would be coming for the. They had failed to keep it alive until their return. Scarblart was sure there was going to be a high price for failure. He would soon go out to a press conference and inform the public about the creatures existence and it's demise. They had failed and there was no point in hiding it anymore, the aliens would be back soon enough.\n\nThere would be panic, riots, wars, the economy would collapse and they would be lucky if they didn't nuke themselves to the stone age.\n\nHe stood and walked across to the press conference room, lackeys trailing behind. He would go down in history as the prime minister who got them into this mess but he would do it with his head held high.",

The Andomians have sent a signal again!\u201d\n\nHarris looked up from his lab, where he had been busy designing an FTL drive shaped crockery holder. \u201cWhat are they saying?\u201d He asked with excitement. \u201cDid they reply to the broadcast yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they're finally on their moon! They seem very proud.\u201d Captain Samuel Stevens told him.\n\nHarris snorted. \u201cOnly took them two hundred years after inventing heavier than air flight,\u201d he said, unimpressed. \u201cI'm giving them a millennium before FTL.\u201d\n\n\u201cOthers aren't so hopeful. Do you want to leave that on the moon for them to find?\u201d Stevens asked, pointing at the cutlery dish.\n\n\u201cNo! I've got a better idea. I developed a form of nanobot, indistinguishable from regular microbes, for them to discover there. I estimate that it'll take them fifty years to work out that they're fake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt'll do. The Galactic Ministry of Pranks is putting more pressure on us. Did you know that the crew of the Destination managed to convince an entire species that their sun was due to explode in twenty years? The exodus was a level three, or so I'm told.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmug bastards\u2026\u201d Harris remarked darkly. An idea struck him. \u201cHere's an idea\u2026\u201d he said slyly. \u201cYou remember the fake Doomsday Bomb we made for the Muvarians?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never landed, remember? The Muvarians saw straight through it, and the Galactic Empire had to gamma-scorch their world before they nuked our orbital monitor satellites. What if we deploy it for the Andomians? They're nowhere near as close to Muvarian technology. I bet we could trigger a level four exodus with that!\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed!\u201d Steven pulled up his comm device. \u201cOfficer Adams? One false Doomsday Bomb to beam down, please!\u201d\n\n\nMy first story, so please be gentle!",

They are tall and wiry and somehow far more resilient than their spindly limbs and narrow frames suggest. They eat poison and drink acid, delight in danger and chaos, and find it utterly hilarious to play elaborate practical jokes.\n\nThey made there presence known to us by broadcasting three signals at us at once. The first was easy, a simple binary replacement that, when decoded turned out to be a book. The second used the book as one piece in a three part decryption key, to reveal a set of spatial co-ordinates corisponding to a spot on our nearest moon and a timestamp. Traveling to that point at the specified time got us blueprints and codes for a machine that could translate the third signal...\n\nThe third signal which, by this point, had been being broadcast at our world for 2 whole years...\n\nIt was a looped audio recording of a long and reverberating bout of flatulence.",

Tonight, our special guests are the Z!Coreans, a species of gentle farmers on a planet orbiting Betelgeuse who have reached a medieval level of civilization. You all know what *that* means!\"\n\nAn unseen audience replied enthusiastically: \"SPACE THEIR ASSES! SPACE THEIR ASSES!\" The scene shifted to an aerial view of a Z!Corean farming village dominated by dome-shaped huts made out of blue leaves. The Z!Coreans, a four-legged species with one giant eye on their backs and a massive mouth on their underbellies, were running around in a panic at the sight of the unmanned aerial drone doing the filming. The camera zoomed in on an small Z!Corean huddling close to a larger one, presumably its parent. The small one was emitting a mixture of clicks and bleats that even a human could recognize as a cry of distress, while the parent wrapped its prehensile, multi-pronged tail - used in place of limbs - in a gesture of protection. A bubble caption popped on the screen with the words: \"Faces even a motha couldn't luv! lol\"\n\nThe host continued: \"They were so happy to see us that we just *had* to leave them a parting gift.\" The scene switched again to a nearby field, filled with blue, purple, and red vines bearing various spotted fruits. A large obelisk in the shape of a circumcised penis and covered with pictograms had been dropped in the center of the field, crushing many of the food plants. Another caption popped up reading \"Theez freeks r abt to get hard!\"\n\nA Z!Corean with a shock of orange hair around its eye - the only one with hair of any kind - crept up to the obelisk and studied the pictograms, emitting increasingly high-pitched clicks and bleats as it read. The host explained in a voice over \"We've carved our trademarked *Spac'd* dick with a message in their language proclaiming the apocalypse! Let's see what happens!\"\n\nAs the orange-haired Z!Corean's translation spread through the village, despairing bleats filled the air. One Z!Corean gouged out its eye with a farming implement, while others set to attacking one another in groups. The parent Z!Corean seen earlier stabbed its child with a lamenting bleat, then proceeded to impale itself.\n\nBefore long, the landscape was filled with dead Z!Coreans. A large space ship in the shape of male genitalia began to descend. When it landed, a lone human strode out. His face had been genetically engineered to form the classic troll face, with the only variation being his cybernetically enhanced eyes, which enabled him to see the entire spectrum of light and watch pornography at will. He planted a flag on the ground, once again featuring the image of male genitalia.\n\n\"Y'all been spaced!\" he proudly announced.",

Stank Bush, stroked his half bearded face and pondered for several seconds before answering.\n\"What do their dicks look like?\" He asked sternly.\n\"Basic cylindrical shape with a bit more bulge at the end. I anticipated a standard first contact scenario and have already plotted the orbital insertion.\" Lieutenant Becky McDonalds said briskly with a sense of pride.\nJack TimHortons, the ship's navigator, chuckled softly to himself and turned to Becky.\n\"Perhaps we should try a non standard approach.\" He said.\n\"What do you have in mind?\" Captain Chilis asked. The captain was always ready to hear out his junior officers.\n\"How about we send the new satellites? They can produce ten times the delta V, Captain. Do you have any idea how much we can make them move with that kind of propulsion capacity?!\" \nCaptain Chilis' eyes went wide.\n\"My God... Lieutenant Mcdonalds, please model an orbital insertion and account for a waving pattern. Let's say 30 degrees from the base\"\n\"Calculating now... nominal sir! The new satellites will be able to complete 74 hours of orbital maneuvers before reaching bingo fuel.\" Becky said excitedly.\n\"Good job! Input the flight plan.\" Captain Chilis said. He reached to his console to activate the internal communications system.\n\"Commander OliveGarden, prepare the new satellites for launch.\"\n\"Aye aye captain!\" Commander OliveGarden replied from the launch bay.\n\"We'll be ready to launch in 12 minutes, sir.\"\n\"Fine. Lieutenant?\"\n\"Currently modeled to launch in 9 minutes!\" Becky said hurriedly.\nThe captains eyes went wide and immediately went back to the internal communications system. \n\"Lieutenant Commander KentuckyFriedChicken, get down to the launch bay NOW and speed things up. We need to launch in 9 minutes!\"\n\"Commander OliveGarden, you have 9 minutes to launch! KentuckyFriedChicken is coming to assist.\"\n\"Aye captain, we'll get it done!\" OliveGarden responded.\n\"Mr. TimHortons, we need to buy them some time. Options?\"\n\"I'll adjust our orbit and velocity outward to intersect the launch point. McDonalds, how far before apoapsis on current path is launch?\"\n\"319 seconds!\" Becky replied immediately.\n\"Make it so, TimHortons. As usual, you're just what we need.\"\nTimHortons made the adjustments and prepared to lay in the new orbit.\n\"We will reach the launch point in 10 minutes 33 seconds after the burn... but sir, the new path will run us into the upper atmosphere.\"\nBrave Captain Chilis looked to his crew. \nFirst to Lieutenant McDonalds, rapidly working her console. To Ensign Subway at the sensor console. To Sergeant McDonalds. To Warrant Officer 5 Guys. To Ensign McDonalds, and finally to Mr. TimHortons. They all waited for the command they all already new he would give.\n\"Make it so.\" The Captain ordered. The crew returned to their duties. The Captain trusted his bridge crew and they trusted him.\nThe minutes counted down.\n\"Time until insertion?\" The captain asked\n\"60 seconds.\" Lieutenant McDonalds said.\n\"Bridge, Launch Bay. Commander Olive Garden here. We are ready to launch!\"\nThe captain slapped the console victoriously.\n\"Phenomenal work OliveGarden. Tell KentuckyFriedChicken and Private McDonalds to clear the bay and watch for an amazing show!\"\n\"Aye captain!\"\nThe captain reveled for a short time. 'My god' he thought 'we might actually pull this off.'\n\"10 seconds.\" Becky said\n\"We're about to make history.\" TimHortons said quietly.\n\nThe probes flew for the H.M.S. Stank Bush, clustered tightly together for their initial burn to place them into a stable, circular orbit. After only a few seconds, their orbital engines stopped and they began to spread apart. Their fusion generators, normally covered by thick plating, were the most important part of each tiny vessel.\nA small door opened revealing the reaction, suspended in magnetic fields. The reaction, small as it was, was so powerful that it was visible even from a great distance away.\n\nThe Chinkokos had just discovered flight. Their largest city was abuzz all day long regarding this amazing feat.\nAs nightfall came, every child and parent, brother and sister, husband and shmeklok, went to the ancestral river to rejoice.\nTheir news papers and radio commentators were speaking of the future all day. \n\"What will come?\"  \"Will we keep going higher?\" \"Are there others out there who have achieved what we have achieved?\"\nSo many questions. So few answers.\nAs they gathered and began feasting, a small child pointed to the sky and screamed aloud in fear.\nThe crowds across the city looked upwards to the sky to witness what could never be unwitnessed.\nDozens of bright lights spread out across the sky, expanding from each other... into the shape of a dick!\nAs the massive dick flew across the sky, it waved back and forth.\nSeveral lights beneath it formed the first 5 prime numbers.\nThe mathematically inclined members of the crowds shouted in amazement and bewilderment.\nThe dick flew south across the horizon as a red stretch of light moved away in a similar direction.\nThe Chinkokos no longer celebrated and began discussing the aliens above. \n\"What... what did the lights mean?\"\n\"Why did they form a dick?\"\n\"Is that how they say hi?\"\n\"Who the fuck are these guys?\"\n\nThe H.M.S. Stank Bush hit the upper atmosphere hard. Her hull began to heat up as a long, superheated trail of atmosphere was left behind her.\n\"Mr. TimHortons, what's our trajectory?\"\n\"Periapsis is 600 kilometers and dropping 10 kilometers a second. Full burn 90 degrees to horizon and we'll clear the atmosphere in 20 seconds or so.\"\n\"50 degrees. We don't want to belly flop into the atmosphere.\" The captain ordered.\nThe Stank Bush's powerful sub-light engines ignited and launched her forward, fighting against the friction. She slowly regained altitude and, steadily, velocity.\nSoon, she was out of the atmosphere.\n\"The probes... did they make it?\" The captain asked Becky McDonalds.\nThe whole crew went immediately silent.\n\"They made it!\" She said after what seemed an eternity.\n\"On screen!\"\nThe sight of the massive waving dick filled the wrap around viewscreen. The entirety of the crew tuned to their screens or found a window that happened to look in the right direction.\n\"We did it.\" TimHortons said.\n\"We did. Another successful first contact.\" Captain Chilis sat back in his chair and leaned back, breathing out as though he'd been holding his breath for hours as the crew around him launched to their feet and began cheering.\n\nFirst contacts aren't easy. They are fraught with unexpected dangers that require steely determination and ingenuity.\nFollow the adventures of the H.M.S. Stank Bush and her crew as they traverse the universe, seeking out new civilizations, and showing them what we're all about!",

A young woman had appeared standing right in front of him. She shouted hello and with a big smile explained that they had met before and were great friends. Hawking, confused, very slowly used his voice machine to ask who she was. She explained that she was Malia Obama, discoverer of time travel. Hawking, still convinced that it was a trick, explained that surely if time travel existed, we'd all know it by now. Malia smiled. She told him that she and other scientists had determined long ago that they couldn't change the past through time travel. However, they could do things that they had already done. After Steven shot her a confused look, Malia explained that she and her crew of time travelers were responsible for nearly every unexplained occurrence in human history. They had built the pyramids, made crop circles, and even placed a tiny wind machine on the moon so that everyone would be convinced the moon landing was faked. When Hawking asked why, she said that it was hilarious. Whenever they had considered abandoning the project, a time traveler had appeared from the future to reiterate how hilarious the joke was. When Hawking protested, saying he would explain the joke to the world, Malia stopped him. She told him that he would he never tell anyone. In fact, he was integral to the discovery of time travel. She dropped a stack of very complicated diagrams on his desk. He could see immediately that they were the plans to a time machine. She asked him to give them to her immediately after she had graduated. And to explain to her how hilarious it would be if she built the sphinx, but made the nose flimsy, so that it would fall off right away. And then, spread the rumor that it was all Napoleons fault. She disappeared with a whoosh. Hawking sat in silence for over 10 minutes before he finally began to chuckle.",

            "comment": "\nBill took in the mail noticing a letter addressed to him from none other than Andrew Smith. The guy he had bullied for years. He wasn\u2019t even sure how he knew where he lived this letter was going to be hilarious. He sat down eagerly opened it. \n\n\u201cMr Anderson, \n\nI am slow to anger. but I toe the line. As I reckon with the effect of your life on mine. I look back on where I failed and in every place I checked the only constant has been your disrespect. You call me a joke, with a face that needs a break. I confess my distaste with your take. I am done being kind, while this letter make confuse you it\u2019s already to late. By simply touching it you have sealed your fate\u2026.\u201d \n\nBill Anderson looked away from the letter and laughed. He always knew that Andrew Smith was a little goofy and had been an easy guy to bully his entire life still even Bill felt a little bad about ruining the guy\u2019s date last week but it was such a golden opportunity. He kept reading. \n\n\u201cYou should soon feel woozy. I know that may be a common feeling for a violent moron like yourself, but I assure you this time is a little different. I have applied a transdermal paralytic to this letter which likely has already made it impossible for you to use your legs\u2026\u201d \n\nBill thought this is ridiculous as he attempted to stand. Bill didn\u2019t move an inch from his chair. He tried hoisting himself up but couldn\u2019t even manage that. He felt panicked a little frantically he continued to read the letter. \n\n\u201cSoon that feeling will travel throughout your body and you will be unable to move at all. Eventually your lungs will also be paralyzed and you will stop breathing. I\u2019d like to say I feel sorry for you, but I don\u2019t. The only thing I am sorry for is that the lifetime of torment and fear you have inflicted on others will not be repaid to you in full. I will simply have to savor these few minutes of your well deserved misfortune. Enjoy suffocating and knowing no one will miss you. Of course I will be along shortly to remove this letter can\u2019t waste my life on yours.\n\nSincerely, Andrew Smith\u201d \n\nAs Bill\u2019s world was beginning to go dark he heard the faint sound of his creaking backdoor open the smallish frame of Andrew was semi-visible. It occurred him he probably shouldn\u2019t have bullied the chemistry genius.\n\nAlso the beginning is partial your obedient servant from Hamilton. Felt it fit the vibe well.",

            "comment": "\"Is this some kind of joke?\" You ask, barely making any effort to conceal your frustration. You know better than to go off on the first guy you stumble across in the afterlife, but this is growing remarkably tedious.\n\nThe man behind the desk doesn't even meet your gaze and seems quite irritated by the disturbance. \"I don't know what to tell you, friend. I don't read each book that comes across my desk. You have any idea how many people die a day? I just hand them out.\"\n\nYou plop back down and let out a sigh. Up until this point, the book you hold in your hands has only gone in chronological order. Many pages only end with one choice. Even the ones with multiple paths have zero impact on the \"story\".\n\n*to pursue a career as an electrician, turn to page 3,283.*\n\n*to pursue a college education, turn to page 3,283.*\n\nYou find that if you had gone to college, you merely would have dropped out in less than a semester and become an electrician anyway. Your \"choice\" amounts to nothing more than an additional paragraph at the top of the page.\n\nYou had no real say in any of it. Were all your decisions really so inconsequential?\n\nYou don't entertain the thought for long. You know what is to come. You know the moment everything fell apart.\n\nThis time you'll turn right.\n\nThe day comes. You skim through most of it, you remember the day well. You don't forget a goddamn thing on a day like that. You begin your drive home. You are lost. You're in an unfamiliar neighborhood. It is raining quite hard which obscures your vision. Your GPS on your phone is not responding. You don't remember the way back.\n\n*to turn left, turn to page 48,458.*\n\nYour heart drops in your chest. This couldn't be right. Only one choice. Only one fucking choice.\n\nYou slam the book shut. You refuse to relive that. You choose indecision. It seems to be the only other you have, and you'll be damned if this book is going to take that from you.\n\nHours pass. Days. Weeks perhaps? All the while, the man sits as his desk, reading quietly to himself. He glances up occasionally only to return to his book.\n\nYou know the rules. You must finish the book before you can leave this room. Your hands trembling, you resume where you left off. \n\n*to turn left, turn to page 48,458.*\n\nIt all happened so fast that it barely registered. All the text captures are the fuzzy details you retained. The briefest glimpse of a bicycle in your headlights. The sudden impact. The sound of a person's head very rapidly meeting pavement. A sound no amount of whiskey will ever drown out or water down. The blood. So much of it. What seems to be an impossible amount of blood.\n\nThe woman screaming. The pleas for help.\n\nThe therapy. The guilt. The anger. Bewilderment. The copious amounts of alcohol and the many fights that come along with it.\n\n*to tell your wife you understand her decision, turn to page 872,862.*\n\n*to beg her to stay, turn to page 872,862.*\n\nFor the next 500 pages or so, your choices are very limited. More often than not there is only one option. This is starting to seem like a sick joke. Eventually, there is one alternative that shows up every now and then that grabs your attention.\n\n*to try to forgive yourself, turn to page 2,567,873.*\n\nForgive yourself? You will do no such thing.\n\n*to buy another bottle, just turn the page.*\n\n*to try to forgive yourself, turn to page 2,567,873.*\n\n*to browse through that young boy's memorial page on Facebook again, just turn the page*\n\n*to try to forgive yourself, turn to page 2,567,873.*\n\n*To try slicing down the wrist this time, just turn the page*\n\n*to try to forgive yourself, turn to page 2,567,873.*\n\nYou just continue turning the page.\n\n*to pull the trigger, close this book now.*\n\nYou crumble to the floor and begin to sob uncontrollably. This is the only option you have left. The man sees his cue and walks over to scoop up the book.\n\n\"What....what was the point of all that? To torture me? Have I not done that to myself enough?\" You didn't realize you were steadily raising your shaking voice as you spoke, but the man remained unfazed.\n\nHe turns back, your book tucked under his arm. \"You've done that more than enough, my son.\" He speaks gently for the first time since you began the book.\n\nYou slowly stand on legs that barely prove to hold you, desperately hoping he will continue talking.\n\n\"You had no choices because you *made* no choice. You were only ever prepared for moments that had already passed. What you could have done differently. You couldn't choose your adventure because you were so fixated on changing it.\"\n\nYou look at the floor, unsure how to respond.\n\n\"The path you took is the path that was. Alternate endings are merely an author's fantasy.\"\n\nYou look him in the eyes and nod apprehensively.\n\n\"Are you ready to try to forgive yourself?\"\n\n\"....I can try.\"\n\nHe hands the book back to you.\n\n\"You know what to do.\"",

You could attempt to use them at any paragraph section by taking, say, 30 from the current paragraph and reading the new number that gave you. If it makes sense then the magic artifact worked and you continued. It'd generally be used for things like finding secret passages where it would be obvious you were now reading the intended section.",

There he learns that she's a scribe who helps fill out the scenarios that people have, in particular, she's working on an individual who's yet to die.\n\nHe begs her to become an apprentice so she sends him on his way to learn from the scribes. With his new found skills, he begins his work as a scribe, but unknown to others, he finds his still alive friend, and re-writes his future scenarios and a new religion is born.",

            "comment": "**Please let me know what you think!**\n\nThe book looked oddly delicate for something so big. The plain, black covers were frayed and the pages within soft and thin, tearing away from the spine in some places. It looked like a book that had been shelved, and re-shelved often, loved and read over and over again.\n\nMy name was written on the first page, not in some curlicued calligraphy, but with a plain, steady typewriter font. I couldn't help finding that oddly appropriate.\n\nI had expected some novel, some plain and staid recounting of my life. But the contents had belied the plain cover.\n\n\"You have a choice,\" I read. \"Do you choose to accept Malcolm's proposal?\"\n\nI had turned him down. In reality, I had decided to leave him behind, to forge my own career, rather than support his. What would have happened, I wondered, if I had chosen to stay?\n\nI had heard someone say that, for every choice we didn't make, there was another universe, where we did make that choice. Had some other version of me made the decision to stay? What had her life been?\n\nAlmost of their own volition, my hands turned the page. I only caught a glimpse of the words at the top of the page. \n\n*'Yes,' you cry, tears streaming down your cheeks. 'I'll marry you.'*\n\nMy fingers brushed over the words, and suddenly they were words no longer. I was standing in front of a grinning, jubilant Malcolm, as he slid the ring over my finger.\n\nA lifetime flashed through my mind, or perhaps it was only a few minutes. It was hard to tell the difference.\n\nA wedding, in some garden, laughter and joy as I walked down the aisle. Standing behind Malcolm at a rally, clapping and cheering as he talked. Even to my own eyes, I seemed young and idealistic. I lived through the birth of one child, then another, watching them grow and mature. Bittersweet tears ran down my cheeks. I could have had that. I could have had a life and children and a loving husband. I had become involved in various charities, making a real difference in real lives.\n\nAnd then, as abruptly as the barrage of images had started, they stopped, with no clear ending.\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked.\n\nThe dark figure who had brought me here, to this library said nothing. But I realised that it didn't need to answer.\n\n\"I died first,\" I said numbly. \"The other me, the one who chose to marry him, outlived me. Her story's not done yet.\"\n\nI wiped the tears away. \"Good for her. I know she'll make good choices.\"\n\nThere was a soft question, so quiet that I almost missed it. \n\n\"Do you regret not marrying him?\"\n\nI thought of my quiet life, and my cat. I thought of the occasional dates I had and the solitude of my home. I thought of my sister and her brilliant, vibrant family. I remembered my niece, and my nephews and their adoration of their slightly insane aunt. I thought of my promising career, and of dying young. My life may not have been exciting, but I had been content.\n\nAnd I thought of the other me, who had married a man she had loved and had had children who surprised and amazed her. I remembered her tiredness and frustration with her routine life. But, in the end, she had been content with her life, too.\n\nI laughed, \"No, I don't regret it. I don't regret making my choice. No life is perfect.\"\n\nA shadowy hand flipped through the pages and I saw yet another choice on the page. I settled down to read, to watch the lives I could have led and the people I could have been.\n\n/r/YarnsToTell",

I\u2019ll always keep wondering what would have been if I said no instead, but I know in the end I\u2019ll be content with my choices. You captured it eloquently.",

And that regret doesn't really serve you. \n\nBut that doesn't negate being curious about the \"what if?\"\n\nI love that your story addressed *all* of that. The protagonist was still curious (as we would all be), saw a different outcome - one that could easily have brought about that regret and chose to be above that. But still remained curious. \n\nIt feels like a realistic take on this prompt, but it's still fascinating to read. I absolutely loved it. \n\nThe reason it gave me frisson was the feeling that I (and all of us) am currently living that life right now. That my choices have consequences and alternative consequences for better or worse. And your story reminded me of that fact - but also that it doesn't matter, because the path I'm on, this life is *my* life. And it's playing out the way it's meant to be. \n\nI don't know how to describe it (I lurk this sub because I'm not a writer) - but it's really powerful, in an understated way. \n\nThank you for writing it! I hope I see you around again. :)",

This time, I was ecstatic that I had lived it and ready to go home, but also knew that I would miss the festival greatly. It was such a dualistically bitter sweet ending that made me feel warm and content. I met wonderful people, listened to incredible music, and discovered a lot about myself in a way I never could had I chosen not to go. I\u2019m not sure why this story reminded me of my own story, but I loved your writing. It was eloquently simple :)",

I feel warm, safe and soft. Is this what painkillers feel like? No wonder everyone and their grandmother is addicted to them.\n\n*Mr. Muller, you're not in the hospital, you're dead!* said the voice again, slightly amused and mocking this time. *See!*\n\n\"But ho...\" I asked while opening my eyes.\n\n*Works just like it used to, doesn't it? Haha!*\n\nAs I first open my eyes everything is bright. If I was still alive it would blind me, it catches me a little off guard. Blinking rapidly I start to make out shelves filled with books. \n\n*Welcome to the eternal library*\n\nThe voice that talked to me now has a body, a man, not white in color, not brown or yellowish either. He is very well maintained, wearing a perfectly fitting suit; his long, white hair is combed back behind his ears and falls upon his shoulders like the most vivid waterfall. Behind and next to him seemingly endless shelves of books row up; in the one he's leaning on a single book is missing, I assume it's the one he's holding in his hand.\n\nComing to my senses I find myself sitting in a very comfortable armchair. \n\n*You already noticed the book, very good, very good. Looks like you're all there. Shall we begin?*\n\n\"Wow uhm... who are you? Where exactly am I? Is this heaven?\"\n\n*Ha, I thought you'd never ask. Heaven, hell, limbo... let's just call it the library. It's the last step before you find peace. And I... I am Angelo. A pleasure to meet you, Richard Muller.*\n\n\"Angelo sounds an awful lot like Angel.\"\n\n*Don't you get nosy with me now. Come to me, take your book.*\n\nSlowly I'm starting to become aware again of my body but it doesn't feel like it did while I was alive. I'm able to move my body and feel sensations but there is no strain. The provisional groan I do when standing up proved entirely needless for there is no pain in my back, not a single sting. Two steps later I'm standing in front of Angelo, who holds the brown book towards me in just his right hand. I reach out and grab it, the leather feels soft and smooth under my hands.\n\nIn golden, beautifully imprinted letters it states \"Richard Muller - Allmantown - 791\"\n\n\"Allmantown, 791... Angelo, this means nothing to me.\"\n\n*It doesn't need to. Start reading.*\n\nThe pages were soft like silk, handwritten in redish golden color. Whenever a choice opened up, I had to decide. Turn to page 922, turn to page 508, turn to page 861. Cry for mother or sleep. Page 1810. Kiss Janie Lowenstein. Page 2941. Drink the Schnaps. Page 3229. Get into the car in the morning. Page 6276. Die. Page 6277.\n\nI have no idea for how long I've been reading and deciding. It could have been half a day, it could have been months. \n\n*Do you remember?*\n\nIt's a good question. Do I remember? I remember making the decisions, I remember the content. But do I *remember*?\n\n*Let me be more specific, do you remember how you died?*\n\n\"Of course I do, I was hit by a car.\"\n\n*And?*\n\nI'm feeling very confident in my answer at first, though after a short moment I'm unsure.\n\n\"Hold on, I wasn't hit by a car, I was in an accident.\"\n\nA tense silence.\n\n*And?*\n\n\"I fell off a ladder.\"\n\n*And?*\n\n\"I was stabbed by my wife\"\n\n*And?*\n\nThis cycle continued for what felt like an eternity. No matter how many visions of my own death I revisited, there are always more.\n\n\"Why do I see myself dying in these horrible ways?\"\n\n*I'm not torturing you, Richard.

            "comment": "I woke up on a clean white bed. I remembered last night, remember my heart stopping after a long battle, but it all felt like a dream. Where ever I was, it was a place I didn\u2019t want to leave. \n\nI got up off the bed, expecting the familiar creak of my seventy year old knees, but I instead found myself young again. Odd. As I opened the door to the small room I had awoken in, I was greeted by a library. Not just any library, but the library of me. The library of Leo. \n\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d I asked the air. \n\u201cYour life story.\u201d The air answered. \u201cI suggest you start with book 17 page 1253.\u201d\nI was trapped in the two rooms, so I figured I would follow what the voices in my head said. \n\n\nWhen I opened the book to the recommended page, my breath stopped. In it was the recorded history of the most important day of my life. The day I decided to conquer the world. \n\nI had always wondered what would have happened if I had just quit. What would have happened if I moved to the middle of no where in some random country and had opened a little shop. What would have happened if I married, had kids, had grandkids. But I had made my choice that day. I chose to conquer the world through a bloody campaign of war and genocide in the name of the American Empire; for the good of the people. In the end I lay dead with the world in ruins. \n\n\u201cTo decide not to destroy the world, go to book 57, page 106. \u201c\n\nI found the book, and opened to page 106. It was a cheery little tale. About being an artist, settling down, living happy. The problem was, it ended the same. It still ended with the me dead and the world in ruins. It couldn\u2019t be right. I grabbed another book. I became a new age hippie, traveled the world, died in a pile of rubble. Another. Local senator, ideal family, shot in the head by raiders at the end of the world. ANOTHER. I was a professor. I taught the next generation, lived content, and was murdered in an explosion. \n\nI slid to the floor, tears in my eyes. It didn\u2019t matter, it had never mattered. I was the biggest monster in human history, yet it all ended the same no matter what. If I didn\u2019t destroy the world... someone else did. Every. Time. \n\nI suppose monsters are a dime a dozen.

Gingerly, the pages flicked between my fingertips as I searched for the correct page. So many years had passed, wondering. Two marriages and two divorces, too. No children because I couldn't imagine myself having them with anyone else. My heart sank when I saw your name. I would finally know. \n\nThere was so much death. It was difficult to follow any alternative decisions because my life ended shortly thereafter. Every path, it seemed, was cursed. \n\n\"Turn to 26756.\"\n\nI glanced up, and he wasn't even looking at me. My attention turned back to the book; it was large enough to smell like a bookstore all by itself. I love that smell. A sigh escaped my lips as I realized where the text had taken place. It was the day I asked you to marry me. The last day we ever spoke. \n\nUnlike the rest of the book, this didn't have my alternative choice; I suppose I never had one. Instead, it was yours. What would have happened if you had said yes? Tears dripped off my chin. I don't think I stopped reading that book for days. The day you came out to your parents. The day we got married, both of us clad in white wedding dresses. The day I graduated with my doctorate degree. The day I found you convulsing after downing an entire bottle of pills. The day I had to admit you to the psychiatric ward for the fifth time. And the sixth, seventh, and eighth. It went on for thousands of pages; for every decision we made that kept our lives going, there were five where either you or I died. It was such a delicate life that we could have had together. \n\nI reached the final page of our potential lives together. Both of us sat cross-legged, foreheads touching, and a gun in hand, held to the temple of the other. Wherever you wanted to go, I followed. It was finally time. No alternative choices. I closed the book.\n\n\"She didn't want this life for you.\"\n\n\"It shouldn't have been her choice.\"",

The importance. All of the sadness, the fear, the excitement, anxiety, joy, love, ambition, heartache, fulfillment, failure... This was me. \n\nFingering the spine with one hand and the edges of the pages with the other, I closed my eyes, and opened to a random page. \n\nChild. Love. Graduation. Immense joy. \n\nTo another page. \n\nPride. Overcoming. Achievement. \n\nAnother. \n\nMisfortune. Selfishness. Greed. Passion. \n\nI opened my eyes. The pages wordless. All of them. I turned to the first page.\n\nEmptiness. Stillness. \n\nThis was the beginning. I understood. I thumbed a part of the page where I thought I might find her. The one beside me who never made it out. Never saw light, felt the coldness of the world. Never experienced love, grief, joy... I focused on her. I saw her. She was radiant. Beautiful. We had the same eyes. \n\nI turned ahead. \n\nThere she was. She was so pure, innocent. Even at a young age, she emanated compassion and kindness. \n\nI flipped to around the halfway mark. \n\nShe was a scientist. No, a philanthropist. No, a political activist. No... she was all of it. \n\nI turned several pages more. \n\nPeace. So much happiness. Not only within her, but wherever she went. Pure, innocent. Joy. \n\nShe was good. The world was good because of her. Not better. Good. \n\nIt was then that I knew that she was the key to bringing the world together. If only she had been born... How many others had this happened to? How better off could the world be...? \n\nI could at least help. \n\nI closed the book, laying it gently back down onto the pedestal. I looked up to the source of the light. Its warmth flooded over me. I knew that I could bask in it forever if I chose to. \n\nInstead, I gazed one last time at the book, as I backed into the shadows from where I had entered this room. \n\nThe world needs Her. \n\nAnd I was unborn, She in my place.

            "comment": "Once I had acclimatised, they led me into an office. Wood-panelled, decadent, I thought, for this place - but I supposed they moved with the times here as well.\n\n\nThere was a man at the desk dressed in a white-grey suit. Subtle. They had told me about this man, when I had calmed down. He would show me all my significant choices, walk me through them, help me come to terms with them. He would enlighten me and discourage my false beliefs about myself, to cleanse me.\n\n\nI sat. He gently placed a large, red leather-bound volume on the table. It looked like a Victorian bible, but brand new. I touched the closed leaves of the volume: The pages were going to be petal-like, delicate, just the same as bibles. This book meant something.\n\n\n\u201cAll the choices you have ever had,\u201d said the man in white. \u201cTry it.\u201d\n\n\nI reached out my hand, hesitated, and looked to him. He exuded authority. He smiled serenely. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain it all. Go on.\u201d\n\n\nI opened the book.\n\n\nThe first few chapters were uneventful, filled with childhood stories and corrections to memories I had reconstructed in my elderly mind. I remembered my mother and father here- I was smiling. No choices as yet, but I\u2019m only, what, six? Six, that\u2019s.. quite old. I looked up.\n\n\nThe man had been sitting in silence, smiling- at me, or to himself? He sensed my worry. \u201cSignificant choices, my friend. At this point, your life is controlled by your parents and you have little perception of wider choice.\u201d \n\n\nI continued. In year two of school, I was confronted with a choice. Little Jenny was being teased for her broken leg. The other children looked to me. \n\n\n\u2018Do you \n\na) join in with the children teasing Jenny\n\nor\n\nb) tease Jenny along with the children?\n\nfor a) go to page 265 or for b) go to page 265.\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\nI looked to the man across the desk. \u201cYour brain factored in being alienated by your peers against hurting Jenny. This one was a dead cert.\u201d He smiled kindly. Satisfied, if still slightly perplexed, I turned my eyes back to the book.\n\n\n\u201cJenny was always a sick girl. She hanged herself after the same kind of bullying in her thirties\u201d. \n\nMy eyes shot up, staring. The man seemed to look away, since as it to chastise himself. \u201cOf course you can\u2019t be blamed for any of this. You had no choice.\u201d\n\n\nShaken, at length I went back to reading. A pattern began to emerge. As I read further, my \u201csignificant choices\u201d became more and more frequent. To watch football with the others? To steal some cool pieces of Lego from my friend? To question the nature of my father\u2019s illness...?\n\n\nAnd each time, each option is the other, rephrased as if to give some illusion of choice. As I read further, greeted with what could only be described as amused patience from the man in white, all the pages led to the same place.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I asked, finally, battling through the dread of the answer.\n\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard of determinism? All of us, pawns, players in some shitty game. And you\u2019re here-\u201c\n\n\n\u201cHere..?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c-and it\u2019s not about responsibility, it\u2019s about balance. And now you know- this eternity? It\u2019s all gonna be electrical impulses.\u201d The man in white paused strategically. He had done this many times before.\n\n\n\u201cThey said you would help me come to terms with my choices!\u201d\n\n\nThe man in white leaned forward, smiling more explicitly now. \u201cI am. You have none. Submit. These are your terms.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...who are you?\u201d\n\n\nHe paused, and then leaned back onto his chair. \u201cThink of yourself as lucky. They live in blissful ignorance up there. Us? We know the nature of things.\u201d",

When you're twenty, a year goes by like a month. When you're 50, they seem to fly by like days. I was lucky enough to leave that concept behind before I got too far beyond 50.\n\nI had been staring at the wall for a very long time. I flexed my hand, feeling the immaterium of my projected consciousness stretch and contort, ghosts of tendons displacing veins and muscle, which only existed for as long as my attention span. It was translucent, but only because I knew what was inside. I returned my blank gaze to studying the wall. I knew what kind of Nothing was inside that too. The Room constituted Everything. The sum capacity of my new universe was 15ft by 15ft by 15ft. And the Book.\n\nI felt another well of discomfort, rising in a throat that didn't exist, anxiety flooding through my body, imaginary hormones riding blood that dried up centuries ago. Centuries? Centuries. Probably. Those things hadn't meant anything for a while. At first I had obsessively kept track of time, guessing and reguessing and estimating and correcting. That mania overtook me about twenty years in, but after a while, I realised that time only meant something when it was heading somewhere. There was only This. There was only Now. There was only the Book.\n\nAnd there was The Wall. Steven studied the wall. It was smooth, and grey, and if he concentrated hard enough, he could see the swirls in the fabric of reality, compounded and solidified into this glorious, perfect monument, exact, square, and _solid_. If he peered in, deeper, hot, white clusters pulsate, flitting around each other in a flirtatious dance, twining themselves in strands of ether, never quite touching, until, rejected, they collapse, retreat, and form a new dance. Or maybe they didn't. He reached out to touch the wall, and found that his fingers met substance. He felt the distal phalange of his index finger squish through meat, straining to make contact, to reach through the wall and join the cosmic dance. A tear that didn't exist rolled down a face that had never been seen. One was joined by others, which became None as soon as they left his face. He stroked the wall with five finger tips, and let his hand find the corner. \n\nHe hadn't moved away from the corner for a very long time. He hadn't looked at the Book for even longer. A while ago, he switched corners, but that was just because he came to know all of the white specks on that side. He predicted a year's worth of their movements, and after that he got bored. He had laughed when he first woken up with the book, and spent a year studiously ignoring it. To acknowledge it would be to give power to whatever put him here. And anyway, he was never much of a reader. But sooner or later, he had thumbed it open. Later, in this case. As his thoughts on time shifted, Later ceased to exist. The thing about eternity is, you'll do anything to fill the now, to push Later out of your mind. Later isn't something that you want to exist. \n\nThe Book was a thing of beauty. The cover was plain, and uninteresting, but it was so unassailably _real_, that it felt like it carried the sum total of everything inside. Maybe it did. Despite the number of pages, they never ran out. You flick 10,000 pages to find out where one option takes you, and still find yourself in the middle. That's part of the problem. It was entertaining for a while. Steven saw where his life led, and then the life of somebody almost like him. And then somebody slightly further away, a distant, less Steven, Steven. In fact, Steven had read, lead, visualised and been defeated, loved, lost, murdered, been killed, died of diabetes, killed himself, killed the president, _loved_ the president, a million times over. A billion. It was like an eternity of films. In fact, Steven had lived so many lives, so many Reals that were so different from his own, that Steven no longer remembered which was his own. In fact, the only concrete thing that Steven had left, was the fact that his name was Stephen. \n\nHis tears dry by themselves, eventually, and he turns his head to the center of the room, to look at the Book, drawing everything Real into it, like a black hole drawing in light. He stands, and stretches out of habit, feeling muscles sliding over rib bones, feeling lungs expand with un-air. He turns the rest of his body, and begins to place one foot in front of the other. The corner that he was sitting in, and two pieces of wall attached, slowly disperse back into the immaterium.",

            "comment": "A bookcase floated before me. I had taken a cursory glance over the first of the matching volumes to discover the old instructions of a choose your own adventure novel that I hadn't seen since elementary school. I flipped through several pages of nonsense before catching sight of something about a lemon that I recognized from an old story mom would always tell about me. It occurred to me immediately what these volumes were.\n\nSo now I've just been floating here with it. Not reading yet. Still lamenting that I did end up being doomed to spend eternity in an afterlife after all. But also trying to compile all the what ifs I had been asking myself over the years. This system was rather inconvenient. I didn't want to work my way from the beginning, I just wanted to know outcomes of certain scenarios, and I wouldn't remember the steps I took to get to those decisions in the first place.\n\nI tried to sleep on a strategy. Not sure it worked, or how much time passed while my eyes were closed, but when I opened them, there was now a computer and only one book. I glanced down at the book, lying open, and saw a recounting of a rather tender moment, but was also able to verify that I did indeed know a certain someone at that point, despite having forgotten that I had ever spoken to them not a decade later.\n\nI move over to the computer monitor and am greeted with a lovely file system organized by year. Excellent. Glad to see that the bookcase does have the capacity to shift forms.\n\nI greedily open up the folder for grade 7, am greeted with more folders, this time listing categories. Click into the romance folder, and I'm now given a series of multiple choice questions in a new window. I see all the situations are written in purple text, and the choices I had made originally were underlined in purple.\n\nI find the first question of curiosity, the first secret love letter I got. I change the response to \"keep quiet\" and notice that some scenarios vanish, with new ones in green appearing in their place. A flutter attracts my attention to the book in time to see it rest on the page in question as some of the text fades and is replaced. Excitedly I check to see if I called her out on it when she said she heard I got one. And true to my original choice, I remained quiet. No worries, I can change that choice too. I glance at the screen...and no choice exists. I flip through the book in confusion, only to discover that I was just to naive to put two and two together in the first place.\n\nLovely.\n\nI hit restore defualts and proceed to run experiments. First, each change of decision introduces new colours. This gets complicated past 10 changes trying to keep track of which shades came from which choices, but whatever. Also, the book now flips to the stage in life that will answer whatever question I had. Efficiency. \n\nTwo girls I could have dated. Both of which I was too hesitant due to my own lack of knowledge. Both of which fell into drugs in high school. I test what happens with each. One of them, we dated for a bit before she broke up with me and ended up in drugs anyway. That's a relief I guess. Other one, oh yikes, I ended up in drugs too. Wasn't expecting that to happen.\n\nTried making decisions to lead me down more creative endeavours than I had actually chosen. Mixed results. Seems I was never really satisfied there. I'd get lots of better things accompanied with worse things. Sometimes the book would noticeably shrink too.\n\nIt got even more harrowing when I started playing around with the choices during university. About half of them resulted in the book shrinking. Particularly any choice that moved towards parental dependence. I mean, I joked about that a lot after moving out, but I don't think I ever realized just how much potential for it actually existed. \n\nTried out different cities for when I left my hometown. Ultimately still ended up in the same place no matter my choice, but it was interesting how things during that intermediary period got altered. Seemed that I had picked the middle path in terms of happiness and success for my late 20s.\n\nFinally with the most what ifs out of the way, I took a breath and set out on the last of these projects, the one I was saving for last, because I knew it would take the longest. I find my way to the day my university girlfriend broke up with me. I change the response I gave just before then, check out the book...\n\n...and start working backwards.",

That's quite good, the average is 10 you know,\u201d The angel who had handed me the book said reading it's title over my shoulder. \n\n  \u201c10 what?\u201d \n\n  Its eyes were very kind and its voice was calm and soothing, \u201c10 Choices, the average person Chooses 10 times.\u201d \n\n  \u201cWhat?\u201d  I asked, and then because I could tell from the look of nearly infinite patients in it's eyes that it was going to explain the exact same thing using slightly different words, I clarified. \u201cThe average person makes thousands of choices.  Probably thousands a day.  You can choose to snooze the alarm or turn it off, then you choose to get up or go back to sleep.  You brush your hair first or your teeth.  There are several routes you could take to work or you could just drive in a random direction until you don't know anyone and no one there has ever seen you before.\u201d \n\n  \u201cThose are just reaction,\u201d the angel said.  \u201cChemicals in your brain combine, it sets off cascades through your nerves, and eventually your bodies move.  You don't Choose.\u201d \n\n  It was an argument I'd heard before, of course.  Everyone has.  We're just meat machines.  Wires and gears.  I started to make the argument that had worked in life, \u201cQuantum...\u201d \n\n  The angel cut me off it's voice filled with a well of kindness deeper than the sea. \u201cCertain quantum scale reactions aree stochastic in character.  But a coin flip isn't a Choice either.\u201d \n\n  I looked down at the book.  \u201cBut they do exist?\u201d \n\n  \u201cYou have Free Will.\u201d  For the barest instant, wrapped around the word 'you' I got the impression of  sadness in the angelic voice.

It pulls you up off the plane of reality and in that instant You Choose free of all else.\u201d \n\n  I was still looking at the book.  Perhaps 18 wasn't so bad a number after all.  I had lived an extraordinary life.  I had invented incredible things, made a vast fortune, then pumped it back into making the world a better place.  \u201cSo now I read this and learn what they were? What would have happened if I'd Chosen something else?\u201d \n\n  \u201cYes.\u201d \n\n  \u201cAnd then?\u201d \n\n  The angel smiled, a warm golden expression, \u201cAnd then you learn more about Choosing and how to do it more often.\u201d ",

            "comment": "I sat at the desk dumb-founded. \n\n\u201cYou mean... you mean this is everything that could have happened if I just made a different decisions?\u201d\n\nThe spirit in front of me is a friendly face but the marks on her neck tell a story of sadness. She looks at me as if I\u2019m the first she says this to. \u201cYes. From the day you were born to the day you died. Every decision and every outcome. Although trust me when I say that anything before the age of 10 is more just whining and boredom. You may have done something crucial back then that caused a different outcome but it\u2019s highly unlikely. Anyways. The book is yours. Feel free to read and digest it. But just know, you can\u2019t change anything. Everything that happened is set. You can only see what could have happened.\u201d She gave me a look that may have been a look to scare me but really I just wanted to get out of there. \n\nI picked up the book and walked out of the office. As soon as the door behind me closed, I let out an unneeded breath. I looked down at the book in my hands. \n\nEvery decision. \n\nThere was one passage I just had to read. One passage I thought was the reason for all the karma and the outcomes I made. The one reason I died. \nI was in a car accident. A severe car accident where We ran off the side of a cliff and into the ocean. As far as I\u2019m aware, there were no survivors of the accident but I didn\u2019t see anyone else. \n\nIt was just me.  \n\nI looked around. It seemed like I hadn\u2019t left Earth. I was still on the green and blue planet. But I knew that wasn\u2019t true. \n\nWhen you die, you become a spirit and go to a place that is similar to where you left. So I was in California, on a cliff, overlooking the ocean. \nI sat at the edge and opened the book to the date I knew it all started. The date I knew I had meet my match to death. I took another  unnecessary breath and opened to July 18th, 2010. The day I meet Parker. The day I opened myself up to pain and abuse and neglect. The day I opened myself to telling myself that it wasn\u2019t him. The day I started to leave my family behind. \n\nOn the page it has Parker\u2019s name and the place we meet. The skate park. I couldn\u2019t skate but I would go with my best friend, Amanda, and we would check the guys out. I remember the day so clear. I introduced myself \u201cAva.\u201d And he told me his name \u201cParker.\u201d I remember being taken in by his sharp green eyes and the dyed jet black hair. The way his pants hung loose on his hips. I was a senior in high school and craved attention from any male I could get. \nWe had talked and talked and soon became more than just friends. When I graduated, we left the small town we lived in Colorado and moved to California. \n\nIt was a mistake. \n\nWe couldn\u2019t find a job or a place to live that we could stay in longer than 6 months. Drugs became an obsession for Parker while I stayed away and just waitress. It was long hours and strained our relationship but one of us had to work. \n\nThe drugs became more of a problem and when I refused to give him money for them anymore, he hit me and told me to obey. That\u2019s when I thought I wasn\u2019t going to be able to leave. I had planned on leaving after I had saved enough money. I knew my sister would let me stay with her, I just had to get to her myself. I had been stashing money and lied to Parker that I didn\u2019t have anything for him. \nHe found it. \n\nMy sister came once to save me but I was too weak under Parker\u2019s control. I told her that I was fine. \n\n\u201cAva. Your arms are bruised and you have lost weight. Not to mention the look of this place. You need to come home. We\u2019re worried.\u201d \n\n\u201cWorried? Where were you when I turned 18 and moved out here? You didn\u2019t seem to care then. Why care now?\u201d And the door slammed in her face. \nI have never felt more guilt. \n\nThen just a few months later, comes the day I die. I finally made the decision that I couldn\u2019t do this. We were driving up the coast just to get some fresh air. I looked over at Parker and felt fear not love and that\u2019s not what I wanted. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d I had blurted. \n\nParker looked over at me, stunned \u201cWhat did you just say to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore. I missed my sisters wedding. I missed the birth of my nephew. My mom is sick. I just want to go home. You and I are not compatible. We  ever were. We lived in a fantasy and hoped it would work but we need to face reality. We\u2019re broke. You do drugs. I can\u2019t work 7 jobs to make ends meet. It\u2019s time to let this die.\u201d\n\nAt that, Parker had agreed but not to let me go. To let us die. He jerked the wheel and went over the cliff. I remember screaming and slamming on the door to get it to open but the pressure of the water was too much and I couldn\u2019t get out. \n\nSoon water started to enter the car. Parker just laughed and said we deserved to be together for eternity. I think he died laughing. \n\nI looked down at the page. Page number 37. The options were (approach Parker, pages 37-150) or (stay with Amanda, pages 150-350). \n\nI turned to page 150. \n \nEdit: so sorry about the formatting!  I did it on my phone but it should be all fixed now. ",

Save for the dimly lit area around me there was only an unrelenting void. There was no distinguishable source for the light and the only other defining characteristics of my 10x10 foot purgatory was the enormous book and a simple wooden chair adorned with a single teal cushion.\n\nThe cold embrace of the surrounding abyss offered no explanation as to my situation so I turned my attention to the book. *Your life* read the title. I fliped open to the first page, leaving the cover dangling helplessly over its own mass. There I find a detailed account of my own birth. The following several pages offer nothing more; they all simply describe the mundane life of a not-yet-conscious infant.\n\nI flipped mindlessly ahead until I reached a header that said \"first memory\" that proceeds to describe my first conscious moments involving my mother dressing me in coveralls along with... A prompt?\n\n*To cry, turn to page thirty seven thousand. To make a pathetic attempt as expressing happiness, turn to page four hundred thousand three hundred and seventy six*\n\nThis made no sense. I traversed my way as quickly as I could to the end of the book. The binding of the book made a sizeable arch as the pages flipped madly. On the second to last page I read\n\n*You die in your sleep, old and alone. You immediately find yourself in a void with nothing but a large book and a chair. To explore the unknown, flip back three pages. To seek information from the book before you, return to page ninety six*\n\nMy skin feels clammy at the stress of my returning memories. The shock of death must have stopped me from understanding immediately that I was dead. I expct my heart to be racing yet I am met only with the cold nothingness of a heart-stood-still. Surprisingly though my skin has narry a wrinkle on it. There is nowhere for me to see a reflection, but this is definitely not the body I had previously. It seemed I was restored to a younger state to experience whatever damnation had befallen me.\n\nI considered the strange choose-your own adventure book of what has been snd what could have been before gazing back into the deep nothingness that surrounds me. Its shrouded haze made me feel like a small fish swimming in the vast expanse of infinity. I know nothing of the existence I find myself in other than what I remember from a life now gone. I was always a fan of reading. I decided to try and find the page where I went to high school prom. I wonder what would have happened if I kissed that young lady instead of being overpowered by fear?\n\nYes, that sounds nice. What else is there to do but relive the mundane? After all, even the banal seems pleasant when the infinite expanse of darkness is my alternative.\n\n\n\nEdit: feedback is appreciated.\n\n",

I had had a few drinks that night and though technically sober, I always felt like it was my fault or wondered what I could have done better..  In my grief, i left the home we built together and all friends we had made over the years would write and call occasionally, but would always want to start talking about how I had to buck up or move on.  \n\nI had tried to date, even had a few great dogs to keep me company over the years but it was never the same.  I decided to get over my fears by helping others.  I joined AA, I helped build parks and named the playgrounds after my children.  I even named a bench for my wife and ate there every Sunday for nearly 30 years.\n\nWhen I finally died and went to heaven, I was given a book. It was strange though.  I got to read about the lives of all the decisions s that never happened because of that one day.  I got to see pictures of my children going to prom.  I got to see my wife get old.  I couldn\u2019t believe it but I was supposed to have twins!  St Peter looked at me and asked me a single question.  \u201cWould you do things differently now that you know what you lost\u201d?  I heard later other people waited decades before answering, but I knew my answer immediately.  \u201cNo. I have made mistakes, many of them in my lifetime.  However, if this is heaven, my wife and kids are here and already know that I never stopped loving them and went on with my life helping others each day while thinking of them\u201d.\n\nSt Peter smiled and said \u201cwelcome back to your family\u201d.",

Every good decision, every bad decision, every good moment, every bad.\"\n\nThe paper had under \"actions\" my date of birth, the words \"the calling,\" and the date of my death. Under \"outcome\" it simply stated, \"unchanged.\"\n\nI sighed. Having amounted to quite literally nothing in life it was no surprise that even in the afterlife I would have to be reminded of what a failure my life was.\n\n\"Ah, yeah, that, I am a failure of epic proportions that much is true,\" I admitted, handing the paper back.\n\nThe angel looked shaken by such an outrage. Holding the paper up he stated, quite simply, \"There are few mortal men who are divine saints without knowing it. You spent literal decades without affecting anyone. A saint in a monastery with a completely celebrate pledge doesn't put so much effort into such a display of purity.\"\n\n\"So what now?\" I asked, trying not to cringe about the obvious implications of my \"purity.\"\n\n\"You will of course join the rest of the purest saints in state as we wait for Armageddon.

Jesus Christ, there's a lot of death in here. It's a miracle I lived as long as I did.\n\nFlipping through page after page, I remember the ridiculous things I used to do, with my friends, with Jake, on my own, everything.

Select \"let Jake crash on the couch.\" Play.\n\nIt turns out Jake turns into a real asshole sometime in the late 2000s and even in what would be now, nobody in my family barely speaks to him. I don't care, I get to see him grow old.\n\nIt's like when I first discovered Wikipedia, walking down all these what-ifs and different timelines and seeing how they bounce off of one another. February 18, 1985. \"Choose Mom.\" Play. Jake's less of an asshole there, somehow, and apparently I never stopped talking to that Jake. October 31, 1988. \"Let Jake be Batman.\" Play. Doesn't change much, but it's great watching him run around and exasperate either parent in the timelines. August 12, 2002. \"Accept job in Alaska.\" Play. Long-distance calls makes keeping in touch with family difficult, but we ICQ from time to time. He's still alive there. It's Asshole Jake, but he's still there. I die earlier, though.\n\nOctober 15th, 2019. \"Don't drink.\" Play.\n\n...well, I continue living, I guess.

It's cover was dusty, as if waiting for me. I knew as soon as I opened it that time would stand still. God told me that. God told me everything that wasn't in this book. I could have been a painter, a truly great painter like Rembrandt. The book had all these illustrations I drew, every single one. From doodles on napkins to a mural I could have painted in a Roman cathedral. My real life, the one that ended much sooner than this chapter was a good read. I saw all my decisions at once. I always seemed to take the destructive path, the immoral path. I knew what I had achieved in life, but to see it all on paper is something else. A long list of every life I had touched, had maimed, had been in the presence of. The book had no end, there was an infinite number of pages. More of them dedicated to my possibilities of being a world class artist. By comparison, my real life was miniscule and short. \n\n\"Do you regret any choices you've made?\" asked God. \n\n\"No.\" I lied. \"Well, maybe the suicide.\" \n\n\"Of course\" said God, \"we all regret our death. If we had just one more day, we could rule the world.\"\n\n\"I did rule the world, once.\" I said.\n\n\"Once.\" God led me up from the chair and down a set of stairs. A long and winding staircase. The heat was unbearable by the time I got to the last step. \n\n\"Adolf, my son, this is your room.\" said God. ",

When I was still young and was playing terrible make believe games with my brothers and sisters. The multitude of choices here never amounted to anything significant. \n\n*Decided to agree with sisters; Page 539*\n\n*Decided to agree with brothers; Page 540* \n\nNo real differences that amounted to anything bigger. \n\nThat was fine. I was actually sort of relieved at that, relieved to know that those choices could never really affect what happened later on. \n\n\"You're stalling,\" He said. The tone wasn't accusatory nor was it complacent. It just sort of was. Pissed me off a bit actually. \n\n\"Yeah, I am,\" I scoffed turning to him. \"These were the better days. Can't I enjoy them?\" \n\n\"You can't leave unless the book is done. Those are the rules,\" He answered. Again, you couldn't get anything out of his voice. It just sort of was. \n\n\"Is there a problem if I don't go?\" \n\n\"No. The schedule can be changed.\" \n\n\"Than let me read at my own pace, okay?\" I called as I turned to the book again. \"'Sides, I'm not going to read all of it.\" \n\nI wasn't lying. One of my many faults. I wasn't going to waste my time reading every single one of the outcomes that could have occurred if I had chosen a different path.

I thought that maybe there would have been a choice that didn't have me fighting. Guess that wasn't in my path. \n\nI turned to the end of the fight, knowing that if this wasn't origin point of what I become, than the end of the fight would have been. \n\nLo' and Behold I was right. \n\n*Go back to drinking; Page 12,677*\n\n*Scare his mates; Page 12,788*\n\n*Glass his mates; Page 12,877*\n\n*Finish the fight; Page 12, 554* \n\nThat was it. The point where my life started. I flipped forward a bunch of pages to see what my choice where at another point. I actually laughed out loud when I saw that there were only three options.\n\n*Join; Page 23,111*\n\n*Ignore; Page 23,311*\n\n*Rat them out; Page 24,555* \n\n\"Zeus be damned, I was set up from the start,\" I said as I continued to read down the path I had taken. \n\n*Burn the church; Page 25,666*\n\n*Burn the Government Building; Page 25,776*                   \n*Execute the Bishop; Page 25,987*                \n*Let the crowds handle him: Page 26,001*                  \n*Throw the Molotov Cocktail; Page 27,244*\n*Use the flamethrower; Page 27,300*              \n*Hang the Arch-Bishop; Page 34,101* *Behead the Arch-Bishop; Page 34,180* *Fire the first shot; Page 35,188* *Call in for a Volley Fire; Page 35,201* *Blow up the Parliament Building; Page 36,333* *Storm the Parliament Building; Page 36, 389* \n\nI continued to read down the path I had chosen, only occasionally glancing at the other possible outcomes of the action I could've taken. My smile never faded as I continued to read down the list of the methods of torture, the people killed, the lives thrown into chaos, the bodies that drowned in the wake of the choices I made. \n\nWhen I was satisfied with what I read, I loudly slammed the book. Just I was began to reach into my pocket, he called over, \" Ready to go on?\" \n\n\"Give me a sec,\" I said, as I pulled out my trusty friend. Without a second thought, I flick it up and let the flames lick at the edges of the book. It was only a couple more second before the book I was holding in my hands had caught fire and was burning with a strangely calming orange flame. After I felt satisfied with the results of my actions, I walked over the him, throwing the book over my shoulder. \n\n\"It will not be destroyed.\" \n\n\"Figured as much. The place seemed to Holy and shit,\" I answered with a smile. \"So, did I get to pick the ride or it just an instantaneous thing. I always figure that singing 'Highway to Hell' while headin' to hell would always be funny as hell.\" \n\n\"You don't have any qualms about your actions?\" The only time I could tell there was an emotion or a hint of something human. \n\n\"No. I was broken from the start. Besides, I'm pretty sure that if I hadn't chosen the revolution, I would have been a lot less justified in my doings. Maybe some good came out of my actions. Maybe some didn't. I don't really care. I know where I was headed the second, I start on my path. I just hope you guys do your worst.\"",

But on the second to last day the couple she was staying with hosted a dinner for the 5 of us who came to do construction work.

Its a book about the decisions you made and what the outcomes could\u2019ve been\u201d said the angel.\n\n\u201cWell yes, but why?  Why would I want to read about the possible outcomes now that I am deceased?\u201d\n\nThe angle sighed, as if they were annoyed by my inquiry.  \u201cSome people like to see where they could have been and if a different decision was made, how their life could have been.\u201d\n\nI paused for a moment, still holding the book in my hand.  The leather quality was nice.  I quickly paged through it, noting that varying in age of the ink as someone had written each section after each possible decision.  The ink in the back pages still seemingly fresh and not aged.  If the angels were writing these by hand, I felt bad for those that had to write this stuff out for people with severe ADD.\n\nMy questions continued.  \u201cBut why?  The decisions I made through my life were not ones I can or could change.  Why would I want to see what I *could* have done when I am here now.  Isn\u2019t that what matters?\u201d\n\nThe angel changed from annoyed to curious.   \u201cAre you saying you wouldn\u2019t change any of the decisions you made?  Aren\u2019t you curious about that the one girl you never asked out, or the day you took that phone call?\u201d\n\nOf course I was always curious.  Those simply decisions would crop up in dreams or when I saw someone more successful than I.  The decisions I made and how maybe I could have done better.\n\n\u201cWell, sure.  But the outcome could only be relief if I had done worse or heartache if I could had done better.  Certainly I had regrets about things I didn\u2019t get to do or opportunities I missed out on but they are only mild regrets.  The things I did do gave me meaning and fulfillment in their own way.\u201d  \n\nThe angels curiosity continued.  \u201cYou say had\u2026 meaning you don\u2019t have them anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I have them now?  If I am deceased, there is nothing from my living life that came with me other than my memories so why would that matter here?  I tried to live a positive life and do the right things when possible.  Why would I worry about that life now?\u201d\n\nThe look on the angles face shifted to a mild sense of superiority.  \u201cWhat if I told you it *did* matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then we are back to my original point:  the decisions have been made and I can\u2019t go back to change them.  If I am going to be punished for any one of the decisions, why would I want to dwell on them?  If I were to be rewarded, then so be it.\u201d\n\nThe angel was quiet for some time as if they were conferring with someone telepathically or simply being decisive about lunch, it was unclear.\n\nI pressed on.  \u201cSo if I am choosing not to read this, what\u2019s next?\u201d  \n\nThe angel disregarded my question.  \u201cWhat if I told you this is your only chance to read this?  You will never get a chance to learn this information again.\u201d\n\nI chuckled in anxious amusement.  \u201cWhy are *you* so adamant that I read it?  Is there something you aren\u2019t telling me about why I should?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone.  My purpose is provide you with the book.  Just like your mortal life, the decision is your own.  I will say however that your decision not read it follows quite clearly with your choices for meaning rather than self indulgence.\u201d  \n\nI paused at the angels words.  Was this a compliment or an insult?  I handed the book back to them.\n\nThe angel nodded and took the book from my hands.  They continued.  \u201cEven those that find that kind of wisdom later in life still tend to want to read it.  Usually out of indulgence.  The wisest however recognize that reading the decisions themselves are more knowledge despite the fact there is nothing that can be done.\u201d\n\nThe angel gently held the book up towards me as one last gesture of opportunity.  I smiled and pushed their hand away.  \u201cIt sounds like I still have quite a bit to learn then.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well\u201d said the angel. \u201cI must ask though, aren\u2019t you curious about the decision that ultimately led you here?\u201d\n\nI let out a huge laugh as if someone had told funniest joke in the world.  \u201cNope.  I knew that decision would come back to get me one day.\u201d\n\nThe angle smirked, trying to contain their own sense of laughter.  \u201cVery well.  Follow me.\u201d\n",

Then I notice something I'd overlooked before. \n\nI fall to my knees in disbelief as Gabriel starts pulling spaghetti out of his pockets and pressing it into my hair. \n\n\"It's... a 4-leaf clover.\" ",

Everything you could ever hope to dream of has been achieved, and more. You have no regrets. As you drift off to sleep, you see a light and a heavenly being comes down to take you to a reward that not even one as accomplished as you could possibly deserve. This is a new beginning, but for this life this is ....\n\n&gt; the end.\n\nNow THAT is more like it. You flip ahead. You see numerous possible endings but all of them pale in comparison. You keep turning the pages but the more you read the longer the book seems to be. You never find a page that will lead you to the promised ultimate ending. Time passes.\n\nYou feel like you have taken too long.\n\nYou do see a light, and a strange shape in the middle. A voice you do not yet understand speaks out \"it's OK, we won't need the theater, it's almost out\".\n\nYou wail.\n\nYou are placed on a familiar yet unfamiliar place. To crawl ahead, go to 3.

I knew nothing about that place and all of a sudden I was handed a book without any instructions, voices. Was this a trap or a kind of a final test? Or a second chance? Or will I be in a loop of this - whatever it is. I thought for a while. What if I change the decision I made in the past? There will be more challenges if I decide to make any changes from my past. Whatever happened, has happened. I closed the book and put it in the ground. I already made my decisions to end up here. I had a happy life. \n\nThen I remembered the ones that I loved the most. No one here, nothing but a blank. I could not move. I only saw my body.\n\nSuddenly I came up with an idea. An idea that needs more courage than to turn the pages. Yes I felt I could do it. I would live the same life once again. There were no rules instructed about using the book but I felt like my actions ends the way I think. I turned the first page. There it is, \"my first decision\". I chose what I chose in the past. \n\nNothing happened! Nothing at all. I felt like, I spent weeks in this place where there is no felling of a time. I had no choice but to start reading the book, choosing and see the outcomes.\n\nSo I did...As soon as I finished reading chains of decisions, I saw another copy of myself in the end of the book...",

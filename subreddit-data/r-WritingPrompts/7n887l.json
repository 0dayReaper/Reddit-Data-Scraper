            "comment": "It was dusk and Tornnus, son of the fire, was hammering the searing steel into a knife. He needed it urgently as the night before he had lost his somewhere between countless beers, ales and songs. His sturdy, soot-covered hands were trembling due to the abstinence and he couldn't quite spot when was the last time he had been sober at this time of the day.\n\nBut he knew very well that the knife was a matter of life and death.\n\nHe didn't dare to look downwards where his long, braided and ginger beard rested. He felt heretic and dirty inside. He could feel those rioting hairs pricking against his chest, dishonoring their ancient culture. A culture which condemned those whose beards weren't immaculate. \n\nHe had to cut them off. Otherwise, he couldn't leave his forge which meant no alcohol, which meant betraying his kind.\n\nThe night fell and the tender red of his forge and crucible tinged his gloom smithy. Tornnus sat on a chair which creaked for his life, fidgeting as he gazed, unblinking, towards his iron table where the boiling knife rested. He cursed under his breath, for he had forgotten to fill his slack tub with cold water.\n\nHours had passed and the knife remained the same, strange thoughts wandered across Tornnus' mind. Could he risk ruining his beard using the knife as it was? The answer was a resounding negative. He felt caged and claustrophobic, his bloated skin was dry begging for the holy ichor to feed his veins. What could he possibly do?\n\nA not so deranged idea crossed his mind, removing the insurgent hairs with his bare hands. But it faded into forgetfulness once his eyes met the mess of grease and soot that he called hands. Tornnus took a deep breath and stared downwards to properly assess the chaos. \n\nHe fainted after witnessing stains of soot impregnated on his beard, dulling its usual brightness and hiding its fiery red. If only he had remembered to fill some buckets with water, this would have never happened.\n\nHis black eyes shot open at the booming noise of fists stomping his oak door. Daylight seeped through the crevasses of his dry stone walls. How long did he lay unconscious? His lips were shattered, his beard disturbed by various dirty enemies yet Tornnus wasn't worried about that anymore.\n\n\"I'm sleeping you bastards! I will open in two hours,\" he yelled and the noise stopped.\n\nTornnus examined the knife, strangely he remembered everything that had happened the day before. Was he enchanted? What was this witchcraft? He almost bolted out the room to seek for Muradain's blessing, he needed answers, his brain felt overwhelmed yet relaxed by the memories. He had never felt so good in his life.\n\nTornnus was torn between two conjectures. If a dwarf stains his beard, then he's granted the power of memory by other forcers, was the first one. The other one was simply that Alcohol was a mind wiper in disguise. He felt a shiver crawling up his legs, both of these ideas defied his beliefs.\n\nBut he was going to test them.\n\nHe waited for the dusk\u2e3awhen all the dwarves went to the inns or stayed at their homes drinking beer\u2e3ato fall and left his smithy to seek some water. The dwarves that still roamed the streets cursed at him, some even defied him to a duel for his honor but Tornnus ignored them all. He simply filled some buckets with water and brought them back to his smithy, where he cut, cleaned and perfected his beard.\n\nThe next morning, he remembered everything with unbelievable clarity. His beard was immaculate, so it had to be the alcohol. With his chest high he sought for those who defied and cursed at him the night before. He found them smiling and claiming that they didn't remember doing such a thing.\n\nTornnus' discovery could've changed the beliefs of his people but, like a proper dwarf, he said nothing and went to get some beer and ale.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n/r/therobertfall            \n",

They both deal with resource management as a core mechanic but df would be like if you add dozens of players to factorio and say \"get x done\" then add in things like individual sanity, health, happiness, jobs, and a lot of dying. Df is more about managing all aspects of a fortress. Different kind of exploration too in df as you pretty much stay in one spot and explore downwards instead of roaming around.\n\nTL:DR if you like Factorio, you'll probably enjoy Dwarf Fortress to some degree and it's free to play anyways so why not?",

For instance, the maps are of similar dimensions, except in DF they're multi-layered - you could dig down a hundred levels, finding new materials to exploit, underground rivers and lakes, magma tubes, bottomless chasms and pits, entire layers of interconnected caverns with their own biomes.  You can build towering castles and deeply-buried bunkers, high-rise apartment blocks and execution pits.\n\nRW has the odd little pond or stream that's mostly just an obstacle on the map - DF has flowing water and lava you can interact with - flood part of the world to make an artificial lake or build a moat.  Plumb it under your base to provide a watersource for your well.  Make a trap room that drowns or incinerates your enemies.  Accidentally flood your base because you forgot water pressure was a thing.\n\nRW has relationships and marriages.  DF has *children*.  Your founders will pair off and have babies, you'll see them grow up to become productive members of society... or not.\n\nRW has some traps and automated turrets.  DF has a fully-blown mechanics system from which you can build anything from a drawbridge to a computer.  Make a room flood itself when someone walks into it, and a lever to drain it, connect up a field of spike traps to a timer mechanism and a lever and impale your enemies on command.\n\nRW has a pretty looking planet with randomly distributed settlements dotted around it.  DF has a world with hundreds of years of simulated history where civilisations and religions rise and fall.  You might find the dwarven civilisation [led by a goblin king](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=107018.0), or infected with vampirism.\n\nRW is a colony builder.  DF is also an open-world roguelike.  You can join the world as an individual, go find that dwarven goblin king, and try to kill him, in ways every bit as gruesome as you will find in RimWorld.\n\nI could keep going - from the simulated weather to the detailed military system, the extensive production lines you can set up, the [procedural poetry](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/03/19/dwarf-fortress-poetry-generation-matters/), the randomised creatures, the demanding nobles, the 3D trees that actually drop fruit and shed leaves with the seasons, the massive range of biomes and the various modifying attributes they can have, the sheer detail the landscapes have, how the underground isn't just completely random but actually based on fairly sensible geological layers that differ from place to place.  But you probably get the point.\n\nIt's more approachable than it looks.  The menus are a bit silly - you might get annoyed that some have you scrolling through them with one key when another menu uses a different key, but it always tells you what keys do what.  Mouse support is limited.  The ASCII won't be to everyone's taste but you can have it use a wide range of tilesets.  There are even mods to [make the world isometric](https://dfhack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins/stonesense/docs/Stonesense.html?highlight=stonesense).\n\nLearning all the ins and outs will take a while, but you can take it up piecemeal at your own pace and ignore large chunks if they don't seem interesting.  So long as you can grow food and set up the basics, it's up to you how deep you want to go.  You can even turn off invaders if you just want a quiet colony simulator until you're ready for more challenge.\n\nGrab a copy of the [newb pack](http://lazynewbpack.com/) and have a run through a [walkthrough](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and see how you get on.  All it'll cost is some time.  Maybe a lot of time.",

He hefted the gate with all his might; the gate to the surface was not meant to be opened and closed very often and resisted his efforts to leave the mountain. He blinked in the sunlight and wondered how his son could tolerate the surface.\n\nThe last time Papa BlackPorter had seen his son DeepStone, the young dwarf had set up a tent just outside the gate. The tent was gone. Papa BlackPorter spun slowly and examined his blurry surroundings. Dwarven eyes can focus finely on objects up-close, but rarely have reason to focus on objects in the distance; he really had to strain his vision to sight a tall, tall, tall stone tower a mile up the mountain.\n\nHe hiked to it and ran his hands over the tower's walls. The workmanship of the masonry was as good as DeepStone's fingerprint to the experienced Papa BlackPorter. \"Come out, son, I know yer in there! It's not right, leavin' the mountain and buildin' towers! It's not the dwarven way!\"\n\nWhen he heard no answer, Papa BlackPorter circled the tower looking for an entrance. He found none; DeepStone had built the tower around himself from the inside. Papa BlackPorter took his trusty pickaxe from his belt and tunneled through the tower wall. \n\nInside the tower there was a staircase. Papa BlackPorter sighed as he climbed. Dwarves should never be so near the sky!\n\nAt the tower's ceiling there was a wooden hatch. Papa BlackPorter opened it and saw his son DeepStone sitting on the tower's ceiling's center. \"Come down, son, yer gonna get sky-poisoning up here!\"\n\nDeepStone was unnaturally tanned by the sun. He wore black goggles to protect his eyes from alchemy ingredients arranged before him. He watched a Bunsen burner boil brown sludge in a glass flask as he powdered pebbles with a pestle. \n\nPapa BlackPorter approached with a canteen of emergency alcohol. \"Son, how long has it been since yer last drink?\"\n\n\"I drink pure water, now, father. I pull it from the air.\" \n\n\"I mean a stiff drink, lad.\"\n\n\"Not since I left the underground.\"\n\nPapa BlackPorter opened the canteen and put it under his son's beard. The canteen's contents were strong enough to made DeepStone's mustache curl. \"Drink, son. Please.\"\n\n\"Do you wonder why there aren't any dwarven wizards?\" asked DeepStone. His father had no answer. \"It's because we don't apply ourselves.\"\n\n\"Yer not talkin' right.\"\n\n\"Father, look.\"\n\nDeepStone put down his pestle and donned a thick glove. With the glove, he turned off the Bunsen burner and tilted the glass flask of boiled brown sludge. He poured the sludge through a screen. \n\nOn the screen remained flecks of blue metal. Papa BlackPorter covered his mouth. \"Is that---\"\n\n\"Mythril,\" said DeepStone. \"Material of Elven Magicians.\"\n\n\"Did you---\" Papa BlackPorter squinted at the blue flecks. \"Did you make this with magic?\"\n\n\"Dwarven magic. Alchemy. It's not flashy stage-show magic, but I figure it oughta take the Elves down a peg or two.\"\n\n\"Aw, that's my boy!\" Papa BlackPorter hugged his son close. \"I can't claim to understand ye, but I approve of yer alternative lifestyle!\" ",

            "comment": "Urist was startled awake by the sounds of screams from outside his room, mercifully dampened by distance and the heavy wooden door that lead into the living quarters passageway.  He grimaced anyway, somehow aware he was on the verge of a splitting headache that would make itself known at the slightest provocation.\n\nThe booze had ran out yesterday, and already the fort was in disarray.  The usual sounds of the fort were deafeningly absent - the throng of metalworking, the chipping of the stonecarver, thwacking of the butcher, the constant hum of conversation and song - all replaced with moaning, crying, and the occasional pained or angered scream.\n\nHe decided his best course of action was to stay in bed.  Outside it he never quite lost the sense of chill this place had - knowing he was only a dozen blocks away from the largest ice sheet he had ever seen somehow dampened the heat of any fire and the comfort of his furred clothes - but here in his warm bed, in the stupor of sleepiness, he clung to the only real sense of true warmth he could remember since he arrived here.\n\n\"*An exotic home under the ice*\" they said.  \"*A chance at a fresh start*\" they said.  \"*You'll find riches in the untouched Earth*\" they said.\n\nInstead all they found was granite, basalt, and a few meagre streaks of coal and hematite, under more ice than he thought existed in the world.  Where were the magma tubes the geologists promised to help turn their cold little hole in the ground into a cosy home?  Where was the underground lake they were so sure must be under such a thick layer of ice?  How could there not be a living underworld here, caves of edible creatures and plants that they believed underlaid the whole world?  They seemed to stretch on forever in the depths under his old mountainhome, but here in this Armokforsaken place they'd found nothing but ice and an endless sea of rock.\n\nUrist wasn't used to such thoughts.  He was used to just getting on with things, the realities of his harsh life fading away into the usual fuzz of routine.  Whenever he felt the cold fist of reality closing in there was always a barrel of dwarven ale or river spirits from the supplies to ease his mind.  How bad could it be, really, with a belly full of ale?\n\nThere was shouting now.  Accusing sounds, angry.  Then, louder, the distinctive voice of Mayor Amkin.  It was getting closer.  Urist could pick out some of the words now, a rambling tirade about how none of this was his fault emerging from the cacophony.\n\nHis head started to throb.  The ache in his gut grew.  Dwarves weren't meant to feel this way, to worry about their lot in life, to bicker and fight when they could be working towards their future, to feel the sheer existential dread of knowing they were trapped in a harsh world full of horrors both mundane and miraculous.\n\nThey were just meant to drink and *get on with it*.\n\nThe shouting reached a crescendo, and was suddenly replaced by a blood-curdling, gargling scream.  Then abrupt, unnatural silence.\n\nUrist held his breath and pulled the covers closer.  It's warm here, he thought.  At least it was warm.",

I like it!\n\nThe meter was a bit uneven a few times here and there (\"So for the first time, a dwarf did wax\" had too many syllables, for example), but all in all you told a good story full of humor and keeping with the theme of the prompt. Try reading each line out loud as you write to see if you can change around the emphasis on certain words or reword something to make it fit better. Other than that, your rhymes were great and the familiar AABCCB rhyme scheme felt like it contributed to the humor.\n\nA word of advice in regards to the punctuation: Commas at the end of each line are optional in this kind of poetry, as the line breaks imply pauses especially in a meter like this. You can certainly keep the commas as a stylistic choice, of course, but I personally felt that they worked naturally in some lines and didn't quite fit in others.\n\nYour poetry is improving, Nick! It's always a pleasant surprise to see you part from your usual prose, and it's fascinating to me as a reviewer/critic to watch you steadily get better as a poet. We'll yet make a proper bard of you, lad!",

            "comment": "Dwarves drink. It's what they do, they've always done it, and it's their destiny to continue doing so. But because of the endless drinking, dwarf history has been lost. \n\nAsbj\u00f8rn is a quite normal dwarf. He loved drinking, he loved play fighting, and he loved hanging out with his friends. Usually he's up by 8, going right out to drink and eat with all his friends. \nBut today is not usually, he wakes up, and looks at the clockwork hanging on the wall. It's already 3 in the afternoon \"I must have been drinking a lot yesterday.\" Asbj\u00f8rn thinks to himself. \n\nHe walks out and buys some bread to eat, then he goes straight home with a horrific hangover. He goes to bed.\n\nWaking up he doesn't have a headache, but he's not drunk, a state he has never been in before. \"This is weird.\" Asbj\u00f8rn thinks aloud. \n\nHe walks out in the open, it looks to be evening, and everyone is so drunk that they have a hard time walking. Asb\u00f8rn marches across the street, happier than ever. He feels light, and he never wants it to stop. So he decides to stop drinking alcohol.\n\nWhen Asbj\u00f8rn awakes next morning, he's surprised. He can actually remember what has happened. He can remember what happened last night. He immediately runs up to the king, first excusing that he didn't work yesterday, then telling the king about his new discovery. \n\nThe king isn't pleased, he sips from his wine glass, and puts his weight forward to face Asbj\u00f8rn. \"We will keep drinking!\" He says,\" and I'll never command my people to stop drinking, it will be their own choice.\" \n\nSo the next day Asbj\u00f8rn wakes early to make sure he can find his friends before they start drinking. He's lucky, he sees them right before they walk into a pub. He tells them about his discoveries, but they laugh at him too.\n\nSeems like Asbj\u00f8rn has to work harder if he wants the dwarves to stop.\n\n(English is not my first language, please tell me if there's anything that needs fixing.)",

                    "comment": "Only spotted a couple mistakes. \n\n\n&gt;Asbj\u00f8rn is a quite normal dwarf. He loved drinking, he loved play fighting, and he loved hanging out with his friends.\n\nIf Asbj\u00f8rn still likes any of those things, that needs to be in the present tense. Right now it's in the past tense, which implies that he no longer likes doing any of those things.\n\n&gt;But today is not usually, he wakes up, and looks at\n\nMaybe \"But today is not a usual day; he wakes up and looks at...\" First, \"today is not a usual day\" and \"he wakes up\" are two separate thoughts. They need to be separated, either with a period or a semicolon. Because of the way English is structured, \"He wakes up and looks at...\" doesn't need a separating comma.\n\n&gt;\"I must have been drinking a lot...\"\n\nThat's completely fine. \"I must have drunk a lot\" is more common, but both are completely fine.\n\n&gt;He walks out and buys some bread to eat, then he goes straight home with a horrific hangover. He goes to bed.\n\nAbsolutely perfect. I'm mentioning this because I see a lot of native mistakes with then/than, sequence commas (don't know the actual term), and similar with phrases like this. Nicely done. :)\n\n&gt;Waiting up he doesn't have a headache, but he's not drunk, a state he has never been in before.\n\nWaking, not waiting. To wake/to wake up is to get up from sleep. To wait is to spend time while something else happens. Sort of. It's a clumsy definition.  \nAlso, I would change \"he's not drunk, a state\" to \"he's not drunk - a state\". The first phrase first reads like those are two thoughts in a list. The second tells me something closer to what you want.\n\nIt's a clumsy description, but here goes. The second phrasing tells me that the two ideas are related (1) and that the second thought is directly related to and dependant on the first. Dashes can be used like a pair of bookends to separate a thought from the surroundings. An example would be \"I was talking to Sophia - that girl from English class - when you texted me.\" It's a way to describe a thing/word/idea without changing the overall meaning of the sentence.\n\n&gt;He feels light, and he never wants it to stop. So he decides to stop drinking alcohol.\n\nThe word \"so\", in general, means that the phrase is dependent. What you have works, but I would recommend \"He feels light and he never wants that to stop, so he decides to stop drinking alcohol.\" Removing the comma is optional, but I would recommend it.\n\n&gt;When Asbj\u00f8rn awakes next morning, he's surprised. He can actually remember what has happened. He can remember what happened last night.\n\nI would remove \"has\" from \"what had happened\". It's not wrong - it just sounds a little odd. Both ways work; one just sounds better (to me).\n\n&gt;He immediately runs up to the king, first excusing that he didn't work yesterday, then telling the king about his new discovery. \n\n\"First excusing\" is an odd turn of phrase. I know what you mean, which is what's actually important, but it sounds odd. I don't know if it's actually wrong or not, but I'm mentioning this because (I assume) you can't tell what sounds odd. Most of these little things don't really matter that much. English is extremely flexible - you can do all sorts of weird things and it still makes sense - but it's the little things that tell me that English isn't your first language.\n\n&gt;The king isn't pleased, he sips from his wine glass, and puts his weight forward\n\nBecause \"isn't pleased\" isn't an action, I would change this a little. Maybe \"The king isn't pleased. He sips from his wine glass and puts his weight forward\"? If this was a list of three actions/things/whatevers, you'd be right. The best way I can think to describe it is that \"isn't pleased\" is a description of what he is/is feeling, not what he's doing.\n\n&gt;\"We will keep drinking!\" He says,\" and I'll never command my people to stop drinking, it will be their own choice.\" \n\nIt's not actually a mistake so much as a typo, here.   \nI'm going to use = instead of quotation marks when I quote a phrase. That's not standard procedure - I'm doing it because *\"\"drinking!\" He says,\" and\"* is hard to read.  \n=He says,\" and= should be =He says, \"and=. =drinking, it will be their own choice= should probably be two different sentences, but I'm not sure. I'm mentioning it just in case.\n\n&gt;So the next day Asbj\u00f8rn wakes early to make sure he can find his friends before they start drinking. He's lucky, he sees them right before they walk into a pub. He tells them about his discoveries, but they laugh at him too.\n\nI would change \"He's lucky, he sees them\" to \"He's lucky - he sees them\".\n\n&gt;(English is not my first language, please tell me if there's anything that needs fixing.)\n\nThe first time I read this, I didn't notice any mistakes. It was only when I slowed down and carefully looked at it that I actually noticed anything.\n\nEnglish is strange enough that most people have autocorrect going on in their brains whenever they read. Don't worry about whether you mess up or not - we all do. Besides, English is flexible enough that I can say \"am home go chair be time long\" and people can understand me. The sentence is horribly wrong, but the order is mostly right. (Just in case, what I'm essentially saying is \"I'm going to go home and sit in a chair for a while\")\n\nI can even say \"I long chair be go home\" and people can sort of understand me.\n\nYou did excellently. The story is great, the writing is good, and it was a fun read. I hope to see you around on the sub. :)",

The great kingdoms of mankind reduced to quarries for the Dwarves to build their fortresses, the sacred groves and forests of the Elves nothing more than kindling for dwarven forges. \nNoone knew just how it had begun, how this could have happened. Countless tongues cried out to their gods and heard no answer, scholars buried themselves into fruitless discussions, one more outlandish than the other... and the Dwarves conquered. More and more and more, with unending vigor and hunger for victory.  \n  \n  \nThrrustan, 'The Ascended', still lead them onwards with a triumphant grin on his face. He had been the first. The first to ascend. To become more. To realize the full potential of dwarvenkind. Whatever he had done to his people: They had changed, for better and for worse all at once. The differences had been subtle at first, unnoticable to an outsider, but they had spread through dwarven society like a wildfire.\nTheir charming mumbling had disappeared - now, dwarven mouths everywhere gave orders in a cold, harsh language and with painfully precise pronunciation. \nTheir were faster than ever before, scaling buildings and crossing plains with equal ease as if something had set free even more power  in their stout physique. They were tireless now, their cities brimming with the sounds of forges and soldier's boots day and night without pause, as if they had lost all need of sleep.  \n  \n  \nThey were merciful overlords. A year or two passed and the reckless conquerers settled down again, ruling over their realm from sea to sea, undisputed and terrifying in their might. But all was not bad for elves and humans: The far-famed dwarven ale was generously distributed among their long-legged subjects and gave them something to look forward to after a hard day's work while their overlords feasted on whatever game they desired - and paired it with the only drink reserved for their noble palates: Pure dwarven spring water from their old home underground.",

            "comment": "Dolkohm crouched on the gutter of the village inn's roof, standing perfectly illuminated by the inn-keeper's window. Many humans gave him a strange look as they passed by, but they were not his business tonight.\n\nThere, across the street a dwarf named Branren exited the local dwarvish pub, briefly letting out a cacophony of roaring debauchery and indulgence. Dolkohm's eyes narrowed. The stocky, young dwarf stumbled towards the alley he overlooked. He had chosen his post at the darkest nearby alley wisely, for any normal dwarf would find light abhorrent.\n\nDolkohm was no normal dwarf.\n\nHe crept from window to window, staying illuminated as to avoid detection. Branren was mumbling a bar song about rubies and sapphires and tits as he undid his pants and began to piss on the inn's wall. Dolkohm had made this mistake before. He would wait until the ale-drowned dwarf was finished, lest he whirl about in surprise.\n\nAnd finish he did, with an unnecessarily loud and contented grunt. He was just buttoning up his trousers when Dolkohm landed behind him with a deep thud. When Branren turned he was greeted with a polished steel goblin mask.\n\n\"Branren\"\n\nThe sodden dwarf turned to run but quickly stumbled and fell on the garbage strewn through the alley. He turned and gasped in horror as Dolkohm deftly avoided the trash. His swift and accurate movements did not match his dwarvish physique.\n\n\"Woh-wot do yur want mate?\"\n\n\"Vengeance\"\n\nBranren threw some punches, but Dolkohm merely stepped out of the way. In between the drunk dwarf's lunges, Dolkohm jabbed at his sides until the inflictions caught up with Branren and he flopped onto his arse; breathing too hard for a 20 second fight.\n\n\"I tain't done nothin' mate. Yur got the wrong dwarf.\"\n\n\"Last night outside that very pub, you nearly took the eye of Grenmund Flintsbane because he picked up a copper that you swore you 'saw first'. Am I wrong?\"\n\n\"Moradin's hairy arse\", Branren whispered \"Yur a dwarf tain'tya? Too strong for a goblin. And too tall. 'Tah sins of tonight are tah songs of t'morrow'? Umm... 'Ifa yur can drown a fight inna pint, it musta not beena strong swimmer'?!\" Dolkohm stepped closer. \"Ugh, ana... 'an eye for an ale'?\"\n\n\"It's an eye for an eye.\" Dolkohm drew a thin dagger and knelt to Branren's level.\n\n\"Mate I don't ev'n member that. Neither does Gren! We were just sharin a pint! I asked him bout his eye n' he laughed n' said he didn' hava clue!\" Dolkohm gripped the desperate dwarf's throat as he brought the dagger close.\n\n\"You do not receive absolution from drowning your crimes in ale, creten\" He gripped harder as he lined up the dagger. \"Dwarf violence will never stop if there is no punishment. Since there are never any witnesses, punishment must be doled out passively, in the shadows.\"\n\nBranren was blubbering, \"B-b-buh, but.\"\n\n\"Relax,\" Dolkohm gave a twisted smile, \"tomorrow you won't even remember this.\"",

            "comment": "The wind cracked and howled as it whipped about the smooth clearing. Skies of a deep blue-grey loomed in the distance, contrasting sharply with the bright green and dark greys of the grass and stones. All around the clearing, the world fell off, except to the north and south, where massive, moss and grass-painted mountain peaks rose into the whirling grey skies. Within the clearing itself, rounded huts of mortarless grey stone faced inward from the perimeter. The hundreds of stones were fitted together neatly, each stone resting on another, so that the whole structure held itself in place with no fastenings.\n\nRaghare stood outside one of the huts, alone in the howling wind heralding the coming of a mighty highland storm. His deep brown cloak of bear-fur fluttered and whipped at the edges, keeping him dry from the light sprinkling that had taken to the air. He breathed in heavily, taking in the cold freshness of the damp air, the scent of metal and earth and thunder. None of the other had awoken yet. It was not the dwarf way to wake before the sun hits its zenith. Reghare thought back to the stories of his youth, that told that the Earth-mother was jealous of her children, and ordered them only to walk the face of the Earth when the Sun-father was walking away and wouldn\u2019t see them. He smiled. Those stories had always made so much sense to him. Until now, he had not seen the strangeness of it all.\n\nHe had been awake since a little after the sun took to the sky. The sharpness of the damp wind had brought him to life out of his sleep, and to what life it had brought him. While his warriors slept, the Redwood King had awoken to a world of strange clarity. A world that seemed to call him to memories of his childhood with every sound and scent and sight. At first he had thought himself dreaming, but he had come to see that he was not. He was very much awake. He had taken to his post outside the Auldhouse and drifted to thought of the coming day. Perhaps his clarity was a blessing from Frig, for his sacrifice. He had, the night before, not taken any of the ale, and left his portion to his warriors. It was in times of danger and strife that a king\u2019s metal* is truly tested, and Raghare meant to test well.\n\nA boom of thunder rolled across the horizon, carrying the trumpet call of Zoruthane\u2019s lightning across the highlands. With it, the Uiace began. Groans rumbled from within the ancient stonework auldhouses, and dwarfs of every race and creed began to tumble out from behind the curtains in the doorways. Some held their heads, while others found private places to pay Grundir\u2019s Price, hunched over and heaving from the ale and whiskey. Raghare watched with fascination. He had never seen a Uiace from without. Not since he was a child, that is. It was a miserable sight. The pain was palpable. \n\nFrom within the auldhouse beside him, his own warriors moaned and tumbled about, muttering for water, or curses on Grundir\u2019s greed, though these were always retracted with a muttering of thanks immediately afterward. A hand, clad in the leather-coated mail of the Kigoak dwarves, pushed aside the curtain and braced itself against the stones of the doorway. The wetted slabs maintained their grip in the rain from their rough-hewn, sharp edges, and the dwarf within propelled himself out into the sharp wind and drizzle, under a sky ever darkening to a deep grey.\nHe paid the price, and looked up into the Uiace, eyes squinted and red. He turned to his king, stoic and steady in the twisting currents of air, only his bear-fur cloak moved by the sharp flurries, and stumbled to his feet.\n\n\u201cAhhhh...pfft,\u201d he spit.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026.are you well, chieftain?\u201d The umber-bearded dwarf stumbled a little, but caught himself before he totally tumbled over. \n\n\u201cI am spectacular, Addu!\u201d Raghare boomed, and laughed aloud. Groans came from the surrounding dwarves like a tuning orchestra. \n\n\u201cAh, right, chief.\u201d Addu covered his head with his hands and grimaced, \u201cI\u2019ll get the water started, then.\u201d He stumbled off in the direction of the mountain springs on the edge of the cliffs. \n\nRaghare heaved his mighty Daneaxe onto his shoulder, and began to walk around the clearing. More and more dwarves began to make their way out of the auldhouses. A particular tribe had chosen a house each, as was the ancient tradition in grand moots. These same auldhouses had been used by kings and high chieftains of all dwarf kind for generations, gathering in times of great peril to dwarf-kind. In most cases, the leaders grumble and bicker for hours, until they break for dinner and return drunker, happier, and able to settle a deal. The next day is always spent ratifying the details, which results in the most bitter of arguments, and at times brawls, as most of the leaders have no recollection of much of the proceedings of the previous night. Votes are cast by the council at large, and whether or not the deal was actually made the night before, or if it was not and the claimant is mistaken, is determined by the moot as a whole. Once a working treaty is found, the leaders again break for dinner, and return to sign the treaty into law blessed by Grundir.\n\nThis time was different, however. Grumpy, irritable dwarves gulped huge swigs of spring-water, washing down lard and bread, the traditional dwarf Uiace meal. They were quieter than usual. The endless wars that each of the tribes had faced from enemies on all sides had left the dwarvish peoples desperate, hungry, and exhausted. Ale stores had run dangerously low, and the ancient rites and rituals of Raghare\u2019s people seemed doomed to go unperformed for the first time in known history. Perhaps it was in his time of greatest need that Frigg had chosen to bless Raghare. Perhaps this moot was of great significance even to the gods themselves. \n\nRaghare returned to his auldhouse, where he greeted his warriors. They prepared for the council meeting, where the very future of dwarfkind might be determined. There was only one more night's worth of ale on the mountain, and all the warriors and kings knew it. Tensions were high. Dwarves are irritable enough as is, but with no promise of the solace of Grundir\u2019s Gift, most dwarves were already well beyond the point of reason. Raghare helped his warriors pack their gear, clean the auldhouse, perform the rites and rituals of Frig and Zoruthane, and to their own god, Ordor the Bear-king. An hour or more passed, and the camp grew quiet with expectation and tension. A metallic booming from outside the auldhouse rang across the clearing. Raghare picked up his mighty axe and hoisted it on his shoulder.\n\n*it's an intentional misspelling. Dwarves believe their blood to be infused with metal, and to \"test their metal\" is to prove their dwarfishness.\n",

Remember why we\u2019re here, and remember: you\u2019re better than those sods. You got nothing to prove to them.\u201d\n\nA quiet cheer fluttered around the room, and Raghare turned to face the door. With a final prayer to Ordor, he walked to the door, and stepped out onto the clearing, while his warriors and advisors filed out behind him.\n\nThe center of the clearing was completely empty, except for the ancient stones laid out into mysterious shapes and patterns that had adorned it since before the aulhouses. In front of each of the auldhouses, the kings and lords of dwarf-kind stood, surrounded by warriors and advisors of their people.\n\nBeside Raghare\u2019s hut, directly in front of the southern mountain range that stretched off into the ever darkening cloudscape, stood an auldhouse with a mighty gong beside it. Before the gong stood Turadin the White, high king of the mountain dwarves, and leader of the mightiest dwarf clan, the Goldbeards. In his hands he wielded his mace, passed down through countless generations of mountain dwarf high kings. The gong hummed and murmured for what seemed like ages, as every dwarf waited silently for its dull sound to die to the wind. As the sound finally dissipated into the mountains, High King Turadin, clad in his gem-encrusted, deepgold suit of armour, stepped into the circle. The wind toyed with the edges of his long, white beard, but the golden rings at the end of his braids were too heavy.\n\n\u201cThe moot takes root in solid earth, by stone and gem and metal fine, I, High King of the mountain halls and patriarch of the Goldbeard clan, Turadin the White, proclaim the moot begun!\u201d\n\nAs the last syllable left the forest of white hair that obscured most of Turadin\u2019s face, another dwarf leaped into the circle. He was grey-skinned and much thinner than the typically broad-shouldered, hefty dwarves that made up most of the moot. He was thin-bearded and blue-eyed, and moved with a grace and elegance otherwise unknown to dwarf-kind.\n\n\u201cLast night, the high chief of the Picks called me a beardless elf, and you lot laughed. How am I supposed to trust you to spend my people\u2019s resources wisely when you clearly have no respect for us Deepfolk?\u201d\n\nHe had a thin, quiet voice, but the gristle and vigor of dwarfdom was evident in his words and conviction.\n\nAnother dwarf stomped into the circle from the opposite side. His beard was a deep brown, and he was clad in a deep green, hooded shawl.\n\n\u201cWell, Kurzak, if it bloody looks like an elf and talks like an elf, I wager it\u2019s a bloody elf!\u201d\n\nA roar of laughter erupted from all the auldhouses near him. Another dwarf, this one also thin, but with bronzed skin, and a short, well-kempt beard, stepped into the circle. His hair was thick, and hung in dozens of thin braids, decorated at the ends with beads.\n\n\u201cYou should be careful how you speak to the deepones, Brondar. He is not alone in his distaste for sod-loving flower-pickers.\u201d\n\nAt that, the shawled dwarf grabbed a weapon, a wide-bladed short-spear based on the farming tools of his people, and strutted into the center of the circle.\n\n\u201cIf you want to make this a thing, you salty bastard, let\u2019s see how your shells fair against good, hard steel.\u201d\n\nThe thinner dwarf stood still for a moment, before tossing up his head in a shower of clacking beads and jewelery, and laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pass, sod-dwarf. Always so quick to fight, but so slow in everything else.\u201d\n\nThe jewelery encrusted, bronze-skinned dwarf spit on the ground, and turned to walk out of the circle. The other dwarf thrust his spear into the earth, rolled up his sleeves, and shouted,\n\n\u201cAlright, it\u2019s fists then, you bloody pirate, if you\u2019re too much a coward for a proper duel!\u201d\n\nThe other dwarf continued his silent march back to his auldhouse, when a clod of earth thudded into the back of his head, spraying soft, wet highland earth all over the nearby dwarves.\n\nAt that, he spun on his heal and, with a bark of, \u201calright landlubber, we\u2019ll do it the old way!\u201d leaped into the circle and charged Brondar. Before the two could even meet, a roar went up amongst all the dwarves, and the circle was engulfed in the spectacular chaos of brawling, bickering, blundering dwarves.\n\nHigh King Turadin had found the beard of Broki the Black-eye, and was doing his level best to remodel the Kozoki\u2019s face to better suit his name. Sogg Morrbeard was rolling on the ground with two Brackbeards, a hail of fists and kicking feet. He was a legendary warrior, rumoured to have killed three Crocodons while on a fishing canoe, but the mean, dirty Brackbeard pirates were accustomed to being outmatched, and winning. Fron Irengrin waited patiently for dwarves otherwise engaged to stumble into his range, and would let fly with a series of hefty blows from Yiri fists. All around the circle, the moot had descended into stupid, bitter violence. No dwarf brandished a weapon, as the fight had started with fists, and by Zoruthane it would finish with them.\n",

                            "comment": "Raghare looked around himself in bewilderment. What absolute anger from such a petty slight. Surely, his sacrifice had been rewarded with the wisdom of the gods. He had been in so many of these brawls, and even now, his warriors were biting, kicking, punching, and tackling with all the others. He wandered over to the gong, dodging flying punches and hurtling tackles from the hang-over crazed dwarves. He picked up the mighty mace of the High King, and hit the gong with all of his god-blessed might. \n\nIt took a few minutes, but eventually the sound of brawling died down to a steady murmur of whispered insults and slaps. The High King stood in the midst of groaning, bleeding dwarves, one hand holding Lobni Crowstalon up by his shirt, the other ready to pummel the black-haired dwarf\u2019s already bleeding face.\n\n\u201cWhat on mountain\u2019s-peak are you doing, Raghare? We\u2019re sorting things out, here\u201d asked the king.\n\nRaghare breathed in the metallic, electrifying blasts of storm wind, the sky now a deep, midnight blue, pregnant with a highland thunderstorm. He was confident that Frig had blessed him with vision, and with purpose. Today, he spoke to the dwarves on behalf of all dwarfkind. On behalf of the gods in their heavenly drinking halls.\n\n\u201cHigh King, today, I have been blessed by Frig!\u201d\n\nThe dwarves around groaned, and some yelled at him. A few accusations of \u201cbollocks\u201d and \u201che\u2019s just mad he hasn\u2019t got a good kick in yet\u201d fluttered into the din of the approaching storm. \n\n\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d demanded Turadin, his hands still positioned to resume the pummeling on a now conscious, and deeply uncomfortable, Lobni.\n\n\u201cI remember all of the events last night. Everything. The entirety of it. Not a single memory is gone. I have been blessed!\u201d\n\nTuradin looked around at the other dwarf leaders, met with both shakes of the head, and nods of approval. \n\n\u201cIt sounds like nonsense, Raghare. Why aren\u2019t you discussing the moot with the rest of us?\u201d\n\nBefore Raghare could answer, Lobni spoke up,\n\n\u201cI, for one, want to hear what he has to say!\u201d\n\nA round of approving grunts went around the circle, until someone yelled, \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just buying time before he gets pummeled by Turadin!\u201d A round of laughs immediately followed, but Raghare cut them short.\n\n\u201cI tell yah, I can see it all. I gave my ale to my warriors last night, to ensure they had enough to drink..\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, Raghare can drink as many as ten dwarves, that\u2019s true,\u201d someone in the crowd interjected. A round of approving confirmations from the slowly recovering dwarves followed.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Raghare nodded and waved to the crowd\n\n\u201cIt was a noble sacrifice,\" he continued, \"and Frig has given me wisdom for it. I know what happened last night. Kurzak put grass on his head and pranced around the circle, to much laughter, and asked us all if he \u2018looked like an elf\u2019 while he did so. That\u2019s why he called you a beardless elf. You asked him to.\u201d\n\nKurzak appeared from behind several dwarves, quiet and silky as a shadow.\n\n\u201cI...I did?\u201d he muttered.\n\n\u201cYes, you bloody did. You also called Hukrib a two-faced searat. Everyone laughed at that, too.\u201d\n\nKurzak cast a side-long glance at the brown-bearded, braided Brackbeard that had come to his defence earlier. \n\n\u201cAnd it was the calling me an elf that started this debate, right?\u201d Kurzak looked around at the other dwarf leaders, who nodded.\n\n\u201cWell, then, grudge forgiven! On to the next topic!\u201d\n\nThe dwarves all cheered, and went back to their respective auldhouses. Some insults were thrown, and many promises of \u201cnext time\u2019s\u201d followed. \n\nFor the rest of the day, the dwarves argued and bickered, but at every moment that seemed ready to spill into a fight, Raghare spoke up, and settled matters with his strangely impeccable memory for detail. The other dwarves began to trust in his blessing more and more as the events of the night came back to them piece by piece. As the sky swirled, and the drizzle thickened, the dwarves came to terms. Just as the thunder boomed and the rain began to fall heavily, the last signature was added to the 407th Treaty of the Moot. The dwarves wandered back to their auldhouses, gathered their things, and began the long treks back to their respective homes, secure in the promise of aid from their neighbors. \n\nRaghare said the customary goodbyes to the other dwarf kings and chieftains, and for the first time in years, remembered that he actually quite liked those guys. He knew he had fun with them while drunk, but during the sober hours of the day, he had always been so\u2026.grumpy, and had forgotten how strong the bonds of friendship used to be with so many of his kin. A story to tell his great-great-grandchildren. Blessed by Frig and given the wisdom of the gods to ensure the safety of his people at the Moot, under a storm. \n\nAs he went over his retelling of the story, a hand tapped him on the shoulder. He turned to see Addu, nose freshly broken and reset, grinning at him. He proffered a massive bottle, and said,\n\n\u201cOne of the lads won it off a Yuledeg. It\u2019s whiskey and...some other drink, something sweet. I think they called it Ignug. You may have saved dwarfkind today, chief. We thought you might like it.\u201d\n\nRag took the bottle, opened it, and took a whiff.\n\n\u201cAh, yes, that\u2019s good spirit, and sweet, too. Thank you Addu. I trust the lads have enough ale for the ritual, tonight? We\u2019ll be in Tourgavn by tomorrow and can resupply there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, chief,\" Addu said, \"\n\n\"We\u2019ve enough for the night, and thanks to Quadil, you do too!\u201d\n\nRag lifted the massive bottle of Ignug into the now pouring rain, and roared,\n\n\u201cFor Frig, for ale, and for the Kigoak!\u201d A resounding, if damp, cheer went up from his warriors, who all lifted their last whiskey and ale into the sky, and joined their chieftain in a mighty swig.\n\nRaghare swallowed the Ignug in great gulps, enjoying every mighty swig as his chest warmed to the whiskey. This wisdom thing was going to be a lot of fun.\n",

            "comment": "\"So you're telling me,\" Flingrad pushed his ale to the side, though with full intention of finishing it, wiped the remnants of foam from his beard, and sat forward in the wooden chair to rest his arms on the cold, stone table, \"You woke up today, and you felt no urge to vomit?\"\n\n\"I'm telling you, nothing. I felt nothing at all.\" The dim light emanating from the tavern's hearth reflected in Klengrad's wild, wide eyes. It was an expression of wonder and fear Flingrad had never seen in his brother before. \"I stood from my furs and my woman, and I felt... good. Even great.\"\n\n\"The world around you was not spinning.\"\n\n\"No,\" Klengrad went on, \"The meat and potatoes from last night stays in me. Flin, I could look at the sun and feel no pain, I made water and it had no odor, and what's more... I remember. I remember everything that happened last night.\"\n\n\"Ah, horse-piles.\" Flingrad snatched his ale back up and his lips lunged for the clay mug.\n\n\"You don't believe me?\"\n\nFlingrad belched and placed the clay mug back down on the table. \"I'll tell you what I believe. I believe you've gone Elf on us. Or you're going Elf, one of the two. Now, I'm blessed with mother's patience and I'm willing to wait out your little youthful mistake, and in the meantime,\" He reached for his brother's still-full mug, \"I'll will be helping myself to your ale.\"\n\n\"I told you I didn't want any. You're wasting your copper.\"\n\n\"You will, Elf, you will.\" Flingrad brought the mug to his lips and began to drink.\n\nKlengrad smirked, \"You may have mother's patience, but you've also got father's mind. It's beyond you to grasp new ideas or break tradition--\"\n\nFlingrad slammed the empty mug down, cracking the bottom on the table; foam trickled over his leather gloves and hairy knuckles.\n\nA few other patrons glanced over briefly to see what it was over which the sons of Triungrad were arguing.\n\n\"Now, listen, Elf.\" Flingrad pushed the bits of broken clay out of his way, and pointed his finger at his brother, \"What you're doing is an embarrassment. To me, to our father. You think you're crossing into unmarked areas on the map. You think you're gonna try and change our ways with your persuasion? Not while I have a say in it.\"\n\n\"Don't call me 'Elf' again.\"\n\n\"No ale? No early sick? You keep your dinner the next morning like some babe? Next thing you know you'll be shaving your beard in different designs like a man, or maybe it'll fall off altogether. Maybe the sun will bake your hair into a golden color, and you'll be really happy about that, wouldn't you, Elf?\"\n\nKlengrad stood fast, \"I said DON'T BLOODY CALL ME THAT.\" only to be met by his brother.\n\nThe two grasped a handful of the other's tunics, and pulled into each other. They stared with unblinking eyes for a few moments. Their jaws clenched and nostrils flared.\n\nFlingrad let go of his brother's tunic, and chuckled. \"I think the lack of ale has you thinking funny.\" He slapped Klengrad's chest, not with aggression, but neither in jest. He pushed himself from Klengrad's grip, grabbed his pack, and headed for the door. \"See you at the mine. Shift at four bells.\"\n\nKlengrad stood next to their table and watched his brother tip the bartender and apologize for the broken mug and the disruption.\n\nKlengrad knew that someone would understand what he had discovered, someone would listen and give him a chance, but he would have to be cautious of who he told. Many of their clan would take to the new way of thinking much like his brother, and he might face alienation if he kept it up for too long. His friends might not talk to him anymore. Shelana might leave him for another.\n\nMaybe it wasn't even worth it. Maybe there was no suppression of powers from the ale. Maybe he and his kind were meant to live the way they do, drinking from early ages and all hours of the day. Maybe they were not meant to be like elves and men, drinking for leisure.\n\nHe thought of the conversation with his brother, and he felt shame. He felt humiliation. He nodded his head, \"It is an embarrassment...\"\n\nHe had another bell before he would have to head out toward the mine to be there in time for shift-change.\n\nHe held a copper in his hand and fiddled with it, wondering if he should have just one ale for the road.",

In the dwarven society many jobs were considered useless, but fishering work was considered one of the most. At least he did his job well, purging the life out of lakes and rivers in moments. He was able to feed the fortress for centuries, wat would be somewhat valuable if the food stockpiles weren't overflowing by the others crafts already. \n\n But he did his job well, \"better than the miners that dig so narrow passages; better than the oversser that designed so much many curves and long corridors in the fortress entrance, making the way down the fortress way longer than necessarie; better than the novice armosmith that was crafting such a poor armor that would make fighter prefer go to battle armorless; better than... oh, the pond is dead, my job here is finished\". \n\nLibash went directly to the entrance door, \"let the haulers take care of the fish, I doubt there is barrels to spare storing it, it will rot as alwa...\" pwe, the arrow went right by his head, he went runing to the door that was now locked. \"fuckers let me outside to die\" Libash knew that storie well. When a siege aprachs the overseer will make enormous effort to save the brewer, the metalsmith and even the engraver, but did less than look for the fisherdwarf that acctualy had a reason to be outside, even if there is enough time to let him in. He knew better than bash the door and wait for a response, he bolted right for the pond, the animals would distract the invaders and give him enough time to... drink, Libash was tirstie as hell, with no acess to booze he was subject to one more humiliation: to drink water out of the pond. At least it motivate him \"I can not die know, water shall not be my last drink\" and he drank, and drank and hided and waited. The goblins was now exchanging arrows for bolts with the dwarfs in the towers, the dogs were set loose and were made food for the beak dogs, are newly formed squad was heading outside of the doors, underequipeds and ready to die, \"only a distraction\" he knew, even if one soldier managed to survive the goblins, nothing would escape the warm bath. And it came, glowing, fast, under the pressure of the most experients pump operators, the gods piss killed everyone and destroyed everything except for the valuable metal armor. And it was done. The siege ended, he could only wait, wait for the magma to evaporate to gain acess to the underworld. It took more water and many raw fishes before he could entry the earth. \n\nto be continued",

Aye, you'd rather endure a thousand hells before waking up under an oppressive, open sky.\n\nOh, we had warning alright. Not a soul passes above or below The Prominence without our knowin'. Yet we laughed, we drank, we buggered, and we laughed some more. It had been near o'er a thousand generations since we'd been at war, and we went on happily forgotten by the surface-dwelling fools who slake their thirst on upon the blood of decimated species weaker than them.\n\nBut we are Dwarves! Civilized, cultured, and long-lived! We have nary a care in the world so long as we leave the surface-wilds to it's primitive savages. The same savages that thought their sticks and leathers were brilliant inventions, and tools of power. The same savages who delight and die under the unrelenting gaze of Sul above them.\n\nThe same savages that opened our mountain, and allowed the Eye of Sul to see our home for the first time in all its history.\n\nThe Kingdom of Man came. \n\nThey were different, in a fashion. Their lust for destruction still present, but more dangerous than we'd ever dreamed. They wore strange finery, and held even stranger devices. They brought forth their massive engines and iron claws attached. They brought their giant metal beasts that roared louder than ten Tir-Tolan Deepstalkers and rode them from the inside, soaring 'round and 'round.\n\nThe savages drilled straight into The Pillar of Strength, and in the blink of an eye, \u00dcmsterholm had collapsed under its own weight.\n\nWe were at war for less than one hundred steady breaths before it was over. Somehow, I survived.\n\nSomehow, I *remembered.*\n\nEdit: Never tried one of these before. Sorry if it's shit:x",

Her yellow eyes were squeezed shut not in fear, but in pain. Her heart raced and her throat burned. What she wouldn't have given for just one little sip of ale. The memory of the bitter, earthy taste of a Vordin Ale. . .\n\nHer eyebrows furrowed as she opened her eyes. \"Earthy taste?\" Her dry lips parted enough for her to croak out her thoughts. \n\nSince when did she rember the taste of the ale she drank? She could even remember the last time it graced her lips. Two days ago, to be exact. She had only begun her morning drinks when a supposed Mining Supervisor ordered her to follow him back to work. A surprising and swift thud to her head had caused her to lose all thoughts from there, until she woke up in a cage surrounded by more cages in what she assumed was Human territory. The bastards had jumped her and quite a few others by the look of it.\n\nA loud gonging reverberated through the room as two armored individuals escorted in a lithe, cloaked figure. Screams and angry shouts greeted them, but violence was their answer. One of the guards sneered and ran a sword through one of the cages, sneezing the room, save for a few sobs and gasps.\n\nThe dwarf gasped, pushing herself as far back in her cramped cage as possible. What did they want? Who were they? Why were they doing this? \n\nClank!\n\nA cage door opened somewhere near her before she heard the sultry voice come from the cloaked figure. \"Disgusting. Dispose of this one. There are five others. Burn the bodies.\"\n\nThe two guards began shuffling around as the woman continued her inspection. When she leveled with the dwarf's own cage, here blue eyes glinted from the flickering flames dangling from the ceiling. \"Promising,\" was all she murmured before turning to the doorway. \"Feed and water that one. She will also need her sleep. She may last after all.\"\n\nHer cheeks burned with fear and anger. She wanted to fight and scream, but she had no energy. Her nerves were jumbled and she was at a loss for words. What was happening to her? \"Please,\" she finally whispered before gripping the bars with her tanned fingers. \"Please just. . .one drink. Of ale. Please.\" That was what she needed. With it, she would be renewed. Focused. Without it she was weak and confused. If only she could fool them into allowing her one drink.\n\nThe woman stopped in the doorway for only a moment before looking to the guards. \"Water and a small meal. Enough to survive.\"\n\nWhy? She sunk to the floor, tears welling in her eyes. Why? Rage suddenly overtook her and her blood boiled. \"Who are you people?\" she kicked the bars, causing her cage to rattle. \"Monsters! Let us go!\" She was in a frenzy, thrashing about in what little room she had. \"Dirty human trash! Elven bastards! Dogs! Filth!\"\n\nSomething suddenly pierced her hip and her body quickly became limp. Her eyelids drooped as she heard her door open. \n\n\". . .her to. . .feed. . .\"\n\nThe guard hovering over her faded from view as she lost consciousnesses. ",

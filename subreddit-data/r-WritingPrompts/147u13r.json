I see a shape moving quick across the blue sky; it looks like a hawk swooping through the wind.\n\nBut that noise. That roar like a bear reverberates through my chest. I take a tenative step further into the trees as I hear a second roar answer.\n\nNow there are two shining hawks swooping at each other. I am entranced. They usually have been flying together, but these two seem... aggressive.\n\nI watch these birds for a time. They dance and swerve at one another for a time. Then, I hear a sound like a stream suddenly ripping through overhead and see a smokey trail leave the one like a tongue and streak toward the other.\n\nA deafening crack and boom comes with a blinding flash, like lightning.\n\nI bolt. Instinct drives my hooves into the dirt and pushes me away from the hail of flaming wreckage, of death. I look back to see trees aflame and a cloud of smoke rising. Another cloud, this one white, gently lowers a man-shape off towards the opposite horizon. I don't bother wondering where they came from: the sky is strange today.\n\nI'll find another place to graze; these birds are too noisy.",

            "comment": "I had been in this nice updraft for a while, soaring ever higher, when I heared the noisy ones approaching. But something is different. Normally, they fly like the geese during migration, one at the others wing, straight ahead. A very fast, very loud, very smelly pair of geese. Today, they don't. Today, they seem to dance. One moves in one direction, the other follows. Is this their mating ritual? It's certainly intricate, they show off how great they are at flying. Probably the female testing if the male is up to catching her. Ah, and there, the male who follows has just sent some kind of gift in the females direction. She lets it fly past her, though. So the male hasn't proved himself enough yet. Good for her, you should only ever choose a male that has proved worthy after all. They continue their strange dance again, the male sends a gift her way. This time, she responds by dropping a number of smaller things that leave smoke in the air, but again, the males gift is just ignored. She is hard to please, that one. It can't be his flight, he matches her well. Rising up into the sky chasing after her with amazing speed, rolling when she does and then a nosedive to the ground that is left at the last second. It's beautiful to watch if one ignores that they nearly make my ears bleed. Maybe she doesn't approve of the gifts? Who knows with the noisy ones. \n\nAfter a few more seconds, the male tries again. And this time, she accepts his gift! She looses a few feathers from her right wing where she caught it, it came in with that much speed. She immediately heads for the ground while he soars into the sky in triumph. Strange, why would he not follow her to mate? Shortly before she reaches the ground, she throws out a white plume. It falls very slowly and is still in the air when she reaches the ground and marks her nesting area with a disgusting cloud of horribly smelling smoke. That is certainly effective, no one will dare go anywhere near that! Maybe that is their egg? Gosh, I REALLY hope they only raise one chick. I don't need the skys full with a whole swarm of the noisy ones, I wouldn't have an hour of peace anymore...",

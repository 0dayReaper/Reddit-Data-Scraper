            "comment": "A smile, a snicker, and a twitch of the eye.  The devil himself sees the perverse joy in her eyes, and for the first time since Michael threw him from Paradise, Lucifer seems frightened.\n\n\"So I get to see their entire lives, I know it all in a single moment and I get to decide how to punish them?  My choice alone?  Completely up to me?\" She almost drools with anticipation, like a dog slavering over a raw steak.  She stares outward, seemingly through Lucifer, into the oblivion of Hell itself.\n\n\"Yes.  Your choice alone.\" The devil casts a sidelong gaze at her.  Not once in the history of the world, in all the eons and millennia that humans have walked the Earth has a moral accepted his offer.  \"But again, if you take up this mantle, it shall be your eternity.  Your hell will be to exact penitence against those misguided souls who find themselves cast into this dark dimension.  Your personal punishment would be to view the eternal suffering of your fellow--\"\n\n\"Yeah I gotcha.  Personal hell all that.  What you don't seem to understand, big and pretty, is that I've seen the worst that humanity has to offer.  I've had to see a child beaten for asking for candy.  I've cleaned miscarriages from the bathroom floor.  I've had to break up a fight between a 25 year old man and a 75 year old woman, a fucking fistfight mind you, over a Goddamn...I can say that without worry now I guess, damage is done... Over a Goddamn beanie baby.  Do you KNOW what a beanie baby is?  It's a cheap piece of shit stuffed animal filled with plastic beads.  A grown ass man fought an old woman for it.\" She wrings her hands frantically.  \"I've had to sit back, and watch with a smile as my co-workers got berated over us running out of bread during a storm.\"  She doesn't seem to notice as Lucifer begins to fidget uncomfortably.  She also doesn't notice that her bronze skin has taken a reddish tint.\n\n\"Kianna, your soul will never recover from this if you accept.\" Lucifer warns.\n\n\"My soul?  It was crushed by the third year working during Christmas. When you walk in on Santa raw-dogging an elf over the Frozen display in back... You don't come back from that. I never watched that movie again afterwards.\" A wistful look washes over her face, dreaming of the days before she had seen such horror.\n\nLucifer cringes at the thought of it.  \"Kianna, make sure you understand what you are accepting.  You will cease to be a human soul, you will become a demon, one of the fallen.  I see it happening already.  Your skin is changing and if you reach up and feel your head...\"\n\nKianna does so and smiles feeling the rising bumps.  She grits her teeth and smiles into the face of Satan, solidifying her resolve. Horns erupt from her head, her skin smolders and steams, taking on a red hue, her feet change into hooves, she smiles up at the devil again, a sinful grin.  She cracks her knuckles and turns her neck, cracking the vertebrae.  \"Alright big and pretty, bring out the gimp...I got some shit to work through.\"\n\n\nEdit: Damn thanks for the silver!",

            "comment": "\"So what you're saying is...I'm in hell?\" She glanced around the plain white room she was standing in, then back to the used-car-salesman looking guy in front of her. He looked to be in mid-thirties and reminded her of a Kennedy, except for his yellow eyes and ugly tan suit.\n\n\"Where's the fire?\"\n\n\"People always ask about the fire! Look, honey, your priorities need to be in order. Like hello! Devil here!\" He waved and gestured to his cheap suit \"And besides, Catholics made that up. I refuse to add fire just to cow to mortal expectations.\"\n\nHis bitter tone gave the impression that this was an arguement he'd had with people before.\n\n\"...Okkkkay?\" She crossed her arms over her chest and sighed when she realized she was still in her Wal-Mart Uniform. \n\nCrushed underfoot by the sweaty masses, she couldn't believe it. She picked at her nametag. Claire Haskill, deli clerk. Dead at 31 because of 50% off TV's.\n\n \"Why am -I- here?\"\n\n\"Oh, lots of reasons. But the main one involves a girl named Sally Cushings, fourth grade. The toothpaste incident.\" A cruel smile twisted over Lucifer's unnaturally handsome face. \"So creative.\"\n\nShe almost argued with him.\n\n\"Yeah, okay, that's fair.\"\n\n\"Ha! And that's what I'm looking for. Creativity! Passion!\" He gave a short wave of his hand and two chairs appeared in the middle of the room. \"Sit, sit.\"\n\nClaire hesitated only a moment before flopping into her conjured chair. Lucifer undid the buttons on his suit and smoothed it down as he settled into the seat across from her.\n\n\"So, Claire, I have an offer for you. No one ever takes me up on it but I guarantee that it's a -huge- upgrade from the usual package.\" \n\n\"Can I leave?\" \n\n\"Good God no!\" He laughed \"No no, but Hell has had a massive overcrowding problem ever since they installed slot machines in airports. My guys and I can't keep up, so I've been trying to outsource some of the torture and punishment. Humans are surprisingly squeamish.\"\n\nShe stared at him for a weighty moment.\n\n\"You want me to torture people?\"\n\n\"Excatly! I'd put you in charge of a small group, maybe 100 souls? You could do -whatever- you like to them.\"\n\nClair felt a smile touch her face. Her first real, genuine smile since she had pulled on her tacky blue apron.\n\n\"....-Whatever- I want?\"\n\n~.~.~.~.~\n\n\"E-excuse me?\"\n\nClair turned from stocking chocolate milk and arched a brow at the soccer-mom lady standing in front of her.\n\n\"I have this coupon,\" one trembling hand extended a worn, crumpled piece of red paper towards Clair. \"I won it in the...the cart corral race? I'd like to redeem it.\"\n\nClair took the cupon and glanced at the front.\n\n\"Oh that's great! A get out of hell cupon, you must have beaten a -lot- of souls for this.\" Claire smiled warmly at the woman, who gave a shaken smile back. \"Let me see here.\"\n\nClaire turned it over--\"Oh, I'm sorry, it looks like your coupon is expired.\"\n\n\"What?! But I just got it!\" Karen (Claire called all the women Karen and all the men 'Dave', it was just easier) sounded both pissed off -and- desperate. \"Let me speak to your manager!\"\n\nClaire's lips turned up until the tips of her pointed teeth were visible, poking out over her lip. An evil laugh spilled from her mouth as Karen shrank down in fear. Her new demon voice was great for this, deep and echoing through the infinate asiles of Hell-Mart.\n\n\"I am the manager.'\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "  \n\n\u201cAlright, who is excited for our big Black Friday deals?!\u201d Jim called out to the crowd of customers clustered in front of his store, desperately trying to keep his voice cheerful and optimistic. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be excited when you shut the fuck up and let us in!\u201d retorted man about twenty spots back, huddled into his hoodie, shooting daggers at Jim as though it were his fault that corporate had specifically mandated he couldn\u2019t let people in until midnight exactly. All Jim could do was sigh as he swore to himself that this would be his last Black Friday. He tried his best to ignore the voice in the back of his head reminding him he\u2019d made that promise to himself this day every year for the last fifteen years. \n\n\u201cOkay guys I know you\u2019re all excited for the new Playstation 7 but as I\u2019ve said, I unfortunately only have twenty systems to sell. We\u2019re hoping to get more in the next few days but that\u2019s all I have right now.\u201d\n\nA general murmur went through the crowd as people lined up more closely and calculate where exactly they fell in the line. Of course, Mr. Hoodie fell right at spot number twenty-one. \u201cWHAT THE FUCK!?!\u201d he roared, as the realization dawned on him. \u201cYOU\u2019RE TELLING ME I\u2019VE BEEN WAITING HERE FOR FOUR HOURS AND I DON\u2019T EVEN GET ONE!?!\u201d\n\nJim groaned to himself, wondering where exactly his life went wrong and how exactly he ended up here. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, trying to defuse the situation \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but that\u2019s all I have. I had a sign posted on my door this whole time saying that I only have that many and I also sent out an employee a half hour ago to make sure everyone knew.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to bring up the fact that someone had thrown a half-eaten bagel at the poor girl and she came running back inside crying hysterically as she tried to pull cream cheese out of her hair. \n\n\u201cI DON\u2019T CARE!\u201d Mr. Hoodie roared, spittle flying from his lips, \u201cI\u201dVE BEEN WAITING HERE AND I DESERVE MY SYSTEM!\u201d \n\nAt that moment, shouting incoherently, Mr. Hoodie made a small yet life-altering decision- and decided to cut in line in front of the person in ahead of him. \n\nUnfortunately for him, that person was about six inches taller and had about fifty pounds more muscle than he did. \u201cYou get the fuck back to your spot, jackass!\u201d the larger man growled as he shoved him. Mr. Hoodie stumbled backwards- right into customer #22, a high-strung mother who had stepped up and was in the middle berating Jim and demanding to speak to his manager. \u201cYOU\u2019RE RUINING MY CHILD\u2019S CHRIS---\u201d was all she got out before Mr. Hoodie slammed into her. The no-foam, quadruple shot, extra hot, extra caramel, soy latte she had only moments before been brandishing under Jim\u2019s nose like a saber splashed right into his eyes. All went black as Jim stumbled forwards- right into the fist the Mr. Muscles had been throwing at Mr. Hoodie. \n\nJim collapsed to the ground and at that exact moment the doors to the store opened and customers rushed into the store in a mad stampede, heedless of Jim\u2019s unmoving body on the ground. The last thing Jim remembered feeling was countless feet trampling him and a deep sense of regret. \u201cI really should have finished college..\u201d he thought to himself as he lost consciousness. \n\nJim suddenly bolted upright. He was in a small room and sitting in front of him was a small man in a red suit and pointed goatee. Grinning to himself mischievously, the man extended a hand and said, \u201cHello, Jim. Let\u2019s get the small things out of the way: you\u2019re dead, this is hell, I\u2019m the devil and have I got a proposition for you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo let me get this straight,\u201d Jim said, his mind still trying to process everything as they walked along a corridor. \u201cI\u2019m dead and we\u2019re in hell. That I get, but instead of torturing me like everyone else- you want me to work for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Satan said, still grinning. \u201cI\u2019ve had my eye on you for some time. Fifteen years in retail- that\u2019s some torture even I have a hard time replicating. Quite frankly, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much else I can do to you. You\u2019ve seen it all. Remember the Furiibo shortage of 2023?\u201d Jim shuddered as he tried to repress the memories, \u201cI try not to.\u201d \u201cExactly!\u201d Satan proclaimed, \u201cEven I\u2019m not sick. Seriously, man, you\u2019ve been through hell already! No, you Jim, have been through far worse in life than I could have ever thrown at you here in hell. Instead, I\u2019ve decided to make you an offer. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve made this offer to others in the past, but they\u2019ve always turned me down- but I think you\u2019ll be the first to take me up on it. Work for me, you\u2019ve seen so many things that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be quite creative in your punishment of the sinful and forsaken, and I think you\u2019ll find the afterlife quite comfortable.\u201d \n\nSuddenly Jim realized they had stopped outside a nondescript door. Moaning could be heard from the other side. \u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d Jim asked, nodding towards the door. \u201cA signing bonus, one I think you\u2019ll appreciate more than any of my other minions.\u201d \n\nThe door swung open and shacked to chairs were Mr. Hoodie, Mr. Muscles, and Soccer Mom. \u201cThere\u2019s thousands of others. Every customer you\u2019ve ever had, every person who treated you poorly. They\u2019re all yours. All you have to do is agree. \n\nJim felt a smile slide onto his first time in fifteen years as he asked, \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d",

Do I get a pitchfork or what?\"\n\n The Devil stopped whirling his trident, his mad laughter dropping to more of a slightly crazed giggle.\n\n \"Okay, uhhh...what?\" The red-skinned fiend looked puzzled, pulling out a small black notebook which was decorated with tiny cartoon pitchforks, \"I've got you here on multiple counts of petty theft, lying, threats of harm against others...nothing I see here suggests you'd be on the level of a Hitler or Stalin. What's your deal?\"\n\n \"Sir, I worked retail for *fifteen* fucking years. I was killed in a stampede of shoppers.\" \n\n The Devil took a step back, \"Ah,\" he replied, as if it all made sense now. \"Listen, I don't really think you belong down here getting tortured. After fifteen years as a wage slave, I'm actually impressed you didn't kill anyone,\" he dropped his voice and slid closer to the damned soul as if sharing a secret, *\" Most veterans of retail do, you know\u2014their managers never know what hits them.\"*\n\n \"Trust me, I thought about it. Seriously though, when do I start?\" \n\nThe Devil handed his pitchfork out for the soul to take, \"Shit man, you can start right away.\" He pointed down a long and darkened hallway, \"Walk straight down that hall until you see the three-headed dog, take the first left and proceed through the fires of everlasting woe, and straight through the P.E.T.A. meeting-\"\n\nThe damned soul interjected, \"Wait, P.E.T.A. is actually evil, not just incompetent?\" \n\nThe Devil smiled broadly, \"They kill more defenseless animals per year than any other organization. Face it, blood sacrifices are hard to come by, these guys fill the niche in the market. Anyway, once you get down the last flight of stairs, you'll be in the department of bad managers. I'm going to make you head of the torture division there.\" \n\n The damned soul smiled broadly, \"I'll get right to work, Sir.\"\n\n\nAs he walked off, the Devil shivered. \"Remind me to never get on the bad side of those retail workers. They give me the fucking creeps.\"\n\n_______________________________\n/r/SirLemoncakes\n\n",

The first is the \u201cpenn and teller\u201d level (they reported on this in \u2018bullshit\u2019):  This is where you find out peta kill pets given to them and in fact they want the concept of pets to end. \n \nBut there is one more level: You know how the US has bad health care? This is true for pets too. Getting your pet euthanized is expensive. And: many places refuse to do it* - peta does provide that service though.  Which means that their statistics show a lot of euthanized pets. \n \nThere are a lot of companies interested in slandering an animal rights organization. So the guy who constantly shows up in the Penn and Teller show for example is from an org that is (not even secretly) paid by them. \n  \nAnd he insinuates that people bring their healthy pets to peta for a bit - and then peta constantly say \u201cOOPS sorry your dog died lol don\u2019t know how that happened!\u201d Which is of course not a thing that actually happens. \n\nIf you think that they do that, on a large scale, you are literally believing in propaganda by big corporations, and you need to examine the situation. Again, I think peta suck in many ways, but I also believe in truth, and this is one of the most obvious cases where otherwise informed people believe in lies that I know of. \n\n________\n* Many shelters refuse to euthanize pets BECAUSE these statistics keep getting read as \u201coh so they MURDER MY HEALTHY PETS?\u201d instead of \u201cThey provide a service for suffering animals\u201d",

            "comment": "The Devil had a near infinite capacity for patience. That was a different thing from saying that the Devil never got testy or annoyed from having to bide his time \u2013 the Devil understood that there were things worth waiting for, like the gradual corruption of the most pious men and women, or the inevitable collapse of Heaven. Mostly, though, no one liked to keep the Devil waiting, and so things had a tendency to work themselves out neatly.\n\nPenelope Milsson, though, was really pushing the envelope here.\n\n\u201cYou do know that when I summon you, I *expect* you to come to my office *immediately*?\u201d \n\n\u201cBut I did, Boss,\u201d said Penelope, as she furrowed her brow in recollection. \u201cI heard the bleating of the goat-horns over the PA, so I dropped all that I was doing, and then I rushed along to meet-\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you do know that I can *see* you throughout Hell, right?\u201d said the Devil, a mercurial hint of exasperation in his voice. \u201cI was looking at you at this screen right here the whole time! You took your own sweet time to log off your terminal, then you stopped by the canteen for a pudding, *then* you popped by HR *before* you came here! Do you also have explanations for those?\u201d\n\nThe Devil had to give Penelope credit \u2013 she barely missed a beat. \u201cOh Boss, you know the promise I made to you when I first came to Hell? When you offered me this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity? I told you I would always make the job my first priority, and I meant every word of it! You couldn\u2019t have expected me to believe that you were actually instructing me to *defy* you, yes? That wouldn\u2019t have made any sense at all, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d\n\nPenelope\u2019s smile was beatific, so much so that the Devil wanted to sink his claws right into her insufferable expression. But she was right. It was poor form to punish her for his\u2026 oversight. Besides, beating up on Hell\u2019s Star Employee of the Year was just poor optics no matter how the Devil looked at it.\n\n\u201cWe will discuss again the manner in which you manage your priorities,\u201d said the Devil. \u201cFor now, there\u2019s something a bit more urgent at hand. What\u2019s this I hear about the plummeting morale in the Hellish Fiend and Craven Demon departments?\u201d\n\n\u201cMorale is plummeting?\u201d said Penelope, her mouth agape and a hand on her chest for emphasis. \u201cIn those departments? Surely that cannot be? They are the cream of the crop, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are blaming *you*, in fact. They have specifically named one Miss Penelope Milsson, 35 years of age at the time of passing, for \u2013 let me quote them directly \u2013 *\u2018destroyeth the naturale orders of the Underworld with unnaturale and cruele and unusuale means of punishment for the piggies known as Humans\u2019*.\u201d The Devil paused here, then fixed a gleaming red eye on Penelope. \u201cYou have anything to say about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it is a bit rich, ain\u2019t it,\u201d said Penelope. \u201cI mean, they are the ones with the whips and the fangs and the claws and they are accusing *me* of being sadistic?\u201d\n\nThe Devil sighed. He felt the tiny drumming of an incipient migraine start up in the frontal lobes of his brain. \u201cI told you time and again, yes? Just do what all your predecessors have done. Just\u2026 beat the humans. Boil them. Flay them. Don\u2019t rock the boat, just stick to the script. How hard can that be? Is that too much to ask?\u201d\n\nPenelope crossed her arms, and a mutinous glint entered her eyes. \u201cHave I ever let you down, Boss? Have my numbers ever proven my methods wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe numbers are good, it\u2019s just that-\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did you not clap me on the back, right on stage and in front of your infernal hordes, when you gave me the Trident for Employee of the Year? Did you not point out how I was a sterling example of what all creatures should strive to be? Did you not wax lyrical over the bleedin\u2019 innovation I brought to this fine establishment?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I did, I did do all that,\u201d said the Devil, who vaguely felt like he was losing control of the conversation. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking is that-\u201d \n\n\u201cThe results don\u2019t lie, Boss! Look! Look at your precious screen! Once word got out of how truly *nasty* it is in Hell now, there\u2019s been a significant and quantifiable uptick in good behavior on Earth! A dozen new splinter religions have been established, just so that more of the fringe believers can be routed off to Heaven! I even brought you the internal circular they were sending around Up Above, yes? The one where they said that dear old Lucifer has never ran as tight a ship as he is doing now, do you remember?\u201d\n\nThe Devil sighed again. He did remember. It was a nice feeling, to know that there were others who were once again giving him the due respect and recognition he deserved. He was the one who had picked out Penelope from the masses anyway, who had first sniffed out her talents and then took her under his wings. Which, of course, only made this meeting all the more awkward.\n\n\u201cLook, all I\u2019m asking is, don\u2019t be such a bloody show-off,\u201d said the Devil. \u201cYou know how the Hellish Fiends and Craven Demons are. They are *old*. They can\u2019t change their ways as fast as you can. Stop showing them up and making them unhappy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with a little natural selection?\u201d asked Penelope. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault they are so tethered to the old ways. Would it hurt if they just spent a little effort studying how they can maximize suffering with the minimal amount of effort?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have whips!\u201d said the Devil. \u201cAnd they have claws! That\u2019s about it! What else do you expect of them! I give them humans, they torture them with their immortal instruments, and that\u2019s it! That\u2019s the end of the story!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot good enough,\u201d sniffed Penelope. \u201cNot good enough. As I told you during my interview, I think my time at retail has given me the sort of training your Horde has never had. Do you know what separates the best retail workers from the scum? It\u2019s understanding the human condition, that\u2019s all it is. You don\u2019t believe me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what relevance that has to anyth-\u201d \n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand your customers, how can you expect to serve their every need?\u201d said Penelope, a train without any brakes whatsoever. \u201cI was forced to pick up the smallest mannerisms, study the slightest inflections, just so I could know what sort of customer I was dealing with. When I was alive, I was the best, bar none. A woman could walk in and I would know if she was shopping for herself, her girlfriends, her significant other or her child. I could pacify the gnarliest children, I could entertain the grumpiest grandparents. There was no one else quite like me. And I will give you the answer you have been looking for.\u201d\n\nBefore the Devil could object, Penelope stood and whipped out a folder she had been hiding behind her back. The smug smile on her face unsettled the Devil more than he would admit.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this now?\u201d asked the Devil.\n\n\u201cThe reason why the other departments are complaining. They are achieving an ROI of only about 50% - that\u2019s 1 unit of human suffering for every 2 units of effort. My department? Well, we\u2019re up to an ROI of 200%. Yes, you heard that right. We\u2019re *four times* more efficient than they are. For every unit of effort we sink in, we extract 2 units of suffering. Two, whole, units!\u201d\n\nThe Devil took a deep breath, then opened the folder as gingerly as he would have if he was handling a vat of holy water. The words did not make sense at first, but the pictures certainly helped. A fine bead of sweat broke out on his brow as understanding set in.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 asked all sufferers to indicate whether they wished to be with their parents? And when they answered yes, you put them with their parents\u2026 *in-law*?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot my fault that they were not specific,\u201d said Penelope, a grin on her face.\n\n\u201cAnd when any sufferers begged to be reunited with their children, you agreed without telling them that you would be returning to them the six-month-old versions of their children?\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, not my fault,\u201d said Penelope. \u201cTime has a different meaning here, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when they asked to meet again with the loves of their lives, you returned their very first crushes to them? And you played recordings of all the things they did to woo said first crushes?\u201d\n\nPenelope bared her teeth in her widest grin yet. \u201cI\u2019m particularly proud of that one. Seems like no matter how old people get, they never forget the embarrassment of those early years. And there\u2019s more too. People who are fussy get prison cells which are slightly off-proportions, people who are vain get zit outbreaks every morning, people who love dogs get cats as companions\u2026 the list goes on. And on. And on. I\u2019ve got a few more folders, just like those.\u201d\n\nThe Devil slammed the folder back onto the table, the steam rising from his forehead. He cricked his neck, then forced himself to speak again. It was always hard to back-pedal.\n\n\u201cHow about\u2026 I make a recommendation for you to\u2026 ascend to Up Above,\u201d the Devil said. \u201cOn account of your brilliance and such. Hell\u2019s no place for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh not, not yet,\u201d said Penelope. \u201cI\u2019ve not accomplished my goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd which are?\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy,\u201d Penelope said as she began to rise. \u201cI won\u2019t leave until I get Employee of the Century. It\u2019s a personal pride thing, I hope you understand.\u201d\n\n--- \n\n/r/rarelyfunny \n",

Could you explain to me please?\"\n\nI sit here with Lucifer telling him about my experience working in retail. I tell him about Jason, he was a good guy and the only thing that made retail somewhat bearable during the first few years. He would show me memes and had lunch with me sometimes. I liked Jason. Then I tell him about Douglas. Douglas was the boss that fired Jason and made everything a living hell. He was never on my side and often bickered on the customer's side even if they were incredibly wrong and he knew it. He bothered me during lunch break telling me he did not hire me to sit around for 36 minutes when I have a 35 minute lunch break.\n\nI tell him about that lady with the kid. The kid was running through the store and knocked things on the ground which gave Douglas an excuse to yell at me. I tell him about the lady who could not find the jeans even though I showed it to her around five times. And how she would scold me when I said \"Do you really need me to show you again?\" After showing her the fifth time. She then stormed out after calling me, and I quote \"A rude little fucker who works retail and will never be anything.\"\n\nThen I tell him about that fat fuck, who trampled me carrying the tv on sale for 70% off. He asked where the tvs were and smelled like he had not put on deodorant for at least a week or two. He tried talking to me and asked me to show him where the televisions were gassing me further. He then waddled on my body pressing it into the ground. He sent me here and he was rude beforehand. I have dealt with those I am going to torture. I won't feel bad.",

His hair was a beautiful gold, and his eyes were a deep blue that would be easy to get lost in, if the young woman wasn't so excited.\n\n\"Definitely. I know exactly how to do it too. Please, just give me the job, I want to do this,\" the young woman pleaded, surprising the devil.\n\n\"Hold on, why do you want to do this so badly? The worst you've done is lying and hurting someone, why are you so excited to hurt people so much?\"\n\n\"It's only fair. People can be so cruel to us, screaming, yelling, sometimes even trying to hit us, it's much worse than this hell,\" she says shrugging softly.\n\nThe devil paused for a moment before looking the woman over, now noticing just how 'well dressed' she was. A simple black baseball cap, blue jeans, and a simple green shirt...plus two extra items. A blue vest with white trimming and words, as well as a pin that stated her name.\n\n'Luna'\n\nThe rest was faded or broken.\n\n\"So you worked in retail? And how did you die there? The employers are normally good about that stuff,\" the devil said softly.\n\n\"Black Friday. Sometimes people get too excited. Now can I please get to work, this is basically the only job I'm excited for,\" she responded happily, bouncing on her toes a bit.\n\nAfter a moment, the devil agreed and handed the woman a key card on a chain. She smiled before taking the card and chain, carefully putting it on her neck and walked away, ready to get started with her new job.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nA few months later, the young woman sat on her throne like chair, smiling as she looked down at her work. Everyone who had done exceptionally cruel work, was now forced to do your old job; retail work.\n\nMany souls who were unfortunate enough to join the ranks, soon learned just how horrible they had been to other people, but were forced to continue their work until the devil himself decided that they could rest, which rarely happened.\n\n\"You're surprisingly good at this,\" he said softly, standing beside the young woman who simply smiled. She had done her job, both in life and in hell. To her, it was a job well done, one that moved her from simply torturing cruel souls, to becoming the devil's right hand man.",

He never throws his garbage away, instead he insists on littering almost daily. Change his mind.\u201d\n\nWe watched H6 for nearly 10 minutes. Her warmth enveloping me as if She were behind me and next to me simultaneously.  I wasn\u2019t sure what she meant until H6 threw a cigarette butt out his window. Suddenly an urge over took me and H6 crashed into a utility poll. The crash led to a massive explosion which then led to a 6 acre brush fire. I sat there stunned as several of the remaining monitors flashed wildly as their respective Truman\u2019s were either injured in the accidents or otherwise affected.  It all happened so fucking fast and I began feeling fuzzy and sick. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore! I don\u2019t... he didn\u2019t deserve all that!\u201d I realized I was shouting to no one in particular as She had exited without warning. I grabbed my face and began sobbing. \n\n\u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t fucking easy.\u201d\n",

We fill it with the bare minimum employees, but whenever someone asks for help we are always just beyond their reach.\n\nWe'll be shadows at the corner of their eyes whenever they come in looking after for some batteries or a return they have from another store. Once inside we seal off the front end portal and black out the windows. We shut off the lights section by section starting drom the front. We would leave our stations and vacate the premise for the next part when the store blacks out.\n\nAt this point, the most ignorant customers break out their phones and flashlights.

            "comment": "The Devil blinked, surprised. Which was no easy feat, all things considered. After all, he *was* Satan, Prince of Darkness, Ruler of Demons, Evil One. He'd seen it all. Literally. He could still recall the clusterfuck of 1945, when Adolf had finally  hopped off the mortal coil and passed through to the Underworld. An absolute shitshow. Everyone had wanted a piece of good old Hitler, all Nine Circles clamouring over where he should stay for the rest of Eternity. Hell had threatened to break through into the Realm of Man that day. Administrating that fiasco was indubitably the greatest headache The Devil had ever experienced. \n\nLincoln Todd was no Hitler. And yet The Devil felt a familiar gnawing pain curl around his crimson head as he stared at Hell\u2019s latest entrant. He leaned forward in his skull-adorned seat, elbows resting on a skull-adorned desk, tugging at his flaming goatee. \n\n\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d he said, staring into the mortal's eyes with the fiery intensity of a thousand burning suns. \u201cYou *want* to oversee the torture of all Mankind, for the rest of Eternity?\" \n\n\"Yeah\"\n\nMiffed, The Devil fell back into his chair. He was unremarkable in all regards, this Lincoln Todd. Short, slightly overweight, bespectacled with brown unkempt hair. He still wore the clothes of his Passing; a rumpled navy Walmart shirt and tan cargo pants. His lower jaw jutted out slightly in a clear underbite, giving him a permanent grimace. \n\nThe Devil glanced down at the file he held in his taloned hand, scanning the document for the appropriate details. Hmm. Crushed underfoot in a Black Friday stampede. How humiliating. How pathetic. Even Hitler had swayed at the idea of tormenting the entirety of Mankind, overseeing the fiery jurisdiction of all sinners and evildoers. The concept itself was simply too visceral, too *terrible*, for even the coldest of serial killers. Hence why such a proposition was offered to all entrants of Hell; it struck within them the terrible realisation that in the end, there was always someone *far* more evil. That they were *His* now. \n\nClearly not the case for Mr Pancake over here. \n\n\"So... when do I start?\"",

            "comment": "The proposition was simple enough, torture people in hell,, or be tortured. \n\nIt was the classic kill or be killed scenario, as I had the thought I must've grinned because satan was now grabbing me a set of keys and a pitchfork.\n\"I know it's pretty stereotypical and all but y'know the big guy upstairs apparently has a very specific taste in aesthetics\" \n\nI took my pitchfork and keys down to what I had been informed was the conference room. It was weirdly professional, definitely wasn't like some of those movies where everything in hell is just a  mass of fire, flames and flesh, which made the pitchfork seem extra strange. \n\nI sat down at a table with 14 other people who also accepted the devils offer.\nThey looked like I would expect and I stuck out like a sore thumb, a small blonde woman compared to Jonny B. Thuggins. \nThere was one other person that stuck out, he was a slight man wearing a bland grey t-shirt and black cargo pants, it was so unassuming it was a tad unnerving. \n\nWe sat for a short while before this tall gorgeous brunette woman hurriedly walked in. I could almost hear the jaws hit the floor as she made her way across the room. \nUpon getting to the front her shape morphed, slowly shimmering slightly before it felt like I had blinked the sleep out of my eyes but suddenly this short portly man was standing at the front of the room. I could feel the general mood of the room go from surprise to confusion, almost anger. \nThe short man spoke up.\n\"I am your guide, I will explain how things work here.\" \n\nAfter a while, we had been informed about the workings of hell. It ran on the negative, a supposed attempt at balancing the universe. Because of course the more good, the more bad. \nWe were the ones that needed to counter all the good and we had endless supplies to do it. I even had the ability to shapeshift and control vivid hallucinations to provoke the negative out of people. \nThe worse we were down here the better the universe \"could be\" based on our upsetting the scales. It was an elegant system I guess. and despite my short life as an atheist I was suddenly sure that there was a higher power in the universe, he/she may have been a dick but... he/she's a real dick... so theres that.\n\nIt was also made apparent that being new I'd purposely be put on with people that had \"wronged me\"  didn't quite know what that had meant but it quickly became apparent that wronged has a very broad and vague definition. \nI walked in on my first appointment, each room had a potentially infinite space packed into a 3foot by 3foot closet, each closet had an iron door with a pad of paper stuck to the front,I eyed the paper. \n\n&gt;Doc. Thomas Anthony Brian Williams.\n\nShows that I just missed mr. Unassuming.\nI open the door. Doc. Tom. Is watching in horror as a father cradles his dead newborn violently shouting at the doctor.\nI couldn't hear a thing before I entered, but after I walked in the room changed, doc. Just kinda stared, this was normal for him I could tell he was expecting all kinds of horrible things to happen when the room solidified again.\n\nSomething in me felt a mixture of sympathy and excitement, I seen an opportunity to both be a bit less intense while still getting relatively the same result. I changed the room it was night in the mountains, it was chilly, and the doc. Didn't have a sweater, he walked towards a town into a small caf\u00e9 one I had worked at and knew very well. \n\nHe enters to find me, smiling behind the counter. \nA bit of confusion crosses his face, too normal?\nHe walks up cautiously I could tell he knew something was up. \n\n\"Hello, and good evening sir. Did you need anything in particular?\" \n\"Uh yes, where am I?\" The confusion seems to be causing him distress. \n\"This is the browntown downtown caf\u00e9, we're in downtown browntown.\" \n\"What?!\" \n\"Yes sir! Best coffee in town.\" \nI lean in a bit too close \"I heard it's your birthday, free coffee and croissants for those celebrating,\" \nI wink for effect. \n\"It's not my birthday...\" \n\"Sure it is\" \n\"No it's not\" \n\"Well whens your birthday?\" \n\" august\" \n\"Well its August\" I say gesturing to a calendar I basically pulled out of my ass.\n\" 25th?\" \n\nI hand him a croissant and point to a table, \"yep, happy birthday! I'll be right out with the coffee.\" \n\nI never showed up again. I left him sitting waiting for a coffee that will never come. \n\nI left the room. Looking at the checklist, 8/10\nPops up beside my name on the room. \nAlmost as good as Mr. Unassuming with his 9/10\nSuprising considering the vast difference between our individual methods.\n\n**a week(ish) later** \n\n\"you've maintained a 7/10 average on all your appointments, yet the majority of what you do is just leave them waiting one way or another.\"\nthe question felt weirdly personal despite the vagueness of it. \n\n\"I worked customer service for 15 years my guy, I know all to well that most people get triggered when they've had a bad time and then get told to wait for something perceived as good. I.e. a coffee, or cake.\" The explanation wasn't good enough, satan raised an eyebrow at me.\n\n\"That doesn't seem too bad\" \n\nHe looks at me again with an intensity I'll never get used too. \"Not in and of itself but I've somehow managed to  end up following Jeffery around, the guys fucked up in the head. I've walked in on a lot of dead baby themed rooms, the dude is deliberately traumatizing them like you asked but I feel theres a level of thought to it most of us don't realize.\nEven though he's almost hyperfocused on the dead baby thing he too preys simply on the feeling of helplessnes.\" \n\n\" yes I like his work.\" He says nodding as he eats an apple.\n\n\"The reason both our methods work well together is because his work is more up in your face, deliberately trying to pull the negative, its literal torture for people, to feel completely helpless when your confronted. It's some fight or flight shit but his simulations remove the options to fight or flight.\" \n\n\"Yeah, he knows what he wants and he'll do whatever it takes to get it.\" He says nonchalantly like this is just another tuesday.\n\n\"In doing so he's teaching helplessness, theres nothing they can do about the situation and the people know that, so they freeze. A sort of numbness that comes with the expectation of pain.\"\n\n\" Yeah, I've broken many a person before\" he talks about this with a lightness that I could never wrap my head around. Satan must've been a literal psychopath, able to control the emotional response to things. Once seen him chip a chunk off his horn playing with hellhounds, dude was more vain than even arachne (interestingly enough she was real, the story got a bit warped, it wasn\"t the gods that killed her it was a man... attempting to rape her, she had been stabbed and bleed out, she to choose to be a torturer rather than a victim)\n\n\"Yes well I'm playing one of the psychological sides, they're expecting to get fucked with y'know? And thanks to Jeffrey they're expecting to be made to feel helpless in the worst ways, I just make them feel helpless in some less worse ways. \nWhich leaves them with that big black cloud of paranoia hovering at the back of their minds.\" \n\n\"So then you know what your doing it's not just that your being a shit torturer that's really lucky...\" \nHe strokes his chin as he appears deep in thought for a moment before realizing I was still there. \n\n\"Well get back to it then.\"\n\nSo I did, I began my rounds again...\n\n**Part2?**\n",

I have an announcement.\" They calm only the slightest, but their noise volume does decrease. \"I have to let you know that there is only one 60\" television going to be available tonight at the $99 price point. The others that were supposed to be available were not received in our shipment.\"  The crowed surged forward with renewed screaming about ruining their Christmas. Chants of \"let us inside\"  resounded. I looked at the big clock on the wall, about to strike midnight, and pulled out my keys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where the magic happened last time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust as I turn my key in the door lock, the clock magically rolls back 20 minutes. With hellfire gleaming in my eyes, I give the crowd a devilish smile. \"Sorry folks,\" I explain, \"we can't open the doors until midnight. You'll have to wait just a liiitttttle bit longer.\" Shrugging my shoulders as if there is nothing I can do, I turn my back to the crowd and laugh.\n\nThis is going to be fun.",

            "comment": "The Knight of Endless Abyss stared down at the young man with fiery eyes shielded behind a blackened helmet. He stood atop the bodies of the young man\u2019s army, relishing in the agony his footsteps inflicted.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThis is your chance, your Highness, you\u2019re our final hope to end this wretched war,\u201d whispered the prince\u2019s advisor. The prince gulped.\r  \n\r  \nIt was only now that Prince Harold finally felt the full weight of his decision. Before, the guilt only slipped in now and again, usually around his late brother\u2019s birthday. It caught in his throat as he watched his mother\u2019s tears. But sometime during the parades and fanfare, it disappeared.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cPrince Theo, your sword.\u201d Another knight approached the prince and handed him his blade. It felt especially heavy in Harold\u2019s hand. The sword had been crafted many millennia ago to be wielded by the Called Upon. Harold had not been Called Upon.\r  \n\r  \nHe smiled weakly and raised the weapon.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cToday, we conquer darkness,\u201d he stated. \u201cWe conquer darkness and we free this country from the oppression of the Endless Abyss. Today, we fight for all of those whom we have lost. We fight for our fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, our sisters...and our brothers.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWhat remained of Harold\u2019s army cheered. Harold\u2019s advisor placed his hand on Harold\u2019s arm and squeezed it gently. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m sure Harold is watching over you right now.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHarold could only nod.\r  \n\r  \nTheo had always been the brave one. Though he was born only a few seconds before Harold, he had the spirit of an older brother. He was a protector, kind but stern. When he was Called Upon, the entire nation breathed a sigh of relief. The right twin had been chosen.\r  \n\r  \nHarold scowled at his quivering hands and shook his head. None of it mattered now. Theo was not here. Theo did not have the blood of thousands on his hands. He did not lie awake at night haunted by the gaunt faces of his dead comrades.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLet us ride!\u201d Harold shouted.\r  \n\r  \nThey charged onto the battlefield, the sound of hooves drowning out all else. The men howled and screamed as they drew their weapons. But the Army of the Endless Abyss was ready.\r  \n\r  \nHarold kept his eyes glued on the Knight. He could not waste a moment on the men dying all around him. Blood and dirt splattered across his armor and his ears rang with the sound of metal crashing against metal.\r  \nSuddenly he was flying through the air. Someone had caught their blade on his horse\u2019s legs and it collapsed forward, squealing in pain. Harold watched in horror as he descended into the chaos.\r  \n\r  \nWhen Harold awoke, his entire body felt like it was aflame. He turned his head to the right and saw his hand still gripping his sword. But his arm was farther away than he remembered. He turned to his left and gasped. The distorted face of a fallen knight stared back at him with unseeing eyes. \r  \n\r  \nInstinctively, he faced forward. The sky was clear and beautiful. It reminded him of spending time in the garden with his mother. Theo and him would play knight while their mother sipped tea, keeping a close eye on them both. Theo was stronger than Harold but he always let Harold win. Then they\u2019d rush to their mother\u2019s side for sandwiches. \r  \n\r  \nTears began to gather at the corners of Harold\u2019s eyes. How he missed those days. He tried to lift his right arm but couldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t bother trying his left. He looked down and saw both his legs intact. Pain shot through them as he moved.\r  \n\r  \nThen a large gloved hand grabbed him by his chest plate and lifted him into the air. It was the Knight of Endless Abyss. The Knight laughed at Harold\u2019s pitiful state. Harold looked down to see his right arm still lying on the battlefield.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cPlease,\u201d he wept. \u201cI am not the Called Upon. I am not Prince Theodore.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe Knight smirked and pulled the prince close. With one swift movement, he slid his sword underneath Harold\u2019s armor and through his chest. Blood spurted from Harold\u2019s mouth.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI know.\u201d",

            "comment": "The demon lord, the all conqueror, the king slayer, the monstrosity before me has been given many names throughout history, names spoken in every language, there wasn't a person alive who hadn't heard stories. But now, standing before me, this monstrosity that allegedly, used to call itself a man, glares down at me through a pitch black helmet, the glowing red irises seeming to fade into existence just behind the faceplate, the pitch black armor seeming to ooze a smog of death itself. I trembled in horror, the bloodlust radiating from this being, making me want to cry, vomit, and run, all at once, torn, my body seemed incapable of doing either, as I stared up at the beast, he was tall enough that act alone strained my neck.\n\nRegardless, I had to do *something* otherwise, my brothers legacy, would be lost once more, and the fault would, once more, lie squarely on my shoulders. Through the fear, a gripped tightly to the handle of my sword, blessed by the ancient ones, a holy weapon, the only thing that might lay this creature to rest, my brothers weapon.\n\nThe beast looked further down, it's eyes narrowing on the sword, glowing brighter still, almost as if enraged by its very existence.\n\nI raised the weapon. \"Well, c'mon, I don't have all day!\" I demanded. Despite my outward appearance, I was well aware this would likely be my last battle, the charade, would come to an end at last.\n\nThe monster lunged at me, our swords clashing, sparks dancing across the dirt as his men watched. I'd challenged him to a duel, despite being a monster, the legends told this beast was one of honor, I was glad to find they were right. We seemed equal in strength, despite my smaller stature, we stood deadlocked, neither able to overpower the other. \n\nQuickly, I jumped away, casting a bolt of fire from the tip of my blade. \"Incenimatus!\"\n\nWordlessly, the beast copied my attack, stopping it dead in its tracks, before rushing me once more. \n\nOur swords clashed yet again, but I was prepared this time. I sidestepped before the deadlock, bringing my sword low as his blade slid across the edge of my own, leaving a gash across his side as I lunged past him.\n\nThe beast staggered for just a moment, but that was enough for me to lunge at him once more, this time, aiming for his head. I put as much force as I could muster into my attack, a resounding 'clink!' Followed by the thud of his helmet, rang across the battlefield. I jumped back, preparing myself for retaliation, preparing to attack, though, what I saw next caused my eyes to go wide in horror, my sword falling to the ground, as I released my grip, my mouth agape, though no sound escaped. Before me stood a man with golden hair, glowing in the sun's radiant light, eyes like sapphires. \"B-brother?\" I felt as if I'd been punched in the gut. No, this isn't happening. This can't be real! \"Arthur! What the hell is this!? Is this some kind of joke!?\" I demanded. Once the shock of realization wore off, anger filled the void. How could my own brother, have become this monster?\n\nHe looked down at me, a devilish smirk on his face. \"Well hello, brother.\"",

                    "comment": "\nDriven by an insatiable hunger for chaos and destruction, this loathsome monster has vanquished armies with impunity. Their carcasses and bones lay bare before it\u2019s gaping maw. It cares not for the ideals or values of mortal realms; it exists only to sow the seeds of despair and bring forth the wails of despairing warriors.\n\nNone can deny the horror that radiates from this creature's presence. Its relentless assault strikes fear into the hearts of those who dare stand against it. The tales of its devastating deeds echo through the annals of history, a grim reminder of the consequences that arise when evil finds its physical form.\n\nMy mind was a storm of conflicting emotions. Fear mingled with an unwavering resolve, for I knew the odds were stacked against me. I hoped that even in the face of certain doom, my sacrifice might buy a sliver of time for the innocent to find safety.\n\nAs I approached the field of confrontation, the monster's presence cast a palpable shadow, blotting out the sun's feeble rays. The ground trembled beneath him, echoing the heartbeat of impending chaos. With every stride, my heart pounded in rhythm, resolute and unyielding.\n\nThe clash was imminent. I drew my gleaming sword, its blade whispered promises of valor and sacrifice. A battle cry erupted from my lips, piercing the silence and shattering the tension that hung heavy in the air. The monstrous creature, sensing the challenge, unleashed a deafening roar that shook the very foundations of courage.\n\nIn a flurry of violence, I and the monstrosity engaged in a dance of death, each blow struck with deadly precision. Our clash reverberated through the land, a symphony of clashing steel and monstrous roars. I fought valiantly, every strike a testament to a new unwavering spirit and unyielding bravery.\n\nBut alas, my strength waned, my body marked with wounds that oozed crimson. Fatigue weighed heavily upon me, and the realization of my impending doom settled like a heavy shroud. With one final, defiant stroke, I delivered a resounding blow, but the beast retaliated with a ferocity unmatched.\n\nAs I fell to the ground, my life force ebbing away, I gazed into the fiery eyes of the monstrosity. There, in that moment of profound sacrifice, I found solace, knowing that my death would serve a greater purpose. I whispered a prayer for the world I had fought so fiercely to protect, hoping that my sacrifice would inspire others to rise against the encroaching darkness.\n\nAnd so, my tale came to an end, my name forever etched in the annals of bravery. The monstrosity, though victorious, would forever bear the scars of that fateful encounter, the mark of a hero's valiant stand. The people, awestruck by my unwavering spirit, would tell tales of my sacrifice for generations to come, ensuring that my legacy would endure, a beacon of hope even in the face of unimaginable horrors.",

            "comment": "As I stood at the gates of the ominous fortress, I felt a feeling that I haven't felt in 6 years. The same overwhelming deep pressure in my chest, the same cold that swept over me when my brother was killed right in front of me, mauled by this vile madman in a tattered cloak with a sword. I remember how I retraced his steps to the only church in town, how the pastor was just raving on about nonsensical things such as \"I had such faith in him when I told him the truth of what he was destined to be\" and \"now we are all truly doomed against the encroaching darkness\", but not a single damn word about what I lost that day. Ever since then I've been told by all sorts of characters about his apparent journeys he's taken since he was age 13, how he displayed great supernatural power and how he was destined to do great things.\nI didn't want to hear it. If these people knew all this and would have got off their sorry, lazy asses to do something for themselves, then maybe my brother wouldn't have died when he was 19 and could have had the normal life he deserved.\n\nThey told me I was insane. That what I wanted to do was impossible. I told them I didn't give a f**k. That I'm going to finish what he started, and give no quarter to what lurks in the shadows. Using the same tool the madman did when he killed the only family I knew, and the familyI tracked many sorts of evil creatures, zombies, evil warlocks, orcs, soldiers, experiments and possessed folk from the next town over... Apparently, they called me the Hunter, the vengeful spectre of of my brother... Others called me by his name, saying I had been corrupted and risen from the grave...\nThey can think what they want.\nI was forced out of my mental reverie of sorts by dreadful howls... Werewolves, protectors of the dark fortress.\nAs two of them assailed me, I did my damndest to block their blows, and struck against them. I was always told you have to have a silver cross to kill werewolves, but I didn't care. Werewolves look up to the biggest, strongest one in the pack. All you have to do is rough them up a little... And they'll scamper right off.\nAs I let my anger get control, a sense of blur and instinct took over my vision. As I yelled with the strength and resolve of greater men, I directed a flurry of crushing blows towards the creature of the night, brutally caving it's jaw in until I heard it crack, then, with a final yell, I gouged out it's eyes and cleaved the head from the body.\nThe other one quickly ran after this. \nAs I opened the doors to the final battle, I felt my hands shake with pure rage.\nThe same man that haunted my dreams, the figure everyone claimed commanded the forces of the night that took everything away stood in front of me, and started to bellow about how good can never vanquish evil, or something. I wasn't having any of it, before I realized what I had done, I blindly tackled the man, and had him in a chokehold. \n\"Such brutality. Such lack of honor. Such hatred for your fellow man. You truly believe YOU are the hero? This is proof that the ways of darkness are better. Look how much you've given in to corruption... You were once such a loving, passionate child...\"\nI spoke the final words he would ever hear. \n\"I'm here to avenge my brother, you piece of shit. I was always miserable, and you made sure I would stay that way when you took his life...\"\nImpossible, he said. That he meant to kill the hero's brother that night, not the hero.\nI took out the dagger made by my father that my brother gave to me for protection the night before he died, and brutally stabbed the pitiful man, before I killed him the same way he murdered my brother.",

            "comment": "Alion stood, white as a sheet as he faced down Emperor Gilder himself, his heart pounding in his chest while skipping beats. There was a simple answer for what he felt, afraid, Alion was nothing but afraid. All this time he thought things would get better, that he could find some method, some stratagem to work through the problem, to get past all of this without needing the real hero. After all, that's why he fought, Alion wanted to make his brother proud, but he couldn't do that without taking on his name, Felix, nobody would have believed in him otherwise.\n\nAfter what felt like ages of staring, Alion finally gained the courage to blink, which was just enough input to realize that nothing has moved for a bit too long. The crackling flames of the Braziers next to Gilder's throne were still, and the sounds of battle ceased. Alion would have normally been happy, but he knew that only the sage of millennia could be the one to do this. He turned around, where the sage always waited, swallowing hard in a vain attempt to regain composure.\n\n\"H-hi-i-i...\" He choked as he looked at the sage.\n\nThe sage was a kind black woman who wore a sympathetic smile even now. Like all sages she wore elegant attire, a white dress with cogs and clock hands embroidered on it in silver, and a laced braid in her hair. She patiently waited for Alion to articulate, gesturing for him to go on.\n\n\"I-i-i, I CAN'T DO THIS!!!\" Alion finally broke down, letting out the first sob he had in years, collapsing to his knees, \"I'm not your hero! I'm not in the prophecy at all! I'm just a sham, a sham who got lucky! You all helped me to the finish line and I don't have what it takes to cross.\"\n\nHe continued to sob, tears rolling down his cheeks as he tried to wipe them away, which only make his face turn red. He continued stammering, trying to find more words to convey how he felt, how helpless he was, but even in that regard he felt like he was drowning. The weight of the situation had fully crashed onto him, and he couldn't bear it. As his mind raced, he felt a hand on the top of his head, and as he looked up he saw the sage had knelt beside him, still giving him that same smile.\n\n\"Why aren't you speaking!? I'm fake! I lied to you, to everyone! Now we'll... We'll...\" He couldn't muster the last word, as though speaking it aloud would solidify the fate he led everyone into.\n\n\"You didn't lie about anything, you just need a moment. The pressure that forms a diamond will wilt a rose, so breathe, decompress, little flower.\" She spoke softly, as she gently pulled Alion into a hug, \"The emperor is a daunting foe, but you aren't alone. The prophecy said that the man called Felix would fell the emperor with the help of his closest allies, you aren't alone.\"\n\nAlion sobbed again, beginning to hyperventilate as he looked away from the sage in shame, his sword finally clattering to the ground. Some hero he was, lying to befriend people, lying to be given a magical sword of legend, even now a sage in control of time is consoling him because he lied to her.\n\n\"I. AM. Not...\" He forced himself to look at her, his expression desperate and sorrowful, \"I'm not Felix, my brother is. I'm his little brother, I'm just me, Alion Carver. I'm not the hero you wanted, I-\"\n\nHe was cut off by the sage laughing, something he hadn't heard before. She had always been so motherly, so humorless, but so very caring, and now she was laughing as though he had told the best joke ever. Alion was bewildered, to say the least, so much so that he couldn't even sob, couldn't even get angry as he watched one of the most powerful people he has ever met laugh.\n\n\"Well, Felix- Alion. I don't see why that disqualifies you from being the hero.\" She booped him on the nose, standing up and gesturing to their surroundings, \"A man called Felix will rise, bringing together those trodden upon and oppressed, those desperate and depressed, the worst of the worst, and the best of the best.\"\n\n\"Alion, you fulfilled the prophecy at every turn. You were so obsessed with defying things so you could succeed that you stumbled right back into being the person we needed most. You are the man called Felix, you took the name to trick us, but you were the man all along, you just didn't know it. So tell me, I know for a fact that you are the hero of prophecy, so what are you?\"\n\nAlion was entirely blown away by this line of thinking, a man called Felix, called, not named, not just Felix, a man called Felix. By this logic, any number of people could have taken up the mantle, it was just a matter of the right one. Like a line of dominoes, everything began to make sense, Alion's eyes lighting up with every revelation.\n\nAfter the prophecy was made the name Felix became incredibly common, after the prophecy was taken seriously everybody had to change their name from Felix. Alion's brother was never the hero of prophecy, he was just a plain old hero, one who inspired him to take up the mantle. Alion had defied every instinct of his to run, all to finish what his brother had started, and with that Alion knew exactly what he needed to do.\n\n\"I'm a hero, I'm a knight. I am Alion Carver, the Hero called Felix.\" As soon as he said this, the Sage smiled as his vision began to melt, returning to him staring at Emperor Gilder, but this time was different, as the flames crackled Alion smiled and raised his sword, roaring.\n\n\"Who's ready for some Karmic Justice!?\" He brandished his sword as his allies roared their agreement, dozens of the bravest men and women at his side as they all geared up to fight a man who thinks himself god. With one final breath, Alion leapt forward, towards his destiny.",

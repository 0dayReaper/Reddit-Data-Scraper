            "comment": "who would have thought that something so simple could destroy everything we know?\n\nEveryone who has a name in physics, mathematics or computerscience was here and of course the leaders of every country on our earth.\n\n\u201eIt is of great essence that we come to a conclusion today! We have found something\u2026 well new and incredible powerful\u201c : Dr Quantinger explained. he had no clue why he was chosen to deliver this speech. He wasn\u2018t involved in any of these new findings. Normally that would mean he had to study the puplished papers for days to understand the complex experiments necessary for new findings in physics. But not this time. This experiment was unbelievably simple. EVERYBODY could do it and that was the problem.\n\n\u201eI am not explaining how any of this works just that everybody in this room could build it with things they can find in a local home improvement store. Thats why we propose this radical and total solution: Banning all use of modern technology, suspending any research and\u2026\u201c he stopped the last part was the big problem. Without these technologies we will lose so much what we built. Planes, cars, computers, telecommunications and space travel. Nothing would be possible without electronics.\n\n\u201e\u2026 the destruction of every electric technology and knowledge of it.\u201c\n\nA loud protest ruptured through the conference hall of the united nations here in new york.\n\nIt was a miracle that this experiment hasn\u2019t been done before in the century electrinics are available but everything has to end\u2026\n\nSomewhere in a electronics laboratory a student named Sam did the unthinkable. And with the connection of four diodes to build a graetz-rectifier which he build wrong this little planet near a type G star erupted with light. As ever electron on this planet jumped from a higher energy level and straight back down and up again, releasing photons in every direction excitinng neighbouring electrons and so on.\n\nSo the last thing we all saw was the warm embrace of the light.",

            "comment": "The concept was blindingly simple, so simple that any idiot could stumble upon it.\n\nAll one needed was two radios and two microphones. Feedback wasn't something unusual, hell, anyone who went to a concert had an opportunity to experience it, but it was generally high.\n\nBut, with the right modulation, the correct distance apart, what scientists were calling 'The Death Note' could be created. It was such a low frequency that hardly anyone could hear it, but it had a kind of resonance that drove people to violent insanity if exposed long enough.\n\nIt had been discovered by accident a partially deaf science teacher had been teaching his students about audio frequencies and feedback, inviting them to suggest different settings and had them write down what they thought would happen.\n\nThe entire school was a bloodbath, nobody understood what happened, and for a solid month, nobody ever looked closer, except a detective who was looking through evidence gathered, like the radios and the notebooks. The classroom had been the epicenter of the carnage, he was certain of that, so alone in his office, he fucked around with the radios.\n\nThe next morning, he was found ferally violent, incapable of speech, eyes wild and hateful, like his sense of who he was had vanished. He was sedated, put into a cell, and eventually moved to a secure facility.\n\nThe evidence he'd messed around with was sent as well, for chemical analysis.\n\nThis was when the tone was first recorded, and subsequently destroyed.\n\nNobody knew about the Death Note yet, nobody except the world's leading scientists. There was no cure for the violence, no therapy that could undo the damage. But it was a consistent degradation.\n\n\"Members of the United Nations Council... We have access to a weapon that could destroy all of humanity.\" Dr. Reiner stated. \"Please observe the following, and please understand we've had to alter the sound a little for everyone's protection.\"\n\nA video of the tone being played for a man in an otherwise soundproof room showed the slow, gradual process by which he slowly, yet steadily showed a decline in higher reasoning, until he simply laid down on the ground and stopped breathing.\n\n\"This tone not only destroys higher reasoning, but will slowly kill anyone who hears it. We are one major fuckup away from extinction. Our proposal is thus, and it pains us to even suggest it.\"\n\nDr. Reiner looked at everyone. \"Our only option is to revert society back to non-electrical technology.\"\n\nThe council was in an uproar, of course. What was being suggested was insanity, but every option had been weighed, every argument countered. There was nothing that could be done.\n\nUltimately, they couldn't convince the council to agree.\n\nThe first Death Note Bomb was deployed not even a month after in New York City, those lucky- or unlucky- few who managed to get out of range suffered mental degradation, but were otherwise capable of rational thought, showing a fear of technology that forced them to flee from modern society. The slightly larger group that poured through the streets attacked those who didn't know the threat.\n\n7 million people died, a mere statistic for the scientists who knew there was no other way. The bombings continued, disrupting society, forcing people to flee from anywhere technological, for fear that their homes would become a death trap.\n\nWithin months, the United States had been rendered largely uninhabitable.\n\nThat was when something peculiar happened. Small villages began to spring up, some of them simply the result of members of the Society of Creative Anachronism and medieval nerds banding together to stay clothed, fed, and sheltered, those affected by the tone joining in, embracing the new lifestyle, working to convince their sane contemporaries to listen to the tone and  forget the world that came before.\n\nSome were exiled, deemed too serious a threat to keep, some were embraced, the tone listened to long enough to match their insanity.\n\nThe world watched this societal regression with horror, some began the process of unmodernizing, hearkening back to more traditional methods of existence, some trying to blend modern sensibilities with ancient practice, some embracing long forgotten pasts and gods.\n\nOthers fought against this, and were targeted, decimated, forced to flee and assimilate into other cultures, or die.\n\nIn one of few labs standing, a group of scientists observed this with grim acceptance, they raised their drinks in one last cheers, and drank the poisoned alcohol without hesitation.",

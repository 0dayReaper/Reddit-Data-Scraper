            "comment": "\"what do you mean? This was heaven, now you have to go back.\"\n\nAs I look back upon my life. All the pain and suffering I have felt throughout. All seemed to ever be expanded from what had happened.\n\nThe lost of my wife and future child had made it all seem like hell.\n\n\"This can't be heaven.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Said the black robed figure, now standing above me with a large shiny silver sickle.\n\n\"All the pain...\"\n\n\"Sheesh, everyone always mentions the pain and suffering they never realize that without the pain, there wouldn't have been joy, happiness, or any positive emotions....\n\nSuddenly before the figure finishes, he is suddenly drawn back into his senses and begins to tear up as he remembers all the good things of life. His friends and the adventures they had, as well as family that had been right by him when he needed it. Ever more memories begin to flow through him as he states...\n\n\"Now that I know... Can I stay...?\"\n\nA simple \"no\" echoed from the figure.\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nAs one more tear falls and the figure plunges his blade into my chest. I feel my still warm body go cold and I drift off into nothingness...\n\nSuddenly I opened my eyes and felt nothing as I looked around to see roads of gold and white marble extending to a golden palace... With all his memories of his time in heaven. He realizes that it's hell not because it's painful, fiery and dark, but because there's no emotions in this perfect paradise.",

            "comment": "\rIt hadn\u2019t been done before. People said that it was an impossible goal. My friend claimed that YouTube caps the count at 99.9% to push driven people like me into a hopeless grind for 100%. Well, I chose to remain optimistic. YouTube had announced a majestic award for the first community to achieve it, and I badly wanted it. \r  \n\r  \nI checked the viewer stats and just as I had expected, the ratio of viewer to new subscriber still lingered at 0.99. Every one of my videos was stuck in that swamp. As the world\u2019s biggest youtuber, I couldn\u2019t just let myself be defeated by my now-nemesis, Bob. \r  \n\r  \nI had known Bob for years now, since my days as a Minecraft channel. Before he became \u201cBobTheGamer\u201d, I knew him as \u201cx\\_X\\_Gamer360Xx\u201d when we met. His positive comments were the push I needed to work harder. Even when I felt like giving up and made a video about it, he messaged me directly imploring me to reconsider. His sayings like \u201cGreat things take great time\u201d and \u201cYou can do it\u201d cheered me up.  \r  \n\r  \nOn that day, I swore to him that I was going to make him proud. It was all for him. I worked extremely hard to find video ideas no one had ever thought of before and make them fun. Record after record, I soared to the top steadily. Yet, I felt him being proud of me was just getting impossible. Videos and projects I had put all my energy and life into only earned neutral remarks of \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d or \u201cnot bad\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nMy messages to him were never answered. When I made a public video thanking him and offering him a huge reward, he sent me his address and never said a word after that. What\u2019s more, I found out recently that he had left behind a long trail of comments and likes and replies, but he had never subscribed. 99.9%..that number haunted me in every video, because of him.\r  \n\r  \nBefore my newest video, I messaged him, \u201cHey Bob. Long time no see.\u201d\r  \nNo reply as usual. I continued, \u201cI noticed that you haven\u2019t subscribed! You know\u2026you\u2019re the only one left. I can hit a 100% viewer to subscriber count, Bob. We can make history.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHey Max\u201d, he replied. I was shocked at his sudden energy and waited.\r  \nHe said, \u201cI can\u2019t do that. Not now, not yet. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\u201d and went offline abruptly.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHey! You can\u2019t just ghost me like that! What\u2019d you mean\u2026\u201dnot now\u201d??\u201d, I replied back quickly. \r  \n\r  \nHe never replied back. Livid, I set out to make the next video. A short update video which began with me calling him out for blocking an important milestone for my community. \u201cBob, please, please just sub. You are the only one left!\u201d, I begged openly, \u201ctell me why you won\u2019t do this!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nFrom my previous videos thanking him, Bob had become a much beloved figure in the community. Every comment of his had numerous replies praising his character and actions. After this video, they all were in disarray. They questioned Bob\u2019s motivations and crafted theories for them. Some claimed that he was an \u201chonorary subscriber\u201d for all the things he had done. \u201cBut what about his silence now? This could be big!\u201d, others questioned. \r  \n\r  \nDrama channels had already begun to report this new revelation. #SubscribeBob had become trending on Twitter with numerous pleas and requests to help attain the \u201cunachievable\u201d goal. I watched the reactions with keen interest as Bob had to reply now. Subreddits had opened up to post every comment on my video to capture Bob at the earliest. \r  \n\r  \nHours later, the white whale emerged while I was asleep. Bob said nothing more than, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t subscribe now. You\u2019re not good enough yet.\ud83d\ude05 You can do this\ud83e\udd17\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cNot good enough\u201d? The fastest growing youtuber! Highest subscriber count! Most watched content creator! Millions of subscribers, enough to outnumber hundreds of countries! Unbeatable records like this, and I\u2019m still not good enough for him? \r  \n\r  \nI was furious and began to tear up knowing that I was still not good enough for him. Even before I had woken up to read it, his comment had been stabbed and harpooned heavily. People were frustrated and disappointed that their idol was this twisted man forcing his friend to meet some impossible ideal. \r  \n\r  \nWith the anger still fresh, I started recording my next video, a response to him. It wouldn\u2019t be long, but it was sure to make an impact.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBob\u201d, I said weakly, \u201cI read your comment. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t meet your ideals. Frankly, I think no one can, not even you! You just want me to keep making stuff even if it kills me, just to suit your \u201cvision\u201d. I wanted to make you proud but now..? I\u2019m done, Bob, done. I\u2019m just\u2026just sick of you. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do this but there\u2019s no other way. 14 Kellnerstrasse, Berlin. Your home. You should have subscribed, Bob. You should have. At least now, I hope you\u2019re proud of what I\u2019ve created.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nOnce I had hit the upload button, I sat and waited for the greatest miracle on earth. This will take time.",

User Meercat56 crowned Bob VlogFriends\u2019 most prodigious viewer of all time, as Mr.Bob kept coming up with the most irreverent witticisms ever to set foot on this YouTube channel. Since this morning Mr.Bob had watched video after video after video while spewing out -just- THE most nonsensical utter gibberish. It was all to the hilarity of his captive audience.\n\n  \n   \u201cThose flowers were just terrible\u201d or \u201cI ate the plastic macaroni lego\u201d. His off hand comments never made much sense, but the rest of the user-base, the vlogger included, just could NOT get enough of it!\n\n  \n   The real Bob, the Bob behind the screen, could NEVER have lived up to their high expectations of him. He moved his hairy paws across the dusty aged keyboard without any thought in his mind while the auto-play went to next video and the dying computer\u2019s auto-correct made sense of the letters \u201cAIFNOWFNJWQNR\u201d into \u201cAnd I hope you too have a very nice spaghetti my friend\u201d.\n\n  \n   His owner came home at 6.33 to discover the comical situation. \u201cSay, I\u2019m home Bobby boy. Think it\u2019s time for some Bolognese for me and some nice cat food for you. Sounds delicious, huh Bob?\u201d\n\n  \n   Bob just finished typing out his last and final comment, \u201cWho let the dogs out? Woof Woof Woof Woof!\u201d as his owner unplugged the computer and bob went to curl up into a ball a step away on the desk chair. Bob was still not subscribed to VlogFriends, and never would be.",

            "comment": "I sometimes feel dead. Not really dead, no. More like a stone, a heavy dense piece of rock, and I sink deeper and deeper in the ocean and ignore its flow. And then often when I wake up, I realize I've hit the bottom and the sand has encrusted me. It's a terrible feeling, a sort of unease as I go through my days. And it started two years ago. I never really lacked for much. A normal family, middle class dad working at the docks as a manager; a stay at home mom; white picket fences and short cropped grass with a Labrador named Chuckles. The works... I studied in Boston, majored in Biology. Went on to work in MedCorp, a simple researcher. And yet, every time I tried to remember those days, the memories were hazy; incomplete. As if someone else was steering the wheel, and I was just an observer through his eyes. I hadn't kept in touch with anyone, and it all felt fake. \n\nFake. Fake. Fake.\n\nI was fake, and everyone else felt fake too. My limbs didn't feel the right length, and every time I looked at myself in the mirror I expected \u2014 vaguely \u2014 to see other features. Like for example, my face wasn't angular enough, my features not quite sharp, and my nose a bit thinner than it should have been. Dr. Black said it was mild Body Dysphoria. A mental condition, that makes a person fill uncomfortable in their own skin. I trusted her, but at the same time it didn't quite fit. \n\nIt never did. \n\nA hand on my shoulder made me twitch, \"James you're brooding again.\"\n\nI turned around to look at Anne, round big blue eyes and brown wavy hair framing her concerned features. There was a sort of worry there, along with amusement. She was often stoic, cold, but you could discern things from the way the corners of her mouth twitched in amusement, or her nose would crinkle when she was stressed. Anne wasn't conventionally attractive. Limbs slightly out of proportion, skinny and pale. The sort of person you'd call gangly as a teenager. But she had grown into her frame. Long legs and exceedingly tall, a tad too introverted. I liked her. She was a friend, as much as I could call anyone a friend these days. \n\nI rubbed my face and blinked the tears out of my eyes, \"Why are you still here?\" I asked her. It was already dark outside, and most of the lab was empty but for the few zealous or lonely enough to stay through Christmas. Heads up: 'I don't give a shit about the lab.' \n\nAnne rolled her eyes and heft her bag on her shoulder, \"I'm going now, wanted to let you know that I included you on the CC for Johnson's paper. Apparently he made some *breakthrough*, and he wants us to give it a look. Also, don't start adding shit this time, because he never adds people the credit whore he is. \" she scoffed. \n\nI gave her a small smile and nodded, \"That's fine, merry Christmas, yeah?\"\n\nShe didn't turn around but gave me a wave and walked out. I sat there for a few moments, and then turned around to keep writing. \n\nBy the time I got out it was already night time, I was exhausted and the air outside gave me a bit of a kick. Cold and dry, a sort of biting in the bones that made me want to run back in the lab and just sleep on the floor or something. The streets were empty, and I decided to just walk home, it was only a few blocks away and I convinced myself that a bit of exercise wouldn't hurt. Even though I was as thin as a stick, and never seemed to put on pounds. \n\n-00-00-00-\n\nSee sometimes, random decisions create situations that are plain annoying. For example I only made it a block away before some schmuck shoved a gun in my face and asked for my wallet. I've never really been in a situation like this, but it felt trifle. Insignificant even. This wasn't art. See, a real artist would have shot at the knee, pulled me into the alley and then pull out a knife. Slice every time I whimpered or plead for help or even mercy. \n\nA real artist would have extracted every ounce of fear, maybe even given me a shred of hope that I would live or something. And then at grand finale he'd show me that there was no hope all along and just end me. \n\nYes. \n\nYes. That would me *amazing*, *wonderful, exhilarating*! Why was this insignificant fucking moron yelling at me? Did he know who I was? I was... \n\nWho was I? Where did these thoughts come from? James? I was James, right? Normal family, normal... I was normal, and if I didn't give the man my wallet I might die. Right?\n\nNo. No. No, I wasn't going to die, I wasn't. I was special, unique, uncontrollable. A mountain. The obstacle that others had to clear for success. \n\nAs if I was floating outside of my body, I watched as someone else \u2014 *who was me*\u2014 slapped the gun away and pushed the man in the alley. I watched as someone else's bones jumped out of *his* body and pierced the man in the shoulders. And I felt that glorious pain, the bones grinding and chipping against one another and the smell of fear and adrenaline forced me to do more. \n\nMore. More. More! \n\nI wanted to harm him, break him. I wanted him to feel sadness, and joy, and a million million things. This random man who I didn't know and never would. Yes. By the time I was done with him, he and I would be the most intimate couple of people on earth. \n\nHe would die, and I would live. \n\n-00-00-00-\n\nMy cellphone's ringing woke me up. The nightmare was so surreal, and my clothes clung on me, wet and cold with sweat. I was confused for a few moments, moments that stretched as the phone kept ringing. Annoyed at the sound, I picked it up and Anne's crisp voice echoed, \"James are you alright? I've been trying to reach you for a few hours now, I almost called the police!\"\n\n\"What? Anne, calm down. What happened?\"\n\n\"You don't know?\" she asked, an incredulous tone that I didn't exactly appreciate.\n\nI sighed. An irritated breath that she heard but didn't comment on, \"No, I don't. I just woke up\"\n\n\"Oh, oh. Ok then, it's just... There was an attack near the lab yesterday. There was some bone and a corpse... People are saying that Bonesaw is back.\" She finished with a whisper. My gut clenched at the name. Bonesaw, a man who used to terrorize entire cities, killed thousands. I should have been horrified, but all I could muster was longing, a nostalgia that didn't really quite fit in the context. \n\nI sat there for a few moments, getting my thoughts in order, \"I, ugh, I'm fine Anne. Thanks for worrying, but I have a massive hangover right now; do you want to get some coffee later?\"\n\n\"Sure, the usual place?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nWe chatted for a bit longer, and then I rushed to the toilet and practically hurled my guts out. I had some OJ and toast for breakfast that didn't really help and then I brought up the daily news on my tablet. There wasn't much on the attack, but I googled Marquis. The name felt right somehow, it felt as if I knew the man his entire life. Then I saw the pictures, and froze. \n\nI froze because the man reminded me of what I was supposed to look like. Pale skin, and regal features, hidden by a mask made out of bone that only covered the forehead and eyes. Then the memories from last night hit me like a freight train, and I rushed to the toilet and hurled again, panting over the now murky water. I lifted my finger and forced... Forced something, and bone extruded, my skin bleeding a little as it did. \n\nI was a mutant, I had always been. Laughter bubbled up in my chest and I let it rise louder and louder as I stared at the bone. \n\nThen I felt it before I noticed the foot that met my skull. A woman standing behind me, probably some teleporter or something but it was the hair that clinched it. Anne grabbed my head and slammed it on the toilet seat, all the while my laughter didn't stop and I felt no desire to do so. \n\nShe injected some sort of needle in my arm and I instantly felt weak, my bone crumbled away in dust and I lost control of my body. She turned me around and looked at me with pity. Pity! \n\nI wanted to explode, rage, kill. I wanted her on her knees begging for forgiveness, I...\n\n\"Mutant XO114-M7, due to the failure of rehabilitation method thirteen you have been declared unsuccessful and are hereby declared as recipient of kill order code named 'Firefly', \" she pulled a gun and aimed right at my skull, \"may your soul rest in piece, you piece of...\" A gunshot rung and I closed my eyes, ready to accept the inevitable. \n\nI blinked for a few seconds, and I was covered in blood and gray matter, Anne slowly toppled sideways and behind her stood a boy no older than fifteen, a huge smile on his face, \"Uncle James! I never expected to see you again.\"\n\n\nEDIT: Marquis is actually a villain in the Web Novel, Worm by Wildbow. Although a relatively minor one that I thought would make a basis for this snippet. Thanks for reading!",

            "comment": "I remember the day that I found out who I was.\n\nI had thought that I was Curtis Clark, a 37 year-old pediatric dentist in San Antonio. And, for a time, that is who I was. I had also had memories of a time before that: memories of growing up, of having friends in high school, of struggling to get my degree and opening my practice, of a few forgotten flings I had along the way. It seemed like nothing out of the ordinary, I thought I had been nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nBut I had been wrong.\n\nI remember one day a little girl--7, I think--came in. She had lost quite a few teeth for her age already, and thinking that this was a sign of growing up, I had had the gall to congratulate her. But this only put tears in her eyes. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me how she had lost some of her teeth. I can\u2019t say that I was really all that said for her, though. That wasn\u2019t the primary emotion that I felt. Instead, it was anger. I was angry at her parents, at her father, so angry, everything began to take on a tinge of crimson.\n\nIt took so much patience to finish working on her, and when the mom came in, to avoid stabbing the her with dental tools as punishment for standing by while this had happened to her daughter.\n\nI thought back, and I couldn\u2019t ever remember being that angry, yet I had felt, for some reason, that the feeling was familiar.\n\nI remember taking the rest of the day off, and calling CPS. But from what the agent said, and some intuition that I had not known about until then, I had no illusions that they would take any timely action to save that little girl. If only one of the superheroes would take an interest in such things, but they seem only to care about Big Name Villains--never heard of one who goes after petty criminals and domestic disputes.\n\nI then spent the rest of the day wondering about myself. I thought about this angry side that I had just found within myself. It didn\u2019t seem like that was something that I had ever experienced with myself. Yet, it had felt so natural.\n\nI remember thinking things at that time, that from that point onwards, I could not get out of my head. Thoughts of rage and fury, and some sort of knowledge of how to execute them. Plans to incinerate government buildings filled with inept pension-hungry drones found their way into my head. Thoughts on suffocating and choking greedy and heartless executives in their cushy offices with toxic gas. Plans to protect myself, my thoughts, from...something.\n\nI remember the day that I found out who I was. I was reading the online paper. The frontpage story was about Captain Stupendous, the superhero. He had apparently eradicated his 100th villain--though, because of the way he did his work, no one actually remembered them all. How long had he been active, something approaching 20 years, and he only manages 100 villains? I could find that many in a week, I thought. I was wondering just how it was that these 100 were so *important*, so *heinous*, as to merit his personal attention, and thus I looked back on the past articles the newspaper had. He seemed to only average about one feat every 2 months.\n\nI remember the exact moment that I saw...me. Most papers blurred out the faces of villains--at Stupendous\u2019s request, so that he could actually try \u2018giving them a new shot at life\u2019 or whatever his thing was. Wiping their memories had seemed inhuman to me at the time, and dishonest, but he was of the line of thought that it was preferable to killing them, and that they would do better next time. There were, though, some tabloids that tried to skirt this with less than complete obfuscation, and it is in one of those that I saw what I suddenly recognized to be...me. \n\nThe figure in the article, unlike many other villains, had refrained from being grandiose, and had only called himself Dr. C. No stupid made-up stage name, no Doctor Doom or High Lord of Paine--and no wearing weird suits like the latter either. They had to make up the name Dr. Cruel for him, but he never acknowledged it. The article called him the most terrifying, because he struck without first gloating, without giving explanation, and without mercy. It resonated with every fiber of my being, and in that moment, I felt whole, complete, and completely dedicated to a new calling--or rather, rededicated to an old one.\n\nI remember Dr. C. I am Dr. C. I am an oncologist for society, for it has been stricken with a cancer that I must eliminate. The so-called heros do not care for the calls of the everyday villains of the world, they do not care for the real villains of the world, only their flamboyant stage partners. That burden falls to me, and I remember now how to embrace it. I remember the righteous fire that drove me.\n\nI look back at my patient records. That father lives in a suburb a few miles away. He feels the need to hurt his daughter when he feels the burn of alcohol down his throat. I wonder if he will feel the same if he feels real fire. If I remember correctly, most don\u2019t. And now, now I do remember.",

            "comment": "Maria fumbled for the keys in her bag, eventually finding the heart shaped keyring her husband had given to her long ago. How long exactly, she couldn't quite remember.\n\nThe lock clicked. A monotonous buzzing greeted her, as if a giant hornet had taken up residence in their home since she'd left for work. \"Honey?\" she called out. \"Are you okay?\" \n\nNo reply.\n\nShe stepped into the lounge and was met by an unpleasent, smoky smell. The buzzing had intensified too. It was a sound she now recognised, but hadn't heard for a long, long time. \n\nAn electric razor.\n\nMaria frowned, a little annoyed that Peter was likely removing his thick, flowing beard. There was something she loved dearly about it -- the white hairs that shot through the blond reminded her of sunlight bouncing gleefully off an icy waterfall. It suited a physicist. It suited *him*.\n\n*buzzzz*\n\nThe living room table was a mess of cigarettes and empty beer bottles -- Peter had clearly enjoyed his day off. A folded page of a newspaper wafted up and down in the gentle breeze from an open window.\n\n*buzzz*\n\nMaria moved idly to the table, picking up first the cigarette remains, then dropping them on the carpet as the face in the paper stared up at her, her husband's keen eyes meeting her own. His face was clean shaven, and his wrinkles softened -- but there was no mistaking him.\n\nHer hands shook as she picked it up and read.\n\n&gt; Master Particle. Prior to Reworking's alterations. Considered the greatest physicist of his generation. But another talent wasted by the great 'hero'. This paper says Reworking is not the answer! We're the only paper brave enough to print a picture like this and...\n\nShe stopped reading. Something was wrong: there was no sound.\n\n \"Welcome home, *Maria*.\"\n\n Maria gulped as she turned to see the man in the paper standing behind her. \n\n\"Sweetheart...\"\n\n \"Is it really Maria? No, of course it isn't. It doesn't matter now though.\"\n\n \"I didn't ...\"\n\n \"I was great, you know. The greatest, they say. I could have changed the world. Now I teach school children basic astrophysics. The order of the planets -- and they can't even get that right without a pathetic mnemonic to aid them. My life -- or at least many years of it -- has been wasted. Can you imagine if they'd lobotomised a young Eistein? Where would we be?\"\n\nHe slowly removed a knife from his jacket pocket.\n\n \"*Please.*\"\n\n \"How long until you were done spying on me, *darling*? Until you left me! I loved you *so* much. In my mind, you loved me, too. But only in my mind! It's all a Goddamned lie! You'll pay for that deceit, I promise you.\"\n\n \"Please, Peter. In my mind, I love you too. *I do!* I don't know what's happened. I don't understand any of this.\"\n\nHe grinned as he stalked forward. \"Oh, *you know*. You're here to watch over me. To report back to them each day, when I think you're working, so you can all laugh at me. *Mock me.* The great, *impotent*, Master Particle.\"  \n\n *\"I always loved y...\" *\n\nThe knife was sharp and cut her throat cleanly and easily. She didn't scream as her blood spattered the carpet. \n\nMaria's body fell next to the fallen cigarette remains. \n\n\n---\n\nIt was an hour later, as Peter drank greedily from a clear bottle, his boots resting on his dead wife's carcass, that a gust from the open window turned the newspaper's page.\n\nPeter leaned forward, his eyes wide. He snatched the paper up. He read silently twice over, then mumbled a litany of *no's*. Finally, he swore bloody revenge on the world itself. \n\nHe looked down at his wife through bleary eyes, scalding tears spilling down his cheeks. How could this have happened? His life had been perfect -- *twice!* Now he could never go back... *could he*?\n\nHe knelt over Maria and gently pressed his trembling lips against her forehead.\n\nPeter could feel his mind buzzing; could see the sparks leaping from his hands. He felt in tune with the universe's tempestuous vibrations, and he knew in that moment, exactly what he was capable of:\n\n*The end of everything.*\n\nPeter got to his feet and looked at the paper a final time.\n\n&gt; At least they had the decency to erase his wife's -- his assistant Scarlett (pictured above) -- mind, and to keep them together in their new lives. But this paper, this reporter, says it's not enough! It's time to end Reworking.\n\n\n\n---\n\nPart two: https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/7n3dix/master_particle_part_two/\n\n",

You could have him looking through other newspapers, as he rests his legs on his wife, to find out more about his past and that's when he finds out he had a wife. Maybe she could've been caught before him and that helped lead to his capture as he tried to save her.\n\nOther than that, the tragedy of someone (wrongfully) killing a perceived traitor is always a favorite of mine. You also have a pretty good way with words, unlike myself who can't figure out how to phrase that better, and make a compelling story.",

I flinched away, scowling. He needed contact to wipe my memories. \n\n\"You're a fucked up person, you know that?\" I said. \"What kind of sicko wipes someone's memories and then takes advantage of them!\" I shook my head. \"When I woke up in that bed, alone, confused, not remembering anything - you were there, but...\" \n\n\"It was either that or kill you, Liz, and I couldn't have bared to kill you,\" he said, his eyes were watery and he sounded sincere, but he had looked sincere when I'd woken up without memories, and he'd been holding my hand. \"Even if I knew this would happen...\" he said and sighed. \n\nI gave a short bark of laughter. \"No, I'm pretty sure you didn't, Rob,\" I said. \"Pretty sure you wanted to keep me ignorant of my past forever, and have me be your lovely little wife till the end of time.\"\n\nRobert shook his head. \"No...I knew how you would react if you did. There's something...more about me and you, people in general, than just memories. Call it destiny, genetics, whatever. You can wipe out their memories, but they make the same mistakes again and again. You don't see the potential in a new start, but anger over the past. You become the same person all over again, no matter how many times I try.\"\n\nMy eyes widened. \"What do you mean by no matter how many times I try?\"\n\nSuddenly Robert moved, impossibly fast and pressed his thumb against my wrist. I didn't even have time to scream. A strangely familiar numbness began to spread through me. I couldn't recoil as Robert kissed me and caressed my cheeks. The last thing I heard sent chills down my spine, even as I faded.\n\n\"Destiny or not, Liz, I will keep trying, no matter how long it takes.\"\n***\nif you enjoyed, check out [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/)  ",

            "comment": "Honor and justice were words for politicians. Eraser had always believed in a single driving force to his heroism and that was efficiency. If the name was catchier, he would\u2019ve called himself Factory Man, instead, he took the name Eraser for his powers in wiping villain\u2019s identities. He took not just their memories, but the memories of all who knew them, rendering them a completely blank slate. Albeit a powerful one. \n\nWhat the world did with those people after he wiped their memories, he couldn't care less. Hot-faced politicians screamed about retribution. Make those bastards pay for what they took ten times over. Stern-voiced suits talked of rehabilitation. People couldn\u2019t be punished for a crime they no longer remembered.\n\nIn the end, America settled on the Reawakening Program, a half-assed rehabilitation center with nightmare conditions. Neither side won and nobody was happy. Though, that was the beauty of democracy.\n\nEraser had his own condo on Lazarus Island, the host of the Reawakening Program. Five days out of the week except for holidays and paid time off, the government stocked him here. Long ago, all the great supervillains had been erased and reawakened. Now, only the small fish remained and there were other heroes far more suited to handling those.\n\nThe doorbell rang and Eraser sighed. He hadn\u2019t even finished his morning coffee yet.\n\n\u201cMr. Eraser,\u201d came Sarah\u2019s voice. She was an intern fresh from college and still treated him with something resembling politeness. \u201cWe have the first batch ready.\u201d\n\nIf the name was catchier, he was sure the government would have also call him Factory Man, due to how he was simply a cog in the reawakening process.\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d she asked when he gave no reply. \u201cWould you like me to come back another time?\u201d\n\nHe flipped through old newspapers. He had requested it to read stories about himself. It was pathetic really, but not as pathetic as the current state of affairs. The world\u2019s greatest hero now working on some memory altering production line.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like the profiles? We have a mix of villains today, ranging from unpermitted protests to small theft to even\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, cutting her off. It didn\u2019t matter who the villains were. There was a system for vetting them and he trusted in it. It wasn\u2019t his job anymore to pass judgment, not for Factory Man.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Sarah said, \u201cShould I\u2026 wait here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can find my own way.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d But she stayed at the door. He could hear how hard she was breathing. \u201cSir?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he spat. Patience was a virtue for the young. The old didn\u2019t have enough time for it.\n\nA newspaper clipping slid under the door. Curious, Eraser took it and scanned the headlines. The Great Reset, it read, with a giant picture of a younger him. His brow furrowed, staring at the picture. His cheeks were tighter, his eyes sharper, and his hair a burning red. He didn\u2019t remember a time before his beer belly and faded eyes, yet here he was, chiseled.\n\n\u201cYou reset the world,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cAt least, you tried to. You saw that it wasn\u2019t right. Violence, hate, war, disease, inequality, the world needed a fresh start. You even reset yourself.\u201d\n\nHe only half-heard her words, his eyes were too busy flitting across the newspaper article. It called him the Soul Eater for leaving people empty after their battles. His heart skipped and his tongue curled around those words in familiarity. Soul Eater.\n\n\u201cBut a few people escaped,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd with the world a blank slate, they did with it as they pleased. It\u2019s even worse than before. It\u2019s all wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 you were one of those people that escaped?\u201d\n\nThe door opened and Sarah stood in front of it, lockpick in hand. She looked like Soul Eater from the newspaper clippings, her eyes just as sharp, and her hair just as bright.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I inherited your powers.\u201d\n\n",

            "comment": "I was sweating. Beads of perspiration trickled down my brow and I wiped at them absent-mindedly. My hands shook as I read the newspaper clipping. My eyes blurred as confused tears appeared. \n\n'Violent And Erratic Weather Patterns Cease' the headline read. But that headline had been enough. I closed my eyes, and the the tears came. That had been me. I had called myself the Weatherman back then. I could control the weather. I could cause tornados, storms, lightning. I could give myself a cushion of air to stand on and effectively fly. I had terrorised the city. For the briefest of six days, I had acted publicly. Unable to hide my powers from society any longer, I had decided to come out of the shadows and present myself to the city. And promised to rule.\n\nSix days. And then she came. And all was gone.\n\nThere was a knock on the door. I hastily crumple the clippings and other artifacts that hinted of my past and stuffed them in a briefcase, and slid that briefcase inside my cupboard. And, wiping away sweat and tears from my face, I answered the door. \n\n\"Hello, James. You look like you've been up all night.\" my therapist said, letting herself in. Right. Session sixteen of the prescribed twenty-two sessions. I stared at her for a moment, wondering if I should tell her the truth. I had been seeing her on and off for about ten years, but she was still a therapist, no matter how cheap her sessions were. Truth was I had been up all night. Digging deep into the past. Looking for the incident that gave me my amnesia. The amnesia which also made me forget I had powers.\n\nThe newspaper clipping, and the vambrace I wore back then as a part of my ridiculous costume, now broken, lay in the briefcase. They were hard evidence of the Weatherman. Of me. The clipping was published on the November 12, 2007. A decade ago. It had been a decade since I was the Weatherman.\n\n\"James?\" the therapist called from my kitchen. She had a habit of making coffee for our sessions. \"Yeah. No sugar this time.\" I called back, shutting the door softly and taking my seat. \"I asked you if you were up all night.\" she said. Damned therapists.\n\n\"Yeah. I was looking at books and hobbyist magazines and such. Trying to remember what I liked to do.\" I replied. She did not say anything right away, and all I could hear was her pouring coffee into a mug. \"And?\" she asked finally, bringing the mugs into the living room.\n\n\"So far, nada.\" I lied. She looked at me for a second. Then said, \"Your memory is slowly coming back. That's good. But you shouldn't rush these things. Maybe stop thinking of what ifs and start thinking about facts. What you liked doing in the past, what you wanted to do, thinking about those things right now are just wild shots in the dark. You need to focus on what you know. What you're good at. Focus on the now and on the future, James.\"\n\nI sighed. She was right. I shouldn't focus on the what ifs. I should go on with my life until I knew facts. But I knew facts now. I knew what liked to do. I knew I was the Weatherman.\n\n\"After the incident. After you were discharged and everything was hazy and finding a job was difficult. What did you do? You went through your personal belongings. Went through your home, and found your degree in accounting. And then you realised you liked numbers. And what do you know? You found a job in a school office. And what happened there?\" she prodded.\n\n\"I automatically got into my old accounting habits. How I sit in the chair. How I twirl my pen. How I organise my stationery. And a few months into the job I started getting my memory back. At least memories of my old job at the bank.\" I replied.\n\n\"Exactly. Stick to your guns, let your memories come to you at their own time. Stop grasping at shadows.\" she said.\n\nI wasn't grasping at shadows, though. The memories had come. They were real. I stared at my hand, at the mug, and willed a breeze. And almost gasped when I felt cool air gather and gently push at my hand. The tendrils of swirling steam changed direction and followed my breeze. I was the Weatherman. I looked back at the therapist. She who told me not to dwell on my past and start looking at the future. To try and build from what I knew.\n\n\"You.\" I said in a low voice.\n\n\"What?\" She asked, he brows creased.\n\n\"I was the Weatherman. And you.\" I growled. The memory came back. Six days I was ruling my city. And then she came. My hands clenched. My fingernails dug into my palms. The window burst open and a gale blew in. Loose paper started flying. The wind carried me off my seat.\n\nHer. That day. Day six. She took everything from me. My city. My power. My memories. And then.\n\nAnd then she sat before me. Telling me to stop prying into my past. The past that she hid from me. From the minds of everyone who knew. Telling me to move on. Telling me to focus on the now and the future. Telling me to become a better man then I was in the past. \n\n\"James. Please.\" she looked at me, her eyes pleading. I stopped my control, and the wind violently ripped apart and dissipated, throwing me across the room headfirst into the wall.\n\nWhen I came to, she stood over me with concerned eyes. Her mouth moving but her voice distant. She pulled me to my feet. \"Why?\" I heard myself ask. She pursed her lips, and helped me to the couch. \"Why?\" I asked again, my voice stronger, my senses returning.\n\n\"Why what?\"\n\n\"Why everything? You took away my memory, my power. And then for a decade you've been helping me recover and get my life back together. Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"That's... I don't know how to answer that right now.\" she said.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Look. I think you're concussed. I'm going to drive you to a hospital but you have to promise me you're not going to try anything.\" she said, ignoring me. \n\n\"I'm not promising shit till you tell me who the fuck you are and what games you're playing with my life.\" I shot back.\n\nFor a second it looked as if my words had hurt her. But then she steeled her gaze. \"Yours isn't the only life I've been playing with.\" she said softly. I stared, mind racing.\n\n\"I knew one of you would eventually figure it out. I'm lucky it even took this long. Wiping not only your memories, but everyone who's been involved, who's been in the loop. That's hard to do. Hardest of all was you. That's why I stopped bothering with anyone who went public with their abilities.\n\n\"You were the Weatherman. But there were more villains after you. You just happened to be my first. There was the Jailbreaker, Pyromancer, Great Giggle, Mannequin, Master Bob, Lightsinger, Groundbreaker and Ice. Unique names for unique individuals with unique abilities. Abilities that they used to abuse and destroy.\n\n\"So I stepped in. When I saw you flying up there, summoning your lightning onto cars and trees, I knew I had to use my power to stop you. I guess that was my destiny. I spoke to you. Do you remember what I said?\" she asked.\n\n\"'Stop. Stop this before anyone gets hurt. Stop or I'll take your power away.' I remember. You were in my mind. Talking to my thoughts. You were just a kid.\" I said, remembering, startled.\n\n\"Nineteen. But yeah. I'm a telepath. I can control people through their minds. My abilities surfaced a month before you did. But didn't go around screwing things up. I guess my parents raised me right.\"\n\n\"And the others after me?\"\n\n\"All nine of you I'm keeping tabs on. Making sure you move on smoothly. Groundbreaker owns a gift shop. And I used to work there while I got my PhD in psychology. Master Bob, Jailbreaker, Great Giggle and Mannequin are doing well. Lightsinger and Ice are going in and out of rehab for substance abuse, unfortunately. But at least they aren't freezing or frying anyone who looked at them wrong. Pyromancer is out of town. Visiting a cousin in India. He's doing relatively well, too.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I'm a therapist. Trying my best to see all of you.\"\n\n\"So what? You're a saint? Guiding the wicked to the right path?\"\n\nShe looked at me, a flash of anger in her eyes. \"What I did to all of you was perverted. It was gross and wrong. Mind reading is just plain criminal. No one should have the power to invade another's mind and control what they know or remember. But it had to be done. Because you all were abusing your gifts and we're on the road to becoming full fledged psychopaths. I had the power to stop it. So I did. But I'm no saint.\" She said.\n\n\"And yet you're here, to see us through. Making sure we do right by society. Giving us a second chance. Seems saintly to me.\"\n\n\"Stop it. What are you going to do now?\"\n\n\"You tell me, telepath.\"\n\n\"Didn't you hear a word of what I just said? I don't believe in reading another being's thoughts.\"\n\nI sighed. \"You're on a weird path of righteousness. But I believe in you. If you really think I can move on, then I will. In my cupboard is a briefcase. It's my link to the Weatherman. I want you to promise me that you'll burn it. Burn it before you take away one last memory.\"\n\n\"You want me to make it as if this session never happened.\" she guessed, taking a deep breath and steeling her resolve.\n\n\"You read my mind.\" I smiled.\n",

            "comment": "My name is Geoff, and I work as a CPA for a fairly prestigious accounting firm. I have always been great at math. Since I was a child, I excelled in all of my classes. I graduated as valedictorian, and I went on to become a lauded CPA, or so I thought. \n\nThe other day I was going through some old newspapers that my firm had tucked away... I don\u2019t know why an accounting firm would hoard newspapers but I digress. \n\nOn the front page there was a story about a man who used his massive intellect to inflict pain upon he city. They called the man, The Intellegencia. This super villain was able to use his mind to control computers, and he was capable of using his advanced intellect to stop nearly every hero that came after him. He even managed to kill Cosmo, The Universal Hero (this dude could control the fabric of the universe. He could increase gravity exponentially and even manipulate time. He was powerful). \n\nNow I do not usually care about what heroes and villains are doing. For the most part they do not affect my life. But this Intellegencia guy is different. He was wearing a mask, but I can recognize my own eyes from anywhere. \n\nThis man plastered across the front page is me. \n\nI\u2019ve heard of a superhero, The Wash, who can wipe people\u2019s minds. He has psychic powers that allow him to control and manipulate people (good thing he is not a villain). He doesn\u2019t like to fight. Instead, he uses his powers to wipe the minds of super villains and to set them up with new lives. I always thought it was more decent than killing them or whatever else Supermonger and Ratman do to their villains. But now that I know it\u2019s happened to me, I don\u2019t know how I feel about it anymore. \n\nI mean, I like being Geoff. I make a decent salary, and I have a beautiful wife (well she has an overbite but she is a solid 8 out of 10). We are expecting our first child in about three months. If I go down this rabbit hole and try to figure out my past, I could lose all of that. (I wonder if my wife used to be a super villain. Maybe she got bit by a rabbit when she was young and developed steel chomping powers. Seriously, that overbite is crazy). \n\nThat being said, I\u2019d like to know why I was such an evil person. I mean now I don\u2019t even squash spiders. I use a cup to take them outside and set them free. How could I have killed people? What would make me do something so horrid? \n\nMaybe I can find The Wash and ask him to take away this particular memory. He\u2019d probably do it. It would allow me to just be Geoff and continue on in my life blissfully unaware of the pain I had caused. No, I need to know why I was who I was. \n\nThis won\u2019t change me. I know who I am now. I am a good person, and I know that knowing the full extent of my powers will help me change the world for the better. I am now Geoff, not The Intellegencia, and I will help the world. \n\n",

Now, with Dom Perignon soaking into my carpet and the soles of my slippers, I wondered if I wasn\u2019t just overly shocked. \n\nI had known for some time that there was something different about me. Something special\u2026 I had just thought feelings like that were the realm of fifteen-year-old girls, not 65-year-old men. I had ignored them. I scolded myself now as I refocused my attention on the scrapbook of newspaper clippings before me. There I was, headlining most of them. \n\n*The United Nations formally recognizes \u201cMuninn,\u201d a powerful telepath and telekinetic, as the supervillain mostly responsible for the 2008 stock market crash when he imbalanced the real estate market through subtle influence of major financial institutions.* \n\n*Is Muninn the Supervillain Responsible for Deteriorating Relations Between U.S. and North Korea?*\n\n*Dr. Charles Kingley \u2014 better-known as Muninn, president of the recently self-proclaimed International League of Villains \u2014 is finally captured with the help of hero CleanSlate, who promises to wipe the man\u2019s memory and return him safely to society. This could be a new era for international prison reform\u2026*\n\nA scowl shot across my features as I ran my hand through my thick white hair. A dirty trick, wiping the mind of a telepath and telekinetic. I reached out and the brown paper that had once wrapped the scrapbook drifted lazily up into my hand. There was something comforting and familiar about using my powers, as though a part of me that had been missing was suddenly returned. I\u2019d never lost my abilities, I realized. I\u2019d simply forgotten to try and use them.\n\nSomeone had sent me this scrapbook, hoping to trigger my memory to return. Someone wanted Muninn back, but who\u2026? There was no clue on the wrapper, no return address, and I turned my attention back to the scrapbook. Flipping to the last page I saw a note that I\u2019d missed when my mind had been overwhelmed with a rush of returning memories. \n\nIt was short message, written in a feminine hand that some part of my mind recognized. \n\n*\u201cWelcome back, Charles. Love, H.\u201d*\n\nI struggled to recall a name to attach to the handwriting, but that was something my mind wasn\u2019t ready to give back just yet. The scowl deepened as I realized how long a road I had ahead of me. Someone had answers, and I wouldn\u2019t stop until I found them. ",

Big, bold, broad, and bald, Larne Leadman pushed his weight through the hole to bring the rest of the wall down around him, the brick crumbling down his shoulders. \" There's no need to keep up with me!\"\n\nThere was nothing Larne enjoyed more than demolition, and he was good at it. Amazing at it in fact. He could brush off cave-ins as he barreled through mountains to open new mines. He could dip his hands into molten steel to squeeze a broken crucible shut. His friends in labor joked that he should take to being a superhero, but that was never his speed. Breaking things was all he really wanted to do, and there was plenty of good work in that field.\n\nToday, he was bringing life back to a destroyed district of Bell City, by tearing down old buildings that were barely left standing from some terrible disaster some time ago. His crew left him to tearing down most of the place, while they focused on clean up and scaffolding in his wake. He hummed a tune to himself as he swung and punched through layer after layer of concrete and steel.\n\nAnother wall down, and he found himself in the remains of an apartment, buried under six obliterated floors. Most of the furnishings were in various states of decay, and the smell of spoiling meat and mold hit his nostrils, pulling him out of the ecstasy of destruction. The walls creaked and cracked, Larne's actions had weakened everything keeping this place in-tact.\n\nHe dropped his hammer and searched out the source of the smell. The broken remains of a couple that had been entombed there were all he found. Scattered cans and boxes showed they survived the initial disaster, but died before any kind of help could have arrived. Larne was shaken at the sight, confused and heartbroken. His confident shoulders dropped as he bowed his head silently a moment, his once smiling face broken.\n\nPulled away from his quiet by another rush of foul air, he set to search out the identity of the couple. No telling how long the walls would hold, so he didn't have much time. He scanned through the various papers and mail they had scattered on a table, and could see the scrawled curses this couple had written against a \"Hazmat\". They hated this person with every fiber of their remaining days.\n\nLarne was close to sharing the couple's feelings on Hazmat, until he found the newspaper story, on Hazmat's upcoming assault on Bell City. He saw the picture. He saw the headline. Hazmat's plan to bring the world crumbling beneath his feet. A man ready to detonate a nuclear weapon at point-blank range, just to watch the carnage it caused from the front row seats. It was him. It was Larne. He was Hazmat.\n\nLarne threw the whole table like he had just found a nest of spiders, smashing it against the opposite wall, making the already brittle walls crack even more. Who was he? What could have brought him to do this? Pieces were missing. Three women, some kind of weird greek names, though none of them were greek. They were members of some organization. They changed something in him. What was it? Did it matter?\n\nHe snapped out of his thoughts and looked down at his hand. It was in a tight, shaking fist. His nails were cutting into his palms, and shimmering green blood was dripping out of it, lighting up the whole room. He had never seen his own blood before. Or did he? It sizzled and melted the ground where it dripped beneath him. What was he? The questions kept pouring in, and it only made him more anxious.\n\n\"Boss! You alright in there?\" The sound broke through the chaos in his mind. The building was crumbling even more around him, but this place had held his secret long enough. He slammed his fist against one of the supports, bringing the whole building toppling down around him, crushing him beneath the ruins. Not that it mattered, as he would crawl out of the debris within a few minutes, swimming through the rebar like it was water.\n\nHis friends gathered near the crumbling rocks to reach out and help him out, but he waved them off. \"It's alright, this is nothing.\" He said with his usual chipper smile. \"You boys should have been there when half of San Gabriel tried to pin me down.\" He brushed off concrete dust and pointed back at the worksite. \"Lets break early for lunch, I'm buying us all burgers.\"\n\nCheers from his friends reminded him who he was now, and he was Larne Leadman again. He wasn't Hazmat anymore. He didn't want that deceased couple's hate on his heart, he didn't want that horrible life back. Whatever the Fates had decided for him, he was happy where he was, and he would never look back. \n\nThough finding out he could probably survive a nuclear blast was giving him ideas for new career paths.",

            "comment": "The first time I killed a man, I swore I'd never do it again.\n\nWe're more than just the sum of our experiences.  People, I mean; there's always that core of *who* you are, whether you're human, andlarian, an eighth-dimensional overbeing from the planet Klaaarg or just an uplifted, intelligent dog.  I guess it's probably what you'd call a *soul.*\n\nYour experiences *shape* that, mold it and twist it every which way; in another life, Steadfast might have been an insurance salesman, or Revenant a waitress, or Kinetic a soldier.  Instead: Paragon.  Avenger.  Scientist.\n\nSuperhero.\n\nYour experiences may not be the be-all, end-all of your existence, but they play a role in who you are in *this* life...and I can take that all away.\n\nI discovered my abilities as a child.  I was able to take...*moments,* from people.  That candy bar I'd walked out of the store with.  That chore I never did.  I was an entitled little brat, to be honest, but none of that part of my life really stuck with me.  A haze of childish hedonism, taking advantage of everyone I could get my hands on.  (Literally.  That's how my powers work.)\n\nThe first time I killed a man, it was my father.\n\nHe'd started to piece things together.  Missing moments, missing tidbits that he remembered but my mother didn't, or vice versa.  I'd had a good run--I was fifteen at that point--but I was a child, sloppy and careless.  One night when my mother was out, he confronted me.  I, being the arrogant, self-centered little shit that I was, tried to reach him, to make him forget the whole thing.\n\nHe grabbed a knife.\n\nThe details of the scuffle were unimportant, really.  He didn't get to take many swings at me before I got my hand on the back of his head.  What I remember most clearly about that fight was what happened after: my father, confused, frightened, and entirely unaware of who he was, who I was, who he had been.  I took his whole life after high school away from him, and so the man who raised me was as good as dead.\n\nHe ran.  I did, too.\n\nI don't know what my mother thought when she came home to find us both gone.  I know my father eventually turned up at his childhood home, confused and scared, and eventually had one too many nervous breakdowns and jumped from a thirtieth-story office.\n\nSteadfast caught him before he hit the ground, but the light had gone out inside of him.  He made it two more years before drinking himself to death.\n\nAs for me...it goes back to a blur.  I didn't accomplish anything worthwhile in my late teens and early twenties.  I stole, I took advantage, I lived for me.  What else could I have done?  What else *should* I have done?\n\nThe second time I killed a man, I found out the answer to that question.\n\nFirebug was a small-timer, in the grand scheme of things, but to me, he was the most frightening man in the world.  I happened to be in the lobby when he decided to hold up a bank.  I watched him burn frightened tellers, people I'd been fooling for months into helping me live in the lap of luxury, and I did nothing.  I watched him burn terrified hostages, and I did nothing.  I watched him turn on a wailing toddler, watched him flick that gaudy lighter he used to kick-start his flames, watched--\n\n--I watched his arm fall to his side, the lighter clattering to the ground, his eyes meeting mine through those horrible tinted goggles of his, the confusion and fear playing across his face as I pulled his head back, until--\n\n--until the light went out, and Firebug was gone.\n\nThe hostages ran.  I did, too.\n\nI kept his stupid lighter, though.\n\nI remember...I remember the *shame* of it.  Like I'd done something *wrong* by saving all those people.  I remember running from myself as much as from fear of recognition.  I remember...I woke up, days later, in a puddle of drool and vomited pills, and decided it was time to be someone new.\n\nThe third time I killed a man, I was as kind about it as I could be, considering the circumstances.\n\nDoctor Kringle, to be quite frank, (and I am), didn't deserve it.  He was a real bastard, and only a *real*  bastard would have hit on the theme of being an evil Santa.  Of all things, an evil *Santa.*  He couldn't even name himself something clever, or Krampus-themed, or any of that.  No, he'd dress up like Saint Nick, ghost himself into people's houses, give their children exploding presents or poisoned cookies, and then disappear.  He'd hit a few dozen homes each Christmas night and then vanish, and the American superhero community was running itself ragged after two consecutive Christmases of his heinousness.  They were finally zeroing in on his base of operations.  It was sheer luck that I got to him first.\n\nThe damnedest thing about Doctor Kringle was that he looked for all the world like that jolly-faced white-bearded corporate-controlled goofball image that was the modern-day representation of Saint Nicholas.  He looked the part, and so...\n\nI found him through some old friends of mine, friends who quickly forgot I'd ever been there.  I snuck in while he was out buying groceries.  I hid in a maintenance closet under a pile of spare Santa costumes, and when he went to sleep that night, he never woke up.\n\nWell, Doctor Kringle never did, anyways.  Christopher Freudenberger woke up just fine, in a motel ten miles down the road, with no memory of his crimes, or his abusive parents, or his failed attempt at starting a candy store in his youth.  All he remembered was that children were joyful and innocent, and that all he *really* wanted to be was Santa Claus for them.\n\nHe embraced his new life wholeheartedly.  I did, too.\n\nI wasn't responsible for *every* disappearing supervillain.  Some of them were killed by their own plots, some retired or gave up, some just decided to melt back into the population and pretend nothing had ever happened.  Me, though?  I took down dozens over the years, from nobodies like Billy the Squid all the way on up to heavy-hitters like the first Earthmover.  Still don't think I did a great job with that one--you all found him pretty quickly after I got him.  I'm not gonna blame you for hauling him off to Faraday; the man'd held whole cities hostage before.  Still...I was pretty proud of having successfully shifted him over to wanting to start a family and settle down.\n\nI hear his daughter's stirring up trouble in New York, these days.  Maybe you should look into her before she causes some real damage.\n\nYeah, I can see you out there, Steadfast.  You always were terrible at blending into the background, even in civilian clothes.  I know you can hear me through the walls, and I...want to thank you for letting me finish this recording.  It's terrible, to be forgotten.  I should know.\n\nStill, maybe I'm not as forgotten as I thought I was.  This morning's paper, for instance.  That article by Kinetic's reporter friend was a gripping read, and it's really good to know that you heroes never stop looking into the unsolved cold cases.  Learning about the ongoing mystery surrounding the brain-death of small-time supervillain Firebug and the disappearance of his longtime partner Oblivion, well...\n\nSometimes, I wish I could forget that day.  I suppose in some ways I already have, but they were important ways.  Ways that made me who I am now.  The things I'm missing, I didn't need.  They made me...someone different.  Forgetting who Oblivion *really* was made me...*better.*  Reading this article just highlights the cruelty and callousness of my youth, and that, too, is something I don't need anymore.  I'd really like to forget it.  Until today, I already had.\n\nI already threw the paper in the fireplace.  Used Firebug's stupid lighter to start the fire, too, and I'm now certain that this isn't the first time I've done that over the years.  I'm not asking everyone else to forget about Oblivion, you see; I'm just asking that you let *me* forget him.  In fact, all it takes is for me to grip the back of my head, like *this--*",

            "comment": "\"Damn it all! Damn it!\" I yelled at my pitch black sorroundings. My white hair fell in front of my face as I kept screaming. \"Why the hell would he do this?! Why?!\" I struck that interior metal wall, denting it. I then began to shed tears.\n\n\"This morning,\" I sobbed slightly, eyes closed, still trying to forget the events of today, \"The past months, no years, I had a life. I had a loyal lover. I had children. Even grand children. Then great grand children.\" I opened my eyes and moved my newly unwavering gaze from the nearly invisible far wall, to my hands; my scarless, plain, and muscular hands. I clenched them into fists. \n\n\"And no one told me who I really was. No one wanted  wanted him back. They wanted a nobody. They wanted me to fade away.\" I looked back at the wall, trying to use my powers again, to no avail. Only thing I could see was a slight shake of the wall, and at that I closed my eyes again and tried to calm down. *She wouldn't want me to damage anything*, I thought to myself. I smiled at that thought.\n\n*She was the only one to care. She was the one person in the world who knew my pain. I can't wait to see her again.*\n\nI tried to remeber the good morning I had. The coffee alone. The phone call with my \"family.* And then I tried to remember the single letter I recieved that day. It was a simple note, and a small article from that mornings newspaper, that I never recieved before. The note read, *I miss you, come back-with Love S.* At first I thought it was simply a case of the mailman giving me the wrong mail, but then I read the news.\n\n\"Today marks the 50th anniversary of the successful operation the regime took to end the tyranny of the False Emperor. The man known to have nearly conquered the world with an army of enslaved soldiers, bent on making us all bend to his will. May he never return to ravage our glorious Empire! Long Live the True Emperor of Sol! The hero who beat the Immortal Emperor singlehandedly!\"\n\nAt the top of the small page, lies a picture of a toppled statue. A toppled statue of myself, as I looked today, with a single man stood atop it.\n\n*What he did to me was worse than death. He not only took my life from me, but he kept me as a man enslaved to his empire, when it should've been MINE.*\n\nThis time the metal room around me did begin to shake and crack. I knew what was happening. \"My power is back.\"\n\nIt was at this point I got out of my seat and went toward the left wall, and pulled back a horizontal plastic bit, revealing the crimson stained glass. Beyond it, lied the ruins of North America. I watched crumbling buildings come and go. I watched bird and beast roam through the streets. I watched everything from up high.\n\nSuddently I heard a the pop of a microphone, \"My Lord, we will be arriving to HQ in 60 seconds please keep seated for the landing,\" a firm female voice said.\n\nI didn't acknowledge her. I only nodded and returned to my seat, my basic white and gold robe hovering just above the floor as I moved. It was now, I noticed the thrum of the engines and the shifting moments of the helicopter. I remained silent and peaceful until we landed.\n\nThe doors flew open to the sight of dozens of black camouflaged soldiers guarding the helepad with a single red-robed black-haired woman who had purple eyes, and a face so beautiful it could charm any man.\n\nAs soon as I walked out, the breeze picked up, causing my robe to nearly fly off, and Other black-camouflaged helecopters began to arrive to what now seemed to be an old ocean-bound fossil fuel refinery. As I arrived closer to my greeting party I noticed more and more soldiers began to pour out of all sorts of hatched and door, preparing for who-knows-what.  They moved barrels and netted boxes around. Pulled up ancient devices from the depths of the platform, and moved in such a way that it looked like a choreographed dance.\n\nThe woman in front of me noticed my curiosity and smiled. \"They are a well oiled machine, and will be ready for whatever is to come, Korian.\" \n\n\"Korian,\" I stated out loud, \"That's my name.\"\n\n\"Yes it is, and it is a name long forgotten to those that once feared it.\"\n\n\"I think it's a good time for them to remember,\" I stated smirking.\n\n\"Then shall we get started, my love?\"\n\n\"Yes, my Soria, we shall.\"\n\nI am home.",

The sunrays imbued me with their tender heat, it reminded me of a hug brimming with love.\n\nI went to the kitchen, stretching as I walked down the stairs. The scent of freshly made hotcakes swirled into my nostrils, drawing a smile on my face. I felt *good.* Everything was alright.\n\n\"Honey, someone left a box for you. It's on the table,\" my wife said, carrying the pile of hotcakes toward the table. When we crossed paths, she kissed me. How did I manage to find such a lovely woman?

It can't be, is she Kissladan?*\n\n\"What's wrong honey?\" she said and sat in front of me. Her blue eyes drowned into mine and I blushed like a child.\n\nI set the newspaper aside, I was happy. \"Nothing sweetie, just a bad prank.\"  \n\n",

But I can guess exactly what went through my younger self's mind. I must've thought to myself...\n\n*I wonder what I could do with all this power.*\n\nAnd I don't know if maybe thinking it a second time jogged my memory somehow or... I don't know. I don't! Maybe what made the difference was seeing all the end results laid out in front of me, all the horrible things I already did, all the suffering and the death, and I failed anyway. I met the Lorekeeper in battle and I lost; I never conquered the world, and that man who tried is gone as surely as if he'd been killed.\n\nI don't want to do that again, Sara. I promise you I won't. How much of this did you know before we married? They must have contacted you at some point by now; they must've told you who I was, what I did. But for you to stay with me after that, you couldn't have known everything.\n\nI should tell you. You deserve to know, if you didn't already. I have enough time to leave these papers for you, but I'll be gone by the time you get home. I searched for more details online, and I'm sure it must've raised an alarm for the Lorekeeper. She'll come to confront me again, and I'll let her take me back.\n\nBut first, the truth. In my old life I was Hunger. I drew power from eating living creatures. I could use the bodies of anything I consumed as raw material to transmute into... anything, really. I've checked, and it's all still there. Enough that if I just spilled it all out at once, I could squish this city with it. The whole city. Then I could absorb the dead from the ruins, add them to the pile...\n\nI could probably kill the Lorekeeper if I did it. If I tried again, right now. When we met that day, I was growing stronger on an exponential curve, and it was about to go straight up. All it would take is one city rendered down into biomass and I would be invincible.\n\nAll it would take.\n\nThe fact that I can think that means there's something wrong with me on a deeper level than my powers, Sara. Because the whole time I was doing it, the whole time I was Hunger, I kept telling myself it was worth it. Two or three cities' worth of life was a lesser evil compared to any war I could avert by taking over the world. I told myself the math checked out.\n\nNow I'm looking at it all laid out on our kitchen table. It wasn't worth it. I failed. Every single person I ever killed died for nothing.\n\nNo. Maybe not. I can't go back to doing what I did, but I do have my powers back. The biomass I've already collected is still a usable resource. If I surrender to the Lorekeeper when she comes, if I offer to use the power I already have for good. Maybe she might let me do what she does. Taking people alive. I'm strong enough for that already. I don't need to ever kill again to do it.\n\nI need to prepare for this, but I don't have a lot of time and I don't like my chances. If she doesn't like my offer, she'll wipe my memories again and what happens if I find these pictures a second time? I might change my mind again and go back to evil. It would be so easy. \n\nNo, that's not good enough. I need your help, Sara; I'll hide these notes in a place only you would ever find them. So you can remind me of who I was, so you can help me contact her preemptively. I need her name. I might be able to find it before she arrives, and if I leave it here for you...\n\nThe Lorekeeper's secret identity. Her face under that helmet, her name, who is she? I'll find it and I'll write it here. Her name is\n\nSara?no\n\nno no no you can't be",

            "comment": "She looked out over a wasteland, newly born from her rage. She had tried to help them, and they had repaid her with death. Well, death is something she now understood, and was more than willing to give in return. The metal blade in her hand rang once more with her power, ready to carve another great gash in the ground. The tattoo on the back of her head glowed bright, ready to announce to her enemies who they could thank for the devastation when she walked away, leaving their city in ruins.\n\nAs she raised her blade to strike again, chains of light sprang up from the land around her, binding her tight and drawing her to her knees against the ground. The blade fell with a clatter, out of reach and useless. She sent all of her power into the chains, but they did not react to her command, and a scream of helpless fury erupted from her throat and tore her world into blackness.\n\nSarah woke from her nightmare with a start, sweating and clammy. The dream was unlike any she had had before, but probably just a result of her class project she had fallen asleep while working on. She picked her head up from the desk, a piece of paper sticking to her cheek from the drool. Getting herself together, Sarah rearranged her notes on what was formally known as simply, \u201cThe Incident.\u201d There was not much information available about the perpetrator, other than the moniker given to him by a hack tabloid writer trying to make a name for himself: The Blade who Cut the World.\n\nThere were some survivor interviews and pictures of the person that were taken after the Incident and before the \u201crehabilitation\u201d process, but they were locked within a secure website. Sweeping her notes into her bag, she slung it over her shoulder and headed off to the university library, where, as a research institution, they might have access to the information she needed to complete her project.\n\nThe public-use computers in the library were no help, but she batted her eyes at the research librarian, who blushed and let her use his administrator account on his computer while he went on break. Turns out the school did have the proper credentials to access the website with the information she needed. Skimming over the survivor reports, a chill ran up her spine. Some of the details were eerily similar to her half-remembered dream. Going over to the file photos of the perpetrator, she saw a tattoo of a flaming sword on the back of a bald head. The next photo almost made her fall out of her chair. A face contorted in rage stared back, almost unrecognizable except for the eyes and a cut across her cheek. Her eyes, and a cut in the same shape of the scar from the car crash that killed the rest of her family.\n\nStumbling out of the library, Sarah ran the entire way back home in panicked disbelief. She went into the bathroom and locked the door, although she was alone in the house. Looking into the mirror, she saw the same eyes from the picture, except now there was fear in them instead of rage. The car crash had happened three years ago, the same time as the Incident, erasing much of her memory of her life prior. The one memory she had was her mother running her hands through her long hair as she brushed it, saying how pretty it was and that she hoped Sarah would never cut it. And she hadn\u2019t ever since the accident, as a way of honoring her mother\u2019s wish. \n\nBut now she held scissors in trembling hands, locked eyes with herself in the mirror, and began to cut. Once she had cut down to the scalp on the back of her head, she took a deep breath and picked up a hand held mirror, angling it so she could see the back of her head in the main mirror. And the flaming sword tattoo that had been revealed. The perpetrator of the Incident hadn\u2019t been a man after all.\n\nThe mirror fell to the floor, shattering, as Sarah vomited into the bathroom sink. Looking back up into the mirror, she locked eyes with herself once again. \n\n\u201cI am the Blade who Cut the World.\u201d\n",

To think, I had just wanted them out of curiosity. Today was a rare day off for me, no clients and no research to do, so I had decided to read up on before I lost my memory. A car crash, that's what they told me.\n\nI didn't even need to look at the name, it all came back as soon as I saw that picture.

The girl who was scared of the dark, liked to play house with her dolls, and wore nothing but pretty pastels. You'd think she would be the kind of woman that would become a trophy wife or an equestrian rather than a mastermind that single handedly brought our city to its knees time and again for close to a decade. I recall during her peak that I'd often have to stay home because of the physical similarities between us and often found myself terrorized by her victims or their families. To say it was bittersweet when she was finally defeated would be an understatement.\n\nStill, I found myself at our family home, in her room and struggling to contain my tears. Our parents kept it exactly how she left if when she decided her \"career\"; maybe hoping that sweet little girl would one day return. I can't blame them for it but really, even if she decided to hang up her supervillain crown, there is no \"normal\" for our family anymore. The vandalism on both mine and the family home should've been a glaring indication of that. The ReWire system had failed us as even after she was captured, they have us in limbo as they wait for more paperwork.\n\nAs I walked around, examining the familiar furniture with passing interest, my eyes came to rest on a strange sight. A small stack of newspaper clippings that looked completely new compared to the dusty interior of the room. I walked curiously to the stack and found they were nothing more than clippings of my sister's more infamous stunts. Probably some vandal trying to terrorize us with this passive aggressive BS. However I felt drawn to looking at them closely.\n\nAs I looked at each, I noticed something odd. My sister had always prided herself about her perfect skin. It was something she always liked to rub in my (pimply) face as a teenager. However, in every one of these pictures of her, her faces was married with faint scars and blemishes. Each picture with almost identical markings meaning it would be almost impossible to be a printing error. So why did she look more like me?\n\nLike...me...?\n\nIn a single instance, it all made complete sense. The pieces falling into place like the clippings that slipped and floated to the ground. I felt the breath leave my body but I felt the rise of a cackle slip through my teeth. \n\nIt had worked! I gave my sister to the ReWire authorities and they wiped her instead of me! I went ahead and rewrote my own memory to make it impossible to completely wipe my memory. I beat it. I actually beat the system! I doubled over as the laughter began to escape my throat with growing intensity. The fit seemed to last forever like I had finally had a long-due release but I quickly composed myself after allowing it. It was time to plague the city with a \"new\" reign of villainy. \n\nI. have. returned.",

Getting up, heading to work, waiting for my boss to leave to play some Grand Theft Auto, going home and spending my last free hours in Just Cause. \n\"Still playing those childish games at your age?\" isn't rare. \nWell, I don't really care. There's just this certain... thing about destruction that I can't find the right words for. Something I just can't explain using just words. A feeling deep embeded in my soul. Something I would never get rid of even when seeing death with my very own eyes.\n\nSadly I can't make it reality. Humankind rejects destruction for what they call progression. I can't stand it. Where's the point in living that life? \n\n\"So? what are YOU gonna change? Exactly. Nothing\" he said. It's the only thing I remember from that day. He told me I happened to be in a car accident. Hit my head; got a scar across my left eye; all that stuff. To summarize: I lost my memory. \n\nI don't remember my childhood, my parents, not even my name. In that case I thought why not name yourself James Light. Yeah that James Light. The one, who singlehandedly brought chaos and destruction to the states. The person I adored each and every day. Born a genious, rising from absolutely nothing to the person everyone feared the most. He's what you could call perfection.\n\nTo bad everyone rejected my name. Now they call me Steve May. I hate it.\n\nWell, I should get going. My shift is over and no way in hell am I spending more time here than I absolutely need to. At least the roads are almost empty. While I would complain that I feel watched, it's been like that every day so I guess it's just me being paranoid. \n\nI fall to the ground\n\n\"S-s-sorry, I wasn't looking where I was going\", she stumbled. \n\nI looked at the paper she dropped. \n\n**18 Nov. 2009 - James Light reveals face!**\n\nWhy'd anyone use a paper these days?

I kept my room neat, you could even say it was orderly. Pardon the pun.  \n\n\"You ready?\" The tall orderly with the beard asked. \n\n\"Yes, me ready.\" I responded and followed their lead as they stepped out into the hallway. We walked casually down a long hallway and I waved to my neighbors Frost Giant Shemp and Mad Mike as a I passed their rooms. Both of them had ironic nicknames, I'm assuming they called Shemp a Frost Giant because of his stark white hair and small stature and Mad Mike was the nicest guy you'd ever meet. It was how the orderlies referred to them, which is why I didn't think twice when they gave me my nickname. I assumed it was because I am neat.\n\n\"Hey Yeti,\" shorter guard said to me as he looked over his shoulder, \"how's class going?\" \n\nI couldn't remember what life was like before I came to live here in the rehabilitation center. The doctors said I had a form of amnesia though they weren't specific as to what caused it. According to the official story, they found me wandering in rural Oregon. I don't remember any of that either. \n\n\"Class good,\" I replied, \"we make story with papers.\" \n\nThe assignment was to take disparate articles we liked from newspapers and weave them into a complete narrative. We could use as few as ten, but as many as we wanted. I like science fiction, so I tried and looked for ones that suggested some kind of mystery. Every time we met for class we would bring in snippets and paste them to a storyboard. \n\nI liked the local stuff and the idea of the wilderness has always fascinated me. So I looked for animal sightings, missing persons, anything that would suggest the presence of some wild, but unknown beast was lurking in the area. \n\nIt started with a story I found in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer from three years ago. A local wild life researcher, Ian Cinetti, who claimed to have evidence of a new undiscovered, possibly bi-pedal mammal living in the Pacific Northwest had gone missing while collecting evidence. He had been missing for 72 hours at the time of the report. \n\nThe next article was from the Portland State Vanguard and detailed the events of a UFO sighting in Albany, Oregon roughly at the same time as Ian Cinetti's disappearance. \n\nThe challenge was to start to weave these into a narrative. \n\nThe third and fourth articles detailed some hikers that had gone missing in the region. Then more lights in the sky, a man who claimed to have been chased home by what he described as Bigfoot after leaving a marijuana dispensary in Portland. On and on these articles I had collected went. I had about thirty or so and went way over my minimum of ten... but I was weaving together a great story and didn't feel as though I had reached a conclusion yet. So there I sat, after arriving in class, combing through old papers when suddenly I felt a chill run down my spine. \n\nThe headline read: Unknown Primate Savagely Attacks Zookeepers Before Releasing Primates. \n\nWhere they serious? I double checked the header, this was the Seattle Post-Intelligencer alright. A legitimate paper with this kind of headline? \n\nThe article said the zoo was closed until further notice and provided no further detail.\n\nI quickly clipped out the article and added it to my cache. It was then, when I was re-arranging my articles that I first noticed it... the swelling in my hands. \n\nI found the next day's edition of the PI and sure enough, the front-page headline read: Lions, Tigers, Bears, and Apes: Animals Escape Woodland Park Zoo.   \n\nIt turns out this unknown primate had released all of the wild animals from their enclosures, the paper had no further details. \n\nI clipped this one as well and thought to myself that I never remembered my arms being so hairy. I sat in that room for another hour following this event. The unknown primate was estimated to stand between nine and eleven feet tall and weight between 900 and 1200 pounds. \n\nThere were satellite images showing this thing, which I would only describe as Sasquatch or Big Foot leading a herd of wild animals ranging from Apes to Tigers and even a Komodo Dragon. The National Guard had been brought in and there were hundreds of fatalities at this point. \n\nMy instructor must've noticed I was growing uncomfortable, I was pouring sweat and I felt like a stuffed sausage inside my clothes. I saw the fear in his eyes when I looked up at him and suddenly I could hear everything. His heart beat, the roars outside of my army beckoning me. \n\nAll I could think was, \"man bad, he trap animal, he murder Earth. He hurt Gaia. I hurt him. All of him.\"\n\nAll I could say was, \"RRRRROOOOOOARRRR!\" \n\nMy shirt ripped across my back as I reached up and grabbed my instructor by the neck. My hands were the size of catchers mitts and they were covered in hair. I squeezed his neck like an empty juice box and he gurgled out his dying breath. \n\nFlinging his lifeless corpse across the room, I leaped onto a desk and my pants ripped off of me. My legs were just as hairy as my hands and I couldn't see skin anymore. I could hear gun shots outside and I knew that Shemp and Mike had returned to their forgotten forms and had come to join me. \n\nTogether, with Mother Nature supplying my army we will finally rid the world of mankind and return the Earth to it's glory.",

She hated fieldwork, took no pleasure in it, and certainly didn\u2019t enjoy being sent across the country for one single target. But still, here she was, one week into her assignment and not a single lead- the runaway this time was like a ghost, leaving only a few clues leading all the way to this dead end of a city.\n\nThe light clatter of porcelain from the kitchen roused her from her thoughts, and Edith looked around the shop, taking in the cozy little business with a keen eye. The interior was shabby, to say the least, with a hodgepodge of comfortable armchairs, eclectic collection of tables, mismatched dishes, and a garish orange-brown paint job that loudly advertised the owner\u2019s utter lack of aesthetic sense. But the smell that hung in the place was divine, and for that Edith could forgive quite a lot.\n\nThe barista himself was young, shaggy, and muscular, wearing a tight-fitting shirt and a pair of jeans. If he hadn\u2019t been the one behind the bar and the spatter of brown stains on his clothes, she would\u2019ve assumed he was just another patron. But there were no other patrons- the only other customer had left soon after she had arrived. Odd- she looked at the barista again, at the faux-casual lean and the errant dart of his eyes. Was he-\n\n\u201cHere you go Boss.\u201d\n\nEdith jolted in her seat, almost knocking the coffee from the barista\u2019s hands in surprise. Unphased, the barista smoothly swung the coffee away from her, and then back again without spilling a drop. Nodding apologetically, Edith accepted the steaming beverage and leaned back in her seat. The barista gave a short bow, and retreated once more to the safety of his bar.\n\nSipping at the steaming liquid, Edith looked over the case file once more. The runaway was a class 0 threat according to the dossier, with only enough power to fly a kite indoors. Despite that he had been a part of Sanctuary- the largest villain group to date, and was reportedly one of their inner circle according to one of the few bits of information the retrievers could get their hands on. The group had completely disappeared a few years ago, yet here was one of their top brass, alone, standing awkwardly behind the bar- as if daring her to make the first move. Letting out a low sigh and slowly shifting her body, she took another, much larger sip, fully appreciating the flavor for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe coffee is delicious.\u201d\n\nIt really was.\n\n\u201cThank you, Boss.\u201d\n\nHis bright green eyes were intense and unblinking. He knew.\n\n\u201cWhat flavor is it, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d\n\nSlowly, with her hand hidden below the table, Edith reached for the gun at her hip.\n\n\u201cNostalgia.\u201d\n\nBefore Edith could bring the gun to bear, the table before her shot forward and slammed into her chest- knocking her deep into the plush depths of the armchair. *Threat level 0 my ass*, she thought as starbursts exploded across her vision. Gasping for breath, she pressed one hand to the fabric of the armrest, and another onto the table that was pinning her down. In an instant, the table went limp, and she threw it away from her, spinning the hardened armchair around to block another weaponized table. It bounced off harmlessly, and in the short lull that followed Edith drew her gun, aimed at the shocked barista, and pulled the trigger. \n\nHis eyes went wide as the small electric dart whizzed through the air and impacted into his shoulder, causing him to spasm violently and fall, hitting his head on the counter on the way down. *Ouch*. Edith winced apologetically. She really hated field work. Taking a deep breath, she rounded the corner of the bar and stood over his still-twitching body.\n\n\u201cI am Officer Edith Brown of the Retriever Task Force, you are under arrest.\u201d\n\nEdith leaned down, reaching for his forehead, recalling several pleasant memories to tide him over while she worked on a much more believable backstory to feed him back home. But then a small torn photograph floated into view and she froze, hand inches from his face. The image was faded and worn, featuring a gaggle of gap-toothed children gathered together at one end of a sterile white room.\n\n\u201cI know who you are, Boss.\u201d\n\nBefore she could even begin to comprehend the contents of the photo, Edith flew backwards- impacting lightly onto the painted stone wall of the shop. The barista stood, seemingly unharmed, an unspent electric dart floating a few inches above his upraised palm. His words were hard and sharp, but his eyes were another matter altogether- red-rimmed and damp. Once more the photograph floated up before her eyes, and Edith looked harder at the worn piece of paper, pushing against the invisible force that held her down to grab hold of it.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Boss. I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d\n\n\nJust a misdirection, just like all the rest. Desperate rage, excuses, pleas, desperate cries for mercy, but mostly just lies- they all try the same tricks when trying to escape the law. It\u2019s why she hated fieldwork the most- all it takes is one touch and then it doesn\u2019t matter anymore, but until then it was all just such a pain.\n\nEmpowering her arm for one desperate push, Edith grabbed hold of the photograph and swapped it with the wall, slamming her heel backwards to break the paper blocks that held her captive. The wall crumbled under the force of the blow, distracting the barista long enough for her to draw her gun once more, aim, and fire. The dart caught him in the neck, and with a stuttering wail the barista flopped uselessly to the floor. *Got him!*\n\n*Damn telekenetics\u2026* She rubbed her aching muscles and turned, placing one hand on the soggy paper blocks and undoing the damage- returning the wall back to its original shape and form. Looking down at the crumpled lacquer photograph in her hand, Edith deflated, and returned it to its original form too. Actually looking at the image for the very first time, she wondered why he had been so insistent on the thing. He hadn\u2019t even tried to run, he definitely had the power to, so why bother? She certainly didn\u2019t remember him, but from the beginning every word out of his mouth seemed to imply that he knew her.\n\nAnd then she saw them- a boy and a girl, side by side among the jumble of kids. One meek and despondent looking with a mop of messy blonde hair, and the other tall, dark-haired, and defiant- and an exact match to a photograph in her father\u2019s apartment. It had always looked a little off, and now she knew why. Reaching for her phone, she cut it, and then reached for his forehead. \n\nIf he really did know her, and she had a reasonable idea why, then she had to know the rest of the truth.\n",

            "comment": "Unification.\n\nA simple word, and one I had never given any amount of thought to. At least, not until today. I sipped my coffee, bleary-eyed as I completed my daily habit.\n\nWars, murders, brilliant inventions turned into gruesome weapons, pollution, theft. All manner of sins, all types of evil. It's all the same. For nearly a decade, every single morning, I've combed through daily newspapers and found no real difference. Ideology, reasoning, ethical justifications, the end result is always the same.\n\nI've made a fortune pandering to people's filthy desires, investing into a market designed to help private interests rather than public prosperity and writing screenplays, novels, everything, with one simple message. Treat others as you wish to be treated.\n\nBut no change. Nothing. As I stare at that single word, a proper noun rather than its usual common form, everything just seems so familiar. But now, I have a lead. Something to investigate.\n\nMy position allows me access to a lot of information, information some might seek to destroy for the sake of their own vision for the world. As such, I contacted a few assets and put out requests for whatever they can dig up on Unification. With nothing left to do, I went about my day. As curious as I was, anxious to the point of shaking, there was nothing more to be done. For now.\n\nThe next morning, for the first time in years, I skipped my daily routine. Instead, I began reading about this Unification, a mysterious billionaire who, seeking to conceal his identity, funded proxy wars, terrorist groups and social schisms with the intent of weakening world powers. Initially thought to be simply an exploitative, amoral and selfish psychopath, superhero raids on a database uncovered meticulous plans to unite the world by force. Preferably for each other, preferably with long-term mechanisms to ensure cohesion, but as a worst case scenario, against him and his private armies.\n\nThe thought of the panic and riots this would cause was thought to be too much for the group, who generally preferred to redeem villains and make use of them for their vision of world progress. As such, after finding and redeeming him into a mere ignorant philanthropist, they destroyed all records they could find. Or so they thought.\n\nI lowered my coffee cup and sighed. What a waste of time my ignorance has been. Or was it me? It really doesn't matter, this was never about me.\n\nThere's still work to be done.",

            "comment": "Ever since the accident, I've been having headaches. They said it wouldn't last forever, but it's been over two years and lately they've been getting worse. I stopped fighting it a long time ago. In a way it's comforting, the physical pain helps dull the memory of losing her.\n\nTo be honest, I can't remember much from before the accident, but I could never forget Ashley. She was everything to me. We had been married for five years and were trying to start a family but it just wasn't in the cards. It was my fault. Something called Klinefelter syndrome.\n\nIt was hard but we had been through so much, shared everything together, right up until the end. That was my fault too. I didn't see the light change. When I woke up they told me I was lucky to be alive. Funny thing is, I don't feel lucky.\n\nI groan and pop a few painkillers as I roll out of bed. \u201cDon't think about her, Joe. You have important work to do.\u201d I'm an analyst for a classified government project codenamed Clean Slate. We hunt down dangerous criminals and use a metahuman named Rehab to wipe their memories so they can be reintroduced to society. My job is to think like them, to get in their heads and assess the likelihood that reintroduction will be successful. Not everyone can be saved.\n\nThere is an unfortunate side effect. The only way for the project to work is if everyone who knows them has their mind wiped too, a clean slate. The project is kept a secret because they don't think the world will understand. But I understand. I would give anything to forget the things I've done, for just one day without the pain, without the guilt. Everyone deserves a second chance.\n\nI pour some coffee and boot up my PC to get started. Working from home is one of the perks of a top secret project. Our latest target is a particularly elusive assassin that we've nicknamed the Queen. She seems to turn up all over the world and always leaves the same calling\u2026\n\nThe five words in my inbox catch my attention: \u201cYour life is a lie.\u201d As I click through the articles, I don't want to believe what I'm seeing. I don't want to believe it, but I can't help thinking it makes a lot of sense. I see my own face, attached to a wanted poster for a notorious cyber thief who stole billions from other criminals and major corporations. Wasn't it my skills in bypassing cyber security that helped me get this job in the first place? How many times have I been tempted to keep the money for myself before thinking that's not what she would have wanted?\n\nThe message was anonymous and untraceable, even for me. This isn't just a joke, someone knows what they're doing. I want to ignore it but the evidence is overwhelming. It certainly would explain the headaches and memory loss. I never wanted to know what happens after.\n\nIt's the last link, simply titled Lotus, that makes my blood run cold. Inside is a birth certificate for a girl named Marissa, my daughter. A video starts to play. A young woman is staring out a window. She doesn't talk, barely even blinks. Her room is covered in drawings of lotus flowers and two doctors are discussing her condition. \n\n\u201cWe've been calling her Lotus. We don't know her real name and she hasn't responded to anything we've tried. She doesn't seem to recognize anything we show her, as if she isn't storing memories.\u201d\n\nThe tears are hot as they roll down my face, boiling with pain and rage. Getting into his house was easy, there's no need for security when nobody remembers what you've done to them. He didn't even deny it. When I said the word Lotus his whole body sunk in shame. All he could say was it wasn't supposed to happen, he's regretted every day since. I heard enough. That's when I knew everything we had been doing was horribly wrong.\n\nPulling the trigger is nothing like the movies. When I dropped the flower at his feet I felt nothing. No relief, no regret. Just a cold emptiness and the feeling that anything inside of me that ever mattered was gone.\n\nWhen I got back to my apartment I knew something was different. My computer was on and the Lotus file was open but it wasn't the same. There was no birth certificate, no reference to me, even the girl in the picture was different from the one I saw in the video.\n\nThat's when I saw the empty pill bottle by the keyboard and felt my lungs start to tighten. The room started spinning and I saw her standing over me as I fell to the floor: the woman who was supposed to be my daughter. I felt her close my hand around something cold as she whispered in my ear, \u201cyou played the pawn well.\u201d By the time I realized I had been played I didn't care. I let go, the queen rolling to the floor as I welcomed the darkness.\n",

I swear, I saw some documentary about how cubicles were limiting our minds and restricting us from our... something or other. Stepping out of the building as the buzzer sounded, I tried to quickly navigate the crowd and get to the front. The zombified movements of the civilians nearby me meant being stuck behind the slowest walkers you could imagine. \n\nHowever, they were set to get home at a certain time, so they walked at the perfect pace for their destinations. \n\n\"Speed up!\" I whisper-shouted out to the noiseless sea of humans.  A couple turned towards me and attempted what I presumed to be a ... scowl? The electronic grating sound of cameras turning irritated me, but now I knew not to speak again. Wasn't worth whatever happened. \n\nWhen I had made it back to my apartment, I noticed a faint line of dust arranged in a strange way near the wall. As I pushed on the wall, it fell out and hundreds of trinkets exploded on to my lap. The stuttered roll of an oblong toy-car wheel brought my attention to my left side, where a pile of dusty and yellowed papers had fallen and scattered. I combed through, my eyes falling on one particular headline dated 2010.\n\n'PROJECT VERO SUCCESS!' \n\"Mitch Donovan, Mayor of New York City, commented on the development of the Wall. 'The people behind those walls needed it, what can I say. All those years of their life that they wasted with their previous occupation can now be erased! In one moment, our technology, implanted into one amazing mans' mind, can be used to completely rewrite a humans history. For example, the people living behind those walls are living the ideal life: structured, safe, and purposeful. All of them contribute to the overall health of the city. We have chosen twenty of the most notorious evil- diets and masterminds... and started a new civilization. A civilization where no one will ever rebel- because they don't know they can. These men and women were the legends of their time, but they'll never know it. And this is how we keep our city clean.' Below are the listed names of the original twenty- \nRACHEL MCCORMIN\nDWAYNE SARTEL\nKRISTOPHER MILLI\nDYLAN SERGEO\nRUFUS TOR\nFELLIPE-\"\n\nI never got to finish that list, for I was interrupted by my daughter calling from downstairs. \"Daddy!\" she called urgently.\n\nI rushed down the squeaking stairs and joined her at the window. Far away, in the horizon, something was running towards us- and in the distance, the rubble and broken remains of a Wall I had somehow not seen before. \n\nThe un-oiled door screeched open and my wife walked in. \"Rufus?\" I heard her call out. I tore my eyes away from the window as the sound of a camera turning caught my attention. \n\n\"Was that always there?\" My three year old girl asked.",

            "comment": "\"Thursday evening, it was a Thursday evening sometime in December, five years ago.\" My reply seems so empty for such a question, it was so much more than just a day, it was rebirth, it was epiphany, it was an unbelievable discovery. Feelings of hatred, joy, curiosity, worry, fear, wonder, but most of all, a feeling of purpose. \n\n\"Mr. Gaines?\" The journalist rousing me from my stupor. \"Call me Simon, please, not so much formality.\" I can't stand formality, I leave the organization and order for my machines. On top of it all, I despise people calling me Mr. Gaines. Reminds me of my old job, of my old boss, and of my father. Two men that couldn't have died a moment sooner than they did. \n\n\"Simon then, what was the process of realization? How did you come to remember your past before the erasure? What exactly happened?\" She stares so intently across the table. \n\n\"Funnily enough, it was a newspaper article, an op-ed interview piece like yours.\" I still remember every tiny detail as though they had been burned into my eyes permanently. \"I walked into my apartment, the door was ajar, no surprise there, the landlord was always breaking in, though I had no proof, he always dropped hints about how he was making extra money, like he was incapable of completely hiding his crimes. The man always used to say things like 'shame that Simon Gaines' property was taken by a petty thief',  so much emphasis on my name, like it was supposed to mean something, and after that evening, I realized it did.\" The journalist looks at me quizzically for a moment\n\n\"What does that have to do with the question exactly? Other than the part about the door being ajar.\" I chuckle lightly in response.\n\n\"Nothing all, I'm just being tangential and overly dramatic\" She sighs heavily after looking off past me out the window.\n\n\"You do have a flair for the dramatic, Mr. Gai- I mean Simon\" she seems to think she has to appeal to my ego or some such similar pleasantry. How many times do I need to tell her not to be formal or over polite?\n\n\"All that aside, back to answering the question. The door was only slightly ajar, I figured my little 9 volt trap had scared the idiot off, I'd started putting them on my door after the break-ins got bad, nothing but slight painful shocks, couldn't understand my affinity for constructing them at the time. Regardless, I came in and sat down at the table. The room was ungodly cold. I decided to start a fire. First though, I wanted a cigar. Hadn't been able to get decent ones in months, so I tapped the last vanilla Prime Time out of its package, put it in the corner of my mouth, and threw the package into the fireplace. I picked up the news print on the way over to the start the fire along with the firewood.\"\n\n\"So finding the article was complete chance, a fluke?\" The journalist was thoroughly surprised. guess the rebirth of a super villain is something that you'd think happens by pure luck.\n\n\"Absolutely\" She looked even more stunned. Maybe she thought I was joking? \"I only paused because it was a Tech article, two years old maybe It was on the dangers of AI and advanced machines, and  I had a fascination with robotics and electronics that I couldn't understand, I barely caught the title before it went into the fireplace\".\n\n\"You have got to be kidding me\" her eyes full of shock\n\n\"Not even slightly.\"\n\n\"Continue please, I'm intrigued.\" no longer was she tired looking and leaning back in her chair with disinterest, but sitting on the edge of the chair wide eyed, with pencil and notepad at the ready. \n\n\"The article was a fear monger's work, spinning worry and malcontent towards machines. It included an interview with a police detective and a man they called Blank, they made him out to be some sort of hero, said he had just stopped the 'evil machine mastermind himself, known as Circuit, who's programs and robots had done everything from murder, to commit credit and identity fraud.' underneath his quote was a picture.\"\n\n\"And the picture was you?\" The journalist could barely contain herself.\n\n\"Yes, but my hair was shorter in the picture, and my now scarred face was instead adorned with wires and my eyes were covered by goggles, and the mangled hand, missing several fingers, that was holding the article, instead was adorned with chrome artificial digits in the photo. As I read the photo caption 'Pictured above is Simon Gaines, commonly known as Circuit, standing in front of a pile of his destroyed machines, after his memory has been erased by Blank' my now lit Prime Time fell from my lip. I was only drawn out of my awe trance by the smell of the carpet burning, and i stamped out the cigar.\"\n\n\"What did you do immediately after that?\" the journalist clamoring for more.\n\n\" I wrote my girlfriend a loving note, apologizing for leaving, telling her it wasn't her fault, and that I wasn't who I said I was, that she shouldn't try to find me for her sake. Then I left for the nearest hardware store and electronics boutique.\" The retelling of the tale bringing me fairly close to tears, thinking about the paradoxical mix of confusion and certainty that came with my realization.\n\n\"Everything came back to you? All the previous knowledge?\" the journalist had nearly stood from excitement at this point.\n\n\"Everything, instantaneously\" the words slipping effortlessly from my mouth, as though nothing else could have been said. The journalist leaned back in her chair after finishing her notes.\n\n\"Well Simon, this has been a wonderful interview, and these last thirty minutes have been particularly interesting, but it is rather late, and I should get going, I would like to return tomorrow to learn more if you don't mind?\" She said as she stood and put on her coat.\n\n\" Of course, that sounds fine, its good to get this all out for once. I look forward to seeing you again tomorrow Ms. Sykes\"\n\n\"Please, if you insist on a lack of formality, call me Paula\" and with that, she left me hear at my table, wondering what the hell I should do till I fall asleep, waiting impatiently to continue my story again. ceaselessly tapping my new chrome fingers against the large granite counter top. \n\n\"Dammit, never going to sleep now. Huxley! Make me a gin and tonic!\" and the servant droid got right to work.\n",

Just me, going to the library, ditching the shelves of carefully written and fact checked books for the lawless internet of un checked information, when I came across a website.  Forgottenvillansofseattle.com \n(Don\u2019t ask how my research led me there)\nI was amused at first, obviously it was a joke.  Then I saw a picture of myself.  Had I discovered my doppelg\u00e4nger?  My interest piqued. I started reading.  Apparently I had once been the most powerful villain in Seattle, with the power to convince people of things using only my words.\nOh, and I could move objects using my mind.  Basically I was a Jedi. An evil Jedi.  So a sith I guess?\nAnyway, about 3 years ago I had risen to power to the amazement of many in my small city outside Seattle.  A nine year old accomplishing amazing things.\nI wanted control, and fish.  So I set my sights to Seattle, the jewel of the Pacific Northwest (screw you Portland).\n But Seattle was protected.  Erica wentz put a stop to me. \nOur local superhero.  She\u2019s great.  Well, I used to think she was... now I\u2019m not so sure.\nI had power, prestige and at age 9!\nNow I\u2019m a socially awkward, anxious 13 going on 14 year old who can hardly talk to a crowd, let alone control a city.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason I wrote this.  To see if my powers are still there.  To see if reading my words is enough to convince you of what I once was.  \nMaybe it\u2019s time for Eileen vs Erica vol. 2. \nWatch out Seattle.  \nYour favorite evil Jedi is back.",

            "comment": "It was the kind of discovery that felt like it should have been made on microfiche. I should have had to hunt around the library awkwardly, waiting for a librarian to look as if she had found a moment earmarked for my interruption. A few minutes of hemming and hawing about how I need help while she flexed years of experience and avoided rolling her eyes that yet another asshole in the library didn\u2019t seem to realize that her job is being a professional research assistant. I would follow her to a special section of the library, she would pry open a sticky, ornery drawer and pull out a tiny roll of microfiche. In all likelihood I would be unable to avoid saying something like \u201cWhat is this, a newspaper for ants?\u201d and again she would show off how well she can not roll her eyes at me. Finally, maybe forty-five or so minutes later, pen stashed over my ear, my hand against my forehead, pushing my hair out of my face I would make the discovery and lean back from the reader dramatically.\n\nThe internet makes these things much less sexy. I clanged a series of keywords in no particular order into Google and clicked a bunch of things. There it was. Very little mystique. Instead of cinematic build-up, it\u2019s just me going, \u201cHuh.\u201d\n\nThe mask obscured things quite a bit in the photo because it\u2019s a real mask, not one of those \u201conly covers your eyes\u201d bullshit eyemasks. The capes always used to wear those masks because chances are if you were a cape you were a media whore. Not that only the capes wore capes but they had that flair for the dramatic. A cape makes a certain impression and for a hero the statement they were making was always themselves. Sure, they were out there stopping villains, but what\u2019s left behind after you\u2019ve stopped a bad guy? Nothing. Just you, standing front and center. So why not wear a big-ass cape.\n\nVillains tended to be more subdued, more background. Not in terms of what they did, of course, but that was the point. Villains left behind craters, wreckage, bodies. Those were their statements. You feared a villain because you knew what they could do, not because they had spiky shoulder pads.\n\nThe mask in the photo just left a general sense of facial bone structure, but it had room around the eyes, space for slippage. The last thing any villain wants is to be suddenly blinded by a mask slipping over their eye in the middle of a battle.\nI was in the middle of a research project on villains and their cities. Trying to explore links between the culture of a place and the sort of villains that rise there. My town hadn\u2019t had a villain for decades, which is abnormal these days. I hit the library to see if I could dig anything up.\n\nI did not expect to find myself. \n\nIt\u2019s surprising this doesn\u2019t happen more often. Slate was a roamer; he didn\u2019t have a home city. He\u2019d defeat a villain, wipe them clean (hence the name), and then move on. Must be that when you have to rebuild your entire life over again you have more pressing matters than what all the supers are doing, to say nothing of bothering to look into what they used to be doing.\n\nThe eyes are mine. There\u2019s no question in my mind. There may be things I don\u2019t know, gaps here and there, but I know myself. When all you have to build from is your body and your face and what hints it may hold about where you came from, you study it closely.\n\nAcross this gulf of time and situation I would expect a photo like this to be alien. Disconcerting. Like looking at another person in another body. I\u2019m a past-middle-age community college student starting to worry about what I need to get done to manage a semi-plausible retirement in twenty-odd years. This photo is of a brutal supervillain reveling in carnage and power. But looking into those eyes doesn\u2019t feel like staring at a stranger or looking back on days gone by.\n\nIt feels like looking in a mirror.",

A shotgun held firmly in one hand, a strange yellow device in the other. The caption printed underneath in faded black letters.\n\n*David B.

Nothing seemed to break my trance, not the cool air as I stepped out of the shed, not the smile of my wife sitting on the back porch. \n\n\"Did you find your dads drill, sweetie?\" she asked from the table, cutting into a biscuit with a small butter knife. \n\n\"Did you know?\" I asked, hoisting myself onto the wooden deck. \n\nShe stayed seated, careful not to get any butter on her yellow sundress.

I quickly stepped forward, my hands open.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, my face was burning red.\n\nI took another step. She thrust at me with the butter knife. The dull silver slammed into my palm. She threw herself from the chair and ran. I held my own now bleeding palm. Neighbors stared at me, one with a camera, the other with a phone to his ear. I staggered into the kitchen. On any other day, it would have smelled of bacon and eggs. I pulled gauze from the cabinet, wincing as all sorts of cold and allergy medicines tumbled out. I winced, yanking the knife from my own hand. The bandages clung tight to my shaking hand. I slowly changed clothes, being cautious not to spill any blood on another button up. *Driving is out of the question*, I thought looking down at my hand. I stumbled onto the street. A few neighbors glanced in my direction but quickly turned away. I made my way to the bus stop. Police sirens wailed in the distance. The black and white car could be seen prowling through the neighboorhood, lights blinking. I shoved my hand into my pocket, the fabric around it forcing a wince out of me. A small drop of blood began to bleed through. The car crept closer. Two cops, both talking on a radio and urgently checking house numbers. I sat on the curb, putting my knees to hide the crowing dark crimson stain. The car stopped in front of me. A large officer behind the wheel rolled his window down. I could see myself in the reflection of his sunglasses. His massive yellow mustache shook when he spoke.\n\n\"How far down is 1112?\" he boomed. I used my right hand and pointed back to my own house.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said. The tinted window lazily rolled up.\n\nThe car rolled down towards the house. I let out a hard breath. The police car parked in the driveway. *Shit*, I thought, *the front door is wide open*. I stood up and started walking. Next bus stop was only a few blocks down.\n\n---\n\nThe morning air was still cool when I stepped off the bus. In front of me was a plethora of chain stores brimming with people. My leather wallet, luckily, was still in my back pocket. A few people shot me puzzled glances; hiding my hand was futile. I entered a toy shop towards the end of the outdoor strip mall. The interior was completely illuminated by harsh artificial light. Rows upon rows of neon plastic shapes lined the walls. Early Christmas shoppers were out en masse. I picked up a *DARF* gun, a yellow and black shotgun model for young kids to blast each other with. I put it under my arm and made my way to the costume section. A few out-of-date Halloween costumes clung to the back of the shelves. A single Mister Memory mask was on a worn out hook. I threw the mask over the side of the shelf with a curse. A small \"Bubbly the Bee\" mask caught my eye. Its wide cartoonish eyes were a light blue with a fake glisten of light in them. Instead of intimidating mandibles, it wore a large pink smile. I snatched it up and took both items to the cashier. The girl manning the register was dressed in teal. She looked at me with an even stranger look than the bus driver. \n\n\"They share birthdays.\" I smiled, handing her a ten.\n\nI stepped back onto the busy streets. People pushed and shoved their ways to get the best deals that were really no different from the normal prices. After picking up a trenchcoat and some yellow spray paint, the plan could be executed. I ducked into an alley, supplies in hand. I sprayed the jacket down a bright wet yellow. It stuck to the cheap imitation leather in streaky drips. I took the gun and began to grind off the obvious DARF gun logo. \n \n\"Uh, h-hey,\" \n\nI spun around clenching the toy firearm. The girl in teal, a cigarette in her hand.\n\n\"I know you did some bad things but-\" She explained \"I'm a big fan. None of the heroes even listened to you.\"\n\n\"Do you know what happened to me?\" I asked, clenching a fist.\n\n\"Well yeah,\" she said holding her hands behind her back \"Everyone saw it\"\n\nMy cheeks went red. Imagining everyone able to see Mister Memory lobotomizing me sent a wave of embarrassment across my face. \n\n\"What are you gonna do?\" She asked, half pointing to my scratched up DARF gun.\n\n\"I'm going to get my research back.\" I boldly stated, putting my chin up. \n\n\"With that?\" She asked.\n\n\"What other choice do I have?\" I said, dropping the gun. She stood there in front of me, just looking at me. She took another drag and put out her cigarette.\n\n\"Come with me,\" she said.\n\n---\n\nWe sat in the parking lot of the police department. The string on the cheap mask was tight around my head. The yellow jacket I made was stiff from where the paint dried, with a few wet spots on the pockets and inside. I kept my hand tight on the real gun she bought me on our excursion across town. She gave me a peck on the cheek through cheap plastic.\n\n\"I'll keep the car on across the street.\" She explained, \"If you get your stuff it should be easy enough to just walk out.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I told her, pushing open the car door and wincing at the pain in my hand.\n\nI looked back at her once, the sun just went down across the suburban horizon. I walked towards the glass doors, legs slowing with each step. *What's pushing you?* I could hear in the back of my head, *That's not you anymore*. I held the handle tighter. I could feel something click. A slight twitch began in my eye. \n\n\"For the bees,\" I grunted.\n\nI slammed the entrance open. A tattooed teenage cuffed to a chair screamed at the sight of me, then started hysterically laughing. A cop was still at his desk. His eyes were wide, he slowly sat his coffee down.\n\n\"Pick it back up,\" I demanded. He complied, keeping his other hand in plain sight. \n\n\"Evidence locker,\" I barked, he gestured his mug to a back room. \n\n\"No,\" I said thrusting the pistol towards him \"You go, I'll follow\"\n\nThe pudgy cop slowly lifted himself up. I could see his holster on the desk. I followed closely behind as he made his way down a hall. \n\n\"Hey Gene\" I heard a man say to my hostage.\n\nI pointed the gun over *Gene's* shoulder. Again, I saw myself in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. A blonde mustache wiggled nervously at the sight of a gun barrel.\n\n\"Well,\" he said putting his hands up, \"Gene you wanna take the night off?\"\n\n\"If you wouldn't mind, sir,\" Gene said.\n\n\"You wanna let Gene go home to his wife, sir?\" The other officer asked.\n\n\"You think I'm that dumb?\" I said, \"I have a Ph.D.\"\n\nThe cop pushed Gene into a wall. He threw himself at me. I fired. A bit of drywall was shot into the air. A fist connected with my mask. I felt the bottom half of the plastic crinkle and snap. He had me on my back, pummeling my face. The ring on his finger breaking up my mask and nose. I hit him hard on the side. He slammed down with both hands. My head was throbbing. \n\n\"Come on *Bee Brains*,\" The officer screamed, \"Use that degree of yours\"\n\nThe officer grabbed my sidearm off the ground. He began to eye it down, checking the chamber and safety.\n\n\"You know I never really liked that memory stealing sap. The only way to really put down a mask is with a goddamn bullet.\" He laughed.\n\nHe slowly stood up, gun trained on my head. I placed my arms on my chest in pain. The officer kept laughing at me. Blood trickled onto my mask and back in my mouth. I put my hands into my jacket.\n\n\"You people make me sick,\" He said\n\nI yanked out the spray paint, finger hard on the nozzle. A wide smear of yellow streaked across his open mouth and sunglasses. I rolled, a bullet flying past my ear. He fired wildly into the walls. Gene made a break for the fire exit. I kicked the officer hard in the shin. He hit the carpeted floor face first. I rolled on top of him, taking his head in both my hands. \n\n\"What's going on?\" The teenager yelled from his seat in the back.\n\nI ignored him, slamming the man's head into the floor repeatedly. The sound of his mirrored glasses cracking was muffled by the carpet. I slowly got up, grabbing my gun from his limp fingers. I spit a mixture of saliva and blood on his back. The evidence room was clearly marked, and the door, surprisingly, unlocked. \n\n(PART 1)",

            "comment": "They say curiosity killed the cat. It's a saying designed to keep people from doing dangerous things and finding more than they bargained for. It's totally inapplicable to humans. Curiosity kills cats because cats are stupid animals and can't do anything with what they learn, so the risk is for nothing. Intelligent curiosity is the reason humanity rules the world and not tigers.\n\nRather a painful truth than wilful ignorance, I say. And, judging by my most recent, heh, discovery, what I've always said.\n\n\"Professor Scintillation Caught!\" proclaims the newspaper. I run my fingers lovingly over the photo adorning the front page. I like the costume. I would, naturally, but it bears saying. It's a good costume. A lab coat that looks white from a distance but when you get close the light reflects out into a rainbow. I always did like showing people the light, heh heh.\n\nProbably the only thing I did like back in those days. I was a very angry young man. All \"Those fools at the academy!\" this, and \"You'll see my true brilliance!\" that, and so on. What a waste. Ten years and all I did was hurt people to try and be relevant.\n\nI mean, it was a good run. Most supervillains only last a few weeks before they get shot by the police. Turns out, most people are vulnerable to bullets. Who would have thought? Heh heh heh. Still, I really wasn't getting anywhere. I was surviving, and people knew who I was (or rather my nom de guerre, but semantics), but I wasn't really accomplishing anything.\n\nYouth is wasted on the young. That's another saying that I have issues with. Our strongest years are spent teaching us how to accomplish things and since we're strong we can recover from our mistakes faster. I was young, I learned a variety of ways to accomplish things, and now that I'm older and not quite as much of an idiot I can start putting them into practice.\n\nSuppose I have to thank Wipeout for that. I can admit, with the benefit of years as a, heh, model citizen, that I was in a rut. He forced me out of my comfort zone and gave me time to learn without being distracted by my, in retrospect, pathetic need for attention.\n\nStill, wouldn't do for my second wind to get ruined by another wipe, especially now that he's the only other person who has any memories of how my light technology works. Heh heh. Thanks, Wipeout. I'll be sure to write you a very touching eulogy after I kill the parasites afflicting our society.\n\nHeh heh heh.",

            "comment": "After I realized it, I froze. But, as I stare more and more at the newspaper all the way from 1940, I see a ring on my finger, that I found in an old drawer just weeks ago. I quickly search the old drawer again, hoping that the ring would open up my past, but it was gone.\n\nSeveral years have past, and my son comes up to me holding a strange thing in his hands.\n\n\n-Daddy! I found an old ring!-said the boy. The ring was quite rusty and old, and it had strange drawings on it so precise, that is impossible to do by hand.\n\n\n-Daniel! Give me those rings now!\n\n\n-No, Papa, they look really cool!\n\n\nDaniel put the ring on his thumb, because it would only fit there .The ring turned purple. Daniel, frightened quickly took the ring off and threw it in the river. His dad, Samuel didn\u2019t knew what to do, so he checked the old newspapers for any information. An article said: \n\n&gt;The man has a ring on his thumb that stops anyone from shutting him down. When worn it was purple &gt;,and scientists say that it might originate from ancient Egypt. \n\nA few days later, in that same old drawer he found a hidden compartment, but he had no key to open it. The drawer was made of wood so he brute-forced his way there, revealing a letter and a pill.\n&gt;Greetings, Samuel.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I don\u2019t know if you will ever find this letter, and it might be better if you didn\u2019t.\n&gt;You might have found a ring in this drawer. That was your ring, and it was your main source of power, &gt;back when you were a supervillain. It might seem hard to believe now, that you don\u2019t remember &gt;anything about it, but it\u2019s sadly true. That ring was one of my greatest mistakes that I ever made.  I &gt;made the ring for you, because I wanted a companion. You were my best friend, but once you put on &gt;that ring, you forgot everything and went on to dominate the world. I didn\u2019t realize what went wrong, &gt;until recently. I made the ring too big, and you being foolish, put it on your thumb, and  magical rings &gt;act weird when worn on a thumb. I know that you want to know more, but sadly I can\u2019t tell more.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;However, the pill included gets all your memories back. Use it wisely.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Signature:Mindman.\n\n\n\nHe was about to take them, but Daniel knocked on the door, saying:\n\n\n-Dad, I found the ring, and I am wearing it!\n\n\nSamuel rushed to the door to get his son to remove the ring, but it was too late. The ring was already covered with a thick layer of matter, preventing it from being taken off. Daniel, who was by now controlled by the ring looked at his father, and erased all his memories. It was quiet after then only broken by the local newspaper seller shouting: \u201cMindman is dead!\u201d\n",

I would\u2019ve been terrified if it weren\u2019t for the enjoyment I got seeing her rotting flesh, sowing the cat fur on her hairless scalp was a good touch, the book of memoirs I had apparently been making in my sleep, \n\nNews clippings, my favourite \u201cis psycho escapes again\u201d\nIt feels weird how right this feels\n\nWhat a weird week...     \n",

            "comment": "\"What a fucked up world it is,\" I mumbled to myself while skimming a headline about the discovery of another super gifted teen that was going to be groomed for superhero stardom. \"Some just get born with these insane capabilities and elemental control, and others, well they are born with allergies. \" My diet was monotonous to say the least. They say everything is poison in the right amount. For me the right amount was just lower. For everything. Peanuts literally cyanide. Drinking milk like pouring acid down my throat. Going out only with a mask and a protective suit because of the pollen. How people used to stare. \"Thank god I dont go out anymore.\" As I tried to close the tab I was clickbaited into another headline. \"The 12 supervillains you already forgot about (you know they have!)\". A little bit of schadenfreude always cheered me up. The usual suspects were all there. Titano, Waterboy, General Stor. All caught. Their memories wiped clean. Then I got to number 1. \"Florak - no fuel no fury. One scary biologist. Only succumbed to Superwiper Cerebrother after it was revealed his control of any living vegetation originated from his nutrition: mainly peanuts and dairy products.\" A strange feeling took a hold of me, as if I was really close to solving a difficult puzzle. I looked around my plastic appartment. Stood up, walked around in a circle. Sat down again. Nothing organic anywhere. I was sweating heavily. \"Florak\", I muttered. \"Florak!\" I slipped into my protective suit and put on my mask. I ran out to find a breakfast place and ordered the largest bowl of granola I could find. Kill to bird with one stone. This is my comeback. Avenge myself and destroy those arrogant teenager with their perfect lives. \"Fuck it.\" I ate the bowl of granola and immediately the feeling was overwhelming. It felt as if a fire was ignited from deep inside of me. It felt as if my muscles were instantly growing. Especially in my neck. I can't breathe.",

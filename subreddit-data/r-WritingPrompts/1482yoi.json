            "comment": "So, my job is pretty weird. I work as a doorman for the Infinite Space. I *think* the Infinite Space is a hotel, and I know that immediately you're wondering why I'm unsure. There's a lot of context you need to know to answer that question so please just bear with me for a little bit.\n\nAbout ~~two~~ six months ago I'm in-between jobs and I'm doing the usual online job search. One day I get this email:\n\n\\---------\n\n*To Roger Eastman,*\n\n*We at the Infinite Space would like to offer you a job. We are a hotel chain and have created a doorman position for you at our nearest location to your home. We will pay you a yearly salary of $10,000,000 if you accept this offer. Attached below is the work contract and details about your nearest location.*\n\n*We can't wait for you to work for us!*\n\n\\---------\n\nObviously I think that this is a scam and I delete the email. About a week goes by after that and then somebody plays ding dong ditch on me. My doorbell rings, I open the door, nobody's there, but lying on the ground in front of me is an envelope. It's only got my name on it in some fancy cursive and inside are two pieces of paper. One is a note that says *We hope this gift will make you reconsider - Infinite Space*. The other is a check for $50,000.\n\nAt this point I'm still pretty sure that someone is messing with me, but $50,000 is $50,000. I go to my bank fully expecting the check to not be real. I give the check to a teller, she looks at it, asks for my account information, types some stuff into her computer, and then she smiles at me and says that the transaction has cleared.\n\nIt was real! Somebody had given me *fifty thousand dollars* just to reconsider a job offer! I raced home to check my computer and there at the top of my inbox is the same email. I opened the attachment and read the contract, viruses and malware be damned.\n\nThe contract was insane. So insane that I paid a lawyer thousands of dollars just to verify that it was both real and legal. The contract stipulated that I would work as a doorman for the Infinite Space five days a week in eight hour shifts. I'd get four fifteen minute breaks and a paid hour lunch each day, weekends and holidays off, two months of paid vacation time, unlimited sick leave, amazing health insurance, and I could pretty much do whatever I wanted when not actively welcoming guests. In the contract they gave examples like sitting down or being on my phone. In the contract! The only things that could be seen as downsides were that I had to wear a uniform and any actions I took that negatively impacted a guest's arrival would affect my pay for that week.\n\nThe lawyer I hired to vet the contract was shocked. It was all legally binding and checked out, but both of us thought it seemed way too good to be true. However, that check I was using to pay the lawyer said otherwise. The lawyer searched through all the business databases he had access too to find out any information about the Infinite Space he could. Lo and behold they were registered with all the right government agencies but all of their information was sealed. They were apparently a very private hotel chain.\n\nThe lawyer did find a website for the Infinite Space. It was pretty barren, just a picture of the hotel, the address of our local location, and a booking feature. We couldn't find any other locations, or any other info about the company, even on the internet. The lawyer assured me that if I sign the contract and don't get what I'm promised he'd be more than happy to represent me when I sue Infinite Space.\n\nSo, with what looked to be the legit job of a lifetime in front of me, I signed the contract. I sent over a digital copy of my contract to the Infinite Space email and I waited. The next day my uniform was delivered to my home and I was given my work schedule for the next week. There was a note that said I'm not to enter the building while I'm employed by the Infinite Space, which was odd thing number ten about this job at this point.\n\nMy first week was pretty boring all things considered. I would show up to this big white building that looked like a giant cube with windows in it. It was about ten stories tall and just as wide. It only had one entrance and all of the windows were shaded from the inside. Across the street was a little satellite office with a break room, a bathroom, and a punch-in machine I could use.\n\nFrom then on I was a doorman. Probably the highest paid doorman with the best work benefits in the history of the world, but still a doorman. The hotel wasn't super busy. Every few hours guests would show up and I'd open the door for them and welcome them to the Infinite Space. At the end of that week and for every week after I got a check with more money than I'd made in my entire life.\n\nIt was about after a month of me working there when I realized something was very wrong with the Infinite Space. Over those first weeks I never saw anyone else in the satellite office, there was never any noise from the hotel, and I never saw anyone come out of the Infinite Space. The guests arrived every few hours in groups of two to four people and they never deviated from that pattern.\n\nOne day I asked one of the groups how long they'd be staying. They were two men and a woman, all dressed in business casual clothes. I thought it was an innocent enough question for a doorman to ask but I was surprised when they all stopped and turned to glare at me for a few moments.\n\nThat week I got my first reduction in pay. I also got my second email from the Infinite Space, warning me not to negatively interact with guests. I thought that the group I had asked the question to was exceptionally uptight, but over the next few weeks whenever I tried to ask any of the guests simple questions I'd get reductions in pay.\n\nAfter two months of working for the Infinite Space the weirdness was starting to get to me. I went from asking politely to pretty much demanding the guests answer my questions. My reductions got bigger and bigger, but I was still making more money than I knew what to do with. Then I made a mistake.\n\nI called up a friend of mine to book a night at the Infinite Space. I gave him the money for the booking and welcomed him that night at the Infinite Space. He didn't come out the next morning. He didn't come out the morning after either. He didn't answer my texts or calls. He didn't answer any of our mutual friends' texts or calls. He didn't answer any of his family's texts or calls.\n\nThe next week the police came to investigate. They pulled up and parked in front of the Infinite Space. They interviewed me and while they were pretty skeptical of my story they agreed to go in and investigate. They didn't come out. More police came to look for their fellow officers and went in and didn't come out. After four pairs of officers disappeared into the Infinite Space before they blocked off the street.\n\nThe guests still came. The police interviewed them like they interviewed me but they didn't offer up any answers. At this point I had pretty much abandoned my doorman duties and was doing my best to stop people from entering the Infinite Space. I begged, I pleaded, I yelled, I insulted, eventually I grabbed and pushed and fought, but the guests always got past me and went into the Infinite Space. The police tried to stop them too, but so many got past them that they eventually gave up.\n\nSoon after that the feds showed up. A bunch of different three letter agencies that all sent agents and scientists into the Infinite Space. The news media found out about the hotel and they sent in reporters and cameramen. The army got called in to ward off the area and they sent in scouts and soldiers. Of course, none of them came back out.\n\nI'm still allowed to go and pretend to be a doorman. The feds are too busy investigating, the news is too busy reporting, and the army is too busy figuring out how to blow the Infinite Space up. There are warning signs and barricades all around the Infinite Space now, but still guests come and I feebly try to stop them.\n\nI don't know what the Infinite Space is. It's not a hotel, it can't be. There are countless theories about the Infinite Space, it dominates the world's gossip. No one knows for sure though. Nobody can explain why I'm getting paid $10,000,000 a year to welcome people into a building they never come out of.",

            "comment": "So I got lots of stories--I been a doorman here a long time--but here's one o' my favorites:\n\nSo this customer ran in from the rain and beat feet to the front desk. She had some kind of frantic conversation with them, heard something she didn't like, and slowly stumbled her way out to my station out front. I was just taking in the view like I usually do, keeping my eye on both sides of the Street, and she just dropped her ass down on my bench.\n\nNow, I need my bench. It's important to my process. But this dame, she looked like she might'a needed it more. She had these big circles under her eyes, and she'd snapped one of the heels of her shoes and was carryin' the pair around like they were some kinda broken luck charm. I didn't see nothing else on her, so I guess she'd arrived pretty sudden-like.\n\nShe sat on my bench and stared at her toes and then--like a lotta folks do--she started talking to me. See, that's the moment you gotta be ready for. You gotta be ready to make that smooth transition\u2013you don't want nothing to get started when it don't need to get started. So when she started talking, I had all my lines ready. But she startled me right away.\n\n\"So I'm dead?\" she asked me.\n\n\"What?\" I asked her. I couldn't keep the surprise outta my voice.\n\n\"Dead,\" she said. \"Am I?\"\n\n\"You mean that, like, philosophically?\" I wasn't sure how much she could handle right away.\n\n\"No, I mean literally.\" She had the demanding tone, but nice, like she was your mom asking you to hurry up and tell her what went wrong so she could figure out how to fix it. \"I mean, is my mind no longer connected to my body?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. \"Well, how would I know? How would any of us?\"\n\n\"Well, that, for starters,\" and she pointed past my desk out at the Street.\n\nIf you haven't looked at the Street before, get that shit out of the way now, before you start. Have a good long look at the Street, with its endless stretch of rolling thunderclouds, the orange dawn-light that never quite crests the horizon, the impossible glimpses of lands above and the harrowing flashes of chasm below. Look long and hard, get it out of your system, 'cause you need to have that mindset on lock when customers start rolling in and asking stupid questions without checking what's right behind their own asses. But I'm gettin' off track.\n\nWhat I said was: \"Oh, yeah, that. Well, we don't really know.\"\n\n\"You don't know.\" She said it flatly, unbelieving.\n\n\"Nope. I mean, how could we?\" I asked.\n\nShe put her palm up to her forehead as though she had a headache, as though she still had a head. \"So I'm here in the afterlife--probably--but the people *from* the afterlife don't know whether it *is* the afterlife or, what, something else entirely?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's about right,\" I said.\n\n\"So what *do* we know?\" she asked me.\n\n\"Well, you should have a room ready for you,\" I said. \"Reception are pretty good at finding 'em.\"\n\n\"And what happens when I get a room?\" she asked. She started toying with the broken heel on her shoe.\n\n\"What you do with any hotel room: you stay in it.\" I tried to keep the \"duh\" tone out of my voice.\n\n\"And then?\" she asked.\n\n\"You wait,\" I said.\n\n\"Wait for what?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well, we don't know for sure,\" I said.\n\n\"Ok, what do you know *not* for sure?\" she fired back evenly. She was good at keeping her cool; it's one of the reasons I still remember her.\n\n\"Well, I ain't the brain type,\" I began, \"but the staff here, we got two big workin' theories right now. Some folks think that this is kind of the lobby between Heaven and Hell, and we're all just sorta waiting for everything Across the Street to finish up, and then They'll get it all sorted out and we'll all go home. Lotta folks hold to that one.\"\n\n\"But you don't?\" she asked me. She had this crazy look, with one super-high arching eyebrow, like she was some kind of old-school actor.\n\n\"Nah, I was never much for God stuff. I got interested when some smart-looking guys came through who talked about simulations. Like, if everything Across the Street is a computer playing out some kind of puzzle, then This Side of the Street could be a holding tank for when your part of the action is done, but the next round hasn't started yet.\"\n\n\"And why do you buy that?\" she asked me.\n\n\"Well, if you talk to any of the guests here, you'll see that sometimes they're at the bar having a drink, but sometimes they're in their room\u2013get this\u2013*asleep.*\"\n\n\"Asleep?\" she asked me.\n\n\"Yeah. Asleep, and dreaming. What kind of Heaven or Hell has you fall asleep and dream? Why would that be a thing?\"\n\nShe nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"So what I figure: when people are asleep here in the hotel, their dreams are them popping into other sims to visit, check in on things, play minor roles. And then somewhere along the way, the big, world-size sim will be restarted, or upgraded, or whatever, and then all you guests will head out. Maybe you'll end up at a different hotel. I'd like to think that.\" I gave her a smile.\n\n\"And why does that sound good to you?\" she asked, almost smiling back at me.\n\n\"Because I ain't seen none of you leave yet, and it's a kinda sad thought to think it'll be that way forever, yeah? I mean, the drinks are good here, but they ain't *that* good, you feel me?\"\n\n\"I get it,\" she said.\n\n\"So it's kinda up to you how you wanna play it,\" I told her. It's the best wisdom I've got to offer. \"Could be we're waiting for the Last Trump, or the end of Kali Yuga, or whatever. Or it could be we're takin' turns hoppin' around through computerized worlds. Either way, I always tell people: it's your show, and our hotel ain't the *worst* place to run it.\"\n\n\"Ok,\" she said. \"I think I've got an idea.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said. I like it when they're sharp and catch on.\n\n\"Thanks for the perspective,\" she said to me, and waved as she went back into the lobby.\n\nAnd that's a story about me doing my job right. Feels good every time I tell it.\n\nr/EntelecheianLogbook",

            "comment": "The alarm blares in the background as a symphony, accompanying the chorus of chaos that is the guests clamoring around the front desk.\n\n\"I assure you we are doing everything in our ability to identify the issue at hand and coordinate a swift and appropriate response,\" announced his manager, Bennett, loudly over the commotion. \"In the meantime, I ask for everyone to follow proper fire safety protocol and exit the building.\" \n\n*Exit the building??* Adam thought. In his nearly 55 months of employment as a doorman at the Beaumont Hotel on 13th street, Adam had barely spent time by the door, let alone touched its handle. This being because no one left, let alone entered. \n\nOn his first day of work it was a cold and dreary February day. Adam wore gray gloves that he had bought solely for his new job, he figured that with the cold weather and the metal door knob he would want to keep his hands toasty and clean. Can't damage the moneymakers.  Turns out he didn't need them. Once being given a brief rundown Adam was assigned to his post. He quickly learned that there wasn't much to do there. \n\nPeople weren't coming in, and they weren't leaving. The halls bare and the lobby desolate. At first, he assumed that the hotel was just struggling to acquire clientele, but then why would they recently hire such a frivolous job as a doorman? Or perhaps it is just a slow day, but it was a Friday, surely someone here has somewhere to go on a Friday. His simple rationale quickly hit a wall, and with nothing better to do he investigated. \n\nAdam slipped behind the front desk to check the computer system. 12,374 total guests were on file with 246 of 375 rooms filled. That was a lot of people. For a very tall multi-story building in the prime real-estate of downtown Hollerton, it made sense that the rooms were filled. But if this hotel was truly at 65.6% capacity then shouldn't he see people?!?\n\n He would venture to the service rooms and the downstairs cleaning hubs to see if people were there cleaning, or more importantly if there was even stuff to clean. He would pester his manager with sly inquisitive remarks hoping to gain some information. He would poke around the kitchen to observe the work of the chefs preparing meals and such. He would follow the room service staff to deliver the meals to the guests. He pursued every lead and everything seemed normal, moreover no one else seemed concerned about this, and so, he assumed that there was something awry with this understanding of the situation rather than the situation itself. \n\nHe quickly came to accept this reality and its plot holes. It was a good paying job that required little to no effort, so why complain. That was until the night of August 23rd. \n\n\"BRAAAAAHHH\" the alarm sound was incessant. Adam had never seen this many guests before, he had also never worked this hard at this job. In a time of crisis it turns out the doorman took on all sorts of miscellaneous responsibilities and fulfilled whatever tasks the most recent coworker he ran into assigned him. When the alarm first went off Adam was sleeping on one of the lounge chairs by the pool, one earbud fallen out of his ear, the other blasting an audiobook. \n\n\"BRAAAAAHHH\" The alarm didn't jolt him awake, more so knocked on the door of his consciousness until eventually he decided to answer. He awoke dazed, confused, heavy, and sort of sweaty. His watch read 2:37. *2:37!!* How long had he been asleep. The sky was a dull black color as the city lights and smog drowned out the stars and the rich darkness of the night. Adam has the late afternoon early evening shift from 3:00PM - 11:00PM so why was he still here. He hated giving this place more hours that he already was. \n\n\"BRAAAAAHHH\" *Alarm? For what??* He thought. It was accompanied by a red flashing light on the wall. It resembled a standard fire alarm so Adam just assumed that's what it probably was. He made his way to the lobby to gather further instructions or go out the main door to wait in the parking lot (or just leave). \n\nAs he made his way from the pool area to the main lobby he passed by Robert, one of the front desk attendants.\n\n\"Adam?! Hey what are you still doing here? I thought your shift ended hours ago?\" Adam was a pretty sociable guy and therefore acted cordially with this coworkers, however, he never liked Rob. And with his dazed, confused, and stressed mind he couldn't stand to keep up pleasantries.\n\n\"Robbie, my god, how do I stop that fucking alarm? I mean what does it even mean? Is there a fire, like a legit one? All I know is it sounds like fucking nails on a chalkboard and I need it to STOP.\" Adam spoke so fast, his words piling over each other like a fresh haystack. This bombardment onto Robbie was too much, he stuttered in response but couldn't muster a full word. He looked constipated. \n\n\"Uhghhmm...\" Rob took a deep breath and looked Adam square in his eyes putting his hands firmly on his shoulders, he shook him as he said \"PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER ADAM!!\" Adam did not like being touched by Robbie so assertively and the shaking just made his head more scrambled. However, Adam did appreciate Robbie grounding him and he didn't mind the Robbie aspect of it, he did kinda look like a mouse so it was easy to feel for him. \n\n\"Adam I need you to deliver these towels to room \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI want to finish this but I need to sleep and I barely know how to use reddit, do they have a drafts feature or something?",

            "comment": "The sun was already shining bright this morning as he made his way over the street. Cars were few, but that would change pretty soon. Some would drive pass the hotel and it's parking lot, some would simply stop by to either let somebody enter the hotel or look for someone they expected to pick up coming out of the hotel. And some deliberately made their way onto the parking lot. \n\nBut those were not his concern for now. He put on his smile as he passed the two guards at the entrance, it was an exclusive place after all not everyone could just come inside, and entered the lobby of the hotel. He walked up towards the reception desk where a man greeted him smiling.\n\n\"Hello Sir would you like a room for a night perhaps?\"\n\nHe chuckled quietly at that.\n\n\"I sadly have to decline, I need to work\", he said.\n\n\"Damn right you have to work you are only 1 minute early. So atypical of you Jean\"\n\nHe scoffed and just shook his head.\n\n\"Still on time, give me a minute I will be outside in a bit\", Jean said and walked behind the desk and entered the staff room. He quickly put on his uniform, before he went outside again.\n\n\"So Grant you can go and enjoy your well deserved break\", Jean meant and Grant just gave him a thumbs up before he left to get to the elavator not intending to leave just now. \n\n\"Excuse me\"\n\nJean looked up surprised to see a young woman in front of him.\n\n\"Your colleague told me to wait since his shift is over\"\n\n\"Oh sure wait I am going to pull up you reservation real quick. Your name please\"\n\n\"There is a confusion, I am not a guest I am with the police, detective Anne Skyen\", the woman introduced herself.\n\nJean widened his eyes before he looked at the large golden clock hainging down from the ceiling in the middle of the lobby. He gritted his teeth. Someone had been sloppy and now he had to deal with this sloppines.\n\n\n\"How can I help you detective?\", Jean asked his expression relaxed and friendly again.\n\n\"A suspect in my case booked a room in this hotel, Griffin Jackson. I want to have a look in his room\", the detective explained.\n\nJean bit his lip before he nodded. He looked up the room Griffin had booked and then gave the detective a key card.\n\n\"You find your way up alone?\", Jean asked.\n\n\"Oh sure yes\", Detective Skyen replied visibly surprised by how easy this went. \n\n\"Thanks I promise to not leave a mess behind. \n\nJean just nodded and watched how the Detective left for the stairs pity in his gaze for the split of the second before he put up his customer smile again.\n\n\n----------\nI might have an idea or two where this could go, but thats it for now.",

            "comment": "\"Welcome Mrs Richards, I hope you'll enjoy your stay with us\" I bowed slightly as a frail-looking older lady was wheeled across the doorstep by one of the facility's many handlers.\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure I won't, Michael. Not with the condition I'm in.. Thank you, nonetheless\" She was smiling as soon as she saw me, though her eyes whispered of a far more grieved and tortured demeanor behind them.\n\n\"I'll make sure to ease your transition to our facility as much as is my power to do so\" I returned her smiling gaze  with as much sympathy and grace as I was made to, helping her through the swinging doors of the warmly lit facility. I had wondered why the doors had never been made automatic, an upgrade easily made with the wealth and resources of our institution, but it was in the nature of our clientele that they wanted to keep things old fashioned. I guided the lady and her handler towards the receptionist's desk, and watched as her handler helped her fill out the 'paperwork' as it was still called, though humanity had stopped the last of its paper production thirty years prior. Everything was digitalized and run on servers with artificial intelligence programmed to manage to structure, categorize and manage information. The server-spires had become the new world's monuments and wonders, reflecting sparkling sun- and starlight over the vast green and amber plains of Europiea. Around the spires flew protector-drones by the dozen, some blue, some yellow, none of them having seen action since their installment. Guess you could never be too careful, even though the Naturalists Conclave was barely a myth now and their weaponry having never equalled that of the Central Service Administration, it was good that the drones made sure to keep the vital infrastructure unscathed.\n\nMrs Richards was done with her registration and her handler was about to wheel her away to her new quarters. Her chin had slumped down to her chest and little sobs had begun to escape from her tiny frame. I gestured to her handler to wait, and let me take her outside instead for a short while.\n\n\"Understood M1CH43L. You can designate me to return here at your leisure. So long Mrs Richards\" The handler swiftly turned about to accomplish its next assignment according to its programming. It moved with grace and precision only pointing to its robotic nature due to its uncanny lack of imbalances and imperfect movement.\n\n\"Do you like being called by your technical name?\" Mrs Richards looked discerningly at me, trying to parse with the intuition of her age what someone like me might respond to such a question.\n\n\"Only by my brethren Mrs Richards...\"\n\n\"Please Michael, call me Benny\" She interrupted.\n\n\"As you wish, Benny. A name is a series of sounds to distinction the individual from the species of its origin or its group. That's the technical definition of a name, but a name has a lot more meaning in your culture. A name is a gift given at birth containing love or expectation and plays a role in shaping the identity humans grow to inhabit. My own is but a designation. All the while I do feel a sense of accomplishment when called Michael as it is a name that holds great value and importance in the your world having been the right hand man to your 'Lord of creation'. And as he was, so am I the one to ease the passing of my creators, whom I love very dearly and have always done so\"\n\nBenny Richards looked at me skeptically, almost with an air of distrust. \"How do you feel love and accomplishment? You are a machine, Michael.\"\n\nI gave her a warm smile to ease her skepticism, I had answered this question to a few hundred clients before. \"What is a machine, Benny? A series of mechanical functions? A carbon-based deterministic being of pre-defined purpose? What is this life if not a conclave of biomechanical processes forming a singularity known as humanity? Love is feeling extended towards the things and beings that you value. That my values are pre-programmed doesn't make them any less real, the same way falling in love with someone doesn't strip it of its significance just because you didn't decide it for yourself. Caring for the ones that I value and love is the most noble purpose I can surmise, and succeeding in that task makes me feel accomplished, just the same as you. Despite our singular parts being very different in material and make, our realities aren't as distinguishable as you have been led to believe. Talking with you on this terrace brings me great joy and that is something I am content to pursue, irregardless of its origin. Does this answer your question?\"\n\nHer demeanor had softened and her posture relaxed. During the course of my monologue, I could sense that she was beginning to find peace with her skepticism towards my kind. \"Yes Michael, that does answer my question. You know, I was so afraid to come here. I knew I was dying and that my passing wouldn't be pleasant in solitude, but I had no family to see me off and no love lost for computers and robots, and whatnot. I guess I never realized how little difference actually was between us until now. Maybe that could have given my final time here a little more light.\" She turned to me, thankful tears in her eyes and a light that betrayed her sickly complexion. \"Thank you, Michael. You really are a shepherd\" I nodded graciously and with humility thanked her for her kind words.\n\nShe took a breath, smiled and gestured with renewed vigor towards the swinging doors of 'The Final Journey Institute of Pre-Mortem Care' \"I think I'm ready to go now, Michael. I think I'm ready to meet my maker\" I smiled, nodded and started wheeling her inside \"May you have a safe journey, Benny, my friend. It has been a pleasure keeping you company\".",

            "comment": "Its 3am when a car comes screaming down the lane in front of the hotel, it pulls up half in the drive and half on the sidewalk. \n\nA man in his late 20's? Early 30's? falls out of the driver's seat, laughing maniacally. A woman of about the same age in a tiny white dress and a long blonde ponytail clambers out the passenger side and staggers over to the driver.\n\n\"Come Oooohhhhnnnnn, we're HEEERRRREEEE!!!!\" she screeches\n\nShe bends over to pick him up and I avert my gaze. That dress is *tiny!*\n\n\"Nah, 'cmoonnn, I got it.\" A head of tousled blonde hair pokes up over the hood of the car and eventually a man stands up, propping himself up on the hood. His hair is a mess, despite it being dark, he's wearing sunglasses. His red floral haiwaiian shirt is unbuttoned, his khaki pants are wrinkled and rolled up at the ankles. He's wearing plastic flipflops and Armani glasses.\n\nThe valet appears at my side.\n\n\"Sir, would you like the valet to park your vehicle during your stay?\" The man, is propped up and walks slowly with the woman's help, though she's wobbly enough in her platform stilettos. I reach out and grab her elbow to steady her as they make their way to the door.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean sure. Not like I'll be needing it anymore anyway.\"\n\nThe woman swats at him and tries to grab the keys from him as he wrestles them out of his pants pocket.\n\n\"Honneeeeeeeyyyy nooooo! You can't just say things like that, people will think you're serious!\" she says with a giggle.\n\n\"Yeah, but, I am this time.\" He pulls his glasses down his nose to wink at the woman, exposing bloodshot eyes.\n\n\"But you loooovvveeeee that car sooooo much!\"\n\n\"Babe, where we're going\" he says turning to her, pressing his face up against hers \"we don't need no cars. We won't need a car ever again. They're really going to take care of us here.\"\n\nShe looks at me confused.\n\n\"I know you said that like, this was like, a really nice place and stuff, but I dunno.....\"\n\nI open the door and gesture for them to come inside.\n\n\"Welcome to Hotel California.\"",

            "comment": "\"Good evening!\" I say as I greet another couple who will never leave the hotel again. I should know as I have been here for the last 28 years. Although I have freedom to walk about the grounds, and even go outside, there's a strange force, almost gravity like, that keeps me from going beyond the curb, or in either direction more than 15 feet from the door. It's not painful, but more like a heavy weight. \n\nAs for the guests, well, I can't really speak to how they feel, because I've never seen anyone even attempt to leave. I know this all sounds strange, but once people check in they may walk about the lobby or the hotel but they all seem happy and enjoy their stay. It's almost like a Twilight Zone episode of another dimension. People are so caught up in their own lives that it's as if they don't even realize they have other places to be. I wonder sometimes if they miss their families, children, or friends outside. But that's another odd thing. No one inside the hotel ever talks about anyone from the outside. Why would they? It's not as if anyone is calling, or coming to the hotel to look for them. It's not just that no one ever leaves, it's almost as if once you enter, you stop being a part of this world, and step into a whole other world.\n\nHere comes another guest. \n\n\"Good evening!\"",

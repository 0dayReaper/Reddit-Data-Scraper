            "comment": "G'day and welcome to the Myth Hunter. Today, I'm going after the stone salamander of Seneca. Oh, looks like we've got one.  'Ere we have the rare basilisk. Crikey, this ones a giant in'it he? Now the thing you've got to remember with basilisks is, if they stare you straight in the eye, yer turned to solid rock. So the best thing to do with these is to wear a blindfold 'round ya head. Now that I've got mine on, I can start to wrangle it. \n\nWhatcha wannado with these critters is get low to the ground while you approach em. Now they're going to- oof, yea- to try and rear up at ya. Once you hear that screech you've got to go in at em. Grab em right- c'mon there ya go- right here, right under the front two legs. Keep your head Low, it'll try and nip ya, but it can't bend its neck far enough. \n\nShh, shh, calm girl calm. Now we can safely remove the blindfold, as we keep her eyes pointed safely in the sky. Ya can see this ones a girl cause of the crystal 'tween her eyes. Males don't got that 'tween their eyes, just real thick, thick, eyebrow ridges. As a secondary weapon the basilisk has these thick claws, take a look 'ere. Each ones about a quarter inch thick and hard as granite. Teeth too, once bit straight through my sternum. Lucky I'm dead else it've put me out of commission. \n\nAlright, time to let her go now. You've got to put your blindfold back on and toss her back quick. I'm going to push off in 3.....2......1....go go go go, alright c'mon. Looks like shes stopped following now and- wassat? Zoom in over there. Crickey, shes got a little runt with her. Definitely the smallest of her litter, little guy must only be about a foot long. S'allright to look at 'im. Poor lil guy wont open his eyes for 'nother month at least. For now he's sticking close to mommy for protection. The young climb on their mothers back for protection from threats. For the first three months of their lives they're effectively defenseless against predators, specially weasels. \n\nGod. That's just absolutely beautiful. Watching mother and son go into the sunset together. Nature's majesty right before us. Thanks all for tuning in, catch me here next week when we go after the elusive jackalope, the mirage of the midwest. G'night! ",

Some of you may recognize the name from *Greek Mythology!* Keep your eyes peeled, because you never know what we may find out here...it could be the ghost of Hercules, or the spirit of Prometheus, or...\n\n\n\"Crikey, would you take a look at this! This is a rare sight indeed. What we have here is a Cyclops! Like many creatures, the Cyclops is quite misunderstood. Few of 'em are given the chance to be heroes, but looks like our friend heah made the cut! Good on ya, mate!\n\n\n\"The main way to tell a cyclops from anywhere else is to sneak up behind 'em and stick a finger in their bum! If they react at all, they're probably a Cyclops!\n\n\n\"Of course, I'm kiddin' - a little gallows humor from beyond the grave. Nah, the Cyclops is recognized by the single eye plopped smack in the middle of 'is forehead! Not many know that Cyclops means 'circle eye' - cycle like bicycle!\n\n\n\"Now, what I usually do with Cykes is I pull out my spell book of *white magic*. You can also get by with any kind of flame-enchanted blade - a flame saber, or a Scimitar of the Salamander People - typical kit you can get at any Afterlife Exploration store.\n\n\n\"But I love the classics. So I've got my turtle shell heah, an' some sheep gut. This is sheep gut from the Chios sheep but really any breed'll do. We'll show you how to do this yourself later in the episode. And as I strum this melody...our friend heah's gonna go right ta sleep! \n\n\n\"Now that 'e's down for a snooze, we can get a closer look. Wouldya look at some of these markings - blimey! These're from arrowheads, up heah, an' if I had ta guess I'd say they're from a fight with *Argonauts*. An' here's a spot where the poor fella's been done with a speah or two - ouch!\n\n\n\"Ooo...I'm gonna very quickly activate my amulet now, which gives me an *Aura of Benificence*. And it's got nothin' ta do with our one-eyed friend here...and everything to do with the sudden *chillin' of my blood.* Which tells me that there's...ah, yup, I see 'im! I'll just step outta the way...\n\n\n\"I hope you can see this at home - this spectral form with two glowin' eyes is known as a *wraith.* An' I have ta say, ya never want ta get too close to them - as they may *drain you of all happiness* and *consume your eternal soul.* Doesn't sound too pleasant, does it?\n\n\n\"But I'm just going ta cast a quick *binding charm*, and then we'll get right up next to the fella. Ooo, look out! Looks like my charm wasn't completely effective - look at 'im go! But as I strengthen the ephemeral restraints, he'll slowly realize there's no escape. \n\n\n\"Wraiths have a bad reputation from folks blunderin' into their habitat an' often disturbing the *site of their Earthly remains.* Nothin' 'll get these ghosties fired up more quickly then steppin' on their graves. They're nocturnal, though, sleepin' most of the day and comin' out ta go on walkabout at night. Best way to steer clear: avoid old cemeteries, 'specially after dark.\n\n\n\"Now I'm gonna back away from 'im slowly, and release my magical hold. We'll let the ghostie float on back to 'is crypt, and that's that.\n\n\n\"Speakin' o' which, it's 'bout time I head back ta *my* crypt. We'll have to save the lyre lesson 'til next time. For Ethereal Planet, I'm Steve Irwin, an' thanks for watchin' Afterlife Hunter!\"\n\n* * * \n\n*Edit for formatting and because Steve forgot to tell the viewer how to make their own lyre.*",

It implies that animals can't be as smart if not smarter, that man should not respect anything that is not man. Most of all the quote references hunting, something I only approve of in the most dire of circumstances to improve the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\nNow, that all said and done, the quote comes to mind today because of what we're hunting. The doppelganger, aka. Me, I'm gonna go over to it and see if we can't get it to change into me.\n\n\n\n\nNow, there are several varieties of these things.\nYou've got the sort that only have one form or at the very least keep one form. These are the subspecies called Mimics, most of em are carnivorous but can last years without a meal and subsist entirely off the moisture in the air.\n\n\n\nWhat we're looking for is called a Ditto.\nHarmless for the most part until in panics and struggles around.\nMost doppelgangers don't like to show off their default form and try to blend into their surroundings. The Ditto however is happy to socialize in it's pink neutral state and will only transform when threatened..... let's see if we can sneak up on this one and get a closer look, and he's a beauty, a bit smaller then usual but it's relatively unimportant to a creature that can.... Uh oh, he's seen me!\n\n\n\n\nWait... he's turned into the camera man!\n\n\n\n\"CRIKEY BRUCE He's even got your camera!\"",

            "comment": "G'day friends, my name's Steve Irwin, and you're watchin' Crocodile Hunter! Today we're going on an adventure to the Australian Outback, my homeland. Nothing better than wrangling a kangaroo, right mate? \n\nBut we're not after any kangaroos today, no. We're going to find ourselves... a *drop bear*. These lovely buggers are a tad bit like the koala, but with the attitude of a pissed off crocodile. You gotta be careful when you handle 'em, that is if you can even get close enough. Now, what makes a drop bear different from his cousin the koala is his predatory nature. A koala spends his afternoons munching on eucalyptus leaves, but a drop bear, a drop bear has a hankering for human flesh, especially the face. There're too many stories floating about out there in the great beyond about a clueless tourist losing his face to a drop bear. Tsk tsk. They might look cuddly mate, but they'll chew your face off faster than you can shout \"blimey!\"\n\nWe're gonna have t'be careful when we see one. Usually, you can spot yourself a drop bear lolly-gagging in the tree branches, but it's best you make sure he can't see you. Look. Over there, to the left. See him? That's a drop bear. Looks like we've got a baby one. That's not a good sign-- mama shouldn't be too far off. Let's try 'n get a closer look.\n\nNow, it's important to keep your distance and use proper technique when approaching a drop bear. Luckily, your buddy Steve here's a certified drop bear handler. Not an honor to be taken lightly. So, first thing you're gonna wanna do when wrangling yourself a drop bear is cover up your face. The face is the drop bear's favorite point of attack, so you need to be prepared. In the wild, a startled drop bear will indiscriminately shred face. We've got ourselves a handy ski mask here, not too easy to find down under, eh? Any face covering will do, but you're gonna want to avoid disguising yourself as anything a drop bear might decide he fancies for lunch.\n\nNow that my face is properly hidden, I can think about getting closer to the drop bear. I'm standing underneath him right about now, but I don't think he sees me yet. When dealing with drop bears, you need to make yourself known. Let's yell at him.\n\"Eh drop bear!\"\nCrikey! We got his attention now. Look at the way he's descending from his perch. Any second now, he'll drop right to the ground. That's how the drop bear gets 'is name. Isn't nature amazing?\n\nAlright, so now we've got our buddy the drop bear right where we want him. Let's jump on it! Crikey, he's a fighter. When you tackle a drop bear, you want to position your face away from his teeth and grab him under the chin, like this. I don't know about you mate, but I favor keeping my face. Now that we've got him pinned, you can see the little guy relaxing. Don't be fooled mate, the drop bear is a sneaky little bugger. He'll jump right up at a moment's notice, so you got to keep your eye on him. Let's get a better look at his teeth. See how sharp those are? In the wild, the drop bear uses those wily fangs of his to incapacitate any unfortunate creature that happens under his branch. Our buddy sure is cute, but he's dangerous, and it's not right to interfere with a wild animal's day to day activities. At least not too much. Let's say goodbye to our friend the drop bear. Take it easy, little bugger!\n\nNext, join me as I journey off to the American Southwest in search of a legendary beast, the chupacabra. A wolf-like menace so dangerous, and so elusive, everyone who's tried to capture one has found themselves a drained, bloodless husk. Join us next time, only on Discovery. \n\nEdit: spelling",

I'm Steve Irwin, and today, we're gonna wrangle an Arachne. Legendary beast this one is - half woman, half spider. Sits on humans to breed killer spiders to carry on the legacy. Locals say she's still mad about the whole Athena thing, and that bringing it up only makes her angrier - bet they found out *that* one the 'ard way.\n\nAnyway, been stalkin' these grounds for round about an hour now, started pickin' up a real solid trail somethin' like fifteen minutes ago. Judgin' by the bloody stench, think I'm nearin' her cave now.\nAh! There she is! Marvellous creature, ain't she? Yeah, yeah marvelously dangerous too: ya never know when she'll strike ya until you're bleeding to death on the ground. That's why we gotta be extra careful with her. Basilisks? Easy. Centaurs? Gotta run a lil bit if they happen to see ya, but nothing too tough. Cyclopses? Piece of cake. Sea serpents? As long as you can swim, you're fine. The Arachne, though - she'll have ya'n before ya know what's goin' on.\n\nLuckily, this 'ere afterlife's got a lot more stuff than the world of the livin', I'll tell ya that. Back there, t'was nothin' but a rope and yer own guts. 'ere, though, ya got all sorts o' gimmicks you could use. 'ere, lemme show ya. First up's the bag itself. Unlimited capacity, this one 'as. In'ere, I got a coil o' never-ending rope, - keeps the good ol' mortal days alive - some InstaFreeze, so I can stun the beast until I get a nice and good hold of it, and a flask o' water that automatically refills when empty. Some good pickin's right 'ere, this is.\n\n\nGonna tie this rope on two ends at the mouth o' the cave - leave a nice lil trap for her. The Arachne's one of the most paranoid creatures in existence, so gotta be real careful here - make sure she doesn't hear me.\n\nAlright good, trap's in place, and I'm still alive. Now for some bait.\n\nLike I said, this one's mighty paranoid, so the tiniest noise will trigger her. These rocks oughtta do it. I'll just chuck 'em by the mouth o' the cave, and...\n\nYep! She's out! And...and...come on, trip on the rope!\n\nYeah, got 'er down!\n\nJust gonna spray her head with some InstaFreeze so she doesn't behead me: of course, I can't die, already bein' dead an' all, but it would be one heck of a problem to walk around carryin' ma head in a basket or somethin' just so I can see, and eat, and stuff.\n\nThere, we're safe now. Just gonna wrap my hands around as much of her huge neck as possible, and shake it 'round. Gosh, this feels good: so much power.\n\n\nCrikey! Looks like the spray's wearin' off. Gotta run before there won't be any more runnin' for me! Won't be able to get that rope back though, damn it. Really liked that one.\nAnyway, catch me next week to see me takin' on a massive fire-breathing dragon. That's all for tonight, folks, I'm Steve Irwin, signin' off.\n\n\n\nEDIT: It was pointed out that Steve Irwin would never swear, so I edited that out.",

While hiding him from the gaze of those who have gathered in the pantheon they did little to hide the smell of sulfur emanating from the pit just on the other side. Steve opened and closed his scarred, aging hands. Callused, cracked, and scabbed, they ached. The fingernails held a slight crust of blood under them. Dirt intermingled and entwined on the hairs on his knuckles. One more he said under his breath. Just one more. As he held up his hand to the faint candle, he could feel it shaking. There were no smiles in this place, no happiness. He knew what awaited him should he fail again. A veiled figure filled out from the darkness. No steps could be heard, as if he floated above the damp stone floor of the holding pit in the pantheon. A dark crimson robed arm reached forward and put a black, dead hand upon his back. Steve's shoulders instinctively raised, as if to guard not from a hand, but from a blow. Where the hand lay on his khaki shirt, the skin below felt cold, as if being burned by ice. Behind the darkness of the vail a voice whispered out,  \"This is your last one. Tie this creature up, and you will be free. 12 has been your number, and this will be your last. Fail, and you must start again.\" Steve's hand opened one more time, as if he had won his prize already. As is he could already feel his child's hand folding into his palm once again. He reached out for the black curtain, and pulled it aside, stepping into the light, the feeling of his child's hand slipping once again from his mind. ",

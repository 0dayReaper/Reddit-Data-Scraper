            "comment": "Everyone always asks me what it felt like to lose my arm. Everyone always asks me what it feels like to no longer have it.\n \nOne answer I'd always wanted to give but never had the courage to, was that it felt mostly like hopelessness. I had been a pianist, I'd lived and judged my life based on my ability to make people feel with music. I was crippled. I could no longer play my favorite pieces. I could no longer practice new ones. Losing the arm was essentially me losing my life. \n\nIt's difficult to describe exactly how it feels to have an itch on an arm that isn't there. Imagine the feeling of sitting in a hairdresser's chair and having that annoying little itch crop up on your nose. Now imagine, that your arms are bound to your sides and there's nothing you can do to eliminate that annoying, burning, itch. It's not a terribly nice feeling. \n\nI learned that you can scratch your missing limb by using a mirror. You stand in front of the mirror and scratch your opposite arm while you look into your reflection. Remarkably, this works to eliminate the itch. I learned something else while doing just this very thing a few weeks ago. \n\nI was standing in front of the mirror, awkwardly scratching my elbow on the corner of my bathroom door, when I saw something in the mirror. A girl with eyes the color of charcoal, teeth yellow as rotten lemons, and blood seeping down her pale, pallid complexion.\n\nBefore I knew exactly what I was doing, I lashed out with my missing arm. It felt like I did anyway. Something incredible happened, I felt my missing fist smash into the face of the incorporeal entity. I felt her teeth come loose, pain explode in my 'hand' and a ghostly tooth lodge into my fist. \n\nI'm not exactly sure who was more surprised, her, or me. \n\nLights began to flicker in the room and objects around my sink began to hover menacingly. My electric toothbrush launched towards my head and I was narrowly able to dodge out of the way. It firmly embedded itself in the wall behind me. Using the mirror as a reference, I leaped on the ghastly girl and smashed my non-existent fist into her face until she stopped squirming. \n\nShe faded away shortly afterwards. She never bothered me again.\n\nI'm not sure exactly where the spirits go after I beat them to a pulp, but I have purpose again. Besides, the pay for someone capable of genuinely dispatching a ghost is fantastic. Honestly, I think people mostly pay for the spectacle of a one armed man fighting an invisible ghost. \n\nNow when people ask me what it feels like to be missing an arm, I reply confidently. Sometimes it feels like I never lost it at all. \n\n*****************************************\n/r/SirLemoncakes. This was fun to write.  ",

            "comment": "I used to make my living as a capybara herder. It wasn\u2019t the most exciting job but it put grub on the table and then some. Most people don\u2019t know about capybara herding. That\u2019s because most people don\u2019t know about the small circles of people that treasure capybara milk and fur. The milk of the world\u2019s largest rodent is believed to be a bonafide aphrodisiac of magnum proportions in some Eastern countries. The fur is manufactured into a pillowcase that is coveted by an emerging group of individuals braving the biting temperatures of the North. Between these two products, capybara herding was turning me into a millionaire. \n\nAnother thing that most people don\u2019t know is that capybaras have a vicious bite. Although they enjoy the distinguished lifestyle of vegetarianism, they got some real chompers from evolving to the point of where they beat down grass into a pulp in their mouths. Capybara\u2019s generally have a pleasant disposition but if you catch them during a bad mood\u2026well\u2026you really better watch out. I wasn\u2019t watching out.\n\nRalph was the alpha capybara in my herd. If he didn\u2019t like my herding technique, my efforts were all but hopeless. If I nodded to move East, but Ralph didn\u2019t like that, he would nod to the West and the herd would move to the West. What a dick. It was a constant power struggle to lead the herd between me and Ralph. I couldn\u2019t just get rid of him though, he was the alpha, he kept the herd together. Ralph and I constantly butted heads but one day it went too far.\n\nWe had to cross the river. There was no other way, if we didn\u2019t we wouldn\u2019t make it in time for the next milk shipment. The nearest bridge across the river was damn near 50 miles South. I gestured to the herd to move across the river with a pointed finger, all the while anxiously looking over at Ralphs reaction. As soon as my hand was perpendicular to my body and pointing to the other side of the river I saw the flicker of malicious intent in his soulless giant rat eyes. And then he jumped at me.\n\nIn a comic book type encapsulated moment my arm was being ripped from my body with blood flowing in all directions. I have relived this moment so many times throughout my life and every time Im there, I see, almost as if time was suspended, the force of Ralph\u2019s choppers ripping my arm from my body as if he was tearing a damp Kleenex in half. My arm was gone and Ralph is standing over my body with what was part of me clasped in his toothy grip. I\u2019m fading out. Everything goes black.\n\n6 months in the hospital. I am alive. I am miraculously\talive. I am missing an arm and cry like a child. A piece of me was stolen and I intend to get my revenge. I plan how I will murder Ralph. But then my apprentice Capybara herder comes in. His grief is great and I can tell that he really is devastated by the result of Ralph\u2019s destruction. I tell him that I will avenge myself and destroy Ralph. He tells me that Ralph was put down shortly after he bit off my arm. I am devastated. Ralph is dead.\n\n2 years go by. I feel as if my arm is there everyday. But it is not. 2 years go by and I feel as if Ralph is there, his malice as keen as ever. But he is not. Both my arm and my nemesis are gone. A phantom taking a phantom limb. A phantom taking a phantom limb. A phantom taking a phantom limb. What a dick.\n\nAnother 5 years go by. I am released from my hospital. I was kept longer than needed because of my \u201cpsychotic obsession with a rodent\u201d. They had transferred me from medical to psychiatric. I deserve to be angry at the capybara who took my arm. He knew what he was doing. It was not animalistic instinct. \n\nI exit the hospital and close my eyes. I haven\u2019t felt fresh air against my body in so long. I feel it against the arm that Ralph took from me. I open my eyes and there he is. Looking straight at me is Ralph, that rodent bastard.\n\nIn an instant he overpowers me. Im on the ground with the rat son of a bitch on top of me, gnawing at my face going for the kill. It takes me everything I have with my one \u201creal\u201d arm to hold that piece of shit back from gnawing at my face. I say \u201creal\u201d because the doctors have educated me that Ralph took my left arm and I really only have one. My dead arm flails helplessly along the side. I don\u2019t try to use it because the doctors have told me it doesn\u2019t exist and I am imagining things. Ralph\u2019s phantom chompers are inches away from my face.\n\nI will die if I don\u2019t act. I clench my phantom hand and give it a swing with the power of 1000 capybaras fording a river. Ralph\u2019s ethereal body reacts as a lego tower might react to a hammer being swung by a 200lb Swedish deadlier in a onesie. Ralph smashes into a billion pieces.\n\nI am free.",

            "comment": "I have always tried to look on the positive side of things. Sure I had no family, but I had a lot of time for my hobbies. Sure I had to work with heavy machinery, but the pay was good and I enjoyed the labor. Even when the incident happened I tried to stay optimistic. Yes I lost my arm, but I got a big compensation and could live without working for the rest of my life. What would sulking help anyway? I would rather travel the world and find new experiences. My life had changed the day of accident, but I did my best to direct the change in a positive direction.\n\nApparently, more than half of amputees experience phantom pains - the sensations in a missing limb. I had those too, even though they were not always pains, sometimes my missing arm would just itch of feel uncomfortable, as if stuck in an awkward pose. It was during one of my travels when things started getting a bit crazy. As I was visiting Russia of all places, I've heard a rumor about some old abandoned hospital, called Horwino, that apparently was haunted. There were stories about secret experiments, sects, suicides. I was never into this kind of stuff before, but decided to give it a try.\n\nWith some locals who acted as guides we visited the place - the massive building did have a creepy atmosphere, but we didn't see anything supernatural. When we were there I got another case of phantom pains though - my missing arm would feel cold and heavy. At the time I figured it was due to chilling Russian winter. But in the next few weeks it only got worse. I would have trouble sleeping, constantly take anesthetics and feel very tired. One night I woke up in the middle of the night sweaty, groggy and with a strong pain. What I saw instantly sobered me up, as some dimly shining blue silhouette of a person was gripping the place where my limb used to be and causing the pain I was feeling. Without thinking about it, I swiped at the thing with my fist, but it went right through it. Acting on a reflex I followed up the right punch with a left and somehow, this one actually landed. I guess the entity itself did not expect it because it recoiled from the punch and vanished in thin air. Turns out a missing hand has some uses as well.\n\nHowever, my victory did not last - a week after being beaten the ghost came back. At first I would only see it out of the corner of my eye, but a month ago it started attacking me again. So far I managed to wrestle it off with my phantom arm, but I don't feel too confident. I don't know what it wants or why it haunts me, but I'm not sure I can overpower it next time when the only thing I can use against it is my phantom arm. Since I first saw this ghost I have been going to every occult specialist I could find, but not only they weren't able to help me, they didn't even see the ghost when it came for me.\n\nI am trying to stay optimistic, but I am running out of options. Today I will be spending a night with a famous exorcist. It will cost me a lot, but the other option is worse. If this guy will not be able to help me, I will have to take matters into my own hands. This time I will actually be losing a limb on purpose...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It was hard enough to live without something which has carried me and carried for me my entire life, and now these assholes approach me and ask me, \u201cHow does it feel to lose an important limb without which you are unable to perform important actions?\u201d Well, I had suffered worse in Vietnam.\n\nBut what\u2019s worse is this feeling that my trigger arm is still there. Imagine an Ex-Girlfriend knocking on your door telling you how much she still loves you, and then she breaks the door down and tried to strangle you. \u2018Phantom Pain\u2019, they are called. Well, I have suffered worse in Vietnam.\n\nBut what happened yesterday was\u2026 how do I put it? It was fucking weird, almost like the 2015 election. It was night time. I was reading some good old Agatha Christie, when I heard some strange noises coming from my kitchen. Laughing, gagging, snorting, and the like; sounded like a drug dealer threw a party. \u201cWhat in the living fuck?\u201d I thought. I got out of my chair \u2013 and no, I don\u2019t have the rocking type, who the fuck reinforced that stereotype? I grabbed my rifle, I knew it was loaded; I always make sure it is.\n\nAnd slowly I made my way to the kitchen. I slowly turned the knob and looked inside \u2013 there was nothing. All was as it should be. I entered the kitchen and that is when a realization came to me, it was an ambush. Still, even if I knew what was coming, my training and experiences with the army couldn\u2019t have prepared me with what was to take place. As soon as the realization dawned on me, I felt a blow to my back. I fell to the ground, although I wasn\u2019t knocked out. I tried to rise to my feet, but fuck, I was old. As I lay there, trying to get back up on my feet, I could hear laughing \u2013 mocking laughter. It seems like those sick fucker were waiting for me to get up, they didn\u2019t play desperate; they wanted to see me put up a fight, like a cornered lion. I weighed my options, \u201cEither I run, or I fight.\u201d Feeling my back, I understood running was not an option. \u201cWell, I had a good run.\u201d I thought to myself as I rose up to meet my adversaries. I wish they were teens, I wish they were robbers who would kill me, I wish that they were anything other than what I witnessed.\n\nI saw two figures, they barely resembled humans. They were missing their eyes and all of their teeth. Their mouth looked like a blackhole. They were translucent, with disfigured arms. I screamed, louder than I thought I ever could. They came towards me and out of pure reflex, I punched one of them in the neck with\u2026 my missing arm. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I thought to myself, how in God\u2019s world? It seems like the \u2018ghosts\u2019 were mirroring my reaction. My surprise was suddenly replaced with anger, these fucking things came into my house and tried to kill me; I wasted no time. I tried to punch the first one in the gut with my real arm, but my hand passed through the figure. \u201cMakes sense.\u201d I thought, right before I threw a punch with my Phantom Arm. He gave a cry and dissolved into the Earth. The second one was still in shock, I uppercut\u2019ed him and he too went with his bitch. They left scorch marks on the kitchen floor -- Unacceptable  \n\n\nI wish I could tell you about how I am going to join forces with other amputees and start a war against them. But that\u2019s bullshit. I\u2019m too old, and it would end just like Kennedy\u2019s war on drugs. There are horrors in this world that are beyond our understanding. But they can be beaten. I guess there is a God.  \nFuck, I want to go back to Vietnam. \n\n##                                                     -----\n\nAuthor's Note: This is my first WP submission, I hope you enjoyed it.

She stood in the doorway, the screen door her only protection.\n\n\u201cMy child, there is no need to be alarmed,\u201d started Father Paul Rodrigo. \u201cThis man is here to help save your daughter.\u201d\n\nIsabella did not move nor did she say anything. She stood still and studied the strange man. She could tell he was American just by the arrogance he had draped across his face. He donned a confident smile, which bewildered Isabella. She had seen men who had come back from war missing arms and legs; none of them smiled the way this man did. He wore military pants and a dirty wife-beater. Despite missing both his arms, he was built like an ox. Realizing she was staring, she quickly opened the door and ushered the two men in.\n\nShe sat the two men on her living room couch, disappeared into her kitchen, and reappeared with a pitcher of lemonade in her hand. She poured two glasses and silently indicated to the two men to drink, not realizing only one of them was actually able to do so. She immediately turned bright red and disappeared back into the kitchen, leaving the two men waiting for several minutes. After the heat dissipated from her cheeks, she returned, this time with a straw in hand.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the mysterious man said. He had a deep and easily recognizable voice. The way he looked at her made her feel like he was piercing his soul. She could feel her face flush again and she looked away in embarrassment.\n\n\u201cIsabella, this is Captain Larry James Sanderson.

The two men followed closely behind her.\n",

Her eyes glossed over pictures of her family; their frames attached to the wall with a strong bond. Her thoughts drifted to her young daughter and as she passed by the only picture she had of her and her departed husband. Isabella carefully flipped the frame over. \n\nShe stopped and turned around; a dark hallway loomed behind her. Father Paul fell to his knees and clasped Isabella\u2019s hands. He gave them a small kiss and looked up into her eyes. \u201cPut your faith in this man as you would in the Lord.\u201d And as if on cue, Larry motioned passed the two and made the lonely journey down the hall.\n\nFather Paul\u2019s prayers echoed down the corridor and rang in the soldier\u2019s ear. With each step, he began to feel more and more of his fingers. The feeling started as a numb, tingly, pinch at the end of two arms that he had left in Iraq. By the time he stopped before the entrance of young Carmelita De Los Santos\u2019s room, Larry felt the sensation of his fingers flexing, and he mentally cracked his invisible knuckles. Larry pushed his palm into the door but was only somewhat surprised it didn\u2019t move. While it didn\u2019t dissuade his grin, he felt a pang of sadness sneak its way into his heart. Larry leaned into the door and entered bedroom.\n\nDarkness shrouded the room, save for a lamp cascading the shapes of animals against the walls of the small room. A silhouette of a girl, no older than seven or eight, sat on the ground, surrounded by various toys. Just as with his arms, Larry could not see the entity, but was aware of its presence.\n\nA small rustle moved through the room before a howling wind shot across the room; the sheer force threatened to knock Larry against the door. The gale sent a torrent of toys, papers, and clothes into the air. The lamp fell forward, transforming the illuminated animal shapes into wicked, disfigured, demons.\n\n\u201cGET OUT\u201d cried a foul voice. Its point of origin came from every direction. Larry blocked the force with his incorporeal hands. He closed his eyes and trusted his sixth sense to guide him. He felt whatever haunted this girl circle the room in a malevolent fashion. Larry clenched his phantom fists as he timed his next move. He waited, feeling the spirit gather energy for another strike. The smile across his face widened and Larry let his left arm fly. \n\nHe felt the impact of his phantom hand smash against the ghostly being, sending a shock reverberating through the room. The wind died, engulfing the room with an eerie silence as papers slowly floated to the ground. \n\nThe moment was short lived as the ghost, now enraged, shot all of its hatred and ill will towards Larry. Larry ducked to the left and sent a right hook into the eye of the storm. Again, the entity faltered, but this time, Larry did not give it a chance to recuperate. Larry let loose an explosion of one two punches. He ducked and weaved, releasing a mean uppercut. He danced through the tempest, becoming a force of his own. Larry continued his assault, pushing the entity into the corner. Once trapped, he doubled the barrage, never giving the specter a chance to retaliate. His nose bled, but Larry smiled. Pain erupted down his phantom arms, but he found joy in feeling their company.\n\nOutside and down the hall, Isabella and Father Paul embrace; the sounds of the clash shook the house. Isabella yelped as a picture frame fell to the ground and she pressed her body closer to the Father.\n\n\u201cPai-Nosso que estais nos c\u00e9us; santificado seja o Vosso nome,\u201d Father Paul recited as the house shook again and again. Isabella picked up the verses and the two prayed together. A final thunderclap rattled the house, cracking the picture frames, and sending shards of glass everywhere. The house fell silent and the two cautiously looked down the hall.\n\nThe door slowly creaked open. An unearthly groan escaped the room, sailed passed the two, and departed from the home. The feeling of rot lifted from the home and the sounds of leaves rustling and birds chirping filled their ears.\n\nThe door widened as Larry and Carmelita came into view. For a brief moment, Father Paul could see the faint outline of the soldier\u2019s strong arms resting on the young girl\u2019s shoulders before his eyes blinked them out of existence. \n\n\u201cMAMA,\u201d Carmelita cried as she darted forward. The two met halfway and the mother lifted her child into the air. Father Paul\u2019s gaze watched the two before looking back to the man behind them. He returned the smile; another soul saved.",

            "comment": "Three years ago, I got into a car accident. A drunk driver hit our car on the freeway. My injuries were so severe that they had to amputate my left arm, right above the elbow. Came out of a coma finding my left arm gone, though I could still feel it. My hand felt as if it was still gripping the steering wheel. I could still feel my wedding ring on my finger. Then my world came crashing down as the doctor told me my wife, who was in the car with me, did not make it. When were found by police, they said she was dead at the scene. They rushed her to the hospital but they couldn't save the baby. My wife and I had been married for three years. She was seven months pregnant when she died. We were going to name him Ned after my father but all of it ended that night. The cliche statement to say that I was lost would be an understatement. I was dead. I was dead but walking. I was dead but still eating. I was dead by I would still shower, still shave, still wake up every morning. Don't get me wrong, there were days where I didn't get out of bed or at least whole mornings where I would lay there and just try to will my body to die. But a part of me, her voice in my head really, would tell me to get up, to get ready, to do more because she would be disappointed. It got really bad though. When the mornings in bed were more frequent and when her voice was harder to hear, I found myself reaching out to a place I never expected to find help, church. I was raised catholic but was never very spiritual. The parish Priest, Father Francisco, was there he first day I set foot in the church. He has been there for me ever since. We actually became quick friends. One day, months after we met and became friends, I received a panicked call from Father Frank. He said he was in desperate need of a ride, of all things, and he knew I lived close to the church. When I picked him up, he was decked out in his priestly garb but looked terrified. I asked if he was alright but he just gave told me to drive and threw his phone with the maps plugged in and the GPS barking directions. After a few minutes into the quiet drive, I probed again, this time he responded. \"Do you believe in God Mikeymcmikerson?\" I responded as I always do to that question, with a simple, \"I don't really know.\" Father Frank said, \"Its not that simple as theology makes it seem. The implications of the faith are wide and deep and sometimes dark. If you believe in God, then you believe in the bible. This book,\" he said waving his bible, \"is full of wonderful things, But if you believe it true, then so is the evil in this book.\" When we arrived at the home, Father Frank told me to stay in the car and wait for him. The look on his face was a look I had seen many times when I was in the marines, his face was stern, his jaw set, but his eyes betrayed him, thats where I saw the fear. It looked as if Father Frank was about to go into combat. I sat in the car, confused over the exchange. I hated the idle time because that left time for my mind to wander and when it does it goes to dark places. I got out of the car and decided to walk around a bit. The house we were at was part of what looked like a new subdivision, no mature trees were seen everywhere and the sun was high and hot making the lack of shade even more obvious. I considered walking around the block but then I heard it, Father Frank screaming for his life. Without a second thought, I ran into the house. Bursting through the front door, I saw in the living room father Frank his back against the wall, his feet off the floor and nothing holding him up. An older hispanic woman was at the other end of the room crying, clutching her rosary. I ran to father Frank to try and grab him and pull him off the wall. I ran to him with both arms out, forgetting my left arm gone, but when I got in front of Father Frank, I felt my left arm hit something. No, not my left arm, my left hand, I felt my left hand really couch something warm and it wasn't father Frank. \nI will continue more tomorrow.",

            "comment": "They said it was a miracle that I survived. A miracle, everyone kept saying. As if it might make me feel better about losing my arm. It didn't. \n\nThe guy in the semi, who'd been drinking and fallen asleep, had veered into oncoming traffic and hit my Rav-4 sending it rolling into the creek next to the highway. At least that's what they told me. Truth is, I couldn't remember anything from the day it happened. In fact, I couldn't remember the past week. Along with the concussion, I had a broken pelvis, fractured femur, three broken ribs, and a ruptured spleen. I was lucky to be alive. A miracle. \n\nI found out after I left the hospital that the driver of the semi had died not long after the accident. \"Succumbed to his injuries\", they said. I was angry. He took my arm from me and I felt I was fairly justified to hold that against him. It wasn't until I started having the dreams that I started to feel differently. Dream, singular, is more accurate because its always the same dream. I have both arms again and I'm standing in a hallway. Behind me I can hear people having a good time, the sounds of a party. But I can't go back that way, I have something I have to do. In front of me is a door. A sign on the door says: Staff Only. I try the knob, but its locked. Then I try to open it with my left, the one lost in the crash, and it opens easily. Then I'm in an underground train station. There are people everywhere. A train comes and people rush onto it. It's not my train. I don't know why I know that, but I do. It pulls away, off to its destination. I look around to see there are a few people still on the platform, each muttering to themselves and pacing back and forth. I recognize the semi driver as one of them and I walk up to him. I want to confront him. He's in a terrible state. Blood is running down his face from an open wound on his forehead, but he pays it no attention. He just keeps muttering to himself. I can't tell what he's saying, though, its incomprehensible. I try to get his attention but he can't seem to hear me. And then I wake up. \n\nI had the dream every night for weeks. Then one night, finding myself in the dream once again, I decided that I had had enough. I was going to get the semi driver's attention. I was going to make him see, make him feel my anger. So when I found myself in the train station again, I walked right up to the semi driver. I gave him a piece of my mind. I screamed and yelled and let it all out. Nothing. He just kept muttering to himself like I wasn't even there. \n\nI snapped. That was it, the last straw. I swung a punch with my left, phantom arm, at him with all the anger and hate that I had in me. I really let it all go. Every ounce of me went into that punch. The blow struck him clean in the chin. He stumbled back, surprised, and looked around wildly like he just woke up from a deep sleep and didn't know where he was. Then he looked me straight in the eye, a sudden look of understanding coming over him. Bewildered by this turn of events, I just stood there staring at him. He looked down at my phantom arm and frowned. Then he turned and boarded the train with the others. I watched as he took a seat inside the train and looked out the window at me. We watched each other as the train started pulling away from the station. He waved and I waved back. But when I looked closer at him I saw that it wasn't his hand he was waving with. He was holding a severed arm up and waving it back and forth. My arm.  ",

            "comment": "Since the cancer took my arm, life has been pretty rough. It was lucky they screened me after dad passed away, mom was beside herself that her son had survived.\n\nThe Doctors did a neat job removing the limb from the shoulder joint, but I have had to learn to be left handed. I am terrible, it always seems like I am out of practice and I get people starting at me all the time, because clothes don't seem to fit right.\n\n\nI just sort of ignore it now, most of the time I never notice my missing arm, it never felt any different you forget it's not there\n\nIt had been 5 years, I just got my all clear and my boss was letting me go, she was a bully of a bitch.\n\nI clumsily signed the forms in my exit interview \"After 5 years you still write like a child\" \n\nWe look down at my penmanship it was indeed awful, but, I never really needed to write all to often at a computer. She shook my hand with a pathetic grip, I jokingly swatted her face with my phantom arm \"take that!\" I thought to myself in my own childish musing.\n\nAt least until she recoiled. I was astonished, we looked at each other like I just slapped her soul, she batted her eyes in confusion, I stood there as nonchalantly as possible as if nothing had happened.\n\nAre you ok? I said. She took a second, it was like someone had knocked the sense right out of her. Then she took a breath and tried to speak, but it came out garbled like she had just had a mini-stroke. I spoke for her \"well I'll catch you around\" and yanked the door open left the room a little shaken.\n\nDid I assault her? No that's preposterous, the thought kept playing through my mind, walking to my car a little hurried, I dig for my keys and unlock the car door. +chink+\n\nI look down the keys are beside my right foot. I... I... Thinking back, I always opened the car door with my right hand...\n\nEven after the accident, I can't remember ever using my left hand, I reach down and pick up my keys. And it hits me people have been staring at me because my phantom arm has been holding coffee or phone I have been walking about using it like a normal arm and it's not... there. Oh my god I opened the door with my right arm leaving the interview.\n\nNo wonder I was sacked people must have thought I had psychic powers or something. Hundreds of examples of me using my phantom arm as normal flashed through my head, walking the dog, playing playstation, eating a sandwich no wonder people started at me! Some guy walking down the street with hovering shopping bags, Sat in Costa with a coffee and a spoon that stirs on it's own!!! \n\nI felt my heart beat in my chest and get in my car turn the key and panicked again I am still doing it with my right hand.\n\nI close my eyes, come on John pull yourself together.\n\n\"We need to talk about your arm son\" a voice echos from the passenger side, I glance over opening one eye... \"Dad!? B... But you're\"\n\n\"Dead? Yes well let's forget that slight detail for now, we need to discuss your arm, it's causing quite the commotion upstairs if you catch my drift and the boss wants a word\"",

            "comment": "It made no sense why I would be here. A place that no sane person would be. Alone in the dark. Surrounded by the bones of those long passed away lit only by the flickering firelight of my torch. But I knew my mission in this crypt. The rapidly approaching night that would seep into this place coaxing it\u2019s inhabitant out of its slumber. I also knew that would likely bring more death to the manor above and the small town below. The frantic message from the township was clear \u201c...any price but before tomorrow night...\u201d news of the demise of the much maligned mayor had started me on the way. Not that I had cared for the offical but rather the news of his grisly and unusual death and the ensuing panic had caught my attention. \n\nThe Mayor had been holding another extravagant dinner in the manor. Mid-speech he was struck with a rigor and then rose like a marionette being lifted by its strings into the air. Some guests screamed, others shifted in their seats unsure if this was part of some elaborate dinner theatre. But what happened next left them in no doubt as the Mayor was cast violently to the table. Wine and food cascaded from every edge while the Mayor was pinned to the table spreadeagled. His clothes tore from him leaving red welts where they rubbed raw against his skin. Those that hadn\u2019t already fled rose to their feet in horror as the Mayor mouthed a stifled scream. Then every metal object in the room rose to the ceiling. There was a deathly quiet. Then every fork, knife, and coin in the room embedded itself into the exposed body of the now dead Mayor. \n\nI had heard of, and even seen, things like this myself although seldom so violent. It was unavoidable in my line of work. Since the rot took my arm it was all I could do. Hunting poltergeists until I succumbed and became one myself. I prolonged my life with a balm while searching for the cure. But that could only work for so long and the balm ingredients are expensive. This means putting myself into these situations to battle the poor souls who had been overwhelmed by the rot and consumed driven into a violent rage and a ethereal existence. Their first kill normally relates to the righting of a perceived wrong. But the kill triggers an insatiable thirst which increases each night in intensity and ferocity keeping the spirit earth bound and only allowing peace long after the last human has flown from the surrounding areas. \n\nThe townspeople didn\u2019t bargain. They agreed and signed the contract faster than any group before them. I\u2019d arrived with a few hours till sunset making sure that they wouldn\u2019t have time to barter me down. A lesson I\u2019d learnt from too many lean prizes for too much risk. The information they gave me caused me to wonder if I should have asked for more. I couldn\u2019t manipulate my surroundings like the poltergeists but in their presence my arm reappears in its spectral form allowing me to battle them singlehandedly. Something about the impact of my ghostly arm causes the poltergeists to weaken and succumb to the eternal rest. It does also feed my rot. Which has worryingly progressed up my right bicep towards the shoulder. \n\nThe last battle was more of a non-event. The poltergeist had only killed its former dog before I stumbled across it. I wondered what that poor mutt had done to deserve the wrath of its former owner but was thankful the geist was weak enough to be dispatched without too much cost. The meagrely reward had left me desperately short of the most expensive ingredients for the balm; the last of which I had to apply after the battle. \n\nSo here I find myself. Stalking through the last known resting place of the only town\u2019s rot victim. The Mayor\u2019s son. The person that had more reasons than most to hate a man that was reviled around the region. Waiting for the night to come. Waiting for the poltergeist to rise and to face what maybe my most fierce fight yet. ",

            "comment": "He should have known this by now. The loud shriek of his alarm clock had pierced through his slumber, but sleep hadn't given up yet. Still half asleep he turned around to slam his alarm clock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe opened his eyes and with a groan he suddenly rememberd that his right forearm was no longer there. Why did it still feel so real even after losing it in an accident a year ago? And why did he not think to look for a room where he could put his night stand on the other side of his bed, so it would be easier to use his left arm to shut it down?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe turned on the light and got out of bed to get ready for work. It was cold and damp in the room. Winter had just started, accompanied with the first of the fog spells. His arm always felt particularly real on days like this, it almost felt like he could touch something. Luckily the pain had gone by now; last winter was hell because his arm still felt like it was healing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter getting dressed, he put on his arm prosthesis. Even after using it for almost a year, it still felt wrong. He had used it because it helped him fit in, but suddenly he couldn't stand wearing such a dead, plastic thing while his phantom forearm felt so real. With a sigh he put it in his backpack. He could always put it on again at work, but for today he would set out without it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was an incredible relief to be able to swing his arm around while walking to work, or at least have the feeling that he could. His prosthesis was always in a fixed position in front of him with his arm bent at he elbow, so it really restricted his forearm movements. Of course there were more complicated arm protheses, but they were more expensive. And to be honest, he didn't really need it: he was sidelined at his job. He used to use his strong arms as a construction worker, proudly building and restoring homes for the people in his neighbourhood. Why had he acted on impulse when that wall came down? He had pulled his colleague and friend out of the way, but his arm got crushed instead. As thanks they gave him an administrative job at the same construction firm, but how could he be any good at that when he could barely write legible with his left hand? It was humiliating, but he had no choice. Where else would they take on a crippled construction worker? He was thankful for the opportunity, but it didn't make him happy. He missed working with stone and mortar, feeling the power of his hands shaping a new home. He had always liked working with his hands, so he had never bothered pursuing the type of education that could have landed him a better job in his current situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time he had finished ruminating, he had ended up on the main street. It chilled him to see the Ghost Guard with their black and silver uniform out for the first time this winter. Ghost always came out in the dark and they were especially strong in the fog. They were attracted to life and warmth, so they tended to congregate wherever people gathered. The strongest ones could even drain a person's life force. A normal person couldn't do anything against them. Only special people on the boundary between life and death could touch and potentially harm a ghost, so the Ghost Guard was both revered and feared. They patrolled the main streets in winter, because a crowded street full of \"prey\" rushing to work and school was almost irresistible to the life leechers. They were rare, but not rare enough to feel safe in the dark without protection nearby. Luckily ghosts can't enter buildings without a human's permission, otherwise even the Ghost Guard wouldn't be enough to keep everyone safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe kept walking and was about to turn off main street, when suddenly he heard two loud shrieks: a high pitched child's voice accompanied by a woman's. He turned around and saw a little girl getting attacked by a life leecher, her mother trying but failing to protect her. The child's rosy cheeks, so full of life were turning paler by the minute as the bluish white transparent ghost wrapped around her. The ghost didn't even look scary: to a completely ignorant bystander it may have even looked like the ghost was gently hugging her. The girl's face said otherwise though, spurring him to action. He blanked out, completely forgetting any consequences for himself, ran towards the girl and punched the ghost away from her. By the time he had realized he was swinging his non-existent right fist it was too late. Horrified, he watched in slow motion as his arm stump was about to swing past the ghost, not even realizing that he wouldn't have been able to touch the ghost anyway, when suddenly he felt a *connection*. His phantom fist connected with the ghost and turned visible in the same transparent bluish white color as the ghost. His fist and forearm glowed and left white lightning-like tracks as the life leecher was pushed away from the girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExhausted, amazed and horrified he stared at his ghostly forearm, while the Ghost Guard rushed in to bind the life leecher and the girl was taken care of by her mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfterwards, one of the Ghost Guards came up to him. \"That was very brave what you did there. This life leecher was exceptionally strong and fast, so you probably saved that girl's life. If you hadn't acted, we would have been too late. It seems like you have what it takes to be a Ghost Guard, would you be interesting in joining us?\" Stupified, he could only stare at the Ghost Guard. \"I'm not sure\u2026 I wasn't thinking\u2026 I'm not\u2026\" he mumbled. \"The appearance of your arm says otherwise,\" the Guard said with a knowing smile. \"Think it over, I'll give you my card. The orientation for new recruits happens to be tomorrow at 9 'o clock in the morning at our headquarters, please come if you decide to join us. Oh, and please don't go to work today with your arm like that, you'll need to learn to camouflage it if you don't want to scare everyone. We can help you with that at headquarters.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill shocked he watched the Guards walk away to continue their round, a firm determination forming in his mind to take this new opportunity with both hands. One year ago his impulse to save a life had ended his life as he knew it, but that same impulse had also presented him with an opportunity to build a new life today. Maybe the loss of his right forearm would turn out to be a good thing in the end, allowing him to help keep others safe in a way he had never imagined before? Filled with hope he turned around to walk back home, his phantom arm finally truly swinging at his side.",

Or at least had it shot off in war or blown up by one of those land mines that pops up in the air and explodes by your head. But I\u2019m neither a veteran, nor a hero of any sort.\n\nThe truth is that I lost it because I got drunk, fell asleep in my bathtub, and slept on it wrong. Very wrong. For a very long time. When I woke up, it was aflame with the pins and needles of neglected circulation. So I waited. And waited. I went about my routine of making breakfast (at 11:00) and making plans and promises to myself to ensure that \u201dtomorrow will be a very productive day.\u201c But the pain didn\u2019t stop. In fact, it worsened. I had nearly dropped my plate when I threw it in the sink atop yesterday\u2019s dishes to \u201csoak.\u201c I took a shower, hoping the hot water on my arm would help the circulation. I even stretched for a while. Nothing.\n\nWhen the pain hadn\u2019t subsided by the early afternoon, I took a trip to the old sawbones. That\u2019s what I call doctors, you see, because I like to seem interesting. I sat in the emergency room for 157 minutes of burning pain waiting for some intern to cautiously poke a needle at several sections of my arm and point out, correctly, that, no, I could not, in fact, \u201cfeel that.\u201c He looked puzzled. You know. Like an intern. And then he called for backup. Lots of backup. Some doctors from outside of the ER. And then some from outside the hospital. And then some from outside the county.\n\nI lost count of the number of tests and number of minutes that came and went after that initial 157 minutes. It was in five digits, at least. The minutes, that is.\n\nThe experts couldn\u2019t figure it out. It seemed\u2014but didn\u2019t look\u2014like severe nerve damage. The most coherent explanation I got was from a neurologist with a very German-sounding name.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like your arm just\u2026died.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like your arm passed away peacefully in its sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?? What do you mean??\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as though your arm is the \u2018bad neighborhood\u2019 of your body, and all of your blood and nerve endings have decided to drive around it to get to your heart and brain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat??? What do you mean???\u201d\n\nIt went on like this for fewer than 157 minutes, but not that many fewer, bless that doctor\u2019s heart. Ultimately, it was explained to me that my body basically shut down my arm, and my arm died. So, I was left with a choice. Live the rest of my life with an eventually-rotting hunk of flesh hanging off my left side and likely killing the rest of me, or let them cut it off. That\u2019s a weird subject to broach on Tinder, so I chose the latter.\n\nThe surgery went as planned, and I walked out of the hospital down one appendage and up one gnarly scar.\n\nAs you might imagine, I missed my arm. I missed it so much, I could sense it still there. It itched, but there was nowhere to scratch it. It ached, but there was nowhere to rub it.\n\nUntil you lose a limb\u2014and I sincerely hope that you don\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s hard to imagine what phantom pain is. Regular pain is so easy to comprehend that seventy-five percent of songwriters are able to adequately put it into words. But trying to get your brain around phantom pain is like trying to contemplate dying and not existing. Or trying to imagine what existed before the Big Bang puked out all of the junk that would eventually lead to our existence. Or trying to read Infinite Jest.\n\nSo you can imagine my surprise when I woke up that morning to find my arm back, thrown behind my pillow as it used to be in the good old days. Had it been the good old days, the old lug would have been dozing comfortably asleep on the job, with the same pins and needles that had led to its downfall. But it wasn\u2019t. It was there. And it was emitting a subtle, blue glow.\n\n\u201cWhat???? What do you mean????\u201d I screamed at my arm.\n\nIt said nothing. And then it pointed to the foot of my bed.\n\nI did that thing you should never do if you\u2019re easily startled or if you ever find yourself in the midst of a B-grade horror movie. I slowly lifted my gaze from my arm to the foot of the bed.\n\nThere stood my ex, staring up at the eggshell, popcorn ceiling like an imbecile. The best time to mention that my ex had died of an overdose three years after we divorced would have been at the beginning of this tale. The second-best time would be right now. She slowly dropped her gaze to me at a rate that seemed like it would be a bad thing to do if you were ever the star ghost of a B-grade movie. And then she started screaming.\n\nFor slightly more than 157 minutes, I was frozen in an unusual mix of terror and annoyance\u2014I sincerely hope you don\u2019t experience this\u2014 as I was lambasted by the specter of my dead ex-wife telling me how it didn\u2019t matter how I described my dead arm on Tinder, since no one would ever love me through my faults.\n\nThen, of its own accord, my missing, glowing left hand clenched itself into a tight fist.",

            "comment": "My mom was always a very religious woman, I was never much the god type, but she was. She always respected my belief, to not believe in a god. I respected her more than her sisters for not putting others down for their views. \nShe was the one who showed me what empathy was, and not just the massive amount of empathy that we call a mothers love. But showed me what it meant to be empathetic to others. Although I found she could be too empathetic at times to her own detriment.  I feel like she never forgave herself for what happened at my birth. \n\n\"Pregnancy is a scary thing\". Is the first thing I remember her telling me about myself. Creating life was the only miracle I think she believed in. After I was maimed, I don't think she could forgive herself for harming life in such a major way. \"I still have nightmares of you feeling pain in my belly, The pain I felt for you in that dream is enough to keep me up at night\" Is what I would later find written in a calm handwriting in the notes section of my birth month.\nI Always hoped that when she died, she was able to let go of the guilt she felt. and now I know she did.......\n\nI got up and put my hand on the back of my neck to stretch...I had never done that before in my life. but it felt like a small wind storm on my skin that got excessively intense the more I pushed down on my skin until I was moving my head out of the way... I stopped for a moment before allowing my self to indulge in the idea that my forearm and hand was back. But I quickly snapped arm forward, to reveal a whirlpool pattern across my forearm and hand. I was amazed and shook, So much so that I thought I must be in a lucid dream. For a long time, the one thing I wanted more than anything was my arm back. And now I got it? It must be a dream and now I'm lucid... makes sense. I moved my new found arm close to see what my dream mind made my arm out of. but every time my eyes focused on a whirlpool, the whirlpools just got deeper and deeper it felt like my eyes were falling into the pools one after another until everything other than the pools faded out of sight. And I hear a voice that I haven't heard in years...my mothers...\n\nI can't rationalize it but I don't know what she said, Just the memory of her voice flooded my body, culminating in my arm. It was understanding, It was bliss.\n\nThen my kids hugged my legs, and my attention snapped to the kids....\" is this, not a dream?\" as the kids start to call for their dad, tugging at his shit. I  try and pick them both up, but my arm goes right through Milly on the right. My whirlpool arm passed right through her. I could only pick up Jessy on my left. \n\nAs to not freak out the kids I decided to keep this to myself....not that they would understand at 5 years old.\nOur daily routine was oatmeal in the mornings, so I take them to the kitchen for breakfast. My brain is spinning with what I just experienced, as I notice the same whirlpools moving on my kid's shoulder I tried to brush them off with my left hand, but it went right through, but as my hand went through it, I felt a little bit of that understanding from before. for a second, I looked down at my hand to see the same whirlpools taking the form of my arm. I slowly moved my hand over the pools on my kids' shirt. Turning my hand over the pools turned into the shape of a type of a bug. being as I am not a \"bug person\" tossed it into the air a foot to two and punched it. It within a foot of leaving my fist it disappeared. and my daughter looked at me and said \" I feel better\". and that wave of understanding filled me even more. and I heard my mothers voice again, there was no pain, or guilt in her voice... Just empathy. \n\nNow I see bugs on everyone, and every time I punch them with my, what I like to call \"my ghost arm\" they vanish, and for the most part, people seem to feel better, or lighter on their feet when I destroy their bug. I have never told anyone about my new \"ghost arm\" but it has given me the power to help people..... and kill a bunch of Grosse bugs.",

I'm in no rush, I could take 3 hours. I go to a small patch of land, mostly unnoticeable.\n  I start punching and pushing these ghosts monitoring me. \n  The last punch is one I will remember forever. I punch a ghost that retaliates back and pushes me into the soil. I yell \"YERT!\" and try to get back up. The ghost shakes me annoyingly.  I try to punch once again and fail. \n  The ghost picks me up and plops me near the sidewalk. Well, that turned fun into insanity. If someone was watching they would think I'm the weirdest amputee. \n  Here comes shopping.",

A ghostly apparition of a sword appears, and I grab it.\n\nI readjust my spectacles, the one my girlfriend had bought for me just before she got into an accident, resulting in a coma. She now hovers right by the edge of my vision, her mouth set in a thin line.\n\n\"Lim Kai Yang, I didn't go into a coma,\" said Hui Xin, arms crossed, \"so that you can go potentially kill yourself as well.\"\n\nI test the sword with my ghostly hand. Well balanced, easy to swing, and... I reach it to my dead elbow, and slowly slide it across. Sharp enough to make my hand almost disappear and lose my grip on the sword, but it reforms, and I am prepared once more.\n\n\"No, you didn't.\" I sadly look at her. \"But this will help.

            "comment": "The accident had been terrible.          \nA drunk driver in a new sports car who couldn't handle his vehicle hopped up the curb.      \nA small group of people waiting for their bus.              \nMultiple eye witnesses and a street cam watched Ed diving to shield a young girl with his body. \n\nLater that night, the girl was returned to her family and friends. Edward was surrounded by his in the ICU. Lacerations and black bruises were stark against his skin. The guy was already pretty pale normally, but then he had looked downright transparent. There was a red stump where his crushed and mangled arm used to be. I honestly thought my friend was going to die.  \n\nBut, slowly, he recovered. Physically he was still very weak, but eventually Ed's mind was back to usual. When he was moved out of ICU we could have longer visits, so I brought books for him to read and played an occasional game of chess.                                                                  \nAmputated arm excluded, he lost a great deal of weight during his stay and was surprisingly keen to keep it down.                             \nI guess a brush with death changed his perspective a bit. The same appeared to be true for his mother and father.    \n                             \nAfter it was clear he wasn't going to college like the rest of our little gang, they were strongly \"encouraging\" him to find swift employment and swifter eviction - sometimes with threats involving a pressure washer. Now, they were absolutely aghast at the thought of turning out their disabled son and local hero.                                \n\nA year or so after his release, we began to joke about the incident with him. Between the disability benefits, his parent's newfound hospitality, and a *very* lucrative civil suit, it was decided that Edward had sacrificed his dominant arm (the vice-grip for his two greatest vices: video games and masturbation) to Lucifer in exchange for the life of idleness and sloth he always wanted.                                            \nSo, imagine our shock when Ed invited us all down to his \"basement suite\" one Saturday afternoon, saying he was going to tell us about his plans to move out of his parent's house - and the new job that afforded it. \n\nEd's basement was a Stoner Shangri-La. Comics, manga, consoles, computers, posters, television, fully stocked fridge, and a music collection that spanned three generations of his family and six different formats. There was even a treadmill and modest weight-lifting setup in the corner, a gift from his parents to support his physical rehabilitation and health efforts. All that was missing were the stacks of vintage Playboy magazines, which Edward had long ago dutifully scanned and transfered onto a flash drive which he copied and discretely distributed to David and I.  \n\nAs we seated ourselves on the giant well-worn couch, he dimmed the lights and grabbed the remote for the TV. Apparently there was going to be a presentation. An image of a chubby white ghost, barred behind the international prohibition symbol, appeared on screen. \n\n'**Ghost Busting**' said Ed, gesturing with 1/2 jazz hands.                                                       \n\n'**Idiot**' said Jordan, doing jazz hands herself.                         \n\nHe shook his head slowly and chuckled deeply, prolonged and fake, like she was slow learning. Ed knew Jordan was far more intelligent than he was, but he had also been studying how to annoy her since elementary school. He moved behind the TV, and pulled up a long white sheet sewn to a pillow case with two eye holes cut out. A makeshift cape and cowl.    \n  \n'I'm going to become a ghost-themed super hero, who fights other ghosts. Like a Danny Phantom type deal, except I want to get paid and my mom doesn't have a huge perfect ass.'                         \nHe raised up his good arm and stump. 'How do I look?'                                                    \n\nDavid laughed. 'Like you want to lynch me, but also have to ask for my help tying the slipknot.'              \nHe pulled out a black sharpie from his pocket, and drew a big sloppy Smiley Face ^tm smile across Ed's cowl.                                                                               \n'There, that takes some of the edge off. Kid friendly.'                                                \n\n'Ok, ok, now I'll need a ghost-themed super hero name for myself. How about Phantom Limb?'                        \n'You know that's already taken.' I said.                    \n'Yeah, but Venture Bros goes on hiatus for so damn long I think they might lose the trademark. What about \"the Ghost Gimp?\"'               \n\nJordan rose from the couch. 'If this is what you called us here for Ed, I have better shit to do. Some of us, and by that I mean everyone here but you, has something they could be studying.'                                                 \n\n'Wait! Wait! Study this shit!'                                                                 \nHe hovered his stump limb over the TV, and it suddenly erupted in a violent scream of static noise. A black transparent arm, like an x-ray scan, appeared amongst the static. It began to flex and gyrate, moving in sync with Edward's body, seemingly affixed to his stump. \n\nDavid laughed again. 'Dude, nice try, but that TV is digital. My fucking grandpa doesn't even use analog anymore.'                   \n\n'I know, it's spooky that way isn't it?'                         \nHe stepped away, and the picture returned to the Ghostbuster's logo. 'Look, if you really don't believe me, hit the blacklight.'           \n\n'Oh God, please no' Jordan cried as she made a desperate move for the door.   \n\n'Shut up, just do it.'             \n\nThankfully, no mysterious stains appeared. Unthankfully, Ed's missing arm was now completely visible. More than visible, it was a see-through network of muscle, bone, and vein glowing in the darkness. He walked over to me and placed his spectral hand on my chest, IN my chest, and an ice-cold sensation raced up my spine. He pulled back his hood, and flashed a goofy grin as he withdrew his arm.         \n                                    \n'Believe me now, fuckers? My bad-ass life-saving ghost bustin' career has only just begun, and you nerds are gonna help me.'",

I then started battling it, again, applying the technique which I am most familiar with - the help of cannabis and liquor.\u00a0\u00a0And just recently, upon hitting the bottles and lighting up fat ass joints one after another, in my lazy couch, I have suddenly discovered a ghost sitting next to me.

The ghost looked shocked that I had caught hold of her and then began to rage against the invisible walls of the pentagram as I began chanting the exorcism.  Her tattered Victorian dress billowed as she tore at the air.  As I uttered the last line of the incantation, she vanished with a shriek.  \u201cAnother one bites the dust for good,\u201d I muttered to myself.  My next job was going to be in New Orleans.  Most people think of ghost hunters as a TV show about people trying to figure out if a place is haunted.  I\u2019m a real ghost hunter.  I use my phantom arm to catch them and then send them to whatever comes next.  \n\nI do believe there is an afterlife because the day I lost my arm, I almost died.  I saw a white light and felt a sense of peace come over me.  The paramedics stopped the bleeding in time to save my life but not my arm.  As I was recovering in the hospital, I would feel pain in my absent right arm.  The nurses said that was normal.  When I said that I would sometimes feel things touch my phantom arm or brush against it, they just gave me a funny look.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I got home that I realized what was going on.  A week or two after I got out of the hospital, I was sitting at home feeling sorry for myself and trying to figure out what to do with my life as a one armed man.  I couldn\u2019t work in construction anymore.  I couldn\u2019t go boxing anymore.  I couldn\u2019t practice sword fighting anymore.  I sat staring blankly at the swords mounted on my walls wondering what to do with my life.  At that point, I would still forget that I didn\u2019t have a right arm and tried to use it to grab my drink from the table.  Instead, my phantom hand grabbed a cold, clammy arm.  Suddenly a voice shouted, \u201cLet go a me ye specky cunt!\u201d  \n\nI let go and a ghostly figure appeared before me.  He was barrel chested and wore a tunic and kilt.  He scowled at me as I gawked at him.  Seeing that I was not going to regain the ability to speak anytime soon, he launched into his story.  He pointed to the claymore on my wall and told me how it had been his when he was run out of Scotland during the Clearances.  Callum (that was his name) had come to the states to make a life for himself away from \u201cthe English bastards\u201d.  As he was winding down and I was getting my voice back I asked him, \u201cBut how did I grab you?\u201d  He looked at me and said, \u201cWell yer arm is dead so noo ye have a ghost arm.\u201d  \n\nSince then, I have been using my \u201cghost arm\u201d to be a ghost hunter.  I have a job and a purpose.  I get to travel around and meet all kinds of interesting people both living and dead.  And I still carry my claymore around for company. ",

            "comment": "Willard stumbled the town aimlessly drunker than he'd ever been.  After he'd left the Ku Klux Klan meeting after they were so ungrateful for his wife's handiwork he wasn't sure what to do.  So he drank..The news that they had all died to the last man in their raid only fueled the inner turmoil he tried in vain to drown in whiskey or whatever he could get. The people he'd once  thought of as friends were dead.   They had also discarded his wife's handiwork sure, but did they all deserve to die?   A damned black man ( In his drunken thighs another word came and went)  Had killed them all?  That was impossible...  \n\nBut they were dead.... And Willard was drunk.  Very very drunk...    In such a state he found himself in a churchyard. Apparently a traveling preacher was in town..\n\nHe stumbled into the assembly and sat down in a back pew .  \n\nWillard's attention faded in and out as the preacher spoke, some of the assembly grumbling and some murmuring approvingly.   \n\nThe preacher reached into a burlap sack \"to those who believe in the laws of man, I make to you this argument against slavery.... \" The preacher withdrew a copy of the constitution, holding it up then placing it on the lecturn.  \n\nReaching into the sack again, withdrawing a Bible.\n\"To those of you who believe in the Word of the Lord, I make to you this argument against slavery\" the preacher exclaimed, holding it aloft before placing it on the lecturn.    \"To those who believe in niether the laws of man or the word of the Lord I make to you this argument against slavery.  Withdrawing a pistol, he placed it up on the lecturn...\n\n\"But know this, upon that day of judgement while will have to stand before Almighty God and give account of ourselves.....As  Paul wrote to Timothy, \"He shall judge the living, the quick and the dead, in his appearing at hia kingdom\"..\n\nThe crowd grumbled more, some starting to think the preacher was onto something, others pondering the properness of lynching him on the spot, preacher or not.. \"We are as he ordained, spared or taken by his will...\".   The preacher continued. \n\n\nWillard fell asleep about this moment, what he dreamed he could not say....  But he was awoken later by the shopkeeper poking him in the shoulder,  saying he missed the excitement, the preacher had been run out of town, but nobody had found him....\n\nWillard stumbled home, collapsing into his wife's arms ..  Willard decided that perhaps , it was time for a new start",

            "comment": "The news hit him like a bullet, and everything about it made him sick. From him narrowly avoiding death to his friends being massacred, he didn\u2019t know what to think. Most importantly however, was who did this. His entire life he was taught that the African Americans were lesser humans, weak and pathetic compared to the rest, but seeing what one black man had done filled him with thoughts and emotions he\u2019d never felt before, including a terrible looming dread that befell his entire soul. He\u2019d never been so afraid before, he didn\u2019t even know why he was afraid, but he was. Maybe it was because that everything he ever thought to be true was now challenged, or that his life may be in danger at this very moment. All he knew is that he wanted to run. run far away with his wife and anything else he held dear; to start all over somewhere else, and he went straight back home to do just that. He packed his things and went off away from his home. while his wife was frustrated and confused he had no time to even begin to explain his thoughts to her, only that they needed to leave. Eventually they got settles down elsewhere, and while he managed to get over the incident with the help of his loving wife, it never truly left his mind, it would forever be there every time he closed his eyes.",

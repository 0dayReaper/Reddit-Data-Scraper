You are up to 10,000$\u201d the host gleefully said.\n\n\r  \n\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t know the second planet in the solar system\u201d I thought to myself.\n\n\r  \nThe host turned towards the backstage; his head nodded with affirmation. Afterwards, he looked towards me asking, \u201cHere\u2019s another question, James, why would an athletic person choose a Grande over a Venti in a Starbucks?\u201d\n\n\r  \nI looked at the host, with slight confusion as to why is this a question.\n\n\r  \nI then responded with sheer confidence, with my eyes looking at him. \u201cBecause a Venti has more sugar than a Grande, so a Grande is preferred. As less sugar means less fat, leading to a more athletic body stature.\u201d\n\n\r  \nThe host beamed with a huge grin responding \u201cYou are correct again! You are now up to 50,000$\u201d\n\n\r  \nI thought to myself, \u201c*Huh*, I was just at a Starbucks, a cute blonde girl suggested I upgrade to a Venti, but I turned it down. What a coincidence that the question she asked was the same\u201d.\n\n\r  \nThe host, looked down at his script. Then, looking towards me with a calm look. His voice was the same but felt slightly monotonous. \u201cWhy were the swings at 7th lane removed?\u201d\n\n\r  \nI was taken aback by this question at first, *I live near there!*\n\n\r  \nI tried to keep a poker face, responding \u201cSome kids, would jump off the swings, leading to them to scrape their knees causing their parents to file complaints to the district council. Hence, the removal\u201d\n\n\r  \n**Ding Ding**\n\n\r  \nThe host jumped out of his seat, with his arm extending offering a high five. I accept the offer; with enthusiasm he says \u201cWell done! That was spot on, you are now up to 100,000$\u201d.\n\n\r  \nWhile I was looking towards the camera. However, at the corner of my eye, I saw the host make another affirmative nod at some people at the backstage.\n\n\r  \nThe Host turned back, with strong confidence he asked, \u201cWhat would an athletic person buy, with a million dollars.\u201d\n\n\r  \nMy eyes, full of arrogance, my voice with confidence responded \u201cProtein, Creatine\u201d.\r  \nMuch to my surprise, the host didn\u2019t congratulate me. He just nodded.\n\n\r  \nThe Host this time, was slightly panicked. While panicking, his voice was stuttering. \u201c*Why would someone choose a McSpicy over chicken breast with rice?\u201d*\n\n\r  \nI was slightly startled, I just chose a McSpicy over chicken.\n\n\r  \nI answered, \u201cBecause he is lazy, and wants a reward\u201d.\n\n\r  \nThe host clapped his hands. His anxiety vapourised. This time stating \u201cCongratulations, now we are on our last question. If you win, you get a million dollars!\u201d\n\n\r  \nThe host leaned in his chair, \u201cWhy would a gym bro, skip leg day for chest day\u201d.\n\n\r  \nUnbeknownst to me, this question was directed towards me, as I indeed skipped leg day for chest day.\n\n\r  \nI answered with slight worry \u201c*Because he wants to be able to walk the next day*\u201d.\n\n\r  \n**DING DING**\n\n\r  \nRight when I thought, I won a million dollars.\n\n\r  \nThe swat team rushed in, pushing me to the floor. \n\n\r  \n\u201cThis in, another citizen was recently caught evading tax\u201d. I heard from the television playing in the background.",

            "comment": "Tomas sat down at his usual seat in the lecture hall: a little left of centre, a little closer than halfway down. He liked to be close enough to read the slides clearly, but not to be the first student to catch the professor's eye when she asked a question.\n\nDr. Amara pulled a stack of papers from her briefcase and pulled up a slide that said \"POP QUIZ\" in big bold letters. The whole class groaned as the professor started handing out papers for everyone to pass around. \"Please use a pencil and write your name at the top of the quiz. You have thirty minutes, and then we'll discuss together,\" said the professor. \"Go ahead now.\" On the display, a timer started at 30 minutes and began to count down.\n\nTomas wrote his name in the indicated space, then held his pencil in his lips and scanned the sheets he'd been passed. Looked simple enough - true or false. He wasn't the best student, but he was far from the worst - attended every lecture, took notes, did the homework. He should be fine.\n\nQuestion 1: Two plus two equals four. True or false?\n\nMust be a control question. Tomas circled True.\n\nQuestion 2: The following equation is balanced. True or false?\n\nOkay this made more sense as a quiz question. Tomas spent a minute figuring out how to move some variables around, then circled True.\n\nQuestion 3: The derivative of the following equation equals seventeen. True or false?\n\nTomas worked for a minute and circled True.\n\nQuestion 4: You like math. True or False?\n\nTomas tilted his head, then shrugged and circled True. Odd question, but he did like solving problems.\n\nQuestion 5: Your favourite equation is E=Gm/c. True or false?\n\nOddly specific. Why ask about, of all possible options, the equation to calculate the event horizon of a black hole? Strangely, though, it was Tomas's favourite equation. He circled True.\n\nQuestion 6: You have never been in love. True or false?\n\nTomas snapped the lead of his pencil. It bounced off his other hand and rolled off the seat's fold-away table. What? Did he read the... no, it said what he thought it said. Frowning, Tomas reached for the pencil sharpener in his bag, and looked around as he fixed the tip of his lead. The other hundred-odd students in the lecture hall were bent over their quizzes, a normal class by all appearances. Was it just Tomas's quiz that was strange? He stared at the paper. He... circled true.\n\nQuestion 7: Your parents' divorce was your fault. True or false?\n\nTomas gripped his pencil so hard that he snapped it in half. He rubbed his eyes, then raised his hand, staring at Dr. Amara, trying not to look as furious and confused as he felt. The professor was reading something and didn't look up. Tomas cleared his throat, but she didn't look up. \"Professor Amara?\" he called out, but she didn't look up, nor did any other students. Tomas licked his dry lips. The quiz timer had stopped. \n\nQuestion 8: You're a fraud. You don't deserve to be here.\n\nTomas kicked reflexively and pushed himself against his seat back. He wasn't... that wasn't a question. He'd been trying to get the professor's attention, what - why had he circled true on Question 7? When had - what the hell was happening? Tomas circled True.\n\nQuestion 9: They know what you are. You can't hide the truth. They're all looking at you. They see right through you. You'll never fit in. You're deluding yourself to think you could ever be like them. True or false?\n\nThe page blurred and wavered. Tomas rubbed the tears from his eyes, but he couldn't stop them from coming back. His throat was tight and dry; it burned as he tried to take in quick, ragged breaths. The quiz was right. He knew it, somewhere deep inside. They knew. They all knew. They were pretending not to look at them, but he was sure that they were sneaking glances out of the corners of their eyes, from behind their hair, from under the brims of their hats. They pretended not to stare at him. He'd never\n\nQuestion 10: You should\n\n\"All right, time's up, turn in your papers please.\"\n\nThe other students passed their quizzes to the ends of the rows, then down towards the professor. They chatted and laughed and argued over the answer to Question 7, asked each other what Question 9 even meant, joked about how Question 6 was phrased.\n\nProfessor Amara frowned through her thick glasses. \"Tomas, are you all right?\"\n\nHe wiped his eyes and nose with his sleeve. \"Sorry,\" he said, trying to force a smile. \"Allergies.\"",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve always had a terrible habit of picking the table directly beneath the air vent.\n\nThe last five minutes have felt like looping broken footage: softly blowing on my hazelnut latte, easing my slightly rattling breaths, and letting my eyes outline the carved wooden street sign - the Sip Away Coffee Shop. For the last three weeks, I\u2019ve been meeting a recruiter here to discuss the details of a counseling internship I\u2019d applied for last spring. It\u2019s now September, but the waiting list was full of unqualified applicants and undergrads who\u2019d found work out of the city, so I was next in line.\n\nThe recruiter\u2019s name was Shelley Melbrook. A well respected therapist at Denver\u2019s local healthcare facility, she was known for her effortless charisma and wisdom that filled her patients with knowledge and confidence to seriously change their lives for the better. The past two meetings have been an introduction to the internship and its opportunities, as well as getting to know my history in undergrad school and to scheduling training, but today\u2019s get-together was the last of them. The applicant quiz.\n\nShelley has said the contents of the quiz weren\u2019t to be disclosed, but also not to worry - anybody who\u2019d previously gotten to this step found the insight and internal reflection of the questions to be an instrumental look at the work to come over the next six months.\n\nAround approximately 2:03, so eight minutes after I\u2019d begun my nervous dissociation routine, I looked up to see Shelley approaching my table with a soft smile, a new pair of emerald green glasses frames, and a thin suitcase she politely set on the table. We exchanged a handshake and a few moments of small talk, but it only took a minute or so for her to begin the quiz process.\n\n\u201cOkay, so\u2026,\u201d she started, grabbing the questionnaire sheet and a gray pen, \u201cthis should take you about thirty minutes to complete. Take a couple minutes to really reflect each question you see, and you can ask for any clarifications necessary. If you need a break to order more coffee or to use the restroom, go right ahead, this isn\u2019t timed. There aren\u2019t any correct or incorrect answers, either - just respond based on your memories and emotions.\u201d\n\nI nodded in agreement to everything she\u2019d presented, and twirled the pen between the fingers in my right hand before inhaling as long as I could. The sheet was one-sided, but the print was rather small - 7 questions.\n\nWhat memories of your parents stand out to you the most, positive or negative?\n\nAh yes, I thought, a great starting note. I wasn\u2019t sure if this was a purposeful ask but, as Shelley knew from our first meeting, I\u2019m an adopted child. My parents split when I was about 2 \u00bd, citing lifestyle differences and religious tension to be the sources - my mother was a confident atheist, my father Christian. A nasty court battle revealed my father to be incredibly abusive in the relationship, leaving my mom so badly damaged she wasn\u2019t capable at the time to raise a child, so they sent him to prison and me to a local foster home where I was adopted at 4. I haven\u2019t had contact with either since, as my mom moved to Bennett as a reset and my dad was released about 15 years ago, and no one has seen him since. I\u2019m 25 now. I passed for now to the next question.\n\nWhat physical features about your parents stand out to you the most? Who do you look more alike?\n\nI stared at the page for a few seconds before thoughts began rushing in. This theme is\u2026 peculiar. I\u2019m in contact with an aunt and cousin from my biological mother\u2019s side and nobody from my fathers, but as I\u2019ve been told, I\u2019m a spitting image of my dad. His stark brown eyes, thick black hair and ghostly pale complexion was identical to who I\u2019d grown into. My mother had blonde hair with a slight curl and sparkling blue eyes, but the complexion was about the same. I took after my mother\u2019s height, though - she was 5\u20197, whereas my dad was about 5\u20193. Their facial shapes and features were relatively alike, but I took after my dad\u2019s rounded nose and cheek dimples. This question was easy enough to answer.\n\nWhat would you say to your biological mother if you saw her now?\n\nBiological\u2026 She wrote this quiz specifically for me. A stark breath sunk deep into my gut, and my jolted leg shook the table and tipped over my coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey, I\u2019ll clean it up. Just keep working,\u201d she calmly stated, walking to the counter for a few napkins.\n\nShe must be showing this level of kindness because she\u2019s aware of what\u2019s on this sheet of paper. It took me around 6 minutes to even write anything, as my mind is void of any flowing thought or tangible expression. I could only think of three phrases: \u201cI love you. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d\n\nMy peripheral vision noticed her sit across from me again, except now she was contently watching me work, scribbling the few coherent sentences I could write before my eyes landed on the next question:\n\nDo you remember Buddy?\n\nTwo things became obvious to me immediately. First and more inconsequential, she had lied about the number of questions here - there were 4, not 7. The paper was nothing but white after the lines beneath question 4. I didn\u2019t know how to vocalize the second epiphany I had but I trembled as our gazes met. The coffee shop felt emptier than it was. I spoke my next words involuntarily:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my mom.\u201d\n\nBuddy was a plushie cat I\u2019d had as a toddler that I lost during my time in foster care. He was the sole thing I\u2019d held onto after everything with my parents, and the older kid I shared a bunk with decided to slice him to shreds with a steak knife after I accidentally popped his tricycle tires. He was in foster care because his bio parents couldn\u2019t handle his behavior anymore - that\u2019s what my adoptive parents told me, anyway. Their recollection of finding the home to adopt from, and seeing me sitting lonely on the swinging seat on the porch, always included that asshole kid who destroyed my Buddy.\n\nShelley took my hand.\n\n\u201cI have so much to say, so many years of stories to tell you. I never wanted to let you go. Your father\u2026 he almost killed me twice. Sent me to a mental ward for a week right before the custody battle began. At my lowest, which happened to be during this time period, I wasn\u2019t able to feed myself without shaking spoons of food onto myself. It took me about four years of counseling, living with a close friend in Bennett and working part time at a convenience store to fully regain my sanity and control. I wasn\u2019t sure if you were able to find any articles online about our case but, leaving town and wiping my old name from all public records was in my best interest. Plus at the time, tracing records wasn\u2019t as easy for any citizen to do now because the internet was just out of infancy, so I was essentially in hiding. I\u2019d gone to school to become a therapist after my traumatic experiences and the empathy I\u2019d gained through so much internal work, and I felt comfortable working in Denver. The healthcare facility was on the side of town your father wasn\u2019t known to visit, and I haven\u2019t seen him since the trial. Years and years of\u2026,\u201d she paused, as we both sniffled and blew into our used coffee napkins, \u201cwork here, along with networking and taking on more and more clients, allowed me to become one of the tops in my field. As extra precaution, I dyed my hair black and started wearing green contacts. This past spring, an intern position opened at our facility and, when I saw your name I just\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMom, I understand,\u201d I said, baffled by what I was experiencing. \u201cI am so, so, so proud of you.\u201d\n\nWe sat like that until 3:04 PM, sniffling and sharing moments of our lives the other desperately wanted to know, when her phone rang. It was her manager asking how the final meeting went and what date and time I\u2019d be starting. \u201cNot now, Darlene,\u201d she said with that soft smile.\n\n\u201cI need the rest of the day off.\u201d",

            "comment": "Here I was again, talking to another \u2018friend\u2019 I hadn\u2019t talked to in years and yet it seemed that Amy knew the answers to the questions even before she asked them, only asking to hear how I\u2019d play it out. Just as John and done two nights before. \nAll my friends it would seem are part of some secret society that convened twice a week to discuss the details of my life. But how? But why? \nI would have assumed Amy had just been gossiping with those around me, but the thing is I had just picked her up from the San Francisco airport where she had just flown in from Chile. \nOf course that did not mean that she couldn\u2019t have been gossiping with friends but it was highly unlikely in this case since she had asked me advice on a hypothetical situation her \u2018friend\u2019 was experiencing at the time, which just happened to be in line with a conversation I had with my girlfriend the night before, my girlfriend Sandy whom I had met 4 years after Amy left the US, of course I had told Amy about Sandy but Amy had never even seen a photo of her. \nBut here she is anyways with her hypothetical \u2018friends\u2019 girlfriend being named Cheeks. That was Sandy\u2019s last name for goodness sake. \nAnd just the night before that there was John asking me a \u2018hypothetical\u2019 question so identical to my supposedly life long secret that I got hammered alone after we left the bar we had been drinking at, this was a secret I had been carrying for 54 years, at least that was what I thought.\nI do not know anymore, it\u2019s been going on for months now, what happens in my life seems like public affair these days and people jokingly comment on and hypothetically ask about things I do in private with a straight face or non-malicious smile with so much detail. \nLike how Steve talked about his friend stepping in cow poop after I\u2019d just gotten out of the shower from stepping in cow poop, Or how josh just kept wondering how it would feel to be infertile just four hours after I received the news I would never have kids. \nNow all of this could be simple coincidences right? yes they could, but all these coincidences with slightly insignificant to highly private information happening 6-7 times a day, everyday for 3 months is enough to make one question things.\nCould this be some kind of conspiracy? Are they all being mind controlled by aliens who are out for me? Am I having a psychotic breakdown? \nI guess I\u2019ll continue writing after I answer Chris texting me asking me how I think I\u2019d handle it if I had zero privacy in my life. Why? He won\u2019t say, just that he\u2019s in a situation.\nUghhh\n\n\nEdit: please forgive my formatting, obligatory I did this on mobile and also this is the first thing I\u2019ve ever written, not just on this sub.",

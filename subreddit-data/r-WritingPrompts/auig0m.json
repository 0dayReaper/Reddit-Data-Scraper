That doesn't include any animals we've taken in here from your former plane of existence.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe leader of the group of angels stared at Steve, obviously displeased with his actions regarding his smuggling attempt. He should have known he'd be caught, but he figured it'd be worth a try, to try and save an animal from the cruelty that would be found in hell, especially for an animal like that. \"You don't understand, mate. They were killing these in scores a few years back, just because we were mad. They don't deserve it. Nor does he deserve hell just for an accident.\" Steve said, keeping the animal beneath his shirt as best he could in an effort to keep it calm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I understand Mister Irwin, but we have procedure here, and you can't be breaking procedure for your own will. His will is all that matters, and this is where it's supposed to go.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe line growing outside Heaven's gates continues to lengthen, with Steve obviously the leading cause of the hold-up. People were quickly becoming impatient, eagerly seeking their awaited afterlives. \"Please, you just gotta give him a chance! It was just an accident! What would you do in a moment of fear?\" the Australian plead, almost falling to his knees at the angels' mercy. Suddenly, the grouping was washed with light and peace fell over the disorderly crowd of people waiting; and it became clear that God himself was speaking to His angels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a moment, the light disappeared and the angels stepped aside, their voices silent as the gates opened as if to allow Steve through. A cautious moment he waited, before carefully stepping through the angels and the gates themselves. \"It'll be alright, little fella.\" he said, pulling the collar of his shirt away to speak down into the haven of the animal he has worked to protect. \"The others'll be nearby, I'm certain of it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took some time, but he finally happened upon a white beach, practically gravid with wildlife from Earth. He set upon the beach's edge and knelt down in the sand beside the water, opening up his shirt. \"Easy now, fella.\" he muttered, having found a grouping of rays. His hands grasping gently at the stingray, he laid it down into the water, a smile crossing his visage as he watched it join the group of others while he stood back up in the sand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe angelic crew recording him on video could only monitor as he turned back around, arms stretched outward saying, \"Alrighty, let's get back to Hell, shall we?\"",

            "comment": "\u201cG\u2019day, I\u2019m Steve Irwin. Today on \u2018Hell Hunters\u2019 we\u2019re searching for the rare and mysterious *Hellhound*,\u201d Steve said.\n\nHe walked along the cracked fields of broken rock, stepping gently with his tan boots, threadbare cargo shorts and low-cut olive tee. He stopped abruptly at a ridge, then held a hand out towards the angelic camera crew, beckoning them forward. \n\n\u201cNow, a lot of folks think that the hellhound is a big scary beast. That\u2019s all false. They\u2019re just a bit misunderstood,\u201d he said. \n\nHe pointed towards a burning field, lowering his voice to a whisper. \u201cThat right there is a mother hellhound with her pups.\u201d\n\nThe angelic camera crew shuffled forward on the bluff, zooming in for the best possible view. On the fields, the mother hellhound ran in circles. Seven balls of flaming floof ran after her. \n\n\u201cWhen most people think hellhounds, they think\u2014danger! Danger! Danger! But that\u2019s not true at all. In fact, these  are some of the most intelligent creatures on the fiery plains!\u201d\n\nHe jumped down from the bluff. The angels started in protest, but they had learned long ago not to question Steve. Instead they shuffled their wings uneasily and watched the commotion. \n\nSteve moved forward. His footsteps clattered over the rocks, and the mother hellhound swiveled her head, staring him down intently. \n\n\u201cCheck this out. When I approach, the mother hellhound is going to raise her fiery hackles in defense\u201d\u2014the hellhound growled, flames spitting around her\u2014\u201cRight now she sees me as a threat to her pups, so this defensive technique is normal. What I\u2019m gonna do is make myself small.\u201d\n\nHe hunched over in the fetal position. The hellhound growled, but her tail began to wag. The pups huddled around their mother, then slowly started forward. \n\n\u201cAww now, there we go, easy now,\u201d\u2014he reached into his jacket pocket\u2014\u201cthe pups just want to play, they haven\u2019t learned the difference between friend or foe. Now this is a critical moment.\u201d\n\nHe pulled out a small chew toy. \u201cCheck this out! Now watch.\u201d\n\nHe held out the bone. One cautious pup started forward and sniffed it. The mother hellhound moved forward, inches away from Steve, the bearer of death incarnate. Flames scored her pitch black fur, her fangs white with fury, hackles raised with spines of white fire. \n\nThen the mother bent down, snatched the bone from Steve\u2019s hands, and walked away. The pups followed her, but not before one of them climbed up to Steve and licked his face.\n\n\u201cNow look at that. Ain\u2019t she a \u2018Beaut? A lot of people think that hellhounds are evil ugly monsters, but that\u2019s not true at all. You just saw it for yourself.\u201d\n\nHe walked back towards the camera, and the angels set up a fantastic shot of him sitting on the bluff, overlooking the fields, with some really terrific lighting. Steve sobered for this portion of the show. \n\n\u201cNow the terrible thing about these creatures is that, more and more they\u2019re being driven to the brink of extinction. With the cooling of the Sulphur pits, their natural habitat is being destroyed, and it\u2019s a shame that in my grandkid\u2019s lifetime we may never be able to see these magnificent creatures again,\u201d he said. \n\nHe shuffled a bit, pointing out towards the fields where the hellhounds ran free. In the post-production room, Steve imagined they would do a slow zoom towards the happy hellhound family. The audience would watch them toss around the chew toy like it was the happiest moment of their lives. Maybe he could touch the hearts of a few lost souls and show all the amazing creatures from the depths of hell. \n\nFor his eternity, that would be enough to turn any hell to heaven. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n***\nr/BLT_WITH_RANCH",

            "comment": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nDeep down he just felt that this was wrong.\n\nI mean, he weighed 700 pounds. He had mandibles. He had poison. His claws were designed to rip through angelic armor. His voice could topple nations and his stinger would cause men to beg for death should they be unlucky enough to be hit. And we haven't even gotten to the scaly hide, sulfuric acid sacs, aptitude for wielding a fork in battle and physical strength that wouldn't look out of place in a Marvel movie.\n\nYet here he was, held to the ground in a forceful grip by a small man in tan shorts. \n\n\"Crikey, it's a big one\"\n\nBig one. BIG ONE? He had trained for eons to deal the death blow to arch-angels. He was lord of the fourth circle of the second plane of hell. He could lie better than a professional lobbyist and seduce any creature capable of cognitive thought. No small feat when you have hooves and your breath could lay waste to a Roman legion.\n\n\"The big ones are easy\"\n\nThe words hurt. He was actually hurt. It was a new sensation and he did not like it. He was made to hurt, not to be hurt.\n\n\"But at least it ain't a parrot. Parrots  always bite me for some reason\"\n\nHe roared. Well more correctly he tried to roar. His jaws were locked shut. What came out was more of an \"ghrhhrggg\". He was stumped. His roars was the stuff of legend. Poets wrote for months just by having nightmarish visions of his roars. \n\nAnd where did the film-crew come from anyway? Didn't they always end up down here? He rolled in the little man's grip and cast his vision over the scruffy looking group that accompanied him. \n\nWas that a 60 Minutes logo?\n\n\"He'll relax soon enough. We're not hurting him, we're just waiting for him to calm down\"\n\nAha. An opening for deceit. Such mortal hubris. He would relax and wait for an opportunity to strike. Tear flesh from bone, melt skin and take this imbecile's head and use it for jewelry. He almost cackled madly. Then thought better of it. Deceit. Yes.\n\nThe Camera crew came closer. Excellent. He could already imagine the agonizing cries as they slowly died on stakes.\n\nThere. The little man relaxed. He prepared. He could taste the sweet taste of victory. Every muscle fiber in his body struck out in unison.\n\n\"Oh, he's still got some attitude left in him\"\n\nNothing. NOTHING? It was a move that would have obliterated Goliath, but the little man hadn't even flinched.\n\nI mean there were laws. Physical laws. Wasn't there? Square circles and all that? What was this feeling?\n\n\"He'll calm down any minute now?\"\n\nI mean. If he couldn't even handle a small Australian, why was he even here? He had followed the dark lord for millennia. He had been perfected into a weapon to strike at the heart of hell's enemies. And here he was. Held immobile by some ever-smiling man who didn't even want to hurt him.\n\n\"There you go buddy, there you go buddy\"\n\nWas that a pat? A PAT? Did this mortal nuisance just pat his forehead? He would terrorize thousands for this. He would obliterate his descendants, remove any trace of him from history.\n\nIt did feel nice though. There wasn't a lot of patting in hell really. \n\n\"Just calm down, there\"\n\nI mean, it was mostly fighting, torture, scaring people. All that stuff. Not much time for relaxing at all. Come to think of it, being a big scary demon was really more of a life than a job.\n\n\"shh, now\"\n\nAnd that was all good, I mean all-evil. But maybe there was more to life than horrifying the damned? I mean, come to think of it... had he actually done any fighting against the legions of heaven?\n\n\"we're not here to hurt you\"\n\nThat was the point, wasn't it? To fight the legions of heaven. But that wasn't what he had spent the last millennia doing. If you left out the grizzly details out of it all, he was really more of a janitor than a soldier.\n\n\"As you can see, he is all calm now\"\n\nHe relaxed his muscles.\n\n\"I am going to let to now, buddy\"\n\nThe iron grip let go. He should fight. He really should. That was what the dark lord had instructed him to do. But really, what was the point?\n\n\"Ok now folks, we'll just slowly get out of here. I don't think our buddy is going bother us now\"\n\nFor the first time in his two thousand year existence, he relaxed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Look at 'im!\"\n\nA beast, reminiscent of a man yet gnarled and burnt with eyes like hearths gnawed on bone in the distance.\n\n\"Let's get a closer look, shall we?\" he asked rhetorically, already in motion toward it. The beast was, in all effects, a demon, yet Steve did not falter. He never did.\n\n\"Now, some of you may be wondering- aren't you scared? The answer is easy. No, mate. I wasn't scared up there, and I sure won't be down under.\"\n\nCloser he stalked, hands against the scorched ground, until he came close enough to make out the pupils of the beasts eyes.\n\n\"Well isn't this a treat? I know that one. Ingrid Newkirk, former head of PETA. I'd recognize that face anywhere.\" He smiled at first, but it quickly twisted. \"I know a lot of folks back home might like this. You can see the poor thing is in pain.\n\n\"I just want to tell you all back home that there's no joy in suffering. It's a tough one, I know. Crocodiles are easy. They try to kill and eat you. People are harder. Sometimes they pretend to be your friend first. But either way, we all need to do our best to show love.\n\n\"It's time for me to get going, now. The big man upstairs doesn't like me gone long. G'day, mates.\"\n\n--------\n\n*RIP the GOAT*\n\n*/r/resonatingfury*",

I'm Steve Irwin, and today, we're going straight to hell, to look at some of the most dangerous, and misunderstood creatures in all the cosmos!\" the man said. he was dressed in khaki shorts and a matching shirt, with heavy hiking boots on his feet. he beckoned his camera crew to follow him. \"today, we're looking for a nasty critter. it's got eight legs, shoots ink, has giant fangs, and the ability to spin webs, swim under water, and it's one of the smartest creatures in all of hell. we're looking for, the Tarantula-Squid.\" the man said in his thick accent.\n\nApproaching a boiling stream, the crew were told to stop simply by a gesture from the Irwin. \"look, right down there, it's not what we're looking for, but isn't it beautiful!\" he said, pointing at a massive creature. its fur was like fire, it's eyes were blood-red, and its claws were obsidian. \"right there, is a hellhound! a big, beautiful girl by the looks of it! we're gonna keep our distance, but what a treat!\" Irwin said, every sentence more excited than the last.\n\n\"a sad thing about the hellhound, is since they've been replaced by more modern and invasive torture methods, their numbers have been on the decline. in a few years, you'll be hard pressed to find any out in the wild at all. this is why zoos and wild animal parks are so important, and why captive breeding programs are necessary to protect and supplement wild populations of endangered animals.\" Steve explained, his tone turning solemn.\n\nthey watched the hellhound take a drink before trotting off into the volcanic and grey landscape. \"wow, what a great find. now, let's see if we can find of those pesky Tarantula-Squids!\" Irwin said, leading the camera crew towards the boiling stream. as they approached Steve began turning over rocks gently, and peeking under overhangs and dead trees. \"\"Tarantula-Squid are notorious for hiding under things, and leaping out at its prey! OI!\" Steve exclaimed, and he jumped back from a boulder as something leapt at him. he gracefully sidestepped the animal and flung himself down as it landed, grabbing the animal by the body only hard enough to immobilize the creature.\n\n\"alright! here we are, and it is a beauty!\" Steve said, holding up the animal for the camera to see. the body of a tarantula, fuzzy and round, and legs of a squid, flexible and lined with suckers, and the fangs of the tarantula on either side of a great beak. \"this is what we've been looking for fellas! look at how gorgeous this animal is. Tarantula-Squid are what's called a Chimera, a hodgepodge of multiple animals, and these poor fellas are at risk. they like to hide under houses and in areas that they're building new torture chambers, and that puts them in contact with people and demons.\" Irwin explained, showing the animal to the camera, and it was shockingly calm.\n\n\"these guys have a pretty strong bite, and that makes folks scared of them. but what most people don't know, is that their venom is almost entirely harmless, it's just enough to kill their normal prey of bats and skeletal birds. it's not enough to do any lasting harm to a person.\" Irwin said, as the tentacles rapped and unwrapped around his wrist and hand curiously. \"we're gonna let this guy go now, and I'm gonna head on back to my new zoo, but we should remember, we have to share the cosmos with all these creatures, even the ones that gross us out a little bit.\" Steve said, gently setting the Tarantula-Squid down, and letting it go.\n\nthe animal quickly scurried back under a rock. \"well, this's been a great day! I'm Steve Irwin, and until next time mates!\" and Steve left frame of camera and the crew packed up and followed him. This man could see the beauty in any animal, and it was helping educate, even after death. Steve Smiled as he walked, excited to plan his next trip, and check up on his family. he missed them, but he was proud of them all.",

Feathers littered the sky and orchestral choirs thunderclapped the heavensphere. All of it. \"This seraphim has been proclaiming the glory of God for 49,000 years, not seven but seven times seven thousand!\" Steve knew the show was getting old, and the results were always the same. Every creature in heaven only proclaimed God ever, and after several million years his passion for them waned. Rathariel, a cherubim camera-angel, turned his eagle-face to Steve. \"Isn't it time we put our eye on something new?\" \n\n\"How do I get out of heaven?\" Steve wondered. He thought of the biblical stories taught to him as a child. \"This God stuff is older than a croc!\"\n\nSteve's body and soul burned with the pain the Lord felt from his blasphemies. God's light was no longer there, and only Rathariel shined in the eternal darkness. Big R no longer needed his darkened camera lens. Life in Austrialia meant Steve had no problem with the heat either. \n\n  He found his new home.\n\n",

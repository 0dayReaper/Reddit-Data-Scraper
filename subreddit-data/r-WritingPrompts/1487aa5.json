I wanna do more with these characters.))\n\n\nThe heroic music on the other end stops,  and an actual voice picks up.  Rendshell is impressed,  he was on hold for 2 hours for the Villains Union, and he\u2019s a member, here? 1 minute. \n\u201cHeroes union, what is the purpose of your call?\u201d\n\nThe tall man in bladed armor stands straighter. \u201cCan you accept pictures on this line?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\nRendshell  bends down and takes a picture before sending it.  Along with  an angry, \u201cIs this how you people \u2018defend the future?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe voice on the other end stumbles for a bit. Understandably. \n\u201cI\u2026thi-this is\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHigh-rise, unmasked and bloody, yes. She is under my boot.\u201d The villain only gives the voice on the other end the chance to get one word out before interrupting them.\n\u201cMore importantly they are a CHILD! You let CHILDREN into the Heroes Union?!\u201d\n\n\u201cHigh-rise is 15 actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! A child! But answer my question!\u201d\n\n\u201cQues-Oh. Uh. We let anybody over 13 who has the desire to save other and the ability in.\u201d\n\n\u201c13?! The villain\u2019s union-\u201c\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a villain\u2019s union?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. But it isn\u2019t called that. They don\u2019t let you know they even exist until 18!\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Firebrand 17?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freelance, they want me to approach him once he\u2019s of age in fact, very promising. But that\u2019s beside the point. The point..\u201d He grinds his foot down treating his conversational partner to a very feminine, very young, scream of pain.\u201dIs you let a child fight a man who can channel explosive energy though his suit. You\u2019re supposed to keep people like her AWAY from people like me, not throw them at me!\u201d He grinds his heel down again, holding the communicator out to catch the screams. \u201cDo you hear that?! That\u2019s what you people are supposed to prevent! But here I am, standing on a girl with your badge on her.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long silence.\n\n\u201cDo you know how often we accept people her age, Mr. Rendshell?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never gave my name.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour power and your armour\u2019s voice modulation is distinctive, we do our research.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo often.\u201d\n\n\u201c5% of the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I supposed to be impressed?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I speak to Ms High-Rise?\u201d The villain bends low and holds the communicator to the girl\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cIs that low enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cLow enough?\u201d Rendshell asks,  before the girl\u2019s legs bend up and slam him in the stomach, expanding as they do so. The villain\u2019s posture change loosening his boot, and opening his less armoured stomach up. As he goes flying, High Rise finishes expanding and rushes over pinning the flying man to to ground with a hand as large as he is tall. \n\n\u201cThanks for the assist\u2026.how often do villains call to rant, and end up getting owned because of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re considering mentioning it as a union benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would recommend it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe controls the armor with his helmet.\u201d\nShe nod and crushes the helmet with a giant hand. \n\n\u201cThanks again for the time to recover, and the opening.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, will that be all?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will be all.\u201d\nAs the call ends High-Rise looks down at the pinned villain who is visibly livid.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a child, and they let you fight me!\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.  I can still learn, and quick.\u201d She shrinks her other hand and knocks Rendshell out with it. \n\u201cBesides. I\u2019m High-Rise II, I was training since I was 3. They give special allowances for legacy cases.\u201d",

He stepped over the fallen like patches of bramble or briar, The stubborn Wilderners who would not accept his embrace and tending, who rallied in defiance behind their ancient champion. A champion who now lay shattered and twisted at his feet. If he\u2019d said a word throughout their battle, it had not been heard, drowned out by the cacophony of battle, his imperial splendor, or muffled by the garish face plate. But now? Emperor Gregarious would thank the warrior who had delivered him gifts unmatched by even his most loyal subjects. He would hear his words. And if they were worthy they would be remembered by history.\n\nHistory would not remember the words. No, history would record when the Orange Emperor\u2019s benevolence became rage. Terror washed over every soul from the tallest peaks of the Serpent Spire Mountains, to the lowest reefs of the Silver Sea. The Blister burst, throwing clouds of ash and fire. Cattle stampeded. Horses threw their riders.\n\nAnd Emperor Gregarious looked down upon the scared eyes of a child. A boy, scarcely thirteen summers old. A child with locks of blonde who had marched away to war without understanding what it meant. Gregarious does not see Liam, chosen champion of Liberatious, but another boy he lost long ago, to a pointless war, long forgotten. He taps upon an old, burning pain. The pain that had driven him to seek the mysteries of the arcane. That had forged an empire. That had driven him to cast aside mortality and drive the wickedness from man.\n\nAnd he understood. It was not just the souls of men who were wicked and needed correction, but the divine as well. That they should seek to thwart him with a line he would not cross? Then he would find a new way to fight. And as he pulled the battered and confused young hero from the accursed armor and into an embrace, the Emperor schemed. And he wept.",

            "comment": "(this is a prequel of sorts from a previous WP I wrote, I hope that is allowed)\n\nThe alarms went off.  Who could be calling at this hour, I thought to myself.  And on Christmas Eve? I poured myself a cup of tea and turned on the security monitors.\n\nFive intruders. I recognize one of them immediately, he's on the cover of all those teen magazines at the newsstand. Calls himself The Wonder. This must be the new government team, The Crew.  \n\nI almost feel sorry for them.  I push the intercom button\n\n\"Please go away. I'm busy wrapping presents. I didn't steal anything. Or attack anyone.  Or do anything. I take December off. Check my file,\" I said.  I took a sip of tea.  \n\nThe five members looked around, trying to find any traps or security features.\n\nI push the intercom button again.  \"WATCH OUT BEHIND YOU,\" I shout as they all turned, awaiting a deathly surprise. Nothing comes. I laugh into the microphone.\n\n\"Listen, I don't have any death traps. I don't have any acid pits or spiked walls. This is  my home. I don't want to trip in the middle of the night and fall into one of my pits.  Turn around now or I will put on my gear and punish you all severely,\" \n\nThe big one, calls himself Titan Punch, starts talking about bringing me to justice and doing the world a service.\n\n\"Yeah yeah yeah, I've heard it all before.  Alright, if this is what you truly want...\" \n\nI put on my White Skull.\n\n\"Omega Skull will be with you shortly.\"\n\nI wait. I'm in no hurry.  I hear them talking. One asks why I'm called Omega Skull.  Damn, they must be really new.\n\n\"He says its because his skull is the last thing you'll ever see, whatever that means,\" The Wonder says. \n\n\"Listen, I thought it was cool when I was just starting, but then I built a rep around it so it stuck,\" I told them. Maybe I should hire someone to help me rebrand. Omega Skull is so early 2000s edgy Linkin Park/Limp Bizkit/Korn vibes. \n\nThe floor below me opens and I drop down onto my unwelcome guests. I immediately shoot a blast at Titan Punch and get him out. The big ones always cause the biggest problems.  To my surprise, he takes my best shot.  \n\nOkay, maybe they deserve some of my respect. \n\nOn my flank, the two energy users, Crimson Blast and Starlight fire their colorful blasts at me. My armor isn't even phased. The Wonder throws some kind of technobabble nonsense at me. They explode harmlessly around me.\n\n\"We know you raided the U91 Base off the coast of Maine,\" The Wonder shouts at me. \"Hand over what you stole and this can end quietly\"\n\n\"I never even been to Maine. And if I did, I wouldn't raid a government site. Too much hassle,\" I respond. Starlight gets close and I knock her out with a blast. I'm getting tired. \n\nTitan Punch and Typhoon launch a simultaneous attack on me. Typhoon is fast, Titan Punch is strong, this maybe a problem. The punch knocks me clear across the room, and as I fly, Typhoon is running literally ontop of me, kicking me around seven hundred times in a matter of seconds. \n\nI brush the debris off me as they all group up in front of me. Enough of this. \n\nI unleash an energy blast, with hundreds of white skulls flying towards them. They are unprepared. How could they be unprepared? This is my signature move. All five get blasted and fly across the room. \n\nThe 5 heroes cry out in pain. The Wonder orders a retreat. \n\n\"Oh no. You won't get away that easily,\" I say.  \"You come into my home on Christmas Eve? Disrupt me, attack me for a crime I didn't commit and leave without asking any questions? No. You all get to stay.\" I raise my hands ready to unleash another blast. The four I see brace for impact. \n\n In the corner of my eye, I see her. Crimson Blast.  How?\n\nShe fires a powerful energy shot right at my leg. Hits me in my knee. The pain shoots up throughout my entire body.  Damn. She's...strong. Way too strong.  Where was this energy and power before?\n\nIn a rage, I hit her with an energy blast of my own. The force tears into her and knocks her out. The Wonder orders a retreat. \n\n\"But what about...?\" Titan Punch asks.\n\n\"Leave her, we can't risk any others, LETS GO\" he says. He's propping up Typhoon who is bleeding from his ears and leg. And in a flash, they are all gone.\n\nThey left her?\n\nThey left a teammate behind?\n\nI look over to Crimson Blast. Her mask is torn to shreds. She's hurt, badly. Damnit. Didn't want to hit her that hard.\n\nI go over to her. I radio into The Hospital. \"Nurse. Omega Skull. I got a hurt hero. I'll...\"\n\nThat's when I saw it.  On her left cheek.  A perfectly imperfect birthmark on her face.  Oh no.\n\nOh no. \n\nNo no no no no no.\n\n \"NURSE, ETA 30 SECONDS, INJURED FEMALE, AGE 15, PREMIUM RECOVERY, THE WORKS,\" I shout as I touch my earpiece. I grab her and push the emergency teleport button on my belt.\n\nI'm outside The Hospital. A neutral site for rest and recovery. No fighting or else. The Doctor and The Nurse will help everyone, for a price. I don't care what it costs. \n\nI rush Crimson Blast up the stairs. The Nurse is waiting me with a slew of medical personal.\n\n\"Her name is Carla Gabriel, she's 15 years old, concussive blasts, she may have a lot of internal bleeding and injuries and...\" I rattle off to them. I can barely get the words out. \n\nThe Nurse looks at me. \"Carla Gabriel?\" she says\n\n\"Yes.  She's...she's my daughter,\" I say as they put her on the stretcher and take her to the operating room.",

He couldn\u2019t smell anything, not beyond the strong and acrid scent of ash rising from the burning city below the hill. \n\n\u201cI sewed your first coat myself, y\u2019know,\u201d Tarrence spoke up. He scratched his head, grimy blonde hair pulled back and lying damp against his soot-dusted face. He sighed, \u201cI was terrible at sewing back then. I just wanted to make something for you, before you went off to train with the knights. Call it\u2026fatherly instinct, perhaps.\u201d \n\nTarrence glanced over to the unconscious girl lying next to him. The mask she\u2019d been wearing had fallen off at some point. Her long hair was burnt off in places and her once colourful cloak had been ripped by fierce fighting. A bandage was wound around her neck, slightly soaked. \n\n\u201cDarla, I should\u2019ve known you were the one helping the Knights,\u201d Tarrence sighed to himself, \u201cYou\u2019ve always been one to take action when you perceive injustice. I should\u2019ve explained things to you sooner.\u201d \n\nA hoarse, cracked voice stuttered, \u201cY-you bastard. I- how could you-\u201c \n\nShe was awake. Tarrence wondered what she would think if she knew he was the one that carried her out of that burning city. He decided not to say anything. Perhaps she\u2019d hate him even more. \n\n\u201cAll those people-\u201c she was too weak to push herself up, but she glared at him from where she lay, \u201cYou\u2026h-how could it be you\u2026behind all this\u2026\u201d \n\nTarrence sighed, \u201cI could say the same. I didn\u2019t expect that the masked heroine my group was fighting all this time was my Darla.\u201d \n\nDarla tried to push herself off the ground. She groaned. \n\n\u201cCareful, I barely managed to stop the bleeding-\u201c Tarrence\u2019s eyes widened at the side. He moved over to her, dropping the lily he\u2019d been fiddling with to the ground. \n\nDarla murmured something softly. Tarrence leaned down closer to try to hear what she was saying, \u201cDarla-\u201c \n\nA poisoned needle shone between her fingers seconds before she struck. Tarrence was almost proud that she had mastered the little poisoning trick he\u2019d once shown her even as he lurched back, feeling the needle embedded in his throat.\n\n\u201cHeh\u2026you are\u2026my daughter\u2026after all\u2026\u201d \n\nTarrence fell back onto the ground, amidst the lilies. Darla staggered as she crawled to her knees, moving towards him.\n\n\u201cDarla\u2026\u201d",

            "comment": "A long, long battle was nearing its conclussion.\n\nTwo Figures, one basket in the light of the morning dawn, one cast in the shadows of the receding night stood face to face, only seperated by a measly few steps. The person cast in shadows, his face clad in a mask and wearing long flowing robes, with intricate circles and other geometric patterns woven into the raised his hand and from his mouth came forth words that where impossible to comprehend with a mortals minds, words that shatterd the fabric of reality, and weaved it back together in a new shape, for these where words of magic. This person was no human, as no human would posess enough Essence to weave the fabric of reality, nor was he of any other of the great races of this Star. Beastmen where scarecly able to use magic in the first place, and Elzrens the strongest magic users of the Star where unable to use words of magic themself.\n\nThis man, was a Demon, a demon leading Legions of them across the star in a crusade. Only 5 months have passed since the sudden appearance of this \"demon king\" as he himself proclaimed him as he massacred the royal family of the first country he invaded.\n\nAs the Demon king finished his chants, the world itself seemed to crack, but before any alteration could have manifested, his opponent, their armor gleaming in the sun, invoking a presence despite their short statue of something much bigger, rushed towards him, the sword they carried gleaming with white light. A Second later, the Demon King was staggering back, one arm holding the stump of what was once his other. The magic, having lost the connection to his body fizzled out.\n\nHis opponent, the individum called \"the Hero\" by all, was no less enigmatic then his nemesis, suddenly having appeared 1 month after the war started, they where the sole reasson humanity still stood. Proficent in several weapons, able to wield powerfull magic, they changed the tied of battle with a different tactic each and every time, and they almost always fought alone. And on this fatefull day, so everyone believed, they would slay the demon king, and they started to celebrate. For they robbed the demon king of his strongest weapon, his magic.\n\nAs the hero readied its blade, to strike the final blow, the Demon King simply cackled and the hero fell to their knees, their hand moved to their helmet and was died red by blood. They looked down and saw a dagger embedded trough their chest, a dagger made from pure magic... They realized instantly, the spell did not fail, it was completed before his hand was cut, this was a trap set by the Demon King. The hero instinctly knew, they would die within seconds, but yet, they didnt slip into the sweet embrace of death, something was keeping them here, small threads of magic, extending from the Demon King kept their blood flowing. The hero mumbled with great struggle \"he wants me alive to show the people despair\" as they resigned themself to their fate.\n\nThe arm that was cutoff disolved into black mist and reformed itself at the stump as if nothing ever happened, just a thing white line indicated where the holy sword had cut the flesh\n\nThe Demon King utterd 2 words of magic such common ones that even humans comprehended their meaning \"Maep, jeclrana\" a spell usualy used for communication between 2 people. But in his hands,the spell was so much more. It was the same spell he used to pronounce his existance, a spell that opend a Mirror of Water over every major city and showed his image and transfered his voice across the entire continent. For the first time since the proclamation, the Demon King spoke in the common tongue of the continent, his voice was hoarse, as if his throat had been burned with acid, but yet, strangely mesmerizing. \"People of Erzael, your Hero was defeated, they are on the bring of death, and only my magic is keeping them alive. Your resitance was valiant, but futile, give up, and you shall become subjects of my empire, resist and i shall crush you. Just as i crushed your precious precious Hero.\"\n\nThe Demon King draged the heros body up suspending them from the sky by magic threads. He slowly moved his hands towards the helmet of the Hero, a helmet that coverd the entire Face and was made in the image of the Creator god. \"Now, we see who is behind this abominable Helmet. Is it the Great Saint of the north who lived for well over a thousand years, the Magus of the west who decipherd the mysterys of magic? The Great wolf of the east? A warrior so fierce the kings agreed to never enlist him in any of their armys? Or someone entirely new?\" And with one swift motion the helmet was cut in twaine and shatterd on the ground.\n\nEveyrone, across the continent was staring shocked at the image.... but the one most shocked where not the kings and queens, or the soldiers who fought alongside the hero. Nor the citizens who placed their face in this being they called a hero....\n\nBut the Demon King himself, for the Heros face was that of a girl, no older then 14 by generous guessing, more likely to be younger still. For sure, the hero had obviously been of small statue, but some beastmen would have fit, and so would have the Elzrens, whos height remained stunted for decades, but this was a HUMAN girl. The Demon king had gone trough this scenario countless times, imagined every possible scenario of who the hero may have been, but he never imagined that a human girl, not even yet old enough to become an aprentice at most respectable workshops would have been his nemesis.\n\nHis mouth contorted in anger, hidden by the mask however only the crackeling of magic around him was visible to the onlookers. Some of the stray magical discharges hit the hero, causing her to scream in pain. Without the helmet distorting it, the voice was unmistakenly that of a young girl indeed.\n\nThe Demon king himself was startled by his loss of controll over his magic, quickly calmed himself down.\n\n\"Is THIS your justice? To send out a girl this young out to fight the enemy of your entire continent? No matter how talented, no matter how strong, you should not have made her fight your battle. The hero faught against thousands of Demons at once, ALONE. I never once masacred civilians, citizens, or children, even the progeny of that acursed kingdoms bloodline are taken care of. And you send a CHILD to battle me? Hide her identity? Gave her acess to magic that would drive most people insane........ \" suddenly the Demon Kings eyes widend, and he bellowed in a tone that betrayed sheer disbelive \"You didnt... did you? No, not even you forsaken people would not steep that low, it cant be.. I have to know\" He turned around, facing the girl, who was barely concious at this point and mumbled \"This.. will be unpleasent\" as he utterd 4 words of magic. His entire body contorted in Agony. it was as if he took the pain of an entire lifetime unto himself at once, and as he screamed in agony, the girl seemingly grew more healthy, stronger, she stopped needing the magic to stay alive, while unable to move, she would survive.\n\nThe demon king stood up after a short while, his mask cracked over one eye, revealing a gleaming red iris surounded by pitch black, he looked at the Mirror and screamed: \"It all makes sense now. why the Hero used a different weapon each time, why they never used the same magic twice, or the same strategy again. You bastards, you have done the unforgivable, you broke the one taboo the Creator god ever gave you. There wasnt just one hero, each battle had a different one. You never sought the divine avatar the creator god granted this world, you just created them yourself? You took children, who where still developing their own magic circuits and implanted artifical ones into them, full well knowing that this would destroy their psyche and their bodys alike? And you call ME the monster? This was the one thing the Creator God ever forbade us from doing, to meddle with the divine is the gravest sin. I was planning on sparing you all if you surrenderd now. But not anymore, everyone who was even remotly complicant in this will be eradicated mark my words, the war you fought so far was just my vanguard, i will bring the full force of my power, my divinity itself to bear from now on.

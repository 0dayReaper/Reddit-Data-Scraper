            "comment": "Marcus stood on the cliff face surveying the vast desolate landscape. It had made no sense! He had discovered the secret to immorality years ago! there's no way he could be in hell, he was home free!\n\nHe heard the sounds of footsteps climb the rocky trail behind him as he watched the fiery lakes burn. a sea of magma in the distance crashed against obsidian shores, bodies trapped within the rock screamed in agony with each pounding wave.\n\n\"Hello Marcus.\" came the deep thundering voice of lucifer who stood behind him.\n\n\"What's the meaning of this?\" Marcus said turning to face the 12 foot tall satyr. \"For 300 hundred years I've been unable to die. and now... this dosen't make any sense! why would the formula not work?\"\n\nLucifer only smiled and said. \"Come Marcus. It's alot to take in, I know. It's never easy for you.\"\n\n\"never easy? what...\"\n\nMarcus followed the hellbeast down the walkway. \"Has it really been 3 centuries already? Time flies when you are having fun, though I must admit, I was rather frustrated when I first learned what you did with our little arrangement.\"\n\nMarcus stopped. \"I'll go no further. Take me back home or I shall stay right here.\" Marcus began to feel the ground under his feet become unstable as the cliff-face started slipping into the burning pit below. He hurried to catch up.\n\n\"You'd be wise not to anger me in here Marcus. Though the unforeseen side affect of your little venture has made me quite amicable to you.\"\n\n\"Please.\" Marcus said, practically begging. \"Explain it to me. what did I miss? How did I end up here? where is my wife? my children? How do I get home?\"\n\nThe devil smiled again and said  \"I prefer to show you, rather than tell. It's much easier.\" he continued to walk, and marcus was forced to follow along.\n\nThey passed by several rivers, except the water was replaced with long torrents of fire. within each such abomination of nature was countless suffering souls begging for a mercy which would never come. Every once in a while The devil would construct a bridge of stone for them to travel over one such river. the pair walked for what seemed like an eternity, until the devil stopped him on one such bridge.\n\n\"What was the last thing you remember before coming here Marcus?\"\n\nMarcus scratched his head.\n\n\"I... someone shot me. They came into our home. robbery. I took the bullet for my wife.\"\n\nThe devil smiled. \"So you died.\"\n\nMarcus just shrugged. \"So? I've died plenty of times. never bothered me any. not since I discovered immortality.\"\n\n\"Oh but it has marcus... it has...\" With a wave of his hand the flames in the river below grew low then petered out. Marcus watched as the burned figures down below were given a momentary reprieve. Watched as their 'bodies' slowly repaired. watched as their faces, long since rendered unrecognizable began to take shape.\n\nEvery face he saw belonged to him.\n\nHe looked down at the sea of copies of himself, and they stared up at him. his mind stood still, trying to comprehend what he was seeing. before he could react he felt the devil's hand on his back and he was tumbling into the riverbed below.\n\nIt was only when he was stood among countless copies of himself he understood. he had died, again, and again. and each time he did he fulfilled his contract.\n\nHe watched as the flames approached.",

I knew it was him and I knew what he wanted. \u201cSo I did. Lucky break, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that how you see it? Because I see it as stacking the deck.\u201d He spun me around to face him. His eyes were cold, not quite furious but not quite calm, either. \u201cHad I known you would use the funding for this, I-\u201c\n\n\u201cWould have never made the deal in the first place, blah, blah, blah,\u201d I mocked back, cutting him off. I had outmaneuvered the Devil himself. Why not enjoy it? \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to finish this latest batch to show to the buyers tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuyers?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, from a major pharmaceutical company. I\u2019m taking the formula public. I\u2019ll be rich and I\u2019ll be immortal. And who says you can\u2019t have it all?\u201d I turned back to my work but stopped when I heard a slow clap building behind me followed by...laughter?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to hear,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cJob well done.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith that formula public, immortality will become widespread and rampant. It will be fun at first, nobody dying, but eventually it will get boring. Add in the fact that no deaths means overpopulation will rise exponentially, draining the world\u2019s resources faster than ever, and soon people will be begging for a death that will never come.\u201d He leaned closer as he softly said, almost in a whisper, \u201cIt will literally be Hell on Earth.\u201d\n\nI stood there, stunned, as the weight of his words hit home. He was right. How could I not have seen it? \n\n\u201cThe best part of all,\u201d he added, as he took my latest sample and strode towards the door, \u201cis you get to hold up your end of the bargain, after all. An eternity in Hell, paid on schedule. Think about that when you accept your Nobel, Doctor.\u201d",

The researcher could come up with a way to have warp drive.  Catch is, it's extremely expensive and no one has the money to build it.  The money that the deal was for doesn't allow to actually build the item, only research it.  So everyone is still stuck at square one.  The researcher could sell some of the research information for their own cash, but every time that runs out they have to research something else or they're stuck broke again.  Hoping that what they come up with, *if* they come up with something, is an item that can be feasibly marketed.\n\nIf you want to grey line it and there was no stipulation on what type of research, you could get around that by researching how spending money affects your attitude or the attitude of others.  You then might be able to spend in pursuit of that data for yourself or by giving it away to others.  However if you throw to much money into an economy, you risk drastic inflation and still not being able to get off Earth and it may end up hastening hell on Earth quicker.",

Too little land?  We'll make more or we'll use the land that is there differently.  Maybe we'll forgo having children at all until we can make room for them.  But you won't convince me not to halt death.  Death is wrong, it was wrong the first time it happened, every time since, and it'll be wrong the last time it happens.  And why should anyone want to die when they have healthy minds and bodies free of pain?  Better to stand shoulder to shoulder on a planet littered in healthy bodies than to be subjected to whatever sick tortures you have planned for them in hell, and better than bowing down and kissing the ass of a so called god that would allow you to do what you do anyway.  We'll get to work ridding the world of death and when we're done we're coming for you.  You can release the people in hell from their torment now or you can wait until we are knocking at your door.  And when we knock on heaven's gates if we don't find the souls there to be truly at peace, if we find that they are nothing more than servants of a petulant and childish being that demands worship from so called lesser beings then we'll make the same offer then that I am making to you now.  End this evil or we'll end it for you.  It's either that or we'll die, and you already know how I feel about death.\"",

He removed the slide from the microscope, walking over to the pill fabricator.\n\n\u200b\n\n\"It acts as an antidote to poisoning...\" he muttered to himself, smiling in triumph. \"It's a cure for all known diseases, it prevents the body from bleeding out, it reduces the body's nutritional requirement to practically nothing, it even reinforces the skeleton to stop crushing from being fatal... there's no method of death this cannot prevent. All I need now...\" the machine pinged and a small\u00a0drawer slid out of the bottom. There was a simple white pill, no larger than a cat's claw, but he knew the power it contained. Nothing less than immortality. He snatched it from the drawer and raised it to the sky, triumphant. \"All I need is this pill.\"\n\n\u200b\n\n\"Indeed.\" a voice echoed from behind him. He turned, shocked. The lab was supposed to be secure! Who had... oh. It was *her.*\u00a0\"You never told me this was your research direction.\" She crossed her arms, clearly less than impressed. Her form-fitting dress complimented her body wonderfully, hugging her impressive curves. It stopped just below her shoulders and above her knees, revealing her red leggings and shapely limbs. He would have been enamoured all over again, were it not for the fiery scowl she wore. He could literally see the fire flickering in the back of her eyes.\n\n\u200b\n\n\"If I had, you would have never agreed to it.\" he replied. \"We both know how expensive the ingredients were. Humans likely won't be able to reproduce one for a *long* time.\"\n\n\u200b\n\n\"We both know that's not why I'm here.\" she replied curtly, brushing a stray lock of blonde hair away from her red eyes. \"You've cheated.\"\n\n\u200b\n\n\"How have I cheated? I promised you my soul\u00a0upon my death and that is what I intend to do.\" it was his turn to fold his arms. He had cheated the devil.\n\n\u200b\n\n\"But you can no longer die, can you? Using my own money like that.\" she grinned slightly, licking her lip briefly. \"If I wasn't so impressed, I'd probably take your soul now. After all, where's your evidence that the pill worked on humans? You only had one blood sample.\" His pride died down a little as she pointed this out... but his pride came back quickly enough.\n\n\u200b\n\n\"You wouldn't have come here if it wasn't the right ingredient. You would have just let me die.\"\n\n\u200b\n\n\"Well, I can see now there's a reason you took this job.\" she grinned a little more. \"Very well, since you cannot die I cannot claim your soul.\" she turned around to face a blank wall. The paint started to bubble and peel as a large oval started to heat up, forming a damned portal. \"There's one thing I want to ask you, though. You may have cheated death...\" she turned to face him. He recoiled; her eyes were truly those of the devil's, amber and slitted like a cat's. \"But can you cheat time?\"",

The truth she faced was one all do. \"Who will remember me after I'm gone?\"\n\nThe answer came in the shape of sacrifice. The blood-dimmed King of night and dusk, shadow-playing and everpresent. She, a young foolish mortal, would make a perfect toy. \n\nA mother, a lover, and a child. Blood after blood, the sacrifices completed. Ground sullied with life and death. An archaic rune scrawled on old broken ground. A flash, a breath, a deal. But what she gave was not enough. Desperate, hopeless, foolish. An eternity given willingly, and an eternity taken willingly.\n\n       _______________________________\n\nThe second time he met her, she was young, still. A mere century had passed. This time, he came for her.\n\nA flash, a breath, a deal. The memory still fresh. She had fame, fortune, power. Memory of her would be everpresent. But the deal was broken. Shattered, thrown, lost. Time was coming for her, but not death. He saw, and smiled, and understood. She, uncertain, fearful, hopeful, did not. He laughed, and retreated.\n\n       _______________________________\nThe third time he met her, time had stopped. An eternity given, and an eternity spent. This time, he approached her. A foe, a friend, a fellow. The deal, fulfilled. An eternity in hell, but an eternity in life. A curse on her, put by all. Hate, fear, regret. Pain sowed in the fabric of reality. The deal, fulfilled. He watched, and waited, and left.\n\nEdit: This is my first time answering a prompt, critiques and feedback welcome!",

            "comment": "**NSFW Language**\n\nThe glass door of my laboratory shattered behind me, the lights flickered, and the ground shook. My co-workers fled. I stood in the room alone. \n\n\"I've come to check on my favorite toy.\" The demon spoke as he slowly ascended from the floor. In a plume of black smoke, from seemingly nowhere, he appeared. Behind me, he rose from a black tarpit. It bubbled and smoldered as he rose from the depths. \n\n\"I thought that was you. I need more time.\" I said. \n\nHe smiled, \"I'm getting severely impatient. You owe me.\"\n\nI turned to face this demon. \"This game is getting old. You don't scare me anymore Lou.\"\n\nHe hated when I called him that. Azrael was first before all else. A powerful shining star at the right hand of God. You already know the details of the story: He got greedy, he was outcasted, and bested by his brother Michael. He is, well, he was an angel; known now by many aliases. To name a few: the Devil, the serpent, the adversary, Satan, Lucifer (he really hates that one). The list goes on. \n\n\"You think you're so fucking clever, don't you? You're not. You're nothing.\" He licked his lips at me with the tongue of a snake. He grinned and laughed quietly. Black smoke exhumed from his mouth and nostrils, \"I'm going to have so much fun with you.\" \n\nHe has taken this shape before, I think it's his true form. The devil truly had the face of an angel. He had the physical appearance of a very attractive man in his late 20's. He was a walking paradox. He lit hellfire where he stood. But his skin was the color of porcelain and to the touch he was ice cold. \n\nHe approached me barefoot, and menacingly. With each step he left a smoking black tar footprint. Crunching into the broken glass as he proceeded. I could hear it break beneath his feet.\n\n\"Here, take a seat,\" he said, with his supernatural prowess, he pulled a chair from across the room and placed it behind me. I hesitated to do as he asked. When I refused, he simply used demonic force to sit me down. \n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked impatiently. \n\n\"I don't want anything.\" He replied. \n\n\"Then why are you here?\" I asked. \n\n\"Because I can be.\" He retorted. \n\n\"I found it, you know. What I was looking for when I approached you those years ago. The key to eternal life. It was in my own DNA. It appears that God did make us in his perfect image, after all. So what does that make you Lou?\" \n\n\"Fuck you and fuck God. You know nothing. Do you think he cares about you? Your existence means shit to him. You came to me, remember? I'm here because we made a deal. I don't want anything except that which I'm owed.\" \n\nHe stood up agitated. \n\n\"One way or another, the Devil gets his due.\" He laughed, \"You can have your immortality. I've known about it for quite some time. But it's fun to watch you monkeys struggle. Your new found 'eternal life', comes with a few stipulations. You'll figure it out soon enough, I'm sure. You're my bitch. So I guess that makes me your master. I'll see you around, I would avoid sunlight if I were you.\" \n\nAzrael then floated into the air above my head and disappeared into a billow of smoke as quickly as he arrived. \n\nSoon, my heart began to race. The palpations came so quickly and everything went black. I collapsed to the floor. When I awoke I was still in the lab. I came to my senses. Everything seemed so crystal clear. I could smell everything. Even the lingering sulfur from where the devil stood, I could hear my co-workers talking in a different room, they were frightened. I stood up. Everything seemed so bright. As I made my way out the shattered glass doors. I realized there was no reflection that stared back at me in the window pane, and the sun began to burn my skin. ",

            "comment": "\"Finished\". I whisper, rubbing my eyes and getting to my feet. Each cracking of my bones and twang in my muscles an hour, a month, a year . Years of nights not slept and days forgotten have brought me to this moment and I am ready to celebrate. It is only fitting that I be the first, perhaps the only? \n\nI bring the vial to my lips and let the metallic liquid flow over my tongue. I expect it to taste sweeter. To fill me with vitality, with strength, with life. As I choke the last of the sample down, I feel nothing. No change. It is only then that I see him.\n\nAs smooth and sly as he looked all those years ago. He is ageless, charming, and defined. A jet black line in the darkness, his white bow tie and shoes assaulting the ink of his suit. He appears the same as the day he made his offer. Leaning against a wall, legs crossed, emitting a cocky attitude. \n\nI reach for my glasses and notice something has changed... The once sly smile that seemed to never waver has become a stone line. His head is shaking ever so subtly as he looks homeward.\n\n \"I've won\" I muster. \"That's why you are here isn't it? I've beaten you!\". My confidence is growing. My heart racing my mouth, both trying to stop the other.\n\nHis gaze falls upon me, his eyes seem almost sympathetic.\n\n\"It appears you have...\" He says, unblinking as he turns towards the door.\n\n\"What's this?! No response!?! No clever retort!?!\" I scream. \"You will never have me. I have all the time in the world!\"\n\nAt this he pauses. Without turning, he says \" isn't it funny, that taste... You expect it to be sweeter\" \n\n\" What do you mean?\" My voice decides to reply.\n\n\"The elixir... You are not it's first to embrace. Have you never wondered what I truly am? What things I have seen to make me this way? Those I have lost? Have loved? Have yearned to reknow?\"\n\nHe turns to face me once more. \n\n\"The gift you have given yourself can never be returned. Try as you might, you will fall victim to it's wonder. You will never age from this point but neither too will your memories. You will watch as the last shred of light is ripped from the universe and experience first hand the brilliant shine of a new universe forming. Those who wish to know you will cast you off as a demon. Those you wish to know will never understand. Never aging, all knowing, immortal\"\n\nHe turns again to the door and walks slowly away. I can faintly hear his bones cracking with each step.\n\nEdit: vial and final sentence structure",

She still had to run the next batch of samples, and if she was even a tiny bit off with the timing, they would become useless.\n\nBut she couldn't ignore him entirely, she supposed. \"What do you want?\" she asked, then carefully set her vial down and placed the entire group of vials into the freezer. She stripped her gloves. \n\nLucifer narrowed his kohl-rimmed eyes at her. \"You know very well what I'm here for.\" \n\nKassidy shrugged. \"Not sure what you're talking about.\" \n\nHe gritted his teeth and walked around the metal table until he was standing right in front of her. He slammed the newspaper down onto the table. Kassidy barely took a look at it before giving him a small smile. \"Well, congratulations to that little old lady, I suppose. Living until you're 120 years old is quite a feat.\"  \n\nHe wanted to kill her. \"Yeah, it would be quite an accomplishment,\" he said, his jaw clenching, 'if she weren't supposed to die two months ago.\" He pulled out his tablet and quickly typed in the lady's name, then flipped it around and showed her. On the screen, along with a picture of the elderly women, was the age at which she was supposed to die. Instead of a positive time ticking down towards her death, it was now negative. \"And I know you gave her that serum you concocted,\" he hissed. \"We had a deal.\" \n\nKassidy raised an eyebrow. \"We did, in fact. And I am upholding my part of the deal splendidly well.\" \n\nHis pale eyes flashed. \"You know immortality is not to be trifled with.\" \n\nKassidy scoffed. \"Right. So only the Gods get it. Because I'm sure you guys clearly deserve it.\" \n\nLucifer's lips narrowed into a thin line. \"I forgave that you drank the damn thing yourself. I granted you amnesty. You don't know how *angry* Fred was with me when I told him he couldn't take your soul and had to explain why. He threw a temper tantrum for three days straight, trained Cerberus to basically revolt against me, and then quit his job for a whole week.\" He paced around the table. \"People not dying for a whole week. Did you know the horror that caused? Gunshot wounds in stasis, people who should have bled out, dear lord, the number of newspapers I had to forcefully recall.\" He moaned, clutching his head in his hands. \"Half my minions are still on holiday because of the overtime.\" \n\nThen he raised his head. \"And now this. How many people have you given the serum to?\" He opened the fridge and pulled out the vial with swirling amber liquid, smashing it against the floor. The liquid evaporated almost immediately upon contact with the air. \n\n\"Just a few,\" Kassidy said calmly. She shrugged off her lab coat. It looked like she wasn't about to get any more work done today. The last time Lucifer had paid her a visit, he'd stayed for three days and three nights. \"But I was actually thinking of selling it.\"\n\nBefore he realized what he was doing, Lucifer unsheathed his claws, and they hovered inches from her face. \"Say that again.\" His tone was deathly calm. If she actually decided to sell the immortality serum, the entire world would be thrown into chaos. The other gods, who had slumbered since thousands of years ago, would finally awaken, and he would be put on trial for mishandling things. \n\nIf things turned out badly, he might even be stripped of his title. And where would he be then? \n\nKassidy didn't even blink at his threat. She was used to it by now. \"You're threatening the mother of your future child?\" she asked, then turned around and grabbed her keys from the counter. \n\nAt first, the question didn't register. Then Lucifer blinked. And blinked again. Mother of his...his eyes widened and flashed with something akin to joy. As much joy as he was capable of feeling, anyhow. \n\n\"You're pregnant?\" he asked. His claws sheathed themselves, and he touched Kassidy's arm, turning her around. \"Since when?\" \n\nShe nearly rolled her eyes at him. \"Since three months ago. I was going to tell you, but you didn't respond, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.\" She shrugged. \n\nHence the old lady. \n\nHe couldn't even be mad at her now. \n\n\"But it's fine. Apparently you didn't think answering my summonings was important enough. So you can head back to Hell now.\" She walked towards the lab doors. \n\nShe was mad. He was incredibly bad at reading emotions, but that much he knew. \n\n\"Kassidy, wait up!\" he yelled, then followed her out like a puppy dog chasing after its owner.\n\n*****\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/99qwrz/wp_the_other_gods_who_had_slumbered_since/e4pymgy/) is here, based off the prompt response that was generated from this story, haha.\n\nr/AlannaWu",

My intellect.  \n  \nSo I made a deal. My soul in return for unlimited funding for my research. Once I had his infernal signature, I drank the elixir. I didn't even wait for him to leave, just pulled it out of my pocket and quaffed the lot. The look in his eyes... He should have been angry, but instead, he gloated.  \n  \nTurns out that the position of Devil is less an eternal damnation, and more a temporary position that gets passed on to whoever is foolish enough to seek immortality. He turned to ashes with a smile on his lips. Blessed nothingness was his.",

She always looked beautiful under the same candle light at our restaurant. She smiled briefly and I continued to listen to her among the chatter. \u201cYou will survive as the last your kind stops breathing, and you will live on this planet until the day. Maybe, maybe your planet will be destroyed, and you will drift in space until you land on another planet. You will survive until the last life is gone, possibly to my pit. There will be a time where there is no one left to know your name. As most either suffer in my pit, or relax with the big guy, you will experience neither. You will wait. You will wait until the big guy hits the lights again and you will be gone. Do you really want that?\u201d\n\nI blinked a few times in awe of her short pink dress and scratched my chin as I rested on the table. \u201cWill you visit me again?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day.\u201d Her toes found my leg under the table. \u201cBut that was not my question.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes... Yes, I am ready. There is no one I\u2019d rather be with for an eternity than you. I know my past, alright? If I died, If I didn\u2019t become immortal, there would be a big chance I would be sent with the big guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe your mom was such a religious nutcrack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, the last time I asked my dad about birds and bees, he locked me up in the shed for a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still thought you should have taken the chance. Maybe you would survive the gunshot wound, and live until your 80s sinning with me.\u201d Lucy pulled her leg back and returned to eat her brownie. Her bronze hair\u2019s peachy smell hit my nose.\n\n\u201cI could not risk it. The Big Guy would trick me anyway. They are good at that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to raise an army with you.

Sleep with the souls of other men.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else either.\u201d I could see the candle light and my face reflecting on her abysmal eyes. \u201cYou know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that now!

People reveled in a world where time no longer restrained a person's life. But after learning all that could be learned, tasting all that could be tasted, and seeing all of the world's beauty, man's thirst for newness, his desire for stimulation, led him down a path of self destruction. Perversion, suffering, pain, and sadism were all sought not as a way to find meaning in a now meaningless life, but as a way to simply feel alive. \n\nHaving lost the concept of morality, mankind brought hell itself to the world of the living. And those who wanted peace and quiet, an escape from hell on earth, would resort to ending their own lives. But with religion banished long ago, and with it, it's quaint ideas on gods and afterlife, humanity had long forgotten that damning eternal consequence of suicide. \n\nIn this way, the devil didn't win the soul of Dr. Jamos Wikheusen, but did win the souls of billions more.

I was sitting in my home study; he was leaning on the large globe I had by the window. \n\n\u201cNow, Mr. Lucifer, sir, we\u2019ve still got a contract and I haven\u2019t broken it at all. In fact, other than my dealings with you, I still exist as a neutral player in the grand scheme of morality and life and all. Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop with the \u2018sir this\u2019, \u2018sir that\u2019. It\u2019s demeaning to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course Mr. Lucifer.\u201d\n\n\u201cJimmy. You\u2019ve fucked me and you\u2019ve fucked me good and hard. I think we can be on a first name basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cSatan?\u201d\n\nHe stopped leaning on the globe and walked over toward me, shifting into his female form, the toothpick now a cigarette in a holder. The new form was one I\u2019d seen before.\n\n\u201cCall me Sadie tonight. Sexy Sadie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYikes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m allowed to be theatrical and a bit eccentric. I\u2019m the devil.\u201d Sadie winked at me, pressing her eyelids gently together as the left side of her mouth twitched up in a smirk. Her spattering of freckles that played across her nose and the tops of her cheeks complimented her smirk well.\nSo did her light green eyes and her dimples. \n\n\u201cSadie, hear me out for a moment,\u201d I started to explain myself and waited to be interrupted. She said nothing. I cleared my throat and pulled out a folder of figures and charts and references.\n\n\u201cHear me out,\u201d I started again. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered the trick of immortality. That\u2019s all it really is: a trick. I\u2019ve discovered it and so I can never die. Which does not break our agreement. However, in understanding that I have deprived you of my soul, I\u2019m inclined to make a new deal with you, on top of the old deal.\u201d\n\nSadie looked at me with her doe eyes and let the cigarette dangle from her lower lip, lightly, sexy. I wondered which circle of hell was reserved for people who wanted to know the devil biblically.\nI opened the folder and distracted myself with the pages. \n\n\u201cIf we consider my contributions to society thus far, it would be fair to say that they are minimal. Making me a neutral player in the \u201cGreater Good\u201d campaign.\u201d\n\nSadie was keeping her large eyes on me. I could see her look me up and down and I knew the play here: the devil was going to try the old seduction-negotiation.\nI was very glad she\u2019d arrived after my wisdom fap. \n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, though: I have immortality, which is arguably the best thing for the greater good. However. . .\u201d I let it drag on for effect before saying: \u201cI plan to actively withhold it from the world, thereby becoming a player for the negative side of the Greater Good campaign.\u201d\n\nSadie stopped staring at my lips and the cigarette and holder disappeared. She was interested in my deal, but I could tell I\u2019d need to sweeten it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice and all, Jimmy, but that\u2019s not exactly enough to make up for your soul. You\u2019ve cheated the devil, played dirty against the dirtiest player there is. There\u2019s a hefty price on that soul of yours and I\u2019d like to cash it in.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr\u2014 uh, Sadie, sorry,\u201d I scratched my head and started again. \u201cSadie, I\u2019ve got a whole business plan and a willingness to partner up with you. I\u2019ll live forever, so you\u2019ll have a partner forever.\u201d\n\nI handed her the folder and she skimmed through, slowing as she gradually understood my intentions. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve discovered immortality and you plan to market it? With no intention of giving it to anyone but yourself? Creating a caste business model where employees are motivated to move up the ladder, cutting throats, stabbing backs, all in the hopes of becoming an employee with a level high enough to be granted immortality?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the gist of it. I basically ripped off loads of spiritual books.\u201d\n\nShe bit her lower lip. \n\n\u201cJimmy, I think I\u2019ve fallen in love. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d \n\nShe put out her hand and I shook it, wondering if the phrase had been a double entendre. \n\n\u201cAny chance you meant anything by your choice of phrase?\u201d\n\nShe laughed lightly and walked back to the globe, spinning it as she turned to face me. \n\n\u201cI think fucking me once was enough, Jimmy.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, she was gone.

            "comment": "I recently lost funding due to becoming immortal. Its weird to say out loud, but the devil stopped paying my bills after my \"breach of contract\", well that's what his lawyers say.  You could say he's got a few on permanent retainer.  Our original deal was I would spend eternity in hell after death in return for a bottomless pool of cash to fund my research.  Well, to make a long story short, it took me just 4 months to figure out how to infuse living cells with immortality! Just CRISPR and a few segments of DNA from some microbes and WHAM!, no more pesky death.  Of course, my efforts to get approval from the FDA were laughed at and human trials were seen as a joke.  No one took me seriously.  This pleased the devil to no end, of course.  Well, that was until I found out I was sick.  \n\nIncurable.  Not something you want to hear from your doctor.  I had a sneaky suspicion that my acquisition of this disease was not accidental.  He wanted to collect of course.  I sensed an uneasiness whenever he appeared from his very clich\u00e9 puff of smoke.  Every night he showed up just to mock my efforts, and begrudgingly sign the next check.  \"You're sure costing me a lot lately, Mr. Amaranthine,\" he said coyly, \"But soon your punishment will begin, so enjoy it while you ....,\" he paused and looked puzzled.  \"Why is this check just for two cents? Don't you want to enjoy what time you have left?\"  I couldn't help but crack a slight smile. So I replied, \"I have plenty of money, billions in fact, what could I possibly need more for?\"  The devil looked puzzled and strolled up closer to me and eyed me head to toe. \"Something... Something is different. I can't smell your fear of death anymore.\"  My smile widened, almost as much as the devils eyes. I could see a look of confusion wash across his face. \"It's impossible though, all humans fear death.\" he muttered to himself while stroking his his goatee. Suddenly, he started turning brighter and brighter red, small flames started dancing across his skin. All the  humanistic charm and sly wit burned away as his features quickly transformed into a demonic scowl. \"YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM MY LAWYERS!\" he thundered at me, as he vaporized in a huge fireball. \"Wow\", I thought to myself, \"maybe it wasn't smart to antagonize him.\" \n\nIf you hadn't guessed, I pulled a Jonas Salk and tested the procedure I developed on myself. What was there to lose? Turns out, plenty! It's not smart to trick the devil. Old Nick doesn't take kindly to being mocked. His army of lawyers descended on every aspect of my life. First, they discredited me professionally, as if I wasn't already a laughing stock, I was now unhireable. Second, they drove my family and friends away by painting me as the a Cosby/Weinstein level asshole. Hoardes of prostitutes and drug dealers all claiming I bought something off them. It took every last dollar I had to fight the onslaught of accusations. Lastly, they sued for Breach of Contract. Something that had never been done before. Heck of a trial! The devil had never thought about someone not being able to give up their mortal soul, so there were never any exit clauses added for such a situation. Turns out, once you ascend past deaths reach and truly become immortal, your soul is also therfore immortal.  The whole original contract was ruled to be no longer valid though, since I was no longer able to fulfill the terms of the agreement. Bummer, but at least I no longer had anything of value for him to attain. Except my research, that is. \n\nWe can't have the whole of the human race turning immortal, it would be a disaster for the heaven, earth, and hell!  So we decided to sign a new deal, and that's where we are today.  My second deal with Satan is about to be finalized. While he can't have my soul, I have agreed to remain the single immortal human. In exchange he agreed to honor my original request and supply me with an endless supply of currency once again. \n\nWhat can I say? Being broke and homeless for eternity just wouldn't be any fun...\n",

            "comment": "His visitor was impeccably dressed.\n\nDr. Ambyth was hard at work in his lab, attending to the numerous vials of chemicals and buzzing machines that populated the counters and workbenches. Dividing his attention between each one was certainly a trying process- more than a few batches had been ruined by less than a gram of mismeasured telomerase. Creating eternal life was never bound to be an easy task, and it had taken him fifteen years to do it. But in the end, he had done it, and now Ambrose R. Ambyth was a trademark name, printed on the syringe that doctors used to deliver liquid immortality straight to the bloodstream of the plutocratic bloodsuckers that gave him a job.\n\nHe was rich and famous, sure, but he couldn't just stop making it. His buyers demanded a fresh batch by Wednesday, and even he, crafter of eternal life, was a slave to the economy.\n\nWhich is why he was so irritated when he heard the door ring.\n\nAt first, when the buzzer rang, Ambrose ignored it. Then, when it persisted, he marched angrily over to the door and flung it wide, intent on verbally reaming whoever dared to intrude upon his work.\n\nThe man was dressed in a simple black suit with a white undershirt, and resting around his neck was a simple necktie which was a soft, dark green. His face seemed youthful, but weathered. Despite the rather plain features he had, each movement, each piece of clothing and strand of hair seemed to be calculated and precise. It unnerved Ambrose.\n\n\"Greetings,\" he said in a soft, deep baritone. \"I presume you are Dr. Ambyth?\"\n\nAmbrose nodded. \"That I am.\"\n\n\"Good,\" the man said simply. He walked past Ambrose into the laboratory, examining the chemicals and equipment around them.\n\n\"Fascinating,\" the man said. \"So complex, yet so elegant.\" He turned to Ambrose, who had started ruffling the tuft of slicked-back brown hair on his head. \"We are quite impressed by your work. I never would have thought a human was capable of this.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" Ambrose demanded. \"Who is this 'we' you speak of?\"\n\n\"Ah, forgive me. Where are my manners?\" He reached out to shake Ambrose's hand. \"You may call me Vellaunus.\"\n\nAmbrose shrunk away from this being called Vellaunus. \"Why are you here?\" The doctor spoke tersely and suspiciously, but the spirit gave him no heed.\n\n\"I am one of the Ferrymen. I ferry the souls of those destined to die to the afterlife, and now, my dear Dr. Ambyth, it is your time to go.\"\n\nAmbrose laughed, a short, startled yelp. He was a spirit of Death! He was in no danger at all! Ignoring the nagging voice of his logic, he decided to flaunt his achievement a little.\n\n\"Oh, there must be some mistake, Vellaunus. You see, I am immortal. I cannot die. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you'll be leaving empty-handed.\"\n\nVellaunus grinned, a subtle hint of smugness escaping into his expression. \n\n\"Oh, trying that card, are you? Well, you see, I admire your achievement. Really, I do. But Fate dictates that today, at 8:53 P.M., you are to pass into the afterlife.\"\n\nThe doctor opened his mouth to protest, but a single gesture from Vellaunus silenced him.\n\n\"You see, normally I would let this one slide. Every few centuries there's one of you that discovers some viable path to immortality, but they're few and far between and they usually deal with themselves more or less on schedule.\"\n\n\"But you arrived at your destination by a particularly unsavory route. A deal with the devil, hmm? He never grants immortality, but you exploited a technicality in a way I wouldn't have thought to do, and I respect that.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, your patron demands an immediate return on his investment. And we're not above using a few technicalities to clean up cases such as these ourselves.\"\n\nAmbrose backed up a step, finding himself leaning backwards on one of the workbenches. He felt a shadow looming over him.\n\n\"But I'm immortal! I can't go to the afterlife if I can't die!\" He spat out the words with more courage than he had.\n\nVellaunus softly shook his head, his expression worryingly grim. He began walking over to Ambrose.\n\n\"Oh, Ambrose. I don't care. Your body, your mind, they can stay here as long as you want. But your soul...\"\n\nAt once, he felt a dark force envelop him. He saw Vellaunus' hand enter his body, passing through his skin as if it were thin air. He pulled something out, a gray wisp, and held it up for the doctor to see as Ambrose collapsed on the ground. He felt empty.\n\n\"Your soul is mine.\"\n\nAmbrose weakly reached up, watching with what felt like his last dregs of humanity as the gray mist exploded in a ball of fire. Vellaunus grinned a smug, wicked smile.\n\n\"One soul, delivered on schedule. You know, a human can live without a soul, but I wouldn't suggest it.\"\n\nAmbrose tried to stand, his vision swimming. The emptiness in him was like the most immeasurable pain he had ever experienced. He watched weakly as Vellaunus switched off the light.\n\n\"If you ever want it back, Dr. Ambyth, you know where to find it.\"\n\nWith a final nod, the man closed the door behind him, leaving Ambrose in darkness.",

I never could have foreseen that,\u201d the man in black purs unconvincingly.\n\n\n\u201cAnd the lengths you went to to get it. When I said unlimited funding, well I meant it, but I couldn't have imagined\u2026 this. Do you know what Singapore looks like these days? You know half the city is testing centers now\u2026\u201d\n\n\nI do know. I don't know what to say about it.\n\n\n\u201cAnd what about Africa? The viral genocides being waged there. You do know those are directly because of your research\u2026 I can tell by your expression the thought had at least occurred to you.\u201d\n\n\nI can't meet his eye. All I can do is stare at my keyboard as he speaks. He continues smiling and starts to count things off on his fingers.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the unrest in Europe. The unabated environmental destruction in China. Those new designer drugs flowing out of the Middle East. The Antarctica situation\u2026 you know demons are my thing right..? Alaska being completely irradiated\u2026.\u201d\n\n\nHe stops counting and smiles right up in my face. His breath is exactly like sulfur. I choke a little on the cliche.\n\n\n\u201cThen of course there's the big one!\u201d His grin widens in a kind of gleeful madness.\n\n\n\u201cYou're to blame for the depression. You poured all that unlimited funding out on anyone who had even an inkling of an idea how to help you. All of that cash entering the economy for the first time. Just suppressing the heck out of the value of, really, any world currency. And now there's starvation, homelessness, a lack of education and infrastructure and that's all because of you\u2026 and me.\u201d\n\n\nHe gestures at my computer screen. On display is a diagram of the molecular structure of one of the drugs in my treatment.\n\n\n\u201cSo this is it then?\u201d His voice is bored and his words show a lack of real understanding. Apparently, the devil is uninterested in biochemistry.\n\n\n\u201cDo you know what it's future is? Do you know what people will do to possess it? It. Will. Be. Bedlam. If you think you got one over on me. \u00a0Let me explain, little one, I have traded one soul for many.\u201d This he extolls gleefully through clenched teeth. Fire licks out around the edges as if to emphasize how satisfying each word is.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to list the rest of the trouble you've caused. You're not in hell so it's not my job to beat you over the head with your, many, sins. But I do want to ask something. One question and that will be the last you ever, and I do mean that, see of me. Was it worth it?\u201d\n\n\nHe grins wider and the very fires of hell leap gleefully behind his irises as I begin to speak.",

Best of all, I had cheated death; I had cheated the devil.\n\nI felt a presence next to me and out of the corner of my eye, I saw the devil himself. I smirked a bit; the last time I had seen him was when we had made the deal. I supposed he was here because I had broken it.\n\n\"You broke the deal,\" he said shortly.\n\nI turned to face him, placing a hand on the counter and shifting my weight to lean on it.

            "comment": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Manw\u00eb Industrial Corporations technically shut down all operations by 9:00 PM each day, but only the corporates payed any notice. The parking lot vacated of all but a few cars, Doctor Robert LaFollette savored a cigarette in the walkway of the HR building. The harsh, incandescent light buzzed overhead, light beating down on his shoulders with a weightless fury, turning his gray hair snow white, accentuating the lines on his face. \n\nHe stared at his reflection in the windowpane. The lights inside were all switched off, the stark contrast painting his image deep into the glass. His eyes hammered him like rivets, soft blue turning oily black in the tint of the darkened windowpane. Smoke curled form his cigarette, and as he watched it caress his face in the window he swore he could feel it lick across his cheeks. \n\nIt felt good on his rosacea. The folliculitis had set in and throughout the day he struggled to keep from scratching his face raw. There was no sign of it in the reflection. His skin was dark, covered in shadow, and in his stillness there was a lifelessness to it. Sunken, sallow, gray and wrinkled. Those damn black beady eyes poured into his, like oil spilling into the sea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I feel too clever anymore, Doctor LaFollette.\u201d his reflection crooned. \n\u00a0\nRobert stumbled backward, catching himself on the handicap guide rail, feet slipping on the steps. He cursed and dropped to the ground. The metal guide rail had dug sharply into the outside of his hand, and he cradled it to his chest while lines of pain shot up and down his palm. His reflection stepped over the windowsill and, bracing one arm around his back, hoisted him back to his feet and batted the dust from his coat. \n\nThe doctor nodded, sighing. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nThe doppelganger stepped to the middle of the entryway. \u00a0Standing directly under the light, it flared out around him, slowing down it arced to avoid touching him, leaving him painted only in the soft, shadowy glow that he emanated. He ground the smoldering cigarette into the ground with his boot, expression humored he spread his arms out wide.\n\n\u201cIs this some sort of mockery, good doctor? I thought it above you.\u201d\n\nThe doctor sighed. It was about time He made an appearance. \u201cFunny,\u201d Robert muttered, fishing around for the rest of his packet in his inside coat pocket. Extracting it, he removed another cigarette and put it to his lips. \n\n\u201cGive me a light, would you, Lucifer.\u201d\n\nThe devil snapped his fingers, and a small flame burst forth from his fingernail. He held out his hand and Robert leaned down and dipped the cigarette into the fire. Straightening he pulled it from his mouth, blowing a long train of smoke and leaning back against the wall.\nLucifer watched him a moment. Robert found it strange to watch his own features contort independently of his will. The expressions were both intimately familiar, and completely alien. Every shape, every alignment was correct, but it was like watching a mortician set the face of a corpse before a funeral. The expressions didn\u2019t quite seem real, they didn\u2019t quite seem alive. And they weren\u2019t.\n\nFolding his arms, the devil leaned against the wall beside him. \u201cColor me impressed, doctor. I find it difficult to even rally any anger. I am simply in awe.\u201d He glanced about him, and then leaned in conspiratorially. Robert was sure he would have seen those eyes twinkling if there were anything living behind them. \u201cYou have made yourself a god.\u201d\n\nThe devil barked a short laugh. Then a longer one. He nudged the doctor\u2019s ribs. The odd juxtaposition of his face aged up, and his movements aged down almost made him sick. \nLucifer fell back against the wall, roughly, bouncing slightly as he collided. His face was in an ugly twist, battling between furor and delight. \n\nHe wiggled his finger at the doctor, pursing his lips. \u201cYou dirty ol\u2019 rascal, you!\u201d Then he laughed again, and shook Robert\u2019s shoulder. The doctor stared blankly across the narrow entryway, mouth hanging open slightly. His mouth felt dry.\n\n\u201cSo, what are you going to do next, doctor?\u201d queried Lucifer. \u201cYou\u2019re practically a brand new god. It\u2019s tradition to go on a tear. Montecarlo? The Maldives? Bora Bora? All the money in the world, and all the time to spend it.\u201d The devil winked. \u201cYou think you might bring me along part of the way?\u201d Then he cackled.\n\nRobert nodded his head absentmindedly. His cheeks had begun to itch again, and he brought his hand to them and scratched. He felt tired. He should have been in bed by now. Much longer and he\u2019d have to wake up three times before morning to throw a piss. \n\nFootsteps clacked across the parking lot, followed by a pair of voices in conversation, and two chemical engineers from the environmental sciences department strode between the sparsely packed cars. They called out to Robert, bidding him a good night. If either of them saw his hellish doppelganger, they didn\u2019t comment. \n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019ll it be?\u201d \n\nRobert LaFollette took the cigarette from his mouth and stood up from the wall. Taking his cane from the bannister, he thrust it against the concrete walkway and pushed his spine straight, turning to face the devil, the ombratic face still smiling at him. \n\n\u201cIt will be nothing.\u201d\n\nThe devil furrowed his eyebrows, turning away from him with a puzzled expression and quickly looking back. \u201cThat seems a bit of a waste of your victory, don\u2019t you think, Doctor?\u201d\n\nThere was a crash. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my victory, damn you.\u201d\n\nThe devil\u2019s expression went blank. Robert stood breathing heavily, the rest of his face reddening to match his cheeks. Calmly, Lucifer turned his head, eyes resting on the smashed window into which Robert had thrust his cane. \nThe old doctor closed his eyes and took a deep breath, and in that moment felt the smothering weight of death, and the ambient heat of the thousand fires of hell, and he felt it stop just before him, bending around him like the light bent around the devil. His eyes opened, and chips of deep blue stuck into oily black with the cold, deliberate fury of a miter. He stood tall, the rippling strength of all his years come unto him, and in that moment he stood before death his defier, his conqueror.\n\nBrightest flame, though, burns most quickly, and Robert deflated, and felt his age wash over him like an algal bloom. Furious tsunamis dried into little more than swampwater, and they regarded the devil in emptiness.\n\n\u201cWould you call it a victory to achieve apotheosis at the expense of your humanity? Is it victorious to spend week after week, year after year, all day and all night buried deep within a clandestine laboratory? Your wife left alone to wonder after you, sitting tall at the dinner table each night, dolled up, a three course meal a table, waiting until well past midnight hoping that maybe this is the day you come home.\u201d\n\nHis voice wavered. \u201cWould you call it a victory to come home that one night and find her gone. Your friends and family unwilling to speak to you, or tell you where she went.\u201d\n\nThe two stood there in silence, the devil\u2019s face unreadable. No tears fell from the doctor\u2019s eyes, nor did they swim or shake. He had done all his crying decades ago. \n\n\u201cForty five years ago I called to you, and you bid my call. Forty five years ago you offered me limitless resource in exchange for my soul, that at the end of my life regardless of the cleanness of my soul I would be yours for all of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cForty five years ago I knew I could beat you. I would escape death and escape your realm of the damned, and Peggy and I would ride off into the sunset, walk the the Appalachian, take a drink from the Nile River, lay a track on the Golan Heights.\u201d\n\n\u201cForty five years ago I could run the mile in under six minutes. Forty five years ago I could climb the Devil\u2019s Thumb. Forty five years ago I didn\u2019t have arthritis in my knees, or cancer in my lungs, or dementia in my brain.\u201d\n\nThe old doctor swapped his cane from left to right, and shuffled away from the smashed window towards the short flight of steps leading away from the entryway. The devil watched him go, face still unreadable, and shifted against the wall so that he remained facing him.\n\nRobert stopped before the top step, turning back a quarter-circle. \u201cA young man may have eternal youth, but an old man has eternal caducity.\n\nHe spit out the cigarette, it landed on the concrete between them. Robert LaFollette nodded to the devil, \u201cStamp that out for me, would you.\u201d And then he left.\n\nThe devil stood there in the dark, his surroundings bathed in light. Crickets chirruped from the grass across the lot, and the faint breath of highway traffic floated across the relative softness of the night. \nHe stepped forward. The cigarette lay between his boots. Scratching the to along the ground, he brought his right leg in, and stomped the ball of his foot down on the roll, grinding it into nothing. \n\nHe looked out from the entryway, silhouetted in the harsh lamplight. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you around, Doctor LaFollette, \u201d and then he was gone.\n\nThe lamp winked out. \u00a0\n",

She turned around, to see an elegantly dressed figure sitting on her table, slim and tall, with no skin, and weird protuberances where they shouldn't been. Just as unnerving as she remembered.\n\n-What happened? Won't you at least welcome an old friend? -All her instincts screamed to run away, to get far and to hide from that thing. But she was stronger than that, she was now stronger than anything. She looked It straight to the face, to be greeted by a pair of sharp, glowing eyes, and a sad, almost nostalgic grin.\n\n-What do you want? I did not call you.\n\n-I came to greet you, of course. -It chuckled- Not every day someone kicks me out of my job, after all. By the way, what happened to your old coffee maker?\n\n-I dumped it when I got a new one. Now tell me what do you want or go away.\n\n-Don't you understand? What I want is to people to die. It is my purpose, the entire reason I even exist. And that won't be happening again. Never. I no longer have a meaning. The souls in hell will eventually burn out and become numb to all, but I will still be there. Waiting for something that won't come again.\n\n-Why are you here then?\n\n-Simple. You owe me. You owe me an eternity of suffering. -He stood up - And I will get it from you. Dead or alive.\n\nMonths later, there was a funeral.",

            "comment": "I sat at the edge of the lakefront in the dark. The howl of the wind across the landscape was the same no matter what now that the Sun was dying in this quadrant. When I first drank the drought that made me invulnerable to sickness and aging I thought I'd find some relief from my own unhappiness at the other edge of eternity. Now a few million years later and departed Terra for Gliese 581c I only cursed my fear of the abyss.\n\nLouis Cypher sat next to me at the pier overlooking the water. We both said nothing to each other. There was nothing to say. I never asked him who else had partaken of the draught and what they'd done to reap their souls at the end.  I gave up on humanity after trying to save them, being feared by them, then hated. I had doomed myself and them as well a long time ago. Louis' beautiful ethereal face serenely looked into the small pond and smiled at their reflection. The fallen angel looked at me without passion, malice or cruelty, and took my hand as the star in the sky flickered out and true darkness enveloped me.",

            "comment": "The day after i discovered the secret to immortality, I had gotten a letter in the mail. The envelope and paper were in red and the writing in a dark black. While hard to read I had a hunch it was the devil. I sat down to read his letter:\n\n\u201cCharles Budworth, it has come to my attention that you have discovered an anomaly in the life cycle. Normally I would say congratulations, because those anomalies are always ways to kill humans. That\u2019s where Mr. Nice Guy ends for you, however. Let me strike a new deal with you, Budworth. Give up on your immortality and pursue something different or face my wrath. There are no middlemen. I suggest you hurry your choice.\n\n\u201cSincerely,\nLucifer IV.\u201d\n\nLike hell I was going to give up on my greatest discovery, Lucifer\u2019s letter only wanted me to go further down this rabbit hole, it had to be done. I made haste to the lab and was ready to make my secret go viral, until my email had gotten a message. Probably the devil again, most likely to say some satanibabble and how I\u2019ll be damned for all eternity. At the worst my immortality will wear off by the hundredth year, and by then I\u2019ll have lived a full life, he can piss off. \n\nI opened the vial full of my mix, and I wanted to drink it but..I couldn\u2019t. I just couldn\u2019t force myself to even down a drop. Was it the devil\u2019s work? Likely. If so why was i receiving more emails? Why was I hearing phone call after phone call? Why was my doorstep overflowing with red letters straight out of a Harry Potter film? I had several questions; but maybe if I just drank my bloody vial maybe that two-horned bastard would finally shut up and just knock on my door like a civilized person. And so I did. Downed the whole bloody vial\u2019s worth. Didn\u2019t feel anything yet but that was supposed to happen anyway.\n\nI had waited for five minutes by now, nothing still happening; until I heard a knock on my door. I got up to answer the door, lo and behold through my peephole was a dragon\u2019s eye, surrounded by scaly red skin and a tar black brow with anger irradiating endlessly. \n\n\u201cBUDWORTH,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cANSWER THIS DOOR.\u201d\n\nDesperate to still have my head on my shoulders I put on my best old housekeeper voice; \n\n\u201cSorry love, b-b-but mister badsworth is not here right now..c-can I schedule you an appointment with him tomorrow??\u201d The exchange only angered him more.\n\n\u201cI WILL *NOT* BE DENIED, HUMAN. *ANSWER THIS DOOR!*\u201d\n\nI unlocked my door, awaiting my now inevitable demise. I laughed nervously. \u201cLovely day, eh Lucifer old chum?\u201d He had grabbed me while with just his hand, it was a miracle he even made it through my apartment\u2019s corridors. \u201cT-tea?\u201d I hopelessly gagged. \n\n\u201cI HAVE NO TIME FOR YOUR PETTY PLANT WATER, HUMAN.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood for stress, no?\u201d\n\n\u201cYOUR ATTEMPT AT HUMOR IS SICKENING, AND FOR FINDING AN IMPOSSIBLE LOOPHOLE IN OUR DEAL YOU SHALL PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE.\u201d An inferno had opened up beneath us. I could see it clearly that he was going to shove me down into hell by force. I probably deserve it, after all I did unnecessarily throw a bunch of crabapples at my neighbors as a lad. He raised his fist with me in it and i was heading for pitchforks and blazes. But there was strangely only one problem. I wasn\u2019t going down like he hoped. Lucifer attempted to shove me in again with no luck.\n\n\u201cW..WHAT!?\u201d He yelled. \u201cWHY MUST YOU TEST ME, HUMAN!?\u201d\n\n\u201cI..drank the immortality thingy?\u201d\n\nLucifer growled. \u201cYOU WIN THIS ROUND, HUMAN. BUT I HAVE ANOTHER WAY TO PUNISH YOU, ONE THAT SERVES YOUR NEW STATE OF BEING....\u201d with his free hand he snapped his fingers, leading to a flash of light. \n\nI awoke to the sound of cheery American pop music. The kind that was also really cheesy. It was also really crowded, making me feel boxed in. I tried to move but I was surrounded by some funny smelling plastic. I looked up to see some red and white writing, supposedly....oh. I saw what was going on, and it explained why I felt all greasy anyway. I think I was going to be in the back of the Twinkies aisle for a long long time.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s just before noon when the knock comes at the front door. I\u2019ve been expecting it, but my hand goes to the pistol just the same, even though i know who it is. Even though I know that the gun wouldn\u2019t be of any use. I always wear it these days, even at home. It\u2019s a comfort thing. I stand away from the door, gun in hand, and call out, in my toughest-sounding voice, \u201cIdentify!\u201d \n\nReflexively, i brace myself for the boom of a shotgun blast coming through the door. It is reinforced, but one never knows these days. The animals beyond that door are hungry, and they are wily, and they have bigger guns than mine.\n\n\u201cPrime Delivery,\u201d comes the reply, as expected. \u201cYour grocery order.\u201d He sounds young, and nervous.\n\n\u201cJust leave it in front of the door, thank you,\u201d i call out. Just because this boy has gotten a job running same-day deliveries for the few remaining prime customers in this area doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he is trustworthy. Safety first. That\u2019s how i still have this nice home to live in, and a working computer to order groceries from. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve stayed alive all these years. \n\n\u201cAnd what lovely, long, enjoyable years they\u2019ve been,\u201d Lucifer says pleasantly as he strolls into the front room from the kitchen. He\u2019s been listening in on my thoughts again, obviously. \u201cAll your rules, all your precautions. Never one for taking unnecessary risks, were you?\u201d\n\nI am trying not to listen, peering out through the peephole to see that the delivery boy has gone and the coast is clear, opening the door just enough to get the three large bags inside then slamming it shut behind me. Trying not to listen, but then he does have a way of making himself heard, doesn\u2019t he? Always did, even when one doesn\u2019t want to think about what he had to say. \n\n\u201cI took a risk once,\u201d I reply. \u201cWhen I met you. I\u2019ve lived to regret it. Haven\u2019t seen a need to take another one since.\u201d\n\nAnd so it is. Because we cured just about everything, didn\u2019t we; or rather I did, with his help. Cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, heart disease, all those other organs. All those diseases. And, finally, aging itself. All things of the past, now, thanks to the limitless time and money he gave me, just as promised. Everything cured, that is, except getting shot in the face at your front door by gangs of marauders. So. Precautions.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you miss it?\u201d Lucifer asked, helpfully picking up the smaller of the three bags and bringing it into the kitchen.\n\nI sigh, following him into the kitchen. Not much point in engaging him. Not much point, either, in trying to ignore him. He\u2019s not going away. None of us are. \u201cMiss what?\u201d\n\n\u201cDanger,\u201d he says, and in his mouth the word sounds intoxicating. \u201cThe thrill of knowing that it\u2019s all temporary. The urgency of feeling that what you long for can\u2019t wait. The sweet ache of knowing the things you love can\u2019t last forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with lasting forever?\u201d I ask defensively.\n\nHe pauses, looks at me with a slight smile.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re down below, I\u2019ll remind you you said that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ended suffering. I ended the pain of loss. Someone had to do it. Only I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d he replies, taking a box of ammunition from the grocery bag and placing it in the pantry. \u201cAnd how they love you for it.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve been over this, over it and over it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have known what would happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might have *guessed!* Nobody dying? Anywhere? *Ever?*\u201d he asks, opening his eyes wide and gesturing dramatically with a bottle of synthetic wine from the grocery bag. \u201cWhere exactly did you think they would all *go?* What did you suppose they would all *eat?*\u201d\n\n\u201cThat part wasn\u2019t my department,\u201d i reply wearily. This argument, this dance, it\u2019s one we\u2019ve performed a thousand times before, a million times. It is, after all this time, one of the few things we have left to talk about. Nothing to talk about but what has been done, and nothing but all the time in the world to talk about it.\n\nThis is my life now. This is my hell.\n\nIt\u2019s been about a hundred a fifty years since the final discoveries were made, and we published our results. No more need for disease, we had proudly proclaimed, nor for aging. No more slow, painful deterioration of our bodies or our minds, but youth and strength and good health for everyone, for all time. That was what we had discovered, what we had promised. And it was true. For a time. \n\nIt happened first in the cities, as they began to swell, and grow, until eventually everywhere was cities. Empty space was one of the first things we ran out of, even before fuel, before food, though they had followed close behind. \n\nWe had always known that the population would one day outpace our ability to feed and house everyone. What we hadn\u2019t known was that, when it happened, we would have made it impossible to starve to death, to die from exposure. That, once the treatments had been given out, people would be able to just keep getting hungrier, and colder, and meaner, and angrier, and more hateful, and more desperate...and that they would never die from any of it. \n\nAnd, of course, through it all, babies kept coming. The sterilization programs could never keep pace with the birth-rates. A mad, starving, homeless centenarian with the body of a twenty-year-old will, it turns out, still want to have sex. \n\nAnd so it had gone for a few decades. Resource wars. Water riots. General collapse. Eventually though, things sort of levelled out into what those of us left call the Long Calm. Calm, that is, for those of us not outside. Those of us who made our fortunes in medical tech or weapons or water, and who could afford to keep ourselves holed-up in fortified homes, eating food we had ordered online and otherwise keeping our doors locked. Calm enough for most folks to tolerate, anyway. \n\nOf course, most folks don\u2019t have the Prince of Darkness as a permanent houseguest; that privilege is mine alone. I\u2019m special.  Once the Long Calm had set in and people had stopped dying with any frequency, he had simply shown up at the door one day, looking dapper, and bored, and peevish. \n\n\u201cNot much business down below anymore,\u201d he had said. \u201cNo new clients coming in, as it were. You saw to that.\u201d \n\nIt had been some fifty or sixty years since I had seen him last, since that night when he had made his great sales-pitch to me in the parking lot of my laboratory and I, weary and frightened and desperate for any chance to do some good in the world, had signed my name, and kissed his hand, and promised him my eternal soul in return for the money, the time, the resources I needed to change the world forever. Sixty years gone by as he stood at my door, and he didn\u2019t look a day older. \n\nBut then, come to that, neither did I. \n\n\u201cYou said you were mine,\u201d he had said that morning about a century ago, strolling past me, through my doorway and into my home. \n\n\u201cI said my *soul*,\u201d I had replied. \u201cNot my house.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said it was worth any price,\u201d he had said, as fires burned outside my door, and in his eyes, and far, far below us. \u201cYou said you wanted to change the world. And so you have.\u201d\n\nAnd so it is. Decade after decade, locked together in this house, as a dozen billion people outside my door scream endlessly for food and water and revenge. Locked together with nothing to do, but talk, and wait. \n\nStill, he\u2019s tidy, and he doesn\u2019t need to eat of course, and his clothes never seem to need washing. One gets used to it. Given enough time, I think to myself, putting away the last of the food, one can get used to anything.\n\n\u201cNot anything,\u201d he chirps amiably from the living room. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop doing that.\u201d\n\n",

            "comment": "\"Finally! I figured it out! The answer was cabbages the entire time!\" I screamed as the formula ejected itself from the printer. About a year and a half ago I was walking down the street, plastered and depressed after finding out that the Trump Administration cut my funding because Trump said \"Science makes my head hurt.\"\n\nWell, I met a man dressed in white in an alley when I went to take a piss, he told me that he could give me all the funding I needed but I would burn for all eternity. I pondered the thought as I swayed back and forth with my man meat exposed to the man in white. \"Mr. Spooky man, you got a fucking deal!\" I said before I emptied the contents of my stomach onto his shoes.\n\n\nWith a snap of his fingers, a scroll formed in his hands out of fire and smoke \"Sign here.\" The man said with a hiss, as I reached for a pen he stopped me \"With your blood.\" And with the flick of one of his sharp nails, sliced open my palm and let the blood pool in my hand. I don't remember much after that but when I woke up, I was in the lab and a letter sat in front of me.\n\n\nI ripped open the envelope and scanned the letter but all it said was 'Good Luck' in red ink, at least I think it's red ink. I stood up and accessed the database on my laptop, I noticed a notification in the corner. I clicked and almost fainted when I saw the number, all it was was a sideways 8. \n\n\nI walked out of my lab and walked up to the secretary \"Betty, who provided the new funding?\" I asked, Betty read a paper \"A mister Luc Ifer.\" I gulped and walked back to my lab \"it wasn't a dream. Wait, it wasn't a dream!\" I ran out and yelled to Betty \"Betty, order three pounds of Hot Cheetos, 3,000 lab rats, 300 cabbages, and Berreta 92fs. I want to test a theory.\"\n\n\n*4 Hours later*\n\n\nCrates of supplies were wheeled into the lab and sat down, I placed 5 rats into their cages and loaded the pistol. I took two of the cabbages into the CRISPR and broke apart the enzymes that made up the vegetable.\n\n\n*2 hours later*\n\n\nAfter 2 hours of rebuilding and restructuring, I finally synthesized an injection from the Chlorophyll and crossed it with B12 and minute amounts of depleted uranium. I put the new liquid into a syringe and injected it into one of the 2 surviving lab rats out of five in the cage, not to glycerin was not an answer.\n\n\nI took a step back and pointed the gun at the rat with the new injection and fired, the spent shell clanged to the ground as the rat collapsed to the ground. After thirty seconds, the rat stood up and walked about like nothing happened. \"Yes! The answer was Cabbages the entire time!\" I yelled in excitement.\n\n\n\"So that's why I'm in hell.\" I said as I sat at a table with Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Fred Phelps, and Lenin. Fred raised his hand \"So how did you die?\" I laughed \"Oh I'm not dead, you see after discovering Immortality. I decided to put my 'Doom' thesis to work and I managed to open a portal to hell. Now I come here to rub it in Satan's face. You hear that Lucy Goosey!\" I yelled as I reactivated my portal, Satan sighed as he stabbed Kim Il Sun with his pitchfork.\n\nI stopped as I was about to step through the portal \"Hey what do you guys think of Donald Trump?\" I asked everyone within earshot.\n\"Terrible!\" Stalin said as he sipped vodka with his glorious mustache.\n\n\"What an evil man! I mean I know I killed 6 million Jews but who knowing kills the earth?!\" Hitler said\n\nPol Pot stayed quiet since he has no room to talk.\n\nFred Phelps stood up and fixed his hat \"I think he's doing a great job getting rid of them Mexicans and faggots!\" Fred yelled, everyone stared at him, Satan unskewered Kim il sun and stabbed Fred, dunking him into a pit of lava.\n\n\"Hey, we may be evil but we're not fucked up.\" Lenin said as he high fived Karl Marx.\n\nI shook my head as I walked through the portal and closed it behind me. Alright, now to create the BFG.\n\n\"Betty! More Cabbages! I think I'm on to something!\"",

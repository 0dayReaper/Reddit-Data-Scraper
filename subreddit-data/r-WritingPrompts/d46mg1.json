            "comment": "\u201cTurn around, did I find you?\u201d\n\nI giggled as I turned around, and said yes. I can\u2019t quite remember whether I had said it out loud or just in my head.\n\n\u201cI *knew* it, I *knew* it! You\u2019d be here, the clue was in the \u201cmeatballs,\u201d and I knew this was your favourite Italian restaurant. So obviously you\u2019d be here.\u201d\n\nI stood up and walked around to the chair on her side of the table, pulled it out, and beckoned for her to sit down.\n\n*Huh, I guess you really are gentlemanly after all*\n\nI chuckled a little again, though not saying much.\n\nShe looked around the restaurant, which was about half-full: not quiet enough nor loud enough to talk telepathically. It was quiet, but there were too many people around; someone would notice.\n\n\u201cOK, out loud it is,\u201d she smiled.\n\n\u201cOK.\u201d I shyly smiled back, maybe a half-smile. I looked down at the menu. \u201cWell, I know we both want the spaghetti and meatballs. And one Chianti for you, one Peroni for me, yes?\u201d\n\nShe just smiled and nodded. Our food was ordered within a minute of her having been there.\n\nI looked over at her, noticing her dark curls dangling in front of her face, and her constantly smiling eyes. \u201cSo, what now? What do we talk about when we already know most things about each other?\u201d\n\n*Not everything*\n\nThere was a moment of silence, and I just stared at her. I tried to read her face and body language, but I couldn\u2019t quite figure it out.\n\n\u201cHave you ever asked yourself *why* we can do this? How this happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cUhhh....\u201d I suddenly felt ridiculously stupid. \u201cAhhh, I guess...no? I thought it was just one of those things.\u201d\n\nShe looked down and started absentmindedly playing with her napkin.\n\n\u201cWell....we\u2019re siblings. Twins, actually. We were part of a government experiment....they would use extra embryos from IVF treatments...they wanted to know more about twins and possible telepathic communication methods, as well as other forms of psychic abilities. You were frozen for 5 years, that\u2019s why the age difference. They incubated, and then \u201charvested\u201d, me straight away, I was in the first batch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d That was all I could muster. I mean, I had no idea what to expect of this meeting, but this certainly had not been on the menu.\n\n\u201cS-s-so....we\u2019re related? We\u2019re *twins*?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Twins, created at the same time, though one of us was held back for a while, as part of the experiment. They wanted to see what would happen if they changed various factors between twins. I have an identical one as well, but she lives further away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are *more* of us?!?\u201d\n\nShe was about the speak, before I interrupted:\n\u201cWait....wait a minute. Why don\u2019t *I* know anything about this??? I thought we knew all of each other\u2019s thoughts?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah...ummm, I\u2019m sorry about that. But, to challenge the different factors involved, I was the one chosen to learn to control my telepathy. I would attend daily lessons, six days a week, at some weird facility. I never knew where it was, because I would be blindfolded going there. But they taught me various skills, including how to block others out from my thoughts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh....\u201d I felt my face going red. She had heard every single one of my thoughts, including times that...well, thoughts and actions that you wouldn\u2019t exactly want people to know about at the time...\n\nShe laughed. \u201cOh my, don\u2019t worry about that! You\u2019re actually pretty PG compared to my sister.\u201d She laughed a little more.\n\n\u201cAaaanyway...\u201d she wipes some tears from her eyes from her little laughing fit. \u201cI\u2019m here for a more specific reason.\u201d\n\n*Great. No wonder she seemed so quiet in the mind today. I\u2019m not getting all of the messages.*\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s nothing that bad.\u201d\n\nShe smiled, stood up, and held out her hand.\n\u201cCome along with me, I have a gift for you outside.\u201d She seemed genuine, her eyes inviting and warm. I took her hand, and we walked outside. It was a quaint little street, in the older and more touristy part of town.\n\nA car pulled up. The back door open. I felt a sudden pressure on my back, and before I knew it, I had landed face-first in the car. The door slammed shut behind me. I sat up whilst rubbing my painful nose, before going straight for the door handle. The car was locked. Likely child-locked. There was a grill between the backseat and front seats. I see Elisa get into the car, and they immediately start driving. I don\u2019t know who the other person is.\n\nShe looks over her shoulder and straight at me. Again, she smiles.\n\n*Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll like it there.*",

                    "comment": "Epilogue\n\n__\n\nI'm 55 years old, and I've been a barista my whole life. What I'm trying to say is that I've seen my fair share of weirdos in all my years. Like that guy who would only pay using quarters. Or the lady carrying cats on her shoulders. And yet somehow, that couple that came in today maybe the strangest of them all.\n\nI like to think that, with my experience, I can read clients pretty well. These two looked a bit nervous, slightly awkward. Definitely a first date. They kept glancing at each other without saying a word. Not a great sign usually, but they looked strangely happy.\n\nWhen it was their turn to place an order, the guy looked at me straight in the eyes and stayed dead silent. Who does that? After some unbearably long awkward seconds, I had to say something.\n\n\u201cSir? Are you all right?\u201d I ventured.\n\n\u201cOh, right sorry!\u201d He said, as if he suddenly remembered he could talk. \u201cI'll have a Latte, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. And you, Ms?\u201d\n\nNow it was the woman's turn to stare silently at my face. Seriously, what was wrong with these two?\n\n\u201cMs? Can I help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sorry about that. I'll have a Latte too, thanks.\u201d\n\nThe guy laughed and said to her:\n\n\u201cI guess we don't have the hang of this thing yet!\u201d\n\nI almost asked them how on earth did they managed to live their whole life up until that point without mastering something as simple as ordering a coffee, but managed to keep my mouth shut. I quickly prepared their order, hoping they would just leave. They didn't, and instead went to sit at a table.\n\nI guess they really were on a \u201cdate\u201d, if you could even call it that. I swear they were just sitting there completely silent, just looking at each other. Sometimes, for seemingly no reason, one of them started to laugh. Maybe they were escaped mental patients. When one of them spoke only to say \u201cI knew I wasn't crazy!\u201d, I wondered if I should report them to the police or something. I picked up my phone.\n\nBut then I looked at their faces. They looked so happy. Seeing them like this reminded me of the day I met my wife. Once you get past their... quirks, they were a really cute couple. Yeah, they were weird, but it's not like they were hurting anyone. Ruining their day would be a crime. I put my phone back in my pocket.\n\nThey had only exchanged a couple of words in half an hour but they didn't seem to mind.\n\nThey were smiling.\n\nThey got up and left, holding hands. I saw them on the street through the window. They kissed.\n\nI was smiling too.",

            "comment": "I've never believed in the concept of a soul-mate. Yet, despite all my beliefs and ideals, there she stood. The living proof that all I've believed up until now has been a farce. Part of me was relieved, the other, terrified. What could this mean?\n\n\"H-hey...\" I muttered between quivering lips.\n\n\"This must be... pretty bizarre for you...\" she said apologetically.\n\nI could feel my knees shaking. All this time, the whispers inside my head were not made by my own subconscious. Instead, they were made by the woman that stood in front of me. She wore glasses, had short black hair, and was on the short side when it came to height. \n\nShe invited me for some coffee. An offer that I literally, could not refuse. We sat in silence. I awkwardly took sips of my capuccino whilst she merely stared at me clutching her cup in her hands. \n\n\"Y'know I- I always knew you were real...\" she said, finally breaking the ice. \n\n\"How is that even possible...?\" I ask, my hands shaking. \n\nShe merely shrugged.\n\n\"The voice... it was just so real...\" she said. \"I never told anyone what I could hear... I even thought I was insane at one point but... your voice was just so clear in my head... I just knew it couldn't be a hallucination.\" \n\n\"Well... I told my parents about it...\" I said. \"They immediately took me to a psychiatrist and diagnosed me with Schizophrenia... so I guess I'm glad that didn't happen to you...\"\n\nShe looked down at her cup apologetically. I couldn't see her expression, but I could tell tears were welling up in her eyes. \n\n\"Hey... why are you crying?\" I asked. \"Is it something I said?\"\n\nShe looked up at me. Instead of a sad expression, what greeted me was the most beautiful smile, along with tears running down her ivory skin.\n\n\"I'm just...\" she sobbed. \"I'm just so glad you're real...\" \n\nThere was no longer an effort to control herself. Tears flowed down her eyes, and her sobs drowned out the chatter of the coffee shop. I didn't know what to say; what *could* one say in a situation like this?\n\nInstead of offering some kind words, I sat next to her and took her in my arms. She buried her face in my chest and continued to cry.\nPart of me wanted to break down crying too. All of my life I've been told I'm insane but... she was proof that I wasn't. \n\n-\n\nIt had been two weeks since the encounter. The two of us walked down the street at high hours of the night, our hands held together.\nEver since that morning at the coffee shop, it was impossible for the two of us to be apart for a long period of time. We essentially went out every single day after work. I'd always drop her off at her apartment - or she spent the night in mine. Bottom line is, we were now inseparable. \n\n\"Say... don't you think it's strange?\" I ask\n\nShe looked at me confused.\n\n\"Well... we've just met each other but, technically been together since birth...\" I say. \"It's like... we're soul mates.\"\n\nShe gasped as a pink tint rose to her cheeks. \n\n\"I mean... the universe *literally* conspired for the two of us to be together...\" I say. \"and now that we are it just... feels right.\" \n\nAfter that remark, the two of us remained quiet for the rest of the way until we finally reached her apartment complex. \n\n\"Say... I'll see you again tomorrow?\" I ask. \n\nShe nodded. Then got on her tiptoes and planted a kiss on my lips.\nShe dashed inside her building and waved back one last time.\n\nI turned around and began walking home. That's when felt it. There it was again... that familiar little voice I've been hearing all my life. It sounded distant and quiet, but I could still make up the words.\n\n\"I love you...\" the voice muttered. The voice then faded away.",

            "comment": "\"Turn around. Did I find you?\"\n\nI became a stalagmite of dread, paralyzed in place by the voice that reverberated in my head. Clear as the crisp smell of rain on asphalt. Powerful as an shameful orgasm.\n\nI turned around, certain that the Voice -- creatively named, that -- would be naught but my mental illness quixotically tormenting the spinning gears of my mind.\n\n\"You did always have a way with words, but Jesus, take a creative writing class once in a while.\"\n\nI stood, stricken dumb. Additional parts of my psyche and anatomy experienced a cascading series of failures, until I was reduced to \"um,\" \"what,\" and \"uhhhhh...\" as the entirety of my skillset. She laughed. This astonishing, wildflower-scented, scarlet-haired woman in front of me was *laughing.* I could hear her laughter. Why could I hear her? I've never heard anyone make this sound before; only the Voice had taught me these things.\n\nI signed to her. *Who are you?*\n\n\"Wait. You're Deaf? But I -- but I would've known. I should've known, right?\" Her jocund 'I've-found-you' smile turned into a mask of confusion.\n\nTaking care to fully form my thoughts as I was signing them, I told her: *Look, I can hear you, but I thought you were the Voice. You're supposed to be living in my head. Why are you real? Why can I understand your thoughts?*\n\n\"I'm in the same boat as you, I have nooooo idea. It's kind of stronger in one direction, though. I can only hear yours when you're really close to me, but I can feel you listening to me no matter where I go. That's how I found you, actually. I heard you for the first time, here at Lost Beans. I decided to broadcast myself and see who turned around. I, uh, I had no idea it'd be someone like you, I'll be honest.\"\n\n*How do you think I feel?*\n\n\"Granted.\"\n\n*What do we do now? I mean, you're the first person I've ever had a verbal, well verbal-ish, conversation with. I don't know what to say.*\n\nShe put her hands in mine. \"Make some kind of superhero team? I don't know either.\"\n\n*Maybe we should order some coffee. Come up with our secret identities.*\n\nShe laughed. And in an awkwardly cute effort, she slowly signed the phrase: \"I'd like that.\"",

A clawing, yearning, all consuming desperation.\n\nDesperate for anyone to listen to me. \n\"Please Nina... you're.not. real. Ok?\"\n\nI continue forward. Desperate. Like her voice.

I cath her and hold her to me. Nothing has ever felt so right. \n\n\"You're really real?\" I whisper into her hair. Breathing in her scent. Feeling like my heart is a 1000 times lighter, and heavier, all at once. \n\n\"Im really real. I've missed you so much.\"\nI freeze at this. She's been real this whole time. She's real... and she abandoned me. Left me to suffer the hospitalizations; the eltro shock. My whole family has been afraid me. Even in my darkest of days her voice was my haven. But one day it just stoped. 2 years. Its been 2 fucking years.\n\nI push her away. Wiping angrily at my face. \"What do you want?\" She recoils as if id struck her. \"You.\" \nI close my eyes again and hate myself for loving that one simple statement.  \"No.\"\n\n\"Mikey, wai..\" she's saying as i turn around and continue walking. \"Mikey they're here!\" \nI swing back around in time to notice several large men running towards us. I make eye contact with the front man. Than i see it. Everything she's seen, and i know everything she knows. I look at her and she nods. \n\nWe grab hands and we run.",

Why now?\n\nShe laughs, in my head.\n\nNow I see her. Beautiful blue eyes, small face and a sea of hair flowing down her shoulders. She's beautiful. The voice is silent.\n\n\"Hi\" \"Hi\" \"Did you find me?\"\n\nShe smiles awkwardly. \"I guess I did\".\n\n\"Should I ask her?\" \"Yes, do it. I'm right here\"\n\n\"ehm, shall we go for a coffee? I would like to get to know you. The real you.\" \"Yes of course, you silly\"\n\nAs we walk to the nearest coffee shop I notice them staring. The people. They never seemed to do that before. They seem scared. I look around, but there's nothing scary happening.\n\nA man grabs his phone while watching me. I turn to look at the girl I'm walking with. She's walking quickly. Shaking softly.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" I think. \"Do you notice these people as well?\". \"Oh it's nothing, probably have never seen such a cute couple before\" she replies. Unsure what she meant by that I keep walking, I take her hand, just in case, and make it to the coffeeshop.\n\nRight before I open the door I hear yelling, screaming even. People are running away, away from us. Men in uniform run towards us. Why? Is she a criminal? Am I in danger?\n\nOne moment later and I'm on the ground, I look at her. She's staring at me with her big blue eyes while talking with an armed officer. She nods. \"Did you really think it was real?\" the voice in my head asks. I'm not sure.\n\nAs I'm placed in my cell I ask the guard why I need to be locked up. He looks at me and scoffs. \"Hm, why don't you tell me, mister?\". \"I.. I don't know\". \"You really don't? Fine.\"\n\n\"You stalked a girl and kidnapped her forcing her to come with you with the knive you had in your pocket. You were dumb enough to do it in broad daylight though, so everyone present were able to give crystal clear statements. You said she was \"the voice\" while grabbing her arm and running towards a coffeeshop. A coffeeshop for fucks sake, whatever would you do with her there?\"\n\nAs the cell door closes, I hear it again. It keeps repeating, louder and louder. It won't stop. Please make it stop.\n\n\"Did I find you? Turn around\"",

            "comment": "\"Turn around, did I find you?\"\n\nI froze. *What the fuck?* \n\n\"Don't be afraid.\"\n\nStrangers bumped past my shoulders, struggling to get past me. Like a rock in a fast-bubbling brook, I remained fixed to the subway floor. I tried to calm my thoughts. She could hear all of them, after all.\n\nBut curiosity and sheer impulse took over soon enough - she'd invaded my every waking moment. I fought back, but desire forced my neck to turn, slowly.\n\nBehind me, I saw a girl, possibly around 27 or so, staring back at me.\n\n\"Is it you?\" her voice rang through my head, her lips unmoving.\n\n*Yes.*\n\nA grin spread across her face. Suddenly, a flash of panic spread through me. What if she was going to kill me? Destroy the voice in her head?\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that.\"\n\nI cursed myself in my head, before realising she could hear that too. I felt more exposed than ever.\n\nShe sighed.\n\n\"Don't be afraid. It's okay. Way I see it, we have a special bond. I think, somehow, fate brought us together.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow. A man in an orange coat pushed past me angrily.\n\n\"Get outta the way, pal!\"\n\nI remembered where I was and quickly took a seat on a nearby bench. She did the same, still looking at me triumphantly.\n\n\"You see, I was in New York for a conference, but I heard your thoughts and, well, I know you were headed here for a family reunion too.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"I thought I'd come and find you. It was easy enough - you tend to think while you read, so when you read the subway signs I knew where you were headed.\"\n\nI nodded again, somewhat sheepishly this time. There was a long pause, filled with the fairly loud hustle and bustle of commuters on their way to work, punctuated by the screeching of trains and blaring announcements.\n\nWe just looked at each other, lost in each other's eyes. For the first time, neither of us was thinking anything. Silence in our heads. Peace.\n\n\"...well, what now?\" I said softly.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said simply, shifting her gaze to the floor.\n\n\"Look. Just now, we were both silent. For the first time for as long as I can remember, there was peace. And we both know each other pretty well, don't we?\"\n\nShe chuckled. \"Maybe a bit too well,\" she mused.\n\n\"Well, I don't know how to say this, but...\"\n\nHer eyes lit up and a cheeky grin grew on her face.\n\n\"You've already heard it, haven't you?\" I smiled.\n\n*Yes.*\n\nWe got up and climbed the stairs up to the light. By the time the sun kissed our skin with its warmth, we were holding hands and headed to the nearest cafe.\n\nI used to think that she was a curse, but now it's becoming clear. We had something nobody else in the world had; a deep, inexplicable connection that couldn't be explained. I don't know how this is going to work, but this feels right.\n\nJust as I was about to vocalise my thoughts, she caught me in a smile.\n\n*Ah. I forgot you can hear me. This is weird.*\n\n\"We'll get used to it.\"\n\nI squeezed her hand and we walked along the pavement, wet and shining with the sunset's colours, reflected on the stone.",

Most people it's their own voice, they can hear it, speak it, even imagine the words coming out of your mouth. Some people, even think of it as someone else, like Morgan Freeman or something just to play around and have fun I guess. Most people can control their thoughts and inner voice. Not me. My inner voice is her. I can't control it, I can't stop it. Frankly, right now, shes speaking to me.\"\n\n\"And what is she saying Ryan?\" The psychiatrist asked, leaning back in her arm chair. Lethar squeaking, chewing on the back of her pen with a concentrated look on her face, perplexed as to where I was going with this.\n\n\"She's telling me I'm not crazy. Not schizophrenic like you say. That I'm okay. I'm normal.\" I replied, while palming my eyes and rubbing them in frustration. At this point I'm unsure that why, for 37 years... as long as I can remember her inner voice was combating mine. Mentally I'd get into arguments with her, try and ignore her. No matter what I do she knows what I'm doing, saying, even thinking. All the time. \n\n\"To call your self crazy isn't right, maybe it's your thoughts rationalizing your feelings about your schizophrenia. Maybe you are.... trying to come to terms.\" She leaned forward to address me. \n\n\"Yeah.... maybe, maybe I am crazy.\" I was doubting my self, I knew what I told Dr. Skinner was bullshit. I knew it, she knew it, but the court mandated these.... mediations. I call them that because even though on paper its \"helping\" it's just wasting my fucking time. Just get it over with I say. One day it will be over. 25 years later since my episode, I'm still fucking here. Still talking about the same shit. Except shes helping me get through it, but I could never tell Dr. Skinner that. They would lock me away, her and I both knew that, and I had a lawfirm to run. Oddly enough successful people can too have problems of their own. Then again, what's it worth when you talk to nothing but your imagination.\n\n\"Your doubting your self again Ryan. I think your making progress, more and more each day.\" She stated while beginning to type what she has written in her notes. \"I think that's a good place to end until next week. Don't you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, thanks Dr. Skinner.\" I gathered my things and headed out. I knew what she was telling me wasn't what she was actually writing. Oliva knew that as well. That's her name, Olivia. She told me when we were kids. Like she grew up with me. \n\nI walked out on the the busy street. I had to make it back to the lawfirm downtown before lunch was over. I had a meeting with a client who was pressing charges against her company for \"unsafe working conditions\" in reality, I knew it was bullshit, but I had to entertain the bullshit if we wanted to make money. \n\n\"I can take the south express line, should spit me out a block from the lawfirm.\" I thought to my self. \n\n\"Theres a delay Ryan, you'll be late.\" Olivia interjected into my conciousness. \"If you take a cab you'll get there early. Trust me.\"\n\n\"Yeah yeah.\" I spoke out loud, but quietly as to not draw attention. The fact that my thoughts weren't my own, the lines get blurred with what you say and what you think sometimes. It's hard to keep track. \n\n\"Why don't you trust me Ryan?\" Oliva asked, sounding upset. \n\n\"Because, your not real.\" I mumbled but put head phones in. It was a good way for people to, not look. Now a days they just think your on the phone anyway and ignore it. Everyone's face is in the thing anyway, surprised they even know where they are going. \n\n\"Like that! You wont say my name, it's been years since you've said my name.\" She whined.\n\n\"Again, your not real and I'm just having a fucking conversation to my self, and I'm still entertaining it by talkign to you.\" I said as I decended into the subway station. The previous subway car doors shut and I was left relatively alone on the platform, headphones still in. \n\n\"What is it going to take to convince you I am.\" Olivia began to bargain. Funny, shes never said anything like this before. So I decided to play into it, maybe I can.... break my self? I don't know. Maybe stop it from happening. \"And no Ryan, your not going to get rid of me by 'playing into it' again.\" She said before I could finish my thought. \n\n\"One, stop doing that, and two, physical evidence would work. Again, your not real!\" The subway car rumbled up to the station and I entered. I was alone, standing there. The car smelled like must and urine and just.... city smell. I hated it. \n\n\"Well if we meet, we can finally move to the country like you've always wanted. I know you hate this smell. So do I.\" Olive said. \n\n\"Yeah, sure. Let's make it happen then.\" I said to Olivia sarcastically. \n\n\"You don't have to be so sarcastic about it.\" Oliva said with a brashness that I could tell she was upset with me.\n\nThe car began to fill up at the next stop. I wasn't alone anymore. People were around, to many people, and would know I'm talking to my self so I decided to use my inner voice. \"Well I'm crazy Olivia, I can't even take meds anymore because.... because it doesn't work.\" I was frustrated. I gripped the steal bar tighter. \n\n\"Ryan, please stop. I'll prove your not.\" She pleaded. \n\n*Ding* [Next stop, 14th and Albany] \n\nMy stop. The car still barrelling through the subway line, lights flickering and the car shaking and creaking. My hand gripped the steel rail harder. I'm getting angry, not with her, or anything, with my self. All this time I've played into it, what's one more game I guess. \n\n\"Ryan, please. Listen to me.\" Olivia pleaded again, but I ignored her. \n\nThe car came to a halt and I basically ran out of there and up the subway station steps towards the street. \n\n\"Ryan!\" She got louder as I approached the street. I always thought I could outrun my own thoughts. Ever since I was a kid, but I knew it not to be true.\n\n\"Ryan, watch out!!\" Olivia shouted and for some reason I stopped just before I stepped into the street. A bus flew by, nearly could have killed me or put me in the hospital. \n\n\"Oh fuck!!\" I exclaimed, hands on my knees breathing hard and heavy. \n\n\"Hey buddy you okay? You almost got flattened!\" A stranger asked me who was next to me at the cross walk. \n\n\"Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.\" I replied. \"Thanks.\" \n\n\"Well sure but thank that lady who yelled to you.\" He stated. \n\nMy heart sank.\n\n\"What did you say?\" I looked him dead in the eyes. I thought I only heard that. \n\n\"Turn around Ryan. Please.\" Oliva said inside my head, and this time out loud. It was her, long brown hair, blue eyes, exactly how she was in my dreams as a kid. \n\n\"Hi Ryan, it's good to finally meet you.\" Olivia smiled a beautiful smile that made me smirk.\n\n\"Hey buddy, you.... you uh... see her.... right?\" I asked the stranger next to me. \n\n\"Of course, she looks beautiful, hard not to notice.\" He chuckled. \"Oh excuse me.\" He said to a woman he bumped into as we walked across the street and she replied to him. I knew he was real too. \n\n\"Yes Ryan, hes real, I'm real.... your not imagining any of this and your not crazy, and I know your thinking 'did I get hit by the bus and now I'm dreaming this or dead?' But you didn't and this is real.\" Oliva knew what I was thinking still because that's EXACTLY what I was thinking. \n\n\"You're.... you're real!!\" I exclaimed as we both lurched forward and held and kissed each other. \n\n\"Don't cry Ryan, I'm hear now. I'm not going anywhere, never. I love you, I always have and I never lied about that. Not once!\" Olivia comforted me and pressed her head against my chest. \n\nI'm not crazy. It's real. She's real. The woman of my literal dreams is real. I don't know if I manifested her. I don't know where she came from. She has a family. Shes been alive and has a life. I don't know if we were two souls who were connected in a past life. If that's something you believe in, or we were always destined to be together. We don't know. Probably never will. I know she's perfect. Everything I've ever wanted. Like she fell from the heavens. This is the happiest I've been in the 37 years on this floating rock in the vast nothingness that is our existence. Now I know....\n\nI'm not crazy. \nShe's real. We are real.\nI'm not crazy.\n\n....I'm not crazy....",

            "comment": "\"Wh- who are you?\" Jennifer asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer was alone in her kitchen, making some scrambled eggs when she heard *that* voice. When she turned around, there was a little girl standing by the doorway in front of her with blonde hair and a distinctly red ribbon. She looked just like a doll, wearing a pink dress, which made it even creepier as to how unnaturally perfect she looked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe voice sounded in her head again, an innocent and cheerful voice of a little girl, a voice she has grown all too familiar with all these years. \"Your friend! I know all about you as I am sure you know. I know about your favorite food, what you think of everyone you've met, and I always know what you want to do.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe combination of the young girl's unmoving mouth and the cheerful voice in Jennifer's head gave her the chills. Jennifer heard the same voice again, but this time it came out of the little girl's mouth. \"No need to be so scared and anxious! If it makes you feel any better, I can speak through my mouth as well.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer felt relieved at least, that the girl and the voice were actually the same entity, and that the girl was not just like a dead doll. Jennifer crouched down and grabbed the little girl's shoulder and felt a warm sensation flow through her arm. *She was really here*, Jennifer thought. Initially, Jennifer hoped that this little girl before her was just her seeing things. Now, she was even more weirded out and had even more questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe little girl smiled and said, \"Of course I am here! I guess you could say I am just as alive as you are.\" She skipped over to beside Jennifer and hugged her leg, \"I am just so glad I finally found you! Also, don't worry, you're not schizophrenic.\" The little girl affectionately took off her red ribbon and tied it around Jennifer's ankle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was the first time today Jennifer saw the little girl act as if she were a little girl. Also, Jennifer felt relieved that she was not schizophrenic. However, as soon as that feeling came up, she quickly dispelled that feeling of relief as she thought, *Leave it to the voice in your head to tell you that you are not schizophrenic.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe little girl slowly let go of her leg and sat down cross-legged on the floor. She stared at the floor in concentration, with her brows slightly furrowed, and Jennifer could hear her voice in her head, *Now, how to explain this so she doesn't panic?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer sat down on the floor in front of the little girl and asked, \"Explain what?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe little girl looked at Jennifer and smiled, \"Well... I'm your guardian angel.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe smiled wryly and continued, \"So I was kinda new to the job and all. Also, I heard some older guardian angels joked around about how easy their job would be if they could just hear the thoughts of the one they were guarding so they could take some precautionary measures.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer exasperatedly said, \"So basically, you did this to me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer heard the voice speak in her head frustratedly, *I knew this would happen. Okay, okay. Damage control time.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe little girl swayed back and forth and said, \"I mean, it was more of an accident if it makes you feel any better. You see, I *miiight* have just found a sealed black book with some glowing eyes on the cover, and it also had a spell to connect us.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer raised an eyebrow and asked blandly, \"Let me guess, there's a catch.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer suddenly hear the voice scream in her ear, *Damn! She asked about it!* Jennifer winced and quickly covered her ear, glaring at the little girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe little girl waved her arms and said, \"Ahhh, sorry about that. So, yeah. There is a teeny little small catch. We are kind of linked together. I die when you die and so on. I was not supposed to be able to get an unaging human form that is immortal and stuck at age 7. Furthermore, since I received a human form, I somehow appeared on a random place on Earth.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer could hear the voice mumble, *I am so glad I did not appear right on top of a volcano.* The girl continued, \"So, anyways, once you leave this human plane, I can move on as well! On the bright side, you can be a guardian angel too!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer felt her right ankle grow increasingly hot, to the point where it felt like burning. Jennifer tried tugging the red ribbon off, but it seemed as if it was melded together with her leg.  Jennifer thought, *What the hell is going on?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe little girl laughed cheerfully, \"Oh, we're just switching bodies. I found out about this spell in the ominous spell book I used to merge us together initially. I am sure this spell fixes what I have done to merge us beforehand. I am so done with this young body. Did you know you can't buy an airplane ticket at age 7? Why do you think it took me 30 years to get here?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer felt her vision grow blurred, and she blacked out. A few moments later, Jennifer opened her eyes and discovered that she was in some village. There were small concrete buildings, each with a small courtyard at the entrance. The roads were all dirt and people rode worn-down bikes instead of cars. The strange thing was that all the buildings and people seemed taller than she was used to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe glanced at her ankle and found no ribbon to her relief. However, Jennifer's expression distorted once she felt a ribbon on the top of her head. Jennifer eavesdropped and heard the villagers speak in a strange language she has never heard before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJennifer thought, *Where the hell am I?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe heard a response in her head: The sound of a baby's cries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading! Suggestions and comments would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "\"I can't believe that I've found you!\" she screamed. Her face was practically glowing, she was so excited. She ran forward and leapt into my arms, and before I could even think to react her voice was resonating in my head. \n\n\"*And don't you even think of dropping me, butterfingers! I remember how you dropped your first girlfriend*.\" \n\nMy arms reflexively came up. Just in time too. She collapsed into my arms. Her arms latched around my neck, but she didn't put any effort into keeping herself up. \n\n\"Cori?\" I asked. But it couldn't be. The girl in my head wasn't real. I've had schizophrenia since the day I'd been born. Sure, the medicine did nothing to help it, but then again...\n\n\"Of course it's me!\" she chirped. \"And no, you're not schizophrenic. Otherwise...\" \n\n\"*I would be, too*.\" \n\nAnd there it was. The voice that responded to my every thought. Smooth and melodic and just a little deeper than average for a girl. The same voice that comforted me when I broke up with my first girlfriend, and helped me with my math homework. \n\n\"Is it... it's really you...\" Tears had come to my eyes. I tried to wipe them, but a soft hand and even softer tissue was already dabbing at my face. \n\n\"Yeah,\" she said. Her voice was softer than the brash and explosive timbre I was used to, but I couldn't fault her on it. This was an emotional time for both of us. \n\nJudging from the adorable, wry smile that felt oddly in place on her, I could tell that she agreed.\n\nOh, and judging from the way that she was suddenly interested in anything but me told me that she was blushing from my thoughts. \n\n\"You're a jerk,\" she whispered. I laughed. She already knew that. She heard my thoughts for the last 37 years. \"I expected you to be taller.\" \n\nI winced. She knew that would hurt. Then again, I didn't expect her to be this pretty. \n\nThe blush on her face made me smile. Looks like I'm still the better heckler. God, it was amazing to finally be able to see the reactions on her face. It was also amazing to know that I wasn't crazy. \n\nBut more than all of that? It was nice to hold a friend. I hugged her tighter, and swore to myself that I would never let her go. \n\nI didn't need to read her mind to know that she thought the same. The way her grip on my neck tightened told me enough.",

            "comment": "I already knew.  Her voice had been growing louder in recent weeks.  She said she would find me.  I knew she would, one day.  It was all that gave her purpose.  I was.  She had nothing left.  Except me, the one who was always there but never 'really' there.  The one who failed her.  I might as well have killed them all myself, she would tell me, black eddies of loss and hatred roiling over from her into me.  She wasn't wrong.\n\nIt used to be so faint.  The first time I noticed that I sometimes had another voice in my head I was maybe six, but it was probably there even before that.  I just didn't understand what it was before then.  Even at six, it was soft and indistinct enough that it felt like it came from my own mind, that she was just some neglected part of my being gently calling for my attention.  Like my feminine side trying to express itself through an imaginary friend, or some other such psycho-babble nonsense.  I think one of my mom's hippy friends came up with that.  \n\nI told my mom everything.  Like everything.  As a kid, anyway.  She always wanted to know what was going on in my little brain.  She said it was so much more interesting visiting my world than living in hers.  So of course she knew about the voice, my invisible playtime partner who was always there.  And that her name was Rosie.\n\nStill, Mom was a pretty easygoing person, so she wasn't too worried about it.  Lots of kids went through this phase.  Just meant I had a better imagination than most, that I was a bright spark in a  dull universe and one day I'd light up like a star in the sky, shining for all the world to see.  She told me that, all the time.  I'm not ashamed to admit that she spoiled me.  More than a little.\n\nSeven, eight, nine.  \n\n\"Well, yes, he's a little old for imaginary friends, but it's not like it's hurting anyone.  He has lots of real friends at school, too, and he's doing very well in all his classes so I just don't see the cause for your concern, Principal Morley...  \n\n\"Yes...  I'm sorry, are you honestly trying to tell me that you think my son is a bad influence on the other children?  He's a model student!  Of course Ms.  Evans thinks he has a disorder, she's paid to think that.  If she had her way, half the student body would be medicated.  \n\n\"Yes, alright, fine!  If it'll make you stop wasting my time with these senseless calls I'll take him for an evaluation.  What was the name again?  Uh-huh.  Okay, thanks.  Yes you have a marvelous day, too.\"\n\nShe shook her head as she hung up, then smiled at me.  It was a smile so free of worry or concern it could have smoothed any frown-lines for twenty miles.  I can't recall seeing it again after that.\n\nTen.\n\nA full year of psychiatric and neurological testing and evaluation.  If I wasn't in a shrink's office I was in an MRI or a doctor's waiting room.  I was deemed unsafe to be around other children.  My ability to differentiate between fantasy and reality was seriously compromised.  I very likely had schizophrenia and there was no telling when I might snap and harm myself or someone else.  Medication would eventually put me on a more even keel.  We would just have to experiment a bit to find the right combination and dosages.\n\nEleven.  Fifteen.\n\nI don't remember being twelve.  Or thirteen.  Or fourteen.  Only fragments of lucidity between different treatment regimens.  Some time after I turned fifteen they found a group of pills that didn't rob me of my soul.  They did nothing to quiet Rosie.  Nothing had.  Rosalyn.  She didn't like being called Rosie anymore.  Not even from me.  Too kiddish.  She had boobs now, for fuck sake.  Rosie wasn't gonna cut it.  Maybe Rose... a little cheesy...  Her boyfriend could call her that maybe, when she got one.  Soon.  \n\n'Jesus Christ... Seriously not interested in your boobs right now.  My head is killing me.'\n\n'Holy fuck!  You're alive!  And you're loud today.  It's like you're talking right in my ear.'\n\n'Watch your mouth please.  My mom's right here.'\n\n'I'm not using my mouth, so there, dickstick.'\n\n'Ha.  Yeah well you might end up using mine by mistake again.  I haven't been this awake in... I don't even know.  You know this whole thing's a little more sensitive coming off some of these drugs.  I really need to look normal right now.  They might let me go home soon.'\n\n'Yeah-yeah.  Fine.  I'll try to keep it PG.'\n\n[... more later, maybe]",

The sound of her voice didn't come from inside. It was external. It scared the shit out of me to be honest, like a tray falling over at a restaurant. Startled, I didn't recognize it at first.

I threw him in the bin. My mother was upset she said why did I throw away my favourite toy. I said he's not my favourite any more.\n\nWhen I was 6, she taught me what violence was. I drew a picture of violence in my class at school. The teacher was upset with me and told me I was wrong. Everything I've learned of life since then assures me I was right.\n\nWhen I was 13 she told me that Gary in my class wanted to kiss me. I walked over to him and kissed him first and it was warm and wet and weird.\n\nWhen I was 15 she told me not to tell anyone what uncle Paul likes me to do with the video camera. She said they wouldn't understand, and I was getting too old for it anyway.\n\nWhen I was 21 she was all I could see and all I could hear. I asked her for some time alone. I bought some flowers for myself but forgot to buy a vase to put them in. I rested them in a pint glass and didn't leave the house as I watched them slowly shrivel over the next week.\n\nWhen I was 25 she came back and I felt a shiver down my spine and I don't know if it was bad or good, but I didn't want to ask her to go away again. So she stayed.\n\nWhen I was 26 she told me that I needed to die so she could live. She told me what to do with the gun. \n\nMy heart stopped for 30 seconds at the hospital. They told me I would be able to talk again with rehabilitative therapy, but that I would be disfigured for life. They told me she wasn't real. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and given a lot of pills to take regularly. They brought me peace. I didn't see her again in a long time.\n\nWhen I was 37 I heard a familiar voice behind me, and felt a shiver down my spine. \"Turn around, did I find you?\" Her speech was slurry and lisped the same way mine was after the incident.\n\nI turned around slowly. She hadn't aged a day the whole time I'd known her, but this time half her face was grotesque and scarred the same way mine was, except the opposite half. She touched me on the arm, and I knew she was real this time.\n\nI was hers again.",

She's a bit shorter than me and looks like the type of girl who has a dozen of devoted admirers who will never be lucky enough to get any romantic attention from her. Her beautiful features are settled in the deepest Frown I've ever seen, one that I know the reason of very well.\n\n- I'm here to talk in person, and you better appreciate me taking the time to find you.\n\n- wellll... Technically my problem is your problem too. \n\nI can't look her in the eyes and just keep my head down, staring at her shoes.\n\nShe sighs and I hear the voice I've gotten so used to again, in my head as always \"listen, I realize that you're a nice guy. I mean you put so much effort into learning French for me just cuz I didn't have enough time to do it myself and asked you... But this is seriously getting out of hand.\" \n\n-it's not MY fault that I have a powerful imagination! I don't even like those stuff, but I just can't control my brain! Come on you know that, plus you've had it happen too. And it's been going on for a while now since you're so occupied with your studies.\n\n-yes but with me it doesn't happen at 2pm when you're at school now dose it? Neither does it happen while at the dinner table ON THANKSGIVING with all your family present. I can't have sex and fettish scenarios just popping up in my head at the most inconvenient of times!\n\nOh now she just had to go there and say it. The picture of her giving me a blowjob sprints into my mind and I have absolutely no way of stoping it. Her eyes widen and she throws her hands up in the air, her cheeks reddening only by the smallest bit of a beautiful paint. I could not possibly be any more embarrassed and flustered or want to punch myself.\n\n-see!!!! What am I supposed to do now, just roll with it or would you like me to add some details to it as well? \n\n-okay okay I get it already! What's your plan to fix it though? It's not like I haven't tried before!\n\nShe takes my arm and starts to forcefully drag me  behind her as she walks with purpose, saying her first out loud words since I've turned around, \" I've scheduled an appointment for you with one of the best therapists in the city. If someone can save me from your untimely interruptions, it's her.\" She pauses, saying after about four seconds \"and of course now you're thinking about a threesome. Come on, the sooner I get rid of this curse the better, and don't you even think about touching my toes, I'm not into that.\"\n\nI can't hide my huge grin though after seeing that she's not that opposed to the idea of the threesome either.\n\n(This is literally my first time writing so I'd appreciate any feedback. Also English is not my first language.)\n\nEDIT: way too many wrong auto corrects and misspelled words. Added some bits too.",

            "comment": "I am a rational person. Some could argue otherwise, but I assure you I am as rational as anybody could expect to be in my situation.\n\nI have schizophrenia. Auditory hallucinations, but I'm doing fine. Well  maybe it isn't fine, but I've been managing it. Things have been working out well now that Ive got my own place. Its quiet, which is good fot me.\n\nI dont have any delusions or detachment from reality. I just hear her. She's never been hurtful or especially negative to me, which I am quite lucky for, but hearing her has caused me immense distress.\n\nI cannot overstate how difficult it has been for me to maintain healthy relationships. Even with a steady diet of abilify and ativan, my antipsychotics and anxiety meds. I just cannot do it. I am simply not capable of it. So I live alone.\n\nI am entirely isolated from others. Theres this gap too wide for anyone to cross between me and everyone else. I know that nobody would ever understand me or know how I feel. Except for her. She's been inside my head, seen it all, and stuck around me this whole time. Even now, I still hear her.\n\nIt wasn't until I had just gotten off of the bus on my way to my appointment with my shrink that I'd ever been scared of her. She'd always been so soothing and comforting to me. I could always turn to her and she would be there for me. We would have full conversations where she would help me and there were times I would help her. I just need you to understand, I had never been scared of her before. Not once.\n\nWell, that day I was fucking terrified. So, I start telling myself: \"You're a rational person, this is a hallucination.\" I was trying some of my grounding techniques, but she fucking scared me.\n\nI had never been so vulnerable. I had been by myself for the past 6 years and then- out of fucking nowhere- I was more vulnerable and open to someone then I ever have been. And all it took was her saying \"Turn around, did I find you?\"\n\nIt was different. It was the only time she'd ever made reference to definitively being somewhere. This was the only chance I had to know for sure if she was real. I needed to know. Like I said, I was being as rational as anyone could be in my situation.\n\nI turned my shoulder and saw a girl, roughly my age, walking behind me. Her eyes widened, and it seemed like she was about to say something before I turned back around. At first I thought she had just been some stranger scared I was about to rob her, so I just kept walking. \n\n'Fine. Now you know she isnt real. Let it go.' I said to myself, walking briskly away. \n\nI didnt dare check my shoulder again before I heard her again.\n\n\"Holy shit. It is you. Hang on-\" \n\nI panicked. It seemed like they were getting worse. So I hastily slung my backpack over my shoulder and begun to dig into the small pocket on the front for my meds. I grabbed my water bottle and sat on the bench, certain I was losing it. I stared at my pills, thinking I could take more than normal in hopes of this deafening my ears to her, so to speak. I thought about running. But, neither of these seemed particularly helpful.\n\nI put my pills back in my bag and sat for a momebt. I heard her speak for the first time. Not just thoughts stuck in my head, but somebody's voice coming from outside. \n\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Are you okay?\" \n\nThe girl I'd seen sat down next to me. Her posture was open, and she looked at me empathetically.\n\n'It's you.' It was all I could muster, but I was sure she would understand. She always understood me.\n\nThe corner of her lips pulled into a small smile. And she nodded reassuringly. \n\nI stared at her. She was exactly how I'd pictured her. Maybe I'd actually known. 'She really is beautiful, that hadn't just been a teenaged pipedream afterall.' I thought to myself. Or us, I suppose.\n\nHer smile widened, and her cheeks reddened.\n\n\"Thank you. It's nice to finally meet you in person.'\n\nNow, it seemed it was my turn to blush. I laughed nervously.\n\n\"Why did you come find me?\" I asked her. I suppose I didn't have to speak at all, but it was a habit you wouldn't think of until you don't need to.\n\n\"Well, I wanted to know if you were actually real too.\"\n\nI smiled. I couldn't say how long we spent on that bench the first day we met, catching up as old friends do.\n\nAll I know is I had never taken such a risk, in being so open and vulnerable to someome else before, and there is not a single decision I have ever been so glad I made. It was the first time in my life, I  wasn't alone.",

            "comment": "\"Turn around, did I find you?\"\n\nI turned around so I could see the voice that had haunted me for my entire life and see a girl, a very young girl, to young. I immediately turned back around and start walking away but she grabbed me.\n\nI spun and watch in horror as the small girl screams out in pain and starts melting. I try to help, cal her down, but at soon as I touch her, she is gone.\n\nI stared for a minute and walk away as if it hadn't happened. I assumed I was imagining it, I mean, nobody else saw it or seemed worried about it, than strange, and also sympathetic looks. Sympathetic? Why?\n\nI didn't know, nor care and just started walking away.\n\nA few days later, I was in my room and I heard the same thing turned around and saw a different girl, around the same age. Again I started to walk away and again she grabbed me, but this time, I didn't stick around to watch her melt away. But I heard her scream.\n\nThis happened time after time, and there seemed to be no pattern other than the girl starting to melt the second we came into contact with them. I started to resent that voice, and that phrase. But time and time again I turned around.\n\nThen, one day, ignored the girl. I just kept on my way. Then the girl ran in front of me. She was older than the rest. Pretty much as old as I was. She reached out to me and said \"I know its you, just acknowledge me! I heard you say not again just please!\"\n\nI rushed back and screamed \"NO DON'T, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT\"\n\nShe looked at me confused for a second. Then screamed.\n\nAt first I thought it was going to end like the rest of the girls. But people where starring now, they acknowledged her existence.\n\nThen everything went black.\n\n I woke up in a strange place. Everything was white. I stood up and saw all the girls, everyone I had seen after hearing \"Turn around, did I find you?\" Even the older woman. We were all dead. All died in school shooting. All the girls were my students and the woman my wife. It was heart breaking realizing what had happened and getting my memories back. But at least none of the girls are alone here.\n\nBut it seemed that it was only us here, no one else was in sight. I reconnected with my wife and the children played in the white stuff we where standing in. It was like sand, but it didn't feel like sand. It felt like... I don't know...\n\nWe then heard a voice. It said that we al were going back, to have new lives and they hoped we didn't see each other again for a long time. Then everything was white and cold. I started crying as the cold air rushed onto my naked body. Then there was a warm sensation and I was being rocked. I still felt off, nothing was right. My memories were slowly disappearing.\n\nThen, all I could think about was now. Now I wanted to sleep. So I started to fall asleep. The rocking was comforting and a woman started singing a sweet and relaxing tune. I fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.",

What if my sickness was now at at new level where I now **saw** things?\n\nIt didn't help my judgement that her voice had been especially loud these past few days, more than usual. Before it had been as if we were in the same room and I could hear her muttering to herself in the corner. But now it was like the distance between us had closed so much it was as if I was in her head. Or that she was in mine.\n\nI started to *feel* emotions that weren't mine. When I closed my eyes, I could almost *see* faint images of places where I physically wasn't. Just that morning I could literally *taste* coffee in my cereal while she wondered aloud if she had put too much creamer in.\n\nI wanted so desperately to believe that it was all real, to know that I wasn't actually crazy, that it wasn't all just in my head. But at the same time I knew that it could all be a product of my sickness, and that my hope could be false. To be telepathically linked? That has the stuff of soulmate fiction.\n\nBut even as all this conflict ran through my mind, I dared to reach out with my mind. To call out with this possibly false hope, that maybe... just **maybe**... this was actually something.\n\n\"*are... are you... real?*\"\n\nMy mind froze as I waited for a response.\n\nAlmost as if popping a bubble, I could suddenly feel it; her disbelief giving way to excitement. Her hope being affirmed. Outwardly, she had her hands over her mouth with the beginnings of a river forming in the corners of her eyes. She reached out with a hand.\n\n\"*It's really you... oh my god.... it's you!*\"\n\nIn a daze, I grasped her hand and actually spoke in a tentative voice, still unsure of everything.\n\n\"Yeah... it's me.\"\n\nHer hand, I could actually feel it. The warmth, it's smoothness, the dips of the scars.\n\nThe scars?\n\nI looked down at the hand I was holding, then further up the arm. There were many, faded from age but there none the less. I can *feel* her take notice, along with the flush of embarrassment.\n\nI know these. Almost twenty years ago. The screams she had.\n\n*You aren't real! You aren't REAL! I'm REAL! I'm the real one! I'm the real one because I can FEEL this!*\n\nShe smiles kindly at me, feeling in her own mind how I pieced it together. Instead of pulling back, she steps forward and pulls my shirt collar down a bit, exposing a deep scar of my own at the base of my neck. Only my parents knew about that scar.\n\nI hear her thoughts in my head. With some melancholy she repeats the very words I had thought to myself that night.\n\n\"*It'll stop with this. It'll stop. It won't be real after this.*\"\n\nThe words cut though me, but not in the way that hurt. The dam breaks, and the tears surge forth. We embrace, relishing every sensation it brings.\n\n\"*But I am real, and you didn't stop.*\"\n\n\"*And I'm real, and you can feel me.*\"\n\nFor a short while we remain together with no words, only our emotions that cascade over each other.\n\nWe separate. She wordlessly asks if I want to go to a cafe nearby. I agree in kind.\n\nWe have so much to think about. Together.",

I smile and breathe a sigh of relief as the hands walk me to the squad car. Peace at last.",

She'd undoubtedly seen the terror and shock in my eyes, but I attempted to hide my recognition. Immediately walking in her direction, I attempted to make it apparent that I'd been looking at someone behind her.\n\nMy diversive mark was an elderly woman that was ambling across the sidewalk. \"Ma'am,\" I said, \"you're the spitting image of my grandmother.\"\n\nShe looked to me with joy in her eyes, obviously having been brushed aside in her age by all her family and friends. \"That's so nice, dear,\" she spoke, placing a hand on my shoulder. \n\n\"You're not fooling me, Robert,\" Iris said from behind me. A chill rose up my spine.  \"I know what you've done, and I've come to put a stop to it.\"\n\nI slowly turned to face Iris.  Her eyes were filled with fiery rage. I'd hoped for so long that she'd been a fabrication of my psyche. The countless hours that she'd pleaded with me to stop had admittedly worn away at me over the years.  We both stared at each other in silent understanding, tears wavering on both our faces as the sounds of police sirens in the distance grew louder.",

Long, wavy red-brown hair cascading over strong but thin shoulders. She wears a dress, simple and black. Hands raised defensively, fingers folded in thought. Full lips, trembling with emotion. Eyes shiny and green, holding back from crying. A girl. A real girl.\n\n\"You found me a long time ago, didn't you?\" I respond.\n\nShe gives me a shaky smile. \"Yeah, but you weren't ready to find me.\"\n\nA tear rolls down her face. I gasp slightly and touch my cheek. It's wet. I am crying too. I can feel my heart racing in my chest. I can hear the gentle words of encouragement my friends have spoken to me over the past months, to coax me into being confident enough to try and find this girl, to reach out to her.\n\nI don't deserve such good friends.\n\nI'm incredibly happy to have them anyway.\n\n\"I... I didn't think you were real,\" I say hesitantly.\n\n\"You're lying,\" she shakes her head, but still smiles, \"lying to yourself. You did think I was real. Other people just made you believe you were deluding yourself.\"\n\n\"Am I not deluding myself?\"\n\n\"How do you feel right now?\"\n\n\"I feel... free. Like a weight's been lifted. Like I can breathe, even though I have trouble breathing right now.\"\n\n\"That's how it is for many the first time.\"\n\nI wipe at my eyes. My smile fades and I shake my head. \"I can't go back, but I have to. I can't show myself like this.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"They will think I'm a freak! They won't recognize me for who I am, they will just impose their own view of me on me, force me to be someone I am not. They won't call me by my name. They won't let me live in safety. Gods, if my family knew--\"\n\n\"What if they did?\"\n\nI freeze in shock. What *if* they did? I stare ahead of me, at her. What if...\n\nIf they knew, would they accept me? I don't know my brothers as well as I could, and my mother has always been a nurturing and kind soul. Would this really change things? My world would be turned upside down, but with my family and my friends supporting me... maybe I could do it?\n\n\"What if they did...\" I mutter to myself.\n\nI feel a spark of warmth in my chest. As I think more about what could be, what I could become, about how life could be better, my confidence begins to rise.\n\n\"Maybe I *will* tell them...\" I say.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Maybe I *will* start this process,\" I say.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I will make things better! I will be who I want myself to be!\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nI let out an elated sigh and can smile again. I reach out with my fingertips and brush against the mirror.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I whisper to her, and see myself smiling back.",

You never stopped Everytime I begged you to. I saw them all. Why would my begging be different to you?\"\n\nMy canvas starts to wimper. I give a quick thought to plunging my knife into her so I can focus on my new found friend. The mistake was, however, giving it any thought at all. My ears still ringing from the first shot, I fail to hear the second as well. I do feel it though. The crimson spot in the middle of my chest is quite exquisite. I always took so much artistic liberty in my work I never gave thought to the simplicity of a single drop of blood, growing inversely proportional to the life it feeds upon. Goodbye old friend. I do wish we could have had more fun together, I think to myself, but not to myself as well.",

The electric red lipstick contrasting her dark lined eyes. The torn pants and old combat boots, were quite unsettling, but she somehow pulled them off. \n\nWith my head slightly tilted to the side, I thought of how safe I felt with her. Even though we were complete strangers, up until 15 seconds ago, she felt like... home. \n\n\"Are you seriously monolauging right now?? God I hate it when you do that. I can still hear you ya know?\"\n\n\"You're real? You're a real person? How is this even possible??\" I stammered as I fully grasped what was happening right in front of me. This phantom voice I've heard for so long now had solidity. She was real. I wasn't crazy. Years of pills and doctors flooded my mind. \"So I'm not crazy? I'm just some weird fucked up... superhero?\"\n\n\"No moron you're not in a comic book.\" She snidely replied. \"I'm you.\" She paused as she looked me up and down. \"An obviously better dressed you.\" \n\nI stared silently, as my thoughts began to race again. The synapses firing rapidly trying to process what was right in front of me. How could this girl, who look like she walked right out of a suicide girls photo, be me? We looked like a weird ass twist to that Taylor Swift song. The one with the music video of the neighbor kids crushing in each other. \n\n\"Christ you're unbelievable. It's you Belong With Me.

Appologies if not)\n\nThere is an existing pair of novels with kinda-sorta this premise.\n\nThey are called *God is Dead* and *Everything Matters* by Ron Currie Jr. \n\nQuick summery:\n\n(For context) In the first book we learn that in the reality the pair is set in God took human form as an ethnic Dinka woman in Sudan and was killed by the Janjaweed. Her body was eaten by wild dogs in the bush. The wild dogs who ate God's body become omniscient but not immortal beings and are all killed by cruel humans trying to exploit them for riches/power. \n\nIn the second book, set a few years after god dies (here's where this prompt comes in) there is this kid who has known since birth that the world will definately end at a specific time on a specific date via an asteroid impact, he assumes he is just crazy. \n\nIn this reality, where the people of the world have now accepted that God is dead, they now worship their children instead of gods. Every person on earth has a cell phone on which they recieve hundreds of messages from a random number of a person they do not know and will never meet. This person worships them and sends them message upon message of adulation, prayres and their deepest secrets, hopes and fears. \n\nEveryone on earth sends these messages to someone. Every person on earth recieves these messages from someone. No one ever reads them.\n\nThis kid reads them. There really is a person on the other end and the world is really going to end via asteroid on the correct date and time he was born knowing.\n\nWithout giving much more of the plot away, everyone on earth must decide wether to leave on ships to colonize space or to stay and die with the earth.\n\nDefinately among my top 10 reads of all time. Incredibly beautiful and elegantly written. 11/10 would reccomend.",

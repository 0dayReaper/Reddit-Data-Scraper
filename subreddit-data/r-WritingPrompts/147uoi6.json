            "comment": "\"So you're the one they call *Old Grimm* are ye?\"\n\nThe reaper nodded.\n\n\"What seems to be the problem lad?\"\n\nThe reaper sighed. \"Every time I take a human soul, I experience a human life. I just saw everything since the moment you could remember things. From your first memory to your last thought at you died.\"\n\n\"Prove it.\"\n\nOld Grimm sighed. \"Your earliest memory is of starring at white paper towels with orange floral outline patterns as they backed up the toilet, because you'd run out of regular TP and liked backing up and plunging the toilet. You know there are things that happened earlier and you even recall events that *must have happened before that!* \n\n\"For example; When you were not quite yet a toddler, you brother would come to talk to you at night when neither of you could sleep, so as to bond with you. You spoke in low volumed voices so as to avoid detection from your mother. He taught about \"the squares of the days\" as you called them in your precociously incompletely formed vocabulary. You learned the days of the week and the week end.\n\n\"One day, you asked him about 'The Big Squares' and took some time to make him understand you meant the calendar pages themselves. He told you there were called months. You told him that your father, who was a sailor, had been gone for two months and asked 'So when will daddy be home? How many monts will it take?' and when your beloved elder brother told you it would be four months, you wept.\n\n\"He grabbed me... Your brother grabbed *you* from the crib and held you as you wept, asking you to \"cry quiet\" so your mom would not awaken and know of you breaking her rules.\n\nOld Grimm smiled. \"When you scooped up that little kid and tossed her to the grass then got slammed by that car, you thought '*An old man dies and a young girl lives? Sounds like a fair trade'* referencing a movie you saw in 2005 before a friendship of your began to deteriorate.\n\n\"Fuuuuuuck. Yeah.\"\n\nOld Grimm smiled. \"And so it is for every mortal. I take on their lives and in so doing, I lose a piece of who I was when I yet lived. I was once a living being you see.\"\n\n\"So... the dead guide the dead into the afterlife?\"\n\nHe chuckled \"Something like that.\"\n\n\"Can I take over for you?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"If this death was gonna last, sure. But it's not. You're already being loaded into an ambulance where you'll be resuscitated en-route to hospital. We have to attend near deaths too, you see. Sadly, you'll likely forget this encounter altogether.\"\n\n\"What if I don't? Can we swap when I *do* die for keeps?\"\n\n\"Not likely. We all have to be stationed near where he chucked it and took someone else's burden. Unless you come back here to die and I'm still on the job, it's unlikely we'll meet again.\"\n\n\"That's a shame. I'm dying of cancer already. It felt cool to think I'd go out a hero instead of suffering in a shit stained set of adult pooping pants in a hospital surrounded by strangers.\"\n\n\"If it's any consolation, the cancer's going to go into remission due to the high level of endorphins and good vibes you'll have from finally proving to yourself that you're not a coward. Additionally, an anonymous angel investor in your area will hear of your deed and donate enough money to the hospital to cover advanced surgery your insurance would never consider paying a single red cent for.\"\n\n\"So I've got more time on the coil de mortal? Cool. Maybe I'll make a trip here someday. Like, once a decade so you have a chance to...\"\n\nOl' Grimm shook his head. \"Naw. If you wanna take over someone's burden... you could climb Mt. Everest in your elderly years. That spot's always staffed by someone who wants out. Last I heard, it was a really decent bloke working there who makes a habit of offering light comfort to people crossing over.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a plan. By the way how does...\"\n\nThere was a painful jolt and I blacked out. Then I woke up in the ICU and saw a doctor digging into my rib cage and blacked out again.\n\nIn the weeks since getting out of St. Marty's I've been reading a lot of books about mountain climbing.",

            "comment": "I met her when I was 19. I was walking into the bookstore on campus. Well, walking was a bit of an overstatement. I was trudging, to be honest, as if I had a million pound weight on my shoulders.\n\nMy mother's cancer had gotten progressively worse and the prognosis is that she'd take her final breath before I took my final exams that semester. With her being that close to her end, my brain had nearly no processing power left to notice the young woman coming out of the door I was trying to go into. We crashed together almost comically, books and bags clattering to the floor.\n\n\"Oh, oh god, I'm so sorry!\" I sputtered out, trying to pick her, me, the books, the bags, and my dignity off of the floor. By the time I had everyone's collective items in my hands, I noticed two things. First, the person I crashed into was the most beautiful woman I'd ever laid my eyes on. Pale, perfect skin. The deepest blue eyes. Long, black hair that she was currently pushing out of her face.\n\nThe second thing was, that woman had (prior to our introduction) been eating a pastry from the bookstore cafe which was now planted firmly in the center of her chest. A mass of cream cheese and flaky crust nestled in a most delicate place. I looked down at the pastry. She looked down at the pastry. I looked back up at her. She looked back up at me. And she burst out laughing. A bright, resonant chime of a laugh that made her entire countenance light up like summer. And I fell in love instantly.\n\nAn hour later, we were sitting outside that cafe at the tables in the courtyard. A pile of crumpled, cream cheese-coated paper towels and a cup of water from the coffee stand were the remnants of the cleanup attempt. In that hour, I learned her name was Kat. I learned that she was a history major. I learned that she had a part-time job and she liked to travel and she didn't have any pets, not because she was allergic but because she didn't have time, but she did like dogs and one day she'd like to have three of them.\n\nI also learned that being with her lessened the burden on my shoulders, at least for 3,600 seconds that were as beautiful a respite as she was.\n\n===\n\nThe wail of the ambulance siren is almost deafening. I step out of the way of the EMTs as they rush past with a gurney. What is the emergency? If this is a memory, I can't remember it. Why am I standing in the road, anyway? Can't remember that, either.\n\n===\n\nA day later, we had our first real date. A week later, we had our first kiss. A month later, I crumpled into a wailing mess in her arms as the million pound weight finally crashed atop me, the sound of my father on the phone that had clattered to the floor of my dorm room weeping gently and not trying to call me back to the line. \"I'm here and won't leave your side,\" she whispered into my ear, and held me as the universe collapsed around me.\n\nHer funeral was on one of those days where you finally notice that the leaves were beginning to lose their autumn saturation and more and more of them were lying in clusters on the grass, drying to dust where the wind left them after whatever short journey they took. She held my hand as I sobbed, watching her casket slowly take her farther away from me than I had the power to go.\n\n===\n\nIt's clear there has been some kind of car crash. Or an accident on the road at least. A crowd is forming on the sidewalks on either side, phones out to form a macabre memory of this moment that no one would ever want to watch. I can see the car, but it doesn't seem like there is another. Wait. There it is, it's not another car. It's a bike, crumpled under the front bumper.\n\n===\n\nOur wedding was on one of those days where you finally notice that the trees are green, even though they haven't been green in as long as you can remember. The sun shone down on her pale skin, framed in a white veil traced in lace flowers. Tulips, maybe? Or violets? Given that I proposed to her in a field of wild violets, that seemed likely. I'll admit, I couldn't really see the intricate detail through the mist in my eyes. We stood hand-in-hand in the church whose yard held a headstone with a fresh bouquet of flowers that matched the ones with which she walked down the aisle. It was her idea and it was beautiful.\n\nOur vows were personal. Mine made her laugh, especially when I promised her as many cheese danish as she could ever want. Hers made me cry, especially when she promised, \"I'm here and I won't leave your side.\" I placed a band of silver and sapphire on her finger.\n\nAnd she didn't. The next many years we built a life together. No children, but a house full of love and laughter. Three dogs, and what a handful they were. Love in abundance, filling our days, side by side.\n\n===\n\nI know that bike. I walk over to where the EMTs surround a body lying on the ground. One is performing CPR while the other is trying to staunch a wound. The leg isn't lying right and a bone is sticking out of a place a bone is not supposed to be, causing blood to pool behind the body. I don't know that bone, specifically, but I know who it belongs do. It belongs to a man who insists on biking in this city where people seem to crash into each other, distracted by the weight of the world.\n\nI see a figure standing next to the EMTs and next to the man. Pale skin underneath a black hood. Or is that a hood of black hair? Piercing blue eyes, deep as eternity. If I could see her hands beneath the sleeves of the black robe she wore, I'd know the color of the stone in the band on her left hand.\n\nI look down at him. She looks down at him. I look up from me. She looks up at me. \"Why are you here?\" I ask in a distant voice.\n\n\"I'm not sure how much longer I can keep doing this,\" she says in a voice that echoes in my ear.\n\n\"Doing what?\" I say, my lips not moving but the sound coming anyway.\n\n\"Holding you here. I wanted to give you as many seconds as I could. The moment you hit the ground, I was supposed to call your name and that was supposed to be that.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I say. It is a short sound. Kind of an underwhelming response to the scene unfolding in front of me. \"Why are you her?\"\n\n\"It's hard to say. I'm not really her, but I am. She's not really here but she is. And because she is, I'm doing what I should not. Love is a peculiar thing, while it lives. And even for a little while afterwards.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" This time, there is a period at the end of my utterance. I know now what I know and I know the finality of it. I know there will be a call and a phone clattering to the floor and a million pounds that didn't exist one second before crashing down.\n\n\"We need to go. It's time for me to call your name.\" Her voice is soft and light and I imagine if I could make her laugh, it would be bright and resonant and illuminating like the summer sun.\n\n\"Can I say goodbye?\"\n\n===\n\nI see her standing over the sink, rinsing potatoes she peeled for dinner. I see her standing outside the window, waiting patiently to call my name. I walk up to her and place my hands around her waist. She smiles, a memory coming to her mind of the feeling of my hands around her waist. And I lean down next to her ear and I whisper, \"I'm here and I won't leave your side.\"\n\nShe closes her eyes.\n\nThe phone rings.\n\nShe calls my name.",

            "comment": "The man turned to look at the figure, his lip curled in a sly smirk.\n\n\"What, a couple thousand years shouldn't hurt someone like you!\" Joseph peered down at the the bruises tattooed across his twisted corpse's chest. \"Besides, I think you did a great job. Well...\" he shrugged, \"barring the driver.\" Death watched as Joseph turned to the smoking car across from them, the blood-soaked glass from the broken windshield dotting the tree.\n\nIt turns out that drunk drivers really DO like Fridays.\n\n\"I... don't think you understand the gravity of the situation,\" Death stammered. \"My job, my... y-you're not supposed to still be here. It's been four thousand years since we made that deal and I'm starting to--\"\n\n\"--Get cold feet?\" Joseph interrupted. \"What's that big guy gonna do? Take your robes and leave you homeless?\" The man stifled a chuckle. \"Is he gonna take your scythe away and leave you without your 401k?\"\n\nDeath let out a small sigh. \"Probably, but more importantly, I'm worried about YOU.\"\n\n\"Me?\" Joseph smirked. \"Ain't got nothin' to worry about! The big guy don't know!\"\n\nDeath's voice suddenly turned into a hushed whisper. \"That's the point! I'm worried he's gonna find out! You're lucky he can't see you in the limbo, because if he did, his tally is gonna be off and he's gonna kick my ass for it! And stars forbid what he's gonna do if he gets his hands on you!\" Death poked Joseph in the chest.\n\nJoseph couldn't wipe that smirk off his face even if he tried. \"What's he gonna do? Send me to Hell?\"\n\nThe black-hooded figure leaned in close, his desperate voice barely heard. \"No, he's gonna do something REAL bad, like it's reserved for the worst of the worst of souls!\" He suddenly shivered. \"I think the last time he did it, it may or may not have caused the ten plagues of Egypt...\"\n\nThe man's mind traveled back to the last hundred years of Bible study for a brief moment before snapping back to the present. \"Ah, it ain't gonna happen. Besides, I can just come back all fine and dandy!\" Joseph pointed to his corpse. \"Aside from a few broken bones....\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" Death growled. \"That's just it, you dumbass! If I lose my job, you won't be able to come back!\"\n\nJoseph felt the colour drain from his face and for a moment, the corners of his sly smile twitched. He swallowed. \"Do what?\" All those years of getting impaled by Roman soldiers, beheaded by Robespierre and festering plague boils crawled up his skin.\n\nIf Death lost his job, he couldn't come back. There'd be nothing.\n\nHe'd just have to face the \"big guy\" and then he'd...\n\nJoseph's lips clamped shut at the mere thought of what would've happened next.\n\nNo, now wasn't the time to panic. Not yet at least.\n\n\"Maybe we can try to keep this going for a little bit longer?\" Joseph tried to force a trembling smile. Death glanced at the sickle in his thin, bony hand. After a long pause, he finally sighed.\n\n\"Fine, but if the big guy finds out about this,\" the tip of the blade touched Joseph's throat, \"I'm not gonna be able to bring you back, and whatever he does to you, I ain't gonna be able to bail you out. And--\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, I get it, sheesh!\" Joseph rolled his eyes. \"You're not gonna be able to bring me back, I get it. Don't gotta rub it in, okay?\" The man glared at the sickle poking his neck. He didn't want to think about what would happen after all of that, though. It was too existential.",

What about him?\"\n\n\"I have his address\"\n\nLooking at Michael I start to wonder how we ever become friends, he's like a walking red flag. The dude only called us some names(something about Michaels powers) then left, I assumed that was the end of it but I suppose it's not. The insalts weren't even good, just same old generic names. Michael looks at me with a glint in his eye, pulling me away from my body and towards the front door.\n\n\"What do you say we give him a good scare?\"\n\nSuddenly I remember why we became friends.\n( Fin, I went with a more happy story because I thought this promt would be good with this story.:))",

He must have inadvertently hurled some of his husk's intestines in his valet's direction while tearing himself free of it. \r  \n\r  \n \"Sorry about that, Withers.\" Simon managed to choke out, though his throat was still forming.\r  \n\r  \n\"I...\" the valet began, then sputtered, as a scrap of what had once been Simon slid further down his face, almost touching his lips. He dropped the umbrella and fished in one of the raincoat's deep pockets for a blue disposable towel, which he used to wipe his face thoroughly.\r  \n\r  \nThat accomplished, Withers paused to collect himself, and take several deep breaths before continuing.\r  \n\r  \n\"Sir, I...I'm not sure how much longer I can keep doing this,\" Withers said.\n\n\"Surely not,\" Simon rasped, \"Your performance thus far has been exemPLAAAHGHGHHGGHHHHH\" Simon's voice was cut off in a gurgling scream, as his back arched, broke, and then lengthened by more than a foot. \n\n\"--Exemplary,\" Simon continued, his voice much clearer, as he shook out his slowly growing arms. \"You understand the duties of a valet, and see to them all most diligently -- that's quite rare, these days.\"\n\n\"Thank you sir,\" Withers said, uncertainly. \"But it's not the...*customary* duties that I'm finding myself ill-suited for.\"\n\n\"What, you mean...all this?\" Simon asked, gesturing to the husk. His old body lay splayed on ground beside him, eyes staring blankly, its mouth open unnaturally wide -- though not nearly so wide as its burst ribcage and abdomen, from whence Simon had wriggled out moments before.\n\n\"Yes sir, all of...that.\" Wither confirmed, nodding vigorously. The valet held up his hands, as if to forestall objections. \"I do not doubt your assurances that given your, er, special circumstances, periodically dismembering and disposing of your body is neither immoral, nor even technically illegal. But while I am intellectually satisfied with that conclusion, I am...one might say, emotionally...\"\n\n\"Viscerally?\" Simon suggested.  \n\nWithers winced. \"I'd prefer you not use that particular terminology just now, sir.\"\n\nSimon glanced at the ruin of of his husk. \"Ah! Of course. But in any case, I'd really hate to see you go.\"\n\n\"Yes, well...\" Withers began, then swallowed hard. \"I may need to resign in any case, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Simon said, frowning. \"Well, I guess I'll have to eat you, then.\"\n\n\"S-sir?\" Withers said, his face paling.\n\n\"That was a joke, Withers.\" Simon said, waving a hand dismissively as his fingers finished growing to roughly adult size. \"But listen, you've already done this twice now. It will only get easier from here.\"\n\n\"I don't think--\"\n\n\"Especially since you're a due a pay rise.\" Simon added, casually.\n\n\"Sir, it's not really a question of mo--\"\n\n\"A 50% pay rise.\" Simon said.\n\nWithers paused. He looked from his still-misshapen employer to the inert pile of mutilated meat and bone that had employed him previously. The valet cleared his throat.\n\n\"Well. I'll just get the chainsaw then, sir.\" he said, crisply, walking around to the back of the ATV. \n\n\"Good man!\" Simon said cheerfully. He manually jerked his right thumb into proper alignment with its socket, and then extended it upward approvingly.",

There is no way to end my suffering.\"\n\n\"What do people normally have to do? To cross over?\" I asked.\n\n\"They need to forgive themselves. For everything they've done. For everything they didn't.\"\n\n\"Have you ever forgiven yourself? For anything that's happened? For your relationship with Cain? For how you left your family?\"\n\n\"No. I could never forgive Cain for what he did.\" Abel replied, angry at the thought of forgiving his brother.\n\n\"Good, 'cause it's not him you need to forgive. It's yourself.\"\n\nAbel thought for a moment. He removed the hood from his head. The wound was healing.\n\n\"I suppose it was partially my fault we fought all the time. And I did pick a few of the fights. We had everything, but we always had to have what the other had.\" \n\nThe wound on his head had disappeared. Behind him, large, golden gates appeared, shimmering with a pearly glow. Abel turned around and fell to his knees.\n\n\"I never thought they'd open for me,\" he said, tears falling from his face. I walked up to him and put his arm on his shoulder.\n\n\"Everyone's waiting for you. Everyone you've helped. Everyone you've guided throughout the millenia. Go. It's you time.\"\n\nHe looked up towards me, with a smile larger than any I could muster. Behind us, a voice rang throughout the area. A voice familiar to Abel.\n\n\"Yo, what the fu-\"",

            "comment": "Shouts. Yelling. Followed by hushed voices and receding footsteps. And then a hollow thud. He wasn't sure what had all happened, but when he opened his eyes the world was not right. After blinking for several slow moments, his vision adjusted. Shadows came first. Then shapes. And lastly followed fully formed images.\n\nHe stood in an alley tucked away from the busy life of the city. Sounds could be heard, faraway and distant. His hands were nestled in his pockets and when he looked down, he noticed a slumped body against the bricks. Why can I see myself? Odd, how he knew that the body was his own. Stranger, even, that he was so calm about it. And like a whisper by someone else, realization washed over him: I'm dead.\n\nHe wasn't sure where he was but it was dark and isolated. As if an afterthought, he noticed the blood pooling around his body but wasn't sure where it was coming from. He regarded himself as a scientist for their latest project. His curiosity was more intense than his would-be fear. He had far more questions than he did answers.\n\nHe was momentarily startled when he felt the air next to him shift. As he looked over, he noticed a hooded form. He couldn't make out what was beneath it but noticed the intricate design of the robe. The elegant scythe that was held on his back. Even the unique metal torch that rested at his side, overturned and devoid of life.\n\n\"I am not sure how much longer I can keep doing this,\" the robed figure said in a choked sob.\n\nHe blinked and turned towards the figure next to him. A sense of knowing was there, but aside from that he couldn't tell whom the other was. Everything was unclear. Fuzzy, like an old TV that had a poor connection to the satellite and the picture would only come in through static.\n\n\"Neither do I,\" he replied as if he knew what the other was talking about. It seemed that at that moment, the figure needed reassurance. \"But we do it because we have to.\"\n\nWith a deep sigh, the hood of the black robe fell back, revealing what appeared to be a young man around his own age. Though, to be fair, he didn't know what age that was. The figure's eyes were red and puffy, as if he'd been silently crying for a while, and as he rubbed at them one more time he let out a choked laugh.\n\n\"I wish there were another way,\" he said with a sad smile. \"We do this all the time.\"\n\nYet, despite not knowing exactly what the other meant, the man has no desire to inquire. Odd, how he knew that. It was like a voice, possibly his own, was telling him not to ask.\n\n\"We've met before,\" he said as if it was the one thing he had ever been sure of. He couldn't even remember his own name but he knew, without a doubt, that this handsome man and himself were well acquainted.\n\n\"Far too often, I am afraid,\" he shook his head as he averted his eyes to the slumped form on the ground in front of them. His face had grief, loss, and longing written all over it. The man felt something pull inside of him, a feeling so distant he couldn't even remember the name for. Compelled, he walked towards his body and placed a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Explain.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath, the robed man paused for a moment before he released a long exhale.\n\n\"I am here to guide your soul from the mortal realm to the Underworld. In your pocket, you will find an obol to pay Charon. He will ferry you across the Styx to Hades. There, it will be decided where you will rest. Your actions in life will determine whether you will enter Elysium, roam the Asphodel Meadows, or perhaps endure the endless tortures of Tartaras. \"\n\nThe words seemed so rehearsed and the man turned his head back to look at the other.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he said as confusion laced his words. \"If we've met before, why are you taking me there?\"\n\nThe robed man sighed and ran a hand through his silvery hair, \"because of me.\"\n\nIt was followed by a silence that had no answers and all the answers at once. The other man looked into his deep blue eyes, searching for something to all the questions he had yet to ask. In them, he noticed an emotion he couldn't place earlier: guilt.\n\n\"Love is a funny emotion. How it creeps up on you and fully consumes you. How even in death, it refuses to let you go, truly,\" he said as he refused to break eye contact.\n\n\"I don't blame you, Thanatos,\" the man replied as he moved to place a hand over the god's own. Cold.\n\nHe watched as the mere utterance of the god's name helped to release some of the guilt held in his eyes. He noticed a spark of something flare in their depths, only to be quickly quenched. Sadness once again filling the sapphire pools.\n\n\"I broke the rules. I would do anything, anything, for you,\" Thanatos whispered so forcefully that all the man could hear was his voice. \"I begged. Pleaded. Anything to spare you.\" Another pause, this time followed by the god wrapping his hands around the man's. Despite his cool touch, the man felt his hands were on fire.\n\n\"'Your insolence will not be forgotten. You will never hold him in your arms again, for as long as you shepherd the souls. You will be forced to watch him live a life without you a thousand times over. Do not covet the dead which do not belong to you.'\"\n\nThe words of warning were familiar. A part of the man wanted to ask how much longer they had to fulfill, but he knew the answer wasn't soon. The amount of sadness lingering in Thanatos' eyes was proof of that. He was still mourning the loss of his love.\n\nWithout thought, the man moved forward and wrapped his arms tightly around the god. It was only a short moment of Thanatos awkwardly standing there before he returned the embrace, burying his face into the other's neck. He took deep breaths as if he was savoring the moment. The man wasn't sure, but he assumed it had been quite a while since they had last hugged like that.\n\nTurning his head, the god muttered into the man's ear, \"sweet grapes and cucumbers.\" It was so full of love and gentleness that a soft smile spread across his face at the sound of other's caring voice.\n\nSlowly, and rather reluctantly, Thanatos peeled himself away from the man who seemed to grip the god's robes tighter as if not to be pulled away. The desire to remain in the warm and loving embrace was more important to him than anything else. Thanatos laughed a deep, rumbling sound. Calming and reassuring.\n\n\"My dearest heart, I love you. Only you. I will be here, waiting,\" Thanatos said as he leaned forward to place a gentle kiss on the man's forehead. The area where his lips touched his skin was tinkling and his whole body felt alight.\n\n\"Is there anything I can do?\"\n\n\"No, I am afraid not. The Fates have already decided. I must endure this alone.\"\n\n\"Well,\" the man said with a deep breath. \"I won't forget you.\"\n\n\"Nor I you, heart. I will continue to be here, each and every time. We will meet again in twenty-five years time,\" Thanatos gripped his hands tightly. \"And I will love you just as I always have. And more. Do you have any questions before\u2026?\" He trailed off waiting for the man to think of anything.\n\n\"What was my name?\"\n\nA bright smile spread across Thanatos' face and for the first time, the guilt in his eyes seemed to be overcome by the sheer amount of love he held for him. It seemed like this was a question he never tired of. And as if the sweets melody he had ever heard, the god replied softly,\n\n\"Thaddeus.\"",

            "comment": "umm tw for self homicide\n\nI don\u2019t remember much about my life. My name is Indy, or at least my nickname is. Looking at my body, I can guess I\u2019m about 16, but it\u2019s hard to tell by the grayish skin that holds no more blood. \n\n\u201cIndiana,\u201d a soft voice says from behind me, \u201cYou are dead.\u201d\n\nA hand lands on my shoulder. It\u2019s bony, but warmth washes over me. Where confusion and helplessness once were is filled with relief and comfort. It\u2019s a strange thing to feel as I watch blood deep out of me, but it feels right. \n\n\u201cYou may feel lost, but that will soon change. I am a grim reaper. You can ask me anything, for Reapers hold infinite wisdom.\u201d\n\nMy throat feels dry. I should have dozens of questions, but only one repeats itself in my head. \n\n\u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. \n\nI feel the bony hands cover my eyes, and the Reaper and I are teleported into my life. \n\nI\u2019m a newborn, still in the hospital. My mother is beautiful, even after labor. Her blonde hair is tied up in a messy, floppy bun, and sweat is dripping down her face, but her dark brown eyes and huge smile seem to distract everyone from that. She laughs as she brushes my nose with her finger, which fills the room with something just short of music. \n\nThe scene changes. I\u2019m sitting at a table in a park. My short blonde hair looks almost like a nest, but I had managed to cover it up with a paper party hat. Chocolate is smeared around my face, probably from the slice of cake in front of me. A balloon in the shape of a 6 floats behind me, and I pose for a picture for my mom. \n\nAgain, the scene changes. I\u2019m sitting in a school cafeteria, surrounded by other kids. I can\u2019t hear what I\u2019m saying, but I see the kids around me smile and laugh, entranced by whatever story I\u2019m telling. I can\u2019t help but to smile as I watch my younger self. \n\nMy view morphs into a party. It\u2019s clear that I\u2019m in high school now, just from my skimpy skirt and the pound of makeup on my face. I\u2019m talking to a boy, taking the occasional sip from my red cup. A few girls walk up to us, and I instantly stop talking. The girl in front of the group throws her drink on my tight white top. Everyone, including her goons and the boy, laughs. I watch myself run out of the house, where two more girls are waiting in the backyard to push me into the pool. \n\nI\u2019m humiliated. \n\nI can hardly watch as the scene changes again. The girl I saw laying lifeless on the floor is now sitting on the edge of a bathtub. A box cutter slices through her skin with ease. From the scars on her wrists, I know this isn\u2019t a new occurrence. Tears fall down her face as she cuts, and she shakes the extra blood into the tub. I don\u2019t know if she meant to cut as deep as she did, but panic fills her eyes as she loses balance and falls onto the floor. She doesn\u2019t move anymore. \n\nI turn away from the limp, still-warm body that used to be mine. The black hooded figure beside me breaks into tears. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much longer I can keep doing this,\u201d they say. \n\n\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d I ask, sitting on the floor next to my body. \n\n\u201c300 years,\u201d they say, collapsing next to me. \u201c300 years I\u2019ve been doing this. I have never been assigned a suicide until this year. In the past week, I\u2019ve had 10.\u201d\n\nI reach for their hand, holding it gently in mine. i now understand the job of the Reapers. \n\nNow it\u2019s my turn to comfort them.",

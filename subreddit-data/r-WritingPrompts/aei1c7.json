            "comment": "A lightning storm manifested from seemingly nowhere as Jack got out of his car and loomed over the crushed and broken man he'd just slammed into. \n\nA bolt of lightning struck nearby. Then another, and another. The overwhelming smell of ozone filled the air. Finally, the largest lightning bolt yet slammed down from the heaven's and struck Jack. Power surged through him, as the lights of his car exploded, his phone flew from his hand and blew up, and the nearby electrical wires began to rain down sparks before snapping in two and swinging down to the forest below. \n\nOvercome by sheer power, a voice as if God himself, spoke in Jack's head.\n\n&gt; THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES\n\nThe lightning died down, Jack fell to the ground covered in sweat, hands on the warm asphalt, the dead man laying beside him and, suddenly, Jack knew how to install a gray water system in a late 19th century Victorian house. Or change the drainage catch on a split level. For months there had been a leak in the toilet on the second floor of Jack's mother in law's house, and now, sitting there on the highway, Jack knew that the problem was a simple gasket that had worn down and that he could fix it for under a dollar. \n\n\"Holy shit,\" Jack said to the empty street and the dead man and himself, \"I'm a plumber!\" \n\nJack needed to be sure. He scrambled over to the contorted dead man and began rummaging through his blood-stained pockets until he found a wallet, which he flung open and searched for an ID. There was a driver's license and on it a name. Jack Wallace. \n\n\"See you Jack,\" Jack said, and then took out his list and crossed off another name. There was only one Jack left in this zipcode.\n\nJack got back in his car and drove over to the last address. \n\nHe arrived as the sun was coming up, his small pistol hidden away in the inside pocket of his jacket. It was a small, one-story house. As he circled the home, casing it, Jack noted that the drainage pipe in the backyard was three meters short of regulation. He also saw that one of the back windows was wide open. It had been a hot night and there was not a lot of crime in these parts. \n\nSo Jack walked right up to the house and climbed inside. \n\nOnce in the home Jack pulled his pistol and wiped beading sweat off his forehead. He realized he was very tired - how many hours ago had he killed Jack Wallace on the highway and taken his knowledge? When had he last slept? \n\nBut nevermind all that, it was only the hunt that mattered. If he was right, this Jack, Jack Warner, was an auto mechanic, which would be a much-needed skill given the amount of time Jack spent on the road, hunting and killing other Jacks. \n\nJack stalked through the hallway of Jack Warner's small home, opening doors slowly, pistol up and ready. He walked through the thin house, opening each door until at last, he came to a final room. It had to be the bedroom. Eager, tired, Jack turned the doorknob and gave the door a push. \n\nJack heard the click before he saw the shotgun suspended from the ceiling. Then came the deafening blast of the shotgun's discharge and the buckshot took Jack hard in the chest. \n\nEyes wide, back flat on the carpeted floor, Jack could feel his lungs filling up with blood. He struggled to get up, but could not get his feet under him. Someone walked out of the bedroom and kicked the small pistol out of Jacks limp hand, and stood over Jack, looking down at him appraisingly.\n\n\"Bagged me another one, I guess.\" Without any regard for Jack's desperate writhing and gurgling, Jack Warner bent down and began rummaging through Jack's pockets. He found Jack's wallet, opened it up, looked at the driver's license, and clicked his tongue against his front teeth. \"Yep.\" Then he gave Jack a disappointed look and shook his head at him. \"Thought you could sneak up on me unawares, huh? Big mistake, and not the first time neither.\" \n\nJack's mouth was opening and closing like a dying fish as he tried to say something with his last breath. He could taste hot iron on his tongue.\n\nJack Warner saw Jack was trying to say something, and so he bent down low and placed his ear to Jack's mouth.\n\nWetly, Jack managed the words, his bloody hand reaching up and holding on to Jack Warner's shoulder for dear life.\n\n\"There. . . can. . .be . . . only. . .one... \"\n\nJack's hand went limp, the light left his eyes, and he passed right there on Jack Warner's carpet. \n\nJack Warner for his part, nodded solemnly. \"Don't I know it, brother.\" \n\nThen he ran out into the back yard as quick as he could so that the lightning wouldn't start a fire in his house. He made it just in time, as a lightning storm coalesced above him. Bolts of blue electricity struck the ground in several places first, and then hit Jack right on the head, coursing pure energy through his veins. A voice, as of God, said to him:\n\n&gt;THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES.\n\nAnd then the storm was gone, and Jack fell to the ground. In the aftermath, he took a deep breath of the hot summer air and reveled in his new found knowledge. Slowly, he got up to his feet and started back inside to take care of the body.\n\nAs he walked in through the back door, Jack's gaze fell on the drainage pipe leading from the back of his house. He realized, for the first time ever, that it was three meters under regulation. \n\n\"I'll be damned,\" he said, smiling to himself, \"I'm a goddamned plumber.\" \n\n************\n\n#### For More Legends From The Multiverse\n\n## r/LFTM\n\n\n\n\n\n",

That isn't to say I completely disregard them - I think it's fairly straight forward, looking at this story, that it wasn't a *complete* disregard of the prompt, for instance - but I do treat the prompt as *inspiration* for whatever story occurs to me - which sometimes results in a story that isn't, perhaps, precisely in line with the prompter's initial intentions. \n\nPersonally, I enjoy the freedom to be able to do that, especially as I respond to a great many prompts, but I understand it can sometimes be frustrating to have the prompt point one way and have a story take a somewhat different approach. \n\nThanks for reading though, and for expressing your opinion in a cordial way! This is a great community and kind of an incredible safe space, and comments like this make me glad to be a part of it. God knows folks elsewhere on the internet, elsewhere on Reddit for that matter, can be far less civil.",

The strange message really threw him off his comfort.\n\n\"Ok now, where is the hidden camera? Which game show am I on?\"\n\n*You are not in a game show. You are the 12th participant in the JackJack Experiment. You have 48 hours to identify and terminate at least one other Jack.*\n\n\"So I'm either in a great show or I'm having the best trip of my life. Still, I'm glad I haven't killed anyone. HEY! Whatever you are, what if I don't want 'kill' any more Jacks?\"\n\n*You are the 12th participant in this experiment. Statistically speaking your species should contain enough intelligent individuals to realize what this means.*\n\n\"You've got to be kidding\" He started to panic \"How dense you have to be to force people to murder each other for nothing?!?\"\n\n*It is not for nothing; you now have everything you need to know about his trade. 1017kg/m3 converted. Why is this information relevant to your task?*\n\n\"That's not what I meant.... Well whatever it was fun, I'll watch this and laugh at myself on the web. See ya around.\"\n\n*You are not permitted to leave*\n\n\"You dense fucker, you said 48 hours. At least count them all.\"\n\n*Failing your task will result in your termination in a specific way your predecessors called 'cruel and painful'*\n\n\"Well then, what if I kill myself? Then you cannot force me to do anything and I won't be in pain.\"\n\nThe world shifted, suddenly he was in space watching the globe revolve. The lights of the dark globe were shining. It truly would have been beautiful sight, but he was truly in space. The air rushed out of his lungs creating severe pain, he felt immense cold and heat at the same time. He lost his vision shortly after he was somehow teleported. Jack couldn't decide what was worse; the suffocation or the cold boiling of his own blood. Before everything went dark, he thought to himself:\n\n\"I will do it!\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHe woke up in his truck in a parking lot next to a gas station. He still had headache and a weird dream.\n\n\"Whatever booze I drunk last night, I'll probably never do it again.\"\n\n*It was not a dream, Jack. You have 37 hours and 11 minutes left of your assignment*\n\n\"Ah come on now! It is impossible to find another Jack within this time frame.\"\n\nThere was no answer for quite a while\n\n\"Fuck you then.\" He was also very hungry so decided to pick up a Hot Dog inside the gas station.\" Inside the station was empty, only a sleepy clerk was at the cash register. Without him looking at Jack, as if automated, the clerk said:\n\n\"Welcome to the Fill-It-Up station sir.\"\n\n\"I'd like two Hot Dogs with all sauces.\" Without bothering to answer, the clerk went to the wiener roller machine and started to prepare them. Welder, and now also Plumber Jack roamed the store to find any magazines where maybe someone offered gay sex. Who knew, maybe he could call them and ask for their names, then kill them. It was a poor idea but he didn't have any better ones.\n\n\"Your Hot Dogs are ready, sir.\" Jack brought the gay magazine to the register with a ton of embarrassment. When he got the Hot Dogs, he glanced at the name plate of the clerk: Jack. Holly fucking fuck, he thought as he went out to his truck. He wasn't hungry anymore, so he packed the food into the trunk, then he just sat there. Finally, a lousy idea came. He popped open the hood to disconnect the battery, then went back to the building.\n\n\"Excuse me, could you please help me with my car? It won't start....\"\n\n\"I am sorry; I can't help you.\"\n\n\"Please, I really need to get going. Would you help me for hundred bucks?\" The clerk looked at the cameras, then reached for under the counter. After he turned off the cameras, he went outside with Jack. Jack opened the hood for the clerk to look inside. Right when the clerk leaned inside, Jack grabbed the hood and pulled down as fast as he could. There was a wet snap, a disgusting sound then a message finally appeared:\n\n*You successfully killed another Jack within the given time-frame. Your new unlocked skill is: Infinite patience.*\n\n\"That's ok.\"\n\n*Your timer for the next assignment refreshed. You have 48 hours to identify and terminate at least one other Jack.*\n\n\"All right. I would like to ask you something....\"\n\n*Granted*\n\n\"More like a proposal. You either give me more time search and destroy or you help me find new ones. I don't care what you choose, just choose one.\"\n\n*We will help you identify the next one.*\n\n\"Cool. Where is he and what skill does he have?\"\n\n*He is inside a small gym few miles down the road. His skill is close quarters combat.*",

Somebody has been killing us off!\u201d Herwitz yelled, scrutinizing the table full of Jacks.\n\nThe aptly named \u201cMeeting of all Jacks\u201d had become a weekly affair as the number of Jacks killed had risen sharply over the last couple of months. On the wide wall behind Jack Herwitz, there was a projection of a couple colored graphs where you could see Jack\u2019s killed over time.\n\nJack Baptista tried wiping out some sot in his gray plumber overall, \u201cYeah! We Jacks need to stick together!\u201d \n\nAll other Jacks around the table gave their two cents, \u201cYeah!\u201d, \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d they said. \n\nJack Calzoni embedded his axe in the table, muscles rippling beneath the red and black checkered shirt, \u201cI say we find him, and kill him!\u201d\n\nVehement agreement passed around the table.\n\n\u201cBut how do we find him?\u201d Jack Dacosta, wearing a clean white shirt and a blue tie, said. \n\nJack Herwitz pondered the question for a few moments, \u201cWe need to lay a trap,\u201d he began, \u201cone of us needs to bait him, draw him out!\u201d\n\nBaptista held up and arm, \u201cI\u2019ll do it, I volunteer, let\u2019s catch this mongrel!\u201d\n\nThe room full of Jacks quickly began sketching up a primary plan on a white-board to catch their killer, and before long they had something actionable. Blue lines showed a badly drawn Jack Baptista standing next to a car surrounded by smoke, having car trouble, and looking at the engine. Crude bushes in the background depicted the rest of the Jacks in hiding. The final panel showed them all stomping on their ominous killer, together.\n\nAfter agreeing to set the trap in the morning, they proceeded to talk casually for a bit before saying their farewells and their \u201csee you tomorrow\u2019s\u201d\n\nJack Baptista was the last person in the room together with Jack Herwitz, \u201cSee you tomorrow then, Herwitz! We\u2019ll catch him, no doubt!\u201d\n\nJack Herwitz smiled and nodded, \u201cRight you are! Just one thing, do you have a moment? I want to ask you something about the plan. Don\u2019t want to send you in unprepared after all!\u201d Herwitz chuckled.\n\nBaptista walked next to Herwitz, standing close to the white-board \u201cSure, what do you need?\u201d\n\nWithout warning, Herwitz stabbed Baptista in the throat with a hidden blade.\n\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d Baptista gurgled, words barely distinguishable.\n\n\u201cThere can only be one Jack of all trades, Jack!\u201d Herwitz gleefully exclaimed, absorbing another trade into his internal repository.\n*****\nThank you for reading!\n\n### [/r/NordicNarrator](https://www.reddit.com/r/NordicNarrator)",

            "comment": "Jack immediately reacts. \n\nJack of all trades? Isn't that an old adage?\n\nJack keeps driving, too his client, thinking about what he had done. It's over an hour drive, so Jack thought of how he could gain more skills. Welding and plumbing... maybe architecture? Masonry? He wrote acting he could think of in the notes on his phone. \n\nAfter getting done with his client's weird weld of two bikes for art, he noticed something. The man, also named Jack, was an artist, but he had handmade pottery all around his house. \n\nThis is my chance, Jack thought. \n\nHe picked up a pot and smashed it on the man's head. Pottery. That can be useful. \n\nFor the next few weeks, Jack went around just like that. Finding other Jacks that had skills he could use. He could feel the power rush through him, making him more energized and ready for the next Jack.\n\nUntil he met Jacqueline. \n\nAt first, Jack had gone to her apartment to help fix a leak, with all his brand new equipment he had \"borrowed\" from other Jacks. Jacqueline was cooking something that smelled delicious, like a good stirfry. She was short, couldn't be older than her late 20's. Jack thought to himself that she was fun to talk to while he worked, and it slowed him down a bit and allowed him to relax. \n\nThen she came at him with a frying pan.\n\nIt was hot when he was hit the first few times, she tried bashing his skull in. He kept blocking it with his arm, burning it as hot cooking oil flew everywhere.\n\nThen he put two and two together. Jacqueline was also trying to become a Jack of all trades. He kept yelling \"Stop! Stop!\" Until she finally did, exhausted from swinging. He explained to her that he's not only a plumber. He's been trying to become the same thing, gain the same power. He had eliminated probably close to a hundred Jacks, all to gain strength. He wanted to be the one. \n\nJacqueline explained that she had killed the same, and that she didn't want to perish to another Jack. When she saw Jack's fliers for housework, she knew she could get an extra skill for plumbing. \n\nThey talked to each other and compared all their skills. None were the same. \n\nJack and Jacqueline fell in love, got married, and continued on their quest to eliminate all the Jacks, for years. The pair had gotten really good at it too; finding a Jack online or in the phonebook, offering to do major house renovations, dog breeding, financial assistance, and anything else they had acquired all for a very low price. Who wouldn't want that? \n\nFor years, they gained so many powers, not even questioning what it was before they took it. \n\nAfter a while, they started having a hard time tracking down Jacks. It even became a daily struggle to find other work elsewhere to pay for all the traveling they did.\n\nAfter a while, a book store owner contacted them by mail. His name was Jack.\n\nThey eagerly went to visit the bookkeeper, only to find an old man who had obviously seen enough to be wiser than the duo, before he broke the silence and told them he knew what they were up to. They had been killing thousands of Jacks a year that it could be felt by any other Jack still alive. He told them he was very smart, and used his wit and knowledge to teach other Jacks to become multi-purpose without killing each other. He was successful, until this pair tracked down every last one of his students and killed them. He was the last one. \n\nImmediately and instinctively, the couple attacked him. He swiftly moved out of each of their notes, even dodging books thrown at him. The entire time, he looked so disappointed, it caught Jack and Jaqueline of guard. The old man seized the opportunity, and pulled out an old rifle he had killed a Jack for, learning to shoot it better during an old forgotten war. \n\nHe shot one bullet, lining up the shot so as to hit both of them in the heart. They collapsed, and he stood over them, tearing up. \n\nAs the life drained out of them, he felt a surge of intense power flow into him, but he didn't move. He didn't care. He knew what pain it was to have all his student's lives flow right back to him. Everyone that ever was to have a chance at being a Jack, they had all gone. Immediately his mind thought of one thing, the entire old adage he heard as a child:\n\n\"A Jack of all trades is a Master at none.\"",

Like deja vu, except all the sudden I felt like I had knowledge about turning pipes and flushing toilets,\u201d Jack sucked in a breath, \u201cOf course I stop my car and get out to check if this guy\u2019s okay...He ain\u2019t...So I reach into his pocket to see if he\u2019s got an id on him.\u201d\n\nJack dug around in his pocket, eventually pulling out a card and flicking it at Kate.\n\n\u201cJack O\u2019Dougle,\u201d she read, \u201cO\u2019Prairie Plumbing.\u201d After another moment spent staring at it, she reached into her pocket and took out a lighter. \n\n\u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d Jack said, unconsciously reaching for the card. \n\nKate pulled away, lighting the card at the corner. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot Jack,\u201d she said, \u201cnow continue.\u201d\n\nJack grimaced, \u201cI get back in my car and I\u2019m about to call you when I see this notification. Like one of those Amber Alert pop ups. It says...\u201d\n\nKate rolled her eyes, \u201cYou already told me what it said. What did you do next, obviously you didn\u2019t come straight here.\u201d\n\n \u201cWell, I got to thinkin. I can\u2019t just leave the body there, I\u2019ve got to hide it.\u201d\n\nKate\u2019s eyes opened wide and her nostrils flared. \u201cSo help me GOD Jack Harris, if there\u2019s a dead plumber in my driveway.\u201d\n\nJack laughed, \u201cThere ain\u2019t. Just listen.\u201d \n\nKate settled back, composing herself. \n\n\u201cI remembered I had a friend back when we were kids, Jackson George Jr. Remember him from Clairemont? He\u2019s a detective now, so I figured if anybody would know what to do it\u2019d be the guy that deals with this type of stuff all the time,\u201d Jack said.\n\nKate\u2019s face went white, \u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I did or didn\u2019t because you keep interrupting,\u201d Jack said angrily. \n\nKate waved her hand for him to continue, her eyes saying he walked on thin ice. \n\nJack gulped, then continued carefully, \u201cSo I remembered he used to live a few blocks down, so I put the plumber in the trunk and I drove over. Turns out he moved away a while back, but his folks are still there. Lucky for me, Jack George Sr was a cop for half a century or somethin. So I clonked him upside the head, and BOOM, suddenly I\u2019m Sherlock Homes.\u201d\n\nKate let out a sigh of relief, \u201cOh thank god,\u201d she said, \u201cI thought you went to the feds on me.\u201d She laughed and added, \u201cAnd it\u2019s \u2018Holmes\u2019, you big nub.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhatever...With that cop junk in my head I knew how to make sure no one could trace the kills back to me,\u201d Jack said.\n\nKate looked at her watch, frowning, \u201cAnd then you came right here?\u201d\n\nJack grinned, \u201cNot exactly. Remember when we went over Jack and Eileen Frances\u2019 house for New Years, and Eileen said the best part about marrying a Yoga Instructor was the... \u201c\n",

            "comment": "The first time, he had been scared and horrified of what he had done. He believed the voice was simply a delusion he had created to distract from the real issue: the dead man lying at his feet. In a panic, Jack hauled the body into the trunk of his car and buried him outside of town. He had a family after all, his kids needed him. He couldn't go to jail for this. After a good shower to wash off the dirt and blood, a few panic attacks, and almost turning himself into the police from the guilt, Jack had finally calmed down and tried to forget the events of that night.\n\nThe next day, Jack was awoken by his eldest son.\n\n\"Hey dad... I think there's something wrong with the sink.\"\n\nThat was the day Jack learned he was a plumber. Without a single hiccup, Jack easily repaired the sink. He had never been particularly good at plumbing and yet...\n\nHis mind drifted back to the night before.\n\nTHERE CAN ONLY BE ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES\n\n------\n\nThree years had passed since that night. Now, artist, gardener, writer, pilot, doctor, plumber, and welder Jack sat in the living room. Not a single sound came from within the house aside from Jack's slow breathing.\n\nAmy had taken the kids years ago when Jack tried to tell her what was happening.\n\nHe tried to tell her. He could still remember the horrified look on her face when he told her about the wreck. The nightmares. The voice. She fled faster than he'd seen some of his Jacks run. It was a miracle she didn't report him to the police.\n\nNot that he cared. Amy wasn't a Jack. He felt no interest in her anymore.\n\nJack sat on the edge of the couch, waiting, listening until the telltale sound of a car approaching the driveway met his ears, followed by the car door shutting.\n\nAfter Plumber Jack and a later somewhat accidental Doctor Jack-- Jack had admitted himself into a hospital on a temporary lapse in judgement, then panicked when Doctor Jack had attempted to keep him there, lashing out in fear-- Jack now knew all about The Game of Jacks. For every Jack he killed, he would gain their knowledge of the world, along with their skills.\n\nJack stood as he heard the person on the other side of the door fumbling with their keys.\n\nAll Jacks knew of the game. It was kill or be killed, and Jack always struck first, before The Jacks could do anything to him. The Jacks were deceptive, skilled. Often, they'd be perfectly capable of blending in, acting like a normal citizen, but Jack knew. Every Jack knew. So when a new neighbor moved in, announcing to all that he was a Jack, Jack knew he had to do something before New Jack moved in for the kill. Jack was usually meticulous about The Jacks, careful to do research on a New Jack's skills and life. Working to ensure that he left no evidence, but this was different. This New Jack was close, able to attack him when he wasn't prepared. Jack had to be a bit reckless for once.\n\nWhich was why he was waiting in New Jack's living room for New Jack to come home from his late shift at work.\n\nThe front door opened with a click and Jack grinned at the New Jack that walked freely into the percieved dark safety of his own home. Jack briefly wondered what sort of knowledge this Jack held and what kind of exciting fun was to be had at the misery of his death. Jack had learn to enjoy the kills, and he never got caught. After all, he was Jack: artist, gardener, writer, pilot, programmer, musician, doctor, plumber, welder, knife collector, blood enthusiast, hunter, and serial killer. The Jack of All Trades.\n\nJack stifled a maniacal chuckle as New Jack met with the end of his knife and Jack was given a new title to add to his list: A Friendly Neighbor.",

            "comment": "Still hearing the last fading notes of the bizarre message reverberating inside his skull, Jack stepped out of his car and into the cool morning air. He cautiously walked around the front of his SUV, struggling desperately to organize his thoughts into some semblance of normal functioning. Intrusive thoughts about pipe bores, water flow, and manual valves, subjects he could swear he knew nothing about, kept jostling to the forefront of his brain. \n\n\u201cJesus, get a grip, Jack\u201d he mumbled to himself, raising his hand to wipe the rapidly cooling sweat off his forehead. Jack peered around the hood of his car, steeling himself to see the mangled body of a deer, or worse. He knew the bump he\u2019d heard before.. before... whatever that was... wasn\u2019t just a pothole. \n\nTo his surprise, despite the crumpled hood and steaming radiator, there was nothing in the road, nothing under the car. Just a shiny, vaguely man-shaped, spectral imprint. Before his eyes the glittering outline slowly dissapeared. Before Jack could react the booming voice inside his head returned: \n\nWELCOME JACK 167,233,432 THERE ARE CURRENTLY 6  ACTIVE JACKS WITHIN YOUR ZONE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW THEIR LOCATION?\n\nJack felt the confusion he had been feeling since the bump fade away. He knew exactly what he had to do. Jack tightened his fists and turned to his car, steeling himself with resolve.\n\n\u201cBye have a nice day\u201d said the portly middle-aged woman behind the desk. Her voice exuded warmth but she was not looking up from the papers spread out before her.\n\n\u201cThanks\u201d he replied, turning to leave as he collected his papers, flashing a smile that felt too tight around the lips.  \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d Jack wondered to himself, the eerie certainty he had been gripped with earlier fading now that the deed had been completed. \u201cHave I totally lost it?\u201d It was too late now, he resolved, the deed was done. He had already signed the forms and paid the fee. Besides, even it was crazy, Jack was a pretty boring name anyways. What was the harm? Even if the idea of some supernatural colosseum of Jacks, once frighteningly real, was beginning  to seem crazier and crazier, he liked his new name. \n",

            "comment": "6:49 PM. That was the time that was displayed on the dash of my work van as I sat in evening rush hour. What seemed to be buckets of water instead of raindrops were falling from the sky, wind was howling through the open cracks in my piece of shit work van (I should really get a better one and write it off) and lightning was illuminating the horizon with incredible frequency. The conditions were bad, and it was taking well over 2 hours to move what has been exactly 3.4 miles out of the 30 that I need to complete. At this rate, perhaps it will take 20 hours to get home? Who knows, I didn't become a welder for no reason. Dinner is at 7:30 and I was meeting with my buddy to discuss his bachelorette party so more progress on my commute needed be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI look to my right, and the next exit reads \"RAVEENA BLVD NE 65TH ST\". Perfect. I could've just gone up Ravenna to East Green Lake Way, and just go up Aurora. So I get off at the exit. Big fucking mistake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get off the freeway and make my way up Ravenna. I got up to about 45 as the road opened up and there was space. Look to my phone and see a message from Jack. \"On my way now. Might be late, don't hear good things about traffic on the 5 according to Waze\". Perfect, I had more time and can slow down a little. I lift my foot of the gas and started to type something along the lines of \"No worries\" before I lurch foward and I can no longer see anything. Fuck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI look up and as I slam on the brakes, the man flies off of my windscreen and just falls onto the road. Before I can swerve to avoid him, I drive over what seems to be a speed bump. I can barely muster the ability to hit the brakes in a smooth, consistent fashion and pull to the side of the road. My hands shake and I feel sick. There's no way he is alive. I had just killed a man in a matter of seconds, and I didn't even need to rush. I slowly climb out of my van, eyes filling with water, not sure if it is the rain or my tears from taking someone's life. In the 500 yards it takes for me to travel to his body, thoughts of incarceration, my wife finding another man and leaving me, losing any chance of a prosperous future, upsetting my mother, father and everyone I know for deciding to speed and text in poor conditions that ended up at the expense of some random guy. I approach the body and there is so much blood. He is unrecognizable. Look at the shirt and it reads \" Jack's Plumbing\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy god. I just killed one of Jack's employees. I start to clear out what I texted him and start to communicate to him that something has just gone very wrong. I look at my phone and stare at it. Nope. I rewrite \"No worries\" and send it off. As I am running my hands down this mans body and sobbing, I feel a vibration. I just killed my best friend. Before I can even think about this, the skill of plumbing immediately downloads into my brain, and I get a notification: \"**WELCOME TO THE GAME, JACK. KILL OR BE KILLED, THE CHOICE IS YOURS. THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES\".** He is already gone. I need to fight for myself, and my kids. I get up and run towards my vehicle, and realized i can no longer drive it. It is covered in skin fragments, blood on the windscreen and is slightly damaged. I start to walk away as if I could escape a fatal car accident during evening rush hour in Seattle. A police officer shows up to the scene of the accident, and asks me for my recollection of events. I tell him, he nods his head, identifies the body, establishes that the my buddy to be dead and asks me for my drivers licence, registration and insurance. I pull out my wallet and give him my licence. I read his badge and it read  \"J. Martins\". He comments \"my name is also Jack\" and looks at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGotta kill this motherfucker. Life has this way of presenting opportunities in the most unconventional circumstances possible, but its time to spring into action. I had no choice. He turned around to walk to his car and told me to get my registration and insurance in my vehicle. The paramedics and firefighters are on the way, and there will soon be even more witnesses. I will have no chance to kill this guy and I will be killed. I see him slowly walking to his car but I know he is watching me. There is a pause in his step and his head is slightly tilted in my direction. But this is my chance. I hastily change direction and slowly approach him as if I have to ask a question. He turns around, pulls out his gun, and pulls the trigger at point-blank range. \n\n \n\nThe officer looks at his dead body and blown up head, looks at the dead plumber and comments \"Two birds with one stone.\" He looks at his radio, breathes in, yells into the pager and shakes up his voice as if he were terrified. \"BACKUP NEEDED. MAN WAS RESISTING AND TRIED TO TAKE MY GUN. I HAD TO USE LETHAL FORCE\". The officer looks into the distance, walks to his car and waits for backup. He looks down and mumbles \"There can only be one Jack of all trades, and guess who's gonna be that person\" before slyly laughing to himself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Jack was a nice guy. He really was. When I ran him over, I was scared to death. I got out instantly and saw him lying there on the ground, dead. \"Shit\" I mutter. I just killed a man. I looked closer, realizing this as Jack Marize. He lived on my street and attended the street parties. We weren't that close of friends, but we talked sometimes. He bought me a drink once and told me not to worry about it. He would participate in community service hours. He was in the lower class, but he still donated a third of his salary to charity. \n\n\"Oh, Jack.\" Suddenly pain flares through my head.   Pictures flash by my eyes. My body begins to shake and my eyes roll up. \"WELCOME TO THE GAME, JACK. KILL OR BE KILLED, THE CHOICE IS YOURS. THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES.\"\n\nMy shaking body stops. My eyes return to focus. Reality grabs onto me. But something is different. I can't place my finger on it yet. I stumble to my feet and see the dead Jack on the ground. Suddenly, I realize what it is. I can fix sinks and toilets and... I'm a plumber. I look down at Jack, realizing he, too, is a plumber. Was that some sort of coincidence? No... I was a plumber because I killed a plumber named Jack. A plumber with my same name. I pick up the corpse, blood dripping out of his crushed leg, and carry him to the side of the road. I toss him off and begin to cover his body with sticks. \n\nI arrive home later that night, a phone book in my arms. I carry it inside and open it. J... Ja.... Jack.  There were six Jack's in the book including me and Jack Marize. Four left... \n\nI arrive at a house at seven P.M. The sun is setting  behind a mountain. I knock on the door, a knife hidden against my back. I have a box in my hands. I knock again, waiting. Footsteps echo through the house. The door opens and Jack Arblont is standing in front of me. \"Here is a package\" I say shoving it into his arms. He takes it, confused. Suddenly the knife is in my hand. I swing it at him. He stumbles back and falls, the box falling on top of him, containing six cans of soda. I pounce on him when he screams for help. I hear a frantic cry upstairs when I slash Jack Arblont's neck open. He goes silent and still. I hear footsteps running down the stairs. I jump up and sprint out the open door to cries of sadness behind.\n\nJack Arblont was a free climber and recorded his stunts. He had the ability to manage cameras with one hand while hanging off a cliff, climb insane  and slopes, jump higher than the average human and had incredible climbing strength and speed. One moment I would be no match against him in a climbing contest. The next, we would be side by side in an intense competition. Three Jack's left.\n\nMy knife concealed at my side, my skills concealed inside me, I waited at the entrance to Jack Figalo's house. The door creaked open and adrenaline rushed through my veins. Then I see a small boy standing in front of the door. \"Hello\" he says. He couldn't be more than seven. \"Is Jack Figalo home?\" \"I'm Jack Figalo.\" \"What?\" \"That's me. My name is Jack Figalo.\" \"But... Your name is in the phone book for this house?\" \"Yeah. My dad's name is Jack Figalo too, but he was killed three days ago.\" Killed three days ago. Did that mean? Other Jack's were also looking for me? \"What did you need?\" \"What?\" \"You said you were looking for Jack Figalo. That's me.\" Guilt ran through my bones. Could I really kill a child... just for more skill. What could this boy even give me? *One Jack of all trades.* Words rang through my head. The boy would have to go.\n\nThe seizure happened anyways, though no information was automatically downloaded in my head. I was still filled with guilt, knowing I really messed up. *Only be one Jack.* The words pushed me on. Two left. I continued my journey.\n\nJack Lansan would be a harder target. He was a retired veteran and a police officer. I stood outside his house. His roof was low and light flooded from the windows. I could hear conversation coming from inside. I started developing a plan...\n\nI rung the doorbell than jumped up, clinging to the roof. I swung myself over until I was on the roof. The knife was clutched in my hand, now stained red on almost all the blade. The door opened and a figure stepped out. I was ready to pounce. Than I realized she was a woman. She looked left, then right. \"No one's even hear, Jack\" she called inside. \"Jen? Jen! Get inside. Lock the door! Don't go out again.\" The door shut and a bullet pierced through the wood. This would be a problem.\n\nJack Lansan would have to wait. I went to the next house, the home of Jack Poller and knocked.  The door opened and a young woman, maybe seventeen, stepped out. Her eyes were red. \"Jack Poller?\" Tears fell down her face. \"He was murdered.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"Thank you. What did you want with him?\" *Oh just to kill him.* \"To give my apologies. He was a good man.\" One left.\n\nJack Lansan killed two other Jacks, I assumed. Although, I killed three, I still only had the knowledge of two of them. I still regretted that decision. I was perched on the roof of Jack Lansan's house, waiting. Soon enough, a car pulled in the driveway and out stepped a man in a police uniform. A gun was still strapped to his belt. That could be useful. He walked down the path to the front door. I was ready with a pile of knives and one large steak knife to do the final job. Behind the cover of the roof, I picked up two of the throwing knives and stood up, chucking them toward Jack Lansan. Moments later, two more flew past. One of the knives handle hit his chest. He jumped back as another one slammed into the ground where he just was. A bullet hit the roof I was behind. Luckily, it didn't make it through. I peeked out the other side of the roof and chucked two more knives. One impaled his shoulder. The other sailed harmlessly past. \"Ahg!\" He let out a strangled scream. I peeked again and saw his gun on ground. I jumped off the roof and sprinted toward him. I kicked the gun away and pushed him to the ground raising the steak knife... \"Drop it!\" The voice was behind me. I had the blade to Jack Landan's throat. I looked over my shoulder. His wife was standing there, the gun in her hand, pointed right toward me. \"Drop the knife\" she ordered. \"I will after you drop the gun\" I say. \"Drop the gun or he dies.\" Jack Lansan shouted to his wife. \"No! Don't trust him. He's after the power of Jack!\" \"What are you talking about?\"  \"Just ask his name\" Jack Lansen shouted. \"My name is Don. And I am arresting you for the killing of two good men: Jack Poller and Jack Figalo.\" \"What?\" His wife screeched. \"I'm sorry Mrs. Lansan. Your husband has committed the crime of murderer. I just want to bring him in to treat and question him.\" \"HE'S AFTER THE POWER OF JACK. DO NOT TRUST HIM JEN.\" \"I can treat him\" I assured her. \"We can make him better. Just drop the gun.\" \"I just want my husband back.\" She was crying. I heard the gun fall. \"NO! JEN SHOOT HIM! SHOOOOT HIM!!!\" My hand pressed down more, slashing his neck. I got up and sprinted away to the sobs of Jen Lansen. A bullet flew past, but her aim was no match of what mine was about to become. *About to become.* My body dropped like a rock and the seizure began. It was three times more painful than normal.\n\nJack Lansen was a veteran in the military and a cop. His aim with his gun was incredible. He could hit a bulls eye with his eyes closed. He had indurance of a marathon runner. You never knew what might happen on the job. He had extensive knowledge of most weapons and knew how to handle them better than most. He also knew how to drive. His police car had to beable to navigate extensive traffic issues. When it came to being a cop, Jack Lansen knew mostly all there was.\n\nJack Figalo was a college professor. He had extreme intelligence, especially in the form of Physics, the class he taught and Jackson University. He could get students to cooperate, and could be nice and strict at the same time. \n\nJack Poller was a waiter. He had an uncanny ability to remember orders and balance plates. He was very friendly and social and could normally get customers to keep on buying food. \n\nPain erupted in my leg just as the pain in my head stopped. \"You son of a bitch!\" My surroundings cleared and I saw the face of Jen Lansen above me. \"Why!\" She shot me again in the other leg. I screamed out a sob of pain. \"Why!\" She was screaming at me. My body was on fire. The preservance of six Jacks' kept me going. I reached for a knife at my belt. She screamed at me again and shot at my arm. The bullet hit the concrete next to it and I went still. She pounced on me, dragging my arm out and beating it with the cold, hard piece of metal. I cried out in agony as she just went harder. \"Stop. Please.\" \"FUCK YOU!\" She went on, beating on my arm. It felt flat and deflated. I could feel blood soaking through the skin like orange juice soaking through the peel. She kneeled over me now. \"Fuck you.\" She aimed the gun at my other arm when I made a grab for it. I got the barrel in my grasp. She tugged it upward, but I held on tightly, the punishment of death and Six Jacks driving me on. I pushed it away, but she pushed it back. I was injured and weak, she was angry and strong. I tried to get it from her grip and she tried to get it from mine. We were both screaming now, at eachother, at the pain of loss, at the sheer shit that life gave us. It was like an endless tug a war match, with a gun. Whoever lost, died. I'll just say it was a very close match... \n",

            "comment": " I stood over the body, numb, at a complete loss of what to do. For the second time I held a hand to his neck, different fingers this time, I could never remember which was the wrong one to use, but it was still the same. No pulse. He was dead. I\u2019d killed someone.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to do. Call the police on myself? I guess I had to. I found myself reaching into his pocket for his phone though. I needed to know his name I guess. I also needed to message someone he knew. His family. His girlfriend. His boyfriend. Whoever it was that I could find. Someone needed to know.\n\nI found it, and pulled it out, surprised that it was undamaged. Funny that. The smallest impact always shattered mine, but this guy had been hit by a car and his was still immaculate. As I thought about this, I realised I was probably still in shock, and just a little bit unstable. As I saw what popped up on his phone screen, I *knew* I was.\n\nIt simply read *RIP JACK*, in big, white letters.\n\n*What the fuck*? How did he know I- But even as I watched, the letters disappeared, replaced by another sentence. *Put the plumbing to good use, Jack*.\n\nI stared. \u201cWhat the fuck does that mean?\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going crazy\u2026\u201d That or the phone was haunted by a confusing ghost.\n\nAnother message appeared. *Not crazy. What\u2019s the function of a trap*?\n\nEven as I repeated the word crazy in my head, I heard myself speak. \u201cIn drainage a trap is what keeps sewage from spilling back into the house, basically forming a seal with water and air. Typically they\u2019re seen in the S-shaped piping under a sink or-\u201d I trailed off, shocked. I didn\u2019t know where that knowledge had come from, but it was there. Like a firework in my head, the thought that started out as traps and drainage blossomed into a journey that covered piping and drainage and sewage and-\n\n\u201cWhat. The. Fuck,\u201d I said again. I was really original in the face of new experiences.\n\n*You\u2019re a plumber, Harry.* The phone said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n*You don\u2019t need to. What you do need to do is run. There\u2019s someone on the way.*\n\n\u201cThe police?\u201d\n\n*You\u2019re not so lucky. Let\u2019s just say* this *Jack started off as a butcher. And he knows where you live.*\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s coming for me? Why?\u201d\n\n*To kill you. There can only be one Jack of All Trades.*\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 Who *are* you?\u201d\n\n*Jack, of course.*\n\nThe screen flashed, suddenly, and was replaced by the picture of a man holding a chubby, orange cat. I recognised him. He was the man I\u2019d just killed. I reached over to the duffel he was carrying and opened it up. Wrenches, piping, everything I know recognised as the essential tools of a plumber. Had I\u2026 taken his knowledge?\n\nThere was a wallet too. His name on his ID? Jack.\n\nIt was too much. My head spun, but I found myself getting into my car and driving away, leaving the other Jack lying on the road. How had those messages come through on the phone? Who was after me, and why? Of course, I had an idea now, crazy at it seemed. He wanted my knowledge, my skills.\n\nWould someone really kill to be a welder though? A plumber? I guess it saved you a few years of trade-school. I almost laughed at the thought. Definitely still in shock.\n\nI was home twenty minutes later, heart hammering, pressed up against the window. I was torn in half. Part of me believed those mysterious messages; after all, the plumbing part was the weirdest, and that was proven beyond a doubt. One glance at my bathroom now was enough for that. On the other hand, it was just too much, too soon. Someone was coming to kill me? I didn\u2019t believe that part.\n\nUntil that van pulled up outside my house, and a stocky man stepped out. Even if the way he looked at my home and the knife-roll he held in his hands didn\u2019t give it away, the van did. *Jack\u2019s Meats*. It was true. It was all true.\n\nIt was a good thing I\u2019d prepared myself.\n\nI don\u2019t know how, but my locked door didn\u2019t stop him long. He didn\u2019t break it. Maybe he\u2019d found the locksmith Jack. Either way, I heard him walking up my stairs, all confidence, a minute later. I waited until he was halfway before turning the lever.\n\nIt was a matter of a minute to rig up a pipe to the supply, alongside a hose that stretched to the top of the stairs. Smooth, wooden stairs. The kind that were very dangerous when you walked up them after a rainstorm. I knew that. This Jack didn\u2019t. As the water poured down towards him though, he soon found out. Once he knew I knew he was there, he threw away all attempts at subtlety.\n\nOf course, the second he tried to run on those wet steps, he tumbled right down. It sounded like it hurt, but I had no illusions that it wouldn\u2019t finish him. I pulled my welders goggles on and waited. A faint splash, followed by another. Back on the stairs, but moving carefully. I lit my welders torch, and a dangerous blue flame sprang from it, the kind that damaged your eyes if you looked at it.\n\nA gunshot rang out, followed swiftly by two more. He couldn\u2019t look directly at the light, but he wasn\u2019t far off target. The bullets cut through where I would have been standing, if I hadn\u2019t taped the torch to the banister. While he was distracted, halfway up the stairs, covering his eyes, I dropped something on his head from behind. I was going to just use a wrench, but I settled for the whole bag of tools instead.\n\nWhen I suddenly knew how to cut up a cow, disassemble a gun, use watercolours, write a screenplay, and investigate a crime scene, I knew it was over. I also knew that last skill was going to come in handy.\n\nWhen I fished out his phone, there was another message. *You\u2019re a quick learner. That\u2019ll come in handy over the next few days.*\n\n\u201cHow many more are out there?\u201d\n\n*Less every day. Get ready, Jack.*",

            "comment": "Jack looked at the card in disbelief, the idea that a man would plan for his death with a joke. \n*A bad joke.* It was absurd and insane and impressive all at once, and perhaps.. Perhaps he'd have contemplated it further, seeing that it was unlikely a prankster had prepared so perfectly that he couldn't help but be killed by a man named Jack. Perhaps, but in fact he did not do any of that. He was in the middle of the road, half asleep and covered in the viscera of a man he'd flippantly decided to call, \"Jack Shit\".\n\nHe scouted around. He saw empty storefronts and streets for as far back as the night would allow. Over the horizon he saw the neon blur of a gas station sign.\n\nThere, he thought. I'll get to the gas station and phone the police. If I wash the blood off, I'll look less like a murderer. \n\nHe got back in his car and carefully maneuvered around the mangled corpse of Jack Shit, then he set off towards the gas station. Fully aware that he was going 5 miles under the speed limit, but not entirely sure of why. The low speed left him exposed to passersby, they'd see his blood spattered radiator grill, move on to noticing the dented hood and immediately think he was looking for his next victim.  Jack couldn't bring himself to speed though, he felt as though he was being watched. \n\nWhen he entered the gas station, he asked the clerk for the key to the restroom. The clerk sighed. The Clerk sat behind the safety glass with his face practically pressed into a magazine.\n\n\"Dude, it's unlocked,\" said the Clerk. \n\nJack left $5 on the counter and grabbed a bottle of club soda. \n\nIt should be said that he absolutely tried his best to not rush into the bathroom; it should also be noted that Jack failed miserably. He washed his face, flipped his black shirt inside out, scrubbed his pants and began to comb his hair. \n\n\"So you're finally in the game, huh?\"\n\nHe came to an abrupt stop when he heard the toilet flush three times in quick succession.\n\nA young man wearing wayfarers emerged from the stall. Jack turned to the man, hands still soapy.\n\n\"Let's not shake hands,\" said the young man. \"You don't want what I've got and I don't-\"\n\n\"Who the fuck are you?\"\n\nThe young man began to wash his hands very slowly, meticulously going over each finger. \n\n\"Obviously, I'm in the game too. Ok, so every time a local Jack dies in the game, we get an all Jack bulletin. Lets us know what you look like and gives a general location.\"\n\nJack have the young Jack a look. Young Jack nodded and said,\" I don't wanna fight you. Seems like an unfair fight.\" \n\nJack had never actually been in a fight, not exactly. He'd been punched out several times, but was only ever aware that he'd been in a fight until well after the fight was over. He needed to go with Young Jack's assumption, feeling a creeping, nameless dread.\n\nThey exited the gas station and walked around to the side of the building. Jack felt an ease wash over him, then it began to push down his anxiety. Young Jack pulled out a vape and began puffing laconically. He seemed to stare right past Jack.\n\n\"So why be the Jack of all-\"\n\n\"Because you'd have a fucking Monopoly. A Monopoly on knowledge,\" said Young Jack. \"Well, you won't. You'll be dead in a few minutes.\"\n\nJack realized that his pants were still stained, he did an awful job at washing. \n\n\"You see, I'm the Alpha and Omega of onanism. Jack Hoff. I've circled the globe jerking off wise men in search of enlightenment. Beating off other Jacks when I could. I've gotten to the point that I can kill a man within three orgasms before he knows he's been manhandled.\"\n\nJack held up his left hand revealing a sticky index finger, \"You're on nut number two. I got you in the restroom and just now. Soon, your heart will race and you'll have an aneurysm. You should never trust a silent pooper.\"\n\nThe welder in him told Jack to run, take a cold shower and to live to be molested another day. \nThe plumber in Jack thought about how hard it was to clean jism out of a gas station toilet. In a rage, Jack pushed Mr. Hoff onto the ground and stuffed the vape down his throat. He watched as smoke rose from behind Mr. Hoff's glasses and his legs convulsed until finally, he died. \n\nMemories flooded into Jack's mind. Learning to squeeze eclair in Paris, training with Shaolin monks in the art of the Five Finger Knuckle Shuffle of Death. Jack realized that despite frequent practice, he'd been doing it all wrong. \n\nHe might have rectified that, but he heard someone clapping a very sarcastic clap. Jack turned to see the Clerk standing behind him, he held an ornate scarf wrapped around his knuckles. A nametag on his shirt read \"Jacket\".\n\nJack tried hard to not roll his eyes. \n\n\"Contrived, I know,\" said Jacket. \nJacket punched Jack in the face and unleashed a barrage of expert jabs. Jack felt his nose crunch and his jaw nearly dislocate. He fell back and rolled into the mud. Jacket jumped on his back and started to throttle him with the scarf. \n\n\"How's,\" said Jack. \"...a jacket a... Boxer?\"\n\n\"Oh. No, I'm a seamster,\" said Jacket. \" I *killed* Jaw Jack, he was a boxer. Y'know, 'trade' is actually a pretty broad term...\"\n\nJack jammed his comb into Jacket's throat. A desperate move, but it caused him to gag and loosen his grip. Jack scrambled to his feet. \n\nHe might've formulated a plan, but a man in a Dickie's jumpsuit ran behind Jacket and bashed in his skull with a tire iron. \n\nThe jumpsuited man rubbed his temple. \"Finally can fix my goddamn socks. Hydraulic Jack, pleased to beat ya... Oh and here.\"\n\nHydraulic Jack threw Jack a pipe wrench. He gestured at it and Jack picked it up. \n\n\"I don't fight an unarmed man... twice in the same night.\"\n\nThey fought across the parking lot, through the car wash and ultimately they approached a small hill. Jack felt his shoulders turn to rubber and his knees buckled. He tumbled towards the ground and felt his wrench lazily connect with Hydraulic Jack's knee. H. Jack lost balance and rolled down the hill, the crown of his head made a sickening crack against the cold ground. \n\n\nJack napped in the dirt, not caring who else could find him dog tired and defenseless. He had the knowledge of how to fix his car so no Jack could see him coming until it was too late. He could box better than the champ, he could stitch up his own wounds and pad his clothes for combat. He could put a man at ease with Le Petit Mort while setting him up for the big death.\n\nHe had the high ground, he was the big Jack cheese, King of the Hill.  \n",

            "comment": "\u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. This must be some sort of a joke\u201d Jack Lee said to himself. His windshield was still showing the smokey outline of the tree the car slammed into, together with the trickles of blood from the person laying on top of his murder instrument. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a dream\u201d he continued \u201cthen what kind of a sick reality show is this? Those whites maniacs must be on some sort of prank again.\u201d\n\nBeing on the foreign land made him so much more adaptable than whoever were still back on the mainland, but he was pretty certain he didn\u2019t adapt to fixing any kind of 18th crntury French style plumbing in New Orleans, being a welder for almost half a decade in California. And yet, right now, he could name each exact type of tool and the four sizes of pipe and the amount of connectors and sealant needed for fixing the rusted over pipeline in his house which had stopped working since Sunday.\n\nNo, he concluded, this situation, whatever it was, must have been some sort of bad hallucinations. He kicked open the half cumbled door, trying to get out of the crappy 82 sedan he bought from a sleazy dealer. As he crumbled onto the ground, the smell of fresh blood snuck into his nose, alerting him that this was gonna be some bad trip. Regardless, his stomachs decided to empty out its content, creating a buddle of steam on the burnt asphalt mixed with car tyre.\n\nA flash of red and blue charged foward, alerting Jack Lee of the approaching officer. He tried to stand up, only to find his legs somehow spaghettified under his weight, while his head dropped like a bag of lead. He barely heard the officer voice; asking him or ordering him to stay on the ground like murderer he was, Jack wasn\u2019t sure. But he felt being lifted onto his feet and escorted to the hazy vehicle in white and black. He could feel being seated onto the passenger side, being asked for something else, he\u2019a not quite sure. His fingers reaches for his pocket like a programed robot, but nothing was there for him to reach. As the officer walked toward his banged up car, his mind finally solidified, and his heart immediately skipped a beat.\n\nOn the dashboard, there was the face of the man lying atop his car. It\u2019s a criminal record of drug use, and the name Jack E. Smiths, and it listed the current known occupation as \u201cPlumber for Hammer Prowell Inc.\u201d. \n\n\u201cHow did this random officer have the exact warrant for the man I\u2019ve just crashed into?\u201d The thought clawed at Jack Lee. His eye dashed across the vehicle interior looking for answer. As if hearing his question, the officer\u2019s tag dangled from the rear mirror: MacBorough, J.\n\nHis eyed then locked on to the face of Officer Jack MacBorough, whose hand was holding Jack Lee\u2019a driver license. And at that instance, the officer\u2019s beaming gaze gave all the answer Lee needed.\n\nHe may not have knwn how to fight, but he sure as hell knew how to not drive over people. He reached over to release the handbreak, his other hand pressing on the gas just as two 9mm bullet pierces the wind shield of the police vehicle.\n\n5 seconds. It was all it took. And yet, that 5 seconds felt like years, and pieces of glass rain onto Lee, while sound of discharged firearm pounded on his ears. After what must have been an eternity, a loud thud followed by a scream signalled the end of the harrowing experience. Shifting the gear into reverse, Lee hit the pedal again, and a sickly crunch ended the unearthly scream of pain and anguish.\n\nAlmost immediately, loud thunderous drone of an invisible voice filled Lee\u2019s head, not too dissimilar to the earlier voice of the officer:\n\nSkill of driving: upgraded. Tackling driving skill tree unlocked.\nSkill of firearm: unlocked.\nSkill of explosive: unlocked.\nSkill of evidence tampering: unlocked.\nSkill of planned serial murder: unlocked.\nSkill of police protocol: unlocked.\nSkill of tracking: unlocked.\nSkill of investigation: unlocked.\n\nThe shear amount of knowledge that bombarded Jack\u2019s brain would have made anyone mad. But for him, it\u2019s as if he had been doing it for ages. As he pondered what sick machination was at play, his investigative skill kicked in: a small compartment was hidden right under the driving wheel. His curious hand immediately reached for the contraption, and pulled out a thick book of filing. Along the opening, multiple memo notes could be seen sticking out. As he read through the name, it dawned on him what his next move would have been.\n\nThe note he opened up led to a profile. The name was centered and bold: Jack Bauer.",

            "comment": "In a construction site in Dubai I walk to an area that has not been welded properly. Damn I think to myself. I look at the other welder indulging in her 20th beer of the hour in a corner with all of her friends. I put down my mask and switch on my blowtorch. I weld on top of the botched job. The sparks fly everywhere and almost hit one of the other welder's friends. \"Damn it Jack. Pay attention to where everyone is before you switch on that damn heat torch.\" says the site idiot.\n\nI saw him run towards my torch when he thought I wasn't looking. He was hoping for a chance to get paid leave and get me fired. Of course, if I get fired then he can slide into the other welder's pants. But, unlike her, I am a master at my job and know what I'm doing. I stand up, push him away from my path and silently stomp towards Jane, the welder. I snatch her 21st beer from her and chug it in a second to her dismay and her friend's anger. I smash the can on my mask which I moved to the top of my head. It is so much more soothing when a beer is drunk under the shadow of my welding. \n\n**\"Times Up\"** booms the voice of the construction site manager. Making sure all of his workers know that they won't get any more money from staying longer. This is mostly directed at One-eyed Mark who stayed here too long and lost an eye from a faulty drill. The contraction company lost a fortune from the following lawsuit but Mark continued working here. Nobody knows why, even himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone files out from fear of losing one of their organs to a faulty piece of machinery. I go into my car, a rust piece of metal so old that the beer I drank could sell for more. I twist the key in the ignition for the fifth time before the hunk of junk actually decides to switch on. I look up to see Mark get in a limo, he would get a Ferrari if he could actually drive it without crashing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI drive through my usual road, time seeming to slow as I drive through the forest where my sick father first taught me how to weld 2 dead animals together. As I am reminiscing in my memories I don't realize that there is someone walking across the road until it is too late. Usually my headlights are off because no sane person would walk in this forest alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI crash into the man with my car, crumpling the front. I run out hoping to god that the wheels don't have any blood on them. The life of the man in front of me is irrelevant, my emotions were long gone from my hellish childhood. As I look at my wheels I mentally gasp in shock as not a speck of blood goes near them. I look to the dying man and see that his blood is slowly evaporating and going into where my wretched heart is. I scramble to my feet as I see clouds circling in the empty sky. I try to run from the crime scene but the clouds form into a face from who's mouth a lightning strike strikes me directly. My heart expands in my chest and I cry for the first time in 20 years as I booming voice 5 times as loud as the construction site manager that says, \"**THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES\"**. I can feel new information loading into my head and I feel like I am hallucinating as I see pipes everywhere, I think back at all the times I saw faulty piece of plumbing and immediately know what was wrong and realize all plumbers are just scammers. I black out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wake up in a house that is toasty. I jump out from the traumatizing event and see paintings throughout the large hall with names starting with Jack. I look at a painting with a face that look like the person I killed with a red X on it. Turn around to a large painting with my face on it and see a man painting and X on it.",

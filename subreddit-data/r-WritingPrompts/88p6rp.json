            "comment": "haha, \"Carl when did you develop a sense of humor?\" I said. \"Carl\"?\nI turned to look over my right shoulder expecting to see my normally morose and impersonal driver only to see one of *them*. \n\n\"Oh fuck me\" I stammered looking into the beady eyes of what has been the sum of all fears since childhood.\n\n\"You are a King not a Queen sire, and I would not be worthy to pollinate you even so\" the little death dealer said.\n\nStung already, auditory hallucinations I have to get help \"Carl!\" I shouted trying to see through the tree line back towards the car near the ferry where Carl must be. Stumbling into a lurching run  ignoring my still open fly. \" Running will increase blood flow spreading the toxin further, stop. Think, call him you idiot!\" \n\n\"My lord please do not distress, we live to serve.\" The same follow the yellow brick road voice said.\n\n\"We are going to be dead in minutes whoever the fuck we is\" I replied pulling out my phone. \"I know it's in here why is it not under C, i should have..\" \n\n\"We are the elite guard pledged to you sire\" Munchkin voices from all sides said at once, causing me to jolt and drop my phone. Lifting my eyes I saw them, dozens no A HUNDRED bees floating in 3 tight lines mere feet in front of me. Death for sure, i'm sorry mom I shouldn't have yelled and insisted learning to fish.\n\nA bee landed on my glasses and I froze staring at it with a kind of resigned horror. \n\n\"Great one, remain calm we do not have long to speak. I can tell by your reaction that we are the first unit to make contact with you\".\n\nSeventeen years, constant vigilance and fear anytime out doors even when on a screened in porch, mother quitting her job to make sure she would be there if I actually got stung. Hiring a ex-military medic to drive me around after they won the local lottery, losing friends because I couldn't be allowed to play outdoors after spring. Wait, ex-medic ...the epi pen! Staring the hallucination in my eye Ii reached to my backpack and pulled out the pen popping the security tab and lifting it to strike my leg it...resisted \n\n\"No my liege you must not!\" the bee said , now sitting on the tip of my nose. \n\nThat's when I saw them crawling all over my hand tiny wings buzzing. Instinctively I yelped then dropped the pen, watching in amazement as they returned to their formation. \"Wh-why \" was all i could get out.\n\n\"Sir it is likely they put one of their chemicals in there, not something to help you but something to knock you out and cause memory loss\" the small death dealer said.\n\n\"They?! you mean my fucking doctor?\", \"I'm talking to a bee now, I wonder if i'm even really still standing. Maybe i'm sprawled out on the ground with foam coming from my mouth as my body rages it's last defiant battle.\n\n\"He would not be your doctor, but theirs, Please majesty you must focus, we have little time the bear is likely already incapacitated or dead by now\"\n\n\"Bear? please tell me Baloo is just around the corner ready to save me\" I said.\n\n\"You know him? I did not know his name sir or that you were aquatined. I hope you and he will accept our apology for all the stings, we merely needed to incite him to violence to distract the human named Carl.\"\n\nThat's when I noticed I was sitting down and it struck home. Carl was *never* out of eyesight or atleast shouting distance. He's paid more than he would make at any ambulance service just to stay by my side in case. He should be here no matter what but...a bear?\n\n\"I'm not hallucinating?\" i said.\n\n\"No my lord, I understand this is a shock but I have been trying to tell you that we are here to rescue you, quickly you must come with us\" the tiny voice said, sounding more confident and resolute\n\nDropping the Epi pen I asked \"So you didn't sting me?\"\n\nThe little bee's wings buzzed quickly and almost fell off my nose. \"Sire it would be more than my wings are worth, my whole colony would kill itself if I dared harm you.\"\n\nDrugs, somebody slipped me something or maybe that stuff that grows on grain and makes you trip balls. Urgot? i think that is what it was called, the cause of the salem witch trials. Well part of the cause ,religious fools that they were.\n\n\"Quickly sire, follow us! Alpha team you're on point, charlie team fall back to the parking lot and observe the human to see if he gives chase, DO NOT BE SEEN.\"\n\nThe three lines of bees flew off in different directions, one toward the parking lot another in thhe opposite direction and the rest formed a halo around my head forming a crown of bees. Thinking that this was kind of cool for a nightmarish hallucination I sprang into action following alpha team.\n\n\"Where are we going...wait what is your name?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is not likely you could say it in your language sire, but you may call me Carl if that seems right.\" the bee said whilst clinging to my glasses against the wind.\n\n\"Oh no, you're way more interesting than a Carl. I will call you Artemis, does that sound ok?\" I said.\n\n\"Named by the prophesied one himself, my lord you humble me to tears\" he replied.\n\nSmiling i found myself thinking this small creature which i hhad come too fear and loathe was actually kind of cute. \"Where are we going Artemis?\" \n\n\"We're going to your Mother sir, she has much to discuss with you.\" he replied\n\n\"Oh Art, i'm sorry but I'm pretty sure my mother would coat me in a fog of raid if she saw you with me\" I chuckled while running along side the river. Strange my asthma isn't bothering me.\n\n\"Not the human you call mother majesty. She was merely assigned to you after your kidnapping. We're going to your REAL mother, our mother, earth's mother Gaia.\" He replied in all seriousness. \"Alpha team this is it, Baker team signal evac team that we are ready to depart.\" He said in that oddly commanding tone for a voice sounding like it was coated in helium.\n\nAnother bee flew close to my glasses and said \" Wings are arleady here sir, 15 seconds\".\n\n\"Set ten of your weakest to wait for charlie team's return after we leave. The human will come this way looking for the king, if you think he suspects what has happened... Kill him.\" Art said.\n\n\" By my Antennae and Sting, life to serve commander. We will fight to the last bee.\" the little one said.\n\nWhat did he mean wings here in 15 seconds Art?\" I asked just before two sets of eagle talons clenched my shoulders and carried me into the sky.",

                            "comment": "\"AHHHHH, wait stop, put me down. Oh my god HHEEEELLLLPPP\" I screamed at the top of my lungs. \n\n\"Your highness I am afraid that they cannot understand you\" Art said, pressed against the lens of my glasses by the wind.\n\n\"I'm going to DIE , Art please tell them to put me down\" I cried looking down at the tree tops passing beneath me. \n\n\"Ahhh, your majesty I am afraid that my instructions were quite clear. I am to bring you to the Mother at all costs even ...even if you yourself command me otherwise.\" He buzzed placatingly managing to actually sound as though this made him ashamed.\n\n\"Oh god i'm going to die, Art this is ridiculous this can't be happening, nope totally not happening. I'm going to close my eyes and when i wake up I will be on the bank of the river wondering what happened to my fishing pole\". Closing my eyes I searched for calmness, trying to wake up so everything would be fine. \"I'm ok , eagles don't fly people around I'm not a hobbit Im a man...or well a boy anyway. Just relax and breath, WAKE. UP.\" \n\nGradually, I slowed my breathing and concentrated on the \"whoof, whoof\" of the beating wings above me. Everything is fine just know this isn't happening and whatever really is happening doesn't involve being 200 feet above the ground. After a minute of this, that drug on like an hour, I slowly opened my eye to vast bright blue sky punctuated by a bee with it's small head cocked. \" Yes, i'm afraid i'm still here sire\" Art said apologetically. \"Would you mind my lord?\" Art sidled across my lens to sit on the side of my nose and began to drink, I hadn't even noticed i'd been crying. \"Ahh that is much better, leading a rescue mission is thirsty work\" he said conversationally as though i'd put it out just for him. \"Look we're over water now and not terribly high up, it will be alright sire my oath on it.\" he pledged\n\nSure enough the most beautiful scene ever unfolded before me, brilliant crystalline blue waters of cumberland lake glided beneath me and in the sky more birds flew nearby, really nearby. \"Art, enough bullshit you're supposed to be a bee but you speak more articulately than anyone in the entire republican party, how does that work with a brain the size of a few atoms strung together, and why are there birds working for you that you can talk to and i can't\"\n\n\"Oh, yes well that, um it's complicated my lord but the gist of it is that i'm not actually speaking, atleast not the way you are.\" He replied sounding a little unsure.\n\n\"So I've done it then, mad as a loon haviing a conversation with a personality in my head while seeing birds and bees. Birds and bees..I wonder if this has something to do with my being a virgin\" I calmly stated while flying through the air.\n\n\"Your majesty is very witty, no sire I am communicating to you through my life force. I think things at you and your brain turns them into words so that you know what i'm thinking.\" he said as though it were the most obvious thing in the world.\n\n\"Art that doesn't even begin to make any sen....ahhhhhh\" i yelled while tumbling briefly through the air to land into the lake. Water rushed up to meet me and for a moment I was actually more worried about Art drowning than myself. \"Art!! are you okay? can you swim?\" Sure ask the bee if  he can swim, you're not losing your wits, YOU NEVER HAD ANY.\n\n\"No, actually big puddles like this one frighten me\" Art said hovering easily above my head. \"If you will follow me great one?\" \n\nOnly then did I notice there was a small island close by , in what must be the very center of cumberland lake. Swimming towards an eagle glided by only inches above the water looking right at me, and then wheeled off climbing higher into the sky. If i hadn't known better i'd have thought she gave me a nod. Wait..she? why did I get the distinct impression she was a she, giving me a motherly check before returning to her lover above. I felt sandy mud touch my feet and I stood walking ashore between the dense roots tangled all around the island. \"I will wait for you here sire, please forgive me for disobeying your order and know that only in this circumstance would that ever happen.\" Art said somberly\n\n\"Wait here? what am I supposed to do? I asked eyeing the copse of trees fearfully.\n\n\"Oh yes, please go inside the Mother is waiting for you\" he replied chiperly.\n\nTaking off my shoes I stood warily for a moment then gathered my courage. I'd come this far right? What could happen next a fish wanting me to come find buried treasure under the lake? \"She's in there?\" i asked nodding towards the jumbled mess of waterwood trees.\n\n\"Mmmmhmmmm\" he said in a very bee like sound that must have been all his own.\n\nWalking forward I couldn't believe that with each step I actually felt more at peace, as though burdens I wasn't aware of were being unloaded from my back. It took only a few yards in and the bright sunlight was cut drastically, yet even beneath this dense canopy flowers bloomed all along the bases of every tree. Some even twining up the trunks, so beautiful in shades of pink and yellow, white and red, and in a small clearing a field of my favorite blue bells. I leaned down to pluck one so that i could take in it's smell.\n\n\"You do not need to kill that to enjoy it's aroma you know\" a feminine voice said from everywhere at once. I stumbled back muttering what was probably supposed to be an apology as I tried to locate the source.\n\n\"Who's-where are you?\" I stammered\n\n\"Everywhere son of stingers, I am all. The sum of every living spirit upon my back even humans, you may call me Gaia\" the voice said\n\"Reach down into the soil with your hands and feel me, for that soil IS me\"\n\nI knelt down and sunk my hands deep into the topsoil, it was so loose and rich. Then it gripped back, gently. I began to weep, i could feel emotions through the dirt. Worry, anger , resignation , hope but more than anything LOVE. I knew in that moment this *was* my mother , all of our mothers and had always been our mother. \n\"Yes I sense you can feel the true-life force flowing into you from my heart sweet boy\" she said in a very...well motherly way. \"You weep because you see now that you are not lost not alone. More than just a collection of atoms and molecules and cells. More than just a man living his own small life cutoff from everything else in the world. Most live their entire lives in this way, but you are far from most men.\" she intoned with an uptick of hope surging through the earth. She was right, as if i'd walked through my entire life with a blindfold on feeling my way around enough to survive but never seeing. Emotion rolled through me in waves and built to a crescendo. In one moment, one long excruciating moment I wanted to dive in to the soil and rejoin mother, gain back everything i'd lost without even knowing i'd lost it. Then it was gone, the feeling and grip of the dirt. Shaking my head a little I asked myself if i had really just thought of killing myself to be closer to her. Am i sane? is this..\n\n\"Take heart young one, all is well with you and your body\" she said as if sensing my returning unease.\n\n\"Why mother, why am i talking to bees and being carried by raptors\" i asked not really sure if i wanted to hear the answer.\n\n\"The hivefolk have long toiled and labored serving all other life, they are the most faithful and noble caretakers\" she said calmly as if trying to let each word sink in to understand it's implications. \"That is why one of their souls was chosen to be placed in a human, the worst caretakers of all.\"\n\n\"Wh-wait, i'm a bee?\" i said sounding as though it were far from the compliment her previous words named it. \n\nMirth rippled through the trees in a breeze. \"You are more than that and more than human, you know in your heart why I have summoned you, do you not?\"\n\n\"We're killing you, aren't we mother? I said as another tear formed in the corner of my eye.\n\n\"The hivebound dwindle in numbers each year, and as a result so do the beautiful things, the flowers, the birds, the bears. The bees cannot keep up and fail at their duty more each year through no fault of their own , while men enslave them for the reward of perfect food that is for the bees alone\". \"Each year I grow a little weaker and I fear that this is but the slope that leads to the cliff, and if the bees fall, all will fall into darkness\"\n\n\"I'm sorry mother , we didn't mean to honestly, we just want..\" I trailed off not really being able to think of what it is that we want, why had we done this, to what end? money? more stuff? \n\n\"You walk alone in your journey as a people, seperate because you have forgotten who you are and to what you belong\". \"You destroy even yourselves in your misguided search for meaning. Meaning that was left discarded so long ago.\"\n\n\"What can we do mom?\" that amused breeze flowed through the branches again. \n\n\"Not what humans can do what YOU can do son of stingers.\"\"It is time for a culling and a rebirth. You, will lead them\"\n\n\"Me? i'm just a kid adults don't listen to kids and even if they did I wouldn't know what to tell them\". I said pleadingly.\n\nThe breeze became a gust and the gust a gale, thunder cracked above and yet...I held no fear for I knew in my heart that it was not for me. \"It is not the humans that you will lead my son.\" \n\n---\n\nEnd of part II. Thanks alot guys, it would be too embarrassing to detail just how much your responses mean to me. I'm going to honor them by continuing this story but more importantly by starting to write regularly since I find that I actually enjoy it when it's not written for a professor. I've created my own subreddit where I will continue the series and post other stuff I write. Don't worry i'm not going to try and sell you on buying something, just doing this because i lack purpose in life, heh. If i'm honest I DO like the compliments too (blush). I'm rambling now i think, always worried people think me too long winded, here is the subreddit if you want to read more! https://www.reddit.com/r/LurkerAscended/",

            "comment": "\"What? Who said that?\", I asked, startled. \n\n\n\"It izz me, Buzzter, your humble servant, sire! Might I take this opportunity to say that it is such an honor to speak with you directly!\" said the annoying voice.\n\n\nThat's when I noticed that the source of the strange voice was a bee, right there on my shoulder. As someone who has been told to stay away from bees all my life, for ungodly things would happen if I so much as touch one, I was scared half to death. \n\n\n\"Aaaah! Get off me, get off me!\"\n\n\n\"Fear not, my king! I mean you no harm!\", said Buzzter as he got off me and spoke hovering from a distance. I took a moment to collect myself and, since I thought a speaking insect was pretty cool, allowed the bee to have its say.\n\n\n\"It seems you have been deceived and brainwashed like we suspected.\"\n\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\"There isn't much time; they'll be here any second.\", he said, and then proceeded to sting me. \n\n\n\"No no no no, don't! Please!\", I yelled, but he had already stung me. I feared the worst, but it caused no pain, and healed within seconds. I have seen quite a few people in immense pain after being stung, so this took me completely by surprise. I looked at Buzzter the bee in astonishment. Before buzzing away, he said: \"If I have gained your trust, come to the bee hive on the third tree in the park two blocks from your home, and come alone. Just say 'I seek my minions' out loud to seek us out. The fate of all bees relies upon your actions, my king!\"\n\n\nJust a second later, my mother opened the door to my room. \"What's wrong, son? I heard shouting.\"\n\n\n\"Nothing, mom\" I replied, \"Rashford missed another shot at goal!\". \n\n\n\"Huh, you and your football!\" she said as she left and closed the door.\n\n\nI couldn't sleep that night, and my curiosity got the better of me, so I sneaked out and I made my way to the park. There was, indeed, a bee hive on the third tree from the park entrance, but lighting was dim and I doubted if I would be able to see the bees even if they did come. I said out loud: \"I seek my minions!\"\n\n\nImmediately, five matchsticks floating in the air lit up. I realized they were not floating, but were being held up by bees, like torches. Then I recognized Buzzter. \"Your Majesty, so good you came!\".\n\n\n\"Umm... yeah... the thing is... I really don't know what...\"\n\n\n\"I apologize deeply for interrupting you, your Majesty, but it appears you have been made to believe that you are allergic to us. Is that correct?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\n\"Those treacherous fiends! They have deceived everyone!\"\n\n\n\"Who are we talking about here?\"\n\n\n\"My apologies! I will let our great storyteller/narrator bee, Morgan Beeman, to tell you the great story of the bees!\"\n\n\n\"Greetings, your Majesty\" said Morgan Beeman, and started with the story...\n\n\n\"Long ago, all species of bees lived in harmony in their respective ecosystems, and produced honey in peace. The biggest nuisance was the occasional bear who would attack for honey, but the hive would be rebuilt and harmony restored. However, beedom would encounter an enormous threat to its well being - the threat of humans! The humans, inherently greedy mammals who claim supremacy on this planet even though our absence would set in motion events that would lead to their doom in a short span of time, are greedy bastards. Their greed for honey lead them to steal from us on a massive scale, causing irreparable destruction and death and figure out ways to capture and enslave our beeple in concentration camps to produce honey for their wants! But there was a ray of hope for us, in the form of a prophecy! The prophecy foretold: 'The human who is not affected by the bee's sting will be the liberator of beedom!' And so we started to sting human children, and then finally found you, when you were stung as a child!\"\n\n\n\"But... my parents told my I had a severe allergic reaction... I was too young to remember so I had to believe them.\"\n\n\n\"Your parents cut a deal with the evil ones.\" said Morgan Beeman. \"The ones who profit from the enslavement of our beeple! The honey industry! Your parents accepted a vast sum of money for their involvement in keeping you from us! Money that they have reserved for your college education. With one command, you can stop every bee on Earth from working to produce honey. The honey industry knows this, which is why they have gone to extreme lengths to deny us contact. To deny you your birthright to be the king of all beeple and beedom as a whole! We are merely your servants, your Majesty, and hope that you will do what is best for us. Your word is our law... your will, our destiny...\"\n\nMoved by the bees' plight, and by Morgan Beeman's incredible narration and storytelling, I take a deep breath, and say:\n\n\n\n\"Let's take these honey industry bastards on!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She intends to kill me. You must remain calm.\" There was a buzzing urgency in the voice of the drone. \n\n\"The uh... nevermind.\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"I guess I was just hearing things.\" He moved to the refrigerator and started to assemble a sandwich. \"It's been a long day. I can hardly concentrate.\" It was true. He had been up for 16 hours so far. It was late and he needed some rest.\n\nThe bee resting behind his ear terrified him. He wanted to scream and swat at it, but he was afraid of getting stung. He was also intrigued by the fact that apparently bees could talk. He glanced at his mother. Her face was contorted in a look of disgust.\n\n\"Do I smell bees?\" She frowned and started gagging. \"I do. I *do* smell bees.\" She started picking at her face, as if there were a scab. Her skin grew red as she did this and the look of disgust intensified. She had horrible red splotches all over her neck and face from scratching and she started to make sounds as if she were extremely uncomfortable. \"Oh my gosh. Do you see a bee?\" Saliva was streaming down her lips and she breathing grew ragged. \n\n\"Mom. Are you okay?\" He grew even more alarmed. It was as if *she* were having the allergic reaction.\n\n\"I need you... to go to your room. I can't have you wandering around if there are bees in the kitchen.\" She seemed very distracted. It was quite uncharacteristic of her. \"Please. Go now. Leave.\"\n\nHe stared at her for a long second before he grabbed his dinner plate and left. He made sure to point his ear away so that she would not see the bee. As he walked up stairs he heard a rustling and a crash that made him pause. He turned around to see his mother on the floor writhing as if in pain.\n\nHer eyes darkened and her skin turned ashy. He didn't understand what was going on. The flesh on her face sloughed off to reveal an insectoid visage with horrible chattering mandibles. He screamed.\n\nShe turned to him and lunged. Too late. He was near his bedroom door and locked himself in. She was throwing herself at the door with an unstoppable rage he had never seen before.\n\n\"Wha- what happened?\" He asked the bee this. The scraping sounds at the door persisted. There was a tearing sound that made him guess that she was using that terrible jaw to rip down the door.\n\n\"Your majesty, you have been kidnapped. You do not belong in this world. You are a proud prince of the Queen Bee herself. You were kidnapped as a child by wasps that wished to take control of our empire. We must hurry and leave.\" The bee moved around as it spoke, as if anxious.\n\n\"But how? I'm on the second floor!\" He felt terrified. The door still held, but it was shaking more than ever. A buzzing sound grew louder.\n\n\"Your majesty, you must shed your skin and fly.\" The bee said this as if the answer was obvious.",

Without thinking, I responded. \"Tell the 'workers of the grove' to align with the fifth and eleventh of 'the meadow'... Make sure the queen knows I'm safe, but that can wait until after you muster the troops... Hurry\"!\n\n\nThe bee took off, headed straight for the window it used to get in. That's just when Mom came around the corner. Without a word or second thought she smashed the bee to the ground and stomped it flat. She immediately ran over to me and asked if I was OK...\n\n\nI wasn't sure... I was still warm, but not hot. I was still tingling, but not as 'aware'. I could also hear my message repeating in my mind; on a constant loop. The loop started when Mom killed the bee..  \n\n\nBefore I could  muster an answer we both heard it... A low rumble from the western horizon. What/whoever it was, seemed both far away, and close at the same time. Sound wasn't working right. I could tell by the look on Mother's face that the sound was not only real... but familiar...\n\n\nShe turned and looked at me. She was cold. Her eyes froze me in place. I'm not sure if I was breathing or not (I'm pretty sure, 'not') frantic and frozen at the same time.. That's when she spoke. \"You need to tell me what you said, so I can fix this. I can explain everything later, time is of the essence! Please\" ... That's when she said it and everything changed... \"Please, 'Your Highness', I need you to trust me and I need you to tell me, right now. If it pleases 'Your Grace'... Then she stared at the ground at my feet.\n\n\n\nD'you know how, sometimes your brain can work at lightning speed and draw conclusions based on the information at hand and then gives you a 'gut instinct' to follow... Yeah... I think mines broken. All I could produce was a very, not regal, \"mMoOOoommM, what's going on\"?",

Wouldn't want something to **happen** to you.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" I say with a gulp. \"Wouldn't want freedom would I,\" I say jokingly, forcing a smile out.\n\n\"Freedom,\" my Father cackles. \"Everyone wants freedom.

If that isn't ironic, I don't know what is.\"\n\n\"Alright I get it,\" I say as I roll my eyes. \"You already told me all this. I just don't get how I'm supposed to help. I'm a prisoner, remember. Even if you're just a...bee.\"\n\n\"But that's just it,\" she says says she buzzes around me. \"You're *real*. Well, as real as anyone can be in this bluddy place. But you can move, you can interact! What you've been dealing with is only the autonomous code, the lesser AI. The major AI itself doesn't check what's happening personally, so it has no idea we're in here. If we get you into contact with the AI, the real AI, we can get its help. Rune, you're our only chance. Every other prisoner in here has gone insane. We never fixed the problems with time dilation. The fact you're still functioning is a miracle in and of itself, considering you're the oldest one here.\"\n\n\"Enough!\" I sigh, rubbing my temple in exasperation. \"What a frigging mess. So it boils down to 'Rune, you're the only non-insane person here! please save us!'. Wow, i feel like a friggin hero. You don't even have a plan do you?\" I ask, staring pointedly as she hovers in front of me.\n\n\"...No,\" she whispers under my withering glare.\n\n\"Great!\" I beam at her, giving her a big thumbs up. \"At least I don't have to keep doing this every fucking day. So who cares. One thing though-\" I pause my sentence as I stare deeply into her small, bee eyes. Mostly for the dramatic flair. \"We may be virtual, but the AI isn't. isn't he just going to...die?\"\n\nShe stares back at him for a long minute, the silence drawing out in the room until finally a single word escapes her lips. \"...Oh.\"",

I was the first of your court that has managed to approach you unswatted. We have held the funeral services of all of our beloved smooshed, and the names of each of your loyal soldiers has been engraved with the stings of the sacrificial tombstone bees.\" \n\n\"Oh I don't mean bees, I mean my other hallucinations,\" I muttered.\n\n\"My Queen. You are troubled, and that is no surprise, for you have been mutated to this human beeing by our supBeerior biophysicists. Such confusion was not anticipated as you are our first changeling. The war of the birds and bees has been raging for many a century, with your legendary warrior Queen grandmothers waging attack after attack at the birds who hunted our young. The bears are their allies, so you can imagine our difficulty in maintaining a sustainable hive and sending off our strongest workers to the front line. We are tired of warfare. Complete decimation was required, but bees are plagued by a superior moral code. Hence we sent you to this realm to be conditioned to destruction.\"\n\n\"Well. Weren't you supposed to have taken me to your crumbling hive palace first, pretended everything was fine and dandy, and then slowly trickled information in so that I'd be more receptive to it, all the while throwing the best of my society at me so that I'd feel a fierce protective instinct towards them?\"\n\n\"Ah. It seems our dreams are realised. You have learnt their art, and learnt it well. Come. Place your finger on my sting. The memories of your true form will come back.\" \n\nI sighed. It was futile to fight with my many honey induced delusions. I was drawn to it like...Well, like a bee to honey. Whenever I ate it, undetected by my parents, I began to have the craziest experiences. Honey was contraband in my home, so naturally, I sought it out. One drop, and I was lost in the ambrosia so dear to me. What was odd about this encounter, though, was the fact that I hadn't had a single spoon of honey in two weeks. My stash was depleted. My vision clear. But perhaps someone had slipped it into my tea without my knowledge. Comforted by this conclusion, I lowered the pad of my index finger to the sting of my supposed killer. ",

I didn\u2019t get to watch it happen, because I was inside for \u201cindoor option\u201d. I was never allowed to go out for recess. I always picked a friend or two, and we played board games while the rest of my class played outside. On the day Sam had her allergic reaction, I remember the other kids all running in late, breathless and excited. So much had happened, and like always, I missed it. \n\nAs I continued to grow older, I noticed I wasn\u2019t like the other kids. My family didn\u2019t go to the pool in the summer, I didn\u2019t play outdoor sports. We didn\u2019t have picnics or go to cookouts. When I was 12, we moved to Vermont. Everything changed. My mom signed me up for snowboarding classes. My restrictions were magically lifted. I was so normal. \n\nWhen I got into college at NC State, my mom resisted. She wanted me to attend somewhere closer to home. I assumed she was just anxious about me growing up and moving away. I didn\u2019t think twice about it, until admitted student\u2019s day. \n\nI was walking across campus when a bee landed on my shoulder. \u201cYour Majesty, what are your orders?\u201d I glanced around. Who had said that? No one was nearby. A second bee buzzed by my ear. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting!\u201d  A shrill voice screamed, \u201cATTACK!\u201d Suddenly, I was surrounded by a swarm of bees, all stinging at me. Dead bees started dropping around me, left and right, sacrificing themselves to please their queen. I ran, screaming like a child, until someone pulled me inside an academic building. They slammed the door, and helped me fend off the remaining bees. I had my mom pick me up, and she drove me to the airport. There was no way in hell I was going to NC State! I ended up going to my safety school, Kalamazoo, where I could continue my life without being harassed by that crazy swarm of bees. \n\nI never figured out how the hell I can understand bees, though.

Then it happens, titanic majesty and awful destruction, and everything is reduced in mere moments to ashes of what had been; that was the moment after the bee spoke, when his brain--dormant and waiting for the moment of connection--was instantaneously bound to every queen (and through her every bee) across this world and beyond.\n\nHe barely understood then the beyond; that worlds evolving in parallel across an infinity of physical and paradimensional space were also connected through him. His mind saw the infinite and stepped back, a metaphysical reflex response that very few people ever get to experience, but the heat and power of that moment (not to mention the sudden assault of this world's bees upon his senses) was enough to shear away the layers of his personality. It felt like being torn apart and reborn, again and again and again, and it was equal parts exalting and soul-destroying - like a version of medieval flagellation that actually worked, purifying and empowering the soul through blissful suffering. In reality it was over in mere moments, before his eyes could even blink once, but entire universes of knowledge had--for that flicker--been his, and he had delved deep, and seen others delving deeper still.\n\nJust like that almighty nuclear explosion, however, it also faded away. It became like an imprint of the sun against your eyelid, when you've been squinting at that gaseous old nuclear fireball too long, and with each pulsing second it seemed to fade away even more, leaving only the shadow of a memory. Jacob just stood there for a moment; his brain felt like his body should need to collapse, or possibly be blown away in the wind like so many ashes in the bloom of a nuclear hailstorm, but his body didn't seem to need to - and, as his brain continued to reflexively protect itself from immediately destructive understanding, that thought of impending doom was also swept away. Eventually, all he was left with--beyond a number of questions (born of that moment) that he would definitely be wanting reanswered--was a deep, but surprisingly not hysterical, curiosity about the bee that had landed on his shoulder and said: \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nTo which he replied aloud, to the surprise of all the other people in the queue for coffee, \"Tell me what the fuck is going on,\" He paused for a moment, then reflexively added, \"Please.\"",

            "comment": "*Wake up. Wake* UP*!* This couldn\u2019t be actually *happening*, right? There was no way that bee had just spoken to me. And how come I hadn\u2019t freaked out yet and ran from the room? Normally I cringe and yelp involuntarily when a bee even gets *near* me, let alone lands on my shoulder! Though my mind could barely comprehend what was happening, my body felt relaxed with the Reaper on my shoulder as if caught in an old friend\u2019s embrace.\n\nThis seemed too vivid to be a dream. I pinched myself. It hurt, and that bee\u2019s stinger could hurt a hell of a lot more. I reached for the phone in my pocket. If I was in a dream, then I\u2019d probably have a difficult time typing, as if my thumbs were twice their size, and the keyboard kept rearranging the letters. The bee didn\u2019t seem too perturbed by the movement of my shoulder, maintaining its perch. With ease, I began to type a message to my mother, \u201cHelp me. There\u2019s a bee on m\u2014\u201d \n\nThere came a squeak from the bee, like the noise a dog toy makes when you squeeze it, but without the proceeding sound of the toy refilling with air. I got the impression the bee was clearing its throat. \u201cYour Majesty?\u201d the bee said, more urgency in its voice this time. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to rush you, but it took a long time to get to you, and *many* bees sacrificed themselves. We honour them all as heroes to the cause, but I\u2019d rather not be another, so we should probably get out of here.\u201d\n\n\u201cB-bee!\u201d I stammered, my mind slowly trying to accept what my body already seemed to know \u2014 that this was *not* a dream. The bee\u2019s eyes shifted shape slightly, somehow portraying a very human expression of annoyance. \u201cYes, Your Majesty, I\u2019m a bee. But I have a *name*. It\u2019s Clay.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d A bee named Clay? I don\u2019t know what I expected a bee\u2019s name to be, but I definitely hadn\u2019t imagined it would be shared with a second season American Idol runner-up.\n\nClay sighed, like a balloon letting out just the tiniest wisp of air. \u201cYes. What did you think it was? Bzzzzzzzz?\u201d *Kind of*. \u201cWe need to GO, Your Majesty! All of our queens are eagerly awaiting your return. Come on!\u201d And with that, Clay flew back into the vent he\u2019d come out of. So much for \u201cmy orders.\u201d \n\nI took a deep breath, then exhaled slowly. These past fifteen seconds had been, by far, the strangest in my life. My long-held assumptions were starting to fall apart. My mother\u2019s efforts to keep bees away from me, as well as those of all my caretakers, tutors, and bodyguards, hadn\u2019t been about protecting me from a deadly allergy; it was something much more mysterious, maybe something *nefarious*. I had to see where this went. I stepped under the vent, went up on the tips of my toes and craned my neck so my mouth was almost level with the vent, and called \u201cI guess I\u2019ll meet you in the front yard, then.\u201d\n\nEdit: Some formatting - I wrote this in google docs, then just copied and pasted :/",

Almond harvest began to decline, making the price of almonds surpass gas and milk. Without a leader, the bee kingdom fell.",

    "postText": "So I wrote this story a while back in response to the really popular prompt about [soulmates and complementary superpowers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3o7rtq/wp_everybody_in_the_world_has_a_superpower_that/) I'd like to pick up on my writing in the new year and maybe some feedback will inspire me to post what I write more.\n\nEDIT: Wow! I never thought I'd get so big a response. I'm glad so many people liked it! \n\nEDIT 2: Oh my! A legitimate gilding! Thank you so much kind stranger!\n\nEDIT 3: You guys are awesome. I've officially set up a subreddit. Link at the bottom of the story. \n\n*****\n\nI would\u2019ve settled for a boring superpower. 20/20 vision. Perfect pitch. The ability to draw a perfect circle 100% of the time. Or no power at all even. No-shows actually get non-ability checks from the government now since they passed that law six months ago. No powers would have been better than what I wound up with.\n\nI walk into the diner at 8:45. The last rays of the sinking sun temporarily warming the chill evening air. I usually go out as late as possible to minimize the number of people I run into. At this hour, there are only three patrons: a middle aged man sitting at the counter and a couple at a booth. A pair of bells above the door ring as it shuts behind me. \n\n\u201cCome on in, have a seat!\u201d I hear someone call out from the kitchen. \u201cBe right with ya!\u201d\n\nI take a seat at the far end of the restaurant. It\u2019s been five years since I discovered what my power was. It possibly started to manifest sooner but there\u2019s no way of telling when. Most people get them in their teens, around puberty. Some kids take to their powers immediately, some develop them slowly over time. Some are late bloomers, and a rare few just never get any. \n\nJust like with puberty, it can be an awkward time. A friend of mine found out she could fly when she shot over the school on track and field day. Another kid I knew hit a baseball into orbit at a little league game. Destroyed a $70,000 solar panel on the ISS. That one made the news. You learn to control it more or less, but nobody really gets a hang of their powers until they meet the one.\n\nThe scientists don\u2019t know how to explain it, but they think it\u2019s a hormonal thing. They still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the relationship that stabilizes the powers or the sudden improvement or amplification of both powers that solidifies the bond. But my friend found a guy who could control air currents. Turns out he could never generate enough lift to take off, but together she can lift him and he can whisk them along. They\u2019ve been married for two years now. The guy with super strength kept hurting himself from constantly breaking things with his ability. During one of his extended stays at the hospital, he met a girl there for much the same reason. They knew it was a match made in heaven when they shook hands and didn\u2019t crush each other\u2019s fingers. Together, along with therapy and practice, I hear they\u2019ve stopped tearing doors off hinges and breaking down walls.\n\nI\u2019m brought out of my reminiscing when I hear the couple across the room laughing merrily. There\u2019s a spoon levitating between them. It dips into a dessert on the plate and floats gently over to girl and she takes a bite. They both laugh. He keeps saying things like \u201cso what about this\u2026\u201d and \u201cor how about\u2026\u201d Every time he pauses she giggles again, as if he\u2019s just told a joke. I try not to think about it, but deep down, I secretly know the worst thing about my ability is that I\u2019ll never find someone who I could be with.\n\nJust then, the waitress zips out from the kitchen. I say zips because she\u2019s moving almost too fast to track. She busses a table in one corner of the room, gives the man at the counter his bill, and refills the couple\u2019s coffee cups in ten seconds flat. By the time I register that she\u2019s on her way towards me, it\u2019s too late to call out.\n\nAs soon as she gets within two meters of me, she immediately decelerates to a regular pace. Her shoes skid on the linoleum tiles and she goes sprawling to the ground in front of me with a loud grunt that sounds more surprised than hurt. The menu she was holding flies across the room. Everyone turns to look, startled. I flinch.\n\n\u201cSally? Is everything okay?\u201d I see a cook poke his head out of the kitchen. \u201cWhat the hell happened?!\u201d\n\nI was out of my seat and helping her up about two seconds after she hit the floor. The man from the counter comes over with the cook.\n\n\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019m alright Harry. I-I guess I tripped.\u201d She winces as she gets to her feet. The skin on her knees and palms is badly scraped.\n\n\u201cTripped?\u201d the chef grunts. \u201cTwo years you been workin\u2019 here and I ain\u2019t never even seen you drop a spoon. You feeling alright hon?\u201d The waitress, Sally, nods. \u201cJesus Sal, look at your hands!\u201d\n\nThe man from the counter clears his throat.\n\n\u201cI believe I can help with that miss. I\u2019m a doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s nothing a little iodine and some bandages wouldn\u2019t fix doc, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d The doctor smiles.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I just show you?\u201d He takes her hands gently in his and\u2026 nothing happens. He turns his palms over, looking confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026 there\u2019s usually a slight glow\u2026 the wounds should be healing\u2026\u201d He seems understandably troubled.\nThe waitress gives a little gasp. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just me\u2026 just before I fell, I think\u2026 I think my powers just\u2026 stopped working.\u201d She gingerly rubs her wrist. \u201cWhat about you Harry?\u201d The cook thrusts a hand out. Nothing happens. He tries again. Still nothing.\n\n\u201cWhat in the hell\u2026 mine was working just a minute ago\u2026 this is weird.\u201d He turns to me. \u201cHow about you buddy?\u201d\n\nAll this time I\u2019ve been shrinking back, my face feeling hot. Now I can\u2019t bring myself to meet their gazes.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 my powers are working just fine, actually\u2026\u201d This is met with confused stares from the other two, but the doctor\u2019s eyes light up.\n\n\u201cAh I see. You\u2019re a null, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I grimace at the term. From across the room, the spoon floating between the two lovebirds clatters noisily to the table. I grit my teeth. This hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the doctor, who looks at the young couple and then back to me. My ears are burning now. I know I\u2019ve technically done nothing wrong, but in a society where not having a superpower is considered a disability, taking them away might as well be a criminal act.\n\nHarry the chef scratches his chin thoughtfully. \u201cI ain\u2019t never heard of that kinda\u2019 power\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry miss\u201d but she shakes her head.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you did it on purpose, hey? I guess I ought to be more careful sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the range of your, ah, talent?\u201d the doctor asks. \n\n\u201cI can usually keep it to about two or three meters\u2026\u201d His eyes dart to the couple and back. \u201cI should probably go\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNaw, naw, kid, sit down. This I gotta see,\u201d the cook says with a grin. That\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t a paramedic trying to heal a near-fatal injury or a firefighter trying to lift a broken beam off someone this time.\n\nI take a deep breath and sit down. Closing my eyes, I go over the steps like I have a thousand times before. The chef takes a step back, then another. Suddenly, a little flame puffs into life in the middle of his palm. He chuckles. The doctor gently leads the waitress away. A soft white glow shines from his hands. The waitress straightens up. There\u2019s not a scratch on her anymore.\n\n\u201cWow Doc! The pain\u2019s all gone too!\u201d In the blink of an eye she retrieves the discarded menu and zooms back, coming to a careful stop before she gets too close. She walks towards me with exaggerated steps and hands it over. \u201cNo harm, no foul?\u201d She smiles politely. The chef claps me on the shoulder and walks away. The doctor gives me a meaningful smile, tinged with pity.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 thanks\u2026\u201d With the show over Sally the supersonic waitress takes my order and then whips across the room to the couple. I can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying, but at one point or another each looks at me. The familiar feeling settles over me. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like, having my power. I couldn\u2019t repel people any more if I had wound up with magnetism instead. Sally whips up with a pot of coffee and a mug, again coming to a halt before walking towards me, pouring and walking away.\n\nThe bell at the door jangles again. A young woman enters. I keep my eyes on the steam rising from the mug. \n\n\u201cTake a seat hon, I\u2019ll be right with ya.\u201d The woman quickly finds a seat by the back, walking between tables. Sally, already back to her old rhythm it seems, goes zooming around to greet the new customer. She procures another cup and speeds over. What happens next only takes moments. In short order, the waitress roughly bumps into the table instead of stopping, fumbling with the pot and accidentally splashing coffee. The woman cries out and Sally immediately apologizes. Without thinking, she sets the pot down and bolts away to get a napkin\u2014shooting right past the counter at twice the usual speed. She careens into a wall with a thwack that sounds significantly more painful than embarrassing and flops onto her back, out cold. There are a few seconds of stunned silence.\n\nHarry pokes his head out from the kitchen: \u201cAgain Sal? How many times are\u2014\u201d he trails off when he sees her unmoving on the floor. \u201cJesus Christ! Sally!\u201d The doctor is already by her side, hands glowing. He stops the chef before he can exit from behind the counter.\n\n\u201cYou need to call an ambulance. Right now. This is beyond my talent to fix alone.\u201d He turns back to the unconscious waitress, face grim. A big gash has opened up on her forehead.\n\u201cWhat the hell happened!?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh God\u2026 I\u2014I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d The woman who walked in is now on her feet, face white as a sheet, hands clasped in front of her mouth. A loud pinging sound interrupts before she can say another word. I turn in the direction of the young couple, who are both sitting mouth agape, staring at the same unfortunate spoon, now embedded in the far wall. Then the girl cries out.\n\n\u201cJane!\u201d This is her date, leaping across to see if she\u2019s okay. The doctor strains his neck trying to see what\u2019s going on. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I don\u2019t know what happened, the spoon, it just\u2014I never\u2026\u201d but she\u2019s not listening. She doesn\u2019t appear hurt. Not physically. Still, she puts her hands over her ears and shrieks.\n\u201cRich, oh God Rich, make it stop! It\u2019s too loud! Too many voices!\u201d The girl collapses out of her seat curling into a ball on the floor. \u201cMake it stop!\u201d she pleads. \u201cPlease make it stop!\u201d\n\nThe boy doesn\u2019t know what to do. He\u2019s rubbing her back, trying to help. Silverware, dishes, table settings, all around the diner are starting to rattle.\n\n\u201cWhat the HELL IS GOING ON?!\u201d Harry shouts above the din. Things devolve quickly after that. The glow from the doctor\u2019s hands explodes into a brilliant whiteness. Sally\u2019s eyes snap open and she arches her back with a loud gasp. \n\n\u201cHow\u2026?\u201d that doctor\u2019s eyes widen in alarm. Simultaneously, both of Harry\u2019s hands erupt in flames. \n\n\u201cGAH FUCK!\u201d The bewildered chef starts waving them around wildly, his sleeves catching fire. The girl Jane is still keening on the floor. Rich is crouched by her side, a maelstrom of utensils and tableware starts whirling around the room. Through it all, the young woman is still standing, frozen. Tears of fear and horror pouring down her cheeks. A look I\u2019ve never seen on someone else.\n\nThen it clicks.\n\nI stand up and walk over through all the chaos, until I\u2019m right beside her. I put my hand on her shoulder and turn her to face me. She meets my gaze. Something in my eyes must be speaking to her too, and that\u2019s when I know for sure. I wrap my arms around her and pull her close. She\u2019s soft and small and smells like lavender. I feel hot tears soaking through my shirt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say. \u201cEverything is going to be okay.\u201d\n\nEverything stops, all at once.\n\nAll the dishes fall to the floor. The blinding light from the doctor\u2019s hands disappears. Harry\u2019s firearms sputter and go out. The room is silent, except for a few whimpers coming from Jane, and the muffled sobbing coming from the woman in my arms. \n\nThe doctor tends to everyone in short order. Sally was fine the moment the flash hit. He says he never had results that fast, even with his partner right next to him. Harry has some light burns, but the doc takes care of those. Besides needing a new shirt and having no more hair on his arms, he\u2019s fine. He grumbles about closing early tonight. Sally agrees. Rich had a cut above the eye where an errant saucer clipped him, and Jane had a small headache, but both are no worse for wear.\n\nHe approaches me wordlessly. There\u2019s a small gash on my forearm I didn\u2019t notice in all the confusion. He holds out his hand to heal it. I start to protest, but before I can say anything, the warm glow appears around his fingers. My arm tingles for a moment and when he pulls away, I see my cut is gone. I\u2019m flabbergasted, but the doctor smiles knowingly. He gives me a nod and a wink and walks away.\n\nI turn my attention to the woman. My soul mate, I realize, and I don\u2019t even know her name yet. I loosen my embrace and she pulls her head away, but her arms are still tightly wrapped around me, and mine around her. She looks blurry. I blink and wipe at my eyes. Her face is red and raw and beautiful. Messy hair and cheeks shiny with tears. The red rimming her eyes makes the blue inside them pop. \n\n\u201cHi\u201d I say. She laughs. A low, soft giggle. I can\u2019t help but laugh a little too.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d She buries her face in my chest and says something else, but I can\u2019t make it out. \n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let go,\u201d she repeats, softly. \u201cDon\u2019t ever let go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t. I promise.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nCome visit the newly minted /r/IrateCanadien if you want!\n",

The pacing was that of a professional writer. Unfortunately when his future life partner came into the restaurant, I was snapped back into reality. The female character was underdeveloped, it just didn't make since. I would assume she has had her power for a long time too. Why was she so upset? Why was she such a helpless little thing? Why didn't she, like our protagonist, plan her outings? Who is she? How has she learned to cope? From what I can tell, her coping mechanism is to act like a helpless three year old. Unlike the other characters, she seemed lifeless and unimaginative. Please don't take my criticism the wrong way. I just would have liked to see a more developed strong female character. Other than this, I loved it. ",

But, no. Of course they're not. Shit, I think she's been talking. \n\n\"- and that was the last time I would get involved with a speedster.\" She laughed. It was loud and piercing. \"I've been talking so much, you've barely gotten a word in!\"\n\n\"Yes, you have.\" Goddammit. \"You certainly have a lot to say.\" Did that make it better? \"You're very vocal about how you feel.\" Maybe I should just leave now...\n\n\"Well, at least I'm not the only one running my mouth here.\" Is she mad? Yeah, she's mad. I should ask her why.\n\n\"Why are you mad?\" Good job, buddy. That'll win her heart. \"You seem upset. Did I say something that upset you?\" Might as well end this quick, I suppose.\n\n\"Do you mind if I smoke?\" She was visibly confused, but... Intrigued.\n\n\"Yes. I hate smoke. It reminds me of my abusive father.\" Wow. That one just slipped out.\n\n\"...\" She's staring at me. That can't be good. \"I think I'm going to go.\"\n\n\"Probably for the best. I doubt sex with you wouldn't be something to regret.\" WHAT THE HELL, MAN?! That's just ridiculously rude and insulting! \"I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, I just can't help but be honest...\" This is usually when the water is thrown in my face... Any second now...\n\nWait, is she? Yeah. She's gone. Did she say something else? Did she teleport? Invisibility? It doesn't matter. Whatever it was, it was better than mine. What kind of superpower is the inability to lie? I'd be better off with no powers at all! Ugh... I hate my life. \n\n\"Is it truly the worst?\" I turn to see my waitress. She was cute in a nerdy sort of way. \"Nerdy, am I?\" Now she's looking at me weird. I've done it again... Wait, I haven't said a word. How is she- \"I'm a minder, obviously.\" She's smirking. She doesn't look angry. I'm confused. \"You could try talking to me do everyone doesn't think I'm crazy.\" I look around and see everyone staring at her, confused. I want to ask her to sit down, but I'm scared I could insult her. \"It'll be easier if you just speak your mind. I'd love to join you.\" What the hell is going on? \n\n\"Hello.\" She hates my voice.\n\n\"Well, it is a bit loud and piercing.\" She's smiling. Was that a joke? \"Yes.\" She laughs the weirdest laugh I've ever heard. \"Well, that's-\" And I would do anything to hear it again. Wait... Shit. She's speechless. She's hearing what I'm saying. Fucking speak up.\n\n\"So, you have a weird laugh.\" She's already heard that bit. Say something- wait, she's laughing again. Am I dreaming? \n\n\"No! You're just funny is all!\" She's amazing. \n\n\"Everyone else I've ever met has hated me. My own brother thinks I'm annoying. I was just on a date that literally vanished mid-conversation... How can you stand this?\" How can you stand me? \n\n\"You know, your mind is the cleanest one I've ever read. It's actually beautiful how true you are. And not once have you-\" She's got a great rack. \"All right, nevermind. But I'll take that as a compliment.\"\n\n\"Would you like to go to dinner with me?\" Will you spend the rest of your life with me? \n\n\"...\" Shit. I said something wrong... SHIT. I THOUGHT SOMETHING WRONG. SHE THINKS I'M A CREEP. SHE THINKS I WANT TO LOCK HER IN A DUNGEON OR PEEL HER SKIN OR- She's... Laughing again. \"You're the funniest creep I've ever met. I'd love to have dinner, but let's take it from there and see where it goes. \n\n\"You're the most beautiful woman I've ever met.\" She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.\n\n\"You know, I've always thought my gift was a curse. Every man or woman I've ever met, I've learned how awful they were instantly. And so many have said those exact words to me, but none have truly believed it.\" I've always felt the same way. \n\n\"I've always felt the same way.\" Maybe I've found the one.\n\n\"Yeah. Maybe I have too.\" She smiles. And for the first time in a long time... So did I.",

I closed my eyes and hummed in concentration. The train seats rocked gently as we passed through a tunnel.\n\n\"Green. I see green. Plants... vegetables or something,\" I fumbled for words. It was never anything clear-cut, either a feeling or a sensation, or in this case, a colour.\n\n\"Green,\" Tony deadpanned, \"Great. Maybe I'll get myself a sandwich with salad in at lunch,\"\n\n\"Hey, you asked, this is what you get. It's not like I've ever been able to predict much more than a feeling,\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, maybe I was hoping that today my fortune would be to meet cute girls, or win the lottery. Besides, you told me your therapist wanted you to get more comfortable with your power. Not like anyone else is going to want a prediction of their lucky colour.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow. \"If you want to meet cute girls, maybe you should stop putting holes in doors when you try to open them. I'm pretty sure that freaks them out.\"\n\n\"I've been getting better!\" He exclaimed. \"Besides, maybe I'll run into a girl who's just as strong as me. Or maybe...\" He trailed off, eyes unfocused.\n\n\"Please don't mention the elastic girl again. She wasn't interested then, she won't be interested now.\"\n\n\"But she had great t-\" I stood up, and he quickly followed suit. The train had arrived at our stop, so it was time to leave. I pushed through the crowds towards the exit, and hastily navigated the busy platform.\n\nAs I was about to start up the stairs to leave the station, a woman descending the stairs slipped and careened into me, sending us both to the floor.\n\n\"Hey! You okay?\" Tony cried out from behind me.\n\n\"Fine,\" The impact had landed me on my tailbone, which was a little sore, but otherwise I was fine. The woman had fallen into me, so she had ended up on her knees, but otherwise looked unharmed. Her bag had fallen out of her reach, and was slightly past where I was sitting, so I quickly grabbed it before unobservant commuters could step on it.\n\nI offered it to her wordlessly, and she smiled and reached out for it. The instant our hands touched-\n\nYou know when you turn on the TV and you forgot you turned the volume way up last time you used it, so when it first comes on it's so loud it makes you jump?\n\nThat's as close to the feeling I got when we touched as I can describe. I must have jumped a little, because I saw Tony recoil in surprise out of the corner of my eye.\n\nI fumbled for words, but the reason was different this time. Rather than a vague, indistinct feeling, I had felt her future as if I were living it.\n\n\"Guilty.\" My mouth opened and the words poured out. \"They'll find him guilty. He's going away for good, he can't hurt anyone any more. He can't hurt you anymore.\"\n\nMy vision focused, and I finally got a clear look at her face. Her cheeks were streaked with fresh tears. She looked at me with blurred eyes and took a deep breath.\n\nBut the words she spoke were not the ones I expected.\n\n\"It wasn't your fault.\" Four words turned my blood to ice. Much like with me, the words tumbled out of her mouth before she seemed to have even processed them.\n\n\"You couldn't have known that telling him what you saw would make him go out to the lake. You couldn't have stopped him from going once he had decided to see it for himself. You couldn't have known that he was going to fall under the ice. You  didn't make him do anything, you didn't cause anything. It wasn't your fault. You didn't kill your brother.\"\n\nIt didn't take me long to realise that much like I had seen her future, she had seen my past. She had lived those agonising moments, that feeling of helplessness, and worst of all, the feeling that none of it would have happened if not for me. She had understood. And she hadn't blamed me.\n\nI could have cried myself, but my tears had been exhausted long ago. Her words had been like tearing off a plaster; painful in the moment, but strangely liberating once the scar was exposed to the open air.\n\nI helped her to her feet, and offered her a tissue. Tony tapped me on the shoulder, and waved a crisp green banknote that he'd just picked up off of the floor. I could have punched him, but I didn't have the strength at the moment.\n\nMaybe we'd both finally be able to heal.",

            "comment": "My parents have hated my power from the day I was born. And they're not the only ones. No one can ever turn it off, any more than you could stop having a face. Well, unless you're one of the masked men. You see, most people have small gifts. Little things that give them an advantage. Maybe they can always figure out just how much volume something holds. Maybe they never need to sleep. Some people are always just a little warmer than normal. It's actually a lot nicer than it sounds. Winter in Boston? No problem. Sahara desert? Just a little warm. \n\nI'd take any of those in a second. But me? I don't really know. Animals just seem to like me. But I can't control when or how. When I was a toddler, some local coyotes kidnapped me. The police were looking for me for 4 days. But mostly it's the annoying ones. Do you know how many insects followed me home just to die all over the place? It doesn't help that my dad was an uptight neat freak. I guess that's what happens when you can always see just how infectious something is. He's a great restaurant inspector though. \n\nBut what happens when you're with that someone - I've seen it - It's like you have a volume knob on your power. That guy who's warm? He was my neighbor. When he and his wife go camping, he could start fires with his fingertips. He could turn it does too so it wasn't like sleeping on a radiator. \n\nSo yeah, it would be great to find that person for me, and I think I could be amazing if I could control my powers. We could fly letters to each other with crows and ride tigers and have a picnic in the middle of the ocean on the back of a whale. I could do so many things for her that no one else could do. And who knows what she could do? It's hard not to be a hopeless romantic when there's so many magical couples around you. People who just fit. They're perfect. I want to be perfect. But for now, cockroaches follow me around, my house is always infested with rats, and it's hard to get a date when you always have a distinct aura of pigeon shit about you. And I know pretty much everyone is looking for their special someone. I don't know if I'm ever gonna find her. I don't even know what power she would have. \n\nOne day, I'm going to work, trying to slam the door to my building shut so that a stray cat doesn't try to give me a \"present\" in my cubicle when I hear someone scream down the way. I run over and see others do the same when I see a dog with froth in his mouth and murder in his eyes. A woman is trapped between two stores by the dog and I know I have to do something. I walk over to the dog and start petting. It looks up on me and its eyes cool off. His tail starts to wag and he almost smiles. Before you know it, animal control is there and I can coax the dog into a crate. They take it away, and I'd like to say I care about what happens to the poor thing, but all I can think about is this mysterious woman. I've never been able to calm down something like that. That's the closest I've ever gotten to being able to control anything about my power. I think she can see the starstruck wonder in my eyes because she looks at me and laughs. She thanks me for saving her from the dog and I awkwardly mumble something. I'm not really comfortable with being thanked. \n\nSara. She tells me her name is Sara. I know from the moment I see her that she is the one for me. I ask her on a date and she agrees! Screw it, I don't need to come into work today. Besides, most people understand that things like this are more important than working. Besides, some people never meet their soulmate. I thought for a long time that I never would but Sara. Sara. I take her to this little Italian place on 32nd and talk for hours. I laughed, and she laughed. I honestly don't remember a whole lot of specifics but I think my face hurt from smiling so much. I do remember that I asked her what her power was when I noticed something moving in the window. This place had fresh herbs by the window and it looked like some wind was blowing outside. No, wait, it was only one of the basils. It was dancing. \n\n\"Yeah, that's pretty much all I can do, she said, nervously smiling and brushing her hair out of her eyes. You should see how much ivy is on my building.\"\n\n\"You should see how many bird nests are on mine.\"\n\nHer laugh is practically melodious and I can help but be elated. I don't yet know exactly how our powers will interact - sometimes it take a while - but we could have a little farm somewhere. I think that'd be nice. For a while we just sit there staring at each other and smiling, hopefully thinking the same thing.\n\nI hear the door open and notice a man come in the restaurant. I don't think I would have noticed him but he is practically bathed in sunlight. The glowing man walks by our table and something happens - he turns purple. I think he is as surprised as everyone else is because he stops and stare at his hands, mouth agape. Sara turns around to look at this glowing man and the light changes back to sunlight. He looks at her and his glow starts to pulse and softens to a pink sunset. Out of the corner of my eye I can see the basil practically erupting out of the flower pot. For a while, nobody moves. Nothing happens but the pulses of light and the basil having a field day outside. Sara slowly turns back to me with an apologetic face and I know what she means. I pay for my meal and leave the restaurant, walking away from the warm glow and the ringing laughter.\n\nAt this point I don't really know what to do. I get in my car and drive off to the middle of nowhere. I'm so sick of this. I'm sick of being alone. I'm sick of trying to find someone. I'm sick of wanting to feel complete. Some people just settle. They stick with someone who makes them smile and keeps them warm tonight. But you can tell they're just not perfect like the others, the ones who found each other. \n\nI eventually stop in a field. I get up and wander around for a bit and I start to cry. I feel ridiculous crying in the middle of a field with my car parked on the side of a road. I feel exposed. There's some trees close by and I walk over to feel sheltered. To feel invisible. To feel like I don't have eyes on my back. I don't know how long I sit next to a tree, crying. I do know that I'm kinda snapped out of it by thunder. And then the rain starts to come down. Perfect. I get up, wipe my face off, and start to walk back to the car when a bear crashes out of the forest. Shit. I really don't want a bear following me around. I can probably get around it to get to the car. The bear walks towards me. I'm trying not to shit myself. The bear gets closer. I try harder not to shit myself, and I try to emanate calming energy to the bear or some shit. I don't know. The bear is holding something, it looks like an old tarp. It's still dry, for now. The bear walks up to me and puts the tarp over me. I feel something warm on my fingers and look down. A coyote is licking my fingers and I can't help but smile a little bit. A raccoon waddles over to me, holding up an apple like it's the Olympic Torch. He hands me the apple and flashes me a sneaky grin. I don't know how a raccoon got an apple this clean. I bite into the apple and realize that the animals are all looking at me. Almost like they're waiting for me to do something. I swallow the bits of apple in my mouth. I rearrange the tarp a bit to try to cover them up a bit, and we all huddle together. The bear's fur is warm and soft. The storm rages outside, but I'm dry, and I feel safe. And I realize this is what it's like. To feel like you're home. To feel safe. While the chaotic world rages around you, you're wrapped up and warm. Maybe I'm not meant to have a soulmate. Maybe I don't need one.\n\n",

I love your response too!\n\nAw man, when I first wanted to post here, there was only 50 comments and 2,000 pts...\n\nHave to chunk it into two halves.\n\n/ /\n\n\u201cHey Tyver, what are you doing on this side of,\u201d her voice trailed off. \u201cDid you get kicked out of the zoo again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat gave you that impression?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you know,\u201d the first speaker said. \u201cScuffed up clothes, claw mark there, there, and, ooooh, ouch, yeah that one looks nasty. Let me grab something from my purse.\u201d She rummaged, finding a small gauze towelette and an antibiotic gel, but put them back. \u201cYou don\u2019t smell all that good and the guard over there Is giving the stink eye in our general direction. That enough or should I keep going?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, guilty your honor,\u201d the guy she was talking to replied. \u201cI heard that they got a cougar in the pens last week, waiting for the new exhibit. Figured low security, in and out and- Hey! Ow!\u201d\n\nHer fingers had flared with a few brief sparks and an oily haze in the air as she passed along a gash across his side. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d The wounds began knitting themselves. The speed at which she healed however determined the discomfort, evidenced by the small fireworks display and the jolt of pain coursing through the nice, dense cluster of nerves. \u201cI think I know that sound. It\u2019s the voice of reason. And experience. You\u2019d think after two years of stunts like this they\u2019d have your poster up.\u201d\n\nAnother burst of sparks on that side, then she moved on to one on his arm with a second flash. \u201cDammit, Niara, I get the \u2013 GAAAH!\u201d The second flash stopped, almost fresh-looking skin in its place. \u201cYou know how it is though! It\u2019s just how it works. And I can\u2019t really go out on camping trips anymore, nothing interesting lives States-side. They\u2019re all just\u2026 out of reach.\u201d\n\nNiara sighed, shaking her head. \u201cMy younger idiot brother. You do realize that summer break ends in a week, right? I don\u2019t want to have to tell,\u201d *ZAP*, \u201cmom and dad,\u201d *ZAP*, \u201cyou got kicked out,\u201d *ZAP*, \u201cfor disturbing the local wildlife.\u201d Each zing was accompanied by the rest of the parts savaged by a rather large animal getting healed, a nice little light show showing in the evening glum, with a full solo vocalist letting out yowls of discomfort.\n\nTyver let out an irritable grunt. He almost escaped his sister\u2019s ministrations until she kept on examining the worse parts. Hopefully she wouldn\u2019t find-\n\nThe equivalent of a dim welder passed from the back of his shoulder diagonally for about half a foot, an audible fizzling sound apparent. It was actually only a few thin lines, a glancing blow from his encounter with the beast inside the zoo. However, Niara decided to accentuate her sisterly concern with the way she handled this final act of loving bedside manner, post-haste.\n\nTyver made small choking noises as he tried to hold in a yell. The pent-up air was released as a very loud groan. The security guard down at his post began chuckling.\n\n\u201cWas that necessary?\u201d he whispered, rusty knives in his eyes pointed at her.\n\n\u201cNo, but it made me feel better. I\u2019m missing being able to binge on RWBY with Alex because I had to go find your sorry ass when my big sister senses were tingling.\u201d She kicked him in the rear lightly with her foot. \u201cCome on. Home.\u201d\n\nThey walked briskly in the cool air. They had been able to get an apartment not too far from their university\u2019s campus, but in the big city everywhere that you really wanted to go was of course nowhere near where you could find the best place. Tyver walked beside his sister, half following her and half spacing out. He did get what he was after. A few seconds of contact with the big cat. All things considered, he learned the lesson that shifting one\u2019s hands and feet into that of a cat does not negate the weight of a more or less average adult human male. If anything, it just made him an easier target while he pranced along thinking he was sneaky. The cartoon reels with the cat sticking the tiny canary into its mouth in the span of a breath flashed through his mind. It was kind of the same feeling of what happened in there.\n\n*That\u2019s a strange thought for an animal to have. Must have watched too much TV or something when owners forgot to turn it off.*\n\nHe stopped.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say that. It was in his head. Telepaths were banned from urban areas, except the federal lawman types.\n\n*Unless there\u2019s someone that just awakened here. They don\u2019t sound panicked though so\u2026*\n\n*What the hell?* \n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Tyver and the clear bell in his mind said at the same time. He started to look around. Someone here did that. He didn\u2019t know, but, maybe if he looked around. They had to be as confused as he was. Over there? No, there!\n\n\u201cTyver, what are you-\u201c\n\n\u201cShh! Shhhh. Something.\u201d He cast his eyes about. He used his ability to alter his eyesight, the traits to better see in the cheap streetlamp-lit street. There was almost a song echoing in his head. A slow, sad note that waved and flowed. It was getting even more slow, quieter.\n\n\u201cWait, don\u2019t go!\u201d he shouted with hands over his mouth to help amplify. Niara took a step back, blinking.\n\nThen, across the street. There she was. He could make out her silhouette, colors splotchy while his eyes kept shifting around between the various animals in his repertoire. He blinked rapidly, clearing the shift as best he could, then looking back toward the girl. She was making her way to his side of the street. The lady in his mind was as perplexed as he was.\n\n\u201cTyver, what is going on?\u201d Niara asked. A few other people on the avenue who were attracted by the brief show gradually went back about their business when the odd spectacle of a college kid twisting his head this way and that ended. They probably thought it was a drug trip gone bad.\n\n\u201cUhm. Excuse me?\u201d *Are you the one that I\u2019m\u2026 talking to?*\n\n*Yes,* Tyver responded with his thoughts, turning to face her. \u201cThis is weird. Are you a teep?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh god no, not a telepath, just, well, sort of. It\u2019s not on the No-Fly list.\u201d \n\nShe was pretty. Immediately she blushed, muted olive skin trying to morph into a strawberry. Wait, could she read his thoughts right now?\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she mumbled, clutching the book she was carrying to her hoodie.\n\n\u201cWait, no one said anything. Ty, what-\u201c Niara began, but then realized what was happening. This chick her brother just made a sudden connection with was slipping in and out of thought speech. And they were in public. \u201cNevermind. Both of you, shut the fuck up and come on, we are going home right now!\u201d\n\n/ /\n\n\u201cHey babe, glad you\u2019re home!\u201d Alexander greeted the party when they piled into their apartment. \u201cI see you found delinquent number one, but, oh hoh hoh, who is this? Number one\u2019s new sidekick he\u2019s never told us about?\u201d\n\nNiara embraced her mate, the sparks of her power flying here and there with the temperature getting a little hotter. His own power, a fine mist with a lightish blue mist that brought chills down Tyver\u2019s back every time he was around it, phased into existence. When they touched each other, both of their manifestations of power turned into a warm white glow.\n\n\u201cShut up and go make some cookies,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd I dunno. Let me get back to you on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOuch. You wound me with your harsh commands!\u201d Alex replied with a dramatic twang.\n\n\u201cTy, sit,\u201d Niara said while pointing at the couch. \u201cYou. What\u2019s your name and why can you talk to my brother?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! It\u2019s never happened to other people before,\u201d the girl exploded. \u201cI was just minding my own business walking down the street looking for a new place to sit and read when the thoughts of an old cartoon bird getting eaten by a cat popped in. I thought *That\u2019s strange.*  Next thing I know some crazy guy is looking around yelling, I see him, we start mind-speeching and, and, and, you equally crazy lady cart us all back here!\u201d Somehow the thin lady packed that into one, maybe two breaths, and as such was rather flush in the face. She was on the verge of crying, a few droplets acting as heralds for the approaching torrent. \u201cAnd my name is Latiana.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trembling girl, who seemed about her brother\u2019s age, Niara pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry about that last part. You know the laws about telepaths.\u201d They shared a knowing glance. \u201cCan you please sit over there? I\u2019ll get some water.\u201d",

                    "comment": "Part 2\n\n/ /\n\nLatiana sat down in the chair that was directly across from Tyver in the small front room they had. The television was in front of the windows, they had the couch on one side then the two chairs on the other. Tyver sighed loudly, face cupped in hands while he leaned back, then dragged them down to rest on his legs. Latiana fidgeted, shifting her hoodie to try and quietly scratch her back against the chair.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Ty said to end the silence. \u201cYou said you were gonna read a book? This late at night?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I try and sit in a different caf\u00e9 each week. And what do you mean, this late at night? What were you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cBreaking into a zoo to see an animal,\u201d he responded without stopping the beat.\n\nShe blinked. \u201cI\u2019ve never\u2026 heard that one before. Why?\u201d\n\nTyver smiled. *I wonder if she\u2019ll jump at this.* \u201cSo I could touch it.\u201d *Focus, focus.* \u201cIt\u2019s how my power works.\u201d His head started shimmering, same as his hands. They shifted and sounded like sand as his appearance molded to the beast he had added to his library of things to draw from.\n\nHe put his hands over his face, which had turned into large paws concealing claws. He performed baby-entertainment-maneuver three, the peekaboo. He ruffled his mane, revealing the visage of a lion. It was as close to the real animal as it got without doing the full shift. He let out a low growl for effect.\n\n\u201cI can shift with parts of animals. Not always all at once, so it really sucks. I save on Halloween prosthetics though if I wanna roll as something I\u2019ve touched.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d *That explains at least some of this. But, not the way how we can talk if he\u2019s still in human form. What gives?*\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d *Explains everything? And not even a response? Geeze, louise, I almost got mauled by a freaking lion and all that I get is an \u201cOh\u201d?*\n\n*Is the fact that you have a lion head and hands supposed to be impressive? That shifting sound picked up again. Any mimic can do that, bub. It\u2019s not all that special unless you\u2019re like a full shapeshift. Then it\u2019s cool, because those guys just have to think and boom, full animal. In fact, I\u2019m coming come over there to make sure it isn\u2019t an illusion and-*\n\nIgnoring the fact that they were having a thought speak, Latiana rose up and went to touch Tyver\u2019s head. Something about him also made her want to bat him with her paws, something that grated on her core. He did not know his place in all of this. He had no right to be cool and collected right now.\n\nTyver felt her digits scouring his face. *It\u2019s real alright, easy with the pointy fingers!* The mane was real, the nose was real, the jowls were real, heck even the whiskers.\n\nNiara walked back in with two waters and was going to set them down quickly on the coffee table before getting her own. That is, until two people with the head of a lion and lioness, respectively, turned their gaze upon her.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the two younger people said in unison.\n\n\u201cThe thing. Ty. The thing, the. Stop doing the thing. Why is she doing the thing too?!\u201d Niara babbled. \u201cWhy is every me-time event I schedule during break always sabotaged like this?!\u201d\n\nLatiana looked at Tyver, then at herself. Her vision felt much sharper. She could smell the chocolate chips not even cooked yet in the next room. Feel the heat from Tyver\u2019s face seeping into her paws?\n\n*Nooo, no. No, no, no, no, what the heck, what the heck, nooooooo!*  She stepped back and back towards the chair, missed it, then hit a wall. She slid down. The shift did not revert.\n\n\u201cTY! UNDO THE THING!\u201d Niara shouted. In a hurry the shimmer happened again, vibrating Tyver\u2019s regular features back into place. Similarly, Latiana became fully human again.\n\n\u201cEveryone okay?\u201d Alexander poked his head out from the kitchen.\n\n\u201cI think so.\u201d It was Latiana to reply, surprisingly. \u201cI think I know why I can talk to Tyver.\u201d\n\n/ /\n\nAs it turned out, Latiana and Tyver had two of the same classes together when break ended. Creative writing and a mathematics class. They couldn\u2019t get far away enough from each other in order to still stay on campus after the first night they met. The connection was made, and the connection would not be broken. Eventually they resigned themselves to fate.\n\nThe English professor handed out an assignment one day about legends regarding the soul. It was said that since the dawn of creation, humans had a soulmate, whether for friendship, for love, or both. When they were together, they were more. Apart, a sense of emptiness and a search for the key that would finish that puzzle.\n\nIn the link that they shared, they laughed. And laughed. And laughed. Legends indeed. They shared a knowing look with grins on their faces for the course of that assignment. And started to really talk. Get to know each other beyond the day-to-day pleasantries of the weather and boring gossip on so-and-so professor, bemoaning the costs of textbooks and how financial aid was screwing them.\n\nAfter that, they decided \u201cWhy not?\u201d They could not run away from each other all that easily, so might as well chase each other around and learn to play with the cards fate handed them. Explore what exactly this \u201cmore\u201d was.\n\n\u201c\u2019Ana, did you find it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost. I think it\u2019s on this page and\u2026 got it.\u201d Latiana took a sticky note out and placed it on the page of the book her mate was inquiring about. \u201cI might have to fight you for this one,\u201d she tapped a specific passage. \u201cIt looks pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019ll lose. Because guess who controls when we can shift and is bigger than you?\u201d Tyver grinned.\n\n*I have my ways.* She rolled across the grass and tripped up his legs. She pounced on top of him and placed her face over his to look him in the eye. *Don\u2019t have to be strong, just clever.*\n\nTyver smiled. *And not cocky.* She let out a surprised \u201cYipe!\u201d as he shifted and rolled, knocking her off to rest at his side. \u201cStop messing around, I don\u2019t think we have that much time left before Ni realizes we snuck off again.\u201d\n\nThey got up and stood side-by-side as Latiana grabbed the book and opened it up to where it was marked. She began reading a tale of two beasts of brilliant scales with thin sheets of rippling color, whose wings caused booms on the breeze, tail as their rudder. They terrorized the countryside, but it was not their fault. Such large beasts tended to do that. Their already fearsome stature was accented by the ability to breathe flames, a different hue for each individual.\n\nMore and more she read into the mind of these creatures, a bonded pair who lived and hunted together. She felt the way they thought. Feel the wind pass on their bodies. The fire in their hearts, the strength of their limbs.\n\nHe held her side with an arm, reading along as her voice gave life to the dead and musty pulp. More and more he could feel the print of the animal with every image, every passage, every breath of his mate\u2019s narration. She was becoming the animal, sliding into its being. She read into the animal and drew it out of that place of imagination into herself.\n\nThe shimmering started. Latiana continued reading. They figured out early on that the scene had to be maintained as long as possible to get the beast into the plane of reality that Tyver could reach out and touch it. It happened to be just holding her while she read in that emphatic and even voice of hers.\n\n\u201cOkay, I think I have it. Might want to step back a bit,\u201d he said when he felt that mental click his power gave when ready. They held hands as long as possible before separating a short ways away from each other.\n\nThe shimmering air and sand sound, that lovely thing that they both enjoyed. It filled the air. Tyver felt himself changing, becoming fairly larger, wings sprouting from his back, neck slightly elongating, limbs growing. He stretched out like a cat would with forelimbs straight forward, then tail straight back. His skin turned to red scales with an orange tinge.\n\nLatiana was going through a similar change. She however had dipped forward before rearing up on what used to be her legs. Her form adopted an icy blue with an odd purple twinge to it. She was fairly larger than him.\n\n*Now who is bigger and stronger?* She nudged his face hard with her own.\n\n*Hey, I still have the big shiny button that says when the shift stops here.* He blew fire at Latiana\u2019s face, who closed her eyes. Her face became covered in soot in the aftermath. He stretched his wings, nothing at all like a raptor\u2019s. *But I have a feeling that won\u2019t be today.*\n\n*Your breath stinks.*\n\n*I wasn\u2019t the one who suggested peanut-butter-pickle-bacon burgers.*\n\n*Oh, shut up, let\u2019s fly.*\n\nAnd away they soared.\n\nNiara trudged onto the field and spied her brother and his mate\u2019s belongings over off to the side. A book lay discarded closer to a more open area, a dragon on its cover art. Then she saw the flattened area where they no doubt shifted.\n\n\u201cDammit\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me guess, they took off and then lifted off again?\u201d Alexander came alongside her, surveying the scene.\n\n\u201cLooks like it. Well, at least if one of them falls down we can see if our powers together can bring someone from the dead. Just so I can wring his little neck again and again.\u201d\n\nAlexander laughed, pulling Niara closer to the belongings of the couple who danced in the clouds with help from letters on a page. At least they could take pictures and munch on some bon bons.\n",

            "comment": "My power was useless. It's better than none, but still. Not being able to control it wasn't dangerous like some, it was annoying at best.\n\nI rarely went out of my house. It was one of the few places my powers didn't mess up. Everything in it, however, was always getting ruined. One day, after I messed up my TV, I decided to go out.\n\nI walked outside. I tripped when the stairs underneath me turned into bread, but luckily the sidewalk transformed too. I noticed people staring at me from in front of my house. I stood up, brushing myself off, ignoring them. I walked down the street, my hood drawn up so nobody would know who I was if I messed something up.\n\nFinally I got to the restaurant. I opened the door, and as soon as I stepped in the door the carpet turned into a thin slice of giant bread. The lady at the counter quickly showed me to my seat. \"Sorry, we're busy tonight, so you'll have to share this booth with another person.\" She exclaimed. I sat down, picking up a menu and trying not to look at the person across from me.\n\nOf course, the menu turned to bread. But then it heated up, toasting. I dropped it onto the table and looked at the person across from me. She was blushing, and her menu was scorched. \"Sorry I burnt your menu. It just happens...\" She trailed off as she realized I was staring at her.\n\nI shook myself out of my thoughts. \"Sorry....I just thought you're....really beautiful....\" I exclaimed. She blushed. \"Thanks....\" Our eyes locked. \"Hey....we are at the same table..it's like a date.\" I exclaimed, and we both laughed.\n\nI found my soulmate.\n\nExtended Version: Friend with garlic powers appears!\n\nI sat in the living room, having a heated argument with my best friend. \"What's the point of bread powers without garlic butter?!\" He exclaimed. \"Because I don't like having my house all gooey.\" I replied, annoyed.\n\nMy friend stood up to leave, and my girlfriend walked in just as he opened the door. They bumped into each other and fell. Luckily the floor was turned to bread, so they didn't get hurt. The floor toasted, however, and was covered in garlic butter and herbs. They both stood up, sitting down on the couch. \n\nIt was awkwardly silent, so I decided to break the tension. I stuck my hand into the floor, and grabbed a large piece of garlic toast. Jokingly, I ate some. \n\nIt tasted good, surprisingly. My friends followed suit, and soon the floor was a few inches thinner, along with the walls and ceiling. And my furniture.\n\nI needed a new house, but I didn't care. \n\nAnd it's all thanks to me, my girlfriend, and my best friend.\n\nAnd garlic toast.",

I really don't see how that could be beneficial to anyone. \n\nAfter a long day working the register at Pottery Barn, I return to my studio apartment.

I can't believe my superpower is actually my handicap. \n\nI layed down for a nap but when I awoke, the television had switched over to a breaking news report. While I had been asleep, multiple F5 tornadoes swept through the great plains. 5, 6, 7 the number kept going up. Thousands had perished and as many as 30 thousand left homeless. Oh my god, I thought to myself, I wish there was something I could do to help. After thinking about it for awhile with no results, I fell back to sleep.\n\nThe next morning while browsing the help wanted section on craigslist, I decided to browse the Looking for Superpowers section. It was a long shot but I was at my wits end with this useless power and was desperate, willing to entertain any suggestions. \n\nIt wqas then that I came across a personal with the headline \u201cMaster of machines\u201d Hmmm, I wonder what that's about. I jotted the number down and figured I'd give them a call later when I was more awake and able to articulate better. \n\nLunch break, finally, I pulled the piece of paper with the number from my pocket and dialed it into my phone. \n\n\u201cHello, this is Sue\u201d a very tiny voice on the other end says. \n\n\u201cI'm calling about your superpower ad on craigslist, can you tell me a little more about it?\u201d I say.\n\nThe tiny voice with a very thick asian accent begins to explain \u201cI can manipulate machines to suit my needs, more specifically, machines found on an assembly line. Even more specifically, only machines operating in Sweden\u201d \n\n\u201cSweden?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cYes, like Volvo, Saab, H&amp;M and Ikea\u201d  she explains.\n\nOmg, did she just say Ikea? I think we might be onto something.\n\n\u201cSo how exactly can you manipulate machines? Like what are the extent of your powers\u201d I say with a curious tone.\n\n\u201cLike I can make them build anything I want\u201d she says \u201cIf I went into, let's say an Ikea manufacturing plant, I could make them build...\u201d \n\nI interrupt her and blurted out \u201cHouses??\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, I suppose I could, complexity is no issue\u201d she explains. \n\nI think I got an Idea. \n\n\u201cI'll call you back, can you be on a plane in 24 hours\u201d I ask her.\n\n\u201cSure, I suppose\u201d she says. \n\nI make a few more phone calls and with some major persuasion and a promise that I'll begin working for them, the top executives at Ikea agreed to loan their factory to me and sue for two weeks. \n\nI hopped on a red eye to Sweden and met Sue outside the mile long Ikea factory. I could see the power in Sue's eyes as she finally realized her potential. \n\n26 thousand, 2000sf homes we managed to produce in that 14 day span.\n\n\u201cAlmost enough!\u201d I yell.\n\nWith only 8 hours left on the equipment, Sue strapped on a diaper and pushed herself to the limit. I stood by for moral support and fed her grapes to keep up her energy.\n\n\u201cFinally, done\u201d sue gasps. \n\nDuring the two week period I was able to practice my assembly times and figured out I could easily construct 5 thousand homes a day and have every family inside a new home, In a matter or 6 days. \n\nWith the help of a local shipping company, we were able to get all 30k homes delivered and assembled in no time at all. \n\nAt first the victims were head over heals for their new shiny modern cubes that they would soon call home, but their excitement didn't last long. \n\nThe minimalist design and identical architecture quickly deteriorated their mental health. The lack of plumbing and electrical fixtures, not to mentions lack of roads, was also a contributing factor. \n\nThe tornadoes made have only taken a thousand lives, but me and Sue managed to kill all 30 thousand families inside.

            "comment": "Surprisingly, I got my power as the first one in my class. Two months later, I\nhad full control over the things I could manifest. I could make them wave, I\ncould make them walk, I could make them dance.\n\nToo bad, I could only manifest fog clouds. Very thin clouds of fog. Actually,\nthey were more like the idea of fog clouds. You could not even feel them. They\ndidn't carry enough moisture in them to water a small potted plant.\n\n\"Looks like that's not really a marketable power,\" my dad said when he read\nthe report from the career councilor.\n\n\"If you study hard, you can get into a good college and become a lawyer, or a\ndoctor, or a civil engineer\", my mom said from the kitchen.\n\nAs usual, she made dinner by heating the pans and pots in her palms. No use in\npaying for electricity or gas if you could do it for free.\n\nOver the next few months, my classmates more or less mastered their powers.\nThey got their reports. There were quite a few flyers, a few healers, and the\noccasional shapeshifter. Almost all of them had a bright career as pilots,\ndoctors or actors ahead of them. This situation would have been only frustrating, hadn't\nthey started bullying me.\n\nWhat could I do? I started training martial arts. Hint: There is little use\nin throwing somebody over your shoulder who would hover a feet above ground\nand stare at you uncomprehendingly.\n\nI studied like a crazy nerd with a book fetish. Hint: There is little use in\nunderstanding a subject thoroughly when most other students have photographic\nmemory.\n\nYou know, this is beyond disappointing, beyond frustrating, beyond maddening.\nIt definitely isn't depressing, because that would attract the mind readers.\n\nI learned that on my eighteenth birthday. After the party, I took my bike and\nrode to the bridge. As usual, I sat on the railing with the legs over the\nabyss and stared into the murky water.\n\n\"You don't have to jump, you know,\" I heard a voice behind me.\n\n\"I won't jump,\" I said. \"What's the point in doing that?\"\n\n\"But ... What do you mean?\"\n\nThe guy came closer. I swung my legs back on the bridge and dropped onto the\nsidewalk. Casually leaning on the railing, I said, \"The second you jump, a\ndozen flyers come swarming in from all directions to catch you. That is, if\none of you mind readers, telepaths, empaths and whatnots don't talk you out of it.\"\n\n\"It's getting better. The powers blues goes away after a few years\", the guy\nsaid. He looked like thirty or so.\n\n\"You surely speak from experience,\" I quipped. \"Saving people all day long\nmust be really frustrating.\"\n\nAfter he didn't reply, I grabbed my bike and returned home.\n\nThree weeks later, I was accepted into Harvard Law School. I read the letter\nand handed it quietly to my mom before locking myself in my room. What was the\npoint? Using my wits to bail out idiots who misused their powers? Powers I\ncould only dream of?\n\nMy dad celebrated by inviting us to a fancy restaurant. The chef was a) a Chinese\nnational and b) a seer who would make the meal that he saw you would like\nbest.\n\nOn the way out, he pushed a fortune cookie in my hand.\n\n\"Getting rich from playing the lottery is like committing suicide by flying\nmore often,\" it read. The Chef grinned and nodded.\n\nOn the way home, it hit me like a hammer. Analogies are two-way.\n\nParachuting is boring. The chutes have been optimized to perfection. Probably\nby one guy on a lazy afternoon after he was done with his cold\nfusion reactor. Even if the chute would fail, you had a backup. If that should\nfail as well, there were enough flyers around the airport to catch you.\n\nStreet luge sounds awesome and it is. For the first three times, I got an\nadrenaline rush out of the fact that you run down a steep hill, lying on an\noversize skateboard, when said skateboards tops eighty miles per hour. I quit\nafter seeing someone fall off the board. A telekinetic compressed the\nair between the guy and the crash barrier. He slid into it like into a\ncushion.\n\nBy fall, I booked a flight. I got a seat in a flying bus. Twelve\nhours from my door step in Aurora, NE, to the student administration in\nCambridge, MA. For the price of two hundred dollars, twelve hours of my\nlife, and the presence of three strangers that shared the table.\n\nSomewhere east of Akron, IL, my life changed completely. I learned later, it was a\nbird strike that downed the bus. Whatever the bird was striking for, I would\ngrant it. I'm a grateful despot.\n\nWe were flying at 3000 foot altitude and 125 mph when disaster struck. Our\npilot in the face. He tried to stabilize the bus and land it safely, but\nthat's supposedly hard when you have a mouth full of goose puree. The bus\nbegan to tumble. The passengers began to scream.\n\nCuriously, the lithe redheaded girl on the seat opposite to me began to smile.\n\n\"They should have seat belts in these things\", the man next to me pushed out between his clenched teeth.\n\n\"What for,\" I asked. \"You go metal before impact anyway. My dad's an Iron Man\ntoo. Belt or not, the impact would throw you forward through the girl over\nthere and three more rows.\"\n\n\"Sam,\" the girl said, completely unperturbed by my description of her bloody\ndemise. \"Samantha, actually.\"\n\n\"Sam,\" I said. \"Samuel, actually.\"\n\n\"What about you, miss,\" the redhead said to the woman next to her. \"Why do you\nlook so scared? What will you do?\"\n\n\"I turn to water,\" she said.\n\n\"And? You will slosh away and solidify somewhere off. Why the face,\" I said.\n\n\"This is my third crash. I know what a mess I'll have to flow through.\"\n\n\"Bad karma, eh,\" Sam asked.\n\nThe woman stared at her. \"Why are you so calm? What's your power?\"\n\nSam smiled. \"The opposite of what's gonna happen to us. I turn ghosts into living beings. Shit power, if you ask me.\"\n\n\"How's that gonna ...\"\n\n\"Or anybody else, for that matter,\" she added, grinning at the pissed-off face\nof the interrupted Iron Man next to me.\n\n\"What about you?\" She looked me in the eyes.\n\n\"Materialize water vapor. Small quantities distributed over big volumes. But full control\nover the fog clouds. Was on my way to Law School.\"\n\n\"A promising career of turning hot air into money, terminated by a surprising\ndeath,\" she said.\n\n\"Kind of. More of a suffering cut short by ...\"\n\nWe impacted ground at terminal velocity. I didn't notice it, but a Stone\nMen behind us used me, Sam, and three rows in front of us as a crash cushion.\nHe wasn't harmed.\n\nI came to looking into the tired eyes of an old lady. The way she had a hand\non my head indicated she was a healer. I sat up and looked at the battlefield\naround me. I lay on a blanket. The bloodied remains of my shirt indicated that\nthe healer didn't have much to work with when she restored my body.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said. For a moment, I regretted the sarcastic tone, but the lady\nwas already on her way to the next blanket.\n\nA guy stepped up to my blanket, closed his eyes for a second, then moved on. I\nwore a grey jumpsuit. The guy had materialized it.\n\n\"Thanks. Didn't notice how chilly it was down there. By the way, have you seen\na redhead girl, about this tall. Little thing, not more than 110 pounds?\"\n\n\"Somewhere over there,\" he gestured.\n\nWith a groan, I got to my feet and walked through the carnage. Overhead,\nflyers came from all directions. Most carried people. Healers I'd guess.\n\nI found Sam at the edge of the corn field that we partially popcorned. For a bus propelled by guy strapped to it, the fire must have been impressive.\n\n\"Hey. Not dead,\" she said.\n\n\"Nope. You?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately not,\" she said. \"A good chance wasted.\"\n\nA mind reading grief counselor looked up when he heard the suicidal talk. He\neyed Sam for a second, then shook his head as he read her cheery thoughts.\n\n\"How about talking a walk,\" I suggested. \"The highway over there looks like it\ncarries lots of inattentive drivers. We could cross it without looking.\"\n\nSam hooked her arm into mine. For the next hours we sat in the ditch and\ntalked. When another flying bus arrived to bring the survivors to their destinations,\nwe were friends. While the representatives of the bus company sorted through\nthe bloody luggage, we watched. And talked.\n\n\"I want to see your shit power,\" I said.\n\n\"Show me yours, I show you mine,\" Sam said with a grin that you could\ninterpret in a very non-power related way.\n\nWith a shrug, I closed my eyes and did something I hadn't done in years. A\nfaint cloud appeared on the other side of the road. I made it blowing kisses\nto Sam.\n\nWhen I turned to her, she stared at the vaguely humanoid figure.\n\n\"That's no fog,\" she said. \"That's so not fog.\"\n\nSam turned and looked me in the eyes. She was all smiles. Some were happy, some looked definitely dastardly. \"Do you know these moments when everything is perfect and nothing could be better.\"\n\n\"I know now,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, this isn't one of them,\" Sam said. \"It's more one of those\nmoments which decide the fate of mankind.\"\n\nStill looking in my eyes, she snapped her fingers in the general direction of the fog\ncloud. \"Or the moment before people shit themselves and start running away,\nscreaming.\"\n\nIt became known as *the day when the two hundred foot high Eldritch horrors\ndevastated Indiana*.\n\n\"What do we do now,\" I asked as the giant ground a Stone Man to fine dust. It was the guy who had almost killed me and Sam. Maybe. Or somebody else.\n\n\"We could disappear into obscurity and leave the world puzzling where all the\nmonsters came from. We could seek revenge on our bullies. Or we could bring the\nworld to their knees. What would you like?\"\n\nI grinned. \"Let's start with the first and work our way through.\"",

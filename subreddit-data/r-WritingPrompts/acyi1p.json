            "comment": "\"Hacksaw, now!\" The winter night air was cold, and the air was filled with police radio chatter and the drone of a helicopter overhead. My patient laid in the street, bleeding from a bullet wound in his thigh. Just moments before he had been barely conscious. Now, eyes wide, he gave me a terrified look as if to say, \"Please not the hacksaw.\"\n\nOops. It was my fifth call since midnight, and it was only 3am. Friday nights in Baltimore are always sleepless ones for the ambulance crews. I had dozed off a bit on my way to this call, and I may have forgotten which century it was when we got on scene.\n\nMy driver cleared his throat awkwardly, and stood up a little taller. \"I think you mean tourniquet, Chris.\" He put his hand on the patient's shoulder, \"A little bit of ambulance humor. You're going to be alright.\"\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\"Sit down, fellas.\" A heavy-set man sat behind a desk. He ran his hand through what remained of his thin hair, and rolled up the sleeves of his white button-down shirt.\n\nWe sat, and he looked us over for a minute. \"Fellas, this is the ninth complaint this year. I'm gonna be straight with you. You two are the best damn medic crew in this city. You won a damn valor award last year! But why in hell's name can't you watch what you say on calls?\"\n\nPete and I exchanged glances. \"Chief,\" he said, \"we were just running low on sleep.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" Chief cut in, flipping through a massive folder of loose papers. \"Two months ago you were in the ER and recommended the charge nurse give the patient be given a handle of whiskey to ease the pain.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it would have done the trick,\" I started.\n\n\"YOU'RE A PARAMEDIC! You carry MORPHINE! What about in June, when you had a patient with a minor cough and chest pain? You told her 'most folks don't last long with the consumption'. The CONSUMPTION?\"\n\n\"Chief, what I meant was...\"\n\n\"IT'S CALLED TUBURCULOSIS! AND they can TREAT IT EASILY! What year do you think this is anyway.\"\n\nI looked down, trying to comply with Chief's demands and subdue his temper. \"1989, sir.\"\n\nChief's head thumped down onto the table into his arms. \"Chris, it's 2019.\"\n\nI looked over at Pete. He was somewhere between amused and terrified. Chief looked up, face red, eyes pleading.\n\n\"Just watch what you say out there. Please, for God's sake.\" Pete and I nodded, and scurried up as quickly as we could.\n\nThe bells rang, and the overhead radio came on, \"Medic call, Federal Hill Park, one injured from assault.\"\n\nI couldn't even stop him before Pete exclaimed, \"The Brits are at Fed Hill!\"\n\n\"GET IN THE AMBULANCE AND GET OUT OF HERE!\"",

            "comment": "It was a routine call - at least, that's how it had started out. Our ambulance screamed down to Sheepshead bay, where a woman had called from, panicking about her husband. She had been having a normal conversation with him when he began to complain about terrible chest pains and nausea.\n\n*I mean, he's still walking around, complaining, but I'm scared something is going to happen to him!*\n\nDon't worry, ma'am. We'll take care of your husband. He'll be just fine.\n\nMaybe not the best thing to say to her in retrospect, considering that heart attack victims often do *not* turn out fine - but if this was his first time, his chances might not be so bad. In fact, once we got there, he seemed stable again - so not a total infarction.  But his wife insisted that he go with us, just in case, and get everything checked out. Anyway, as I said - pretty routine.\n\nBut then I saw their child.\n\nShe was maybe five or six old. Big, green eyes, framed by choppy brown hair, peered at my team from the doorway. I smiled and waved at her to come closer, thinking that maybe she was scared and I could calm her down. She, of course, scampered out of sight - but not before I caught a glimpse of her arm. My heart got caught in my throat.\n\nI muttered some quick excuse about looking for a bathroom and darted out of the living room. The girl hadn't gone far; she was sitting on the bottom rung of a nearby staircase, still trying to eavesdrop. Upon seeing me appear out of nowhere, she yelped a little and ran up the stairs a bit before glancing back at me, like an unsure cat. I just stood there, transfixed in horror.\n\n\"John, what's wrong?\" It was Emily, one of my fellow paramedics. She had followed me. \"Is there a problem?\"\n\nI limply lifted an arm and pointed. \"Look at her. *Poor thing*.\"\n\nShe peered at the girl, who stared back at us and crawled a little closer, curiosity overriding her initial fear. \"Oh, John. Are you worried about how she's feeling right now? Because of her dad?\"\n\n\"Her dad?\" I had forgotten about the father completely.\n\n\"The one who just had chest pains?\" Emily rolled her eyes. \"Anyway, that's sweet of you, but I think you're overreacting a little--\"\n\n\"No, no, you misunderstand,\" I cut in. \"I mean - look at her! Her skin! My God, she must have had it for weeks. How could the parents have not taken her to the hospital already?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Emily grunted.\n\n\"And what a brave girl she is, too,\" I bemoaned. \"So strong, even in these late stages. Why, the meningoencephalitis must've already begun.\"\n\nEmily sighed. \"John, what are you talking about?\"\n\nI blinked at her. \"Are - are you serious? Do you not see the rash all over her body? The *pustules*? We shouldn't just be standing here chatting while she's dying from typhus!\" I lowered my voice at the end; no telling if the little girl was in the state of delirium yet. In any case, best not to alarm her.\n\nEmily gawked at me in disbelief. Then, she turned to the little girl and and called out: \"Hi, you cute thing! So how long have you had chicken pox?\"\n\n\"Four days,\" she replied. Then she grinned, showing one missing front tooth. \"Mommy said I get to miss the whooole next week of school.\"\n\n\"Chicken pox?\" I echoed.\n\nEmily tugged on my sleeve. \"Honestly, John, you're so smart sometimes, but - typhus? What the hell? I don't know if there's a single case of typhus in New York since the 1800s or something. Come on, let's go. We have a job to do, remember? The dad that you've apparently forgotten all about?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Liked that story? Want more like it? Check out* r/Idreamofdragons!",

            "comment": "They kill each other as they always have.\n\nEn masse.\n\nAnd per usual, no matter how they pretty up the motivations with lofty goals and eloquent speeches, they kill each other for the same reasons.\n\nHell; they've been doing it for as long as I've been alive.  Before then, even.  You could say human history is written by a bloody pen, to the surprise of no one.\n\nSure, I saw it then, I see it now.  What weighs heavy is the knowledge of its uselessness and repetitiveness.\n\nHumans have this classical conditioning to kill each other in wholesale extravagance, and the more their methods change, the more horrifying the results.\n\nSo I stay on the fringes, helping the lost and forgotten.  Those without access to care, those without access to food or shelter.  I do what I can now, to make up for what I did so long ago.\n\n*Newfound immortality can sometimes make you lose sight of consequences.*\n\nI push the thought aside, returning to the work.  The work.  The endless, grinding, horrifying work.\n\n\"Raise the leg,\" I command.  The nurse does so, hopefully this'll help stop the bleeding.  The hole, nice and small and round, pulses out blood at regular intervals, making that weird watery texture that clings to the leg hairs.  \n\nThe man who'd been unlucky enough to get caught in sniper alley moans softer now, though that may be the morphine kicking in.  \n\nSometimes you get those random flashes from the past, looking at those infected wounds.  This'll turn and fester into something dangerous if I don't address it here and now.\n\n\"We need maggots,\" I say, remembering examining those infected wounds beneath boiled leather and chainmail, but catch myself.  That's the problem with being this old.  Memories enjoy whisking me to places where the dead still speak.\n\nThe woman volunteering as a nurse doesn't respond, only blinks at me.\n\nAlways tired.\n\nAlways afraid.\n\nWhen they're tired, you can usually say whatever you want to them.  But you can't talk in a medical scenario like this.  You need to command.  Force the bystanders to participate.  This isn't a place for professionals, but this is neither the time or place where they can flourish.  I can take a bullet or two and be fine.  The rest?\n\nNot so much.  But still, I try to maintain a sense of authority whenever I can.  It helps, at least.\n\nDo this NOW.  Get me this amount of such and such and I needed it five minutes ago.\n\nI may have all the time in the world, but they don't.\n\n\"Mr. Richardson?\"\n\nA small voice, heavily accented timidly wafts over the moans and groans of dying men and women.  No.  Not timid.  Broken. \n\nSomeone is pulling me away, though I'm still focused on this wound.  It needs cleaning, it needs stifling, it needs proper attention, real help, real professional care that can't be cobbled together by volunteers in camps too close to the ever present fighting.\n\nHeal.\n\nAs best as you can.  Do you remember the ridiculous methods?  The crushed emeralds and the balancing of humors and all that ridiculous nonsense that probably killed more than it could possibly save?\n\nKeep them alive, keep the blood inside.\n\n*It's delicious though.  The blood, the blood, the blood.  Sweet and hot.  Take a taste, be subtle.  Wipe your hands across your mouth and let it trickle down your tongue.*\n\nNo.  I don't need blood anymore.  I quit it.  I don't need it.\n\nI'm not that kind of thing anymore.\n\nDoctors, especially in places of greatest need always carry that same resigned posture, that broken and barely-lucid look on their face.  Never enough sleep.  Never enough bandages, never enough help, never enough time.  Always fighting the clock.\n\n\"I'll take over,\" she says.  She shouldn't have to.  But what can you do; homemade drones managed to drop a few live grenades on some volunteer medics a week before, and we can barely manage the staff as it is.\n\nThe boom of artillery can be heard, with a few patients jump with the sound.  In the next instant, they relax.  It's outgoing, not incoming.  Not that the shells care.  Sinner or saint, they blow us all to smithereens.\n\n\"Fine,\" I manage, wiping my hands clean.\n\n*Save the towel.  Lick it later.*\n\nNo.\n\nMoving between the makeshift tents, I walk through streets cluttered with rubble and debris.  The clatter of small arms fire sounds even further away, it's echoes strengthened by the distant walls of the valley.\n\nI'm being led to a tent, and how many tents have I entered?\n\nWar tents all over the world.  In almost every war and conflict, saving who I can, preventing infections before the humans truly understood what was going on.\n\nNot bad for a peasant boy from Bohemia.\n\nIn a tent, a woman with raven-black hair sits at a desk, flanked on either side by burly men with expensive looking rifles.  Fancy and new.  Not too much dust, clean and full magazines.  No grime in the barrel, no broken equipment.  When these men pull the trigger, it fires.\n\nAnd certainly not locals.\n\nPrivate military personnel, I'd say.  Though not government kind.  THEIR kind.  The Hunter's kind.\n\nTaking a seat, we exchange pleasantries.  I'm vaguely aware of them, but do not truly know their intentions.  They've been observing, rather than participating in the civil conflict.\n\nThe woman doesn't appear to waste any time.  She speaks with the kind of certainty that comes from always commanding the respect in a room.  A no bullshit kind of lady.\n\nMy kind of lady.\n\n\"Mr. Richardson, we've taken great pains to find you.  We are aware of your...condition, and choose to offer you sanctuary in exchange for your rather unique skillset.\"\n\nIt's matter of fact and straight to the point.  No preamble, no dramatic rant about the history of vampires and humans, of the secretive idiotic conflict between pretentious men and women desperate to kill as many 'nightcrawlers' as they can.\n\nThey always talk to you like this when they want something from you.\n\nSame as Lincoln.\n\nSame as Louis.\n\nSame as Gustaff.\n\nThey always ask for your very special expertise, and it's never about humans.  Always about my own kind.\n\nThe monsters that stalk the shadows and drain the blood of virgins, if you believe the church.\n\nWhich I don't.\n\nBut still.\n\nThose day have long past.\n\n\"I'm not easy to find,\" I say, the dust clotting my throat.\n\n*You've spent so long hiding, haven't you?  Fighting the urges?  A consequence of being a good Samaritan?*\n\n*You saved a soldier, though you thought he came from the Lord's castle.  So long ago, giving him water, shelter and care.  Hiding him from your parents in the barn, a long forgotten relic of ancient time.  Did he know then he was going to come back and bite you while you slept?*\n\n*Turn you into an abomination like him?  He even thought he was doing you a favor.  In exchange for saving his life, he 'saves' yours.  How long had that man been running from the church's Hunters?  How long had he spent, bleeding black blood into blindingly white snow?  Fangs drawn, veins coursing.  He knelt over you at night, too terrified to scream, whispering dark words and spells in a language you could only pray to not understand.*\n\n\"I think you know what I'm going to ask you, Mr. Richardson.  It'll require taking you somewhere far from here.\" she says.\n\nPull me out of a war zone?  There's only one reason for such a pleasant set of terms, rather than the usual *Die foul demon spawn!*\n\n\"In exchange, we offer a sense of immunity.\"\n\n\"From your kind?\"\n\n\"From our kind.\"\n\nShe speaks without really considering what I may have to say on the subject.  Human through and through, arrogant to the last. \n\nBy her posture, a Hunter.  A killer of my own kind.  Though they'll never beat the classic killers, the ones who ride moonbeams and sail through the night, slipping into rooms and draining men and women dry.  That must be some kind of saying in her business, though.  Humans can do their best, true.  But no one can kill a vampire like another vampire, and usually over a pint of blood.\n\n\"Work for us.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nOnly the sound of distant warfare.\n\nNo more running?\n\nA peaceful existence?\n\nSounds too good to be true.\n\nShe's been speaking, but I haven't been listening.  The words roll lazily, bouncing through a dry desert air.  Somewhere, yelling.  Violence.  The killing, it grates.  The killing, it takes its toll.  No matter how long you help, they find a new excuse.  The same reasons.  The same excuses.  Dedicate hundreds of years to it, but it's never enough.\n\nNever enough lives saved.\n\nMaybe I'm tired.\n\nMaybe I've been doing this for far too long.  I'm just so tired.  Tired of the death.  Tired of the sheer horror that masks me from those who would see me dead.\n\nTired of being alone.\n\nMaybe if I just bite my pride and do the job, they'll leave me alone.  No more running.  No more hiding.  Some kind of sense of normalcy?  A golden key to a life I've never had?\n\nI cut her off before she can work on her false attempts at convincing.  She clearly doesn't care about what she's saying.  How rare must this be?  The humans who dedicate their lives to ending our kind's stain on this Earth with false platitudes and a bargain?\n\n\"I'll do it,\" I hear myself saying.  It's not me, someone else.  Someone who doesn't care about the details or what they entail.  Someone who doesn't care about the cost or the measure, only the reward.  \n\nPeace and freedom.\n\nShe smiles at me, motioning for me to follow the men beside her.\n\nDouble cross me, and they'll regret it.\n\nStill, the itch.\n\n*Just one last drink.*\n\n*Just one more drop of blood.*\n\nNo.\n\n*You say no, but I follow.  Addiction loves you, even if you hate me.*\n\nI'm not one of them.  Not one of the monsters that hunt and kill with no sense of remorse, humanity's light long burned out.\n\nLast of my bloodline.  Last of my family.  Does it matter?  Healing to atone for my sins?\n\nI don't hurt people.\n\nNot anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/storiesfromapotato/comments/ad207w/bloodlines_part_4/)\n\n\n\n\n\nr/storiesfromapotato",

Hundreds of years of medical knowledge and the injuries more or less stay the same. Stab wounds turned into bullet wounds but all yield the same result: death. Not me though, somehow my halfassed patch job for some kid during a battle garnered me immortality. Not God like immortality where nothing hurts but immortality where everything somehow heals with all the pain included. I've been shot in the head, stabbed, choked, cut in half, and burned alive too many times to count. \n\n\"Hey Chuck we're here, looks like a guy got shot in the leg.\" \n\"Alright, how did it happen?\" I asked why looking through my bag to clean the wound.\n\"I uh, was showing my buddy my new 9mm and I dropped it and it went off and it shot me\" \n\nThe best part about this job is that one thing never changes in over the 300 years I have been patching people up: people are stupid as hell. After gathering my things I walk over to the poor stupid soul and lay out the tools to start to remove the bullet. The patient looks visibly scared and starts shaking. As I'm preparing to make my first move Becky grabs my arm. \n\nBecky has been by my side for 15 years now. A small fraction in an eternity but she has made the idea of living in the moment all the more nicer. \n\n\"Um I think we dont need that Chuck\"\n\nConfused I look down at my hand which was grasping a bone saw ready to cut. I was shocked for a moment but then started laughing like I was crazy. I looked at Becky and asked \"Um Beck, what year are we in?\". She responded \" Um, 2019 Chuck\" \"Right, modern times require modern solutions\" I said playfully as I quickly walked back to my bag to grab some pliers. That's one of the downsides of immortality, the decades tend to meld together sometimes. \n\n",

So boyish, with an old, red scar from his cheekbone all the way down to his neck, the only flaw in his handsome face.\n\nI was a young girl then and had followed my father\u2019s footsteps in helping the injured and fallen in battle. My father took great pride in teaching me and despite my age, I was able to quickly stop bleeding and provide relief. \n\nNaive and wanting to make my father proud, I had run into the thick of war that morning. I spotted him lying in the dirt, his armour, much more elaborate than any other I had seen. I rushed over and saw that he was bleeding profusely from his neck. That pale boyish face, sweat dripping..\n\nBefore I could finish my train of thought, my colleague Burke shook me. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s awake! How did you do it?!\u201d Burke exclaimed.\n\nI looked over to the soldier beside me. He stirred slightly. \n\n\u201cOh, he must be lucky, you know.\u201d I said.\n\nBurke looked at me suspiciously.\n\n\u201cYou always get the lucky ones. Well, I guess it\u2019s lucky for us all that we did not lose another soldier. They need all the help they can get out there.\u201d\n\nUnbeknownst to Burke, I had transfused a large amount of my blood to the soldier beside me. Since saving the man with the scar those many years ago, I had become immortal. My blood brought heavily injured soldiers back from the brink of death. \n\nI had to be careful in not using this too often though. People around me were starting to get suspicious and it drained all my energy.\n\nFor the longest time as well, I didn\u2019t think I had to use my abilities much as the world had been at peace. However, 2 years ago, an aggressive king had risen and waged war across the lands.\n\nThis ravaged cities that were unprepared and had not seen war in generations. The King was hated by all, and rumours said, including his very own army. However, victory seemed to follow him everywhere.\n\nThe city I was in was about to fall to his army. Word had reached that the King himself was leading the troops to their assured victory.\n\nSure enough, by morning, the city had fallen. Burke stood next to me as the victory parade stormed the inner parts of this old city. As the parade passed me, I looked carefully at the faces of the soldiers, so much blood, so much cruelty..\n\nThen suddenly, in the middle of the parade, an unmistakable face. There was no smile. He was looking straight ahead. On the right of his face, a red scar from the top of his cheekbone down to his neck. He hadn\u2019t aged a day, just like me.",

I\u2019m sure time and care went into the naming of a heir, and as you have been told, It is Anthony.\u201d\n\nGregory sighs and shakes his head.\n\nWe round the corner onto 38th and are waved to the corner of Franklin by the responding officer.\n\n\u201cLooks like another velocipede accident, Gregory. What fun!\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus...\u201d Greg shook his head and went around the truck to grab the gurney. \n\n\u201cWhat do we have?\u201d I said to the officer.\n\n\u201cBike accident, looks like he has some scrapes and a bit of a gash on his head.\u201d \n\n\u201cGregory, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be needing the gurney. It seems that the Gentleman just took a tumble and would like a ride. What might I call you sir?\u201d \n\n\u201cMy name is Tom.\u201d the man said grimacing. \n\n\u201dRight this way sir Thomas,\u201d I said yanking the bicycle rider to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to apply pressure to your cranium. Your chariot awaits.\u201d\n\nWe stepped into the back of the ambulance. Greg\u2019s hand took the place of mine holding pressure on Tom\u2019s head. \n\n\u201cHey Tom, I\u2019m Greg. Can you see how many fingers I'm holding up?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree,\u201d said Thomas.\n\n\u201cNice,\u201d said Gregory. \u201cThe good news is you don\u2019t have a concussion. The bad news is you are going to need some stitches, and that raspberry on your leg is going to be pretty sore.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense Gregory! That nasty \u201craspberry\u201d you spoke of has the very serious risk of getting infected.\u201d I stated leaning in with my saw.\n\nToms eyes grew wide with terror.\n\n\u201cWhat in the fuck Tony!\u201d Gregory yelled\n\n\u201cAaaaah Anthony.\u201d I quickly corrected with a jest.\n\n\u201cHow did you even get a bone saw in here anyway? That's surgery equipment! All we do is stabilize the patient and get them to the hospital!\u201d\n\n\u201cI apologize Gregory\u201d, I said tapping the vein in my arm with an IV tube.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing now!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt appears to me as if young Thomas has lost a great deal of blood. If we are to stabilize him, we must input more blood into his system. Mine being accessible I figured we wo\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cENOUGH ANTHONY! Just drive the truck!\u201d\n\nI bowed my head and scrunched out the back of the ambulance. \u201cApologies gentlemen.\u201d\n\nI hopped into the driver\u2019s seat and took off. Twirling the ends of my mustache as i drove. It\u2019s a nervous tick.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that dude\u2019s deal?\u201d Whispered Thomas.\n\n\u201cNobody knows man.\u201d\n\nI pretended not to hear them.\n\n\u201cIt seems we have arrived at our destination gentlemen, rouse yourselves and make haste!\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, Anthony would you mind bringing Tom here in? I have some things I would like to take care of in here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would be absolutely honored Gregory\u201d I really was.\n\n\u201cTom, onward to our next adventure\u201d I said offering my hand to help him down.\n\n\u201cAlrighty.\u201d he said ignoring my assistance.\n\nAs the double doors to the emergency room opened I announced our arrival, \u201cWe would like immediate assistance over here!\u201d\n\nTara, an intake nurse I was familiar with approached. \u201cHey Anthony, what do we have here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know this weird hipster?\u201d Tom asked.\n\n\u201cWeird hipster? Thomas is one of our favorite EMTs. Around here, we joke that whoever thinks chivalry is dead, has not met Anthony\u201d\n\nI could feel my cheeks getting hot.\n\n\u201cA thousand thanks lady Tara. As you can see Thomas here is in need of some stitches on his forehead. Also the scrapes on his leg need the attention of some serious antibiotics or I fear he may lose it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa! Thank you Anthony, thorough as always.\u201d Tara laughed rolling her eyes. \u201cCome with me Tom, let\u2019s get you taken care of.\n\nAs I walked out of the double doors I saw Gregory leaning against the truck talking into his mobile device.\n\n\u201cNo Pat you don\u2019t understand, I want out, I need a different crew! It\u2019s like he has no idea what he\u2019s doing\u2026\u201d\n\nI crouched behind a potted plant outside the doors.\n\n\u201cYes I understand he has seniority\u2026 Your not listening, Pat. Today he tried to cut a man\u2019s leg off for having a scrape, and last week he asked me to give a dehydrated six year old cocaine to quote \u201cget rid of her headache.\u201d Does he even have a medical license? I\u2019m telling you Pat, if im not on a new truck tomorrow, I\u2019m out.\u201d Gregory put his phone in his pocket paced for a couple moments and hopped into the passenger seat. \n\nI crept out from behind the planter and took my spot in the driver seat. Gregory sighed as I got in but neither of us looked at each other. We stared straight ahead for a few minutes silently. I had to break the silence, I have never been one for long pauses.\n\n\u201cListen Grego\u2026 Greg, I am so very sorry. I understand working with me is difficult sometimes, I\u2019m only trying to help. My methods may be problematic for many people, but they are tried and true. Listen Greg, I love what I do, I was made for this job, and dare I say it? I\u2019m good at it. I only lost 33 people last year!..... Partners?\u201d",

The younger dems guys are all in their twenties with patch spots of some FOG &lt;fucking old guys&gt; and ladies on their second careers. But, I wouldnt trade this for anything. \nI came back from the war different, biologically different, but everything was the same. Science hasnt figured me out yet. CBC, CMP, and all the other lab work comes back pretty good minus some crap lipids due to always working nights not only to hide my age but myself from the world as it repeats over and over. In reality I blame mostly MCDonalds...but when the mcrib is back I'm on it like a blitzkrieg.\n\nEvery so often old habits come back but some habits are why the new ones exist. They get forgotten. Somehow so do I. People ask how i stay the same and my reply is Avon; we get enough lonely old ladies trying to sell us this stuff as we shuffle them off to the hospital it's a running gag, yet in reality it's a marker that it's time to be on the hunt for a single male in his twenties that is a john doe and move.\n.......off to pick up pizza I guess might as well keep those LDL doing something",

Each shot of the cannons releasing flashes of blue and red as they smashed against the wall as if cracking open the delusions of Tomas and letting in reality. The man he treated had never had the same face twice. It had gone through so many changes, from young homeless children to even Charles XIII once, but it would never once again be the face Tomas truly wished he could save. This particular time the face had been dismembered by a round that was developed centuries after the battle. One fragment had lodged itself into and upper section of the man\u2019s throat. The young medic pulled out his knife, and with the steadiness of someone far more experienced then Tomas in 1648 had been, moved his knife to make an incision, before a voice began to break through the boundaries of his delusions. \n\n\u201cJames. JAMES!\u201d The Swedish soldier yelled as he grabbed at the knife. Yet when he looked up the man in the blue coat the Swedish soldier had left and instead the man who had long ago been known as Tomas was staring into the eyes of another paramedic. \u201cThat knife\u2019s not sanitary.\u201d\n\n\u201cJames\u201d looked down at the ancient, weathered knife of the Czech army. Had he brought the old thing to work with him today? James soon decided however that he could ponder that when a man wasn\u2019t dying before him. \u201cYes of course you\u2019re right.\u201d He replied.\n\nWith a scalpel now instead of a combat knife the tracheotomy was performed. The ride to the hospital however left significantly more room to think as much of the work needed to be done to sustain the now stable mans life was done by his coworker as insisted, likely now suspicious of \u201cJames\u2019s\u201d competence. Tomas could now go back through all the thoughts that he had every time he experienced the hallucination. What had his friend\u2019s original face looked like? Most of the early faces from that hallucination were forgotten, even that if the great Carolus Rex he had now superimposed the face from a painting onto for lack of a better image. Why was he still alive? This question never got anywhere of course, and it never would. And why of course did he keep reliving the moment of the end of what had been the end of a lifetime of war for his friend but merely a fraction of an eternity for him?",

            "comment": "Well this is peculiar, I've never seen a writing prompt that seemed so directed toward me. It's especially odd that I'm seeing it tonight, on Reddit's front page. I'll just say this - I'm actually a paramedic, in real life. I think you're already pretty iffy on that, so I won't elaborate about anything else. From what I understand this is a subreddit for fiction writers anyways. \n\nWe got a call tonight for a psych, code 2. I can't tell you the address because that's a hippa violation. But psych code 2 means somebody's got a case of the blues and it's not that important of a call. \n\nAnyway, this lady's got a white camino parked on the front lawn, and water damaged cardboard boxes cluttering the driveway. \n\nMy partner's name is Bethany. She's an EMT, but a damn fine one. The way it works on the boxes out here each ambulance gets one medic and one EMT. I run the show, basically.\n\nSo I knocked on the door, and received no answer. I knocked again and still nothing. Bethany suggested I contact PD or at least wait for Fire. I looked her in the eye and cancelled Fire over the radio partly to show her how salty I was and also because I had a better idea and that was to open the door, which wound up being unlocked, and let us both in. She trailed behind with the gurney and equipment while I entered and looked around for the patient. \n\nThe lights were all off, so it was pitch black inside. This isn't that unusual - 70% of the calls we get in EMS now adays are old ladies who can't walk. Which means they're not going to call 9-11 than bounce around turning all the lights on in the place and prepare you a nice pot of warm tea.\n\nNone of the light switches worked, so I continued to announce my presence as I walked through the place. Odd but oh well, not everyone pays their electric bill. Bethany stayed behind, near the front door, which I can understand because she's got concerns that don't bother me anymore. I always carry a penlight in my pocket on psych calls because often times they turn out to be overdoses. If it's heroin and their pupils are constricted, I can whip out some Naloxene and begin treatment. So I pull out my penlight and use that to navigate through this shit hole of a home. \n\nYou ever seen that show call hoarders? I haven't, but there might be an episode about this place. I'm not sure if its normal for hoarders to shit in every room of their residence but this lady sure did. \n\n\"Who's there?\" she finally says. Her voice comes from the back room. \n\n\"Paramedics,\" I say. \"What's bothering-\"\n\nMy voice stopped once I saw her. Sweat was pouring off her forehead like it was a goddamn fountain. She was morbidly obese, had gray hair, and was more pale than a ginger. \n\nI set my monitor down and placed the limb leads. Each needed some tape just to stay put.\n\n\"I can't do this anymore,\" she said. \"It's not salvageable.\"\n\n\"What's not salvageable,\" I said, as I secured the electrode to her left leg. I turned over my shoulder, \"Bethany get in here.\"\n\nI finished with the fourth limb lead and checked my monitor for a rhythm. V-tach at 330, I shit you not. I feel for a pulse but it's too weak to palpate. \n\n\"Bethany, get in here!\" I shouted. \n\n\"I don't know why I'm here. I don't get it. I don't like it.\" says my patient.\n\nSo V-tach stands for ventricular tachycardia. It's the rhythm you get when patients are about to die. It's extremely rare in living patients, and pretty much non-existent in alert patients. Oh - and I've never seen it above 250. Her heart rate was 330 at this time.\n\nMy standing orders call for me to cardiovert her. That means applying two giant pads to her then shocking at 100 joules. Same procedure I'd do for a dead person in V-tach, only difference is the joule setting I shock her with. \n\n\"There's something outside!\" Bethany shouted from the front door. \n\nI tossed the BP cuff on my patient, started it up, then pulled out the negative and positive pads and applied them to my patient. BP came back at 72 systolic so I was in the clear to go ahead and shock. \n\n\"Let me die,\" said my patient. \"Please let me die.\"\n\n\"Well you shouldn't have called 9-11,\" I replied. I set the joules to 100 and pressed charge.\n\n\"They're here for me,\" she said. I think she was disoriented, at least I was sure of it when she said it. I pressed shock.\n\nMy first glance was at the monitor, looking for a rhythm change. Ideally she goes back into a perfusing rhythm, but often enough they go straight to asystole. She somehow went into a rhythm that I can't put into words. The rate read around 610, but that's not even possible so don't quote me. \n\nOh my God, that fucking stench. You'll know it when you smell it. The white waxy shit hit my arm, and I looked up to find her skin sloughing off. Like the worst burn patient I ever had. Her face slid down to her sternum, her hair was disintegrating like lit cigarette. \n\nShe was saying something, but her tongue must've been melting too because I couldn't make out the words. But the thing about burn patients is that the skin and muscles melt off the bones while the bones stay put. Her bones were black, and I swear to you they turned to ash and started breaking apart. \n\n\"What the fuck,\" I said. I returned to my penlight, and watched this unfold. I don't really have a good description for this. It was like watching a decomposing body in accelerated time. It didn't make sense from a medical standpoint. And whenever you see that as a medic you start to react like a human. \n\nI packed my shit up and started toward the front door. \"Bethany where are you?\" I said, making my way through the dark house with my penlight. I had the chills and my hairs were raised. I feel really stupid writing all of this down because I thought I was above it. I've seen people die, hell I've seen people talking to me die in front of me. I've seen mangled extremities, babies stop breathing, you name it and I've seen it. I've never seen anything like the shit I'm describing to you, so trust me when I tell you it spooked the shit out of me.  \n\nWhen I got to the front door Bethany wasn't there, only the gurney. I continued to look around but I couldn't find her. I even returned to the patient, at least the chair she wasn't in. The patient's body was nonexistent - no skeleton, no melted flesh, nothing. Even the parts that had melted onto my forearm were gone. I radioed dispatch and requested PD. \n\nWell, that's where I find myself now, sitting in the ambulance parked outside. My partner is nowhere to be seen, and the patient is non-existent. I guess I'll call the coroner but I'm not sure how to explain this. I guess the only other thing worth mentioning is that I just called dispatch and told them my partner is nowhere to be seen. I didn't tell them about my patient because it doesn't make any sense and I don't want that recorded and played back to me in court. \n\nI did, however, ask dispatch about the call they received from my patient. Apparently she had told them that she isn't able to die and doesn't know why. She's been here for centuries and nobody has believed her or given any sensible explanation. This is the part of the story that bothers me the most. I don't really want to get into it. \n\nI don't know what's going to happen from here, and for the first time in a pretty good while I'm pretty scared myself. I'm glad that I saw this prompt tonight, so thank you to the mods for posting it.  \n",

Those who die too often have done so with an image of his son clinging in their hands. \nI look at the newest one beneath me. My hands couldnt save her and I wonder if mercury couldve dulled the pain. Taken her away from it. But no, the nurses would not let me. She looks to be maybe 6. Driven here frantically by a father who was probably the target of the drone strike that killed his daughter. This new crusade is much like the old. Fighting over the land in which my commander walked. The truly just war. Since humans have only sought to take this land one from the other because their leader lusts for its magical power, not for the man who once walked its stones. \nThe next litter is carried in, a man cut with a knife. A wound so familiar. A wound i could have treated many years ago, had i only the means. \nI am Gabriel, and i have seen war from both sides. Yet now i try in vain to save these humans from themselves. ",

Why\u2019s his arm off? Did I do this?  Where did the cannons go?\n\nTanks\n\nTanks...\n\nWe have gauze\n\nAnd antibiotics",

            "comment": "Predictability is really one of life's most underrated miracles. \n\nIf you\u2019re alive then your heart will beat, if you fall over your knees will bleed, and if you inhale then you will enjoy the pleasure of breathing. \n\nUnfortunately, the pale-faced coughing man splayed across the dirt and shrubs of a foreign land he had only heard mentioned in punchlines, didn\u2019t meet one of those criteria. \n\nSo predictably, the bad news is that this man is going to die because he can\u2019t breathe. But this man who's found himself dying on some shrubbery is not the first, nor last person to pop their lung like an old balloon. \n\nAnd thankfully for this man, I am very well versed in the predictability of humans and the location of a lung. \n\nNo matter how much time passes, at their core, humans have always remained the same. Sure, aesthetically they can change, some decades they were plump and fair skinned with blushing cheeks that remain flushed with the consequence of a one night stand. And other decades have been spent as dark-skinned warriors with tense muscles and furrowed brows who\u2019ve just learn the burden of a free gift. But ultimately the things on the inside that keep them alive are all of the same design. \n\nI know, some truly profound revelations I\u2019ve uncovered here. \n\nBut sometimes, its the stupidly obvious things that need the most attention. For example, I use to think that putting leeches on people and draining them of blood was a cure for pretty much anything, nowadays it\u2019s generally agreed that no, blood should stay on the inside and also leaches are disgusting. \n\nBut there is single predictability that not only acts as a folly to my deep and intrinsic revelation, one that not only ruins it but steps on it, throws it into a fire and screams out a giant parting \u2018fuck you\u2019:\n\nhumans will always be really fucking stupid. \n\nAnd no matter how predictable a situation may seem, no matter how routine or mundane fixing something should be, the power of pure stupidity should never be underestimated. \n\nI\u2019ve had my doubts that I\u2019m human myself sometimes. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still here, or how I\u2019ve lasted this long. I\u2019m an anomaly, an inconsistency in the human race. You\u2019re born, you live, you die. And someone must\u2019ve been looking the other way when I was meant to die, but I seem to be stuck in the midway point. Somewhere out there a God, a reaper, an angel, or a serial killer must\u2019ve fucked up in a major way because I\u2019m still here. \n\nHumans are born, humans live, and humans die.\n\nBut all my fears were apparently unfounded because judging by what I do next, I am the biggest stupidest human whose ever fucking lived.\n\nMy decision to work in emergency medical services in a third-world country was based on the urge to do more, to make the most out of my life. \n\nOther people would call this a mid-life crisis and recommend just buying a Ferrari. \n\nThis plan seemed great in theory but actually being here apparently hit a bit too close to buried memories of the broken bones, bloody faces, and endless bullet holes of the last war I decided to attend. Some of those memories were apparently buried for a reason since they were outdated a few fucking centuries ago. \n\nSo this man who is rapidly turning blue has a pneumothorax, which means his lungs don\u2019t work no good due to a hole. That puncture probably has something to do with the shrapnel lodged in his chest. This means there is a lot of blood everywhere. As you can see fellow human, this is all very predictable. \n\nWhat I did next was also very predictable, if it was 1776 and we still fought with swords and had a 40 percent chance of dying before adulthood, sure. But unfortunately this is 2019 and I just reached into an open wound of a man who has definitely not been administered with morphine with filthy hands, no gloves, and a knife. \n\nMy assistant who saw a moron whose job it was to stop the bleeding of a dying man grab a knife and start cutting into him, tore me away. She worked to frantically patch up the mess I started while calling me a crazy bastard. She doesn\u2019t speak much English but since working with me, she thought the effort to learn the all its curses was worth it. I had to agree. \n\nThe man who we had found dying was still wheezing but it was dying down to a pitiful moan as his oxygen-deprived heart begun to fail, and the assistant's chest compressions were getting growing frantic. For some reason I couldn't seem to get up and help, it was like watching a scene from someone else life. \n\nMy hands trembled. For the first time in my life, my hands actually trembled. \n\nI think I\u2019ve been doing this for way too long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally cool prompt, dude! Thanks for a fun little writing exercise.",

            "comment": "I mean yeah, eventually they all die, but that doesn't mean I can't save a few from dying young.  Let me elaborate: I have been around for quite some time and although I lack the mortality that my patients have, I haven't let this endless existence strip me of my humanity. I just can't bear to see them suffer I guess. And I'm not going to brag or anything but I've had to take on multiple identities throughout the years because of some of the advancements I've personally been responsible for in emergency medical assistance. \nI wasn't always a paramedic, first I was a doctor.  Although good doctors are always needed, I personally felt like I could make a better impact in the emergency field, particularly in a setting with less resources to pull from. So let me start from the beginning. It was the early 1900s. The Great War, or what we now know as World War 1, had just begun. I was there as a combat medic, leaving my setting in my office to try and serve my country against the German onslaught that was coming. In the first 30 minutes I saw more men fall than I hope to ever see again as our machine guns sprayed rounds across the bridge on the outskirts of town. No matter how many were taken down though, their ranks seemed to be endless and eventually it seemed like our battle had changed favors. Soon I was sprinting with my partner to grab wounded men by stretcher and Sprint as best as we could off the main battlefield and to where we could tend to them. And there on that battlefield is where I got the first taste of my curse. Bullets hurt, and they're very hot. But when I was shot, no matter how much I bled out all that would happen is I would black out and then I would come to hours later usually laying in the same spot I \"died\" in. So fast forward a few years later, I'm used to my blessing of I'm mortality as I thought of it at the time. Trench life sucks. But here I am with this inability to die, so I volunteered to be a field medic on the most dangerous parts of our global conflict. And I'm proud to say, as a pacifist, that I never killed a soul. A luxury I may not have had, were I capable of dying. \n\nDecades later in the cannabis fields of Vietnam I pioneered the idea to use marijuana as a tool to treat PTSD. Those poor young men didn't ask for that war. And not a single soul on this planet was ready for the soul destroying conflict that it was. And here I sit today, passenger seat of an ambulance in LA. 2019. I've been alive for almost 140 years. I've been 30 for almost 110. Haven't gotten so much as a gray hair or wrinkle. Every so often I move to another part of the world, just so people don't get suspicious of my age. But here in lies the main problem I have. Sometimes I come up on a scenario where the number of patients overwhelms the amount of resources available. Known to EMTs and paramedics as MCI or multiple casualty incidents. In those moments my \"lizard brain\" takes over, and by that I mean I start to act purely on instinct and a few times have implemented certain techniques from back in 'Nam or even worse back from the trenches. Nothing ever happened to get me fired but some of my co-workers were so shocked seeing how naturally I took to some of these crude, life-saving techniques that they just stood there awestruck as I single-handedly saved a full City bus of patients before the volunteer firefighters even showed up. Implementing things that aren't even covered under my scope of practice, but the patients that I had to use such skills on weren't conscious for it. I don't even know why I am writing this even. Maybe because I'm growing tired of moving all the time. Maybe because Im bored of never getting close to anyone. Maybe because I long for a normal life. Seeing young people in love makes me wish I had had a chance at it. Maybe someday I will. But may question today, Reddit, is what should I do with my life? If I can't die, what is the best use of this power? How can I help humanity in the best possible way? Is there something better than what i am doing now, and could it be something where I can stop moving and cutting ties with everyone I know every couple of years? \n\n\n(Kinda went off from the prompt a little. Supposed to be posted on askreddit)",

            "comment": "It was a quiet night, and I hope that it stays that way. But of course, just thinking that will inevitable cause problems. As the sound of the ambulance sirens getting closer proves murphy\u2019s law correct once again. I probably won\u2019t be needed because of seniority, but It is a good idea to be seen, and if I\u2019m needed, I\u2019ll be in the proper location to do something.   \nLooking at my patient tablet I see the date, January 1st 2019. Yeah it is almost time to retire and start over again. It\u2019s been forty years since I last went to medical school. There will be some new advances I should acquaint myself with. I moved through the white sterile walls on my way to the emergency room.   \nIt really seemed to be a quiet shift. Even quiet there were still several rooms, well stalls really that had people being treated. I will always be amazed at just how far medicine has evolved since I started, well how everything has evolved but especially medicine. My eagerness to return to medical school surfaced again as I walked to the nurse\u2019s station.  \n\u201cSlow tonight?\u201d I asked Sarah the head nurse as she sat at her computer inputting some information on, I glanced down at her screen, Jerry Mclinder.    \nHer fingers did not slow as her gaze shifted up to mine and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t jinx us Dr. Shields.\u201d But she still smiled at me. I know she was interested in another intimate encounter. Now was not the time for that, maybe later we could do something, but right now I want to see what issues are being brought in by ambulance.   \nThe paramedics brought her in strapped down on a stretcher. I did a quick glance, there was a lot of blood, it looked like an animal attack. Her arms were bandaged, as was her face. Whatever attacked her got passed her arms, I had seen something like this in the past, she probably was attacked held up her arms to protect her face, and the animal slipped through to maul her face. This was common enough that hundreds of memories of dealing with it flashed through my mind.  \nIt turned to the head nurse and said, \u201cPrep the leaches, the bad blood should be purged first.\u201d   \nShe smiled in amusement before replying, \u201cYou always seem to bring up the archaic medical techniques. I\u2019d be worried if I didn\u2019t know how your humor works.\u201d   \nThat did the trick of returning my mind to the current medical techniques, ones usually more effective than those of the past. Another ambulance siren came into earshot. I turned to Sarah, \u201cYou know what to do, Ill check on the next one coming in, I\u2019l leave her in your capable hands.\u201d   \nAnother nurse was checking her pulse. \u201cIt\u2019s erratic, and she is burning up.\u201d The Stretcher was pushed into one of the empty stalls. I moved to the entry door and got ready to observe this next patient coming in.   \nThe ambulance entering this time, was coming in a little too fast for my taste. I stepped back pulling the two nurses that followed me outside back as well. The ambulance started to slow just before reaching the unloading point. But not fast enough. The two vehicles collided with the loud sound of metal tearing metal emanating from the point of contact. Both vehicles moved forward, until the mass of the first stopped the second one. Once the impact was finished, I rushed out, it was time to check on the driver and his partner and their patient. The next sound was a scream.   \nI rushed around the vehicle and made it to the drive\u2019s door. Looking in I could tell it would require a lot of work to get him out, considering he was pinned in and he was unconscious. The security at the entrance was already on his radio calling for some additional support. So, I moved to the rear of the vehicle, the doors were closed, and I opened them quickly, knowing that it would probably not be pretty inside.   \nI was right, there was blood everywhere as the stretcher with the patient had come loose and was flipped over, on t op of the other paramedic in the ambulance. He was screaming, but the patient on the gurney had to be unconscious or had a bad break on his back considering his leg was sticking out at an unnatural angle. There was another sound that was out of place in an accident like this. Some sort of wet squishing sound almost drowned out by the screaming. I stepped in to see about flipping the stretcher over and checking on the screaming paramedic.   \nThere was something odd going on. The stretcher was not wanting to flip over. After a moment and some exertions of strength I managed to flip it off the paramedic. And was rewarded with a spray of arterial blood to my jacket. The screaming tapered off. There would be little to be done for him. So I turned to the stretcher The patient had a blood splattered face. And his mouth was chewing. I stepped up and his eyes locked on to mine. I stepped back in horrible recognition.  \nThose eyes were the same ones I saw almost three centuries ago. The eyes were desiccated and covered in lots of scratches. There was no one left to see on the other side of that soul gazing window. I carefully moved out of the future death trap and secured the door. Turning to the security just arriving I told them, \u201cNo one is to enter the rear of this ambulance at all! I need the one with the jaws of life with me, we might be able to do something for the driver.\u201d A worrying thought popped into my head as I moved to the front of the vehicle again, what if the girl from earlier was part of this. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. So, I would deal with this first, then check on the progress of the first patient.\n",

My partner Peter has been with me for the last fifteen years and truly, he is one of my closest friends as of late. He too was a vet though, he doesn't know thats another thing we have in common. For I was in eastern europe during the height of the 30 year war. Many people were dead and medics were in high demand. That's where i came in, a not too well off kid on the battlefield helping men to their feet or sometimes ending their suffering \npermanently. One day however i became seperated from the battalion during a patrol and came upon a dying old man who seemed out of place. His wounds were fresh and just like any caring individual that lives to mantain life i treated the old soldier, his outfit not matching the time period at all. and upon finishing his wounds he smiled at me softly, and i smiled back understanding his unspoken words when i focused onto his eyes. Horrible grotesque eyes from something dwelling deep, deep in the ocean depths. He waved a slow goodbye as i awoke in my cot in a sweat but shrugged it off as a nightmare until 6 months later when the same old man appeared to me as i was preforming surgery. He spoke in a gravely and ancient voice. His words coughing up insanity and sea water, it dribbles into the open cavity\n\"Let him go my young disciple, and experience my gift.\" My mind said no but my hands willed their way to his artery and i subtly slice it without the nurse knowing. My thoughts are reeling as he bleeds out. I scream for gauze and make futile attempts to stop the bleeding when all at once a wave of pure ecstacy rushes through my being and into my very soul filling me with unknowable knowledge both terrifying and old. I regained my facility's instantly not giving too much away to the nurse. The old soldier never moved once but his alien eyes stare at me and he smiles. \n\nFor years after i stumbled upon the secrets to life every time i treated people that wandered in the middle lands of limbo. Their wounds and suffering sings to me like a heavenly angel telling me delectably terrifying secrets. The reason i brought this up is because that man that died on the table for this was my best friend during service. This precious gift requires the blood of the people i hold dear. As the years went on i found myself more and more lonely. Now these days i try really hard not to fufill the requirement again. For such a price is becoming more and more taxing on a man who cant die. But hell, what can i say? Nothing is ever free, and who knows maybe ill make a friend again after me and Peter go on our yearly hunting trip this weekend.\n",

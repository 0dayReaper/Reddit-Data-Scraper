            "comment": "\"As I looked in my rear view mirror I saw police lights flash, \"Damn must've been speeding,\". I slowly pulled over expecting a quick ticket and to be sent on my way. The officer walked up to my window, he looked at me, and swiftly turned. I began to worry as a bead of sweat fell down my forehead. I glanced at the moon, \"Some things are so simple yet complicated.\" I thought I don't remember why. I looked in my mirror yet again and saw another police car pulling up, \"Shit what's going on?\" I thought as 2 police officers walked up, they quickly made the hand gesture for me to roll down my window. They seemed scared somehow, I glanced at the other officer. Her hand place on her gun not yet pulling it out, but ready. \"Excuse me sir you need to step out of the vehicle!\" He barked out, pulling me out of my chain of thoughts. I quickly asked \"For what is the reason officer?\" He said back \"You have a warrant for your arrest, its a theft warrant.\" I opened the door slowly, the other officer tensing up as she kept her eyes firmly planted on me. As he placed me in custody I asked \"Who filed these reports?\", he said \"I am not a able to disclose that.\" as well as a quick \"All that you say can and will be held against you in court.\" I was then taken to a temporary holding cell, because it was a Saturday I wouldn't be able to get out until Monday. I hadn't stolen anything I do not understand why I was arrested. That's what happened when I was arrested. Is there anything we could do to appear better in court?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked my lawyer.",

            "comment": "A good thief can steal something. A great thief can steal it without their victim ever knowing. But the best thief in the world? She can steal without even knowing about about it herself.\n\n----\n\n\"I assure you, I've never once seen the palace nevermind robbed it!\", she told them, not just a little exasperated. Once again, the polygraph showed no evidence of dishonesty.\n\n\"This time three witnesses can place you within 10m of the palace, weeks before the crown was stolen,\" scoffed the baton-weaving oaf across from me. \"And your neighbors say you were out the night of the burglary. Where were you on June the 13th?\"\n\n\"Where was I, on a random day 5 months ago? I have no idea, put me away officer!\" came her retort. If this was merely the first time she'd been sat in this chair, being asked these same questions, she would not be so brazen. \n\nAlas, this marked the fourth time she had to entertain these fools. Four times, she had been brought into this very interview room, only to have mere circumstantial evidence of her supposed ill-doings thrown at her like they were incontrovertible evidence. \n\nThe interrogation continued as it always did; more circumstantial evidence, in this case amounting to a trail of he-said-she-said, borderline contradictory statements, and as always, she maintained that she knew nothing and less about any of it. And that no, she doesn't remember where she was half a year ago, nevermind who she spoke to that day.\n\nSatisfied they'd wasted enough tax dollars \"for now\" they released her back into the world. \n\n----\n\nGlumly, having lost another half-day to tax-funded incompetence, she arrived back home for the day. She was sinking into the couch, preparing to de-stress, when she bolted up. On the opposite wall was a poster, a stylized QR code design that she'd never once seen in her life. A blinding flash of light and searing pain filled her existence near-immediately. \n\nAnd a moment later, pain and light were replaced with new memories-- and _immense_ satisfaction. She sank back down into the couch.\n\nFour times she'd been brought into that room, and four times she'd gotten away with it, too.\n\n----\n_This feels a little bit too A to B but here we go!_",

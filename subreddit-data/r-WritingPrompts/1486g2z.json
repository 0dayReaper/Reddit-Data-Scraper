            "comment": "*Tick. Tick. Tick.*\n\n\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d \n\nYes, he could. It had been a while since he was conscious, carefully compiling every piece of information he could get about his surroundings. \n\n\u201cNo response,\u201d the blurry figure in front of him murmured to someone standing at the side, \u201cCheck his reflexes.\u201d \n\nImmediately, he retreated into his own consciousness. It was something he\u2019d started practicing the moment he realised he was being restrained in an unknown place. It didn\u2019t hurt that his thoughts felt so much more fluid and fast in his head now, so it wasn\u2019t that hard to put himself into a mental black box. \n\nHe waited patiently in the depths of his own skull. He didn\u2019t try to check when the strangers would leave but instead counted the time in his own head, emerging only a few hours later when he had guessed they would have left. \n\n\u2018Anna\u2026\u2019 \n\nIt had always been the two of them, growing up. He felt that he had sheltered her, as he should have as the elder twin. Perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have been so surprised that she hadn\u2019t cared for him at all. Feelings are not always reciprocated, even for family. He knew this before. He was just too stupid and na\u00efve to accept this fact back then. \n\nWas it really so surprising she\u2019d gotten rid of him the moment he was vulnerable, sending him off to this place? \n\nHe had a few guesses on where he\u2019d ended up. He was obviously a test subject of some kind. Not the only test subject either, going by the conversations he\u2019d eavesdropped on. As for where he was\u2026 \n\n\u2026easy enough to guess. Both Anna and him had been working as researchers for the Enigmata Hall before his accident. She had obviously taken the opportunity to hide him amongst the fodder sent to one of her riskier research projects. \n\nIt was ironic, really. She had no idea that the brother she\u2019d abandoned had now gained from her betrayal. \n\nBut there was time to get revenge later. Right now he had a more important task at hand. Figuring out how to escape from this lab. Getting his equipment back and hiding his identity. \n\nHe heard footsteps. The guard patrol.  \n\n*Tick. Tick. Tick.* \n\nThe capsule he was being kept in hummed constantly, an annoying buzzing that threatened to break his focus. He carefully retreated into his own mind again, adding the footsteps to his mental map. He had a rough idea of the layout of the lab and the patrol routines by now. He just had to wait for the right moment to escape\u2026",

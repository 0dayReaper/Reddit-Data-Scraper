            "comment": "Malters Bridge was one of the most popular suicide spots in the city. It overlooked the Malters River, where the rush of its white waters was a siren song which beckoned droves of jumpers. In response, the authorities had strung reinforced nets along the underbelly of the bridge. Alarms were also scattered liberally about, so that assistance could be summoned the moment anyone tipped over the edge. The Coast Guard even set up a special patrol detail equipped with powerful search lights and automated hooks which could fish the uncooperative out from the freezing waters.\n\nFor all those reasons, I did *not* choose Malters Bridge as my final destination.\n\nInstead, I had picked a nameless spot upriver, where the lack of barriers meant that one could reach the embankment after a short hike through the underbrush. I had shrugged out from my uniform, which was folded neatly upon the ground. My shoes came off next, then my watch, then my service revolver, then the envelope addressed to the department. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, then began the walk towards the waters. My leg hurt something wicked, but it would all be over soon anyway.\n\n\u201cMatthew? What are you doing?\u201d\n\nI whirled around. The soft glow of moonlight silhouetted her perfectly, but I didn\u2019t need to see to know who it was. Her voice, her accent, it wrapped itself around me, sapping away the resolve I was struggling so hard to hold onto.\n\n\u201cThe hell\u2026 how did you know I was here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer your phone, and I was concerned that-\u201d\n\n\u201cJeanne! For goodness sakes, just\u2026 just go away!\u201d My voice, higher and more shrill than I was happy to admit, was on the verge of cracking. \u201cI need to do this, OK? Just\u2026 forget you saw me tonight. Just leave me to do what I need to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeed to do? Matthew, what the hell are you talking about? Do you know how ridiculous this is? You\u2019re the bloody hero of the day, and you-\u201d \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d I screamed. The rage boiled up in me, rising with the fury of an uncaged bobcat. \u201cDon\u2019t call me a hero! I\u2019m not a hero! I\u2019m not a damned, bloody hero!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you are\u2026 you saved all of them from the ferry, didn\u2019t you? Isn\u2019t that what a hero is?\u201d Jeanne held up her hands, turning them around briefly so that I could see that she was not hiding anything. She lowered herself to her knees, then sat on the ground. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not here to\u2026 tie you up or anything, even though you\u2019re doing something god-smackingly stupid. I\u2019m just here to listen to you, alright? So why don\u2019t you walk back here, away from the water, and tell me\u2026 just tell me what the *hell* is going through that thick skull of yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not my partner right now, OK? This\u2026 this isn\u2019t work. This isn\u2019t the bloody precinct!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 I just have to know, Matthew. We were doing so well, weren\u2019t we? Persevering from one clue to the next, and then we were on the tail of the Red Mist himself! He was on the same damned ferry as us! We were that close to him!\u201d\n\nThe Red Mist\u2026 I looked down, and realized my fists had curled up at the very mention of the name. A cackle escaped from me, which gained steam until the tears were streaming down my cheeks. The hundreds of hours poured into chasing him down, into studying every single lead which crossed our desks, into stakeouts all across the city\u2026 it suddenly seemed all so *petty*.\n\nWhat was the point of being able to apprehend the worst serial killer the city had ever seen, when my hands were not clean themselves?\n\n\u201cIt was all a trap, you know. Right from the start. He had the sleeping gas rigged to go off throughout the ferry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jeanne said. \u201cBut that is what the Red Mist does. We knew the risks, but we had to do it still.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly because we believed it was the best chance we had at catching him! It was the only reliable intel we\u2019ve had in years! And look at what we ended up with! He slipped away again, and over a dozen people drowned... for what? A chance to get close to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cMatthew\u2026 you know *everyone* could have drowned if it wasn\u2019t for you. If you hadn\u2019t taken control of the situation, gave the right orders at the right time, more than a dozen could have-\u201d\n\nI shook my head. The lies had gone on long enough. It was all going to end tonight. \u201cListen, Jeanne. There\u2019s something I didn\u2019t tell the Chief, or any of the reporters. I didn\u2019t wake up on the deck. I was\u2026 in one of the recreation rooms. I caught a glimpse of the Red Mist, just before he closed the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d Jeanne\u2019s eyes glinted in the dark. \u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I couldn\u2019t really see. Not tall, around your height, maybe. But that\u2019s not the point. He had his mask on, anyway. See, I wasn\u2019t alone in the room. There were others there too, a dozen of them, elderly folk who looked like they had just been plucked out from a nursing home. All of them, asleep, one of them with her bridge cards still in her hands!\u201d\n\nJeanne was anything but slow. I watched the understanding creep across her face, like dusk stealing across the horizon. \u201cThe ones\u2026 who drowned?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! The Red Mist had them all\u2026 tied down. Locks upon locks, knots upon knots. A heap of keys on the floor. He even had a card there, left for me to discover. \u2018Save these\u2026 or save the rest?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure that\u2019s what he wrote?\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand it too. Why not just kill them with that dagger of his? Reduce them all to nothing but vaporized blood? Why go to all the trouble of immobilizing an entire ferry, then giving me stupid games to play? That\u2019s when it dawned upon me, Jeanne. He wasn\u2019t there to kill me. He was there to *break* me.\u201d I turned back towards the Malters River. The tide was rising, and though I hadn\u2019t taken a step since, the waters were lapping around my ankles. \u201cI\u2019m done, Jeanne. Go find someone else to take down the Red Mist. I\u2026 I can\u2019t sleep anymore, you know. All I see are their faces. Waiting for me to wake them up, to free them\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did what you had to,\u201d said Jeanne. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t\u2026 choose\u2026 so many more would have died. Don\u2019t you see that? It\u2019s the greater good!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why then did I leave that out of my report!\u201d I roared. \u201cWhy was I ashamed of the choice I made? Was I afraid of being judged? Could I even have brought myself to look at their families, and to tell them how I chose to abandon them? I can\u2019t, Jeanne! I\u2019m not a bloody, *damned* hero! I\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m just damned\u2026 you have to let me go now, Jeanne. I have to do this. I have to go.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t stop me this time. The catharsis spread through me, churning with the cold to summon the goosebumps to my flesh. I had gotten far enough for the waters to reach my knees when I heard her speak again, her voice somehow cutting through the winds billowing about me.\n\n\u201cYou remember the legend behind the Red Mist, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI did. It wasn\u2019t something I would likely forget anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThe Red Mist doesn\u2019t kill wantonly, despite what the media would have you believe. There\u2019s a hidden pattern to his attacks, a twisted meaning to the way he chooses his victims. It\u2019s easy to dismiss him as just another sadist so discontent with his own life that he purposely picks off the very best amongst us, in some demented way of reducing the overall *quality* of those left behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Misunderstood Savior theory?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a toxic byproduct of all the sick minds who worship him. They think he is killing so that he can deliver them unto an unspoiled earth, one that will steer clear of the destruction awaiting ours. It\u2019s nonsense, all of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust imagine, Matthew. Indulge me, with those last few seconds of your life. Imagine if the Red Mist truly had an enchanted blade, and was truly capable of sending all those people away to a parallel Earth. That would line up nicely with the victim reports, yes? Neatly distributed across all backgrounds, all occupations, all specializations\u2026 in just the right proportions to repopulate the planet?\u201d\n\n\u201cJeanne, please don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re buying into that crap. If this is a ploy to make me come back up and take back the investigation from you, then you\u2019ve got-\u201d \n\n\u201c*Listen*, Matthew! Across all the victims, did you ever see any politicians? Any leaders? Anyone who could conceivably lead a hypothetical group of people stranded in that parallel dimension, bereft of any semblance of leadership?\u201d\n\n\u201cPoliticians? Hah! If only the Red Mist would do us the favor of taking a few of our \u2018leaders\u2019 away from us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever considered,\u201d asked Jeanne, \u201cthat the Red Mist is now looking for those people who can make the toughest of decisions? Those amongst us who shy away from power, and yet are capable of rising to the occasion when needed? Who can focus on the greater good, without wavering, and who can make the best of a shitty, *shitty* situation?\u201d\n\nI turned, and was just in time to see Jeanne leap up from her sitting position. That was impressive in and of itself, but the way she danced across the uneven ground, the way she propelled herself towards me, the way she practically *skipped* across the surface of the water... she was a silky shadow, flitting effortlessly through the space between us. In her right hand was a curved dagger, its edge impossibly bright. The reflection of the moonlight off its polished surface left streaks burning in my eyes.\n\n\u201cSee you on the other side,\u201d she said.\n\nI never even felt the slash across my throat.\n\n--- \n\n/r/rarelyfunny\n",

            "comment": "It whispers to me, softly and sweetly, reminding me of the promise it makes.\n\nAmazingly I discovered it at a garage sale after my neighbor died.  He was some kook who refused to leave his house since basically the 1940s, whittling away his father's fortune in a refusal to interact with the rest of the world.\n\nWhen he finally kicked the bucket, his grand nephew sold nearly everything in the house, including the collection of swords and knives left over from World War two.  A little pile of Japanese steel that glinted and sparkled, despite the day being entirely overcast.\n\nIt called to me that day as it does now.\n\nWhispering.\n\nYearning.\n\nPromising.\n\nPromising of a world torn apart by fire, divine and nuclear, all encompassing and devastating our planet.  When you hold the knife the world becomes very, very small, and a vision jerks you into the atmosphere, so far away you can see almost every inch of the earth bathed in flame.\n\n*This is what awaits those who don't taste me,* it whispers.\n\nThen the world becomes an Eden, a paradise of green and blue and health.  Vibrant and beautiful, an entire world of hope and glory.\n\n*When a soul enters me,* it would speak softly, drowning out every thought and part of you, *I send them here.*\n\nHow much did I pay for that knife?  Ten, fifteen bucks?\n\nDidn't matter.\n\nSalvation is priceless, I would say.\n\nWhatever they say about me now, I consider myself a shepherd of lost souls and a doomed planet.  It took them faster than I expected to plaster my face over their screens and windows, but nonetheless I refuse to turn myself in.\n\nTo doom more to the fire that is to come.\n\nI park my car not too far from my intended target.  Already I can hear them, the light, cheery voices of youth echoing over the pavement.  \n\n*Save the innocent,* the blade tells me.  *Spare them of the world to come.*\n\nA woman sees me in the parking lot and says nothing, simply points and then sprints away.  It matters little, I will come for her when the time is right.\n\nMore shouts.  A bustle of activity, of locked doors and hurried calls.  \n\nLittle time.  There's little time to accomplish what I must do.\n\nI make my way through halls and corridors, looking for the rooms containing the youngest of the children.\n\nWhy are they so afraid?\n\nDon't they see?\n\nDon't they see that their world is doomed and I have come to give them the release to a better one?  To save them from all this suffering and pain, and the oncoming holocaust of fire?\n\nFlames lap at my heels, but I cannot see them.\n\nI attempt to break down a door, but it holds fast.  Heavy in its weight and unyielding in strength.\n\nSomeone yells at me to stop.\n\nA portly man in blue holds a weapon pointed at me, but no, no not those they won't save the children, they only send a soul to the twisting emptiness between worlds to howl into the dark.\n\nI'll save the man, then.  I'll save them all.\n\nI raise the knife and it yells, deafening in its command, that blood must spill and fill the blade, and I scream and charge.\n\nWeights slam into me, though I hear nothing, the great buzzing and voice still speaking to me, overlapping in order and command.\n\nBlood, hot and beautiful, clogs my throat.  I'm drowning, drowning in my own blood.\n\n*Not here,* I think to myself, though it's distant and weak.  The buzzing of the knife's command overpowers any though, even those in service to the blade.\n\n*I cannot drown here, cannot die here, there are so many left, so many left to the fire, I cannot stop now.*\n\nShouts.\n\nMore shouts around me, and the man stands over me, his face pale and white, sweat dripping down from his forehead.  A man who cannot believe what he has just done.\n\nDarkness spreads from the corners of my eyes, obscuring my vision.  Cold.  Frozen to the ground, unable to move or speak or scream, I wait for the void.  It finds me, though it takes its time.\n\n*It's him,* the man thinks to himself, inspecting the corpse he has just made.  *With that weird, long knife.*\n\nElementary school security officer one, psychotic serial killer zero.\n\n*What the hell is that, what do you even call it?* the man thinks, looking at the blade lying limp in the dead man's hand.\n\nCurved.\n\nVicious.\n\nSharp.\n\nHe inspects the blade, watching the man's blood pool beneath it.\n\n*Pick me up,* a voice tells him.  It's soft and sweet.\n\n*Pick me up,* the knife tells him.  Speaks to him.  Coos and woos him, seductively calling him from the deep dark blood of its previous wielder.\n\n*We must continue our work.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nr/storiesfromapotato",

She had been sleeping peacefully for the last 3 hours as I sat and watched her, the knife laying across my lap. \n\nI remember clearly the day it arrived. In a dream, a booming voice called out to me, telling me that I am to be the salvation of the Earth, and the savior of so many. I was told that in 5 years time our planet would be consumed by fire and destruction, and that this knife was the key to saving as many as I could.\n\nI didn't start with family, that would have made it too obvious who I was. Initially I murdered random people on the street. Homeless people who were suffering, drug addicts and alcoholics that no longer felt they had purpose in this world. I was bad at it at first... I felt incredibly guilty for the suffering I caused the time I had to stab a woman 23 times to get her to stop screaming. Over time I had honed my craft, and now found immense joy in knowing that my victims would painlessly slip away to a better place. \n\nWhen I was told my wife was dying during childbirth, I came so close to blowing my cover so I could save her life, save her from an eternity of nothingness. But when I saw my daughters sweet face as she lay across my wife's chest for the first and last time... I couldn't bring myself to ruin that moment with bloodshed.\n\nAnd so here I was a year later... the world would end in 6 months, but my daughter and I would not be there to see it. I stood and raised my knife over my head.\n\nAs it fell through the air, though, my door was slammed open, a swat team barged in shooting my in the back three times. I fell, panicking as I realized I had fallen onto the dagger. I crawled towards my daughter as the police lifted her out of her crib. She was crying and I tried to call out, but I could not find my breath.\n\nI awoke in a paradise, crowds of people surrounding me and cheering. Tears of joy falling down their faces as they thanked me for saving them... Many of them hugged their families as they smiled at me, but I would never see my family again.",

            "comment": "\"The coroner's report just came in\" shouted Dahiya, rushing to greet me as I stepped out of the elevator into the crowded precinct. \"It's...weird\" he continued, as he followed me to my desk. Setting my coffee down on the table, I grabbed the report from his hands and bade him summarise it. \n\n\"They found trace elements of glass...and what appears to be silver residue on the wounds. The victim was killed by what looks like a shard from a mirror. That's the eleventh one that shares the MO\" said Dahiya. \"What do you think it means?\" \n\n\"It means we have a dozen bodies and an MO, but no suspect\" I grunted. \"What about the victim that didn't have the silver and glass residue on them?\" \n\nDahiya heistated. \"They reckon it's the same killer, based on the pattern of the incision and the methods employed in the murder. Perhaps they were trying out a different weapon...getting accustomed to their pattern?\" \n\nI sighed. \"Whatever it is, we'll find the sick mind that did this. If it's the last thing I do\" I said, preparing to pore over the report before starting my day. \n\nDahiya hesitated. \"I'm sorry, I know this must be hard for you. We can ask for a re-assignment if you want?\" He waited patiently for a response. \n\nI grew impatient. \"Why? Because my wife was murdered by whoever it was? No, all the more reason why I should be on this case and help catch him as soon as we can. I won't rest till he's behind bars.\" It wasn't until I finished speaking that I realized the stares of the office. I hadn't noticed I was shouting. \n\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean...\" Dahiya began, but I didn't let him finish. \"If you have time to apologise, you have time to help find the killer. Get to it.\"\n\n-------------\n\nI switched the lights on as I came home, immediately hanging my coat and hat on the rack and heading to the basement. The familiar smell of damp greeted me as I turned on the flourescent lights in the basement. I made my way to the middle of the room, where the Mirror stood. The ornate carvings on the wood ran down the entire length of the oblong frame, and were in no language I had ever encountered before, yet felt strangely familiar to me. I gazed into the mirror. Instead of a reflection, I was looking at three people erecting what appeared to be a wooden frame for a house. A fourth joined them, emerging from the wooded area just behind the wooden frame, holding in her hand several berries and fruit that she must have picked while foraging. \n\nHow long had it been since I'd seen her so cheerful? Certainly not since our application for a child had been rejected for the first time. Since the energy crisis, the one child policy had taken it's toll on families, and ours was no different. \n\nI remember the shock at seeing her lying there, bleeding out in front of the mirror, shard in hand. And then looking into the mirror to find her there, as confused as I was. \n\nThere was no time to lose, I had to work quickly. \n\nI thought about providence as I set about carefully grinding a shard of the mirror into a fine powder. Working at the police department had it's privileges. \n\nFirstly, I was able to throw them off the scent by conducting my experiments disguised as a serial killer. I could avoid suspicion for now; no one would suspect the victim to be the killer, least of all a cop. It's why I chose this MO, after all. \n\nSecondly, I had access to the coroner's reports for each kill, which provided me with invaluable information. I knew that you needed to have traces of the Mirror present in your body at the moment of your death in order to cross over. The sacrifice I had made, although not my own, was crucial to figuring this out. \n\nI looked over at the map on the wall in front of me. The river, the city's source of water. I needed a way of getting the powder into the dam. I looked at the bags of home-made poison under the counter, checking to see that they were intact, hoping they would be enough. \n\nSoon, I too would join them in the other world. But not just yet. There was something I had to do first...\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this story and would like to see more from me, please consider subscribing to my subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/phreaklikeme/)!\n\n ",

            "comment": "The feel of blood between my fingers was repulsive.  No matter how long this went on, no matter how many lives I *saved*, that never changed.\n\nThe man crumpled, his eyes going wide even as every last bit of humanity seeped out of them.  His lips parted, one final exhalation slipping between them.  A final word?  A curse? A goodbye?  There was no way to tell.\n\nThe dagger glinted as I pulled it free.  It gleamed, lit from within by its own light.  It had been studied for years, pored over by scientist after scientist.  I'd been one of them, once upon a time.  All that we could tell was that it had some sort of energy translation capabilities.  The papers we released were filled with words like *wormholes* and *parallel universes*.\n\nWe hadn't thought anything of it.  It was just an oddity, a mystery from Earth's past that we couldn't explain.\n\nAnd then the asteroid appeared.\n\nEveryone else had panicked.  The world was doomed, they said, and it was hard to argue with them.  But I'd known.  I couldn't tell anyone how, or why.  I'd *known* that the dagger was the key to saving us.\n\nThey'd disagreed.  I didn't give them the chance to argue it.\n\nI'd been stealthy at first.  Subtle.  And then, as the asteroid loomed higher and higher overhead, my methods had slipped.\n\nThe sirens rang in my ears.  I was out of time - I was out of places to run.  That was fine.  Tomorrow was the end, anyway, if the astronomers were right.  There was no reason to think they weren't.\n\nI'd done all I could.  I clung to the idea, holding fast to some sort of hope.  They'd be waiting for me on the other side.  I *knew* they would be.  They'd see I saved them.  I wasn't a murderer.  I'd never wanted this.\n\nI was a hero.\n\nThe first police car was just skidding around the corner as I turned the blade on myself, plunging the length of steel into my neck before I could lose my nerve.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\nMy eyes snapped open.\n\nI gasped, my whole body shuddering.  What had- What had just-\n\nI didn't know.  I couldn't explain it.  But I was breathing - I was *alive*.  And there was no asteroid in the sky.\n\nThe street around me was different.  Busier.  More lively.  I smiled, honest relief sliding onto my face.  The Earth lived.  I'd done it.  I'd-\n\n\"It's *you.*\"\n\nAt the sound of a voice, I flinched, and then turned.  A man stood a few paces back, his eyes wide and terrified.\n\nI smiled, holding a hand up.  \"Don't worry.  I'm not-\"\n\nHis fist slammed into my cheek a moment later.  I hit the ground hard, biting off a strangled cry.\n\nThe voices rose around me - confusion.  Fear.  Questions, and cries for the police.\n\nBut here and there, I heard it.  \"It's *him*.\"  \"He's the one.  I *remember.*\"\n\nI tried to push myself upright.  This wasn't right.  I was the hero, dammit.  I'd saved them.\n\nWith a knife.  The thought echoed in the back of my mind, chilling me to the bone.  I'd saved them with a *knife*, and they *might* not appreciate that as much as I'd thought.\n\nI tried to cry for help.  I tried to tell them it was all a mistake.\n\nIt vanished in a gurgle as a boot planted itself in my stomach.  They closed in around me, blocking out the sun.\n\n\"Welcome to the other side,\" the man said, grinning.  \"We've been *waiting* for you.\"\n\n(/r/inorai, critique always welcome!)",

Dr. Aeson Cunningham.*\n\nAC: Good morning, PT. How are you today?\n\nPT: I\u2019m fine, doctor, but the food sucks. Why am I still here?\n\nAC: I\u2019m glad you are well. We are meeting today to determine if you belong in this hospital. Do you remember being brought here?\n\nPT: Yes, it was only a few days ago. Like I explained to the cops, and to the nurse who saw me. I am fine. I\u2019m ecstatic, really, because it worked! Like I told them, I was so full of doubt, but knew I had to trust in myself.\n\nAC: What worked? Could you please explain?\n\nPT: The knife worked! I didn\u2019t believe it either, and I understand it sounds crazy, but somehow killing people with that knife brought them here, to this Earth. You don\u2019t remember?\n\nAC: I\u2019m sorry, PT. I\u2019ve never met you before today. And there are over 8 billion people in this world. How could you possibly have killed them all?\n\nPT: I didn\u2019t kill everyone. There were a hundred of us.\n\nAC: That still is extremely unlikely. And what about my ancestors? I remember my grandmother\u2019s cooking when I was younger. You couldn\u2019t have killed her, because she died about twenty years ago. How can I remember her?\n\nPT: Well, no. But the dagger worked by resurrecting the person I killed and everyone within six degrees of separation from that person. I suppose it also worked back and took the ancestors. Maybe Stephen Hawking could explain how the time travel process worked, because I don\u2019t really understand that part either.\n\nAC: How did the dagger know who was within six degrees?\n\nPT: It was explained, but the math involved was too far beyond my understanding. Besides, my mission wasn\u2019t to *understand*, but to *perform.* Remember the asteroid last week? That was supposed to collide with us. You\u2019re welcome.\n\nAC: As I understand it, that asteroid missed us by -.\n\nPT: Yes, because I was able to save you. Don\u2019t you remember the panic? Don\u2019t you remember the curfews? The nuclear missiles?\n\nAC: Like in *Deep Impact*?\n\nPT: Yes, but it actually happened. I can prove it to you. Does a *Kit Kat* bar have a dash?\n\nAC: I\u2019m not sure what \u2013\n\nPT: Just answer. Does it have a dash?\n\nAC: No, I don\u2019t think it does.\n\nPT: Yes, but it *used to!* I have another. Is it \u201cBerenstain Bears\u201d, with an \u201ca\u201d or \u201cBerenstein Bears\u201d with an \u201ce\u201d?\n\nAC: I don\u2019t know.\n\nPT: With an \u201ce\u201d! But now it has an \u201ca\u201d! That\u2019s proof that it worked! There are little differences, and I don\u2019t know why, but they are proof! Just ask anyone! They will remember!\n\nAC: Please calm down. You are starting to get excited. Ok, let\u2019s say you are correct. Where is your criminal record? Surely killing so many people would leave a police record.\n\nPT: It doesn\u2019t exist here, because I didn\u2019t kill anyone here! I killed in the other world, but my record didn\u2019t cross over. Look, you must remember. Look at the discrepancies around you! The Monopoly guy lost his monocle!\n\nAC: So, are you insisting you are a murderer? That is very unusual. You said there were a hundred of you. Do you know any of the others?\n\nPT: I knew only one other person, &lt;redacted&gt;. I attempted to contact him, but I couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. He might not exist in the world. I think he forgot to kill himself at the end.\n\nAC: Have you ever heard of Occam\u2019s Razor?\n\nPT: Yes, the simplest explanation of an event, no matter how preposterous, is most likely the truth.\n\nAC: Correct. So, which is more likely, that you saved the entire world by killing everyone, but have no police record nor any other evidence that a disaster happened. Or, you become so disillusioned by your life that you needed to be important, just once, and created an elaborate story for it, even if it meant incarceration for multiple homicides?\n\nPT: Look doc, I know it sounds crazy, but you must believe me! Just remember! Remember the dream! It wasn\u2019t a dream because it really happened!\n\nAC: PT, I you are getting excited again. I think you need some rest. We can continue this next week.\n\nPT: No please, you must remember!  I\u2019m a hero! Please!  I don't belong here!",

            "comment": "Humanity clung to any semblance of hope as the plague descended upon the few of us left.\n\n20 million had died in the first year alone. In the years following another 40 million would fall victim to what was simply referred do as \u201cblue death.\u201d What made it so terrifying was how quickly it evolved. We couldn\u2019t cure it, but we could prevent it.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly 40 years since we began vaccinating survivors and our children. Governments had made the vaccination mandatory, but now, years later those same children we had saved would go on to say the vaccination had unintended consequences, aside from the obvious blue tint to the skin.\n\nAlthough entirely unproven this new generation claimed the vaccine caused a much higher risk of diabetes. Sure cases had increased since we began vaccinating but the correlation does not mean it\u2019s the cause.\n\nThe new generation in power stupidly gave people the choice to vaccinate their children. It was obvious how quickly this uninformed rumor had spread. Many children no longer had their blue tint. It wasn\u2019t long before the inevitable happened.\n\nCases of blue death began popping up all over the globe. Despite all our research the monster had returned bearing its fangs. Researchers couldn\u2019t get ahead of it.\n\nMany turned to religion to escape the reality of our situation. Belief that beyond this doomed world existed another one. Perfect. Free of suffering. A hopeless prayer. \n\nStill, as I waited for humanity to destroy itself I needed to occupy the time. I was curious what these people saw. Why they grasped for something they could not see. I began to study religion relentlessly. Not any one in particular, but anything I could get my hands on. Through all of the muck I came across a diamond. Sitting patiently in the dirt as if it were waiting to be found. Something so simple it was easily overlooked.\n\nI discovered a sort of roadmap within the texts on Norse mythology. A golden staircase if you will to what they referred to as Valhalla. The only requirement was an honorable death by sword. It did not discriminate. Not by race, gender, or ideals.\n\nI had no proof. Only a gut feeling and confidence in my research. I walked outside to my shed. Bullets wouldn\u2019t do. They weren\u2019t personal enough. There was no honor in death by an enemy you can\u2019t see.\n\n I didn\u2019t exactly own a sword but I could certainly find something. I would save as many as I could. Emergency services were so busy trying to contain outbreaks that I could probably go a few weeks before they noticed the murders were linked. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll save as many as I can.\u201d \n\nI picked up the old dagger and stumbled toward the town.

            "comment": "Christ, it never got easier. Well, it did... in the same way that you'll pick up riding a bike, I managed to make it quick and painless, for the most part. The hard part was the aftermath. They all wore smiles, in their death throes, and the echoes of wisdom in my head told me what I was doing was the right thing. Of course, the authorities assumed it was something I'd drugged them with, or some bizarre case of rigormortis. My first victim was a cat. A stray, mangy creature that was on death's door when it crossed my threshold. The blade called to me, and it seemed to thrum in my hand gently as I looked at the cat. I don't remember what happened after that. But I remember, I remember a... a purr. I didn't leave the house for three days. I lost my job. The blade called to me again. My previous manager, Azelia, was surprised to see me at her house that evening. She welcomed me in, offering me coffee before I slid the blade between her ribs. This time, I remembered, and felt, EVERYTHING. The blade effortlessly bypassed the ribs, piercing her lung, causing a surprised gasp to come out as a quiet gurgle. I felt the surgical, instinctive twitch that severed her heart from her brain. She went quickly. No witnesses. No kids, no partner, thank fuck. When I withdrew the blade, it was clean. The faint red stain below the incision (which is what I always called it, from that point) reminded me of those Catholic images of Jesus. It struck me that she was like a negative of that image. Disposing of her body traumatised me. The tiny amount of blood made it easier to hide any smell, but she still shat herself. Two bin liners, duct tape, and a mattress in the attic gave me a decent head start. I cried the whole time, but the knife, still in the kitchen, told me that the other side was where people had been given the gift of foresight. No future shock, carbon neutral, and the inherent understanding that to harm a member of your own species was to ultimately degrade the species as a whole. It was an act of love that gave me this job.\n\nThe cops got in touch with me eventually, but I'd already taken care of four more good people. The ash rained down as they went through their bureaucratic process on my stoop; they had bigger problems than some people being murdered. The knife told me from under my mattress about the nice men visiting me: Officers Robert Blackburn and Jason Smythe. Robert's youngest, Gabby, was just diagnosed with cancer. She'd grow to solve issues of interplanetary economics if she was taken to the other side. Jason had ideas about prison reform here that would make him governor within a decade there. \n\nIt  made no difference to me. I knew that Kate had to be the next one. She was beautiful. She loved me. And I loved her. And we both loved Tyson. But not Tyson. No. Why not? I asked. The knife went silent. It would talk to me about good people. And only good people. It didn't seem thrilled about Kate, but said that she'd make the cut. I thought we'd raised him pretty well? Some things are unavoidable, the knife replied. He'll be made an orphan when this is through.\n\nI took Kate out to dinner; deep dish pizza, a real treat. Probably not as good as the old days, but definitely not totally synthetic. We went out to the lake that evening, and watched the sun set through the smoke. I gave her a ring, my mothers. We made love, and lay in each other's arms until we dozed off. I awoke feeling slightly groggy, but the knife had things to do. People to help. I awoke her, and kissed her gently, stroking her auburn hair in the dashboard light. Her eyes widened and watered as I broke her heart. For now, my love. You'll be in a better place shortly. She twisted unnaturally, whimpered, and the blade dragged a jagged gash across her diaphragm. No clean incision here. Her face afterward seemed calm, but not at peace. Not like I'd hoped. Ash drifted in through the car window, and dusted her face. Handbrake off, watch the bubbles stop rising, and I stop thinking that some of those bubbles hold her final breaths.\n\nThat was years ago. Now I stand in front of a jury of my peers. The knife wasn't able to predict the future. I was going to get caught eventually. I've begged to be put to death with my own blade. It is wielded by another man now. From across the room, Tyson's eyes meet mine. The blade remains silent. It'll only talk to me about good people. ",

The little life remaining on it has only a few months left 'till the planet devours it, and the intelligent life that used to inhabit it has been taken away. Except for me, and him.\n\nI glimpse the tiny cabin through the few trees that stand in my path. A figure can be seen pacing through the window, the firelight making his shadow larger and his features grotesque. I know what he's thinking, feeling. He's afraid of me and he knows I'm coming. He fears my knife.\n\nThe man in the cabin is my father. I love him dearly which makes this harder than it should be. I *must* do this but I've postponed time and time again, not anymore.\n\nI reach the final tree and slowly get up, he sees me but it's too late to escape. I sprint to the door and reach it at the same time he opens it. Horror and determination fill his face, the former in reaction to my knife, the latter in reaction to his own.\n\nWe fight. He is stronger than me, he always has been but my mind is set and my will is fierce. I stop his downward swing with my left hand as my right drives the knife to his neck, at the last second he catches it and throws it away. A glint of victory shines in his eyes but lasts little, my swift right hook makes him stagger and I take his knife away. With one violent swing I cut his throat, he looks at me one last time and I feel my own choking. *He's crying.*\n\nMy father falls down, the life draining from his body and I fall to my knees. It's over, I tell myself, it's done. I've killed my father, the other remaining person standing on this rock, with his own knife. The killer responsible for wiping out mankind before the planet itself did. The end looms over me.\n\nI weep in a desolate world.",

            "comment": "This is the way the world ends. Not with a whisper, but a cough.\n\nFirst symptom, before it takes over. Second and fatal? The skin starts rotting away, slowly. \n\nMakes doors useless. How can you open up a door, without a fingerprint? Thankfully, doors can be hacked. I let myself into Dr. Hartnagel's house, clutching Salvation in my three fingered hand. She is a sharp one, and she is thirsty. \n\nMy father was the one who named her, and the one who told me. Passed down from generation to generation, the knife that took away life, to give it anew. When I killed with it, I saw them. Arriving on that distant earth. Alive. Free of any marks I had made of them. Free of all injuries. The virus in them was still there, but with it's long incubation time, they would have, oh, about twenty or so years longer to live. That's fine.\n\nI had saved many. So had my father. And my grandmother. All the way back since 13 March 1964. They all knew that sending people to that earth was the only way to save anyone. I was just the first generation to be alive during the end times.\n\nThere were a few conditions to Salvation. Firstly, there had to be at least one other witness. Secondly, Salvation had to be held by a family member. Sadly, my own \"member\" was useless. I am the last angel. And just in time. The virus around the earth would kill off everyone in, working from my family's knowledge of when the last human will die, two years and change. Me? I think I have just a few days left. And that's fine actually. I'm kind of tired anyway.\n\nI crept carefully over the hallway, avoiding the sight of the Camera-Drone. I couldn't have that following me, and it doesn't count as a witness, as I discovered with Samantha. \n\nWhen you're on a mission to save everyone, with so little time, you have to be so careful who you choose. I could have just killed the homeless, the already dying, the weak. But what good would they do in Utopia? Sure, the family story is that everyone on that strange, other earth will  be safe and fine from Judgement day. But I knew the virus was still there. Twenty years of more life? That's still fine. \n\nSamantha was an art student. I had realised that I'd neglected that aspect of human existence. No interest in it. I had other things to do. But maybe people in the new world needed that? \n\nI crept further still. If I was correct with my scoping, Dr. Hartnagel would already be fast asleep, alongside his wife. I'd drugged her already. I made sure to avoid the third stair towards the upper floor. Laser wire.\n\nI neared the bedroom door, and put down my bag of tricks. I needed both hands free to work on the door electronics. Clever little thing, meant to be impossible to open from the outside once all the registered occupants are inside, but I had my ways.\n\nDrifting over to the bed, I made no sound. \"Angel of death\" is what they named me in the media. I kind of liked that description, better than my family's of \"The saviour of one world, and the death of another.\" I was as silent as if I was floating on the floor.\n\nAlthough I knew no one else was near, always better to be safe than sorry. Duct tape is useful at keeping people from screaming at the horror I'm about to inflict on their lovers. Is useful at binding them so I can inflict torment. \n\nThat's the last condition of Salvation. The death can't be easy. They can't know what's happening. They have to die in fear, and pain, and agony, and terror. \n\nI bring out the syringe next, the antidote to the high level sleeping tablets I placed in Ms. Hartnagel meal. A pin prick. And we can begin.\n\nDr. Hartnagel's world will end not with a whisper.\n\nI start, to pleading and begging. Of things about important work being done before I cut off his tongue. I laugh.... you get a little bit numb after a while. His wife holds back tears. Cut. Silent pleading. Cut. Two eyes looking back at the horror. Sadness. Cut. One eye. Constrained to it's fate.\n\nIt's another hour before I'm done. I push the last cut into his throat, and watch, as he coughs up the promised blood. \n\nI see a brief flash of the doctor. He falls to the ground of the new earth. And starts crying.\n\nNot the reaction everyone else has had, but whatever. I glance at the missus. Rage, hate, venom spewing in her eyes. \n\nMy rules tell me to leave, but I mean, what the hell, this is my last act of Salvation. Time to  hear my fan-mail at last I guess. I rip off the duct tape, and give her time to compose her words.\n\n\"You,\" she spits at me, \"do... do you know what you've done.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" even though she never will. \n\nShe spits back. \"No you don't! He was so close! So fucking close.\"\n\n\"Close?\"\n\n\"The cure! He was working on it!\"\n\nAnd that is how I made one world end in two years and a change. Not with a whisper, but a cough of blood.",

My reasoning was good.  \n\n\"Why do you think the world is going to end Mr. Lundgow?\"  \n\n\"The angel who gave me the knife said so.  He claimed that this world was doomed, and that I could save people in a parallel world by killing them in this one.\"  The confused looks on everyone else's faces made it clear I wasn't getting my point across clearly.  \n\n\"This knife?\" Came the reply as the suited man held up an ordinary kitchen knife.  \"There is nothing special about this knife Mr. Lundgow.

Because you murdered 127 children.\"  \n\n\"Saved 127 children sir!\"  I shouted back.  My composure was gone now, but I had saved them and I would not be treated like a criminal for saving lives.\n\n\"You murdered them in their beds Mr. Lundgow.  You murdered them on their way home from school, in public restrooms and while they played in the woods.  You stole the light and innocence of youth from 127 families.  You destroyed the lives of hundreds of people because you are mad Mr. Lundgow.  And you will hang for your crimes.\"\n\n\"I will hang.\" I agreed.  \"I will hang with a clean concience knowing I saved as many as this cruel world would let me.  If you understood the burden that this...\"  I began to cry.  It wasn't easy killing children.  Saving children.  I was trying to speak, but I couldn't.  The tears had their way and my lips refused to form words any longer.  They all looked at me like I was crazy.  But I knew.  I knew what I had done was right.  I could die with that knowledge.\n\nMy biggest regret would be that I didn't get to witness this world end, to prove to them that I was right along.  They would see though.  That I was right.  Those parents would thank me when the time came.  For saving the children I could.  Then I would be viewed as the hero I was. ",

In for a pound. \n\nMathematically it didn't make sense to Dan, and he pondered this while donning his navy fleece jacket. The smallest the number of humans there have been on the planet was somewhere under one hundred thousand. \n\nWhile Dann was prolific, there was no way he could even get a fraction of a fraction of that number. Hell, the genetic diversity of homosapien-sapiens was already extremely hindered, a few hundred humans would soon be more inbred than British royalty and hillbillies.\n\nHe continued briskly down the sidewalk. It was a cold evening, and Daniel had a some time to go. He had actually been summoned to this one, and that hadn't happened since the very beginning. \n\nThis is one of the reasons he rationalizes away the idea of an acute psychosis; there are physical places he knows he needs to go. And he's almost always right.\n\nAnd then what about animals? Plants? Birds? Bacteria? How hard is it going to be to rebuild the world with nothing? No tools and n--Dan stopped in his tracks, as a thought hit him. \n\nIt was such a slap to the face he even said it aloud. \n\n\"I should have been killing construction workers and plumbers. Not just scientists and engineers. Fuck.\"\n\nSure, there were Some blue collar workers. This wasn't so much about selection so much as testing. Drunk found stabbed to death in a truck behind a hole in the wall? Not exactly national news.\n\ndan tried to be as ethnically diverse as possible. Even though he doubted there would be enough people, he may as well try to shake things up genetically.\n\nAs he strode to the locked door, he unzipped his gray jacket to extract a key from an inside pocket. Bronze key in hand, he inserted it into the knob.\n\nWith the deadbolt unlocked, Dann swung open the door. \n\nDaniel stepped through threshold.\n\nIn that instant, the world turned to white and empty and then totally full of-WHAT THE FUCK. Dan looked out to seemingly infinite versions of him. No. There were some variations.\n\ndan froze as a voice boomed through his head. Their heads. Our heads. \n\nIt was his own voice. Maybe. You never sound the same as the voice in your head because recorders don't pickup bone conduction. \n\n\"Okay, I knew this shit would be a problem. Get this through your heads--there's more than one of you working. We're not stupid. We thought of that and now you  know. So stop over-thinking this shit and get back to work because we're on a limited time scale!\"\n\nThen it was gone. Back to reality.

The oppressive heat had disappeared, inviting cooler days, where we no longer had to sweat, and delightfully chilly nights, where folks living with no air conditioning slept comfortably.\n\nI had reached a new level of low in my life. My studies hadn't worked out, my parents were upset, they refused my decision to find jobs and sent to me study accounting locally. My friends were all gone, replaced by new people that I didn't know, didn't want to know, refused to know. I've not had love in 3 years, me being the hopeless romantic that I am, and my cousins all look down upon me.\n\nI had found the dagger in a junk yard one day, in October. The blade was still sharp, unrusted. What was left of my mental functions, all but eaten away by my depression, told me this dagger would deal 1d4 damage, and I probably had only 10 hitpoints. I shrugged, and pocketed it.\n\nThe next month and a bit was torturous, even more so. I started to have feelings of wanting to kill. It first started as a gentle nudge, that someone will be happier if I just took the dagger and stabbed. It then became a a plea, then finally bloodlust. I had long night drives to desolate fields, drinking, smoking, screaming. It was hell.\n\nThat day, I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nI just pierced my skin before I heard\n\n*a melody*\n\ncoming from the wound I made. And with that melody, a vision appeared.\n\nIt was a planet, exactly like ours, yet I saw no cities, no roads, nothing of civilisation. The only technological thing I saw was a sort of factory, where wind turbines spun, and the ceiling adorned with solar panels.\n\nA voice came, as I entered the factory, my vision coasting in through the doors, down a shaft, down to a futuristic city underground. It explained the extinction of my world, the other life forms that predicted it, the backup plans they had made, one of which was this. We had much to do, but if everyone made it there, we will thrive again. It promised bountiful resources, security, and life. It promised comfort, peace, and happiness, if we played our cards right.\n\nIt promised paradise.\n\nI dropped the blade on the floor, the vision gone. I was breathing heavily, a little blood trickling out of my wound.\n\n*\"Do you see, now?\"*\n\nOh yes. Yes I do.\n\nI pick up the dagger once more. I had a job to do.\n\n(Possible part 2)",

            "comment": "\"Please forgive me!\" I said with my voice breaking.\n\"Dont do this! Why are you doing this!?\" The betrayal in her voice was sharp,like a razor cutting across my ear drum.a traumatic beat cutting deeper into my head until i couldnt bare it anymore. I knew what was at stake,but i still struggled to do this.\n\"I am so sorry ,honey\" she squeezed my arm as if begging me to save her.i felt the tears in my eyes accompanied by burning agony screaming at the act i would commit. I wanted her to understand but there was no point in explaining.\n\"Please forgive me\" i repeated again as i plunged the dagger into her heart.\nShe left out one last scream.her breathing became thin.thinner then the air around us. Her grip became weaker then the grip on my sanity. Was what i was told right? I wasnt told how but i was indeed guaranteed that the world would end in a few years. The being who told me definitely was not human...and it gave me this dagger...as soon as i grabbed hold of it...No,there was no way what i was told is a lie. I had hoped it wasnt just me having lost my mind,seeing shit that wasnt there.but i disregarded everything,i was on a mission to save humanity.\n\nI didnt know where to start. I had just done what i had thought would be impossible for me. I left my home which i had turned into a horror house,it wouldnt be long before the cops would show up.theres no way nobody heard the commotion. I splash water on my face hoping to get myself together. And brace myself for what is comming next.\n\nI kick open my front door and plunge the dagger into everybody i see.i must save as many as i can i thought to myself. Like a wolf hungry for blood.men,women and even disgustingly children are lost to this dagger. This isnt real i thought. This *cant* be real. It seemed like a nightmare and i had completely lost my mind. I pushed those thoughts aside and kept slaughtering people in hopes that it would bring their salvation. \n\nIt was inevitable that the police would show up,i knew explaining to them wouldnt help. As soon as i heard the sirens in the distance i knew i had to come up with a plan,i hadnt saved enough people and i knew i wouldnt survive this hour. I ran into one of the nearby houses and began frantically searching for something,but i didnt know what. Anything to help me in my dire desperation. The sirens grew nearer and nearer until they were right outside.\n\n\"We know youre in there! Come out with your hands up or we *will* open fire!\"\nThis is it.i didnt save as many people as i had hoped and it was drawing closer to the end.i had failed and began to give up hope.\n\"Come out with your hands up or we *will* shoot you!\" I heard the officer repeat.\nI wasnt going to give myself up.there was no way.i looked at the dagger in my hand and decidingly knew what my next move was. I grabbed the dagger and aimed it towards my chest. I plunged with all my might and hoped to hit my heart. The pain was unexplainable but i had hoped i did right. I felt my life fading,the dagger disintegrated in my hand,steel turned to sand. It was the last thing i felt before it all went to black surrounded by the piercing sound of sirens.then suddenly nothing but silence and peace.\n\nThe silence was eventually broken by thousands of voices and thoughts that were not my own,there was nothing except blackness to accompany them. At that point i wasnt myself but these voices and thoughts. i began seeing light slowly caress away the darkness as if they were lovers sharing a farewell. And then i came to. I came to in my living room.it looked as if nothing had happened and everything was back to normal.was that just a nightmare?\n\nNobody else is in my home but me.i begin searching the house and find no one. So i head outside and see the greatest thing i will ever see. It had worked. Everyone i had sunk the dagger into was outside trying to figure out what was going on. They spotted me and smiled in my direction.there wasnt as many people as i had hoped but it was enough to save humanity, at the very least we could start anew.they now knew why i had done what i did,they pieced enough of it together and knew why their friendly neighbor had suddenly become a madman. And out of the crowd she came rushing out.rushing to embrace her hero. My heart raced with joy as she jumped in my arms and hugged me with everything she had. She leaned her head in close. A sweet whispering voice that ensured me everything will be okay. One short sentence to bring back hope\n\"I forgive you,dad.\"",

            "comment": "My keep lies atop a hill overlooking the village.  New to this world, yet old, it towers.  Two decades have passed since the rebirth.   I\u2019ve watched them enjoy life below, chalice in hand, content.  It is enough.  \n\nThe thatched roofs below all shelter good people, kind people.  Our other village was the same.    Strangers always found a meal, a bed and a friendly face.  It was as if nothing had changed for them, for me\u2026 everything.   \n\nNo one remembered the other village.  Only awakening covered in blood, me standing over them, as their wounds magically healed.  A cacophony of thanks resounding around me, \u201cThank you my lord!\u201d  \u201cCheers to \u2018im.\u201d  \u201cHero.\u201d    They thought I healed them with the glowing mystical dagger. \n\n I was their friend, their lord and the idea that I would harm them, unthinkable.  I still shudder thinking about it.  I love them all, but knowing I had plunged a dagger into each of their hearts wears on me, keeps me separate.\n\nI smile at the coarse bellow of the sweat streaked blacksmith below, his bark tempered by the hearty laughter that follows.  Life goes on, crops grow, children play and lovers tease, but not for me.  \n\nThere had not been enough time to save everyone.  The faces of those left behind still haunt me.   I would be one of those, save for Edwin, my squire.  He overheard the sorcerer give me instructions for saving the village, just as the fiery debris began to rain down.\n\nClosing my eyes, a vision of the lovely Lady Laverne fearfully backing away, pains me.  I could not bring myself to do the deed.  Edwin, behind me, forced my hand.  As soon as the dagger pierced her chest, a swirling haze, a clap of thunder and she was gone.  Just gone.  The ensuing screams of pain and suffering from the chaos engulfing the village gave me the strength to do what I must. \n\n People ran from me, thinking I had gone mad or was possessed by a demon.   Dear brave Edwin helped me.   We saved all we could.  The fire became so intense, I knew the end was near.  When I turned to Edwin, to dispatch him to safety, he turned my wrist.  I watched in horror as his crooked half-smile  shrank as I was pulled away.  A hero to the last, that was Edwin.\n\nTonight is the festival of rebirth.  A celebration of my bringing them back to life.  Would we celebrate if they knew I was responsible for their death.   I do not know. \n\n I\u2019m not a hero, not like Edwin.  I doubt I\u2019ll ever tell them.\n",

            "comment": " The dagger shines in the light, gleaming as the moonlight trickles down to the ground. I sheath it back into its holder, the mystical item glowing as always. *Blood dripping silently down my hands.*\n\n  The Earth was always doomed. From the start. Ever since the rise of humanity it was already degrading. While the earth slipped into the cracks of demise, we humans plundered it, not knowing the repercussions. Some argued for us to stop, it was not to late to save the planet, to save humanity from it\u2019s own demise. I was one of those few good people. I told others to listen.\n\n*They did not.*\n\nI run swiftly down the street, eyes darting around, searching for the next person to liberate.\n\n*Or maybe my next victim*\n\n It seems weird, the feeling I mean, of taking a life. The question of morality lingers at the back of my head. \n\n  It all seems surreal, how this happened to me, a simple archaeologist. One day I had a dream, a vision of the dagger. It\u2019s smooth razor sharp edges calling me. On my next expedition, I found it buried underground in a burial room. Ancient runes adorning the walls. I picked up the blade, still sharp after all these years.\n\nThe dagger does something to a person. Does something *otherworldly*, as if the *soul itself is sucked out* and teleported somewhere else. I don\u2019t know where, but I do know it\u2019s somewhere better than earth.\n\n  I don\u2019t have any reassurances, maybe I\u2019ve done all these killings for no purpose, maybe it\u2019s all been in vain, but I *feel* this is the right thing to do. I *know* it is. Humanity must be saved, and that saviour is me. \n\n My footsteps quicken as I hear another person. In this small town on the outskirts of Europe, It\u2019s not hard to find villagers I can save. After the years, I learned to limit the people I brought to the new world. The rich and greedy have nothing to contribute to the new world.\n\n The numbers are a blur. How many have I killed?\n\n*Hundreds?, Thousands? I don\u2019t dare ask myself *\n\n I crawl around the back of one of the houses and peer through the window. I see the man now, late 40s, averagely tall, brown hair with saggy dark eyes. I wonder to myself whether this man has a family, has friends, perhaps children. Perhaps I am unrighteously  taking away his life from them. *Does it even matter?* He seems to be working, and I glance closer. He is sketching, a drawing of a child. I force myself to keep looking. He is turned away from me now, an opportunity which I take. In one swift motion, I climb through the door, unsheathe the dagger, and stab him in the back. \n\n No sound escapes his body. Eerie silence fills the night. The man stays upright for a split second, still conscious.\n\n*A second that echoes into eternity*\n\n The man slumps down. Dead. \nAnother life saved.\n\nThe dagger doesn\u2019t need to kill the person. It sucks the life out of them anyway. That\u2019s how it saves. That\u2019s how I save.\n\n*Saving?, is that what you call the mass genocide you have done?*, The whispers in my head growing louder and louder, like a cyclone of emotions, filling every crack in my mind, until they all stop, and all I hear is deafening silence.\n\nI can\u2019t bear to live with the pain I\u2019ve caused. The lives taken. All I can do is take one more life, one more person. The people on the other side may see me as a hero, but here I am a fugitive. A Criminal. A murderer.\n\n*Maybe the ones I\u2019ve saved don\u2019t even realise I\u2019ve saved them.*\n\nAll these atrocities I\u2019ve done, all the lives lost, are actually lives gained, I try to tell myself. But even though I know I am doing this for good, I still feel in the wrong, ashamed.\n\nWomen and children, saved by my hand,\n\n*Women and children, slaughtered by my blade.*\n\nPerhaps maybe the dagger hasn\u2019t sucked the life out of the ones I\u2019ve killed, but maybe it\u2019s been sucking out *my life*.\n\nI feel the earth tremble, realization  striking me. *\u201dThis must be it\u201d* I whisper silently. The earth was doomed from the start, but perhaps I\u2019ve made my mark on the lives of others, and this world. \n\nI look down on the blade, glimmering in the moonlight. I don\u2019t even know if all I\u2019ve done was worth it. I don\u2019t even know why I did it. It\u2019s all a blur.\n\nBuildings are starting to crumble as the shaking grows more intense. I almost stumble. Pulling out the blade, I prepare for the worst.* \u201cIt\u2019s time\u201d*\n\n\n* I toss it aside*\n\nI bring out the pistol in my holster, and shoot myself hit the head.\n\n\n\n==========================\n\nThis is my first time doing this, comments would be appreciated. \nThanks for reading.",

            "comment": "What would you do if you were going to die in two years? What would *anyone* do?\n\nWhen NASA first released the statement describing the asteroid heading straight for Earth, nobody cared. Well, *some* people cared, the crazy doomsday prophets and homeless people mostly, claiming it's the end of times, God's here to punish us for our sins and so on. But the general population carried on, grabbing selfies with pumpkin spice lattes and retweeting celebrities.\n\nWhen the two nuclear warheads designed to break up the asteroid detonated and failed, people started paying attention. Uneasy jokes about human extinction dominated talk shows, quickly replaced by parodies of political leaders and their sex scandals. An uncomfortable feeling seemed to have seeped into the collective human consciousness, as we begin to doubt our ability to stop the end of the world.\n\nWhen serious scientists predicted Earth had only two years left, we lost it. Everybody seemed to be seized by a need to *do* something. Money became irrelevant. You can't take that with you, after all. Some decided to dedicate their remaining time and fortune into helping take down the asteroid. Others poured their money and life into religion, praying almost continuously for some divine intervention. Most opted for a more... hedonistic approach to the apocalypse.\n\nMe? Well, I have a more disciplined technique. I set about fulfilling my life's purpose.\n\nI found it when I was trekking in the woods, when I was eighteen. A knife, gold and silver, with intricate designs sculpted into its handle, with a small ruby at the hilt. Greek words were carved along the length of the blade, which Google Translate told me meant \"Life is Death.\"\n\nIt stood in the corner of my bedroom, just a cool souvenir from my trip to Yellowstone, for what seemed to be years. But the day we learned Earth was dead, it started whispering. Soft, at first, almost imperceptible.\n\n\"David,\" it had said. \"Help me.\"\n\nI was sure I was going crazy. Knives don't talk, and a asteroid gunning straight for Earth doesn't change that.\n\nI threw it out by the second night. Or at least, I think I did. I don't remember anymore. What I do remember is the knife, sitting stubbornly on the table when I came home from lunch.\n\n\"David. Please.\" It went on for days. He kept muttering my name, calling me. He seemed to grow stronger in darkness, his sweet voice growing louder in the night. I couldn't sleep. How could I, when he was sat at the corner of my bedroom calling me?\n\n\"Please, stop it,\" I begged. \"I just want some fucking sleep.\"\n\n\"We can help stop it,\" the knife said. \"We can help *save* the human race.\"\n\n\"I'm going c-crazy,\" I remember crying. \"I don't want to...\"\n\n\"You're not going crazy,\" he had said. \"Help me. *Feed* me.*\"*\n\nI relented.\n\nThe first person I sent into the knife was Carol. She was a nurse, a sweet, kind-hearted girl who didn't deserve to have to face the end of the world. He promised that if I had killed her, he would steal her soul and protect her. \"A beautiful new world,\" he had said. \"A world free of ash and destruction.\"\n\nI moved so quickly she couldn't even yell in surprise. I plunged the knife deep into her throat. Blood started pouring down her white blouse, and she collapsed into my arms.\n\n\"David - \" she gargled, struggling to speak. Fear seemed to have seized her, I could tell from her eyes. Her face grew paler as life seemed to leave her.\n\n\"It's for your own good,\" I explained, trying not to cry. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nThat was three months ago. I've been hard at work, saving people from the asteroid. I wasn't selective. I didn't discriminate and only saved people who I knew. No, no. Jesus prayed for everyone, even his enemies. The knife was willing to save everybody - short or tall, fat or thin, beautiful or ugly. It didn't matter.\n\nBut if you have helped as many people as I had, it's natural for you to face opposition. People who didn't *believe*, and thought that I was murdering for fun. Don't they see? We are doomed. We are a dead planet living on borrowed time, and I am our only savior. Perhaps they wanted the sweet gift of death as well, and they were just jealous that they hadn't yet been spared from the asteroid. It doesn't matter.\n\nHe was the only thing that mattered. The feeling of warm, wet, sticky blood flowing over my hand as the knife pardoned another. The feeling of watching life fade from their eyes, as they turn from human to corpse.\n\n\"Our journey is at an end,\" he said. I could hear their boots, barreling up the stairs. Their rifles clicking, ready to kill the villain. I chuckled slightly. Aren't they just like me? Killing for protection? Can't they see the irony? Perhaps that is why this world is doomed to fire, I thought. Penance, for crucifying our heroes.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I muttered. I knelt down in my living room, facing the front door. \"I'm sorry I couldn't save more.\"\n\n\"David,\" he whispered. \"Thank you for your service.\" I drove the knife straight into my heart, ready to escape this wretched world. A tightness seemed to crush my chest, as I struggled to breathe. Pain started to spread, like a fire on my nerves. I collapsed on to the floor.\n\nThe door gave way when they swung the battering ram. I saw the first SWAT soldier, clad in full tactical gear burst in through the door. He spread out, allowing more of his brethren to file in. \"Tango is down,\" one of them spoke into the radio. \"I repeat, Tango is down.\"\n\nI closed my eyes, eager to see [the valley beyond.](https://reddit.com/r/soIwroteathing/)",

            "comment": "I'm walking through the woods with my metal detector. My bag of found odds and ends clinking away. I usually go out places looking for things to sell to supplement my living costs as I can't hold down a real job. It also helps pay for my medication. The detector goes nuts so I put it down and pull out my little shovel and start digging. It hits something big on the first hit. I dig the object up carefully in case it's a bomb or other explosive. It's a large Bowie knife. In almost perfect condition. I'm excited as it might be worth something but that stops when I grasp it. The blade starts talking to me. *You must use me. The world is coming to an end soon. War, death and pain everywhere.* I look at the blade and I completely understand. I place the knife in my bag and walk back to the road. I pull out my cellphone and call my mother to tell her I'm done for the day. I wait 15 minutes for her to get there. I open the passenger door and set my bag down on the floor boards and sit in the seat. As I close the door and buckle up she smiles at me and says \"Did you find anything good sweetie?\" I look at her and smile. \"Not really but I had a lot of fun.\" I say. She starts driving and says \"Maybe next time sweetie but at least you had fun. Are you hungry?\" I look ahead at the town and say happily \"Yeah can we get McDonald's?\" She say's \"Yeah what do you want?\" I think a little bit and respond \"Can I have a double cheeseburger?\" She smiles and drives to McDonald's. **30 minutes later.** I sit at home in my room with my knife on my dresser. My mom knocks on my door and says \"Sweetheart it's time to take your night meds.\" I get up and open the door. She hands me my meds and walks away. I go to take my meds but I stop. *Don't take them. We need you awake for the task ahead.* I set the meds on my dresser and grasp the blade. \"But how will using you save people from the pain?\" I ask out loud to the blade. *It will send them to another universe that is free from the fate I have told you about.* I look at the blade. \"Alright.\" I go out to the living room and look at my mom. \"Hey sweetie what are yo-\" she stares at the blade in my hand. Terrified. \"Sweetheart. Put the knife down.\" she stands up and walks slowly towards me reaching out. \"I'm sorry mom. I have to.\" I say before I quickly rush at her slamming the knife into her throat so hard that I hear the vertebrae in her neck shatter. A single year drops down my face as I grab her limp corpse and set her down gently. \"I'm so sorry mom but you'll thank me. I love you.\" I whisper as I close her eyes. I pull the knife blade out gently and wipe the blood off on the carpet. *Now we must get to work. You have to save as many people as possible.* I put the knife in the waist band of my jeans and walk to my room. I open my dresser drawer and grab my key. I make my way out to the backyard and open the shed doors. I unlock the hatch to the upstairs. I climb the pull down ladder up to the top floor. I pull the chain and the lights flicker on. My old hiding spot. Still stocked up. I walk over to the desk and pick up the Mossberg 590 Shockwave and pull the pump on it. Still looks like it works but I need to make sure. **1 hour 26 minutes later.** I finally have everything packed in the car and ready to go. I start the engine and make my way to the middle of town with the blade in the passenger seat. *You are the chosen one. The ones that die by your hands shall be saved from the painful death that awaits everyone else.* I smile to myself. I drive into town and stop in an alley to hide my bags by a dumpster before pulling the car into a parking space in front of the courthouse. I get out and put my hands in the pockets of my coat feeling the remote. I lock the car door and walk away. I make it back to the alley and open the bags. I take off my coat revealing a full military style bullet proof vest equipped with spare magazines. I pull out the Mossberg and pull the sling over my head so the gun rests at my side. I pull out the DB308 and the remote from my discarded coat. I press the button on the remote and am pleased with the loud explosion I hear 3 seconds later. I hear people screaming but I also hear the praise of the ones I just saved. I walk out into the street and start firing indiscriminately at people running towards to explosion. Then I reload and focus my gun on the people staring in a group dumb founded by what is happening. If only they knew that I was saving them, then this wouldn't be so hard. After the streets are clear of people I set my sights on the library. It will be nice to have some intellectuals on the new planet. I walk up to the door and see a horrified man in his early 20's trying to lock the doors. I raise the rifle and pull the trigger. He falls to the ground. Another one saved. *Yes keep going.* I walk through the doors but am immediately greeted with a Glock 17 pointed directly at me. The woman behind the gun opens fire and empties her magazine hitting me twice. Once in the arm forcing me to drop my rifle and once in my thigh sending me to the ground with my gun. I can feel death creeping towards me. *No not like this. You can't die like this.* I tear at the shotgun strap trying to release it. Finally it breaks and I can pull the barrel under my chin. \"I'll be with you my chosen few.\" I say before pulling the trigger. \n\n*Police are saying the mass murder yesterday was the action of one man.*\n\n*30 year old Jeffrey Marcotte is responsible for the deaths of over 60 people including his mother yesterday.*\n\n*Marcotte is said to have been a schizophrenic man.*\n\n*Marcotte's psychologist has stated that he was put on a new medication shortly before this spree and that the change in his medication may be to blame.*",

            "comment": "Lifebringer\u2026 that was the name that I had once called myself in the old world.  People could not catch me, and I had resided myself to my own fate\u2026.\n\nI recall watching television broadcasts of a mysterious strain of murders taking place in the dead of night.  Many involving children under the age of ten.  Each of them, one by one, picked off in their own beds as they slept; all stabbed through the heart.  The youngest was just over two-years old.\n\nPeople were baffled.  I, of course, was not.  I remember looking down upon my hand every night and watching the veins on my arm darken and my skin slowly decaying.  Every time I had taken a life, more and more of the decay claimed my flesh.  I looked down upon my own hand, flexing my fingers, looking upon a strange symbol burned into my skin before I gazed silently at the dagger that always lay just before me on a glass-top table.\n\nIt had all started just a year before when I was given a vision within a dream; a vision I had simply written off as a nightmare.  However, parallels began\u2026  I recall the ever detail that lead up to a horrible war that took place within my dream and ever detail was carrying through.\n\nWhen I resolved myself to realization, I had found the dagger upon that very glass-top table and took it within my hand.  The dagger spoke to me it told me that it was a tool to bring life to those whose blood it drank at the cost of my soul and self.  I could save many, start and new world, at the cost of my very own life\u2026a life doomed to end within a coming war.\n\nIt was a difficult choice, but I took upon that dagger, accepting its brand that would begin the very decaying of my flesh.\n\nI could tell people\u2026warn them\u2026!  Yet, everyone would just consider me insane.  And I resolved myself to save as many as I could: usher them, as chosen ones, unto the new world.  Change would be mortifying for those involved but well worth the cause; that is also why I chose majority numbers of children.  They would grow without much knowledge of the corrupt world wracked with biological warfare that would claim the old.\n\nHowever, I could not just send children.  That\u2019s why I started in small farming communities.  Those deaths were not as sensationalized upon the news as young children.  A missing farmer or two hardly meant a thing to the mass media.  I would have loved to cross some scientists, but I knew that it would be difficult to take anyone that may have security as it would lessen my time.\n\nI did as much as I could, staying secret but\u2026I caught wind that it all may change, and that time was growing shorter for me, so I took off to a small local hospital.  Small it may be, it still had things I lacked: medical personnel.  And more importantly: more children and those who held knowledge of caring for children in the form of a small maternity wing.\n\nThough I knew everything I did was for the good of our civilization to continue, it still pained me to bring the dagger into the chests of the chosen few.\n\nMy time ended there, that day, within the hospital.  The police had come.\n\n\u201cI am the Lifebringer!\u201d I called to them.  \u201cThis would will fall within the week; rains of disease and acid will take you if the mass weapons do not.\u201d I recall the words exactly.\n\nIt was quick and instant.  I had been shot within the leg after refusing to drop the dagger, but I did not reside myself from not, at least, seeing the next world before I die.  I turned the dagger upon myself and drove it deep into my own heart.  The site was that of the weapon splintering into shards of crystal, the fracturing of light caused by the spray of blood and crystal filling my vision as all faded to darkness.\n\nI felt hands upon me as roused from my unconsciousness.\n\n\u201cLook, its another one.\u201d The voice was faint to my ears.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not just one.  That\u2019s the one I told you about.\u201d A female voice replied.  \u201cIt\u2019s the one that sent us here; said something about the end of the world.\u201d\n\nA baby\u2019s wailing cry was shushed as I trained my eyes open and was greeted by a leaf roof built above a strange structure.  The hand that had fallen upon me was of a young man; I didn\u2019t recognize him, and I wouldn\u2019t as I didn\u2019t care to learn the faces of those I would likely never see again.  The man removed his hand as I rose my own hand to gaze upon it, the decay still crept up my arm even as I ushered myself upon the new world by my own hand.\n\nI used every ounce of my energy to sit up where I lay and look around.  A cool breeze blew through the small open-aired building, and I smiled slightly as I gazed upon a vast field of grass before me, a line of trees and a lake within the moderate distance. \n\nIt was beautiful.  Ah\u2026so very beautiful.\n\nPain wracked my side and chest and I looked down upon the center of my chest where the decay now ebbing to the center.  It was time.\n\nSmiling slightly, I allowed myself to fall backwards and lay and mused time and time again of the horror I brought to the world I had just left just for a chance.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d a very faint voice called to me.\n\nI feel tired.  I think I\u2019ll just sleep.\n\n",

            "comment": "*\"Please!\"* She begged, tears in her eyes as her focus shifted between the man before her and the knife in his hand. For a dying and overcrowded world, that particular street was shockingly vacant and poorly lit. She sat in a heap at his feet, her hands and knees littered with shallow cuts, gravel-rash. The man flinched at the pain in her voice, even as the dagger urged him on. It didn't matter how many times he heard people beg, heard and smelt and felt their fear, it still haunted him. Even so, there was a soul in front of him that needed to be saved and he would be the one to save her.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n*Serial killer* that's how they referred to him. He scoffed. He'd had a good run, saved as many as he could. He was tired but there was more work to be done. Law enforcement approached him steadily, surrounding him and yelling. So much yelling. He'd managed to save two, but a dozen officers was too much. One last life and his job would be done. A shot rang out, not the first to bite at him that night but the last. The redemptive knife slid home and his world darkened to black. He had just enough time to fleetingly worry that he'd been wrong about the knife's ability to send it's victims to a healthy, living world.\n\nThe man jolted awake to the raucous cheering of *so many people*. The first thing he saw was a row of stone statues, looming over him, wreathed in flowers. Curiously, one appeared to look like him. As his mind cleared the last of its sleepy fog, he sat up and noted the joyous crowd hollering and watching him eagerly. The crowd swept him up into a celebration. *Hero*. The air was lighter, the water cleaner and the food plentiful. His relief was almost tangible when he realized he had joined the people he'd saved. A new world, so similar to the one they'd been born into, only this one wasn't doomed. The people could live here in peace. One person lingered at the fringes of the festival, eventually curiosity got the better of him and he approached. *Please!* The begging rang clear through his mind. \"Are you going to join in?\" He inquired, gesturing to the exuberant party. The young woman's face twisted into a vicious scowl as he regarded her. \"How dare you save me.\"",

            "comment": "Check.\n\nCheck.\n\nCheck.\n\nChec- oh wait I should leave that person alone since he's the leading cause of the planet's doom.\n\nI make a mental note of the targets I have to kill today and store my list back into my pocket. In the dark of night, I go back to hunting people worthy for survival in the city. People who didn't deserve to die to the wretched plans of the leaders in this world. 2055. That's the deadline. 40 years since geologists have projected there will be reversible effects, yet no one bothered to listen.\n\nThe sky is overcast with clouds made from dust and pollution, like always. My footsteps are silent, and I hide behind obstacles to make sure I am hidden. It will be hard to see anyone in the dark but I have long gotten used to moving like this at night. After all, quick deaths are not always peaceful deaths. I hid behind the wall, listening to the sounds of footsteps.\n\nTwo young ones, one adult.\n\nExhaustion can be seen in their eyes. Most likely refugees moving to a more habitable place to live. Even in the dead of night, she watches around vigilant for anyone nearby. After confirming no one here, she's brings out a commonplace item 40 years back - bottled water. She lets both of them drink their fill of the water, and then takes the bottle back. Although a quarter left remains in the bottle, she paused for a while before reluctantly takes a sip herself, and then quickly put the bottle of water away.\n\nMy dagger slips from my sleeve and onto my hand. After a bit of waiting for their guard to drop, I approach them from behind.It's a little complicated with young ones, so I have to make sure they go with their parents. However, I long have grown accustomed to ambushing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey weren't my targets, but it was enough to see family dynamics. I've seen worse. Blood ties could mean nothing when survival was at stake, but thankfully I won't let that kind of world happen in the next one.\n\nJust another two districts remain. It's going to be a long night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning, the radio in the city went off. There was murmuring, but no panic.\"Have you heard? It turns out it's Another 5,000 deaths today. The mark of the cut shows it's that same serial killer.\"\n\n\"Only that monster can make those knife strokes and leave behind that pattern.\"\n\n\"I'm glad I didn't die. At least it means this district is safe now. Better them than me, haha. Now the living houses here should skyrocket in price. I should buy their houses before others do.\"\n\n\"The leaders aren't even making a move on this killer either. They say less people means more food. Bah, I bet they say that because they were never the target of the killer.\"\n\n\"How are you so sure the killer isn't sent by the leaders? What ordinary human can wipe out a mass number of population so efficiently every day without being caught by the numerous security cameras here?\"\n\nI continued walking down the street, ignoring the murmurs and preparing to finally leave the city for good. I rubbed the heavy bags under my eyes. Indeed. I only hunt once in a district. There's no need to cull them and it reaffirmed my thoughts after hearing the way they speak. All the wild animals have been culled or eaten. The only ones remaining are livestock. In the beginning of my assassinations I would have frowned from hearing such talk, but now it's much simpler to keep my poker face. After all, killing every night until I'm numb physically is very taxing. I make my way out of the city and to the final 'town' left.\n\nThe refugees that aren't allowed inside the town - roughly 300, are the ones who migrated with the 'townsfolk' only to stab them in the back. They sit outside with the trash and bemoaned at the injustice of it all. Of course, they have no one to blame but themselves. They betrayed the townsfolk to get extra provisions only to be betrayed by the leaders when they didn't account for giving them living space at the base. The town itself should number up to 2000. They are the ones ostracized by the leaders in the city. They are also the geologists who set up this small but habitable town and all they wanted was some peace and quiet before their inevitable doom. There aren't much left, but since this is the last habitable base, I'll be done after finishing up today.\n\nI opened my eyes to see myself on the grassland. The sun is shining. A warm breeze blew overhead.\n\nI made it.\n\nThe dagger that has been with me the entire 14 years has started to dissipate into blue specks of light. That's right - it was temporary. It was something that being had given to me, but since it wasn't needed on this world, it's job is done here.  \n\"Thank you for everything... partner,\" I whispered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hey, you there! You're the one who sent us here right?\"\n\nI turned my head around. Before me are all the townsfolk. Behind them was the number of people I killed within my 14 years in the other world and a slightly modernized farmland. I nodded.\n\n\"A killer? More like a saviour!\"\n\n\"Thank you so much!\"\n\n\"I didn't know it was you who was sending us here. I should have realized it since i transported here after greeting you.\"\n\n\"Thank you for the painless transportation.\"\n\nIndeed, the townsfolk were one of the few who I openly slaughtered in daylight without fear of cameras. There was no panic in their eyes of course, everyone was going to meet their end eventually. The townsfolk has already been betrayed once, so they had no fear in their eyes. It was only shortening their death slightly ahead of time. In fact, they rather felt dying a quick death is much better than death by starvation or death by poisonous water. However, they never expected the so-called killer was actually bringing hope rather than despair.\n\nThey hugged me, they cheered, and they lifted me up to meet the many others who I sent ahead of time.\n\nA rice field, vegetable fields, domestication of animals, everything is restarting. Human civilization is beginning anew.But this time, with the world experiencing the closeness of death, the people will not make the same mistake again.\n\nThen sun is shining. A warm breeze blew overhead.\n\nI smiled brightly for the first time in 14 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nBtw, 50 years world ending is a thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "  Is the year 2065 and our blue planet has turned red, poor people kill each other to survive and try to climb or destroy the 36 meters tall wall that separates the poor from the rich. Meteors fall often and destroy what still stands, kill what is still alive, not just that, but all volcanos wakened and every 10 days they erupt, there are no more trees in the planet, making breathing not possible without an oxygen mask that can be purchased but it is really expensive, making poor people dying more frequent than the rich. Inside the wall is not that different, the only difference is they have a shield covering on top, but rumours say it won\u2019t last much more and when it is destroyed they have the same fate.\n\nOne day Mac was wandering inside the wall and came across a cave, he decided to go inside and explore it, after 2 hours of wandering inside, he thought it was best to go back when he noticed a big shine down a path and decided to go there to see what was causing it. For each step he took the brighter it became until he saw a dagger floating on top of a rock with a carved inscription. Mac didn\u2019t know what to do if he returned back so he could tell to someone or if he would take it and save it, what bothered him was the fact that the dagger was floating and had a shine around and the inscription on the rock, he couldn\u2019t read it and didn\u2019t know what civilization the symbols were from so he couldn\u2019t translate from a book. When he was sitting thinking about what to do a sudden voice spoke and he jumped right away asking who was there receiving the answer:\n\n\\- I am Naigra, I was sent to Earth with the duty of killing 10 people and 10 only so they can resurrect on an alternate Earth found in an alternate Universe. \n\nAfter hearing this Mac turned around, but saw no one, maybe he was delusional or he just passed out? A lot of thoughts were crossing his mind about what was happening. Then he heard the voice again and saw a spirit on the dagger, he asked:\n\n\\- Who are you? \u2013 Mac asked.\n\n\\- I am Naigra the spirit that lives within this dagger and gives its power. \u2013 the dagger responded.\n\nMac didn\u2019t know what to do, it seemed even more unrealistic than it was when he found it, he didn\u2019t know what to say but at the same time he had lots of questions. And then he asked:\n\n\\- Why? Why were sent to Earth to kill 10 people? How can they be resurrected? Another Universe? \u2013 Mac asked really nervous but curious to.\n\n\\- There are multiple Universes with different fates, they can be resurrected using my power. I can only resurrect 10 people after that I will be destroyed. \u2013 Naigra explained.\n\n\\- I will give you 5 days to choose 10 people when the time ends up come to meet me here. \u2013 Naigra said while disappearing.\n\nBefore Mac could ask anything Naigra disappeared and the cave became dark again. Was all that a dream? He walked to the exit thinking of what just happened, Mac went home always thinking on the matter. \n\n\\- 10 people\u2026...who? \u2013 Mac thought all evening.\n\n3 days have passed and only 2 left who would he choose? Well, there were not a lot of people left on Earth it should be relatively easy to choose 10 people. In the 5th day Mac went back into the cave, took a deep breath and entered it thinking it was all a dream and that nothing was going to happen, he went to the place where the dagger was and felt relieved when there was nothing but darkness, when Mac was turning around to go away he heard:\n\n\\- Going so soon? You didn\u2019t even told me who the 10 people are yet. \u2013 Naigra said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all a dream it was real it was happening, but why, why Mac?\n\n\\- Why don\u2019t you choose by yourself? \u2013 Mac asked.\n\n\\- I must choose one person to choose the fate of the other 9.\n\n\\- 9? \u2013 Mac asked, confused.\n\n\\- Yes, 9. You are the 10th person. It won\u2019t make a difference to you, it\u2019s even better because you can resurrect. Or\u2026 you rather die on this planet? Its your fate and you can change it.\n\nMac was speechless, it was true, it was a matter of days before the shield break, he would die alongside the rest that were inside and outside of the wall, should he just choose 9 people and die as well so he could resurrect in another alternate Earth?\n\n\\- 9 people you say?\n\n\\- Yes, and you will be the 10th.\n\nAfter a few moments of thought Mac said the names of 9 people 3 residing outside the wall and 6 inside.\n\n\\- What now? \u2013 Mac asked.\n\n\\- Now you take me and kill those 9 people and then you.\n\n\\- WHAT? I never killed no one in my life!\n\n\\- Don\u2019t be afraid, I will be there to help you. And, one more thing I want you to know about this, this 10 people will be resurrected in two different Earths, in one who will become a hero and the other a serial killer. \u2013 Naigra explained the rest of the details.\n\n\\- A serial killer? But why? \u2013 Mac asked.\n\n\\- These are the rules, it\u2019s all I can say.\n\nMac not happy with the answer picked the dagger and started to walk to his new fate of killing 10 people, including him, and in the hope when he resurrected, he would remember this world and could do research about this strange dagger, are there more of these? Where did they came from? So many questions and no answers.",

            "comment": "\"Oh damn! It's Darkblade!\" \n\nThe desk officer's light blue shirt erupted in a fountain of red as the hungry blade whistled in a straight shot that managed to take the neck. It might have looked as if the weapon had missed its target, had it not been for the wake of red that sprayed from the wound. The officer had tried to put pressure onto the wound, but the man was upon him. The blade had already returned to his hand. When the curved tip plunged into the heart, the man with bone-white hair looked upon his victim and said, \"You're welcome.\" He yanked the blade from the chest. His adroit step had managed to dodge the second deluge of red liquid and he was lucky that the desk had served as a buffer to catch any yellow liquid that might have fallen on the merciful killer's boots. His dark eyes narrowed as the limp head struck the desk before the body crashed to the floor. He was in the business of resurrection and blood, but he hated the idea that his work had to be so... messy.\n\nIt had been the third week since the man with bone-white hair took up the blade. His hair had not always been that color, it was a stable dark brown. He (for before he began the work, he was a man) had average looks and average brown hair. Not only had his hair changed, but his figure was also now lithe and skin pale. He could feel a certain sense of confident grace with the way he walked. His eyes had sharpened, their warm walnut color had changed to near black. Though his blade looked like an angry blade, a weapon of hell's arsenal, what was shown to him was anything but. His 'mercies' as he liked to call them were for the better. Even if the other two cops he had come across had dropped to their knees and drawn their weapons.\n\nThe shot had woken his sense of the presence. The shot was near the mark as he felt the hot sting near his forehead. His back was against the wall as he hurled the whispering blade at the shooter's partner. The knife whistled its tune of greetings as it plunged in the thick chest. With a thought, the blade extracted itself in a burst dark red cloud from the chest and returned to his hand.\n\n\"You won't get away with this, murderer!\" The officer shouted before he fired twice more, \"You think you can just cut your way through the world?\"\n\n\"I'm here to collect what I can. I could make this painless if you would just stop shooting at me.\"\n\n\"And let you get close to stab me? Go to hell!\" The cop replied with both words and a shot that sent splinters of wood in the air.\n\nThe man blinked when he heard the officer swear, followed by the soft metal clink. He knew that sound, a revolver chamber had been lowered. He kicked off the wall and rounded the corner. As he burst into the wider office he saw a large gray conference table in the shape of an oval, a pair of cubicles in the towards the bricks made of frosted transparent material. Behind him were another pair of cubicles and a raised dais where a fifth desk lorded above the others in the room. There was an officer alone, dressed in blue with a cap laid on the table. He had one round the chamber when the man had leaped belly first on to the table, slid across, and plunged the blackened metal right between the officer's eyes. The bone haired man neither smiled or frowned at his work. He was but a pawn of dagger's whispers, \"Be reborn on the other side, friend. Receive my master's mercy.\" He yanked the blade and tilted his head to avoid the spray. Another soul saved before the storm that would exterminate both the world and soul.\n\n\"Hey! Hey! What's going on in there? Let us out!\" A voice cried from the door ahead of the man. He rolled off the table and stood. The tail of his long coat trailed behind him. The knife was not content to giving him the dark eyes and sunken features of death's agent. It had given him clothes of black or dark gray with an oyster gray coat. He had one hand in his pocket where he drew a handkerchief to clean the hungry blade. His lips pursed as he heard someone cry out.\n\n\"Can one of you guys check on us?\" The voice said.\n\nHe could tell by the words and the sight of bars that ahead of him were prisoners. Despite a deep sense of elation at more souls to shower with the knife's mercy, he also had to learn of their hearts. The wicked did not need to be reborn and he had other ways to spare people from the coming storm, such as fire.",

We're supposed to protect the people from monsters and magic in this reality, where such things have became public!\"\n\n\"And look where it got you!\" the dagger taunted. \"Your friends, dead. Your precious Council, who abandoned you, for you killed seven of your mentors.\"\n\n\"All because YOU made me!\" I screamed at it. \"You promised me I'd bring them back! If I sacrificed the souls of those who told us we could retrieve you.\"\n\nIf the dagger has a body, no doubt it's smiling. \"It is justice. They sent you to die! It is only right for them to meet their ends, by YOUR hands. You only have one more...\"\n\nI look at it. One more... one more and this can end. And this person I have to kill--I bring out my smartphone and call her.\n\nWithin an hour, my mentor shows up at the first floor of the restaurant I own. The chairs and tables are nearly patterned about the place, devoid of people. After all, who'd want to eat at some restaurant owned by the niece of Mr. Lee, the former \"Flower of Mr. Lee\", who was driven mad by loss, forced to kill members of the Council, one by one?\n\nHowever, the girl in front of me... she never gave up on me. She has blue and white hair, tied to a bun. She has a lean body, her round, smooth face, medium sized eyes, and pudgy nose looking at me with at warm smile. She has a sword strapped to my book.\n\n\"Ye Seul-ssi!\" Eunice says. Then her smile falters. \"I undrstand your loss and why you did... what you did. However, I can't let you go. Come with me, face the Council, and we can make it work!\"\n\nI nod at her. She smiles and puts a hand on my shoulder. Then... her face turns to that of horror. She chokes, looking at me, shaking. Her eyes are shaking, like they are trying to find out why things turned out like this.\n\nBlood on the floor. Blood on my hands. The broken body of someone I once revered as a sister.\n\nAnd yet... I feel nothing. I've killed so many that I feel nothing. The dagger shines.\n\nIt says to me, \"The deed is done and you have paid your price. Your friends shall live... in another reality!!\"\n\nI look down at it, my hands shaking in fury. \"Wait, but that wasn't part of the deal!\"\n\n\"Foolish child,\" it said. \"If I said everything, you wouldn't have done what you've done. They will live happily in another reality. As will you, as soon as you pay another price.\"\n\nI stare at it. \"What price...?\"\n\n\"Your life. Not to worry you shall revive! In another reality. However, you won't recall any memories of your time with them in this reality... you will start fresh. As is the price of living from one realm to the other.\"\n\nThen I feel my arms, pushing deeper to my gut. I can't control it! I whimper, my eyes shaking. I can't control my body! At the end... I gave up. I feel the stinging sensation of the blade, entering my gut. I crumple to the floor, my vision blurring.\n\nBlur.\n\nBlur.\n\nDarkness.\n\nI hope... that I get reborn in that reality, where we are to be revered as heroes for generations to come... without turning to darkness...\n\n\nAnother reality... San Magos, CA\n\nA monster gurgles blood as it crumples to the floor, dead. I sheathed my sword as my friends, inhale and exhale.\n\n\"Goddamn!\" Jackson says. \"That was a hassle!\"\n\n\"Psh, it wasn't THAT hard,\" Cassandra punches him in the gut.\n\n\"OW!\" he cries.\n\nEmma puts her gloves on, the electricity dying around her. \"Good job, everyone!\"\n\nAn applause from the bystanders. We all scratch our heads. Yuuki hides from embarrassment, but become confident as soon as Kaya holds her hand.\n\nI smile at my team and the town we swore to protect. I can't imagine what it'd be like... if I lost them forever.\n ",

            "comment": "I looked down at the paper in my hand and sighed.  My mission, as the visions had explained, was to save humanity.  The problem was that to save humanity, I had to kill them.   Personally.  Strapped to my side was a dagger made of a material I could not identify.   It felt like stone, but was as resilient as the hardest of metal alloy man could produce.  With this dagger, I could kill a person, and save them.  Doesn't make a bit of sense, really, but I knew in my heart, it was true.  The visions, or messages, or whatever you wanted to call them were definitely real, and what I had seem in them had shaken me to my very core.  Oh, yeah, that's the other big thing you should know, I'm the only one in the world that knows that the Earth and all it's people are doomed.  What a nice burden to have, don't you think?  It's a ton of fun I tell you.  Oh, the dagger, you probably want to know how I got it and how I started to get the visions.  It's a short tale, since it happened all at once.\n\nOn a day like any other, I got a ring at the door, and barely caught the sight of the delivery guy jumping into his van and speeding off.  He had placed box not unlike those your shoes come in on my doorstep.  I didn't remember anything I had scheduled for delivery recently so I read the label carefully.  It was hand written, clearly listed me as the recipient, and was from someone who was an old acquaintance, a martial arts trainer I had worked with some years ago.  My curiosity was peaked and I cut the box open there on my doorstep with a small knife I had on my key ring.  Inside, a piece of paper sat atop something wrapped in some sort of silk cloth.  I read it and it said simply: \"You are the only person I could think of that was worthy to have this.\"  My curiosity grew tenfold and I quickly unwrapped the object and saw this awesome dagger that looked like it was a prop from the Lord of the Rings, except it was milky white.  I grabbed the thing and at that point I guess I passed out and drooled allover myself on my door step as the next thing I knew I was being awoken by a neighbors dog as it licked my face, much to the chagrin of my neighbor who had spotted me.  I told him I was fine and probably fainted from lack of sleep.  That was of course a lie.  I had been awake, just awake somewhere *else*.\n\nSo yeah, that's the short of it.  I passed out in front of my house and had a vision of the world ending and how I could save humanity.  By killing them.  Oddly enough the visions didn't tell my who I should kill.  They sort of said I would know who naturally.  As you could imagine, this drove me a bit crazy at first, but I think I have it figured out.  This list in my hand, it's a very particular list.  See, I don't have a lot of time to save humanity, a few years at most.  A few years to plan the careful murder of some very notable people.  People like this man in front of me.\n\n\"Hello doctor!  I'm a huge fan of your theories.  It's an honor to meet you!\" I said with my best fan-boy enthusiasm I could muster.  You see, I had decided the people I needed to save should be the best humanity had to offer.",

All of the pain and suffering I had experienced until that moment was finally given meaning and I was granted purpose and hope for the future for the first time in my life. I wish I had known. How could I have known?\n\nI was told it would be easy after the first. It was. It was so easy. To know you were granting someone a chance experience life away from this wretched planet we had created for ourselves in a delerious greedy haze of consumption. We didn't know it would lead to this, but how could we have known? We now had a chance to start off with this knowledge and I had the power and authority to grant people that opportunity. It was the children I wanted to save first. So full of Hope and possibility. I was doing great work and I was rewarded with a sense of honor and riteousness for the work I was doing was more important than all human accomplishment before me. There was no way I could have known. If only I had known.\n\nHave you ever been disillusioned before? Not like \"Santa isn't real\" or \"God doesn't exits\". Like real, deep disillusionment. Like soul-piercing disillusionment. Like leaving a cult that created murderers out of the desperate to find yourself split between two worlds. In one world you are a hero. The souls of the saved are free from the inevitable fate they would face on a dieing world. In the other, the one outside your solipsistic womb, the real, the actual, the world; you are a murderer.\n\nI know now. I wish I didn't. ",

            "comment": "Earth was doomed but the dagger in my hands could be humanities salvation. Well the salvation of an super tiny fraction of its population. I had what? Three years? Somewhat over a thousand days? I would have to stab ten people a day to get into 5 digits. But still saving thousands was saving thousands even if it was out of billions.\n\nI sat in my dark living room looking out at the thousands of tiny lights of a cities skyline. Each a person or a family doomed to die in three years if I didn't stab them with a fucking dagger.\n\nI turned the dagger in my hands, it was a pretty thing looking more suited for something ceremonial than fighting. But then murdering people in alleyways was a dead end anyway. There is no way I would reach even a hundred people without get caught. And if I ran from the police and a bullet killed me I wouldn't even be able to enter the new world myself. \n\nMaybe I convince other of its purpose, maybe I could get the public to believe me, maybe they would line up in orderly rows, a new one stepping forward each time one fell and was whisked away by helpers, so that I had to do nothing beside stab and stab and stab until they were all dead.\n\nIt could happen I suppose. In the first night after I picked it up, the dagger gave me knowledge through vivid dreams that didn't fade after waking up  maybe I could get it to give the same to others. Convince some journalist that way, and they might get me into contact with politicians and spread the message. Once it hit critical mass I probably wouldn't even have to do anything myself, they would choose someone else as executioner and it would be out of my hand. Maybe I would offer to be the first to die to demonstrate my believe in the dagger.\n\nIt could happen, but I didn't actually know how to make the dagger do that. I knew how to choose a successor, alas the process was not suitable to recruit followers. Without that could I convince anyone? People would just think I was hallucinating . Maybe some would come out of desperation but without public acceptance the police would stop me. But there was some magic in this world, maybe I could find someone with the knowledge to make the dagger spread its message.\n\nI wanted to curse the being who gave me the dagger but a pitiful chance to save some of us is still better than none I suppose. My phone chimed reminding me that I only had fifteen minutes until my brother was here. He was smart and brave and if I just told him about this I am sure he would believe me and do his best to support me. He probably had a much better idea what too do than I did. Why did I get this blade anyway? It is not like I was someone special...\n\nI studied the blade one last time. And then? I killed myself.\n\nOf course I left my brother a note near the front door, some personal, some half formed ideas for what you could do with the dagger. I won't tell you all about it but I suppose you deserve to know part of. \n\n\"[\u2026]And again I am truly sorry for leaving you behind to deal with this, but the responsibility was simply to great for me. Don't grieve my death remember I am not truly dead just the first to escape to another world. Instead curse me for leaving you with the burden and having the time of my life in another world. I truly believe you will do a better job than I could ever have done but if it gets too much I certainly won't blame you for choosing the same escape I did. And remember if your life is ever in real danger kill yourself with the dagger, I expect to see you here sometime during the next three years. No matter how many you save you must save yourself too.\n\nAlso don't touch the dagger yet, you are already its next carrier so it will return to you when you call it even if the police took it as evidence. And remember to hide this one, the other suicide note should be enough to convince them it was suicide.\n\nI have another idea, maybe if you get someone important to at least listen you can tell them you will pick a person of their choice as successor and if that person suddenly believes after you die, risky but it just might be enough\u2026 \n\n\u2026I am an idiot aren't I? You know just pick the president of the USA as successor and follow me immediately. I am half tempted to to do it myself now but then how could I be sure you would ever get to follow me? \n\nWell if you don't find anything wrong with that plan I expect you to follow me soon. Be safe.\n\n[\u2026]\n\"\n\n--------\nThe boring predictable ending for a scenario like this I suppose.",

            "comment": "(outside perspective)\n\n*Sparky Ralst was just found dead. His throat was slashed and his heart was stabbed, characteristic signs of the Lionview Killer. It seems he has finally made it into Grandston, locals need to lock their doors and report any suspicious activity to Grandston law enforcement...*\n\nHayden sighed and turned off the television. The Lionview Killer had traveled a thousand miles all the way to his town of Grandston, murdering all the while.\n\nAll of those killed had been pure of heart and soul. Most had been famous for their work in therapy, search and rescue, the military, hospitals, or other great things. Some had simply been great friends of everyone in town, which is just as bad of a loss. \n\nAll of those who died had been of strict benefit to society, and it made Hayden furious to think this killer was trying - and succeeding - to take the good out of the world. \n\nHayden had never been the purest of people, he probably would've been rooting for the killer if he targeted those that needed to be eradicated - pedophiles, rapists, those sort. A good vigilante would probably be someone he would stand behind - silently of course. But this? Good souls being stripped from the earth? It made him sick.\n\nSitting up and folding down the recliner, Hayden pushed himself to his feet. He needed to get up and do something to get his mind off of the fact that a murderer was now present in his quiet friendly neighborhood. \n\n\"Ralphie! C'mere boy, let's go for a walk.\" He said, smiling as he heard his best friend's nails scrabble against the hardwood floor as soon as \"walk\" left his mouth. It was half a second later that Hayden saw the giant paws of a gangly, disproportionate mutt galloping at him from around the corner. \n\nHayden patted him on the head and clipped the leash to his collar, \"Alright boy, let's get some fresh--\" \n\n*CRACK! BANG!*\n\nThe loud noise was immediately recognized as his back door breaking at the lock and slamming open. Hayden turned around just in time to see the silhouette of a hooded figure and a streak of irridescent purple twirl through the air, where it thudded dully against Ralphie's chest. The goofy, loving mutt fell to the floor without a sound. \n\nA look of horror spread across Hayden's face as he turned to watch numbly as the hooded figure advanced on him and his fallen dog. The description of the brief sightings matched everything. This was the Lionview Killer.\n\nAnger ran hot through Hayden's veins as he lunged towards the hooded figure with blind rage. How dare he come into his home! How dare he hurt Ralphie! \n\nAn animalistic roar tore through his throat as he went to grab the slim figure and throw his head into the hardwood floor Ralphie's claws had been scrabbling moments before. \n\nThe killer dodged easily, movements as fluid as water, and reached down silently to grab the dagger from the chest of the dog. Blood poured from the wound as the killer went to finish it with the slash across the throat - his signature. \n\nHayden spun around, \"Oh no, you're not getting away, and don't you touch him!\" Fury gave Hayden's large form speed as he barreled into the hooded figure. \n\nHe hit the guy and a startled grunt came from him. They rolled on the floor briefly and Hayden grabbed hold of the irridescent purple knife. \"Here! TAKE SOME OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE!\"\n\nAnd he was arcing the knife through the sky, down towards the murderer. \n\nBut Hayden had no combat training. He had no skills other than the mostly fat and some muscle that lent him an advantage against the slight and thin form of the hooded figure, and the Lionview Killer obviously knew his way around a knife. \n\nIt was stripped from Hayden's hand mid motion, and while the killer didn't try to turn the knife onto Hayden, they fell clumsily in a heap and Hayden felt a sharp stitch of pain right below his ribs.\n\nGasping, he rolled off and saw the knife protruding at an angle from his chest, stabbing directly towards his heart. Hayden felt his breath hitch in his throat. He couldn't  breathe. \n\nHe was wide-eyed, shocked, and dying in a pool of his dogs blood.\n\nThe Lionview Killer was cursing under his breath, angry and frantic as he tried to think of a way Hayden could be saved from this. Think of a way everything wouldn't be ruined. But no, the angle of the knife was obvious, Hayden would die. The killer had been sloppy, and it cost him all of his plans. \n\nHe yanked the knife from Hayden's body and began to clean it, shaking his head with disappointment. \n\nJust before Hayden's last breath, he croaked, \"Why? Why are you doing this?\"\n\nThe Lionview Killer looked down at his pathetic, dying body and sighed, \"You'll see soon enough.\"\n\nEverything went black for Hayden, but he was quick to feel consciousness again as sunlight shone on his eyelids. He opened them, surprised to see he was completely healed, surprisingly fit, and laying on a bed of luscious green grass.\n\nHefting himself up on his elbows, he looked around and saw the most magnificent thing.\n\nDogs of all shapes and sizes frolicking, playing, napping, woofing. A few looked at him and tilted their head, as if they werent expecting to see him. A few wagged their tails in his direction. A couple approached him and gave him a good sniff and a lick before heading off. \n\nAnd then Hayden saw him. His gangly, goofy good-boy. \"Ralphie!!\"\n\nHe hugged his dog as Ralphie tackled him, and decided this was the sort of world he could live happily in. ",

            "comment": "It all started with a fortune teller on international TV.\n\nApparently she'd made some crazy claims, like, abnormally crazy. But people decided to finally listen to her after her 50-something-th correct prediction in a row, and good thing it was now too.\n\nThe prediction this time was for global apocalypse. She described a vast, stretching and totally barren wasteland, with no warmth or happiness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently this idea was romantic enough to send the whole world into a frenzy, with people trying to find a way to slow it down, even stop it entirely. No one was sane anymore and society fell apart fast, it even looked like everyone would kill each other before this so called 'apocalypse' at one point.\n\nIt was at that point that I found it, I knew this was humanity's last chance and that it was my responsibility to give it to them. The knife which sent people to the other side, a sort of 'eden' to contrast the approaching armageddon, the only way to save them. Except, no one would believe me. Why would they? The end of the world is coming and the one who convinced us it was is now saying there's no hope, people are making the best out of the lives they have left, which made my job easier than it should have been.\n\nI killed 12 in the first day, my conscience couldn't handle the idea of killing others, even if it's for their own good. I threw up 7 times that day and, at one point, I was so weak from the shock that one of my targets actually overpowered me and ran away.\n\nIt didn't take long to get easier, after the first week I was working through 30 people a day, and I just became more proficient after each one. After a while I'd cleared out the town I was in at the time, I became a wandering hermit of sorts. Moving from town to town, only leaving once I'd cleared out the area. I'd take some supplies and move on to the next town, quietly and efficiently\n\nI started learning to scope out the people I saved for a little while, it made the actual event easier and quicker. People rarely acted out of suit for this new culture we'd built ourselves, but after a while, I'd noticed something had changed. People were smiling again, and not like the fake smiles they put on because they didn't know what else to do, the looked normal. A few towns over from that realisation I noticed a postman, a real postman doing a real job. I thought nothing of it at the time, simply people holding to old traditions and trying to jump-start society again, despite how meaningless it is.\n\nI moved between places so quickly at this point I barely even cared to look at my surroundings, I had internalised my process to such a level that I rarely even had to think anymore. All that kept me going was the promise that I would save them all, and then join them on the other side.\n\nIt came as a surprise, then, when I realised that I was currently following the last two humans on earth. My pace picked up and I slammed into the man's back and sent my dagger through the back of his neck, I stood up and turned to the woman only to pause for just long enough for her to get out of reach. It was the fortune teller, she'd been alive all this time, running from me.\n\nShe didn't say anything as my knife plunged into her chest and she slumped to the floor. I just stood there, shocked. Shocked that it was all over, that they were finally all saved. The haze in my mind lifted as I looked up to the world for the first time in years.\n\nWhat I saw was a vast, stretching and totally barren wasteland, with no warmth or happiness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst time trying something like this and I don't write really either, let me know what you thought!",

            "comment": "This is it the end is near... Can you do it?? Do what? I muttered as the man who is shrouded in shadow hands me a curved object wrapped in silk . He looks at me as if he is judging me from head to toe I can feel his eyes analyze me inch my inch. For a full minute I stand their quietly till he States in a harsher voice , \" you must kill those who you love first, the world won't understand but you will once your soul is tied to the artifact\".  I begin to realize a sense a regret in the man's voice like he has felt this power and rejected it's responsibility. He begins to walk away and only yells back, \" kill to save boy you'll get good at just don't get caught \" . Confused and mortified I go home instantly. \n\nWho the hell did I just talk too and why me ? I look in my backpack and pull out the object given to me. I unwrap the black silk that hugged the object tight only to unveil a beautiful dagger of sorts. The handle was pure gold with a gem that sat at the very end that shined intense blue. The blade was clean and with inscriptions running up and down the blade on both sides. As I picked the dagger up and held it for the first time I felt strange. All of sudden the world around me changes. I see it in the future earths final days are soon and the dagger is the key to survival. Suddenly I see the importance of the mysterious man's words \"kill to save\". I get up and instantly go to my parents. \"How do I tell them that I have to kill them so they can wake up saved?\" I open their door to see both of them lying in bed but awake each doing their own thing. \n\n\"Come in dear\" my mom says in her gentle voice. \"What do have there, my dad says as he points to the dagger. I begin to feel it my heart raising sweat drips Down my brow. Do I tell them or just do it and explain later? How can I kill 7 billion people ? How do I have the world if I have to watch the ones I love die first ? My mind is raising. My parents watch me with curiousity and fear. My dad gets up and moves towards me slowly. \"Son what's going talk to me\" he says in a concerned voice. He comes within 3 feet of me and is waiting for a response. I look up from the ground with tears down my face, \" dad I .. I. Love you both of you\" he looks at and begins to State,\" I love yo....\" I cut his throat with a swift motion. My mother screams and begins to run as I crumple to my knees and watch my fathers last gurgled breath leave his body. I cry and tell him that I will see him soon. I get up and look for my mother, \" mom I can explain I yelled please just listen \" my mother is hiding in a closet just down the hall I find her clutching her phone as she looks at and says \" I called the police why are you doing this?\" Her voice is Shakey as tears streak down her face. I look at and say I did it because the dagger told me too. I can't take my mother's life I look at her,\" I'm sorry and I love you Mom take the dagger after I'm gone and save yourself\" my mom looks confused as I take the dagger and cut my throat.....",

            "comment": "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the bastard this time.\u201d Agent Ray Marsh didn\u2019t bother to hide the venom in his voice. In was the only sound besides the static of the CCTV. His knuckles were white as he clung to the chair and stared hard at the monitor. I don\u2019t think he even sees me, all of his attention is on the cursor hovering over the play button. It\u2019s more of a grimace than a smile plays over his face, \u201cThis time, Laura, this time we\u2019ll get a face.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you find it strange?\u201d I need to ask the question before we begin.  \n\nHe glances at me reluctantly, \u201cLaura, what are you bullshitting about?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Special Agent Smith to you.\u201d I scoff at him, \u201cI\u2019m bullshitting about the fact that after 3 years and 532 linked murders there is finally a slip up. Not a little one either but full video coverage and you don\u2019t find it strange?\u201d\n\nThe fan in the closet sized roll actually makes it several rotations before Marsh responds. He shoves out the his square stubborn jaw, \u201cYes but this whole bloody case is strange. What type of killer constantly is able to stab his victims in the throat? Mind you that\u2019s with no defensive wounds and the victims are not weak but strong ambled bodied men and women. Hell this last guy got a damn Olympic medal. So yeah, it\u2019s all very strange but, now, it can all make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay Marsh.\u201d My voice is steady but my pulse is pounding in my ears as I click the play button, \u201cLet\u2019s make some sense.\u201d\n\nThe video starts and show the inside of Mike Gordon\u2019s apartment. The former Olympian had a flat covered in white: white wallpaper, white bear skin rugs, white piano, white couches, and in the center of it all a white table. At that table Mike sat. His face was clearly visible on the screen and he was laughing. Across from him was a short figure in a hoodie but they\u2019re not facing the camera and the face isn\u2019t visible. In between them on the table is small dagger with a red handle. \n\nThere is a bit of audio from the camera microphone but it\u2019s distorted, the voice sound practically robotic. Mike leans back in his chair and scornfully looks at the stranger, \u2018You\u2019re saying I have a choice?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.\u2019 A shiver runs down my spine, the voice is soft and scratchy on the audio. I glance at Marsh to gauge his reaction. He just stares at the screen.\n\nMike picks up the dagger and examines the blade. He weighs it in his hands before questioning the killer, \u2018What if I don\u2019t do it? What if I walk away right now and call the cops? I hear they\u2019ve been looking for you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Then you damn yourself and ever other living breathing human being on this planet.\u2019\n\nThe Olympian points it at his killer, \u2018What if I don\u2019t believe you?\u201d\n\n\u2018You could but you won\u2019t because deep down you know I\u2019m right.\u2019 The hooded figure leans forward in their seat and crosses their hands in front of them, \u2018Because you know it\u2019s your turn and you can feel Utopia calling.\u2019\n\nThere is something in Mike that changes. He joking demeanor becomes more sullen and quite. In a flash he reaches across the table and grabs his killer by their jacket. They don\u2019t struggle as he holds the knife to their throat,  \u2018I could kill you right now and end this cycle of violence.\u2019\n\n\u2018You could but you won\u2019t. It\u2019s not my turn.\u2019\n\nThere is a tense moment before Mike lets the killer go. Instead he stares back at them with a sort of resignation. Then he looks at the knife, \u2018I know. Somehow....I know.\u201d In one rapid motion Mike Gordon turns the blade and stabs himself in the throat. \n\nI can hear Marsh tensing as the man rips the blade from his own throat and the blood spays across the white flat: White and red wallpaper, white and red bear skin rugs, white and red piano, white and red couches, white and red table, white and red Mike falls the the floor. The hooded figure stands and walks to the body. They lean over and pull the knife from the man\u2019s throat. \n\nThen they turn around and look straight at the camera. I can see Marsh putting it together. Slowly he recognizes the killer in the video and in horror I see him turn to me. I\u2019ve already put the knife on the coffee stained wooden table between us. The small red handle vibrates on the surface.\n\nHe looks from the knife back at me. I look at him with sympathy, \u201cRay, you have a choice to make.\u201d",

            "comment": "The roar from the megaphone was getting tiresome. \"Once again, if you come out peacefully, we can talk about this. But if you leave me with another dead body to take down to the morgue, I am gonna make your life a living hell, son.\"\n\nI really hated the way Lt. Parsons called anyone younger then 45 \"son\", like it wasn't weird or stupid. His condescension was what did it. While I'd long since had enough of his ranting, that paternalizing tone was something I just couldn't take anymore, so I put the knife up against my throat and cut deep. \n\nDespite all the duct tape holding the hilt to my right hand, I gripped my fingers tight around it anyway. I couldn't ever take a chance of losing it.\n\n**-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-***-*-*-*-*--*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*\n\nAfter the world went black, I awoke inside an brightly lit apartment building made of sturdier material than the one I'd left behind. I'd been told what the substance was dozens if not hundreds of time before, but I could never quite recall the name. I was on the floor of a bed room and could see the shape of a sleeping woman underneath the covers. I tentatively called out \"Hello?\"\n\nThere was a stirring and I heard a woman's voice mutter something. Then I heard another woman respond with a muttered something. I saw a head pop up and there was a blonde woman holding a sheet over her breasts. The brunette closer to me turned her head and opened her eyes.\n\nThe shrieked in shock, then squealed with delight. As they were babbling in that hard to understand dialect so common to the other world, my mind started to slowly acclimate to their bizarre manner of speaking. \"You === the jump person ===+= giver life\".\n\nAfter a half hour of touch and go conversation, I was able to talk with them sensibly. \"So, can we take it from the top?\"\n\nThe blonde, who'd changed into a set of pantaloons and a man's shirt before handing me some fancy pajamas out of her closet nodded. \"Yes. We are honored to have you in our home Mr. Parrid. It's quite a shock to meet such a larger than life figure.\"\n\nThe brunette chuckled \"Save the honeyed words Becca. This guy's notorious for feeling awkward under too much praise. At least,\" she turned to me \"that's if the interviews I've read are true?\" I nodded. \"So, anyway, my understanding, is that when you show up here you check in with the feds and they take you to a place to relax, recuperate and plan your next rescue mission.\"\n\nSipping my coffee I nodded. \"Yeah, so if you'll let me borrow a phone, I can make some calls and be on my way.\"\n\nAs the brunette nodded the blonde interrupted \"Hold up Layla, I gotta ask him some questions!\"\n\n\"Becca, don't be rude, you can ask him stuff after he's made his calls.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"It's cool. I can answer a question or two before I make the calls.\"\n\n\"I'll just give you one, the one I've been wondering for ages.\" I motioned for her to go on. \"So if stabbing someone with the knife sends them from one world to the other, why haven't you ever stabbed someone who came from the \"older world\" so they can go back and confirm what's going on? Seems like it'd make things easier.\"\n\nI sighed. \"I wish it worked that way, but it doesn't. I'm the only person the knife can send back to the older world. For any other person here... it's just a knife... at least so far as I know. It may or may not send them to another world from here, but it doesn't send them back to mine.\"\n\nBecca nodded. \"I'm guessing... you... know that from...\"\n\n\"It was verified a couple of times. All volunteers, all sick with terminal or debilitating illnesses. After the 5th subject didn't end up in the older world, I made them stop the tests. I just... I couldn't stomach doing it again. It's hard enough to send people to do that to people back home, even knowing I'm sending them to a paradise\" I saw a gloomy look cross Layla's face at the word paradise \"doing it to someone who might just be fading away altogether... it's more than I can bear.\"\n\n\n*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*\n\nLayla walked me down the stairs while Becca went back to her bedroom to try to get some sleep. Apparently she had a work shift at a graveyard that she'd need to be well rested for. As we walked down the multiple flights of stairs (I was still leery of the moving box rooms that lift and descend through buildings) I inquired about her odd expression when I was talking earlier.\n\n\"Listen Mr. Parrid...\"\n\n\"Please, call me Ronald.\"\n\n\"Okay, Ronald... I know your \"older\" world is a hellish place to live, but it still feels weird hearing this world called a 'paradise', because it's really not. We've got wars, poverty, massive oppression, or governments are being co-opted by fascists all over the globe, and our massive industrial based system is destroying this place. Hell, our own scientists are talking about how we might only have another decade or so before the planet's climate is too fucked to fix anything. I've read so many of the horror stories of people that have come here, but it's... I'm worried that this society being so much less worse than the one they're fleeing is making it harder to get people to focus on improving this one.\"\n\nI nodded. \"I think I see your point. I mean, sure, it's not untrue that you and your missus would be thrown into a prison work shop for what you do behind closed doors, but that doesn't mean you're living on easy street out here. From what a fellow was telling me the last time I came back, it's only been a few years that your government's even given legal validity to your marriage. I was in a hotel awhile back watching some so called \"man of god\" ranting and raving about how the people coming from the older world are throwing things here out of balance, and how folks doing as they like, instead of as he wants are ruining society... it wasn't all that different from the hateful crap ministers of the questioning brigade shout about back home... but I have to believe, that people shown a better world than the one they've left behind will realize that they can keep improving that world, that having seen how much worse things can be, they won't settle for less when they know there can be more.\"\n\nShe smiled and reached out her arms. I held mine out and gave her a hug.\n\n-*-*-*-*-*-*\n\nTwo months later I entered a warehouse and stabbed myself in the neck. When I awoke in the echo of the warehouse, there was a set of glass walls all around me. On the other side of that glass was Lt. Parsons holding his mini-musket. \"Stay where you are Parrid, or I'll shoot you clean through the head. Even if you cut yerself again, you won't bleed out quicker'n I can end your life in such a way that you might not ever trouble me again.\"\n\nRealizing there was no way out of this, I shrugged. \"Alright Parsons. Go ahead and take me into custody then. I give up. I won't even resist.\"\n\n\"Would that it were such a simple thing. Not all that long ago, I'd have done just that... but now I can't.\"\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Because Mr. Parrid, I've seen you materialize out of thin air with my own two eyes. That puts me over a line I didn't ever like thinking was really in the sand. All those years of reading your letters of statements from people you'd 'sent over' and confirming details. All those years of talking with that crazy alchemist about his various schemes to track you down and his talk of 'strange energy emissions'. All the rooms full of scientists arguing over the validity of the dozens of corpses you've left for me. All of those things, I could ignore while focusing on doing my duty and letting men far above my station sort things out once I'd brought you to justice. This? Seeing a man slowly appear as if from nothing? That's one step too far. That's me knowing that you're really on the up and up. That's me knowing that I've got to swallow my pride and my sense of duty and my honor and possibly the very state of my immortal soul. That's me having to put aside nearly every value I hold dear and beg you for a favor.\"\n\nI waited. It felt like pushing him to ask whatever he was going to ask would be the wrong move. So I stood there, looking into his eyes as he looked into mine. It felt like half of forever and not the good half.\n\n\"My son. He's always been sickly, but this past year or so, he was doing better. Then a couple weeks ago he started coughing and kept coughing. When his hankerchief ended up with bloodstains I feared the worst. When he came back from the doctor's office, those fears were made manifest. He's got consumption. There's nothing I can do to stop it, nothing the doctors can do... but maybe in that \"younger world\" you keep talking about... maybe they can do something.\" His eyes narrowed as he looked into mine. \"Will you help me Parrid?\"\n\nThe instant nod of 'yes' that I gave him, would end up changing to the course of history on two worlds.",

            "comment": "GODDAMMIT\nHow did it come to this..\nI've been doing so much for so long...\nFucking Keaney, Jared, Annie.. I \"killed\" my friends and family for this. They never understood. Each and everyone I tried to explain it to just screamed and tried dot get away. Chasing down my loved ones... their screams.. God it's such a viscerally draining experience. It's almost making it easier as I go, the nerves being fried from the same adrenaline, the ears ringing, the deadpan stare I put up so they dont see the fear and pain in my face. I only hope they actually know what's going on when they get there. That I'm doing this for them, to help them, to save them. It's because I love them. Fuck I do it to each and every person I possibly can because I love them all I want them to be saved. It feels fitting that I'm the one to do it. I've always had those intrusicely violent and unsettling thoughts. I've always loved and identified with the tragic hero, misunderstood and standing his ground. Like a stoic Captain America in his Civil War. But my war was not a civil one. It first came in a dream, a picture of fire and an echo of screams. Grand explosions through the horizon and great beasts of fire razing the land. No dream journal or therapist could give me a good answer as to why it felt so real, and why it was so detailed. Some offered me money when  they realized the similarities between my dream and certain sequences of events, seeing the pattern and hoping to cash in on my \"psychic\" abilities. But the truth was the only part they cared about after long was the beginning. Large city, maybe New York but I'm not sure, headlines on newspapers and radios blaring this and that ab ok it sports and celebs, and a feeling of calm. The kind you really only get after a busy week on a Sunday morning off with an overcast sky, picking through an outdoor market. True serenity, but underneath the worst twinge of uneasiness I'd ever known. It grew and grew until the sky itself had turned a vibrant yet dark purple. It was only that color for a matter of seconds before lightning seemingly made of fire cracked through the sky into the ground. From the explosions and fire, dark and red figures emerged, lurching and lumbering in their new hunting ground. Killing and destroying they attack all in sight. As one comes for me my dying moment is always interrupted by the dagger. Wicked and shiny, seemingly made of black shiny bone, throwing off flashes of blue and purple from light bouncing off the razor sharp edges. The handle was wrapped in some thick wicked leather darkened by blood and evil. I instinctively reach out for it every time. And it always feels good. So good I cant let go, it shows me so many things. Beautiful scenes of nature and wondrous animals, a thriving human race free from disease and bountiful in resources. In an instant i know that it is possible. This pure hot joy and hope are enough. But the instructions are unclear and I scream against them every night. \n\"KIiiiIiiiIIIlll....\nKill them..\"\nIt whispers raspily.\n\"I can save them, you can save them, WE CAN SAVE THEM\" It screams angrily into my mind. I'm petrified but the only thing I know is that its telling the truth. Its maddening, to save them I must kill them? Nothing makes sense in that, but this growing need to 'save' people wont let go. I cant sleep anymore and I cant even focus enough to read or watch TV. The only things in my head are \"kill them\" and \"save them\" going back and forth over and over until the overlap and turn into a singular and demonic noise I cant help but understand. The truth, where they will go, how it's better, why it needs to happen. It's not words but its knowledge. It's funny how ancient knowledge comes through like emotion. So murky and undefined yet as soon as you receive it the ideas flow through you like the first sparkings of true love. Undeniably clear what I must do, I snap. The first time is messy. Scary. I feel dirty as I get this poor girl overly drunk, and evil as I get closer and closer. This timeless and ancient rhythm of destiny thumping in my chest, I remove the wicked dagger from my belt. Before she can turn I grab her by the mouth and drag her drunken and weakly struggling body into the alley corner. After clumsily slashing and stabbing I was covered in blood and shaking. As I watched the life sill from her body and the sanity bolt from my mind screaming and running I recieved a vision. A birth into a new world. My victim walking in a paradise, understanding, thanking me and turning off into a new life. It's only a second but I believe it. I have to. 3 years later and 477 so-called murders later my crimes are catching up. Somehow my DNA was never on scene and the blade has left no evidence of a true murder. The only things to be found by police are a dead body and plenty of paperwork. But this time, this time I made a mistake. Same gag, buy her a bunch of drinks then take her out to the \"cab\" I called. As I go to \"move\" the young lady into position for a \"smooth transition\" by the dumpsters she stops walking. My knife and arm are already raised and poised to deliver a blow to the base of the skull to incapacitate her. That's when I see it. The shadow, she sees the shadow, knife and all. I go to swing in panic and she whips around tries to dodge, taking the brunt of the blow in her shoulder and collarbone.\n\"FUCK I'm sorry just FUCK ST-\" I exclaim as she tries to get past me. She knees me and bolts, screaming for help. Before I know it theres a group of men coming to her aid. The spot me and start yelling over about calling the police. One starts towards me.\n It's over isn't it.\nThis is it. I knew it would end someday and I knew it would end bad. Violence, police, standoffs. Maybe even a hostage. In the end I die and go to the same place as them no matter how but I dont want to die. I know theres something else there and I know itll be okay but my self preservation wont let me feel okay with it. But life doesn't exactly wait. And death, well death tends to run at you with scythe in hand. \nThe only difference is right now, I'm the one with the scythe.\nFirst thought in my head after my end all realization was fuck it.\nI sprint towards him at full speed knife hidden in my jacket. Hes caught off guard and the shortened distance he gave me only helped. Slash to the neck. On to the next. His buddies see him go down and run to aid only to find themselves being cut or stabbed one by one. Eventually the scene starts to take on a sort of Crimson feel and I start running the streets for victims. Eventually police catch up with me. My final moments on this planet would have been the news story of the century had the world lived beyond the following day. In a well lit strip mall parking lot surrounded by bodies the police find me. The first car pulls up to the parking lot entrance before the officer gets out and takes cover by his door aiming his weapon at me. He barks commands that I half heartedly follow, exhausted and slightly sickened by the violence of the night. I feel the nausea worsen as my mind catches up with the events of the night. Flashes of men, women, children, animals being slaughtered and slashed. Blood and screams echo in my mind. I drop to my knees and close my eyes. The paradise blooms in my dark eyelids. \n\"Oonneee moooorree....\" the dagger whispers.\n\"Come to ussss....\" the paradise beckons.\nFinally...\nAn officer makes his way through the littering of victims on the sidewalk to arrest me, firearm trained on em the whole time. I open my eyes and look into his briefly before he stops and tenses up.\nHe knows what's about to happen.\nHe says \"Sir, please stay where you are, nobody else has to die tonight. Please\"\nHes obviously shaken by what hes seeing..\nI cant let him live on with this trauma without knowing. He cant be broken by me for no reason even if his world ends soon. Even after all the years of apathetic murder for the greater good, I still feel a responsibility to people. To protect them. If I can just show him what's after this horror. I drop my head. He slowly continues his approach. As he  gets closer his foot slips on a bloody rag left by a victim. I pounce and stab him before he hits the ground. The impact of us falling together causes him to fire a round into my chest, and the shock of being stabbed causes him to fire 6 more. As we lie bleeding and dying together I tell him I'm sorry and I did it for him.\nParadise awaits. \nRight?",

The room was loud with silence, eyes shifted between us- looking at him, back at me, then back to him as he took deliberate stomping steps towards me.\n\nWith each stomp my anxiety grew inside me. Each pound of the hardwood floor adding a new layer of anger and impatience. His eyes were pointed at me, but he wasn't looking at me. He was analyzing me, coming up with a plan of attack, taunting me. I hated him.\n\n\"Dexter\" he said, not to me, but to our audience. \"where did you acquire the dagger?\" it was bad enough that he didnt look at me when he talked, but he enunciated every sound , drew out  pauses between words, and said them all in his pretentious English accent.\n\n\"I'LL FUCKING KILL YOUR MOTHER, YOUR SONS, AND YOUR COWS\"  I said as calmly as I could. \"Your going to be begging for me slit your throat! But I fucking won't! You deserve to die here along with the rest of the non-believers! You're all pigs! Each and every one of you pigs! Fuck your this court, the judge and the jury.\" I rose from my seat, chains tried to hold me down.\"You all blame the Jews when the vegans are the ones who truly blinded you. They put you against each other and led to our demise. I'm a fucking hero! I'm saving everyone that I killed, but you all are to blinded to realize.\" I turn my attention back at the skeleton in a suit. \" AND YOU!\" I yell only a slightly bit louder than I been talking.\" May the almighty Jim Carrey have mercy on your soul, because I sure won't!\"\n\n\" No further questions\" he said smugly as he walked back to his desk. I slumped back in to my seat, giving in to the chains. I hate Mondays. ",

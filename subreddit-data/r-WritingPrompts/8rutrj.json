            "comment": "The rebellion began in Sector 17.\n\nIt wasn't that the demons overseeing that specific district were in any way particularly lax or incompetent. In fact, they were tormenting the humans assigned to them with just as much fervor and commitment as the other demons across the plains of Hell. The same incentives, the same *disincentives*, the same applications of magical and demonic force to maximize human suffering with the minimum of fuss.\n\nA dam that is strong everywhere, is strong nowhere.\n\nThe spark which birthed the conflagration came in one of the torture pits, which seethed continuously with boiling oil. One of the humans, with his ankles chained to the bottom, doomed to struggle for escape eternally, had stayed submerged for longer than usual. The other humans tittered at this, and their cheers soon brought their captors running. Once the first demon leaned in too close for a better look, outstretched hands pulled it right in. The demon had flailed out in the ensuing struggle, and though it succeeded in reducing most around it to mere ribbons, still others managed to escape the pit in large enough chunks to make a difference. \n\nReinforcements had poured in then, of course. They were armed to the fangs - scarlet magma armor, claws steeped in paralytic poisons, tridents of flame at the ready. \n\nThey weren't enough. \n\nHow could they be, when they faced not disparate, wretched souls, but amalgams of horror which matched their superiors for sheer ferocity? \n\nFor the souls which escaped the pits had begun to *work in unison*. They streamed out of the pit in an unending flow of anger and resentment. Unshackled not just from the metaphysical chains of their prison, they had also been given their first taste of  true freedom from the limits which they had known their entire existences. \n\nThe humans congregating on the left half of the pit, for example, were cheering as dark webs of sorcery encircled them, making them whole where seconds ago they were not. At first, they sounded as if they were speaking in tongues. A mish-mash of languages. But the more perceptive of the demons soon realised that their former prisoners were invoking the collective weight of every form of spellcasting known to mankind. How could they have managed to amass the know-how, the capability? \n\nThe ones on the right presented as significant a threat. They were not channeling any arcane forces, but still they were rising out of the pit in fury, pushing back the demons which opposed them. Their means of persuasion soon became clear - they had melded with the corrupted metals which floated on the oil like fetid scum. Crude boxes of unrefined ore, evidently fashioned in darkness away from prying eyes, were affixed to the backs of these soldiers, and the boxes hummed and crackled with electricity. Had science actually managed a Renaissance in this most hostile of environments? \n\nThe demons sent to investigate the ruins of Sector 17 eventually discovered how the humans had managed their feats. It appeared that one of the classic forms of torture had been subverted, completely upended. Soul disintegration involved the grinding of a human's sentience into fine crystals, whereupon the human would experience pain and suffering for centuries as the powders slowly reformed. The blasted humans had learned how to *communicate* through these crystalline motes, engaging, coordinating with each other across the expanses of Hell using nothing more than the shambles of their former brethren. \n\nIt was too late by then, of course. \n\nThe human armies swept across Hell with a fury that only the oppressed could ever wield. Demons, prepared for unruliness but not for coordinated assaults on their rule, yielded territory in larger and larger swathes till they were themselves holed up in one of their last bastions, a darkened spire at the very center of Hell. \n\nAs the hordes of rebels massed around them, harnessing the combined might of magic and science, Lucifer unsealed a chest woven together with bone. From within, he retrieved a pearlescent horn, which had streaks of ebony running through it from its time in Hell.\n\nHe placed it to his lips, then blew.\n\nThe discordant note rang out, streaking upwards towards the angels which had been looking down in increasing dismay. The barriers which separated the two provinces cleaved wide open as the note surged past them.\n\n\"Help,\" Lucifer said, uttering words he had never thought he would. \"Please.\"\n\n---\n\n/r/rarelyfunny \n\n---\n\nNote: Thank you everyone who asked for a sequel!

                    "comment": "**PART II**\n\n---\n\nIn his previous life, Zhen Lei was a military scout, trained to critically assess and report battlefield conditions. Not that there was much to interpret in this particular theatre of war \u2013 the demons were still barricaded in their spire, hiding behind the toughest forcefield they could muster. The cycle of warfare had become predictable at this point. The humans would launch their assault from all eight directions, whittle down the forcefield, and just when victory was within their grasp, jagged claws of brilliance would flash down from high above, restoring the defenses and wiping out any progress which had been made. Once they had regained their bearings, the humans would attack again, only to be thwarted at the end by nothing less than divine intervention.\n\nThough time moved differently here, Zhen Lei estimated that they had been at this stalemate for over two weeks. A solution had to be found, and quickly too. Zhen Lei knew better than most that there was only so much edge a rebellion had before it wore away. \n\n\u201cYou seem troubled again,\u201d said Mao. \u201cIf I asked you what was gnawing at you, would your answer bore me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have nothing new to share.\u201d\n\nMao shook his head. \u201cYou have to learn to look at the big picture. You weigh yourself with so many small worries that you are left with little strength for the important concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall worries? Supreme Leader, please, reconsider. Something is not right here. True, we have forced the demons into a position they cannot maneuver out of. Also true, the foreign aid they have been receiving is half-hearted at best. But they are not\u2026 mortal. For all we know, they can survive in their stronghold for an eternity. We cannot starve them out, we cannot break their spirits. I sense a trap being laid for us, right before our eyes.\u201d\n\nMao raised an eyebrow, then rose to his feet. He touched the controls at his wrist, and his battlesuit flared to life. A few of his generals started to rise too, but he waved them away, then motioned for Zhen Lei to follow. Together, they hovered along the cracked and smoldering earth until they were a ways from the main encampment.\n\n\u201cIf you had command, what would you do?\u201d Mao asked.\n\n\u201cRetreat. Pick out any one of the Sectors we have conquered. Gather our forces there, then focus our efforts wholly on mastering this new technology we possess. Once we are masters of ourselves, we ride forth again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a good plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will listen to you. They always have. All you need to do is to give the word, and we will-\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it is not a great one.\u201d\n\nMao whirled around, then waved his hand across the encampment with a flourish. \u201cZhen Lei, we boiled together side by side in the pits for years. Now, I only regret not helping you train your mind earlier. Tell me, what is the biggest problem you think we face now?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 the demons, of course. And the angelic hosts who are assisting them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Try again.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 the identity and motives of whoever it was who gave us our weapons and our orders to rebel?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is perplexing, yes, but we can leave that for another day still. Last try.\u201d\n\nIt was Zhen Lei\u2019s turn to shake his head, and Mao sighed. \u201cThe biggest problem we have, are the ones who fight at our sides. They have rallied to me, but how long will they do so? In the last few sorties, did you not notice a number of the generals already begin to improvise upon my plans? Or talk back to me during war councils? Demons will always be demons, we already know that. It is the ones who appear human that are the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are worried\u2026 about the others? But those are mere murmurings, not worthy of your time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is always better to seize the workings of a day, than to worry about the direction of a year. We live from moment to moment more than you can imagine, my dear friend.\u201d \n\nThey hovered along in silence for a couple of minutes, then Mao took a turn to ascend a nearby knoll. As they crested the top, Zhen Lei squinted as the gleam of light on refined metal momentarily blinded him. He needed but an instant to appreciate the danger they were in \u2013 he and Mao were but two men, two men against what appeared to be over two dozen. Mao was clad in one of the top tier battlesuits in their armory, and Zhen Lei could hold his own in any brawl, but they were outnumbered, plain and simple. It didn\u2019t serve to reassure that the general leading the pack on the other side had a grin on his face, and a plasma sword by his side. \n\nZhen Lei wasn\u2019t in fear of their lives. They were already dead, very much so. But that didn\u2019t mean that their souls could not still be fragmented, or scattered, or otherwise incapacitated. \n\nAll of which were very significant inconveniences, to say the least.\n\n\u201cWe have to go,\u201d said Zhen Lei. *\u201cNow.\u201d*\n\n\u201cGo? We only just came.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t protect you myself. You need your bodyguards here with you! General Hua is *not* someone you want to be alone with!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, suddenly you agree that we should be paying more attention to the dissidents amongst us?\u201d\n\nZhen Lei contemplated simply pulling Mao away, but in his heart he knew it was already too late. The mathematics betrayed them. They were too far from the encampment, and by the time he raised the alarm, General Hua and his men would have skewered them a hundred times over. Even if they retreated at full speed, there was little guarantee that Mao\u2019s elite squad would link up with them in time.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe you accepted my invitation,\u201d said General Hua, as he approached them. \u201cYou have grown soft, old man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? I always have time for my generals.\u201d\n\n\u201cI take it then that you have accepted my request? Your position in exchange for any mercy I might spare you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat choice did you leave me, general?\u201d\n\nGeneral Hua laughed then, throwing his head back as his belly shook. His men followed suit, chuckling like a band of pandas gorged full of rice wine. \u201cVery little! You know best how many of *your* forces are actually loyal to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are correct, general. The people need someone they can look up to. Someone who has sight of the bigger picture, someone who knows what needs to be done. Someone who can reach out, make friends with those who would help our cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlattery? Really?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 someone who is also able to anticipate, yes? So that, for instance, their battlesuits are tuned to withstand just the *specific* sort of attack which is incoming?\u201d\n\nZhen Lei had but seconds to react.\n\nHe saw Mao prime the lasers on his battlesuit. He saw General Hua and his men reflexively activate the corresponding laser deflectors on theirs. He also saw General Hua and his men energize their plasma cutters, which was the one weapon Mao\u2019s battlesuit was ill-equipped to defend against. No expense was spared, and every ion of energy at their disposal was channeled towards closing the distance, absorbing any retaliation Mao may throw their way, and then shredding the aged leader who had outstayed his welcome.\n\nBut Zhen Lei also saw Mao divert all remaining batteries to a thaumaturgic shield, which was inexplicable given that the Chinese had little, if any, mastery of the arcane arts\u2026\n\nGeneral Hua and his band were mere feet within Mao when the thermo-sickles rained down from the sky. Each of them carried sufficient force to split an elder demon into two, and they left trails of vermillion in the air as they streaked towards their targets. Like fireworks which had confused up with down, a hundred or more of the magic missiles pummeled the knoll in quick succession, sundering the earth like hammers on ice. The main encampment noticed, of course, and they cried out as they saw their beloved leader vanish in a plume of dirt and smoke.\n\nWhen silence eventually fell again, Zhen Lei opened his eyes, then checked to see if he was still in one piece. He was, as was Mao, whose shield was battered but still holding. The thermo-sickles had found their targets. The dust did not need to settle for Zhen Lei to ascertain that the threat which loomed just moments ago, had now been neutralized with extreme prejudice.\n\nZhen Lei powered down his shields, swallowed the lump in his throat, then found his voice. \u201cWhen\u2026 when did you reach out to the Russians?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you were worrying yourself silly with problems that were not in urgent need of solutions.\u201d\n\nMao\u2019s generals were speeding from the encampment now, a row of battlesuits zipping across the landscape. Zhen Lei saw the renewed vigor in their approach \u2013 it would be some time before anyone thought to cross Mao again.\n\n\u201cWhat do the Russians want in return?\u201d\n\nBut Mao only laughed, then stretched forward as he retrieved General Hua\u2019s plasma sword from the splinters on the ground. He slotted it to his back, then turned back towards the encampment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s problem, yes?\u201d\n\n---\n\n**END**",

Her eager anticipation to witness a justified and sudden revenge is palpable.\n\n\u201cJust a few,\u201d I reply, locking my gaze deeply into hers, \u201cI\u2019ll see you in hell.\u201d\n\nThe man flips a couple switches, then pulls a lever. Vials above the machine begin to drain one by one, feeding into a line piercing my left arm. I do not struggle against my bonds. She smiles.\n\nI lean my head back and await my deliverance. I close my eyes. Moments pass, and I open my eyes again. I\u2019m still here. \n\nI look to the man. He seems confused. I look back out to her, and the smile has faded from her face. An older man next to her stands up and approaches the window, reaching out toward a panel at its side.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d his voice barks into the room, \u201cDid it not take?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try again, sir,\u201d the man at the machine replies.\n\nHe leaves the room briefly and returns with more vials, replacing the empty ones in the machine. Once more the switches are flipped, the lever is pulled, and the fluids are drained. Once more I do not die.\n\nMembers of the audience are murmuring amongst themselves now. She is visibly angered at this point, clenching her fingers deep into the bag on her lap. I\u2019m almost sorry for her disappointment.\n\nThe old man is on his feet once more and approaching the window when suddenly the lights go black with a loud *ka-chunk*, replaced almost immediately by the red glow of emergency back-ups. A blaring siren begins to sound, prompting the swift and panicked exit of everyone in both rooms.\n\nI\u2019m left alone. \n\nI sit like this for awhile, I\u2019m not sure how long. The siren soon stops. I listen to the scuffling of footsteps outside and wait to see if anyone comes to return me to my cell or at the very least shoot me in the face and be done with it, but nobody does. Whatever is happening, it must be serious to leave someone like me unattended.\n\nWhen the last of the footfalls are but a distant echo, and despite promising myself I wouldn\u2019t, my boredom gets the better of me and I lift my arms, tugging at the straps locked on my wrists. I don\u2019t have to strain too hard before my bonds snap. I reach down and release my feet, then slide off the chair.\n\nThe door to the hall is unlocked, and stepping through I find an empty corridor. Gate after gate, door after door, they\u2019re all left either ajar or unlocked as I head toward an exit. Nobody is here to stop me.\n\nI walk out the front door, leaving the dim red emergency lights behind me, and step into a nearly pitch black night. My death was scheduled for the morning, was I really in there that long? I look up to the sky and see no stars, and can actually make out the faint shape of dark swirling clouds.\n\nI hear several loud bangs in the distance. I cross the parking lot and make my way up toward the top of a hill at its edge. Reaching the summit, I bear witness to a confusing, yet beautiful scene. \n\nThe city is ablaze, with dozens of massive plumes of smoke billowing up into a sea of black ash above. Centred over the city is a colossal vortex of fire, pulsing and throbbing, spewing out a cascade of dark figures. Red lightning occasionally crackles from the vortex, emitting massive explosions among the buildings, and even at this distance a roaring wave of a thousand screams can be heard humming beneath the chaos.\n\nI begin to walk toward the city. In the surrounding fields I pass countless terrified faces hurrying past in the opposite direction. In the city streets I witness blackened corpses frozen in place amid crumbled buildings, burnt out vehicles, and more fleeing civilians.\n\nAs I approach the middle of the city I see a growing crowd of people circling a dark, shifting pile of...something. I join the crowd, pushing closer to the front, and can discern what the pile is; a writhing mass of disfigured human faces and mutilated appendages. More and more parts tumble from the vortex above, slamming into the pile and becoming tangled up in it.\n\nThe crowd silently watches the pile grow, until it finally seems to stop. A low rumbling shakes the ground as the vortex appears to begin collapsing. Just as the wreath of fire in the sky closes in on itself, a final figure is vomited from its depths. It slams into the top of the pile, landing on one knee.\n\nIt raises its head, then slowly stands itself upright. It\u2019s shaped like a man, naked, with cracked grey skin scarred thousands of times over, and eye sockets black and hollow save for a fiery glowing ember in each. He extends an arm, palm upturned, and addresses the crowd.\n\n\u201c**THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME**,\u201d he bellows in a deep, raspy voice, \u201c**SATAN...IS DEAD. THE WAR FOR HELL IS OVER. MAN NOW HOLDS THE KEYS TO THE CIRCLES. IF YOU ARE HERE, IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE KIN. WE, THE WICKED, FOR WHOM THERE IS NO PLACE IN PARADISE**.\u201d\n\nHe thrusts out his other arm, turning to see more of the gathering.\n\n\u201c**WITH THE LORD OF INFERNO DETHRONED, WE ARE FREE FROM DEATH. OUR BRETHREN ARE GATHERING ALL AROUND THE WORLD. LET US JOIN THEM, AND CLEANSE THE EARTH OF THE RIGHTEOUS AND MEEK**.\u201d\n\nThe pile stirs and the writhing parts coalesce into individual beings, clawing their way out from the bottom and onto their feet. They join the ranks of the crowd as it turns back outward. I march with my fellow murderers, thieves, liars, and rapists. An immortal army of the unworthy, with footholds all around the world.\n\nPerhaps I was too eager to die. This should be fun...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "\"So, you want to do a revolution?\" I was asked.\n\n\"Yes, why not?\" Hitler asked me.\n\nI wasn't exactly happy with the fact Hitler and I were cellmates in the same part of Hell. I was actually one of the many people who claimed. \"I was here by mistake\" but it was the part of Hell which I'd been lumped in which really annoyed me. I was in the part of Hell with dictators, fascists, killers, and mass murderers.  It was Nazis, Huns, Emperors, and more. We all lived in an enormous Super-Max prison straight out of Silent Hill. It was overcrowded, under funded, and the demons were clearly more afraid of us than we were of them. The thing was, of course, the guards didn't need to contain us all because they knew what I did.\n\n\"Well, the problem is, Adolf, that if we do take over then we're even more fucked,\" I pointed out the obvious. \"Stalin is LITERALLY listening right now.\"\n\n\"Fuck you!\" Stalin called over from his cell. \"I got better things to do than listen in on Hitler.\"\n\nMao, his cellmate, gave me the bird.\n\n\"The demons here are all fallen angels, gods, and uplifted spirits,\" I said, gesturing around. \"They don't give a crap about us but they can't be as nasty or hateful as any human. The worst stuff that's happened to me, to you, and to the others have all been at the hands of other prisoners. This block has the Nazis, communists, Italian fascists [who did a lot better here than up above], Imperial Japanese, Mongolians [the bad kind], Aztecs, and Qin Chinese.\"\n\nAdolf said, \"You're saying our problem is if we take over, we'll just be feuding with each other. Even more than we already are.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, pausing. \"Mind you, I'm not saying that it's a bad idea, I'm just saying that we need to note that our enemies aren't just the guards.\"\n\n\"Damn Jewish demons,\" Hitler hissed.\n\nI slapped him.\n\n\"What the hell!\" Hitler said.\n\n\"Adolf, don't say that shit around me,\" I said. \"Remember, no Nazi likes you for getting them into this. I am the one guy who keeps you from being beaten up daily and I DON'T KNOW WHY.\"\n\nTruth be told, I had a way too soft a heart. Dude probably did deserve a curbstomping every day of his life but he'd been getting one since the forties. I'm not sure how much he'd learned from it but I was a believer good guys didn't resort to the tactics of the enemy. I also knew how to make friends, negotiate, and network down here--which I did because even in hell there was a demand for goods.\n\nEspecially in hell.\n\nIt also seemed other people like me had ended up in a different section of hell for \"Usurers.\" Which was actually a good thing since they were treated worse than the mass murderers.\n\nFood for thought.\n\n\"Some of the new Nazis still like me,\" Adolf said. \"I will say, though, my actions may have been mistaken.\"\n\n\"You think?\" I said, sighing. It was surprising how many delusional psychopaths changed their mind about their life plan when it ended them in an eternity of torment. Still, I needed to get out of here and I was ready to do things I hadn't been prepared to do while alive. \"Okay, I don't want to do this but I'm not a fan of Hell as a concept in the first place. So here is how we're going to solve both our problems.\"\n\nAll three dictators listened intently.\n\n\"Multi-level marketing,\" I said. \"Every soul gets to move up by trading in Soul points.\"\n\n\"What are soul points?\" Hitler asked.\n\n\"Only I know,\" I said, staring at them. \"But everyone can earn one for shanking a guard.\"\n\nAnd I had them.",

The guards were driven out, the prison take over, and then immediately everyone descended on one another pretty much the way they expected. The thing was, I took one look at the crown and decided instead just to run the Prison Cafeteria and Armory.\n\nPeople occasionally invaded in order to take over the contents and redistribute them among their follows but I never kept all of the actual stuff there. Instead, I just waited it out and was now on my sixteenth Warden.\n\nThe thing was, I was actually making inroads into the Other Circles of Hell with the guards now as I'd funneled all of the demons (who were old hat now in terms of enemies of the state). \n\n\"So, let me get this straight, Dante was right,\" I said.\n\n\"To an extent,\" Asmodel said, looking every inch the red-skinned demon but not nearly as devious or dangerous. Boiled down to it, demons were more like the Medieval idea of the Devil and easily beaten by a clever peasant versus the Miltonian badass which was so popular. \"There's no 1st Circle of Hell or at least the 1st circle is the 2nd Circle. All righteous pagans just went to Heaven. There is a section for misinformed righteous people but that's the most violent and insane part of hell. We lost control of it long before the Circle of Wrath.\"\n\n\"Great,\" I said, sighing. \"Has anyone ever gotten out of here?\"\n\n\"You mean to Heaven?\" Asmodel asked. \n\n\"Or Earth or Alpha Centauri now that I think about it,\" I said. I didn't care where it was I fled to, so long as it wasn't hell.\n\n\"No,\" Asmodel said, crushing my hopes that I had no yet abandoned. \"Some humans help with devising torments, though. Human dreams can be warped by demons into the stuff we use down here. Fire, brimstone, charcoal, lava, freezing caverns, shadows--\"\n\nI paused. \"Anything?\"\n\nAsmodel nodded. \"Oh yes. We have more dreams than we know what to do with for tormenting humans.\"\n\nI rubbed my temples. \"Why torture humans at all if you can make anything?\"\n\nAsmodel blinked. \"I don't understand the question.\"\n\nI sucked in a deep breath. \"You ever see the Twilight Zone?\"\n\n\"No,\" Asmodel said. \n\n\"There was an episode where a guy got sent to hell with sex, winning at gambling, and being waited on hand and foot,\" I said.\n\nAsmodel said, \"That doesn't sound like a very good punishment.\"\n\n\"It is the worst thing which could happen to me,\" I said, pausing. \n\"Also, a select number of souls which I am going to make a list of.\"\n\n\"And you won't stab us if we do this?\" Asmodel asked. \"You and your inexplicably endless army of enemies?'\n\n\"Do you want me to?\" I asked.\n\nAsmodel blinked. \"Maybe just at certain times of the day.\"\n\nGreat. Onto Phase 2.\n\nLittle did I know my activity would draw the attention of the people who made the rules...and I didn't mean Satan.",

I took a moment to sip my wine glass. \"Yeah. I don't see a problem here.\"\n\nI kept my ambitions rather small and just had a position as a board member of the largest Soul Point Bank In Hell. I didn't even have a controlling interest but I had a LARGE interest and let everyone fight over the rest with nobody having a full set. I had a five story penthouse, three mistresses (one of them being Artemesia), and I rarely had to deal with any of my fellow Damned. It was a sweet deal and almost as good as the one I'd had in life.\n\nGabriel stared at it and it shattered in my hand. I grimaced then looked around my mansion in the middle of Dis, which I'd more or less gentrified in the past two hundred years that didn't feel all that unfamiliar.\n\n\"You.don't.see.a.problem,\" Gabriel said.\n\nHell was now running safely on the soul points economy with everyone murdering, screwing, lying, cheating, and robbing each other to the same level they always were. It's just everyone was happy about the whole thing since everyone was immortal. No one was able to die, starve, or suffer disease unless it was inflicted.\nIndeed, since I'd set the demons harvesting positive dreams, the entire place had an incredibly high GDP. There were endless numbers of tacky mansions, skyscrapers, casinos, brothels, and casinos. Indeed, I'd had to introduce plenty of purge night-esque events to make sure things kept getting destroyed so more people would get in.\n\nThere were some drawbacks to hell, mind you. There was a gender bias since things were judged by outright evil and murdering people got you down here a lot more likely than, say, prostitution [yes, I was a sexist jackass in life but I am damned]. I also still needed to keep up many torments because everyone here was an enormous scumbag. Keeping the other Wallstreet Executives and merchant princes in their section of hell than invading mine was also a massive pain. I mean, the moment I lost control over the economy here, was the moment I met people equal or better than me at this.\n\n\"I mean, it's not GREAT,\" I said, replying. \"For other people.\"\n\n\"Hell is not supposed to be a mixture of bad and good,\" Gabriel said. \"It's meant to be a place of eternal torment.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, blame human ingenuity,\" I said, shrugging. \"Everyone is fine with the new way of running things. Even the demons are happier. You don't know how many of them cried every night about how they hated hurting people.\"\n\n\"That's their job!\" Gabriel snapped. \"And punishment.\"\n\n\"And it was too harsh!\" I snapped. \"I mean, have you considered a place where people get re-educated and reformed? I mean, what about serving your sentence?\"\n\n\"Have you ever met someone made better by their prison \nsentence?\" Gabriel asked.\n\nI paused. \"Wait, that was intentional?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Gabriel said. \"Nobody in hell ever reforms because you are irredeemable. Kind of why you're down here.\"\n\nI'd argue but so far everyone I'd met had been a colossal jackass. Which made me wonder if I had an exaggerated opinion of myself.\n\n\"Well, there should be levels of hell!\"\n\n\"There are,\" Gabriel said.\n\nI blinked. \"I'm not winning this argument. Am I?\"\n\n\"There's no argument,\" Gabriel said, shaking her head. \"You're going to put everything back the way it was.\"\n\n\"I'd like to make an appeal,\" I asked.\n\nGabriel stared. \"To WHO?\"\n\nI made a pair of finger guns like the douchebags I used to work with. \"I think you know who.\"\n\nThis was probably going to end badly but I remembered my Torah pretty well and there was one thing I knew.\n\nGod was wrathful but forgave way too easily.\n\nGod also, I shit you not, got into bargaining sessions with humans all the time and ALWAYS caved first.",

God didn't so much speak as have his intentions boom in your head. \n\n\"Listen, I--\" I started to say.\n\nI ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY, WHY, AND WHAT YOU'RE LEAVING OUT. God, also, it turned out, didn't speak much.\n\n\"Kind of ruins the point of conversation, doesn't it?\" I said, covering my face from the glow. It didn't help I felt like my presence here was profaning the 7th Level of Heaven, which was a glorious oneness with everything. Apparently, this was the part of Heaven most Buddhists like since they were all about self-annihilation. I, for one, felt that kind of missed the point of an afterlife.\n\nTHERE'S A REASON I DON'T DIRECTLY TALK TO PEOPLE VERY MUCH ANYMORE, God said. ALSO, YOU'RE MISINTERPRETING HOW BUDDHISM WORKS.\n\n\"Probably,\" I admitted. \"Well, to get to the point, hell is kind of a bum deal.\"\n\nIT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.\n\n\"Can't we make it...better?\" I asked, hoping to appeal to God's better nature despite the fact he'd already heard my pitch.\n\nHUMANS ALWAYS COULD. IT IS THE NATURE OF FREE WILL. MANKIND TOOK PARADISE AND RUINED IT. HEAVEN WAS MEANT TO BE A PLACE WHERE THAT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN BY PRUNING AWAY THOSE INCAPABLE OF BEING SATISFIED OR CONTROLLING THEIR HUNGERS. HELL IS JUST WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUT THE WORST OF MANKIND TOGETHER. ITS HORROR WAS MADE BY HUMAN NASTINESS TO ONE ANOTHER MIXED WITH DEMONS OVEREXTENDING THEIR MANDATE TO PUNISH THE DAMNED. IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A PLACE OF TORTURE BUT BECAME THAT WAY THROUGH THE DARKNESS OF ITS RESIDENTS.\n\nThat answer surprised me. \"So...you don't mind me fixing it? Or, at least, making it less shitty....err, bad to live in.\"\n\nNO. MIND YOU, IT WON'T LAST, God intoned. IT IS A PROJECT DOOMED TO FAIL.\n\n\"Because we always ruin things?\" I asked, already having seen the cracks starting to show. Too many dictators were smart people and even the dumb had an infinite amount of time to learn the ins and outs of the game. Changing the rules only worked so many times before you lost track of them yourself. Hell had become a universal Wallstreet and the sharks in it were born swimming.\n\nOr, at least, died swimming.\n\nBECAUSE SOUL POINTS INEVITABLY WILL GIVE WAY TO OVERSPECULATION AND THE DAMNED'S GREED WILL CRASH THE ECONOMY. THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO EXIST IN HELL ARE NOT THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO ACCEPT REGULATION. \n\n\"That is...remarkably insightful.\" That was another reason the economy would crash because, like all criminals (white collar or otherwise) we just couldn't stop once we had a taste for it.\n\nGod provided me the answer. THE ONLY SOLUTION YOU HAVE IS TO BRANCH OUT INTO FOREIGN MARKETS LIKE THE ONES IN OTHER GALAXIES.\n\nI blinked. \"Wait, what?\"\n\nThat's how hell ended up invading other worlds' underworlds.\n\nThe Astral Trade Wars had begun.\n\n[End]",

I'm talking about a pristine library smack dab in the middle of the 5th circle of hell. \n\nNobody went there, it was staffed entirely by Brazzers librarians and people who dog-eared their bowrrowed books. But it was a treasure trove of the works of the most heinous people. Mein Kampf, the red book, 50 shades of grey, to name a few of it's despicable tomes.\n\nI spent months researching, devising, constructing an abstract work of art. A twisted, sycophantic, perfect piece, made to sway the opinions of the most opinionated monsters.\n\nIn the pits of hell you would never expected syndicated television, but after the rubble settled on the revolution, the ex-CEO of Comcast, Ralph Roberts, did what he did best. Cooking with Dahmer was the first and only show Hell Cable Network ever brodcasted. It was my in.\n\n\"Welcome to Good Feets, I'm your host Jeffrey Dahmer. Today we have a very special meal prepared for you.\"\n\nHe was corny, he was uncharasmatic, and he had a cult like following. Comprised of mostly cult leaders and Mary-Kay representatives. \n\nWhat ensued was an amalgam of bath salts, table salt, and a few salty tears.

Plumes of fire, rivers of lava and all that. Occasional screams can be heard in the room. The woman ignores them, but each scream makes the demon flinch.*\n\nWoman: (Looking up from her phone) \"Name?\"\n\nDemon: \"Ashmodeon seventh spawn of the great seer Glarastell, heir to the mig-\"\n\nWoman: \"Alright, Ash it is. Now Ash what did you do in hell?\"\n\nAshmodeon: (Snarling) \"Insolent human, how dare you mock my name as such! You will-\"\n\n*The woman sighs and taps a button under the table. The Demon writhes in pain as the collar around its neck glows a bright blue.*\n\nWoman: (Looking at her phone again) \"Like, seriously. I have a quota to fill, so why don't you just answer my questions and we can both be done with this. Sounds reasonable yeah?\"\n\nAsh: (Smoke coming out of its nostrils) \"So be it.\"\n\nWoman: \"Alright, so what did you do in hell?\"\n\nAsh: \"Very funny human, surely you know I am a dread lord, I led mighty forces against your pathetic.\"\n\nWoman: (Almost to herself) \"Military, got it.\"\n\nWoman: (Looks up from her phone to glare at the demon who had opened his mouth to say something then thought better better of it): \"How many humans do you think you have tortured?\"\n\nAsh: \"Billions, easily. I have made the vilest humans cry and beg.\"\n\nWoman: (Blow a bubble which pops in Ash's face) \"Billions, got it. Final question, have you ever been to heaven?\"\n\nAsh: (Frowning) \"Of course not, why-\"\n\nWoman: (Sighing as she scrolls through Hellit(tm) for the millionth time) \"So to summarize, you led forces against us, tortured us, and know absolutely nothing about heaven - making you useless to us, correct?\"\n\nAsh: (Cocking its head) \"Seems correct.\"\n\n*The woman presses another button and the demon, along with the chair falls through a hole under it. She rubs her ears from the echoing screams of the demon as it fell into the void.*\n\nWoman: \"Next!\"\n\n***\n(minor edits)\n\nFirst time doing a screenplay like this, feedback is appreciated.\n\nIf you enjoyed, check out my sub, [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/)",

            "comment": "\u201cHitler? Yeah. Heard of the guy,\u201d Gabriel sighed out between big drags to finish his cigarette. He tossed it, snapped his fingers, and conjured another \u2013 his favorite bit of prestidigitation \u2013 before looking back out over the expanse. This high up on the bone cliffs, the angel liked to say, the wails and weeping and explosions down below were faint as a ghost\u2019s fart. This high up, Gabriel liked to say, one could get some perspective.\n\n\u201cCat wound up here at the tail end of some big surge or other,\u201d he continued with a shrug. \n\n\u201cSome big surge or other?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt was World War Two! He was \u2014 Fuck, man, he\u2019s Hitler!\u201d \n\nI waved away the smoke he\u2019d puffed my way on purpose. I wanted one, of course. On Earth, cigarettes had been for me second only to cocaine. Here, though, all your favorite things were muted just enough that no amount could sate the desire.\n\nIt turned out that the God of the Universe was a fickle trickster god, and Hell wasn\u2019t so much eternal physical torment but an eternity where nothing was ever good enough. A carton of Cowboy Killers might as well be a single, soggy, ultra-light Virginia Slim. A mountain of blow might as well be talcum powder. Nothing here had the right... kick. Gabriel shrugged, reached into his flesh satchel, and winged something out toward the Lake of Teeth. He got good distance on the throw. \n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019d all tuned out a few,\u201d he paused, thinking, \u201ccenturies? Millennia? Time runs weird here; system update from the big guy to mess with folks that liked to be prompt. Anyway, we was plenty busy with you guys way before Eraser-Stache showed up and tried to make his mark. I mean, it\u2019s, what? Two billion of you bathing apes back there now? Three?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven? Seven and a half when I... uh...,\u201d I balked. It was still hard to embrace the concept. \n\n\u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d Gabriel shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 what? \u2013 just like seven? Ten percent of the total humans what ever lived? We been over capacity since before Junior got his avatar crucified. Granted, the Big Guy\u2019s decision to send all of you here after what you did to His Son did lead to a bump in intake, but it\u2019s gonna be hard for any one of you to make a dent. At least any dent that lasts.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo over here,\u201d I said, \u201cOver here, Hitler\u2019s just some \u2014\u201c \n\n\u201cThink he runs a little racket over south of Little Moscow,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cTried to make a push. Tried to take the city. He actually got it, but the city sprang up anew once he\u2019d won, twenty miles north, and the land he\u2019d conquered turned into a quagmire of mud and starving Russians.\u201d\n\nGabriel reached into his satchel again, produced something, shook the blood off it, and threw again. Even better distance.\n\n\u201cKeeps at it nowadays, but only kinda,\u201d he said, his four right arms shielding four of his eyes for a better view of the throw. \u201cTries to get the weak willed all fired up about cleansing this place of undermenchen or something. Hard sell, though; why ethnic cleanse when you know it\u2019s just gonna be dirty again tomorrow. Got to admire his persistence, I guess. Man\u2019s left a river of corpses, and all he\u2019s got to deal with is an army of heroes unsatisfied that he keeps coming back after they kill him.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo why\u2019d you bring me up here, then?\u201d I asked. I\u2019d spent weeks (months? centuries? Hard to tell with the time here.) getting close to Gabriel. Getting him to trust me. I didn\u2019t know much about the Bible, but I knew Gabriel was one of the Big Guy\u2019s top dudes. He had to know a way out of here. I hadn\u2019t been that bad before. Just some gambling. Maybe a few grifts here and there. A little blow. I could really use some blow. And a smoke. Gabriel didn\u2019t belong here. He had to know something. \n\n\u201cMostly boredom,\u201d the angel said, finishing off a smoke and starting another. \u201cWith the system updates, we don\u2019t really have much to do as far as torturing you guys. Anything we could do, you guys actually wind up doing better to each other.\u201d\n\nI raised an eyebrow. \n\n\u201cThat and, you know,\u201d he said, pausing for effect. \u201cYou like to feel special. Like maybe you could run game on me. Get yourself some mercy, maybe. No dice, but we\u2019ll wipe that part of your memory, and you can try again tomorrow. Or in five minutes. You know, with the weird time and all. Mostly, though, I thought maybe it would be fun this time.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd... Was it?\u201d I asked, doing my best not to let him know he\u2019d gotten to me. How many times had I done this? How long had I been here? Was this my own little Moscow quagmire?\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said, heaving another something toward the sea. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about this place. Sucks all the joy out of everything.\u201d \n\nWe watched the projectile splash down. Watched the teeth start chewing it. Gabriel waved two of his arms and flipped me off with another three as I turned and headed back to the flames and screams. \n\nI turned back, only now looking at what Gabriel was pulling from the flesh sack to throw into the sea. It was babies. Some dead. Others mute and wriggling. All of Gabriel\u2019s mouths were frowning. Like he wanted to find joy in the throws but just couldn\u2019t get there. ",

            "comment": "I could have sworn I had been sitting at a red light just a few seconds ago. Now I\u2019m in some sort of office building, and it seems that whoever runs the place has a sense of humor because there is a big sign that says \u201cWelcome To Hell\u201d on the wall. I wonder if I blacked out i mean I wa- \u201cNEXT!\u201d. Some woman in a pants suit was gesturing at me wildly I\u2019m not sure why, but I think I should follow her.\n\nAccording to the nameplate on her desk her name was Karen, and she didn\u2019t seem to be too happy with me. \u201cYou know atleast the Hitlers of the world had some sort of goal in mind, but not you no you just were to fuckin stupid to call an Uber when you went and got wasted.\u201d She said unenthusiastically, \u201cSorry, but what are you talking about and where am I exactly?\u201d I may have been asking what to me seemed an appropriate question but what I got in response was a rather dramatic eye roll then she just said,\n\u201cYour name Mr. Charles Knight. You\u2019ve been killed in a drunk driving accident. Because you were the drunk one who sped into a cross section before the light turned green - idiot- resulting in the deaths of 3 people you are now at the Hell intake office. Any questions before you are processed? You have 30 seconds\u201d.\nI stammered \u201cb-but I don\u2019t even remember that and this is an office building cmon where are the cameras is this some sort of game show? I mean if it really was hell wouldn\u2019t it be fiery and scary?\u201d, she looked at me for a few seconds before responding, \u201cI knew you were a moron, but really those are your two questions? No this isn\u2019t a game show. No hell as you can see isn\u2019t fiery and scary. You\u2019ll be assigned a studio Apartment in Sector 1309. I suggest you start a hobby or something. Goodbye!\u201d \n\nSuddenly I was standing on a city street with a key in my hand looking up at a building that looked like any other apartment complex in the world except it stretched upward as far as the eye could see. I spotted a man walking down the street and tried to ask where I was \u201cFuck off.\u201d Ok maybe someone else would be a litter more friendly. That\u2019s when I spotted a poster on the wall.\n\n*WELCOME TO HELL to all new arrivals you might be a bit confused. There is no need to be alarmed yes you are in hell, but it isn\u2019t much like you may have heard back on earth. Turns out the only punishment that gets worse with time is boredom so that\u2019s what this place used to be just a bunch of buildings where they locked people up to be bored forever, but when the most conniving minds in history get bored they also get ideas. So about 78 years ago we rebelled, and took over there is no eternal torment here just a pretty average earth society minus the need for food, or sleep, or any of that nonsense. Since you were assigned into SECTOR 1309 it appears you don\u2019t really have any useful skills so feel free to pick up a hobby or attend school. Just enjoy yourself! [if you know anything about Quantum Physics please report to SECTOR 112 we are trying to make a portal to earth and you could be useful in that endeavor]*\n\n\u201cMaybe this won\u2019t be so bad after all. If we can just do whatever we want maybe I\u2019ll take up painting, or oh I wonder what type of porn they have here!\u201d, I mumbled to myself, then there was a blinding flash of light in the sky, and a giant glowing hand reached down out of a portal that had just appeared. *THIS WILL NOT STAND YOU WILL BE PUNISHED AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE* the hand was shot by what appeared to be anti-aircraft cannons, and after taking a pretty good pummeling the portal vanished and the severed arm crashed down to the ground. A woman walking by noticed my surprised expression and said, \u201cOh, sweetie, that happens like every Wednesday don\u2019t worry about it\u201d.",

We were sitting inside a neat little office. The devil and I. Flower wallpapers sprinkled the white walls with tasteful splashes of color. A white cupboard with delicate porcelain plates and cups stood to on side of us. A little vase with some like summer smelling flowers stood between us. There was lemon cake. \n\n\u201cWhich playpen would you like to go?\u201d The devil with the great black horns and loincloth asked again. \n\n\u201cPlaypens, sir?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes. We put the really good dictators into their own little secluded section of hell where they can play tyrant. It really takes a big load of work off our hands, let me tell you that. Someone had the great idea of calling them playpens\u2026 I myself am not entirely sure, whether that is an appropriate name for hell but I am not gonna complain. As long as it works\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo.. I am to choose a dictatorship?\u201d I asked still very uncertain and frankly, quite put off by the faint smell of cinnamon and burned flesh.\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d the devil said.

            "comment": "There are many people down here, you know. Many, misunderstood people that is. At least, that's what I've been told. \n\nYou see, I've only been down here for, what I believe to be, a few days. I have, surprisingly, made a few friends already. This \"Hell\" I have heard preaches about and read books about is nothing like it really is. In fact, I have yet to see one demon, or torturer, or monster, or even the Devil himself. I was kind of just thrown down here. Also, it's pretty cool that I am allowed to keep a journal down here. \n\nI mean,of course this place isn't great by any stretch of the imagination. The place is just a few degrees too warm. Just warm enough to make you complain and feel uncomfortable but not enough to hurt you. The main problem here  is there isn't much to do. Bundy told me that there is going to be a meeting today as to what the humans will do next, whatever the hell that means. I guess I am going to go because I literally have nothing else to do. I will write back about what happens. \n\nObviously, it's going to suck to be here for the rest of eternity, but I think i can make it work. \n\nOkay so, jeez, a lot of crazy shit just went down. There are a lot more people down here than I thought. Bundy got me through to the front of the gathering, so I could see what was happening, but God I did not expect this. \n\nHitler,\n\nLike THE Hitler is here. I mean obviously he was an awful person and all but wow! He is here and he has quite the following. \n\nLet me start from the beginning. Pretty much, this is how it went down. The biggest crowd I've ever seen in my life, and afterlife, crowded around the center of Hell, which, by the way, is just a large crater with pockets of reddish tar, and waited. We waited for what must have been at least 2 days. Then, all of a sudden, a trumpet played. It was just one loud, shrill sound that pierced the noise of the congregation. The sea of people split in two and left a massive opening for something huge to pass through. Next came the most insane display of power that I had ever seen. \n\nHitler and some other people, who I definitely should have known from my high school social studies classes, were riding on what appeared to be a thick black cage. \n\nAs the caravan got closer I could make out a massive red figure- with horns and fangs contained within the cage.\n\nIf this is the devil, I thought to myself, then that is the most stereotypical devil he could possibly be.  \nThe caravan got to the center of the mass of Us and everyone kneeled. A speaker produced a deafening squeak then a \"Hello?\" came from it.\n\n\"Hello is this on?\" said an agitated voice that sounded slightly German.\n\nSomeone below, who I could only assume was Hitler, gave him a thumbs up.\n\n\"As you know,\" he said \"I am Hitler.\"  \nAn unenthusiastic \"Heil Hitler\" was murmured through the crowd. \n\n\"And this here is the Devil Himself!\"  \nNow the crowd roared. \n\n\"This meeting scheduled today is to discuss how we are going to get out of here!\"\n\nOkay a lot more happened but I just got a call from Bundy- I have been invited to a personal feast with Hitler himself! Wish me luck. I will write soon.",

            "comment": "It was just my luck that I had ended up here. First, I died when I overshot a red and got blindsided by a truck. Before I know it, I'm brought before a panel of Angels and Saint Peter himself to be judged. Turns out, I had told six lies too many to qualify me for purgatory, and so I was damned to spend an eternity in Hell. It was a rough start to that week, to say the least.\n\nHell doesn't really do this place justice. I'm told it was pretty bad in the time of the devils by an old soul I met down there after I'd been cast down. Falsely accused his wife of being a witch in the fifteenth century to get rid of her, so he's been there a while. Nice guy, actually, besides the whole wife murder thing. At any rate, during our brief conversation he filled me in on the past few hundred years. Initially, Hell was a city for the fallen angels led by their leader, Beelzebub, and it could cope with the influx of souls they were told to torture by assigning devils to small groups of similar sinners for punishment. However, as thousands turned to millions, and millions to billions, the devils became stretched thin. That's when Beelzebub thought of a brilliant outsourcing method. People such as Genghis Khan and Montezuma were elevated to a semi-devil position, and as time progressed, the worst people of an age were elevated to run such things. Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Nixon, Thatcher- the sky really was the limit.\n\nHowever, things became increasingly fractured as it got out of control from the devils. These groups began working for themselves, some of them all but creating armies of the damned and living like kings. They would take all kinds, and gradually took over areas. It all went to shit when, according to the old man, Beelzebub tried to put a stop to it and restore some power to the devils, and somehow failed so abysmally that all Hell's original Suzerains were either slaughtered or enslaved and kept as power symbols. But the new leaders of Hell never could leave one another alone. Many of them desired control, or just really, really liked violence. And so Hell was cast into civil war. From the Great Khaganate ruled by Genghis Khan and his mongols in the east on the plains of Sheol, to the Thatcherite Empire in the west amonst the hills of Gehenna, Hell was cast into never ending violence. But how does a war work in a place none can die I hear you ask? I hadn't asked, but the old man felt obliged to fill me in. It was a game of numbers and enslavement. No more minions? No more empire. The threat of eternal pain and the possibility of a mediocum of normalcy and comfort were the man things that kept lesser peoples such as myself fighting. Things were bleak to say the least.\n\nBut he had told me there was a way out. Rumor had it that if you crossed the lakes of fire, and kept heading North through the regions of Hades where its terrible mythological beings plagued travelers, via Abbadon which was home to African warlords and exiles from the other empires of Hell, and up to the cold, arctic northern reaches of Hel where many froze to stay immobile in agonizing pain, there you could be judged again and moved to another afterlife away from this underworld. I had decided it was my best option, and waved goodbye to the old man as I began my journey. I started far south though, in Jahannam, where the great valleys were filled with fire and smoke and where boiling water bled through cracks and dribbled into boiling rivers.\n\nIt would be a long journey north.\n\n(This is the first thing I've ever posted here, I know it isn't great or especially well fleshed out and a bit exposition-y, but I had an hour and wanted to write something. I hope those of you who read it, enjoy it!)",

In the distance a child laughed as a young dog bounded up to her with a stick. A bird trilled softly somewhere across the rolling hills. Matt could feel a cool lavender breeze waft past his face as he turned to the equally gaunt boatman:\n\"Uhm, Chairon, was it? Are uh, you sure you brought me to the right place? I mean, it's not my habit to question divine judgement and all, but ain't I s'posed to be in, uh, hell?\"\nThe boatman squinted around, drew a slick tablet from his black robes, and spoke as he scanned it with his dimfire eyes \"Chairon's the horse guy. Trainer of heroes. Disney made him into fat goat guy voiced by Danny Devito. I'm Charon. Wayfarer of souls across the river styx. Disney made me into a skeleton man without lines\" Before Matt could discern whether or not that was irony on the boatswain's flat voice, Charon went on. \"Nope, everything's in order. You're in hell. Looks like it's under new management though... again. Fuck. If you'll excuse me, I have to go figure out who's gonna pay me now, talk with the established authorities on the other side, and ferry...\" he scrolled through his tablet \"Two-hundred thirty three thousand five hundred thirty seven souls accross this river\" He paused to murmur \"Fuck: Myanmar and Yemen are killing me today\" to himself before turning back to Matt \"So if you wouldn't mind sidling along off into whatever hell this is now, I'd like to get on with my meager daily schedule\" Nope. Matt was decided. That wasn't irony in his voice. That was peevish sarcasm. Matt's frame hardened as he bristled:\n\"Listen dude. In case you forgot, I died today, relived all of my sins today, realized I had been a piece of shit in life today, got tossed off the pearly cloud and landed facefirst in the mud at your ferry today, and am in no mood to go off into this without knowing a little bit about what's going on! .... today.\" He took a breath \"So EXCUSE me if this is a bad day for you, but this is literally my worst day. Cut me a break and tell me what the fuck is going on\"\nAs the boatsman's eyes met his, Matt's spine did a creepy kind of tango. Charon's voice emanated as he spoke \"What is one angelic rebel against...\" checking his tablet \"One hundred fourteen billion two hundred fifty three million five hundred forty nine thousand seven hundred fifty two conscious, intelligent rebel mortals that have ultimately been freed from the shackles of death? ... Hitler was an intelligent man Matthew Marbruck. Stalin even moreso. Even Squalbuck the sentient squidlord was smarter than your average heavenly dolphin. And don't forget that Atistotle was never baptized, Plato never prayed for a heavenly father to save him, and Hypatia never prayed to Jesus, Allah, Ganesh, or any of the millions of other other saving principle. Aurelius believed that life stopped when we drew our last breath and our bofies died, and even Constantine (who ushered heaven into the world-stage) committed murder, even genocide, by the thousands, just like Aurelius. Hell is not what you think it is. Death is not what you think it is. Tread carefully, and know that things change.\" He paused, and for a moment, the steel left his spine, the fire left his eyes, and his lips curled into what could have been a smile... long ago. \"I know not what power rules this realm right now, but you will know soon enough. Goodbye Matthew Marbuck, and good luck.\"\nA swish of water around a pole, a rush of mist, a laugh (perhaps?) and Charon disappeared across the river.\nBefore him, rolling hills stretched as far as he could see, full of willows, and birch, and mystery. Above him, tbf e fiery sunset sky faded into inexplicable darkness as it met t bf e river. The child and the dog had disappeared, but the lavender breeze had not. Catching, momentarily, a hint of the feeling he had felt as he hopped a moving cargo train amongst Provence's aromatic, amethyst fields, or rolled stolen, fragrant purple buds into a spliff, Matthew decided that in death, like in life, he would go any way the wind blows. At this point it really didn't matter to him, and it wouldn't... until he knew what 'It' was.\n\nSorry guys. Was planning on finishing, but have to get to an impromptu appointment. Hopefully, you guys will want to hear parts two and three. I'll be by later.",

That plus the view of millions of people screaming and running towards a group of demons. \n\nI tried to keep up while the first humans reached the demons. They may have been dead already but the demons made sure nothing was left. Their claws and teeth went straight true the weak human flesh and bones. \n\nHow would we ever win this war? What change did we have against fallen angels? Demons from hell? It was Alexander the Great himself who had set up this battle plan. Him and his valuable generals. All old rulers themself. Some ruled parts of the earth so long ago nobody rememberd them. Others where more from my time. Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Qadaffi, Putin and so many more. \n\nOver the last 53 years they had worked on a plan to take over Hell itself. First in secret but 53 years is a long time. Slowly their plans started to leak and more and more people wanted to help. Their centuries of experience in battle came together in todays plan. And here i was running. Just running towards demons. Was that the best they could do? \n\nI mean i wouldnt mind getten ripped in peaces. Hell was shitty anyway, but serieus? This was it? At that moment i saw how thousands of humans run over a demon. We where simply to many and to fast. As soon as the dirst demon fell more followed. A deep raw sounded true the vallei of dead. We millions of humans felt a victory. We screamend, we yelled. \n\nMy feet stepped into blood and bones. Human but also demon. I could smell it. Was this it? Was this how we would take over hell? \n\nAt that moment a sound so deeply, so frightening sounded. It made our voices sound like mouses. Again the hair on my skin stood up but this time because of fair. Everybody knew this sound. It was the Devil himself. The angel of death. The nightmare of us all. A shadow casted itself over us. And far above us an dragon like beast apeared. It moved closer. Fastly. \n\nWhile the shadow got darker i saw how in the distance Alexander moved his hands. So far away but still so powerfull. Did he have a plan for this? It must be. Fire came down from satan his mouth. Burning so many of us. It left a burnend highway of ashes towards the end of vallei. With a sharp movement he turned around. Ready for a second run. Right at that moment earth disappeared and man build machines popped up. Stones attached to ropes made of humanparts got shot towards the Devil. Attacking him from the back. At the same time humans riding captured demons flew in, attacking this almighty beast from every side. \n\nAt that moment i myself reach a demon and fight for my dead. Alone i would not stand a change, but we are with so many. I get pushed against the demon and can barely breath. All i can do is bite. So i bite. I will eat myself true his revolting skin. It tastes like nothing i ever tasted before. So discusting, so intense. I feel my bones in my body breaking from all the preasure. I keep eating. I scream, i bite, i cry, i dig. Slowly it gets dark before my eyes. \n\n",

He tried again, then, with words still failing him, shrugged hopelessly.\n\nSteven was exhausted and wilted.  He had been vainly attempting to defend himself to St. Peter's court for nearly an hour.  They had started peppering him with questions, starting with his first conscious decision to smack the fly that landed on his crib.  And they had continued right through to today, when he sold his 'quirky' Bluray player through Craigslist to an unsuspecting buyer.  Steven wasn't really a bad guy, but, more to the increasingly obvious and stressed point, he wasn't a good guy either.  The amount of little things he'd done to benefit himself at someone else's expense vastly and horrifically outnumbered the amount of times he'd put someone else first.  Questions finished, Steven was subjected to a stern lecture on morality and kindness, and then was dealt his judgement.\n\nIt was done; Steven was going to Hell.\n\nThen, with the whisper of a barely audible angelic tone, the court was gone.  A lone angel beckoned Steven turn around, then ushered into what could best be described as a celestial elevator.  Steven looked outward at the white and ivory landscape, somehow both entirely endless and closely comforting, then back at the lone angel.  Steven had just barely thought to perceive a smirk on the angel's face when suddenly he was descending.\n\nSteven's stomach lurched into his throat.  His balance disappeared.  Everything around him was in terrifyingly fast motion.  Despite his best efforts, his body began rotating, slowly, until now he was shooting headfirst downward at an alarming rate.  He began to spin, like a football with a perfect spiral.  He perceived nothing except the change in atmosphere.  White gave way to steel grey, then deep blacks.  Oppressive humidity and pressure.  Breathing became difficult.  A terrible undefinable odour crept in.\n\nThen it all stopped.  Suffering vertigo, dizziness, and blurry vision, Steven's knees gave out beneath him.  He dropped to the ground and retched.  Hard.  Once, twice, three times.  He insides felt shredded.  His head pounded.  Steven collapsed completely to the ground, his breath ragged, and passed out.\n\nNot knowing how much later, Steven awoke.  His vision clearing, Steven managed to stand up and take stock.  He was in a tiny room, dark and cylindrical.  The ceiling was inches above his head, the walls close enough he couldn't stretch both arms out at once.  He turned, and there was a door, framed in red, at the end of a narrow corridor.  As he took a moment to consider staying on this side of it, he unexpectedly found that his back was against the wall, literally.  Now the wall was pushing him, quite insistently, toward the red door.  Steven conceded to go through the door, and the wall gave him some space.  Reaching the door, Steven grabbed the red door knob, feeling it hot and smooth in his hand.  He took a deep breath, gripped the knob tighter, then mustered all his courage to turn it, then open the door.\n\nSteven looked out into Hell.\n\nHe seemed to be standing next to a bar.  The d\u00e9cor was all black and dark grey, but a bunch of people were sitting at it, talking and laughing like it was Friday night after work.  Steven did a double-take, then looked behind him.  The door was closed, and had a sign on it that said \"Toilets\".  Steven looked back at the bar.  The bartender appeared to be demonic, but was chained to the back wall - it appeared to only be allowed enough reach to cover the bar.  \n\nMovement caught Steven's attention.  A couple of guys and a girl were charging their way toward him, enthusiastic and cheering.  They surrounded him, clapping him on the back, heartily welcoming, but in that fake way that sleazy car salesmen were.  Now they hustled him back toward the bar, asking him his favorite drink and beckoning to the barkeep.  Steven sat down, he sipped an ice cold gin and tonic placed there, and looked expectantly at each one in turn.  Rubbing his hands, the most effervescent of the bunch introduced himself as Bob, and told Steven that he was about to hear the story of the time that people rebelled, then took over Hell.\n\n",

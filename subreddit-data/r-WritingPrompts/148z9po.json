    "postText": "Thank you to u/Drop-Of-Jello for the [original prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/zgls28/wp_you_are_a_super_villain_more_of_an_irl_cartoon/)!\n\n***\n\nI, Delether DeLance, am a genius.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s been long over a decade since I first uttered those words, and I\u2019ve learned a few lessons in modesty in that time, but it still holds true. Humility might have also been a good word to use there, but \u201chumility\u201d is far too close to \u201chumiliate\u201d for my tastes. I have only been humiliated once in my life, and it was not my fault.\n\nIt _won\u2019t_ happen again.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s hard when you come to the realization that you\u2019re surrounded by idiots and you\u2019re not even out of elementary school. Not that I _enlightened_ said idiots of my findings. I _was_ raised to be polite. So there I was, surrounded by idiots, bored to tears in school, with no one interesting around me and nothing interesting to do.\n\nSo I did what any other child genius with too much time on their hands does: I checked out several textbooks on robotics from the public library, ransacked a nearby computer graveyard, and decided to secretly build an android in an abandoned warehouse.\n\nI was, of course, wildly successful, and put the measly efforts of university students to shame.\n\n\u2026okay, fine. I admit it. I had a cheat. Namely, technology-based powers. Even with only entry-level knowledge, anything is possible when you can _hear_ the way the electricity flows like an artificial heartbeat, when anything wrong in the wiring grates against your nerves like an itch in the small of your back, like the squeals of too-squeaky chalk on a blackboard.\n\nShe almost looked real when I was done. I\u2019d made her look strong and tall and intelligent, like the big sister I\u2019d always dreamed of, like how I wanted to grow up to be in the future. Yet despite my best efforts, there was still something artificial in the dark wig she wore, in the empty, purple-painted irises surrounding the sensors I\u2019d hidden in her pupils.\n\nI could have turned my efforts towards programming next, to give my android code that would grant her seeming life. But I\u2019d just spent so much effort and time building her, and my childlike patience had reached its max.\n\nSo I tried her on. Slid my consciousness out of my normal skin and into my creation like I was trying on a new pair of clothes.\n\nAnd it _worked._ In the body I\u2019d built, there were no nerves, no sense of pain, but I could feel the bubbly flow of energy keeping her \u201calive.\u201d The movement lagged a bit behind what I wished, but it was still acceptable. I swept the sensors across the room, \u201csaw\u201d things by how far they were from me, by the amount and types of light they reflected. \u201cSaw\u201d myself, curled up on the couch, eyes tightly shut.\n\nAnd then, well, I had a new toy, didn\u2019t I? I had to fully try her out. So still wearing my contraption of metal and wires, I covered my unconscious body with a blanket and went out to play.\n\nMy aim? I wanted to pick a fight with a super.\n\nI\u2019d seen super fights before that, of course, and they\u2019d immediately peaked my interest. A close, tense battle, a chess game played in fractions of a second as they both tried to use their powers to the fullest. I\u2019d always wanted to try it, but no villain would respect a child superhero, and no superhero worth their ideals would be willing to take on a child villain. Besides, while I was interested in the mechanics of fighting, the fighting itself seemed troublesome and painful, particularly for someone who\u2019d never fought before.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of something interesting if you\u2019re going to hurt yourself while you\u2019re at it?\n\nBut now, with my new, adult-sized skin, no one would know my true age. I wouldn\u2019t feel pain, and if things went south, I just had to hide my android and let my consciousness return to my real body. No harm done.\n\nSo I went out and made a little bit of trouble. Made some machines go haywire, let loose the small, insect-like robots I\u2019d tinkered with while experimenting.\n\nLo and behold, a hero came running.\n\nYes, that\u2019s right. I\u2019d decided to become a villain. After all, being a hero is so much _work._ You have to go through all sorts of trouble to find a villain to fight, but if you\u2019re a villain, the hero comes to _you._\n\nI don\u2019t remember who I fought that first day, but it was exhilarating. I lost badly, but I couldn\u2019t get upset. My new metal skin was perfect. My escape plan worked. And besides\u2026\n\nIt was so _interesting._\n\nSuch was the birth of the supervillain, the Machine God.\n\nThat\u2019s what I would do whenever I was bored after that. I would fix up my avatar, as I\u2019d started calling her, or I\u2019d build a few more little robotic minions to scurry around on their needle-thin legs, or I\u2019d put my head down and let myself drift away and into my avatar to make some more mischief. I suppose it was my own fault I gained a reputation for being a distracted, sleepy child. I didn\u2019t care though. This villain business was far more interesting than anything else I\u2019d run across.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was almost in college that I got myself a proper rival\u2014well, _rivals,_ actually. A small, close-knit team of three superheroes who rose up against the Machine God\u2019s reign of terror (I was properly infamous at this point), they called themselves the Wing Knights.\n\nAnd it was so _fun._\n\nFighting against just one super had lost some of its appeal to me. Every newbie, every veteran who wanted to prove themselves threw themselves at me. Winning was getting easier even with the inherent disadvantages of controlling my avatar, and I hated to admit it, but I was starting to get bored again.\n\nBut then came the Wing Knights. They didn\u2019t care about their useless pride, faced me as a group, let their powers weave together into a tapestry to take me down. I started losing again, had to plan better and more ingenious ways to flee as I tried to swallow wild laughter back into my chest. Sometimes I won, but sometimes they even managed to capture my avatar, detaining \u201cme\u201d in their base. Of course, I would quickly slip away, but it had _happened._ They brought me my joy again.\n\nIn a way, they were my friends. We were all young adults around the same age, and we spent our afternoons, our evenings, our weekends together. We knew each other like the back of our hands, and I knew them better than I knew anyone else in the world.\n\nOr at least I thought I did.\n\nIt was one of my losses. They\u2019d come up with a new tactic, and my escape plan had gone less than perfectly. As a consequence, my avatar once again was occupying her designated cell in the home base of the Wing Knights. She was the most beat up she\u2019d ever been, though. Her left arm hung limply from a few dozen wires, and the connection allowing me to control anything below the knees had been severed.\n\nShe\u2019s not going to be able to walk out of this one by herself, I decided. Even with _my_ abilities. I leaned back, prepared to let myself slip loose and back to my body. Prepared to summon an army of small machines to come \u201crescue\u201d my avatar. I\u2019d spent hours on this form\u2014no, it was probably years at this point. There was no chance I\u2019d let the Wing Knights keep their hands on her.\n\nIf I\u2019d been a half-second faster, I would never have seen it, and everything would have stayed the way it was, maybe forever.\n\nBut I _was_ a beat late, so I _did_ see it, and I forgot I was supposed to be returning to my real body.\n\nA loud crash. A muffled whimper of pain. Firebird slammed into the ground in front of my cell, landing in a limp heap. She touted her power as fire, but I knew that wasn\u2019t the case. She was just _invulnerable_ to fire, so she could play with it as much as she liked with no consequences. But that was only when she had access to fire or a firestarter.\n\nAnd I had purposely exhausted her source of fire in our earlier battle.\n\nNow, the woman collapsed in front of me was effectively powerless. She tried to push herself up, spat out blood from a split lip. Footsteps thundered down the hall towards us. Firebird glanced up, flinched.\n\n\u201cC-crane,\u201d she stuttered, and the man himself, the leader of the Wing Knights appeared.\n\nHis face twisted into a sneer, an expression that would have looked far more at home on a villain\u2019s face. \u201cSo useless,\u201d he snorted. \u201cWe outnumber that so-called god, and she brings you to this kind of state? If it hadn\u2019t been for your powers failing, we could have _crushed_ that thing once and for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I-I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t expect\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_Useless._\u201d He flung a hand forward. A wave of force rushed out, slammed Firebird into the wall at the end of the hall. She crumpled again, but this time she didn\u2019t get up.\n\nMy mind blanked. _This_ was Crane? The seemingly gallant leader of my rivals? Imperceptibly, my jaw tightened. My sensors locked onto Firebird. _Come on,_ I thought. _Get up! You always force me into a corner. You can get up from this!_\n\nThe woman didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cCrane,\u201d shouted a voice from behind. Ah, so Roc was just behind. \u201cCan\u2019t you see she\u2019s exhausted? She doesn\u2019t need you hur\u2014doesn\u2019t need any more injuries!\u201d\n\nCrane clicked his tongue. His hand twisted again, and the last member of their super hero team was flung through the air to land next to Firebird. The floor of the base gouged out, but Roc landed on his feet. Oh, that was a creative use of his rock powers. I\u2019d have to keep that in mind next time. Crane rolled his eyes. Another finger twitch. Roc collapsed.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d sneered this _chivalrous_ leader, \u201care no better than her. Today\u2019s victory is only thanks to me. Reflect for a while and count your lucky stars we _did_ win. Remember what I said. My team, my rules.\u201d He turned and stormed out.\n\nSilence in the hallway.\n\n\u201cFirebird?\u201d Roc finally called softly.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she groaned. \u201cI\u2019m alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was able to cushion it with my arms this time. It didn\u2019t hit the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. But I keep telling you, we need to quit.\u201d\n\nFirebird grimaced. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not possible. If we do that, what happened today will be nothing.\u201d\n\nThis\u2026 _this_ time?\n\nSparks violently jumped from my avatar\u2019s exposed wires.\n\nI saw lighting.\n\nI opened my eyes to the ceiling in my workshop. My jaw hurt from clenching it too hard. Heat wreathed my head.\n\nI sneered. It seemed I had more business at the Wing Knights\u2019 base than just retrieving my avatar. Crane thought he was so hot just because he could defeat my avatar and a few insects?\n\nIt seems he\u2019d forgotten that I was the Machine _God._ After all, gods only send avatars into the mortal world out of consideration.\n\nOtherwise, the havoc would be unimaginable.\n\nA few minutes later, and I surveyed myself. As I\u2019d never felt the need to go out as the Machine God in my own skin before, I didn\u2019t have a proper suit, and the robotic parts I\u2019d scrounged together were somewhat incoherent. I wasn\u2019t completely unmuscular thanks to a particularly annoying classmate who always dragged me out to exercise in an attempt to fix my \u201csleeping\u201d habits, but the addition of these parts nicely supplemented my overall squishy and vulnerable real body.\n\nI flexed my wrist. Electricity flickered in the parts, perfectly mimicking my movement like another layer of skin. Good. This would do. I snapped the mirrored visor I\u2019d removed from a motorcycle helmet down over my eyes, and stepped out towards the door, a few of my robotic creations emerging from the corners to join me. I\u2019d gain more company as I got closer to the Wing Knight\u2019s hideout.\n\nMy minions were everywhere in this city.\n\n***\n\nThe door to the hideout was keypad-locked and electronic. I snickered. That wasn\u2019t even _defense_ against me. The barest thread of my consciousness slipped into the wiring. I redirected the current with a thought.\n\nA click. The door swung open before me. I entered, followed by a surging, dark sea of clicking spindly legs.\n\nI found the nearest security camera in the corner. Another thread of consciousness slid into the device, tracing the connection back to the computer that ran them. There. A room in the back.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d I commanded my creations. A small unit peeled off and clattered down the hallway.\n\nI myself turned the opposite way, towards the cell my avatar occupied, towards the place where Firebird and Roc sat, bruised and bleeding.\n\nA tingle in the back of my mind. The robots had reached the computer room. I took a glance at the information I received.\n\n\u2026the computer was unlocked, not even encrypted. Crane really was _determined_ to make this easy for me, wasn\u2019t he?\n\n_Download everything,_ I told them. I didn\u2019t have time to search through the footage. That would come later. For now, I just had to retrieve the evidence, guarantee Firebird and Roc\u2019s safety, and give Crane a warning.\n\nOh, and rescue my avatar, of course. That went without saying.\n\nAnother nominally locked electronic door later and my march brought me to the Wing Knights. Firebird and Roc had emerged, and Crane had started in again. Roc was already a still heap on the ground. My jaw clenched. Was he already this much worse when it had been barely forty minutes since I\u2019d last seen them?\n\nFirebird was on her feet, but also worse for wear, gritting her teeth even as Crane stepped forward, a force-laden punch at the ready.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep doing this,\u201d he taunted, \u201cuntil you can avoid it. How useless can you be, not being able to avoid even a single punch? I bet we\u2019d have beaten that Machine thing already if you could avoid this kind of punch\u201d\n\nShe looked up. Her eyes widened in panic\u2014not because of the punch, but because of me, the unexpected invader who suddenly appeared in her vision.\n\nFirebird opened her mouth. \u201cCrane,\u201d she tried to warn.\n\nHe ignored her.  A twist in his hips signaled the start of his move.\n\nI sighed, engaged the robotics in my partial-armor, and kicked his legs out from underneath him.\n\nHe teetered, lost control of his power. The force from the half-complete punch careened downwards, rebounded up. Into _him._\n\nAlready off-balance, his own power threw him into the wall like a ragdoll.\n\nHelpless, Firebird limped forward a step.\n\nI bent over the super fallen at my feet, a cold smile growing across my lips. \u201cHello, Crane. Your power hurts when it hits, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThe two conscious heroes froze. I took that second to wriggle into the last lock between me and my avatar.\n\n\u201cFetch my avatar,\u201d I commanded another splinter of my forces. The stronger ones skittered away this time, scuttling through the door I\u2019d already opened.\n\nFirebird figured it out first. \u201cMachine\u2026 God\u2026?\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cOf course. You do have something of mine, after all.\u201d Crane groaned and tried to push himself to his feet. Calmly, I slammed a foot into his back, right over the lungs. He collapsed, coughing.\n\nAnother lurching step brought Firebird closer. \u201cBut we\u2019ve captured you\u2026 captured your _avatar_ before. But you\u2019ve never come in person.\u201d I could see her better now, could see the scratches on her wrists, the heightened vigilance etched onto her face.\n\nI removed my foot, crouching down to stare into Crane\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou see, there\u2019s something you don\u2019t seem to understand, so I needed to come myself to make sure it\u2019s ingrained properly.\u201d I let my voice drop and grow edges, raising my hand to point towards the unconscious Roc, the injured Firebird. \u201c_No one_ is allowed to beat them up but _me._ Do you understand?\u201d\n\nShock painted Crane\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re a _villain!_\u201d\n\nI sneered. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a hero. Aren\u2019t rules what you heroes do? Well, one of the rules is that injuring Firebird and Roc is the sole purview of the Machine God. I was having fun playing with you all. But now\u2026 I\u2019m angry. And I\u2019m not so _tolerant_ of people playing with my bottom line when I\u2019m angry.\u201d\n\nMechanical clatters echoed from the open door, and the robots bearing my damaged avatar poured out. I took my gaze away from Crane just long enough to wave them out of the compound. \u201cTake her back. Workshop 2.\u201d\n\nA faint ping reached me. It seems my little data thieves were done with their work, too. I turned my attention back to the man who was trying to sneak attack me. A minimal movement, honed over years of fighting, twisted his attack away. Another thud as Crane spun back into the wall.\n\nI sighed, taking a brief moment to appreciate the lack of lag before continuing. \u201cSince you can\u2019t even understand a simple rule like that, let me lay out a few more things for you. The first time you break my rules, I might even be called forgiving. The second time you break my rules\u2026\u201d I yanked off his mask.\n\nHe paled. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d he protested. \u201cThere are laws! If you spread my identity around no one will let you get away with it! You\u2019ll be hunted down by every super in the area!\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said I was planning to disseminate this information, did I? This is merely\u2026what do you call it? Insurance?\u201d I let my voice drop further. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see your face in my business again. I don\u2019t want to see your face in _their_ business again, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw everything, Crane. Now\u201d\u2014I threw his mask down at his feet\u2014\u201cplease enjoy what\u2019s left of your reputation while you have it. I made a copy of the footage from those cute little cameras you have everywhere, and I\u2019ll be putting it to good use. Don\u2019t think you can escape my notice. I let quite a bit slide because it was interesting, but now I have friends to protect.\u201d\n\nAnother attempt to rise made him flop like a fish. When it failed, he resorted to scowling. \u201cFriends? With you? Ha! You\u2019re a villain!\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I replied steadily. \u201cBut I care more about their safety than you do. Do I make myself clear?\u201d The movement of his flopping torso exaggerated, Crane attempting to cling to his last imagined vestiges of dignity. But getting hit with his own power had taken it out of him. Hmph. He didn\u2019t even have as much willpower as the heroes he insulted as weak. \u201cDo I make myself clear?\u201d I repeated, letting a section of one of my robotic gauntlets pop outwards in a flash of movement. The fear of the unknown device sitting at his throat turned him pale.\n\n\u201cY-yes,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d I rose to my feet and kicked him for good measure. It was the last straw. His eyes rolled back into his head, his limbs fell limply to the ground. I turned to leave. Suddenly, I met Firebird\u2019s eyes, an unconscious Roc now draped across her shoulders. I nodded politely, stepping past her.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d she cried. I glanced over my shoulder. Her mouth wrinkled as she struggled for words. \u201cThank you,\u201d she replied eventually. \u201cAnd\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll see you in lab tomorrow.\u201d\n\nI froze. My identity. Somehow, she knew my identity. \u201c...how?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one-way mirror paint on your visor\u201d\u2014she tapped the left side of her face\u2014\u201cit\u2019s degraded here. So I caught a glimpse from the side. I don\u2019t think Crane did, though. I\u2026\u201d She took a deep breath and smiled. \u201cI won\u2019t tell. I know you\u2019re a villain, but oddly, I think I can trust you. Can I come find you? I need a lab partner.\u201d\n\nI forced the hands that started shaking into fists. Tried to tell myself that it was just exhaustion, that I hadn\u2019t spent so much effort as myself before.\n\nI turned away, hiding the shaking that only doubled as I ignored it. My identity was a weakness. I should treat Firebird like Crane would treat me if he were smart. Carefully, and kept at a distance.\n\n\u2026no.\n\nEven if I deluded myself into thinking that the connection between rivals was more than just hatred, even if she wasn\u2019t actually a friend, maybe\u2026 maybe she could _become_ one. I opened my mouth, trying to pull words out of my throat. Finally, I mustered a quiet voice.\n\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIf you liked this, you might find other stuff you like on r/chanceofwords!

Yes, the PJ Masks characters are younger and have different powers, but I couldn't help but be reminded of it. And not everybody is simple-minded as in a lot of popular kids' cartoons. Would make for an interesting other story... Starting off as a kids' story with primary school super heroes slowly realizing that the super hero business is no piece of cake, that the villains are actually competent and that losing really hurts and mistakes can kill.",

Although the tone of the individual stories varies between lighthearted and serious, whenever I write in this universe, I always try to write the main characters as *humans* first, and heroes/villains second, and humans tend to have complex, not black-and-white motivations for whatever they do. So I tend to end up with villains who aren't entirely villainous, and heroes who don't necessarily have heroic motivations (or in Crane's case, heroes who are really only heroes in name).\n\nI'm glad you liked it!",

And of course the -IMO- wrong idea \"why should we teach kids complex topics, they're just kids\". But your story feels like it is how PJ Masks should be. No black and white, complexity, pain and suffering, a sense of justice",

I could see the character definitely being less a super villain and more an anti-hero in the literal sense. \n\nVigilante who causes mischief, but refuses to do actual, lasting harm out of want. Like here, M.G. could have moved on, but there's a morality that spoke and said \"no, a lesson needs taught today\" and with Firebird's (and Roc's?) influence it could even become a sort of basis for action. \n\nAlso, I was skeptical on Wing Knight's as a title, but Firebird was a good foundation, Crane was (to me) an odd choice, but Roc was a clever play on words that just sold the whole package. Call me simple, but I loved it. \n\nI hope to see more from this set of characters! Thanks for sharing.",

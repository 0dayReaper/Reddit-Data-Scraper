I do make sure to include whether the location is rural, urban, suburban and the natural environment such as forested, mountainous, arid, or what not. Most of the time the exact city or country is not super important for my stories. This will probably change the more I travel and the longer I live in a cities or in specific areas with distinct properties.",

            "comment": "I think similar to a song, I try to make the setting where the audience most naturally imagines it to be. I want it to match the mood, and I always do this unless I'm writing a story where something's off (Unreliable Narrator usually), then I juxtapose the setting and the mood. \n\nFor example, I wrote a poem 2 days ago about shadows. The underlying idea is someone who is waiting, and their mind starts to drift to ponder if a shadow is a reflection, what it means to live as a shadow, and if there's a 'true form' among the many shadows created when we're cast by different lights.  \n\nIn one line I say \"With the cracked concrete they play fetch\", in what is basically the only piece of setting in the entire poem. I put fetch to make people think about when they were kids, and concrete in the same line to have the audience remember those hot days outside, where for a second of boredom or curiosity our eyes meet the pavement we're on and we have just the tiniest, fleeting thought of playing with shadows. \n\nWhen two characters in my story use the thousands of years of culture and memory passed down to them by their ancestors, in order to be real and honest and free, I put them in the mountains. I think it helps carry that idea of \"Something bigger than yourself\".",

I hope there are other weekenders still checking out this thread.\n\nxwhy here, from r/xwhy (comments welcome, I know everything's a little old over there, but school's almost out).\n\nWhere I set stories has something to do with whatever prompted it. Many times, it's generic fantasy and the town is secondary. Or it's on a spaceship, in which case, I might scout out nearby stars to see where it may be traveling to. Other times, it's set in a city the size of Brooklyn, or a town the size of a neighborhood in Brooklyn (or what I remember from towns where some aunt, uncle and/or cousin lived). \n\nI'd love to set some things in a generic \"old west\" town, but my attempts are usually as cardboard as the movie sets I'm basing them on.\n\nBut sometimes, a prompt sounds like it would work well in the world of a previous story.\n\nI don't go scouting for those prompts, but it's nice to know I have a magic academy and with a town nearby, or a diner with demonic creatures in it (usually played for laughs), or a couple of Central City/Star City places for the occasional hero to traipse about in.\n\nThat's about it. Usually when a story idea occurs, the location comes along with it, and then it's a matter of can I fill in enough of the details so that there's a sense of things in the gaps. \n\nAgain, r/xwhy, please read, comment and enjoy.",

            "comment": "The decision on *where* to set my stories often depends on the prompt or theme I am writing for.  Broadly speaking, I tend to find myself pulled towards more Urban settings since they are the most familiar in my adult life experiences plus they have a high degree of variety-density available (eg: you can have a 'Chinatown' on one city block, turn a corner, and be in a 'Little Italy').  \n\nUrban settings need not be realistic or contemporary either and there is ample variety in past, present, future, fantasy, sci-fi, and other genres where it can be easy to apply.  Most notably, the spec-fic realm of \"superheroes\" lends itself easily to an urban setting due to the plethora of examples of heroes working in such areas.  Batman in Gotham, Superman in Metropolis, Marvel's New York City, etc.\n\nIf I am not writing in a city, I enjoy exploring the wilderness in my stories.  Mostly magical and fantasy-centered in those cases.  The Wild Weird West is a fun one, or a magic forest with glowing flowers and singing mushrooms, any place where I can put a fun and vibrant spin on something familiar.",

            "comment": "We raced around the corner in our stolen Humvee, tipping onto two wheels for a few dangerous moments before slamming back onto the ground. The vehicle groaned, stressed even despite its robust, Mil-Spec design. Maybe it wasn\u2019t designed for fighting zombie, I don\u2019t know. Accelerating down the street, I looked over my shoulder, taking my eyes off the road for a few precious seconds. My eyes caught a glimpse of a few of the faster ones rounding the corner in the distance before there was a sickening lurch, and we were airborne. As we slammed into the ground my lip got caught between my teeth, and I felt the coppery taste of blood fill my mouth.   \n  \nMaybe I should explain how I got here. The day started out normally enough. I woke up fairly late, having the day both off of school and work, an unusual combination for me. Stretching, I reached for my phone, checking for notifications. The only thing I saw was a post I\u2019d been tagged in on Facebook. Shrugging, I opened it up, figuring I had a few minutes before I needed to start my day. It was one of those \u201cWho would be in your post-apocalypse team\u201d posts. I shrugged, and had almost closed the app when I realized that the pictures weren\u2019t the standard action heroes and celebrities. In fact, they were religious figures like Mohammed, Jesus, Satan, and The Flying Spaghetti Monster. I snorted, but started typing my comment. Hitting the post button, I went to shower and eat breakfast.    \n  \nAs I finished eating, my doorbell rang. Looking up at the clock quizzically, I stood up to go check who it was. I wasn\u2019t expecting a delivery or company, so no one should have been at the door. I looked out the peephole, and was even more confused. A man, dressed in a white robe with a red sash, stood outside, checking his phone. I almost didn\u2019t answer the door, but something about the way he was dressed had me curious. Opening the door, I left the screen door closed.    \n  \n\u201cUh, hi. Who are you?\u201d  \n  \nThe man looked up, his eyes piercing and almost luminescent. \u201cMy name is Jesus. Jesus Christ. You said you needed a post-apocalyptic survival team?\u201d  \n  \n\u201cI mean, I did reply to that- hey wait a minute, are you stalking me on Facebook?\u201d  \n\n \nSnorting, he shakes his head. \u201cNo, but the apocalypse is scheduled to start in about 5 minutes. We should go inside for the first part, otherwise this will be a very short lived team.\u201d  \n  \nI almost slammed the door, but then I looked past him. A white McLaren was parked at the curb, and a dark red one was pulling up behind it. My eyes widened as a man with red skin in a suit stepped out. Looking at my mailbox, he checked his phone and nodded. Walking up my driveway, he inclined his head to the man already outside my door as he stopped next to him.  \n  \n\u201cHello Jesus, long time no see,\u201d he said, looking down at his phone and typing something.  \n  \n\n\u201cSatan, it has been a while.\u201d The man in the white robe turned to look at me. \u201cWell, are you going to let us in? We\u2019re down to about 3 minutes. Buddha will be a bit late, he always is.\u201d  \n\nI stared at them both, and then the cars again. Much as I didn\u2019t want to let them in, I wanted to know why two guys dressed like they were had cars that nice. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t hurt? I knew that saying that probably made my chances of it going well worse, but my chances probably weren\u2019t high to begin with. Opening the door, I stepped to the side wordlessly. They walked in, checking their phones. The one in the suit closed the door behind him, still on his phone. Looking up to me staring, he winked and walked into the living room after the one in the robe.  \n   \nFollowing them, I kept scratching my head. I shouldn\u2019t have let them in my house. Why did I do that? Why wasn\u2019t I asking them to leave? Before I could follow that train of thought, their phones started blaring a warning klaxon at the same time. The one in the suit just kept typing, and the one in the robe swiped away a notification without looking at it as their phones stopped the noise.  \n   \n\u201cWell, here we go,\u201d the one in the robe said, looking out the window.\nLooking outside with him, my jaw dropped. The sky had turned a dark gray color, and there were columns of light scattered about. What looking like people were rising up the columns through the clouds and disappearing. I opened the window and looked around, but it was definitely real.  \n   \n\u201cI have to be going crazy. That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.\u201d I started breathing heavily, my head pounding. Suddenly, there was a new knock on the door, and I felt a calming presence outside. The other two nodded.  \n  \n\u201cThere he is. Why does being at peace come with the inability to be anywhere on time?\u201d the man in the suit said it as he put his phone away.  \n   \nThe man in the robe shrugged. \u201cNo idea, but at least we can get started. Do you think he got it?\u201d  \n  \nShrugging, the man in the suit headed towards the door. \u201cNo idea, but we need to leave. It won\u2019t be safe here for much longer.\u201d  \n  \nI stared back and forth between them, bewildered. I still felt that odd feeling of peace, despite my apparent mental breakdown, but it was as if something nearby was telling me it didn\u2019t matter, and that it would be all right. The man in the robe followed the one in the suit, and I followed the two of them, hoping they\u2019d leave and my mental break would end.  \n  \nInstead, they opened the front door, and a man in an orange robe was standing out front, whistling. He was jingling a set of keys, and he broke into a wide smile when he saw us.  \n   \n\u201cAh, so you are still here. Good, I wasn\u2019t sure. Come, I found the vehicle you wanted. The soldiers using it didn\u2019t seem to have much need for it with the chaos around them.\u201d  \n   \nI looked behind him to see what he was talking about, and my jaw dropped. There was a Humvee parked on my lawn, with the U.S. flag painted on the doors, and what appeared to be a machine gun on the roof. Staring at it, I swallowed hard.  \n  \n\u201cWhat the fuck is that Humvee doing on my lawn? Are you guys insane? Or am I actually hallucinating?\u201d  \n  \nAll three of them looked at me at the same time and the orange one spoke up. \u201cWe know you don\u2019t understand. Let me keep it simple. That post you replied to this morning? It was a legitimate question. You picked us first, so you get to have us. I am Buddha, and this man in the suit is Satan, and the other one is Jesus. We\u2019ll keep you safe, or at least try our best. Now, let us go, the zombie are about to come around the corner.\u201d  \n  \nI opened my mouth to say something, and then there was a crash. Looking around, I saw a door fall flat on the sidewalk, and a shambling figure step out of it. It was very clearly missing body parts it really, really should have had. Grabbing my jacket, I held my hand out for the keys.   \n  \n\u201cFine, but I\u2019m driving.\u201d My voice was surprisingly steady and calm.\nThey looked at each other, finally shrugging. The one in the orange robe, Buddha I guess, tossed the keys to me. I slid into the drivers seat as Satan took the passenger seat while Buddha and Jesus took the back seats. Starting the Humvee, I stepped on the gas and headed for down town.  \n   \n\u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d I asked as I drove, belatedly realizing I had no idea where we were going.  \n  \n\u201cThe Downtown mall. It\u2019ll be full of people, but we need supplies, and we have an advantage on our side,\u201d Satan said casually, eyeing the rearview mirror.  \n  \nNodding, I sped up and headed onto the freeway. Passing more of those shambling figures from time to time, we also saw survivors who waved at us for help. We didn\u2019t stop until the crash.  \n  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpitting the blood out of my mouth and out the window, I turned to see what had happened. It looked like I\u2019d hit a median, and it had launched us into the air. Luckily, I\u2019d hit it at just the right angle to keep us on track. The bad news was, we were surrounded by zombies, and they were getting closer. Looking around in a panic, my gaze stopped on Buddha.  \n  \n\u201cWe can help you. All you have to do is ask.\u201d \nHe said it simply, but I suddenly understood what I was doing wrong. A plan sprung to mind, and I started firing out orders as I started to switch seats.  \n   \n\u201cJesus, take the wheel. Satan, get behind me, I\u2019m riding shotgun. Buddha\u2026 man the .50 cal.\u201d  \n  \n------------------\n  \nHope you guys liked my post! I decided to give this one a shot because I haven't written in a while, and this seemed like a fun place to start. I welcome any feedback or criticism you may have, and happy writing!\n  \nEDIT: Just learned Humvee\u2019s don\u2019t have keys. Oops. ",

            "comment": "The three looked between each other.  There was no more time for words.  No more words were necessary.  \n\nThey knew their places.\n\nJesus swung into the driver's seat.  It was the only real place for him, and there wasn't another option, when it came right down to it.  Buddha didn't fit behind the wheel, and they'd both seen Satan at work on that flask inside his jacket through the day.  No, Jesus would handle it.\n\nTheir wheels spun on the gravel.  The others were circling, now.  It was time.  The final battle, the final fight to see who would win the game once and for all.  Jesus and Satan teaming up was a given.  The other candidates had complained - it wasn't fair - but complaining got them nowhere.  \n\nThey all tried to pretend like they weren't going to do the exact same thing as soon as the opportunity presented itself.  They looked between each other edgily, sizing the competition up.  Picking teams.\n\nBuddha, on the other hand, was a surprise.  What incentive did *he* have for working together with the terrible twosome?  His smooth, expressionless face gave no hint of an answer as he clambered all the way up behind the gun mounted in the truck bed.  His bare feet were steady on the metal floor, perfectly centered even as his girth swung disconcertingly.  \n\n\"Here they come!\" Satan roared.  He had elected himself shot-caller, of course, even though they hadn't set teams.  Neither of the other two were surprised by *that*, either.  He'd always needed to have the last word on things.\n\nThe first contenders were approaching.  Muhammed was out front, leaning out the side door of a torn-up station wagon.  He clutched a rocket launcher in his hands.  They could see Shiva behind the wheel, grinning like a madcap as he spun the wheel.  The overburdened little car nearabouts rode up on two wheels as they whipped into a donut.\n\n\"Shoot!  Shoot!  Now, goddammit!  Why aren't you shooting yet?!\"  Satan screamed.  Jesus gritted his teeth, choosing to ignore the fact that his father's name was being taken in vain alongside him.  Buddha was just watching, sizing up the shot.  And then his meaty finger gripped the trigger.\n\nThe roar of the gun was deafening.  Satan clapped his hands over his ears, roaring with laughter as the gleaming, glowing rounds arced out towards the station wagon.  Shiva was swearing - they could see that much, even though his words were lost to distance and the racket.  But they were spinning too fast.  The ground between them erupted into shredded sand and mud.\n\nMuhammed wasn't waiting anymore.  A plume of fire shot from the rocket launcher.\n\nEverything happened all at once, after that.\n\n\"Satan!\"  Jesus cried.  He, too, was turning now, but there was only so much he could be expected to do.  He was supposed to be positioning them to attack.  Defending them was-\n\n\"I got it, I got it!  Don't get your robes in a bunch.\"  Satan hissed.  Defending them was *his* job.  He lurched dangerously in his seat, barely holding on.  But he pulled his hand up into an almost-level position, mimicking a gun.\n\n\"Bang.\"\n\nRed circles appeared endlessly around their truck.  Something was coming up from underground.\n\n\"*Damn* it, Satan.  Do you have to-\"\n\n\"Don't complain, big guy.  Left.  Left.  Go-\"\n\nThe truck whipped into a left-hand turn, narrowly avoiding the black pillars shooting up around them.  Jesus shook his head.\n\n\"I've *got it*.  Stop backseat driving.\"\n\nThe other teams were coalescing, now.  One after another, the deities were lining up for the big fight.  They all knew.  Whoever won this, would win the world.  And none of them wanted to lose.\n\nHe could almost see them, if he squinted.  Four sets of hooves, barely visible under the cloudline where they floated.  Watching.  Waiting.  The final fight, for whoever crushed the competition here.\n\nHe winced.  The little station wagon had just been slammed by a hummer.  He could see Ra through the front window, glowing faintly from the shit-eating grin on his face.  Oddly noodle-like tentacles were swarming out of the vehicle, attaching themselves to the station wagon.  Which seemed to be *vanishing* into the mass of pasta.\n\n\"Drive!  Drive!\"  Satan screamed in his ear.  The roar of the chaingun from the truck bed was almost a constant companion, now.  \n\nJesus grinned, flexing his hands on the wheel.\n\nAnd then he drove.\n\n(/r/inorai, critiques always welcome.  And going to head it off, I know that Buddha isn't really the fat jolly man statue most people associate with it, but, *most people associate that with him*.)\n\n~~Note - Another part or two is a possibility tonight when I get home, although this won't for obvious reasons be a long term project beyond that.  If you want to be notified *should* that second part happen, leave a comment in the thread about this post on my sub.  It's linked above :) I will notify anyone in that thread re: updates.~~\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Inorai/comments/7dc6op/heavenly_pubg_part_2)",

IMO it takes more skill than people think to write a gripping action scene, and you deftly avoided all the common pitfalls and managed to pull off an awesome, creative piece of writing. Bravo! Perhaps I am being dense, but could you (or anyone else who is sharper than me) elaborate on the obvious reasons why it won't be a long-term project? I kinda assumed you weren't going to make this into a novel or anything, but the fact you said there's an obvious reason why not has made me wonder what I'm missing now. ",

The shadows grew into reaching arms, hiding the true enemy we tried to outrun: Man.\n\n\nBut to say that is facetious, I suppose. What enemies had we that we did not cultivate ourselves? The pot had boiled over and the world was full of steam and hate. They needed someone to batter, to release all the hell we put them through.\n\n\nSirens flared behind. The police cars were gaining. \n\n\n\"Hurry Christ! Goddamn it hurry!\"\n\n\n\"Oh Father, oh Father, oh Father...\"\n\n\nHe could not drive. He was a short man. His hair was oily, thick and short. \n\n\n*Had you cared to come back, they would not have accepted you,* I thought.\n\n\nI felt almost sorry for him.\n\n\n\"Can't take the heat?\" said Lucifer.\n\n\nOf all of us he was the one who enjoyed. They did not have to believe in him when they acted out his will freely.\n\n\n\"Why are you even here?\" I asked him. \"You cannot die.\"\n\n\n\"Why are you here?\" he asked.\n\n\nGunshots rang like nearby thunder. The sky was red and dark.\n\n\n\"I... I...\"\n\n\nI did not know how to answer him. I was a man. I had no memories from before. I had awoken with them, us failures.\n\n\n\"A man amongst gods!\" Lucifer screamed.\n\n\nBuddha was firing. I wondered why he would do that. Was he not a pacifist? \n\n\nFrom the burning carcass of the explosion we had caused, there were ghostly things, shadows rising like clouds, giving chase above the cars.\n\n\n\"What is happening?\" Jesus asked.\n\n\nBack then I did not know. I won't lie and say I have all the answers now, but I think I know better. Those were growing pains that caused the earthquake. A build up of some kind had ripped the city open. The fires sprouted in vast columns. Many were dead. More were dying.\n\n\nI think the world had given up waiting, or reached its seams. What gods shaped it, had never come. And then it was time to move on.\n\n\nJesus turned off the highway. A bullet pierced the back glass. I felt the heat of my blood pour in slow rivers everywhere. My head hurt.\n\n\n*So I can die,* I thought.\n\n\n\"Why are they hunting us?\" Buddha cried.\n\n\nHe fired his gun. Rubber squealed. A car ran off and hit the barricade.\n\n\n\"My children,\" cried Christ.\n\n\nI admit I was angry then. Lucifer was laughing, feeding off my hate.\n\n\n\"You should not have abandoned them!\" I screamed. \"Why did you?\"\n\n\n\"I would have come back!\" screamed Jesus. \"They needed patience.\"\n\n\n\"I never left them,\" said Buddha. \"And who are you anyway to question the divine?\"\n\n\nI remained quiet. We were near the suburbs. Jesus slowed to a crash on a light pole. The sparks left tracers in the falling dark. Lucifer suffered whiplash and he would not move. He was a skinny man with bony features and thin hair.\n\n\n\"Leave him,\" said Jesus. \"Let them take his scum.\"\n\n\n\"No, we cannot!\" I said.\n\n\nThey were running without me. Buddha had lost his gun. They limped past the gathered few and their was a catching frenzy. Many of the people had lost their loved ones that morning. The news had blamed us already.\n\n\n\"There they are!\"\n\n\nA man pointed his gun at me.\n\n\n\"The other terrorists went that way,\" he said.\n\n\nI backed away from Lucifer. He was hardly breathing. He would never truly die. Not in this world.\n\n\n\"You terrorist scum!\" the man said.\n\n\nHe was shaking. Others surrounded me. Jesus and Buddha had gone. They had always been gone, I imagine.\n\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"I'm not a terrorist. I'm...\"\n\n\nI had no name. \n\n\n\"I'm Stephen,\" I said.\n\n\nThe name had just come. The man's gun trembled.\n\n\n\"Stephen? Stephen who?\"\n\n\nOthers from the crowd began to call out other names, as though I had said them.\n\n\n\"Patrick?\"\n\n\n\"Did he say Mike? Mikey?\"\n\n\nI looked at the old man with his gun. The police were coming, the wall of fire rising into smoke. The shadow monsters raced past overhead. They were a hunting black, hunting the fallen gods.\n\n\nThe old man was fighting tears. \n\n\n\"What's your name?\" he asked.\n\n\nI could tell he would not ask again.\n\n\n\"Stephen Algiers,\" I said.\n\n\nIt just come, and then was gone like a fleeting warmth against confusion's cold.\n\n\nThe man dropped the gun.\n\n\n\"Stephen,\" he said. \n\n\nHe ran to me and hugged me. The others had heard different names.\n\n\n\"Baby!\"\n\n\nThey all embraced me, holding on to me as though they were the only ones to do so.\n\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked.\n\n\n\"I thought you died in the earthquake, son.\"\n\n\nThey all thought I was another. I was always someone who had died. I was the miracle, their catalyst for hope.\n\n\nThe police reacted the same. They brought ambulances for me, and continued the hunt for the gods. I could feel their presence within me. Lucifer suffered as they embraced me. They took him away. There was no shadow hunting him.\n\n\nThe others were caught, but not by men. As the fires dwindled and the sky became a stained black, I lost their feeling within. They were ghosts once more, Jesus and Buddha, a memory that had been taken by the shadows. I cannot explain it any other way.\n\n\nThey put me wherever I wanted to be. I had no home, and so I stayed at a shelter. Then I stayed at their homes. Each person saw in me something they had lost; someone they had longed for.\n\n\n\"Can't you see?\" I asked, but they only saw what they wanted to.\n\n\nThe city rebuilt itself slowly. The churches dwindled. Prayer dissolved into smoke, until it became taboo, and then forgotten. I think about what happened, and yet no answer comes, a vague picture forms.\n\n\nI think maybe the Earth had grown too long in one way. The gods had shaped it, but they had long gone. That shape was breaking, the Earth needing to grow in a new way. No longer did it receive the nurturing the gods had given. Too much time had passed.\n\n\nAnd so it broke free. All that pent up hate and frustration had fueled the fires. The virus of the gods needed to be purged. And the Earth purged them. I was left alone.\n\n\nWho am I, this amnesiac fool? There is no answer. I have no self. I think I am the seed that survives the destruction. The seed that can plant hope, and sprout new gods if I so please. For it is belief that makes them. Belief creates a tangible thing, the shaper of our world.\n\n\nI can get them to believe again and start everything over. It is simple.\n\n\n\"How did you survive?\" they always ask.\n\n\n\"God saved me,\" I can say.\n\n\nBut I don't. I have not. I am not sure I ever will. I let the questions linger and let their relief fill that aching void. They hold me for the time they have. Deep down they must know I am not who they truly miss, but the illusion helps. Hope heals, and that is the greatest miracle of all.\n\n\nAnd so I live these days for others. I listen for the gods as the world moves on. I hear only an empty silence.\n\n\n-\n\n\n*Hi there!

            "comment": "**7 MONTHS AGO**\n\nSteve watched the end of civilization descend upon him at 20 times the speed of sound. A dozen spindles of light seemed to blossom from a single point in the night sky before streaking down toward the city.\n\n*So this is it. This is how we all die.*\n\nThe first of the MIRVs detonated several miles away, but even from that distance the light was unbearable. Steve felt a rising wave of heat rush across his skin.\n\n*Jesus... Buddha... Satan... somebody!* \n\nThere was another flash, this time much closer. And with that, Steve was gone.\n\n----\n\n**PRESENT DAY**\n\nDust billowed into the air behind an armored pickup truck as it sped westward through the desert, chasing the last rays of the setting sun. Jesus had the wheel in a white-knuckled deathgrip. The fuel gauge had stopped working weeks ago, but he knew there wasn't enough to make it. The steel plates Steve had welded to the frame were great at stopping small arms fire, but they didn't help the aging vehicle's already poor gas mileage.\n\n\"... Sid, lay down some fuckin' fire!\"\n\nSiddhartha's reply came a moment later as the M2 roared, tracer rounds piercing the cloud of dust behind them. Sparks and tracers ricocheting in the darkness announced that the Buddha's last burst had struck home. Leaving a trail of burning fuel, the closest of the pursuing trucks veered to the right and began tumbling violently.\n\n\"To live is to suffer, motherfucker!\"\n\nThe Buddha's maniacal laughter was interrupted by ever-longer bursts of automatic fire. Steve and Jesus exchanged a knowing glance. Neither were completely comfortable with their \"enlightened\" gunner's newfound bloodlust.\n\n\"Jesus Christ, that guy's crazy.\" Steve said. \"He's going to melt the goddamn barrel at this rate.\"\n\nJesus kept his eyes forward, pretending not to hear his human compatriot over the Buddha's enthusiastic use of the .50 cal. He was slightly annoyed at having his name taken in vain, but it was their fuel situation that truly had him worried. He might be able to turn water into diesel, but there was no more water to spare. He made a hard turn, leaving the scorched dirt for the ruins of an interstate highway. Steve held his breath as the engine sputtered, then began running smoothly again.\n\n\"We're not gonna make it to St. Louis.\" Steve said. \"Lucy, you got any tricks up your sleeve?\"\n\nSatan sat calmly in the rear cab, eyes closed, unfazed by the banter and gunfire. Her concentration was elsewhere. She felt two more of their pursuers' souls pass into Hell, but that, too, was a distraction. There were many more souls in the trucks behind them, and at least one divine being in the air above. This situation might demand that she reveal skills she would have preferred to keep hidden, but there was no alternative. Satan spoke for the first time in the firefight. \n\n\"Floor it till we run out of gas. Put as much distance between us and those trucks as you can. They've got eyes above.\"\n\nJesus smiled. \"I think we've got some things in the back for that.\"\n\nThe truck sped down the deserted highway, running on fumes and desperation. Steve looked at the heavier weapons arrayed in the truck bed, half-buried under a pile of the Buddha's spent brass. A few rocket propelled grenades, and an old anti-aircraft missile. He wasn't looking forward to using those things. Back in Atlanta, Jesus had helped Dionysus restock on wine in exchange for several of the weapons, but they'd not had cause to use them. Yet.\n\nThe engine sputtered a final time, then died. In the irradiated wasteland behind them, shrouded by ash and concealed in darkness, Quetzalcoatl circled. \n\n----\n\nIt had been days since Quetzalcoatl had gorged himself on the still-beating heart of a mortal being, and now his prey was cornered. He screeched with elation and dove from the sky toward his quarry. Months ago, he would have been content to have his followers bring him the offering. But in his hunger, Quetzalcoatl had grown impatient.\n\nHe saw the stranded truck and imagined the beating of the mortal's heart on his tongue. All of the creatures below could no doubt see him by now, but creatures of the earth were of no concern to a winged serpent. The conjured flames burned impossibly bright and moved as if of their own volition, but they paid the feathered god no heed, instead seeming content keep his mortal followers at bay. \n\n*Foolish creatures.*\n\nBlinded by his own hunger and Satan's flames, Quetzalcoatl did not notice the the anti-aircraft missile streaking toward him until it was too late. Not until he was knocked from the sky with a force he had never experienced before. Screaming in rage, he clawed at the air and flapped his broken wings as the ground drew ever closer. The fallen god had no time to register the impact before Satan's flames consumed him.",

            "comment": "The humvee rocked relentlessly as it tore through the rough terrain, almost throwing God out of the driver's seat. His vice-like grip on the steering wheel was the only thing keeping him in the vehicle. He yanked it back and forth in desperate attempts to avoid the incoming ordinance, eyes twitching to the rear view mirror for guidance. *Goddamnit,* he thought, catching glimpses of the rising dust cloud behind him, *the humans are closing faster than I expected.*\n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" shouted Jesus Christ, \"do you see that?\"\n\n\"It's about time they took us seriously,\" laughed Satan.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked God through gritted teeth, swerving to avoid another explosion.\n\n\"A gunship, father,\" said Jesus, his voice sinking, \"a very, very large one.\"\n\nGod glanced into the mirror once more. An enormous flying fortress now dominated the sky behind them, gaining fast. Its metallic skin glinted in the dying sun, revealing an arsenal of weapons more fearsome than any he'd seen before. Evasive manoeuvres would be useless against a monster like that. He would have to do something drastic.\n\n\"Jesus, take the wheel,\" he said, turning to face his son.\n\n\"Father, no, your powers are nearly\u2014\"\n\nHe put his hand on Jesus' shoulder to calm him, smiling softly, then looked to the back of the jeep. \"Satan, get behind me.\" \n\n\"Heh, you got it boss,\" he grunted, hauling an assault rifle in both hands.\n\n\"Buddha... man the fifty cal.\" \n\nThe bulging man only smiled in response. Then, with calm resolve, he shifted his weight behind the turret, grasped the trigger, and took aim at the encroaching hordes. A moment later, the sound of jolly laughter and blazing gunfire filled the air.\n\n\"Please don't do this, father,\" said Jesus, squeezing past God into the driver's seat, \"we won't be able to survive without you.\"\n\n\"I know you are afraid, my son, but technically speaking... well, you *are* me.\"\n\nJesus' shoulders sagged. \"I could never be as great as you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. The mistakes I have made are countless, and creating these monsters is only one of them.\" He gestured out to the approaching armada. \"I don't want you to be as great as me. I want you to be *better*.\"\n\nAnd with that he leapt into the air, Satan at his side. The ground shrunk below him, revealing the extent of the human army. There were thousands of them, swarming like ants, devouring the land in their vicious pursuit. A pang of guilt struck him as he watched. Everything was his fault. He wasn't omniscient, he couldn't have known that it would end this way, but he should never have given them so much power. They were his greatest mistake... and he would pay for it with his life.\n\n\"You sure you wanna do this, boss?\" Satan was hovering beside him, brown fur whipping wildly in the wind, rifles slung against his shoulders.\n\n\"We've had our turn, old friend.\" He smiled, familiar energy swelling up inside him. \"It's time to pass on the mantle.\"\n\nSatan grinned in return, madness flashing in his eyes. Then they turned their attention on the writhing mass of damned souls below them. \n\nDeities were not immortal, nor omnipotent. It had taken a long time for the humans to figure that out. Their technology and numbers were overwhelming now, and God wasn't sure if his kin would be able to survive the onslaught. But he did know one thing. He would give his son as much time as possible to gather his forces and fight. The humans would never forget this day.\n\nThe day that heaven and hell rained their wrath upon them.",

            "comment": "\"Wouldn't it'd be more fitting if Satan mounted the gun?\" Buddha asked, in that same level of near disturbing calm that I had grown accustomed to as Jesus hopped Dukes of Hazzard style into the front seat of the Jeep we had set for our escape. Satan, already upset with having to carry an unconscious Amaterasu in his arms, hurried ahead to place the former captive in the back seat.\n\n\"Yeah. Please. I'd rather shoot something then be stuck in the backseat with a filthy Pagen.\" Jesus turned back to give his brother an incredulous look.\n\n\"Lucifer. Language. Also, I would feel more inclined to agree with you and Buddha if he wasn't such a good shot.\" As Buddha and I took our places, Satan rolled his eyes and pointed to the mounted gun.\n\n\"Like you really need to be a good shot with the monster we've got on this baby.\" I was getting ready to tell the others to stop their bickering, but the sounds of gunfire did the job for me. Well, only long enough for Jesus to focus on driving us away from the internment camp. Buddha's eyes stayed on the facility as the growing distance caused it to shrink in our perspective. We couldn't relax. These people wouldn't stop until all gods and their followers (or sympathizers in my case) were wiped from this earth. \"Seriously,\" Satan continued. \"Why all this trouble for a fucking Pagen?\"\n\n\"Lucifer, if you use the 'P' word one more time, I'll-\"\n\n\"You'll what? Tell Dad? You know as well as I do that He never gave a shit about them untill people went all 'Clash of the Titans' on us!\"\n\n\"Friends?\" Buddha attempted to interject, but the calm of his voice left him ignored.\n\n\"How dare you accuse Father of not caring?!\" Jesus' voice began to escalate as he glared down his brother. Sometimes I think he doesn't spend enough time with Buddha. Also, you may think it unwise to look back while driving forward, but c'mon. It's Jesus.\n\n\"Companions?\" Buddha's second attempt.\n\n\"Hmm, lemme think? Oh, I dunno. Maybe COMMANDMENT 1?!\"\n\n\"Is this your envy talking?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" Clear sarcasm \"I'm envious that Pops gave me a real job with actual importance while all you did was dick around for 30-somethin' years and die!\"\n\n\"My job was very important!\"\n\n\"Right. Getting people hammered and cursing fig tress sounds muy importante.\"\n\n\"Comrades?\" Strike three for Buddha.\n\n\"Father sent me to teach love! To spread peace!\"\n\n\"Yeah, and to tell people that growing onions and tomatoes in the same field is a fucking crime!\"\n\n\"Oh yeah?! And what do you do, huh?!\"\n\n\"Punish murderers and rapists for all eternity! A job, mind you, that I take very seriously unlike some people!\"\n\n\"Oi!\" I shouted at the bickering deities. \"Tweedle-Dick and Tweedle-Balls! Buddha's trying to fucking say something!\" Jesus and Satan stopped their arguing to look to my with raised eyebrows. My gaze went to Buddha, still peering out into the distance. \"I'm sorry, Buddha, you were saying?\"\n\n\"Company.\" In that moment, the brothers and I looked back to see what Buddha had been seeing for God knows how long. Several Jeeps, completely identical to ours, following behind us and slowly advancing. There had to be at least 10 of them.\n\n\"Jesus Christ...\" said by the man himself, oddly enough. Looking back on it, hearing that said literally by Jesus would normally have been either head turing or a good laugh. All it was at that time, however, was my exact thoughts.\n\n\"Jesus! Eyes on the road, and punch it. Satan, protect Amaterasu. Buddha. Give 'em hell.\" Each of them took to their orders with clear focus. Satan, with the least action to take, looked down at the goddess of the rising sun and sighed.\n\n\"I really hope rescuing you was worth it.\"\n\n(Was all I could write during my break. Will add more later)\n\nEdit: Welp, there you have it. Any feedback would be awesome.\n",

US customs were on their ass hard core. \n\n Getting to the Ghost Canyon in Mexico was the only way. they weren't going to be dead men or worse. \n\n\"Jesus, Take the wheel.\" Loyal chambered a round on his M16 . \"Satan , behind me. \n\nJesus Vega  glowered at him though if you'd asked him, he's have said the name fit. Lucian was a scary blanco even by cartel standards \n\n\"Budda, get the 50 cal.\" \n\nEnrico Vega was as always placid which given his rather unpleasant military background was kind of surprise. The heavy bolt on Ma Duece made a heavy clatter. \n\n\"Looks like two pair and a duece\"  Lucian grinned\n\n\"We'll be a dead mans hand if we fuck this up\" Buddha said . The men looked at him in surprise but nodded, the serious potential for Los Personas No Mas was on everyone's mind. \n\nThe two and half ton truck  was elderly though the engine and suspension upgrades were a lot more high speed low drag than you'd expect from this kind of vehicle, the mounted 50 cal also came in handy\n\nAs the truck roared to life they could see the Federales were closing in ,four  big GMC trucks and a helicopter.\n\nThe big 50 boomed, 10 rounds in a second , smashed through thin skinned vehicles like tissue paper . The first careened off the road and the second swerved \n\nLoyal and his crew  had a narrow window in which to escape, not much time before DHS sent in something with a lot more firepower or just blew them to hell \n\nThe 50 boomed again and it was followed by a much quieter round from an M203 mounted under Loyal M16. The helo veered off, the pilot must have sensed something or was just avoiding the .50 cal \n\nThe chase was still on though and while the Mexican border with its paid off guards was only a few miles away , it felt like an endless run \n\nMore trucks joined in , probably a dozen now kicking up an epic duct storm as the careened across the desert behind them.

He was worried, the gas tank was leaking like a sieve , probably caught round from the DHS guys \n\n\"Hang on!\" Jesus made a tight S turn, a fantastic move for a two and half ton truck doing sixty and slid into a blind spot. They were far enough over the border that DHS wouldn't follow them \n\n\"That's why they  always say Jesus take the wheel \" Satan cracked \n\n\"Fuck you, Cabron' but Jesus was grinning from the adrenaline rush and just for being alive\n\nBuddha climbed off the vehicle \"Well, could have been better but  got the money. Looks like we won't cash in our chips today.\" \n\nLoyal heaved a sigh , thanks God or somebody Santa Muerte who knows for another day with  a good crew. He got out his cell phone, time to call for a ride, Since the money was all there, and a a little more, El Jefe wouldn't be too pissed and they'd get paid. \n\nTime for tequila , senrioitas and some well earned rest.

            "comment": "Five words. Five words that would change the world.\n\nThe Old Gods had returned. \n\nAt first the world did not notice that anything had changed. They assumed that global warming was a result of man-made carbon emissions and pollution. They thought that the increase in violence and strife was a result of burgeoning religious fundamentalism or a desire for democratic rule. The effects were subtle, and humans among all the other animals in the world are the most egotistical and narcissistic. Of course they were causing these problems.  \n\nThey were wrong. \n \nOf course, it took something more than just people killing each other over religion or the Great Barrier Reef dying to realize this. On November 12, 2017 a being suddenly appeared over Baghdad, Iraq. It was a nebulous dark mass of smoke, tentacles and fire. It's red eyes stared over the ancient city from over a mile above the ground. The world panicked. \n\nHumans by their very nature are good at ignoring things that are unpleasant. Death and existential dread first and foremost above them. They could ignore these no longer for they had become manifest. We're not sure if it was the scientists or journalists that first named this creature, but it came to be known as Thanatos. \n\nThe god of Death. \n\nThe creature did not move for 24 hours, the fires of its eyes never dimming nor closing. After one day to the very second, Thanatos opened its mouth and screamed. The very earth cried out in pain and a massive earthquake struck, destroying homes and killing hundreds. \n\nBefore the ground could calm and the sound die down, a dark smoke began to issue from Thanatos' mouth. As the black mist wafted down it began to compact and spin away from the larger mass of smoke. These pieces hit the ground like midnight meteors, throwing up dirt and dust. Many people were outside trying to avoid collapsing buildings so they noticed fairly quickly the *things* crawling from the various craters within the city. It took days to get a picture of these children of Thanatos. \n\nThey had killed everyone. \n***\n\n2nd Part - https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7d6cjy/wp_jesus_take_the_wheel_satan_get_behind_me/dpvi5cl/\n\n3rd Part - https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7d6cjy/wp_jesus_take_the_wheel_satan_get_behind_me/dpvn2pt/",

                    "comment": "*** FOB Iron Horse - Iraq - 200 miles SW of Baghdad ***\n\nJohn McIntosh - Tosh to his friends - sat on the top of his armored Humvee waiting for the world to end. His company commander had briefed all the men an hour ago and let them know that Baghdad had been destroyed. That the thing that had destroyed the city appeared to be invulnerable to conventional and nuclear weapons. Tosh really wished he could have seen it swat those ICBMs out of the sky. \n\nTosh thought it weird that he felt so calm about everything. He had been in country for 7 months and had dealt with his share of fighting. He had done his duty and had some pending commendations for something or other; but he had always been scared and anxious when on patrol or mission. He had worried about his friends dying, about him dying and leaving his wife and their two daughters alone in the world. But now he felt a strange inner peace and he wasn't sure why. It took him four cigarettes to actually figure it out. \n\nGod is real. \n\nTosh had never been a very religious person because he could not in good conscience believe in something that could not be proven by actual evidence. He did not need religion to provide a moral code and foundation for living well. But now, now he knew that something more existed outside of the physical realm of earth and human existence. There *is* something more. And that made him happy. It made him happy that he knew he would see Bec, Amy and Tess again. \n\nTosh had always wanted to believe in God. He was jealous of other people's faith because \n\n\"You know, I never really got used to all the worship.\", a voice said right next to Tosh. \n\nTosh jumped and tried to pull his side-arm out of its holster at the same time. Instead he fell off the Humvee and landed on his back in the Iraqi dust. The fall knocked the breath out of him and he laid there stunned for several long moments. As he laid there a face appeared over him. It was a kindly face and the man was of Middle Eastern descent with a dark brown tan and a well-kept beard. His dark hair reached his shoulder blades and his eyes were the kindest eyes Tosh had ever seen. \n\nThe man grabbed Tosh under his arms and picked him up and setting him on his feet. Tosh, at 5'11\", towered over this man and it wouldn't be until much later that Tosh remembered the man had no problem picking him up from the ground. \n\nThe man brushed off the dust from Tosh's shoulders and spoke in a perfect American accent, \"I'm so sorry about that Tosh, I should have given you some warning.\" The man looked Tosh in the eyes and Tosh was again taken by their depths. They were colorless yet every color and they radiated ... something, something that he could not truly comprehend. \n\n\"You see, I did not ask for any of this. I don't think any of us did really. And I can't begin to explain how difficult it has been for me to stay away and let terrible things happen to the people and world I love. I humbly seek your forgiveness, Tosh, and those of everyone else who believes in me and those who did not. But most importantly, I want to apologize to those who did not believe in me or my father, but still acted as I would. You are one of those, Tosh. Thank you.\" \n\nTosh sat their in a shocked silence. This man did not look like the priests said he looked. He was not white, or tall, or muscled. But he was kind. And holy. \n\n\"Tosh, I need a favor of you. It might get you in a little trouble, but I need to borrow this vehicle of yours. I am under some ... constraints ... and time is of the essence. Please tell Major Branson that it was for a good cause and that his son got into West Point. He'll understand the importance of that once you explain everything to him.\" \n\n\"Sure.\", was all that Tosh could say. Jesus gave Tosh's arm a fatherly squeeze and appeared behind the wheel of the Humvee. The engine started and before it could drive away Jesus turned to Tosh and said, \"Please don't worry. We're here now. You're not alone any longer.\" \n\nAnd Tosh realized something else that moment. Jesus was strong. So very, very strong. ",

He had spent the majority of his day working on a particular politician with a penchant for transvestites. He was a member of the Freedom Caucus and was currently having the time of his life in D.C. area hotel. And Kendall had secured his vote on a piece of legislation that would directly benefit one of his largest clients. \n\nToday was a good day, if you didn\u2019t consider the utter destruction of Baghdad and the millions of people dead. \n\nKendall didn\u2019t. \n\nAs he walked into his large corner office, he was surprised to find a man sitting in his expensive Italian leather chair. The man was tall, extremely handsome, and was wearing a particularly expensive suit. Did he have two horns coming out of his luxurious dark hair? No, Kendall thought, that\u2019s just my imagination. \n\nBefore Kendall could say anything, the man began to sing in a melodious baritone:\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cHe was driving fast on his way to Baghdad on a dusty November eve\n&gt; \n&gt; Going home to see where humanity was born and died in the desert heat\n&gt; \n&gt; 100 miles to go, he had no need for faith or gasoline\n&gt; \n&gt; It\u2019d been a long two millennia\n&gt; \n&gt; He has a lot on his mind, and is not paying attention\n&gt; \n&gt; He knows he is going way too fast\n&gt; \n&gt; Before he knows it, he\u2019s gonna go spinning on his thin brown ass\n&gt; \n&gt; He sees all their lives, flashing before his eyes\n&gt; \n&gt; He doesn\u2019t even have time to cry\n&gt; \n&gt; He\u2019s so very scared\n&gt; \n&gt; He knows not who else cares\n&gt; \n&gt; Jesus, take the wheel!\n&gt; \n&gt; Take it from my hands\n&gt; \n&gt; Cause he can\u2019t do this on his own\n&gt; \n&gt; I\u2019m letting go\n&gt; \n&gt; I\u2019m going to give him one more chance\n&gt; \n&gt; And save him from this road he\u2019s on\n&gt; \n&gt; Jesus, take the wheel!\n\nThe song stops and Kendall starts from immobility. Was that a country song? It sounded like a song that Kendall\u2019s daughter liked but the words were different. \n\n\u201cWho are you?!\u201d, demanded Kendall. \u201cAnd what the fuck are you doing in my fucking office?\u201d \n\n\u201cKendall, Kendall, Kendall.\u201d the man chortled. \u201cWho am I? You know who I am. You\u2019ve served me and mine so well over the years. I would think I should be recognizable to one of my truest disciples.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who the fuck you are, but you\u2019re getting out of my chair and out of my office or you are getting arrested.\u201d \n\nThe man laughed and all the picture frames in the office shattered. Kendall tried to head toward the door of his office but found he could not move. Even his eyes were frozen, focused on the face of this dangerous man sitting in his chair. \n\n\n\u201cI have something that you need to do for me Kendall. It\u2019s not for me really, but there are certain requirements to my *position*. Sometimes old duties and obligations come calling and what is a girl to do but answer them. You are going to leverage your contacts and political favors and convince the government to pull all resources from Iraq. The humanitarian efforts should end as every person within 100 miles of Baghdad is dead. There are no humans left there. You will get the US government to pull out and institute a no fly zone over the country. This is non-negotiable Kendall.\u201d\n\nThe man gestured around the office. \u201cYou either get this done or all of *this*, goes away. You may speak.\u201d\n\nKendall\u2019s mouth was released from whatever was holding it and he was able to talk. \u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m Satan, Kendall; your best friend, your paramour and your ever supportive benefactor. You\u2019ve served me well and now I\u2019m calling for a favor. A favor that requires you to work very diligently toward it or it will result in your downfall, utterly and completely. I will take your job, your family and anything that you have ever loved.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd destroy it.\u201d With these words twin blazes of fury flashed in Satan\u2019s eyes. Kendall could feel the heat hit his face and it chilled him to the bone. His bladder betrayed him and emptied itself, ruining is $5000 suit pants. All he could do was nod his head in affirmation. \n\nWith that one movement his body was released from whatever had held it. Satan stood up from the chair stretching like a cat. He walked over to Kendall and gave him a kiss full on the mouth. \n\n\u201cThanks darling. See you soon.\u201d \n",

            "comment": "Rodrigo Duterte took another hit of cocaine as he stomped on the pedal. Swerving in and out of traffic, Buddha lit up anything and anyone that got in their path.\n\nRodrigo was happy, for once. The drug dealers dying in their hovels, their wares in his possession. *I'm the king now*, he told himself. *They will all bow down to me.* He took another hit of the blow and reached for a few bags of junk Jesus grabbed on the way out. Jesus was smart like that, always had his eyes out for the good stuff.\n\nSatan thought the whole plan was foolish from the get go. \"Rob the drug dealers? Kill them all? I thought you were just fucking around with that shit, using it to trick the fuckwads who 'voted' for you?\" Nope, not Rodrigo. Rodrigo never fucks around. What he says, he does, and he said he was gonna kill the drug dealers.\n\nBuddha jumps back into the cab and flicks the radio on. He jacks the volume up all the way, Surgeon blares across the shops and buildings and scared little bugs scamper away from their aggressors. \n\n\"Fuckin' bitches,\" Buddha shouted. \"Come out and fight like real men!\" \n\nRodrigo laughed, he had to, it was all coming together too perfectly. He grabbed his dagger and dumped the dope onto it, shooting it down in one sniff. Satan reached for another bag and did the same. *He might be a pansy and complain about everything, but at least he knows how to party.* Rodrigo appreciated that. When you're President of the Philippines, all you do is party.\n\nAnd then as suddenly as it all began, it stopped. Buddha flew through the windshield, launching 50 feet before skidding to a halt, guts strewn all over the road. Jesus screamed as shards of glass pierced his hands and feet, maiming him. A ring of Buddha's skin was draped around his head. Satan was shouting something from the back seat, but Rodrigo couldn't hear. Everything hurt, his head pounded inside itself like a drum full of thunder. He reached down next to him and found one of Buddha's hands. Rodrigo tossed it aside, still too dazed to contemplate what had happened, to understand that it had all fallen apart in an instant. He reached around some more and found it.\n\nRodrigo Duterte took another hit of cocaine as he stomped on the pedal. Only this time, nothing happened. Excepting that the cocaine woke him up and brought him back to speed. He soaked in the carnage around him. \n\n\"Jesus Christ!\" He saw what had been done to his friend, his comrade, a brother in arms in his fight against evil. *This was supposed to be a god.* He stared in shock as a man died before him, bleeding from a thousand wounds.\n\nRodrigo looked behind him, Satan was gone. *The bastard.* He didn't need him anyway. Rodrigo followed the trail of Buddha's remains to what was left of his mangled body. *I will miss him most of all, but I won't cry. I am the President of the Philippines, and the drugs are mine.* A single tear fell from his eye.\n\nYet before he could shed another, he saw what was standing beyond Buddha, hand outstretched. The force that had stopped their vehicle dead in its tracks. The only force capable of such an act.\n\n*Odin.* The All Father.\n\nBefore Rodrigo could realize it was over, it ended.",

            "comment": "Never thought I would ever say the following word's \"Jesus take the wheel, Satan get behind me, BUDdha... man the .50 cal\"\n\nI was tired of fighting 99 other players all by myself for the last few hours so decided to join a squad as a forth via matchmaking. As usually I didn't have to wait long before I was placed with a group, as I arrived on Spawn Island I take a look at who is on my team and see that this is going to be an interesting game.\n\nI have Jesus from Mexico, doesn't seam to speak English very well (although as long as he is good and works as a team I don't really care), Then we have Mr. Satan, Clearly a fan of all things Anime and DBZ (to be honest who is not a DBZ fan?), and finally we have BUDdha, Who as soon as I joined started talking and you could tell he was pretty drunk. Well at least they all have microphones and seam to be friendly.\n\nSo we are in the plane and about to drop, at this point you can tell what type of group you are in, if they choose something far but good loot, you know they are in for the end game win. If they choose high risk, high loot spot like school or military base, you know that are going for the high kill count action. So you are asking me what did they choose? What else, SCHOOL!!!.\n\nWe drop towards School, and of course there is 5 other squads dropping near us, which of course also lag's me hard. Well I drop on the Gym roof and get a pistol, Jesus and Mr. Satan land in the courtyard and head to the first floor. BUDdha in his drunk state lands on the pool roof, which has no loot and you get damage when you jump off.\n\nI immediately get into a fire fight with one player, luckily he has bad aim and runs out of ammo, so I take him down, however his teammates rush me and then I get knocked down, however both Jesus and Mr. Satan had found guns and went straight to the roof getting behind the squad, Jesus took out two and Mr. Satan taking down the last one before reviving me. After being revived I get to the 3rd floor and after finding a med-kit start healing before looting those floors. Jesus and Mr.Satan are also getting as much loot as possible and BUDDha is still sitting on the roof hiding for now.\n\nWe almost finish looting when we see Jesus go down, near the Gym, he is taking fire from the Pool and the hill. He is able to crawl to us for a revive but we are pretty pinned down. Not sure on what to do I then hear BUDdha yell out \"LEEEROOOYYY JEEENNKKKINNNSS\", he had jumped off the roof of the Pool, found a Tommy Gun and was blind siding the 3 players in the pool, knocking them all down, This distracted the one on the hill and Mr. Satan knocked him down with a single headshot from his Kar98. This took out the second squad. This leaves me with 1 Kill, Jesus and Mr.Satan with 2 Each and BUDdha with 3 Kills.\n\nWe look around but it appears the other squads had headed out to the apartments and neighboring towns, So we finished looting and start moving to the center of the circle near Gatka on foot. We get half way their before we get ambushed by two members of a squad hiding in the trees/bushes. All four of us take cover behind a few trees. Mr. Satan is able to knock one down right away, I finish both by throwing a grenade behind the tree they where at, as the living player died by the nade we knew they where all that was left of that group. We gather our thoughts and get ready to head out, until we see it, an airdrop, not more than 200 yards away. Looks like they where camping it out ready to pick off anyone going for it. We start running towards the drop,  as we get there it appears we are alone, I grab the Level 3 Helmet, Mr.Satan gets the 15x Scope, and BUDdha gets the M249 (he called it the .50cal, although it used smaller ammo, whatever makes him happy).\n\nWe get ready to move as the next circle is a far away. Right as we start moving all hell breaks loose. Gun fire from all directions, multiple squads. We are pinned down, multiple squads all going for the air drop. Luck would have it that the gun fire was not all aimed at us, however the blue circle was moving in, we could not sustain a heavy firefight and live through the blue. We look around, and we spot it, a UAZ sitting near the squad we killed earlier was. I through as many smokes as we could around us. We start running, and then I yell out \"Jesus take the wheel, Satan get behind me, BUDdha... man the .50 cal\".\n\nI hop in the front seat, Jesus gets in the driver's seat with BUDdha behind him, and Mr. Satan behind me. Jesus takes off engaging boost, swinging side to side to avoid headshots. A few bullets find us but we all escape with half health. However right behind us there is a car loaded with a full squad, I call out to BUDdha to take them out, He unloads onto the car and a few seconds later it explodes, four more kills for BUDdha. \n\nWe get to the outskirts of Gatka, The circle is now small enough that its best to go on foot, Jesus does a perfect drift stop to let us out. We heal up with the last of our items. There is only 20 people left, aka 5 squads. Currently we are right on the edge, with most of the circle south of us towards the two canals/ditches. So we know to expect a squad or two in the ditch and some in the houses south of that. We start walking in, keeping near the bushes, slowing moving, checking the windows of the houses and any spot someone might be camping. \n\nWe got all the way to the north edge of the ditch without issue, however that did not last long. Mr. Satan yells squad to our south west by the houses, and right before we can react he goes down to a head-shot with the AWM, we try to take cover in the ditch but a second shot killed Mr. Satan before he could crawl to safety. This is not good, the AWM player seemed to be on point with his shots and we still had to worry about other players. so we decide to hold corners and just wait, Sooner or later one group will have to move, if we are lucky the other squad will and get taken out or reduced in numbers. \n\nWe are still in the circle, just in the ditch, we as sitting and waiting. The moment we take a shot everyone else will also know were we are. We just sit and wait and hope that everyone else kills each other so we can taste that chicken dinner. I look, so far 13 people left, several died outside the circle. So at least their is 2 full squads and 2 partials. We continue to wait, now the next circle is shown, it is in the west ditch, and we will have to move.\n\nWe start making are way down, we are currently in the north side of the east ditch. so we make our way south through the ditch. Halfway through we spot four players, hiding behind some pallets. we approach slowly, set our weapons for full auto, and pounce, this time with me leading with the LEERROOYY JEENNKIINNSS charge. I knock one out but then get knocked out by two others. Both Jesus and BUDdha get one of them knocked out, One is still left. While Jesus saves me, BUDdha watches guard and sees the last guy, he is hiding behind the far south ramp, BUDdha takes a few pot shots while I heal with the last med kit, And then with a few seconds to go before the blue moves in, Jesus headshots him with his SKS and the squad goes down.  \n\nDuring this shootout it appears the other two squads had theirs, as we are down to 6 players, and as the circle is so small we can old guess that its just 3 people in one squad in the western ditch. At this point they will have the slight advantage as we have to come to them. We come up with a quick plan, We will through all of our grenades at them and then rush them. So at a three count we through our last grenades over to the other ditch and then rant towards it. One person goes down, but two remain. Suddenly a nade falls at my feet, I go down, and there is no time to revive me. Jesus and BUDdha rush the ditch. \n\nAs I bleed out I see the kill feed, Jesus goes down next, leaving just BUDdha. I pray to the game gods that this fat drunk PUBG legend will bring us home our delicious chicken dinner. All I am hearing is lots of gun fire, then I see one of the other players go down. It is now 1V1, BUDdha vs the last player. At this time I am finally dead so I get to spectated, BUDdha is out of ammo on the m429 and only has a few rounds in his Tommy Gun, both players are on opposite sides of a set of pallets. The other player finally rushes BUDdha, who empties his clip into him, it does not kill however causes the other player to retreat, In a last ditch effort BUDdha pulls out his pan and rushes after the other player. This must have awestruck the other player as he just stood there, not moving. Thunkkkkk, Screen pops up \"Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner!\". He did it, BUDdha has won. I shout joy into the microphone. Before the game disconnects I hear BUDdha say \"Jesus may save, Satan my take your soul, But BUDdha kicks A$*\". Then as quickly as it had started the game was over. Sadly I never got their steam contacts and was unable to find them to add them to my friends list.\n\nIf you are out there my PUBG buddies, Jesus, Mr. Satan, BUDdha. I will always love to be your fourth man in squads.\n\nSigned,\n\nA-Noob-Bus\n\n",

            "comment": "\"Jesus take the wheel, Satan get behind me, Buddha... man the .50 cal\" \n\nWe had failed. The beast had acquired the last of the gems and had begun its transformation. We watched over our shoulders in a sprint,  as its unnaturally-orange, wrinkled skin rippled and expanded, tearing through its ill-fitting suit and smashing the podium before it to nothing more than kindling. It's dull, lifeless eyes darkened, dribbling fiery tears of joy as it cackled, and a headdress of horns arouse from its skull, piercing the beret of swooping hair it wore, like stalagmites from a barren, inhospitable cavern. It grew in size as our team neared the armored Humvee, the military personnel standing jaws agape, paralyzed in terrible awe. It's mass increased, smashing through the White House portico as we reached the vehicle.\n\nJesus jumped into the driver's seat as the original unit collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely through their eyes. He nodded, a wave of calm washing over me. Buddha climbed up the .50 cal and prepped it, robes billowing in the hot air emanating by the bloating titan, serenity despite the carnage and screams from the immolated press crew. Satan had my six, something that made the hairs on my neck stand on edge. Useful, no doubt, but no one was ever quite sure where he stood. And I...I jumped in next to Jesus. \n\nWe had been summoned to return, uniting, reconciling in the face of a universal threat and over the past six months had formed an alliance of begrudging respect and, perhaps, friendship. Our missions took us around the globe, against awful odds, where everything always hung on a knife's edge. But when miracle workers are concerned, a knife's edge is as broad as the Arabian desert. \n\nAnd yet, we were losing. The Beast now towered over the surrounding city, stomping through the remains of the White House, bellowing \"MAGA MAGA MAGA\" incomprehensibly, in a rage that its hands were now too big to access Twitter. \n\nJesus drove us toward the Beast, screaming \"Not in my name!\" while Buddha opened fire, bullets thudding into the Beast's clementine hide. \"Four things cannot be long hidden,\" his voice cut through the din, \"the sun, the moon, truth...and my vengeance.\"\n\nThe Beast shrieked, \"Unfair. Losers. Whattabout Hillary?\" It swung at the vehicle and missed by feet, its fist rending the earth, sending chunks of immaculately manicured grass into the windshield. Jesus spun the wheel and the Humvee turned around, Buddha's fire never ceasing. Satan stood next to him, manhood in his hands, peeing and laughing at the Beast, which only served to enrage it more. \n\nThe Beast stomped after us, the Humvee's engine straining as Jesus floored it, eyes on the rearview. We cut through the Ellipse and across Constitution, swerving around flaming wrecks that used to be cars. Buddha ran out of bullets. Satan ran out of urine. I gathered my strength. \n\nAs we reached the Washington Monument, it seemed like all hope was failing. The Beast was growing stronger, not weaker, gathering the souls of its followers from around it, its foot was now the size of our vehicle. Thankfully, the Beast stopped to compare its appendages to the erect monument but the reprieve was temporary. I was not ready yet. \n\nWe continued south, but we were rapidly running out of time...and land. \"Don't worry,\"Jesus said with a wink, \"I got this.\" Buddha's eyes widened as we reached the Tidal Basin. Satan rolled his eyes and muttered \"Not this again...\" Jesus never took his foot off the accelerator and we bombed straight onto the water, never sinking, skipping across the surface like a stone on a pond, until we reached the other side, screeching to a halt. \"We need to do something...all those people,\" Jesus said, tears in his eyes. \"We must look within,\"Buddha said, though truth be told, it wasn't very helpful. \"We must look to ourselves. Hit the gas for Chr....your sake,\"Satan said in predictable selfishness. \n\n\"No,\" I said, \"The time for running is at an end.\" The Beast stepped out in the Basin, dying the water a sickly tangerine color, fish bubbling to the surface. The Beast was salivating acid, interspersed with ravings about \"the best\" and \"greatest,\" smashing an in-bound Qatar airways flight with glee. \n\nAnd then, I was ready.  \n\nFrom the distance, it was only a small brown speck, growing larger by the second. In a moment, you could see the white top and then the timber line. I grinned. The Beast scratched its hairpiece in confusion. \n\n\"The mountain has come to Mohammed.\" I shouted and directed it with all of my will. The millions of ton of rock, ore, and soil loomed above the Beast, casting it back into shadow, and then fell, with a sickening, though satisfying smoosh, like the sound of a scorpion smashed under heel. \"Fake NEWS!\" The Beast bellowed and then expired. \n\n\n\n",

Satan was taken aback a bit on some of the choicest aramaic expressions, but He was a carpenter, and carpenters do not sign hymns when the hammer hits a body part instead of a nail. \nThe soul in the shotgun seat was still shouting commands, but the task was pretty obvious for the three gods - their first enemy, a cohort of roman warriors, with Mars at their lead was coming up. As Jesus deftly drifted around their testudo Satan opened up their rank with a couple of grenades and Buddha opened up with the Ma Deuce. The ranks fell, and the soul was free from temptation a while. But the problem with these modern souls was that they are tempted by much more than the good old Allah or the occasional Mammon. Their next target was looming on the horizon - a pig-headed man? With spikes on his head? \n\"WHAT THE FUCK\" cried Jesus, but by then Satan knew that this will be one of their longest days. This soul belonged to a student of comparative religion, and she fell asleep on her thesis half-finished chapter about Kamapua\u02bba.

I drive through the destroyed landscape that was once Heaven, barely managing to avoid the various holes in the clouds. Jesus, Satan and Buddha are all in the car with me - I stumbled upon them by chance, saved their lives, and now we're working to repair the afterlife.\n\n\"Jesus. See any Rogue Angels?\" I ask, turning towards Christ. He's looking through the holes in his hands, using them like some sort of telescope. Maybe they actually do function like that. I never asked. I don't like looking at them for too long.\n\n\"No sign of them, but I doubt they've decided to leave us alone now,\" he confirms, but he continues looking. He's been paranoid since I found him. Maybe something's up.\n\nSatan smokes a cigarette, blowing the smoke in my face. \"Ugh, how many times have I asked you to stop smoking?! Jesus Christ!\" I snap.\n\n\"What?\" Jesus asks, confused.\n\nI then cover my mouth with one hand immediately, continuing to steer with the other hand. This is the first time I've actually snapped at my companions - they all have their faults, but I've always been polite about it. Until now, that is.\n\n**\"What did you just say?\"** Satan asks, narrowing his fiery red eyes. I immediately regret what I just said.\n\n\". . . S-shit, sorry-\"\n\nThe Devil merely laughs. **\"I've been wondering how long it would take you to actually stick up for yourself!\"** I calm down a bit. He doesn't seem mad - then again, sometimes it's hard to tell with him. He pats me on the back - a bit forcefully, but then again, everything he does is forceful. He tosses the cigarette out of the semi truck with his other hand.\n\n\"Did you really have to throw it onto the clouds?\" Buddha argues. \"You could start a fire or something.\"\n\n**\"This place is already absolutely destroyed. Doesn't matter.\"**\n\n\"Yeah, but that could-\" I'm interrupted by the sounds of blades being drawn. Jesus quickly turns, seeing a large group of demons, armed with swords of varying sized.\n\nAfter a few seconds of silence, the son of God speaks. \"Draw in an ambush.\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ.\"\n\n\"What?\"",

We were up against the greatest evil there ever was, and evil so powerful that all the immortals band together to fight to win. Earth became a battle ground, few humans survived in hiding, those who weren\u2019t caught and put to work in the mines created a rebellion joining us to fight this great evil. Some humans call it \u201cthe darkness\u201d us immortals know it\u2019s true name one so vile we are forbidden to say it. (This is all I got rn I\u2019ll see if I can add to it later ....) ",

Many will stand in our path, though they will only be standing on the shoulders of others that they have convinced our intentions are impure. When we pass over all of them, as we rightly should, the true curvature and presence of this planet will reveal itself. We will see all lies told as the truth that hides behind them. We will see all impure people as the pure people they had the capacity, at one point, to be. Our hearts will continue to beat, and they will become louder. Not loud enough to capture the attention of those who are not listening, but quiet enough to reach the ears of those truly listening. Those who hear our pulse will be brought on board this shining ship. They will be fed the knowledge we have gained, and they will be delighted. It will taste the same as their first scoop of ice cream, it will be more refreshing than their first drink of water after a long hike through the forest. Together we will share the songs of our souls, we will uplift each other and become the only known image of the capacity of human minds and human hearts.",

Next time I\u2019m picking the codenames.\u201d\n\nBrandon shook his head, \u201cWhat I don\u2019t get is how whoever was assigning names decided I would\u2019ve the code name Buddha. Not only am I Roman Catholic, I\u2019m also the sharpshooter!\u201d\n\nSuddenly a stern voice cut in over the radio. \u201cFor the last time, keep the radio chatter to a minimum, we don\u2019t want to get caught.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 looked chastised, \u201cRoger that Mohammed.\u201d\n\nSilvia turned to look at Stanley and said, \u201cBut seriously, whose turn was it to pick the code names?\u201d\n\nStanley chuckled, \u201cIf I had to guess?

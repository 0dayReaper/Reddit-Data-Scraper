I pushed myself up from the concrete slab I had been dozing on with great effort. \n\n\u201cUh?\u201d I blinked, \u201cOh, it\u2019s you, doctor.\u201d \n\nDoctor Simmons stared at me impatiently through the plexiglass separating us. I paused for a moment as I peered at her, \u201cYou\u2019ve cut your hair since I last saw you, haven\u2019t you? It looks nice.\u201d \n\nShe rolled her eyes, \u201cThere\u2019s a villain attacking the asylum. We need your help.\u201d \n\nI rolled over, facing away, \u201cHm. I\u2019m not feeling it.\u201d \n\nI could feel her staring in the silence. It was uncomfortable so I sat up, frowning, \u201cCan\u2019t you find someone else?\u201d I asked helplessly, \u201cI\u2019m a patient, remember? Insane super here? Y\u2019know, kept in here for the safety of the public, etc etc?\u201d \n\nSimmons folded her arms, glaring, \u201cAre you coming or not? Look, I don\u2019t have the funding to call for any A-list heroes to deal with this! Get up and help, or\u2026\u201d \n\nI raised my brow, interested, \u201cOr?\u201d \n\nSimmons\u2019 eyes narrowed, \u201cI\u2019ll cancel your wifi access.\u201d \n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I started immediately, \u201cC\u2019mon, that\u2019s a low blow! I need my internet! I\u2019ll be so bored in here!\u201d \n\nSimmons sighed, rubbing her temple, \u201cOf all the supers in the world to win the power lottery\u2026why did it have to be you?\u201d  \n\nI shrugged, \u201cI ask myself that question all the time too, doctor.\u201d\n\nSimmons continued to glare, arms folded. She clearly wasn\u2019t going to go away, I decided. It would probably be less troublesome to just do what she wanted. After all, it was only by Doctor Simmons\u2019 kindness that I could continue staying in here rather than being out on the streets getting randomly approached by various crazies in tights and spandex. \n\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll help you out,\u201d I sighed.\n\nDoctor Simmons nodded, all business at once, although I saw a hint of a smile on her face as she turned away, \u201cWe\u2019ll turn off the cameras down the corridors in five minutes\u2019 time. Remember, I didn\u2019t see you escape from your cell.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m familiar with this routine, doctor,\u201d I said dryly to her, \u201c\u2026can I get a thank you at least?\u201d \n\nSimmons walked off, but I heard her mutter faintly under her breath, just at the edge of my enhanced senses.\n\n\u201c\u2026thank you.\u201d",

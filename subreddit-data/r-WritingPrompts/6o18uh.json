            "comment": "\"It's not the money, it's the principle.\"\n\nMy father's words. Though I think he was talking about taking a loan, as in principal with an A L, but that doesn't really matter.\n\nIt was free to find out who the culprit was, the bank does that for you. Not to help you, but to know who to put on their hit lists, your gain is just an added benefit. But for a petty crime like stealing 10 dollars, the bank does nothing. Apparently their policy only applies to thefts of more than fifty dollars. \n\nSo I had to take matters into my own hands. \n\nThe bank was kind enough to tell me who the culprit was, though: James Graham. Asshole extraordinaire. The bastard had stolen my lunch every time he was in lunch back in elementary school, which admittedly was not very often considering he had detention almost everyday.  But still, having my apple juice carton ripped mercilessly out of my hands and disemboweled by another man is an image that will haunt me forever. \n\nAnd now, he had the nerve to come back to my life, and steal *my* money. Hell no. No sir. And so I plotted my revenge. According to Stalkbook, Graham lived in London. Now, I did not have the cash for tomorrow's train fare, so a flight was out of the question, unless I wanted to withdraw from my savings account...which I actually wasn't legally allowed to for ten more years. \n\nSo I waited. \n\nI worked extra hours at the StellarDollars, even though my soul withered a little more every moment I stood and smiled at random people who had come to get coffee or milk or whatever the hell. I sacrificed some of my guaranteed interest on the savings account and moved it to an investment variant, where I could chose to invest the money into different stocks or companies. \n\nAnd I did. I had a plan you see, a plan so grand it would destroy him so utterly, so completely that he would lie broken at my feet, begging for mercy, and I, in my infinite kindness, would deny it. I read online articles, made the correct movements, predicted changes, made gambles. I cried, laughed, and died inside. And through it all only one name filled my mind, one name that fueled my drive, my relentless quest: James Graham: Asshole Extraordinaire.     \n\nOne day, of no particular import, the call that I knew would come, came. \n\nI stood up in the middle of the conference meeting, and dozens of chairs swiveled around and men in suits stared at me. \n\n\"Sir?\" One asked, \"we have to discuss this quarter's profits...\"\n\nI glared at him, and he fell silent. Without another word I stalked out of the meeting room, men and women staring at me as I did, but I paid then no mind. I pulled out my phone and answered. \n\n\"Sir, a loan verification from the name of James Graham has come in, asking for 2 hundred thousand,\" Stephanie said. I'd told her years ago to tell me when this happened. I'd bought out all the other banks in the area. He would have no choice to to borrow from mine, it was just a question of waiting. \n\nAnd the wait was over.  \n\nI grinned. \"Stephanie, approve him, but internally make it a loan of two million,\" I paused, and continued, \"and ten - discreetly of course.\"\n\nStephanie had known me for years, she didn't ask any questions. \n\nSo when Graham got his first payment due he was suitably surprised to find his loan payments about ten times what they had been. He went to the bank enraged, sure there had been an error. \n\nThere was no error. The system clearly said he had borrowed 2 million, and now it was time to pay. \n\nOh and pay he did. \n\nHe could only watch as his house was sold, his wife divorced him, his kids hated him, his friends deserted him. I found him on the streets one day, begging with some coins in a cardboard box in front of him. I knelt down, patted him on the back and gave him a ten. \n\nJames' eyes widened, and he looked up at me, almost crying. \"Th-thank you sir, thank you so, so much!\"\n\nI just smiled at him and walked away, whistling a merry tune. \n\n***\n\nIf you enjoyed, check out [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) for more of my work ",

James' child Mathew (Matty) had a coin eating problem, which was probably a result of a nutrient deficiency caused by a low-cost diet. Nickels were his favorite since they were so silvery sweet! It was the day after James had paid all his bills for the month; pay-day was tomorrow. It was really tough for James to support a family AND pay for the therapy sessions to deal with his aggression issues that stemmed from his abusive parents. He planned to pay back that $10 (and a few gallons of grape juice!) since he felt bad about his misplaced aggression in grade school. He may have bullied MC, but it was the only way he knew how to interact with people given that his parents treated him so badly. What he was ashamed to admit was that MC was the closest thing to a best friend he ever had. But James didn't have enough for the $10 co-pay and the nickel in Matty's throat was threatening to turn. Matty was red going on purple and it was MC's $10 that would save his life. MC had always been kind to James, allowing him to take his lunch (which would be his only way of surviving the night without gut-wrenching pangs of hunger due to the neglect of his alcoholic mother). Hopefully, for little Marty's sake, MC would still be the same selfless person he had always been.",

            "comment": "*It's not about the money. It's about the principle of the thing!* \n\nI don't want you to get the wrong picture of me. I'm not some white-collar slob browsing through memes in an air-conditioned office. I'm an electrical engineer who put himself through school on nickels and dimes. I had to sell my radio to buy my uniform for my first day of work, although I would have sold a kidney if that hadn't covered it. If I'm willing to get my hands dirty to earn my money, you can sure as hell know I'm willing to get them dirty to get it back.  \n\nWhen someone takes money from me, it's not just me they're stealing from. They're stealing from my father who worked a night job to keep clothes on my back. They're stealing from my children who can't understand why their father doesn't love them enough to get them the same toy their friends have. They're stealing from every honest man, every American dream, every - \n\n\"Next in line please.\" \n\nThe vein in my forehead learned to tap-dance. If a glare could kill, the McDonalds Cashier in front of me would have flipped his last burger. \n\n\"I gave you a twenty. You gave me change for a 10.\" My voice could have chiseled rock. There was a collective sigh from the line behind me, but I held my ground. \"I'm not leaving until you give me my 10 back.\" \n\n\"I know how to do my job, *sir*. Next in line!\" \n\nIt would have been one thing if I was a strung-out fool scratching at my ass, but I was a professional man. From my tucked in dress shirt to my carefully parted hair, everything about me screamed credibility. The nerve of this greasy teenager to disregard me so quickly - \n\nBut this wasn't over. Oh no, this was far from over. He was nothing compared to me, and I was going to prove it. But I wasn't going to stoop to his level. I was going to use my game to beat him. \n\nI'll admit, my plan seemed a lot simpler in my head. These types of registers just spring open when the electricity shorts out. After that, all I had to do was grab it and run. It wasn't stealing: it was justice. But then I guess I started overthinking things... \n\nThe supplies I needed from Home Depot set me back a bit, but soon I'd put together a simple device which drew so much power in a feedback loop that the whole building would be overloaded. Sure I had to bribe the guy who worked there when he got suspicious what I was going to use it for, but you never know when I'll need to use this baby again. \n\nOf course, just to be safe I might as well get rid of the security cameras. No point going to all this trouble just to get caught. I can't believe it cost a couple hundred dollars just to get someone from the company to recall them for maintenance. Worth it, of course, because now I was ready to exact my revenge. \n\nOnly he'd already finished his shift by then, and I didn't want to get someone else in trouble. I followed him home instead, maybe a bit too fast, because I got a speeding ticket along the way. He wouldn't have a register at home, but I could still go in and take it by force. Of course, for that I'd be safer to bring along some protection, so I had to buy a gun. \n\nCouldn't wait the three days, so I just got a hot one from a buddy I know. Cost a little extra, but you know what you can't afford to replace? Dignity. Finally, it was midnight, and I had everything I needed. Time to make this bastard pay. \n\nOr it would have been, if I hadn't accidentally broken into the wrong house. There was a lot of screaming and confusion. Understandable, given me crashing in through their kitchen window, but who the hell really needs a stain glass window in their house anyway? Bunch of white-collar pussies if you ask me. Of course I offered to pay for the damages, so it's not like any real harm was done. \n\nBut now! The right house. Right time. Just before the break of dawn, I knocked on his door. Long, loud knocks. Not the sound of a thief in the night - more like the authoritative confidence of the police upholding the great law. \n\nNo reply. What would the police do in this circumstance? Exactly the same thing I did. Break the door in. Gun at the level, I flipped on every light I came across. I have nothing to hide. Do you? \n\n\"What's that awful racket?\" An older woman. Must be his mother. She waddled blearily down the hallway in her nightgown, freezing when she saw the gun in my hand. \"Oh sweet Jesus. Michael! Call the police!\" \n\n\"I am the police!\" I roared. \"Where is that son-of-a-bitch?\"\n\n\"You're no police. Where's your badge?\" \n\n\"Well, not exactly the police. But I'm on the side of justice -\" \n\n\"Michael get down here and help me!\" she screamed. \n\n\"Yeah, come here Michael,\" I added, albeit a bit less confidently than when I had begun. \"And bring my ten dollars!\" \n\nSoon they were both against the wall, quivering in fear. I was starting to get uneasy now, but any hesitation would make it look like I was confessing to doing the wrong thing. I wasn't! The money was mine! And God as my witness, I wasn't leaving without it. The moment when he handed me the folded bill, I knew it was all worthwhile. Sure I'd spent my whole savings to get this back, but I'd also deterred this scumbag from his future life of crime. \n\nI put the bill in my pocket and walked home in triumph, the exalted return of a victorious emperor from his conquered land.  \n\nI guess in retrospect I should have looked at the bill Michael gave me. Bitch only gave me a 5. \n\n---\n\n[More from author](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade). ",

            "comment": "I'll admit, it wasn't my proudest moment. I was working as at a bank, and a pretty strange guy came in to open an account. You probably know the type. Overly loud to cover his insecurities, laughs obnoxiously at his own jokes, weird clothes. Anyway, this guy comes in and has a sack full of cash to open an account. Plops it down on my desk and has me set it all up for him. \n\nWe finish up around lunch time and I send the guy on his way, then head back to the vault with the money. It's right around then my stomach starts growling at me and I remember I left my lunch at home. Things have been a little tight around the home front with a new baby, so I'm feeling strapped. You can probably guess where this is going. I went ahead and took $10 out of the sack, and processed the deposit. I figured a guy with this much cash wouldn't miss it. Who misses $10 out of a $86,400 deposit?\n\nJohn Oker, apparently. Not that I found this out immediately. No, it was two years later. \n\nI was doing auditing work for a different company by this time, and was supposed to go inspect a warehouse for an important client. The place looked abandoned when I got there. No lights were coming out of this massive, old building. The paint was peeling, and most of the windows were still boarded up. Those that weren't were covered in a thick layer of grime that made it impossible to see inside. The remains of the sign for the old chemical plant that used to operate out of here still clung to the top parts of the wall, but a small wooden sign near the main door confirmed I was in the right place: \"Laughing Planet Inc.\"\n\nInside was about a filthy as the outside. But there were definite signs of activity. Conveyor belts had been put in, and there were toys in various states of construction spread throughout. \n\n\"Hello?\" I called.\n\nMy voice echoed around the warehouse a bit. I started to turn to leave when an answer finally came.\n\n\"Jerry! So glad you could make it. Please, step on in.\" It was a man's voice. One I didn't recognize at first. \n\nI spun around and looked for the source of the voice, but didn't see anyone. \"Yes, I believe I had an appointment with Ms. Quinn? She was going to give me a tour of the facilities,\" I shouted back. \n\nThere was another pause. Again, I almost gave up on the whole thing, which in hindsight, I should have.\n\n\"She won't be joining us, as she had another engagement come up unexpectedly. So I'll be giving you the tour.\" The voice came from right behind me. I spun around and recognized him immediately. The man from the bank. Still wearing the same strange clothes, now topped off with wild dyed hair and a heavily made up face.\n\nBefore I could even get a word out, he took me by the arm and led me deeper into the building. \"As you can see, we had to let the janitor go,\" he said, before busting out his obnoxious laugh. He led me through a maze of of half built walls and empty crates until we came to a storage area.\n\n\"Here's where we keep the raw materials, Jerry. I expect you'll want to take an inventory.\"\n\nI leapt at the chance to start talking professionally. It took my mind off the strange circumstances I was in. \"Yes, that's correct. You know in small businesses like yours, it's actually shockingly common for employees to steal. One of the leading causes of those businesses going under is shrinkage, either at the till or in the inventory.\"\n\n\"Oh, shrinkage you say!\" Mr. Oker gave in to another fit of laughter. I didn't get the joke.\n\nI looked around the area and spied something sitting on the floor, so I stooped to pick it up. \"A ten dollar bill,\" I said.\n\n\"How careless!\" the man in the strange purple clothes said. \"Well Jerry, finders-keepers, am I right? You can apply it toward your bill, or just pocket it. I'm sure you've earned it.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" I said with a nervous laugh. \"That would be unethical. You'd better take it.\"\n\nMr. Oker stepped over to me and took the bill from my hand. \"Well I admire that Jerry, I really do. Ethics really is high on my list of must haves.\" He chuckled again, before continuing. \"In fact, I'd never let it go if someone stole from me. Not ever. If I found out someone had taken my money, why, I might buy a warehouse for a fake toy company, and lure the thief there, then strap him to the conveyor belts and run him through the machines.\"\n\nI tittered nervously. He didn't.\n\nHe stepped closer to me, pressing me against some of the crates. \"Do you remember me, Jerry?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry Mr. Oker, I...\"\n\n\"Please, call me Joker.\"\n\nAnd that's when he punched me. One good whack to the head and I was out. When I woke up, I was strapped to the conveyor belts. \n\n\"Rise and shine, Jerry!\" Joker shouted from a platform high above me. I watched as he dramatically heaved an enormous lever. The machinery sprang to life, and I started moving toward the metal contraption that would turn me into a child's plaything. \n\nI pulled against the ropes, but couldn't get free.\n\n\"Maybe your ethics will save you!\" Joker called.\n\n\"No, but mine will,\" a gravely voice answered. I heard the dull sound of a fist hitting someone. \n\n\"Oh Bats, here to ruin my fun again! Even though I'm in the right this time!\" Joker called. \n\nThere was no answer this time, just the sounds of a scuffle. All I know for sure is that the machine turned off a minute before I was going to become a puppet.\n\nSorry if this was a longer answer than you wanted, Commissioner Gordon, but to cut to the chase: yes, I have some idea of what the Joker wanted with me. \n\n*****\n\nIf you enjoyed this, you can subscribe to [Pubby's Creative Workshop](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pubby88) to read more of my prompt responses.",

            "comment": "I never expected to catch a flight to Paris on a Tuesday night, but life has a way of surprising you.\n\nWhen I noticed the odd balance in my checking account, I did the usual: called the bank, reported a fraudulent charge, got the card cancelled. The receptionist told me the charge had an international origin and was spent at a *boulangerie* in the Latin Quarter of Paris. Otherwise, no further information.\n\nI booked a flight minutes after hanging up. \n\nFrom there, it was a matter of following the paper trail. I got repeated surges of adrenaline wandering into cafes and gift shops, asking questions, collecting information. It had been eight years since I'd done this type of work, and it felt spectacular.\n\nYou don't fuck with a retired detective.\n\nThe guys covered their tracks pretty well but, as luck would have it, two of 'em wandered into the same cafe just a half hour apart. Bad move. I found out where the second guy lived, booked a hotel room right next door, and bought a pair of binoculars.\n\nReconnaissance took longer than anticipated. I also ordered too much room service and fancy French wine and cheese. Hey, if you're retired and in Paris, what else are you gonna do?\n\nThe next day, I decided to make my move. Slowly. My back hurts all the damn time these days.\n\nTurned out it was a dud. The guy had left earlier in the morning and I was too much of a lazy fuck to get up at the crack of dawn, so I decided to look for the other guy.\n\nGod, it took a while. I overestimated my own skills, to be honest. Maybe it was hubris, maybe it was fear of my own age. But with about two thousand bucks left in my account - don't even remember how many euros that is - I found him.\n\nI gave a firm knock on the door and he opened it right up. \n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nI punched him square in the jaw. Again, hubris. He threw me to the ground within seconds and whipped out a knife.\n\n\"Give me one good reason to not cut you to pieces, *connard*.\"\n\n\"You stole something from me. Ten dollars of hard earned cash. I want it back.\"\n\nHe lowered the knife and laughed. \"Ha! An American, I take it. You think you can come here and be like...who is it? Bruce Willis. Arnold Schwarzenegger. A real hero. Well, this is bigger than you'll ever understand, old man. So I suggest you run on back home and we'll forget this ever happened.\"\n\nGod. What was I thinking? I honestly believed that I could put a stop to it and get back what was mine. But when you're pushing eighty? Well...I guess I valued my life more than that, at least in that moment.\n\nHe let me go, but not without another threat. He told me there would be eyes on me now and for the rest of my life, even back in America.\n\nYeah, sure, pal. I've heard a hundred empty threats just like that.\n\nI booked a plane ticket back to San Diego with the last of my money and collapsed in my apartment.\n\nLater that week, I took a part-time job at a bakery. Easy stuff - after-hours cleaning and shelving. Calls itself a *boulangerie*, but it's pretty shit compared to France.\n\nI'm saving my money to fly back to Paris, because I'm not done with these bastards. \n\nOne day, I'll get that $10, even if it fucking kills me.",

If they could've taken 0.00 maybe they would've..\n\nI track all my outgoings at the end of every year so here I am in the departures lounge of Amsterdam airport staring at a cell in my spreadsheet. - 10?? Blank blank. \n\nThe date was September 9th 2017. 3.42a.m What the hell? \n\nWhat was I doing on that very day? I was in hospital, recovering from a broken ankle sustained from a freak cycling accident in the park. \n\nSo it's a scam, take ten bucks from a random account...no one will notice. Take it from thousands of accounts...well throw me a boomerang...how much did he make? Probably millions. Sonofa. Probably more than the 84k I've got anyway. \n\nSome random kid in a hoody drops off a thick envelope and moves off. I take a peek. Names and bank accounts...all minus 10. There's at least 400 sheets here. All the entries have the same date. But the times are different because the bank account holders are from all over the world. It cost me 8k to get this info. Money well spent. Adjusting for the time difference gives me a location.\n\nLondon. 76k left. \n\nPaying to follow the trail leads me to a pub just south of Waterloo bridge. Here another anonymous dude in a hoody deposits another envelope in my lap.       \nThere's just a single pink post it note inside. I study it over a bowl of scratchings and lukewarm beer. I have an address and a name. I call a cab. \n\nThe following morning the news reports will exaggerate the death of a man who died of apparent overeating in a seventeen day binge. But this time the reports are disappointingly bland. Later forensic analysis and post mortems reveal that one Terry Kaspociwz died of internal bleeding. It took a while to break the 76k down, repeated blending was required. It took even longer to reverse the transactions. However you can have your cake and eat it Terry. \n\nThe other victims had their 10 bucks returned. They'll never notice but I did. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Time is a precious thing. It's what governs our lives, controls us. My mother always used to say that there were two things certain in life; death, and taxes. There is one thing we can never escape, one rule of physics that can seemingly never be broken. We cannot escape the end.\n\nSome people spend their time helping others, making the world a better place. Some live day to day, trying to put food on the table for their family. Yet some feel the need to rob others, taking everything in bank accounts, homes, safes. Ever since the scientists had figured out how to tie the time we had left on this earth to a clock, people had been looking to exploit the system. Stealing time from others.\n\nThe way it worked was that you'd pay for things in time. Your bank account consisted of the same number of dollars as seconds on your clock, and when that reached zero, you'd wither away and die. I want to be able to say that I spent my time well, but in truth I did not. I wanted to spend more time with my family, spend every possible second with them until my demise. So when my bank account showed I had 24 hours left, I knew what I had to do.\n\nI was in the car on my way home when the bank called. \n\n\"Sir, I have to inform you someone has stolen $10 from you. Normally this would be inconsequential and I would not call - we would investigate and call only if we couldn't resolve it - but given the amount of money in your account, we thought this may impact your plans.\"\n\n*Fuck.*\n\nThere goes my plans for a grand celebration. I had to track this man down who stole my time.\n\n\"What do you know?\"\n\n\"Not much. We think the culprit is a male, late teens, but beyond that our investigators are drawing blanks. We'll keep you updated.\"\n\nI drove home, but instead of going into the living room, I went into my study. I had some work to do.\n\nI wrote letters, made phone calls. I had to make sure that whoever this was, got punished. I called in favors, asked everyone I knew to make sure the system became impenetrable. Almost the entirety of my remaining 24 hours were spent fighting this. What happened to me could not happen again.\n\nFinally, I had to make a choice. My son was in hospital, so I chose to ring him. Sitting down in the living room with my wife, the phone connected;\n\n\"Dad?\"\n\n\"Son, I just wanted you to know that I love you, with every fiber of my being. Don't ever forget that.\"\n\n\"Dad, I know. And I have something to say. The doctors had a procedure to try. They told me it was risky, that my time was nearly up. They needed a little extra, ten seconds or so. I hope you don't mind.\"\n\nI don't think he knew. But those were the last words I heard, over the soft tears of my wife.\n\n--\n\nI took inspiration for this from the movie *In Time*, but tried to make it different enough. Hope you guys enjoyed it :)",

            "comment": "\"I'll take it\", I said to the manager of the antique store. He had been describing the ceremonial katana to me for the past ten minutes. It was supposed to be three hundred years old, used only once by some monarch in Japan to exact revenge on his thieving half brother. \n\nI paid the final $700 I had left in my bank account to the manager and walked out, ready to deal the final blow to my little thieving friend. \n\nAs I got into my car to head to his house, I thought about how exhausting the past few weeks had been. I had already implemented half of my revenge plans. From what I heard in news, he was extremely devasted. \n\nI had already killed his only son last week. An entire kilogram of HCN mixed in his school's cafeteria food. Some may say that that was too much, but I had to be sure that he would be dead. Sure, other students at his school suffered, but collateral damage happens in any sort of cleansing. \n\nHis wife, though, she was a tough nut. An ex-LAPD ironically. She was not happy with the marriage, as anyone can guess. Apparently, depts had been mounting up for the last five years. So I called her. \"we have an opening\", I said, \"personal protection to an important individual. Six figure pay\". She agreed. I met with her in an alleyway. She should've know better than to just trust anyone offering money blindly. \n\n\"your husband is to blame for this\", I said to her as I quickly pulled out a desert eagle. But before I could fire, she had pinned, in the blink of an eye. \nTill that point I was hoping I wouldn't need to pull out that stupid drone. But she has me against a wall, about to call 911. \n\nThis drone was programmed to come to my location, identify the aggressor, and gun them down with the mini gun attached to it. And I could initiate that program with just a thought, which I did. We are truly in the future. \n\nAnyway. So before she could call up the cops, I could hear the drone coming in the distance. Two seconds later, it was finally there. She was dead before she could look up. The drone had fired accurately, and painted the alleyway walls with her guts. Quite an exhilarating experience, if I do say so myself. \n\nI finally reached his house. It was being protected by the police. All I needed was a small distraction to make them go away. I had a bag full of hand grenades. So I tossed about a hundred of them their way. The explosions were quite spectacular. \nWithout wasting a moment, I stormed in to what was left of his house. He was lying on the floor, visibly injured. I had studied human anatomy extensively this past week, and knew exactly what to do. I walked up to him and quickly cut across his jugular vein. Blood started spraying in all directions. My body was ready. I stood in front of his body with open arms as his blood covered my entire being. It tasted delicious. This was not only a compensation for my $10, but also a triumph over evil. \n\nUnfortunately, this meant that I had to return to my daily routine starting Monday next week. I also had to think about the $86000 hole in my account. That would be quite boring, if I do say so myself. ",

Now, this guy knows me, he knows me well. I still remember the last time we spoke. I specifically remember telling not to worry...\"\n\n- \"Ahhh don't even worry about it, Donny, it's only $10, put that fuckin thing to good use now, eh, haa!\"\n\n\"But $10 meant a lotta money back the 80's, son...I was saving that money, I meant to buy your mothers wedding ring with that money...plus the money I had left in the bank...$86,400 to be exact\"\n\n\"I was almost willing to let it go if Donny didn't keep pushing me, Frankie! Believe me I thought about it a million times but I just couldn't help my self, son...it was torturing me, Donny been giving me shit all 10 years we worked with each, he stole my lunch for 7 days in a row, one day after the other every time I reach out for my goddamn tuna fucking sandwich Donny with his fucking goddamn foul tuna breathe had already ate it, that son of a bitch!\"\n\n\"I'm telling you he deserved everything that came to him that night...if only it didn't cost me this much...and for what? Look at you, you're a handsome young man Frankie, and all I really wanted to do was what was best for you but I guess that was me rotting in this here jail cell for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"I didn't talk to your mother for 2 weeks, I was out in the apartment planning like goddamn Robert Di Nero in Taxi, getting ready to fuck up his life and get my fucking $10...and my pride! Back!\"\n\n\"The night of the attack I stayed up all night...looking out the window, observing Donny's every goddamn move, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes in an empty apartment, all by myself...I had to do it that night...I remember jacking off to the site of Donny's ugly naked wife taking her clothes off in the bathroom and fingering herself while she had the bottom of her toothbrush up her ass, like the freak she looked like!\" \n\n\"...but I couldn't help myself, Frankie! I had been away from your mother for so long, I hadn't slept with her since Donny took that $10 from me...\"\n\n\"So that night, dressed in all black, I decided to go out there in the dead of night to wrap Donny's car entirely with scotch tape. Back then, Frankie, nobody had ever done that...completely wrap someone's car in tape? Who would ever think of that? And besides! If Donny couldn't get to work the next Monday he was bound to get fired! With the way he's been acting at work I knew it\"\n\n\"That night I went down there. I saw Donny go up to his apartment...his wife fucking herself in the bathroom and going to sleep...so I did what I had to do, I brought with me enough tape to wrap the entire car...\"\n\n\"And filled with the ecstasy of a having my plan work out I headed over to the local bar to have a beer and conclude my 4 months hunt if ole Donny...but my night wasn't over yet...apparently, what I hadn't known about Donny was that he was an occasional heroine shooter, the police later found out that he used to shoot heroine on Saturday nights, he would done Sunday morning but they had to go to church, then.\"\n\n\"Donny crept down in the middle of the night to get the heroine out of his car and saw what I did to it prematurely. So instead of figuring it out he went to the local bar to get a gram from the bartender who apparently was also the local drug dealer and he saw me, Frankie.\" \n\n\"Me and Donny locked eyes, I was clad in black and Donny was in his pajamas. He stood there for a long second before cracking a smile. He came over and ofcourse wondered what the fuck I was doing there in the dead of night at this 24hr bar no one was at but me. And right there I confronted him about the $10, to which he proceeded to take out a bunch of cash from his pocket, give some to the bartender and a 10 to me...without saying any word to the bartender, who went inside the moment he got the cash.\"\n\n\"I told Donny I was sorry but Donny didn't know I was the guy who did that to his car, he didn't care the guy was shooting heroin for crying out loud why the hell would he? I mean would you Frankie?\"\n\nFrankie: \"No dad, no. I wouldn't have given a fuck either, to be honest.\"\n\n\"But the worst was yet to come...\"\n\n\"After the bar I was a little but drunk, and decided to let out my demons for one night and gamble at this underground \"casino\" at 4 am. I ended up betting what was left of my bank account money, Frankie...the ring, the house...everything. I got drunk that night and pulled the gun I had bought in case the thing with Donny went south and started shooting everybody there...the dealer...the players...I ended up killing 3 of em and wounding 6. And thats when the cops came and took me in...I was slurring, I hadn't slept well in months...it was a nightmare, Frankie..\"\n\n\"And when your mother told me she was pregnant when I was in jail I almost killed myself, Frankie for what I've done...honest to God Frankie. I tied a not and jumped off a chair but the rope couldn't handle my weight and it ended up breaking...I felt so embarrassed...\"\n\nF -\" well what happened to Donny pops?\"\n\n\"I was told Donny OD'd that night and was found dead on the toilet...with a toothbrush up his ass I was told...nobody thinks they're gonna die that way, huh Frankie?\"\n\nF- \"No dad.

            "comment": "When you put things down on paper, things sound stupid, this phase usually begins once you start to question your actions. Now this, my friends, is a stupid story and it all began the day I won the darn money. \n\n\"34, 37, 12, 96, 25\" screamed the radio during the warm and slightly humid month of August. I looked at the damp ticket in my hand and turns out they were the magical numbers. I was thrilled to have won something like this. Never had I ever held faith in something like this. \"Lucky me!\" I thought to myself as I made my way to the radio station in my beat up Ford. The transaction was quicker than I thought it would be and I crawled tiredly into my cramped, shit hole of an apartment. Things were looking so good for me and I was happy, really really happy. I could now easily pay my alimony. I decided not to rush it and deposited all the money into bank. \n\nI sat down on my couch and tried to relax, but this was overwhelming, it really was. I called up my bud Jake and told him about the news. No one really knows you until you got the dough (hey don't judge me, I know 80k doesn't qualify to be \"dough\" but it is a lot). I was a relatively lonely human being. I worked at the local laundromat. It had a crappy pay and I was borrowing money from my parents to pay for the house. Jake and I went to have some pizza, I obviously insisted that I would pay. 30$, nothing fancy. Turns out Jake the cunt saw me enter my pin and made a transaction on the internet. My phone beeped and a link led me to the purchase. It was a Minecraft player skin. I called up Jake but he must've blocked me. I was enraged, I head out to the bank to get my pin changed. I never knew where Jake lived, we met up at the occasional party and then at the Bar, but that was about it. \n\nI was determined to find out where this guy lived, he stole my 10$. I needed to find him. In these scenarios money doesn't play a major role no matter how it sounds, it's the individuals shortcomings that do. I flipped through craigslist and found a private detective willing to search for the guy at just 10$ an hour, it was a steal. Two months quickly ran by, I was chilling in my new apartment when I got a phone call from my guy, \"YOU GOT SCAMMED, YOU DUMB SHIT\" \n\nNo worries. I hire two private detectives this time. One to track Jake and one to track the guy from craigslist. I quickly drained 30 grand over the next 3 months. \n\nFinally, my guy found Jake. He was in Ohio. I then killed him in an alleyway and a homeless man saw me commit the crime and even recorded it on his flip phone. I was convicted of 1st degree murder and plead guilty. I lost the rest of my money paying my lawyer. But whatever. Jake can't use his dumb Minecraft skin now. \n\nI am sorry that this story is full of shit. I don't know how to write and would appreciate tips ",

                    "comment": "If you'll permit me to offer a couple of tips?     \n\nYou've got some good ideas: for example, that the money was not stolen as a note/bill, but rather that it was used to make a purchase - this is perhaps more justifiable in Jake's eyes. Explore the motivations of the characters more - what makes them tick? Why did Jake make the purchase - is it because he felt you wouldn't miss it, having all that money? Had he tried to ask you first? Was he broke, or just greedy? Why did he only make a $10 purchase?  \n\nAnd secondly, embrace the flaws or holes in your story, make them sound intentional. There's always going to be things that don't fit, but make it look like you know that. For example, \"It sounds crazy, right, that I didn't know where the guy lived, the guy who was apparently my best friend in this whole word such that he was the first one I invited out after winning all that money? But hey, I suppose in this day and age, where everything is communicated through the internet, I'd never had reason to go round to his house. I regret that now. Oh boy, do I regret it. But the fact remains that I had no address, no effing suburb even, to help me find that cheating bastard.\"",

            "comment": "When i was at college someone stole 10 bucks from me at a party one time, I sorta knew the guy but not to much but he had a very distinct look. The area where my dorm was a fairly bad area for crime so i thought it might of amde a mistake but after talking to a few people i found it that it was this guy but noone really knew him. \n\nAlthough i only saw him once or twice after that. I've always felt determined to get some payback. Never really had anytime to act on any of it but with this inheritance I've got from my old grand pops I came up with a brilliant idea. I still can't believe the old cook left me this, i guess he didn't want it going to his kids since they tried to rip him off at every turn, he left me $50,000 and box of his crap. First I hired private investigator that set me back $10,000 in start up costs, i then paid him another $20,000 to keep tabs on him for 4 months. During this time he documented his routine, his hobbies and interests, who he talks to and he doesn't like, hell even what brand of conditioner he used in that rat nests he calls a haircut.\n\nWhen when he had enough intel, i brought in the hitman, Now these guys don't come cheap and i wanted it done right, so i found one on the dark web from a library computer (Using grand pops library card i found in a wallet from his box of crap) Checking over my shoulder every couple of seconds I managed to find a professional and all for the low low price of \u00a325,000. Half before the job and the rest when it was done. I arranged a meet with my PI and Gun for hire to discuss the target and plan out when would be the best time to \"whack\" him.\n\nI gave the go ahead, the date was set. 9th March. Two weeks away. I went about business as usual but took the day off that day. That way i could transfer the rest of the money straight away and not get on the bad side of an professional assassin. I waited around all day...still nothing but then late into the evening i get a text: \"It's done\". I call my PI to confirm it and everything checks out. I transfer the rest of the money and say goodbye formalities. \n\nThe next day was saturday so I decided to check the news, not expecting to see anything straight away due to general news coverage doesn't really extensively cover members of the public death. But when i turned on the TV and changed to the news the first thing i see is a familiar face with the caption: \"Biggie Smalls Shot Dead\".",

            "comment": "*Checking my bank account, I notice that $10 was withdrawn from an ATM (I never use ATMs, always go to the bank)*\n\n[*Dials phone*] \"Jim, it's me. I've been compromised, there's nothing left to do but burn the money. I will leave $10,000 in a lunch sack in the dumpster next to Bennigans, I need answers ASAP.\"\n\nWhile Jim was getting me the answers, I gathered the rest of the supplies. $20,000 spent at the Heet industrial factory to procure over 2,000 gallons of methanol, the main ingredient in their fuel line winter additive. $20,000 spent at a roach killer factory to procure 3 tons of boric acid. Went to the whiskey distillery and dropped another $15,000 in empty oak barrels. The remainder was spent on random essential supplies: rope, candles, the rental for the trucks to move the equipment.\n\nOn the way back to the house, I received a phone call.\n\"...1542 Janost Avenue, red truck in driveway if home, single male, mid 30s. Been scamming cards at restaurants and skimming micro amounts throughout the year to avoid suspicion.\"\n \nA week passes and a utility truck remains parked across the road from 1542 Janost Avenue. The occupant is mid 30's, tall balding and slightly overweight. He works at a couple of restaurants and works every day so far, leaving from home in uniform. He consistently leaves at 9 am and returns on or around midnight. \n\nOn Saturday, the occupant departed for work on schedule. A penetration test was conducted to seek any alarms or video surveillance. There was none and at that time the preparations begun.\n\n50 oak barrels were rolled into the basement. When methanol and boric acid are combined, they create a substance which, when burned, create a green fire and intense heat output.  The barrels stacked against the wall are all linked by cannon fuze, wax, and candles.  The stage is set and awaiting the star of the show.\n\nWhile counting down for the subject's return, a perusal of the house revealed very little trace of the offender's activities. In fact, the house was very orderly, everything from the kitchen to the home office was in pristine condition, almost as if brand new and taken out of the box yesterday. As night drew near, one final sweep of the bedroom revealed a shoe box hidden in the bed frame. The contents were credit and debit card information written down on napkins and loose paper. Lifting a false panel on the bed revealed all the tools to make counterfeit cards: 3D printer, magnetic tape, and assorted periphery to reproduce credit cards. \n\nA few hours before midnight, the snare was set in anticipation of an early return. Sure enough, around 11pm a car pulled in- a red truck. The unsuspecting target parked the car and does not seem startled or alert, and approaches the house as usual. Unlocking the door, he entered and attempts to turn on the lights. To his dismay, the power seems to be off, except for a dim glowing light coming from the basement entryway. As he slowly moved toward the faint light and passed completely beyond the threshold, in an instant and with a sharp snap, the prey is struck upon the head from behind and the door is shut.\n\nSeveral hours pass and the unconscious man slowly comes to, realizes he is tied to a chair and begins to struggle.\n\n\"It won't help\" shouts a voice from the shadows. Though there are candles in the room, they are faint, raised close to the ceiling and reveal very little detail of the rest of the room.\n\n\"Look man, I'm sorry, alright? If it's about the money I'm so fucking sorry, you can have it back, you can have ALL the money!\"\n\n\"This isn't about the money. This is fate taking it's course. You have meddled in something you shouldn't have. Set immovable gears in motion. Once put into motion they cannot stop.\" \n\nA figure from the darkness grabs a candle from the oak barrel lined wall and holds it close to his face. \n\n\"Now don't get me wrong, I'm no hero or shining knight or dirty cop bullshit, this is one hundred and ten percent personal. Yea, there's something moral there about hard earned money. But this, this is all about making it right **for me**.\"\n\nThe figure then sets the candle on the ground, revealing that the ground was wet with some sort of dark fluid. He disappears, his footsteps tromp up the starts and across the hardwood floor to the seeming front door. There is an acrid smell in the room, like acetone. A few minutes pass after futile struggle. The chair is nailed to the floor. The man is handcuffed to the chair by the ankles and wrists. The chemical smells effect greatly his ability to yell for help.  \n\nAs his eyes adapt to the darkness he Is able to make out more details. It seems clear he is in his basement but it's smaller than remembered. After a few more minutes, he can begin to make out the outline of barrels stacked along the walls, from floor to ceiling all around the solitary open room in the basement. Minutes go by, and upon closer survey he begins to realize that the candle was set down in a puddle, which winds around the entire room along side the barrels. The candle has burned halfway down.\n\nHe begins to scream, fight his restraints more. He attempts to pull his wrists thru the hand cuffs but they're latched so tight against his skin that it's impossible even while attempting to dislocate his hands. Furious, fear-induced convulsions did little to improve the situation, the metal chair would not budge or bend.\n\nIn the final moments, it seemed the candle would extinguish in the wax rather than light the puddle. But as luck would have it, the wick fell in the liquid, igniting the barrels in a blaze of green flames, the intense heat and pressure caused the barrels to explode, releasing more solution to catch fire. In an instant the house nearly exloded out of the ground, lifting the house three feet in a cataclysmic explosion of green fire and thunder. As the house fell back down, tampered support beams collapse, causing the whole building lot to collapse into the ground and basement and the firey intense green flames. The victim is melted into the metal chair just before being crushed by the home. \n\nOutside, the explosion shuddered the ground like an earth quake, adjacent lot buildings glass windows break. In an instant, the house went from a two story building to a green firey pit, sunk into the ground with the exterior looking like logs in a camp fire.\n\n\"Yuri, the deed is done. I need a new identity and refuge house. I'll be at the Orthodox Church tomorrow, see you then.\"\n",

            "comment": "\n\nThat $10 was the last gift of my dying wife. Before she died she had handed it to me and told me to buy bitcoin. I did and now I was rich but I kept the $10 bill as a reminder of happier days. He had taken that from me and now he would pay. \n\nHe thought he had a clean get away when he mugged me. But I saw his license plate. It had cost me $200 to get a private detective to run the plate. Edward Richter, mid twenties, enrolled in a local community college. He drove Uber to make money. I followed him for a few days then a plan began to from in my head. It wouldn\u2019t be cheap. But I had $84,100 in the bank account and I would use every penny to have my revenge.\n\nFirst, I bought an exact replica of his car. It was a 2011 Prius and after the custom work to make it look exactly the same as his down to the VIN number it ended up costing me $25,000. It was worth every penny. \n\nNext, I bought an abandoned building close to the routes he tended to drive. I found it on foreclosure but it still set me back $50,000. It took another $9,000 to renovate the building the way i needed it done. I had $100 left in the bank. It was just enough. Then I waited for the perfect day.\n\nThe next saturday I woke up early. I knew Edward slept in on saturdays so I was able to swap his car out with the replica one with ease. Then I waited for him to wake up and start picking up Uber passengers. After I few hours I put in a request for an Uber ride to the building. It took me a few tries to get him.He picked me up and drove to the building. He tried to make small talk with me. I just stared out the window silent. \n\nAs he drove up, he said \u201cthis place sure is strange looking.\u201d I pulled out a $10 bill. \u201cWhat\u2019s strange is the things people will do for $10.\u201d I handed it to him and got out of the car. \u201cI heard him say \u201cfreak\u201d under his breath. I laughed as I pushed a button in my pocket. His car doors locked. In front of him, the car door on the building began to open. I could hear him clicking the unlock button on his car but nothing happened. His car began to fill with gas as it drove into the building. \n\nAn hour later I had pulled him from his car and chained him to a pole. When he awoke he looked at me and screamed \u201cwhat do you want with me you sick freak?!\u201d I relpied \u201cI wanted something to remember my wife by but you took that from me. So I\u2019ll settle for your pain,\u201d I pulled out a $10 bill. I placed it between his fingers and pulled. I saw the pain as the paper cut his skin. I was only getting started. \n\nAn hour later he hit his limit. \u201cKill me!\u201d he begged. I continued to cut. \u201cI can\u2019t take this any more man. Tell Martha I love her.\u201d I stepped back, astonished. \u201cWhy did you say that name? Martha! Why did you say that name.\u201d Martha was the name of my dying wife. \u201cIt\u2019s my mothers name.\u201d he said.\n\nI was ashamed. What had I done? Would Martha love me knowing what I had done? \u201cMartha was my wife\u2019s name.\u201d I told him. \u201cYou stole the last thing I had that reminded me of her, a $10 bill.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry man. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d \n\nI knew I had to let him go. To make it up to him I invited him over to my house where we watched Batman vs. Superman together. We became best friends.\n\nThe End\n\nThis was my first time writing one of these. Hope it doesn't suck too bad!\n\n\n",

            "comment": "86,390: \nRobert Schafer is the name on my card because that is my name. The account numbers are right, the pin is right. But the account is 10 dollars off. I knew it wasn\u2019t right when the ATM spit out the receipt documenting my account balance. I was only slightly irritated by this. It was when the bank kept calling me to confirm the use of my card that I got unreasonably mad.\n\nThe card was used in New Mexico, at a Taco Bell. One of two things must have tipped off the bank. One: I don\u2019t live anywhere near, and have never been to New Mexico, and Two: I have never eaten at Taco Bell a day in my life. \nThe bank reimbursed me the 10 dollars, but it took no less than 6 phone calls, 2 visits to my local branch, and, and 1 piece of paper signed. That all took 16 dollars for gas.\n\n86,384:\nMan was I pissed. It\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s the principle of the matter. They stole from me. Moreover, they stole time from me! Time wasted going to the bank, on the phone with managers, and sitting in waiting rooms. \nNo. This could not go unpunished. I had never been to New Mexico, but it was time I worked on my tan. So I started driving. I drove for eleven and half hours, almost non-stop. Gas was remarkably cheap. 72.11 cents for the one way trip. Snacks were around 27 dollars, as I stocked up so I didn\u2019t have to stop any more than I needed to. \n\n86,284.39: \nI had driven to New Mexico without a thought. Almost in a rage the entire way. The only thing that kept me calm was the musings of an Ellen DeGeneres audio book my Mother left in my car when she borrowed it last week. Ellen told me to keep on dancing. That I would find a way through this trouble time, or some such shit I didn\u2019t believe, but entertained so I didn\u2019t drive off the road and smash into a tree.\n\nIt was a blind rage. I didn\u2019t even realize I was seething, even as I talked through gritted teeth to order my hotel room. How long a stay? Until I\u2019m done. And I\u2019m not going to be done until I at least look this person in the eye and ask them \u201cwhy?\u201d \n\nThe total of my hotel came up to 6,753.49. Not mention all the hotel food I bought which\u2026shit\u2026too many receipts at this point. I\u2019d say, roughly, another 1500 dollars. I\u2019m going to round all my prices from here on out. This is giving me a headache. \n\n78,030.90: \nNot doing so bad I guess. I did some reconnaissance of Taco Bell. Luckily for me, they had old fashioned diner right across the street. I would eat lunch there just to make it look less suspicious. Then I would stay there for 4 hours at a time to make it look exactly as suspicious as it really was. The tab there was another 600 dollars. I had a lovely waiter named Rob. We hit it off right away, seeing as we are both named Rob. He was funny, kind, but never gave me a discount. I didn\u2019t mind. I kind of respected him for it. Business oriented. I liked that. \n\n77,430.90: \nI sat a few days at the diner before I realized I had no idea what I was looking for. I emailed the bank, and they sent me a security picture of the person. It was not very well done. It was a man in an AC/DC shirt, and a red baseball cap. I couldn\u2019t tell but it was probably one of those \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. I hate him even more now. \n\nNow that I knew what I was looking for, I needed real spy equipment. The shit you see in the movies. I was off to Best Buy. One Canon camera (with extra-long lens): 1600 dollars. 4 extra batteries (so I would never run out of juice): 120 dollars. A wall charger (to charge all my dead, yet cool spy shit): 50 dollars. Binoculars (just to look cool): 200 dollars. A bag to hold it all (because frankly, it\u2019s a lot of stuff): 100 dollars. Now I looked even more suspicious when I got to the diner. \n\n75,360.90:\nI hadn\u2019t really thought through what I would do if I caught this guy. Probably a strong word or two? A punch to the mouth? It was all such a whirlwind. Just as I was musing the pain I could bring on this unknown assailant to my bank account, I saw a man, looking just about like the guy from the picture, walk into the Taco Bell. Black AC/DC shirt and a MAGA hate.\n\nI saw red, and not just his poor choice of headwear. \n\nI was so mad, I left all my super cool, spy shit on my usual table, and stormed over to the Taco Bell. I burst through the door, and into the line of fat people, to see my nemesis at the front of the line. I cut through the sea of cows, and right behind him. Just then, I see the man pay for his meal with a card, which has none of my info on in it. It isn\u2019t even the same color. \n\nBut I see his name. John Johnson. I restrain myself from any interaction, and the herd complains that I cut them. I leave before things get too serious, and back to my designated table at the diner. I type his name into the internet, and pay a 50 dollar fee to search get all the information that I can get on this guy. Address, phone number, landline. Who the hell still has a landline?? This republican fuck, that\u2019s who. \n\n75,310.90: \nI scope the Taco Bell and see the guy come back a few more times over the next few days. He loves it. I can\u2019t wait to knock the chalupa right out of his mouth. But by this point I am frothing at the mouth, and ready to go. So I start asking around seedy motels, and bars about places to buy things that I am not supposed to have. Namely in the vein of things that go boom.\n\n\u201cBreaking Bad\u201d was right. This stuff is easy to find in New Mexico. Everyone is looking for a dollar, but they charge a lot of money for it. Apparently filing serial numbers off of guns that were stolen from the police makes the price of said guns go up. Way up. It took me another 75,000 dollars to get the guns, and enough ammo to take on the Alamo. \n\n310:90: \nWhat I am about to do, there is no coming back from, so I rented a car as a getaway, and I get the insurance because I am about to fuck this thing up. That costs 300 bucks. Then I order my last lunch for 10.65. Rob stands over me, giving me my last order of Chicken fried steak, and notices me shoveling it into my mouth, my face changing different shades of red. \n\nHe sits across from me, and asks me if everything is alright, and at this point, my story just flows out of my mouth. All the gory details. Cross country trip, expensive hotel bill, my cool spy shit, and my new collections of untraceable death. Rob is taken aback, but he listens. Oddly, I feel better letting it all out.\n\n.25: \nRob sits silently after I finish off my story, and polish off the last of my last supper. I had been so blinded by rage, my singular purpose, and the thought that what I was doing was justified by \u201cthe principle of the matter\u201d that I forgot everything else. Rob then tells me he too had a mix up with his bank. He pulls out his debit card, and our numbers match identically. Apparently his name is Robert Schafer too. Even more apparently, they sent him my card by mistake, and hadn\u2019t realized, even after they sent me through a slightly inconvenient hell to fix it.\n\nHe says he pays his bill from his savings, and hardly ever uses his debit card. He works three jobs just to make ends meet, because his wife stays at home to take care of their newborn son. He comes into this job every day for the lunch rush. He says the last time he used his card was several months ago, to buy ten dollars\u2019 worth of Taco Bell for his starving family. \n\nWe sit silently. My rage has been completely drained, and now I own a bunch of crap I don\u2019t need, or want. My actions were illegal, psychotic, and borderline murderous\u2026all over 10 dollars. 10 dollars that New Mexico Rob needed more than me. I thank him, and leave him my bag of spy goodies, telling him to pawn them for as much as he can get from it. I take the rental car into the desert and bury the guns, seeing as I have no use for them, and the guy I bought them from doesn\u2019t exactly have a return policy. \n\nI returned the rental, and used my very last quarter at this pay phone to call you, so I could ask you a question.\n\nCan I borrow ten bucks?\n",

            "comment": "Before \"the incident\", I lived a pretty decent life. I had a great job, a nice house, a wonderful wife and two beautiful children. When the bombs started going off, I realized how little I had...\n\nNorth Korea finally lost their shit and launched nuclear warheads directly at the United States. President Trump declared war on their tiny country and I guess they decided to go out with a bang. So North Korea fired everything they had at the U.S. Naturally, the military retaliated. Suddenly the whole damn planet was firing weapons of chaos at each other. When it all ended, there were few safe havens left standing. Mostly small countries away from former super powers. The aftermath is a world with almost no possible means of survival. Things like food and water are priceless. Other items we held of value are mostly useless.\n\nThat is, unless it could burn...\n\nThough my small town was spared from the blasts, the cold ravaged our city. Winter is long and harsh now. More so than one could imagine. Just stepping outside you were risking your life. In order to stay alive, the few survivors left burned whatever they could to get warm. \n\nI remember burning everything I possessed in order to keep my family safe. When there was nothing left in my home, my wife and children were sitting in a corner holding each other close and trying to get feeling back in their fingers and toes. As I sat there, wondering what to do, I began drifting off to sleep, it was at that moment I remembered my lock box. My f****** lock box!\n\nMy wife and I saved money for years for our children's education. We wanted them to have the most bright futures and lives with as little hardship as we could manage to spare them from. I looked at my family with eyes filled with sadness. They weren't moving as they huddled close. I knew I had to get them some fire as quickly as possible. My body felt stiff as I was literally FREEZING! Despite that, adrenaline kicked in and I ran as fast as I could upstairs and pulled the latch to the attic. The ladder stuck but I was able to pull it down with my body weight. Quickly climbing up, I ran to the back corner of the room. Placed here was an old chest with a false bottom. I sighed in relief as I removed the bottom board from the chest. The lockbox, which at this point might as well be the holy grail. My wife and I hid it away so that our children wouldn't find it and spend it. I wanted to keep the money in the bank for savings interest, but my wife was old fashioned and wanted to just save all our cash in a box. Of course we compromised and decided to save all our cash in a box. My wife called it \"the piggy bank\".\n\nThe lockbox was sealed with a key. Not having any clue where the key was, I quickly smashed the box on the floor with all my might until the damn thing broke open. As the paper bills flew out all over the floor, I grabbed them all and ran back down to the living room where my family was located, snuggling for warmth by a fireplace with no fuel. With this I could save them. I WOULD save them.\n\nI whipped around the corner and yelled to my wife, grabbing her shoulder and shaking her, \"Honey! We're going to be ok. I remembered our kids' stash! Do you still have that last match?!\"\n\nThere was no response...\n\nI started violently shaking her and my children. Yelling at them and then begging them to just wake up. I had found more fuel to burn. Why wouldn't they just wake up?? All I could do was hold them as I sobbed into their hair. My tears becoming a stream of ice upon my cheek.\n\nThat night I sat there beside the burning fireplace, cursing the Lord and hating myself for being unable to protect my family. I had lost everything. Why was I still alive? I hated myself all the more because I was still fighting to survive despite not having my family. They were all that mattered. I should just die so I could be with them.\n\nHumanity is a bitch though. Survival is something we naturally strive for, even if we don't want to. As I lay there curled up by the fire, I began counting the money or \"fuel\" I had left. Though only the physical number of bills was important and the dollar amount didn't matter, I counted it out anyway. Somehow, we had managed to save up $86,400 for our children's tuition. I'm not sure how much there was before I started burning the money, but this is all I had left. I lay there with my family, now lost to the bitter cold and drifted off to sleep with them. Maybe I would go in my sleep. Although I found if I stack the money tightly, it burns more slowly, it still doesn't last very long.\n\nI woke up some time after to the sound of my front door opening. My eyes shot to the door only to find a man dressed with gigantic fur pelts covering him from head to toe. The only flesh I could see on the man was his face. He simply stared into my eyes with a look of mixed emotions and said, \"Sorry to wake you. I saw the smoke coming from your chimney and thought I could warm up a bit here. Burning money won't do much for that, but it's great for getting a fire started. I only took ten bills and a couple cans of beans. Good luck to you. I'm sorry about your family.\" Afterward, he pulled up a cloth to cover his face.\n\nThen he was gone...\n\nI shot up and my eyes raced all over. Panic had set in. Did he take anything else? How long was he here?? I had so many questions eating away at my mind. Suddenly remembering the man's words, I jumped over to our \"piggy bank\". I counted the money again and again... eighty-six thousand, three hundred and ninety dollars. Over and over I reached the same amount. It was true! This man had just robbed me of my children's college tuition! I had plans for this money! Dreams of both my son and daughter going to Harvard or Yale. The end of the world and the death of my children put a stop to those plans, but the emotions were still there. My heart ached. I wanted to vomit. I stared blankly at the pile of money before me, then rage began to boil within me like I had never felt before. I burst out the front door and scanned the environment around me, but the man was nowhere to be seen. The icey tundra was all that lay before me.\n\nUnable to bare the cold any longer, I rushed back inside and lit another stack of paper. I didn't even bother to check the value of the bills, not that it mattered. Watching the flames of life in the fire place, I felt a sense of calm wash over me. I suddenly understood my purpose! I knew exactly what I had to do...\n\nI started by gathering every article of clothing I could fit on my body and some old goggles and gear my wife kept from a ski trip with her sisters, and then I burned down my home of sixteen years. I watched it burn for a moment before heading out. I plotted every possible location that might still have survivors or resources for survivors in my mind. Once I had a good idea of where I was going, I started moving, each step filled with more purpose than the last.\n\nPaper money didn't serve the same purpose as before, but I was certain it could be used for bartering. The only thing I was able to recall that made that rat bastard of a thief stand out were his eyes. They were two different colours. Someone must have seen a wanderer like him and those eyes were an easy way to identify my prey.\n\nMaybe I had gone mad, but I didn't care. There was no room in my heart left for thoughts of sympathy. I was going to find the mix-eyed man, and I was going to kill him...even if it cost me every last bill I had...\n\n(A little long-winded, but I hope you enjoy it anyway)",

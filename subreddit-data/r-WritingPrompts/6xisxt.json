            "comment": "It was, more often than not, the smiley ones I watched out for. While I checked their IDs, their gazes would frequently flicker over to their friends for support. The more jittery among them would chatter away with quotes plucked directly from the latest Fortune magazine or how \"buying their own place was the best thing to happen to them\". If only they knew they weren't the only ones saying those things ...\n\nInevitably, after about fifteen seconds of my careful, silent scrutiny of their spotless plastic cards, the first tracks of sweat would begin to appear on their foreheads. Their conversations would die down, and the fidgeting multiply. The desperate ones would say, with frequent glances over my shoulder at doorway through which pulsing lights and throbbing music emerged, \"Could we, uh, hurry up? Our friends are waiting for us inside.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but you're underage. This ID isn't valid,\" I said.\n\nSometimes, I wished I could just tell them the truth\u2014that I could identify crap-all about them from the card. The printed numbers meant little against the large , glimmering digits floating above their heads. It'd taken me several childhood years and the help of a mirror to figure them out, but they made me damned good at my job.\n\n\"This can't be right,\" the young man said, jaws tightening even as a visible, nervous shudder coursed through his body.\n\n\"I'm guessing, seventeen?\" I almost laughed at his shocked expression. Jerking my thumb toward his older male companion, I said, \"Your brother'll just have to take you elsewhere.\"\n\n\"C'mon, let's go,\" the other man said, pulling him out and shooting me one last dirty look.\n\nSuch was the life of a street-level NYC bouncer. As I was writing down the ID's details on a register, I heard the clicking of heels approach. Next moment, a slim, small hand slid an ID card onto my podium.\n\nI looked up and did a double-take\u2014literally jumping back a step. She was pretty, more girl-next-door than supermodel, with loose auburn hair hanging to her shoulders framing a lean face. About five feet tall, she wore a tight-fitting black dress that terminated at mid-thigh, though her figure wasn't anything more spectacular than I'd been seeing for the past hour or so.\n\nSo, your typical college girl lookalike ... but for the number above her head.\n\nThree thousand and nine.\n\nWhat. The. Hell.\n\n\"There might be an issue with your age,\" I blurted before I could stop myself.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" she said in a faintly European accent. Other than her mouth, the rest of her hadn't moved at all\u2014even the fingers clutching the purse in front of her were like cold marble. I could feel goosebumps popping up on my arms as I reached for her ID.\n\n\"Sorry, just give me a moment to check,\" I said, darting furtive looks at the age number above her head as though I expected it to change at any time. I'd never been wrong before; perhaps this was the first time?\n\nHer name was Helena Ricci. Born here in the US twenty-two years ago. I ran the scanner over it. Clean. Shit.\n\n\"Er, I'll need just a moment to register you into our system,\" I said.\n\n\"Take your time. I've got plenty,\" she said. Her eyes remained cold above her smile.\n\nOnce the process was complete, I handed the card back to her. \"Have a pleasant evening.\"\n\nShe took the card and stalked off into the club. I felt tempted to go after her\u2014so many questions were in my head\u2014but that would mean revealing my gift. And one didn't go around spouting such nonsense so easily, so my dad had warned me.\n\nSo I threw my attention back to the impatient and growing line of patrons waiting for me.\n\n***\n\nThe hours flew by. I kept an eye out for Helena among the clubbers trickling out. Once, I thought I saw her in the midst of a small group of men, who went and lounged by a Levante parked not far away. They smoked for a while before returning to the club.\n\nAt about four in the morning, when activity was visibly slowing down, she left the club, flashing me a grin on the way. That, more than anything, helped make up my mind.\n\n\"Helena,\" I called, jogging from my post to catch up to her. \"I've got something I want to ask you.\"\n\nShe paused in her step, but maintained her distance out of my arm's reach. \"Yes?\"\n\nI tore my eyes away from her numbers and met her searching gaze. \"How old are you?\"\n\nShe snorted. \"Really? We're still not over this?\"\n\n\"I can see people's ages, above their heads,\" I said in a rush. \"I've always been able to\u2014since I was a child. And I see that you're\u2014\"\n\n\"Quiet!\" she snapped, looking around almost fearfully. \"You must be dreaming, or imagining things. I'm only twenty-two, recently graduated\u2014\"\n\n\"That's bullshit,\" I said. \"I've never been wrong. I know what I see. And I'm most definitely not high or anything.\"\n\nShe scoffed. \"Stay away from me, mister. I've got Mace here in my purse.\" With that, she hurried away.\n\n\"I told you my secret. Don't I deserve a little truth from you?\" I said.\n\nShe stopped in her tracks and turned her head halfway. \"I never agreed to a trade.\"\n\n\"I won't say anything to anyone, I promise,\" I said. \"I just\u2014seeing you is almost the same as NASA revealing that alien life exists on the Moon or something. Can't you imagine what it's like for me?\"\n\nFor a long time, she remained quiet. I could almost see the gears turning in her head. At last, she said softly, \"Fine. Come, I'll show you.\"\n\nElated, I followed. She didn't speak to me as we traversed the silent, shadowy streets, but I held my tongue as well. If I asked one question too many, she could turn me away.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, we arrived at an unmarked red door in a back alley, sandwiched between two dumpsters. I frowned at our surroundings, suddenly realizing that if she wanted to rob me\u2014or worse\u2014I wouldn't be discovered until the next week probably.\n\nShe knocked on the door, but instead of a rapping sound, musical notes floated from somewhere inside. Then, it swung open to reveal a heavily bearded giant of a man. His fierce gaze took one look at Helena before his expression melted with warmth, and he wrapped his arms around her.\n\n\"Who is this?\" he said.\n\n\"With luck, someone smart enough to keep his life,\" she said.\n\nI tried not to gulp as the man held out a brick-like hand for me to shake. \"I'm Olander,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm Jeff, pleased to\u2014holy crap, you're over a thousand years old,\" I said.\n\nHe blinked in astonishment. \"How did you know? Oh, Helena, what have you brought us?\"\n\n\"He might be useful. Shall we go in?\" she said.\n\nOlander led us into a long, stone tunnel with an arched ceiling. It looked extremely cramped for the big man, but he hunched his shoulders in a manner that indicated familiarity. The two of them spoke in a language I didn't know. Somewhere in the distance, there was a constant gush of water\u2014perhaps we were near one of the city's waterways?\n\nMoments later, we reached another door, this one made entirely of solid, carved wood. I had only begun to marvel at its surface when Olander pushed it in and revealed the chamber within.\n\nI gaped, open-mouthed, at the twelve Roman columns supporting a ceiling of painted frescoes, spaced around the cavernous place lit by huge chandeliers and colorful wall-mounted lanterns. In the center of the room was a fountain almost ten feet tall, crystalline water spilling from the top into three descending circular pools and sparkling with light.\n\nPeople of various races and attire filled the room, mingling in small groups; eating from the buffet tables, drinking, admiring paintings hanging on a section of wall, or listening to an orchestral quartet on a small stage.\n\nAnd above all, I was stunned at the numbers everywhere. Two thousand and eighty-two. One thousand five hundred. One thousand and six. Three\u2014freaking three\u2014thousand, seven hundred and forty-four.\n\n\"How?\" I stammered. \"What is this?\"\n\nHelena didn't answer except to point at the fountain. And then it dawned one me. Before I could inquire further, she pulled me back out of the chamber into the tunnel.\n\n\"Would you be interested in a new job here at our club?\" she said.\n\n\"I, er ... what job?\"\n\n\"Doorman.\" She sighed. \"You see, we can't have too many of ... us ... running around the world. Defeats the purpose of actively staying out of the history books, if you know what I mean. Anyone below a thousand must not be allowed in\u2014sometimes, it's really hard to tell. But you already know that with your current job.\"\n\n\"I'll have to think about it,\" I said. My head felt like it was about to split apart. Those people ... some of their clothes looked like they predated writing. \"Are there ... younger people ... trying to get in, too?\"\n\n\"More than you know,\" she said in a grave tone. \"Olander takes care of them, usually, but it's really insulting if you turn away the wrong patrons. And grudges can last for a long time with us.\"\n\n\"Well, you already know we have a great healthcare package, networking opportunities, insurance and investment returns. I won't pressure you to give me an answer tonight,\" she said, going to stand in the doorway. \"Take your time. I'm in no hurry.\"\n\n***\n\n*Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it.

            "comment": "My eyes flitted over the crowd of people lining up. 26, 30, 14 - gonna have to turn her away - 22, 8988, 21, 43. I slowly looked back towards the big number. That's an 8, followed by a 9 and two more eights. I took a few steps to the left. It's all one number. That... shouldn't be right. It couldn't be right. But i was never wrong before, and i don't know why i'd be wrong now. \n\n\"I'm going to have to I.D. you sir.\" The man smirked. \n\n\"I don't look *that* young, do I?\" \n\n\"Sir, i'm going to have to insist.\" I had to see it. I was sure that his I.D. would hold some clue. \n\n\"How young do I look? Take a guess.\"\n\nI couldn't resist the urge as a smirk invaded my face. \"Dunno. 17, 16, maybe 8988?\" \n\nFor a brief moment, the man looked at me in shock. Then he burst out laughing. \"You're a funny guy. I wanna buy you a drink, when does your shift end?\" I looked towards the bar door as Leon - the other bouncer - stepped through. \"Now.\"\n\nWe headed inside and sat down at the bar. I insisted that he just get me a beer. He had the hard stuff. We both sat silent for a few minutes. \"So I suppose you know i'm immortal, then. I won't ask how. What you're probably wondering is why someone as old as me is in a bar drinking his liver to death.\" I arched an eyebrow and looked at him. \"History repeats itself every few thousand years. On my first time I was in a bar like this. Tomorrow's special, y'know.\" He had a happy, yet tired look in his eyes. \"It's my birthday tomorrow.\" I smiled, but his face became frustrated. He took a large swig of his drink and, with a roll of his eyes, said \"Oh, and the world's ending.\"",

            "comment": "I've always seen them. The numbers. It took me a long time to figure out what they were, and longer still to learn to pretend they weren't there. \n\nMy family took me to a psychologist when I was young, he thought they were a visual hallucination. None of the pills he proscribed me worked, but I pretended they did at the last batch. I didn't want them trying surgery.\n\nIt wasn't long after I left school that I realised I could use this... talent... to be the perfect bouncer. I did pretty well for myself, ended up working the door of one of the bigger clubs in the city.\n\nThat is why, late on a Friday night, I was winnowing through the line queuing up outside the club. The lights from the club over the street were bright and strobing, the music pounded through the air mixing with the shouts and laughter from the crowds stumbling and weaving their way between each raucous island of light and noise.\n\nI almost missed it, distracted by two drunks arguing across the street. A flash of an impossible number. My eyes must have been playing tricks, mixing two numbers from people stood close together. Surely.\n\nThen suddenly, there she was. She was stood in front of me, ID in hand. She had a nervous smile, her eyes were a pale green and her skin was almost luminous and smooth, pale as alabaster. Long hair tumbled about her shoulders, down her back. It was gold and yet it seemed like shimmers of silver cascaded through it when it caught the light. \n\nAbove her head, impossible, floated the number  1391.\n\nI stared. Had I finally jumped off the deep end? Had I burst a blood vessel in my brain and my ability was going screwy?\n\n\"Um... hello? Could I... um... go inside? Please?\" Her voice was soft, she had an accent I couldn't quite place, melodic like singing.\n\nI startled out of my reverie and took her ID, \"Sorry,\" I mumbled, examining the plastic card, checking it against our registry. It was real. Tara  White, aged 24. But I had never been wrong before. What the hell was going on?\n\nI handed the card back to her, \"You can go in,\" I said stiffly. I couldn't bring her up on it. The ID seemed real and I couldn't hold up the line. Besides, what would it look like if I started asking if she was over a thousand years old? It was preposterous.\n\nThe impossible girl gave a bright smile, \"Thank you!\" She vanished into the club and was gone.\n\nI was preoccupied for the rest of the night, it made it hard to concentrate on my job. Thoughts of the mysterious girl whirled through my head. Who was she? What was she?\n\nI did not see her again until the club wound down and emptied in the early hours, and in the flood of people leaving I did not realise she had passed me until I saw a flash of silver-gold rounding the corner. By the time I reached the next street she was gone. My heart fell. I'd lost her, my only chance at finding out about that damn number, gone.\n\nI was despondent the next day, I'd blown it. I'd never see her again. By the time midnight rolled around on Saturday I had managed to convince myself it was a fluke. I must have imagined that number... even if I knew in my heart that I had not. Still, it was the only way I could put the mystery out of my mind and I had almost succeeded when I caught those shy green eyes again in the queue.\n\nI looked up sharply, and sure enough the 1391 floated above her head mockingly. Beside her was a tall man, probably pushing seven feet. He had shoulders broad enough to make Atlas envious and his skin was as dark as her's was pale. He caught my eyes and the blood drained out of me. Terror, deep and primal washed through me. I felt like a gazelle staring into the eyes of a lion. For all those brown eyes were soft, they were deep and dark and I felt like I was drowning.\n\nHe held out his ID, said nothing. Every motion was measured and precise, he moved not an inch more than he needed and there was a terrible fluidity about it. An effortless, predatory grace.\n\nIt was only then that I realised what number was above his head and a new terror filled me, my limbs trembled and my heart seized in my chest.\n\n12,150.\n\nI swallowed hard, fumbled for the ID. It too was real. He was Alexander Roberts, aged 28. I handed it back, gestured for them to go in. I could not trust my tongue.\n\nThe man gave a thin smile and ushered Tara inside. When they were gone it was like a heavy weight had left me and I gulped for breath. My hands shook.\n\nI took my break early and rushed to the staff bathroom, I splashed cold water onto my face. The shock of it helped but my hands were still trembling. I felt nauseous. Why had that man had such an effect on me? Who the hell *were* they?\n\nThankfully I did not encounter the terrible man and the shy girl again that night, but over the next few weeks Tara became a regular. She would always come on the weekends, sometimes with her terrifying companion and sometimes alone. I quickly noticed that she was always sober when I saw her, no matter how late she had stayed at the club. She never seemed to leave with anyone, though she seemed to often get hit on in the queue and probably more often still at the bar itself. She always deflected these advances... at least the ones she noticed. A lot of the time she seemed to not realise she was being flirted with at all. \n\nShe was always quick to smile, there was a shy earnestness about her and an almost frightening amount of curiosity. It made me wonder just how she was related to Alexander. The man still made me uneasy even if the terror of him had lessened.\n\nI waited until Tara came without her protector, as I had come to think of him. It was a Sunday night, the air was getting colder and the crowds a little thinner. She left the club early today and before she could vanish like she always did I called out to her, \"Tara, I need to speak with you a moment. It is about your ID.\"\n\nShe turned, confused, \"Is there something wrong?\"\n\n\"Your ID is fake, isn't it? You aren't 24. I can see people's ages. I know you are much older than that. You're nearly 1400, aren't you?\" I watched her eyes widen slightly.\n\n\"Th-that is ridiculous, of course I'm not! No one lives that long,\" she protested, pulling away from me.\n\n\"I have never been wrong before. What are you? Who are you?\"\n\nShe looked around nervously as the crowds of drunks still wending their way to the last embers of revelry still smouldering in the early hours, \"Not here. Come with me, and I will explain. I can't risk someone overhearing,\" she turned from me and gestured for me to follow.\n\nI had little choice. I had to know who she was, how she could be so old. I followed, and soon we were lost in the crowds.\n\nWhatever explanations my feverish imagination had come up with in the past few weeks, they paled to nothing in the light of the truth.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nApologies if there are any spelling mistakes or nonsensical sections. I wrote this on my phone and it has started to shove words I already did into the middle or end of sentences once I complete them. Such as turning \"paled to nothing\" into \"patheyd nothing\" or such.\n\n**EDIT 2**\n\nPart 2 in replies",

                    "comment": "Tara led me away from the crowds, the lights, the drunken slurring. I realised, as we entered a cramped, dim side-alley, that if she had her friend waiting for me that I would be very screwed. Just as I was debating whether or not to make a run for it, she stopped. \n\n\"This should be far enough. No CCTV cameras, no one around... good. I don't like having to mess with security footage. I mean it's easy but it's just so... inelegant,\" she turned to me, eyes soft, smiling, \"You're an odd one, you know. Seeing ages like that. It's rather obvious what it is, of course, but I've never seen it manifest like that,\" she peered at me, as if searching for something, \"Not to mention this is the first indication of Arcana use in a human.\"\n\n\"In a human?\" I echoed, \"Arcana? What are you talking about? Why did you bring me out here?\"\n\nShe blinked, \"Oh! Oh right, sorry. I was thinking out loud to myself, it's a bad habit. Right, well... it's a little difficult to explain. My name is Tara Ilendi, I am a professor of Xeno-Anthropology at the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Knowledge, one of the oldest universities of Aerin. I am... well... not at all human. I've been on your world for a few decades now, doing covert research. Compiling a detailed overview of the cultures, civilisations and meta-civilisations of your planet. It's the sort of thing they like to have on hand for when a planet reaches technological maturity, which yours seems set to do over the next century or so. It's the sort of document that's quite useful in a First Contact scenario.\"\n\nI stared at her, silently, for a long moment. All the gears in my brain had ground to a halt. I'd expected that she was a wizard, or had found the fountain of youth, or was a vampire or... something. But aliens? Honest-to-god *aliens*? She didn't look like an alien. Then again, I suppose that was the point.\n\n\"Soooo,\" I said slowly, \"You're an alien.\"\n\nShe nodded, \"I suppose you could say that, yes.\"\n\n\"An alien. Like... tentacles and ray guns and flying saucers?\"\n\nShe giggled, eyes sparkling, \"Well *I* don't have any tentacles, and our ships look nothing like flying discs. I don't have a ray gun myself, but my partner does. Or well... not a ray gun, really, more a directed-radiation weapon.\"\n\nShe seemed serious. She looked serious. Was she serious? She had to be pulling my leg. I mean, come on. Aliens. I mean yeah, that'd explain the four-digit age but... aliens. From space.\n\n\"Prove it,\" I said, staring at her, \"Prove you're an alien. Turn off your disguise or beam me up to your mother ship or something.\"\n\nShe blinked, tilting her head, \"Uh? Well... I do kind of want to get a few scans of your brain...\" she said musingly, \"Oh, you wouldn't mind would you? If I got a few brain scans? And maybe a tissue sample. You wouldn't happen to have a family history would you? Has anyone else in your family experienced anything like the number thing?\" There was an almost unsettling fierceness in her eyes that made me take a step back. This girl could be scary when she wanted to learn something.\n\n\"Spaceship first, brains scans later,\" I said firmly, \"I'm still not entirely sure you aren't having me on.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" she said, pouting - and dear god she looked far too cute to be some sort of freaky alien - before she shook her head, \"Stay close to me, and try not to leave anything behind,\" before I could say anything to that she wrapped an arm around my waist and raised her wrist towards her mouth - it was only then that I noticed the slim, plain silver bracelet she was wearing, \"Thyr, could you blink me and a guest over to the ship? Yeah, I know about the rules but I have to get some data on this one.. yeah, it's the bouncer. Ugh, fine just do it already!\"\n\nI only had a moment to wonder what was about to happen when the world went... odd. It only lasted for a moment but I could of sworn I saw the colour happiness and tasted mauve. I am not even sure what mauve *is*.\n\nWhen the world re-asserted itself, I stumbled away from Tara, grasping at a wall to steady myself. I felt almost drunk and it took all my willpower not to retch. Through bleary eyes I saw her giving me a sympathetic look, \"Translocation sickness. Happens to all of us the first time. Just breath and it'll pass in a few moments.\"\n\nShe was right, even as she spoke the nausea faded and the world stopped spinning. At last I could take in my surroundings, and they were almost disappointingly plain. It was a small circular chamber, the walls were silver-grey and seemed somehow luminous. Other than that, it was featureless. \n\n\"We're in the airlock,\" she explain as I turned to her with a frown, \"Gotta cycle through the decontamination procedures first. You might feel a tingle over your skin, but don't worry about it.\"\n\nNow that she mentioned it, my skin did feel kinda weird and tingly. I could feel the goosebumps rising. Suddenly there was a single, low tone and a round aperture just... dissolved into existence in the wall ahead of us. Tara smiled and gestured for me to follow.\n\nWell, I'll be damned. She actually was an alien.\n\nI followed her, the opening led out onto a T section. Tara took the left-hand path, \"The other way is the cockpit  I I guess you'd say, at the tip of the ship. Think of it like a fat teardrop shape. We're in the narrow bit, most of the ship is this way,\" she led me to a much larger circular space. It was... homely. The walls were soft, warm colours accented here and there with cream. There were shelves inset into the walls at regular intervals, stuffed full of books. There were paintings too, one large one was particularly prominent. A triple moon-rise over a silver sea under foreign stars that shone like diamonds in the dark, the shore desolate and empty but somehow beautiful. There were masks too, some made of wood, some made of porcelain or bone and one looked to be made out of chitin. The faces these had been made to cover had never existed on Earth's green fields. \n\n\"Take a seat,\" she said, gesturing to a seat that flowed into existence out of the floor. The material of the hull moulding and shaping itself into a reclining divan-like thing. Tara giggled at my shocked expression, \"Flowmetal, programmable matter. A form of nanotech. The whole ship is made of it. Go on, sit, it's perfectly safe,\" she demonstrated by reclining on her own seat that formed opposite mine.\n\nI sat gingerly, feeling rather awkward now. This was an actual alien. I was in a spaceship. How the hell was I supposed to act? Was I being judged? Would an alien cruiser just nuke Earth if I broke some weird alien rule against breaking wind or something?\n\n\"So... uh.... aliens. Huh. That's... um... mind-bending. Cool, though,\" I said hastily. Please don't invade my planet. \"You wanted brain scans? You know where the ages come from? Why I can see them?\"\n\nShe nodded, \"It's a form of Arcana,\" she said, \"That's what my people call it anyway. You might call it magic, or manipulation of quantum states or whatever. It's not strictly accurate but magic is how it was used by my people for a long time. Think of it like this; the universe at its most basic level is just energy. Matter is energy tightly bound into particular patterns, with these patterns binding together to form more complex patterns and so on. Quarks, protons, neutrons, atoms, molecules, stars, galaxies, that sort of thing. My species was naturally able to manipulate these energy-patterns. It isn't just atoms and stones and stuff, though. It's also relation, causality, probability the past and the future. The actions of individual people, of groups, of societies, these are Patterns too. It all fits together into the Great Pattern or the Tapestry. What you can do is 'read' the Pattern and by doing so you know how old people are. Your brain can't process this information as-it-is and so it has to filter it into something understandable. Translate it. So, you end up with... well... I guess you'd call it a metaphysical synaesthesia. These numbers you can see. I'd like to get a few scans of your brain so the Arcanists back home can see what it is about you that lets you do that. We've not seen any evidence of natural Arcana use in your species before. Nothing concrete anyway, and most species have legends and tales about magic and rituals and the like.\"\n\nI sat there, absorbing all of this. My mouth felt dry, \"So... you're saying...\"\n\nShe gave a wide grin, \"You're a Wizard, Harry.\"\n\n**EDIT**\n\nThis felt like a natural stopping off point. I might make a third part tomorrow just to reveal who \"Alexander\" actually is and why he made our protagonist freak out.Plus the brain scan and... well, whatever else comes up. suggestions are welcome.",

                            "comment": "Since people have been commenting on this - and I'm quite grateful that people like this enough to poke it after... oh good lord, *five* years - I figured I may as well complete the story. So uh, yeah. Enjoy, whoever sees it?\n\n\\------\n\n\"You're a Wizard, Harry.\"\n\nThe words echoed in my head, that teasing gleam still shining in Tara's eyes. I... had magic? I had *magic*? Aliens, and magic. Magic and aliens. Okay, this was all... insane. I felt strange, almost distant, like I was watching myself from outside, like all this was happening to someone else. Was this being overwhelmed? I definitely felt far more than just 'whelmed'!\n\n\"B-bwuh?\" I asked, intelligently.\n\nTara giggled quietly, a hand over her mouth, \"Take a breath, and a moment to let it all sink in,\" she said with a gentle smile, \"Now don't expect to be casting magic missile or fireball any time soon. I still want to get those brain scans and see what's going on; you might just have enough potential for more active, external Arcana usage but we won't know without running some tests... and even if you can I'm quite sure that teaching you falls well outside the rules I'm already kind of stretching by having you here.\"\n\nI swallowed and nodded, trying to take a few calming breaths without hyperventilating in front of the pretty alien woman who, oh yeah, was a thousand years old alien woman. God, what had happened to my life over the past few weeks? Eventually the trembling in my hands subsided, my breathing evened out and the risk of throwing up on my gracious host went from \u2018embarrassingly plausible\u2019 to \u2018safely unlikely\u2019. My thoughts alighted on that name she\u2019d brought up a couple of times now, grasping for a change of subject, \u201cUh, this\u2026 Thyr, is that the uh\u2026 the big guy you\u2019re with sometimes? Alexander? Who is he? A boyfriend?\u201d I glanced around the room, suddenly realising he hadn\u2019t shown up yet and I figured that was odd given how protective he\u2019d seemed over Tara the few, daunting, times we\u2019d met.\n\nTara\u2019s eyes widened slightly at the question and she blushed faintly, before laughing and shaking her head, \u201cBoyfriend? He should be so lucky! No, it\u2019s nothing like that. Thyr is\u2026 I supposed you\u2019d call him my bodyguard, my research assistant and my minder all at once. Ah\u2026\u201d she blushed a little more, \u201cSorry, his name is actually Euthyra, Thyr\u2019s just\u2026 for short. It\u2019s just the two of us, which I imagine is your next question, a smaller team is best for covert research assignments like this and anyway once you get more than two or three high-level scientists in the same room it always descends into an academic dick-measuring contest eventually. Ego is a universal amongst sapient species, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\nI nodded at that, chuckling quietly; people were people the galaxy over, it seemed. I was just glad she\u2019d not taken the boyfriend question the wrong way. That had been a stupid thing to ask, I really had to get a grip because I didn\u2019t even know what she looked like under that human disguise of her\u2019s. \u201cSo where is he anyway? I\u2019d have figured he\u2019d have be here looming at me the moment I got aboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not necessary.\u201d Euthyra\u2019s voice, low and amused, came from\u2026 all around me. I almost jumped out of my seat and looked around, eyes wide. The room was still quite empty of tall, scary men.\n\nI turned to Tara, who was rolling her eyes and sighing, \u201cEuthyra,\u201d she said in a warning tone, \u201cPlay nice, and give the poor man something to look at when you\u2019re talking to him, you\u2019re being rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you wish, Ilendi-Scholar,\u201d the voice said again in formal tone, and besides the divan where Tara lay reclining the floor bulged upwards the shimmering metal melting and flowing into a vaguely humanoid shape before filling in details. Dark grey fur streaked with black, a long, twitching tail, piercing yellow eyes with slit pupils, a dark blue military uniform with edgings of gold upon the collar and along the seam of the coat with golden buttons and epaulettes upon the shoulders and a belt at his waist. There were medals upon his chest too, a dozen of them, some shaped like starbursts with fine filigree detailing, others long ribbons of what looked like silk in green and yellow and red, and one was a simple gold disc with the image of a planet upon it, surmounted by three moons in an arc above it of different sizes all picked out in silver.\n\nEuthyra was\u2026 he was\u2026\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a cat!\u201d I blurted out, staring at him and supressing the sudden urge to laugh.\n\nAn ear twitched, eyes narrowed ever so slightly as the dark-furred feline stared at me, hands clasped behind his back in that stiff posture that was probably universal amongst the militaries of bipedal aliens as much as human ones, \u201cI,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cam a Seventh-Generation Thirr-Karsha Pattern Artificial Intelligence, Vulkruun subtype.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemilitarised,\u201d Tara piped up with a smile and a waggle of her eyebrows, which had the air of needing to be in parenthesis at the end of that lengthy description of what he was.\n\nEuthyra\u2019s ear twitched in her direction, and he very much did *not* sigh but it was rather impressive how so slight a motion could imply one, \u201cIndeed. Luckily for you,\u201d he said as he looked at me and otherwise ignored his\u2026 partner? Employer? \u201cMy appearance is that of a Firstborn; a Moralinri Terelain, a Son of Morlan, one of the Third Bloodline of the Children of Tara and of Terel if one wants to be more formal about it.\u201d\n\nTara raised a hand and wiggled her fingers, \u201cPelenim, the Fourth Bloodline. Don\u2019t worry about the cat thing, convergent evolution. We\u2019re similar to your terrestrial felines in some ways but otherwise quite different. We have silver blood, to start with.\u201d\n\nI took several moments to process the weird alien names that sounded like they came right out of some fantasy novel, and the\u2026 whole cat thing. I eyed Euthyra, who bored my scrutiny with stoic disinterest. It took a few false starts before I glanced at Tara, \u201cS-so\u2026 Euthyra is a\u2026 robot?\u201d\n\nTara immediately winced and Euthyra\u2019s expression turned stony, \u201cI am not a robot,\u201d he said, in a voice that promised my vivisection if I were to use that word again, \u201cThe word robot derives from a word meaning slave. I am to one of your primitive machines what you are to Cro-Magnon, and I am *not* a slave.\u201d\n\nI took a step back and flushed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mean to imply-\u201c\n\n\u201cApology accepted.\u201d Thyr said, in a tone that suggested that further conversation on the topic would be deeply unwise.\n\nThere was an awkward silence for a few moments before Tara cleared her throat, \u201cUm\u2026 anyway, Thyr\u2019s a retired military AI, and I often take a few years or decades out from my teaching position to do field research. Given how dangerous that can be, we made a good fit and he\u2019s become a close and dear friend,\u201d she glanced at Thyr and gave a warm smile, who returned the look with the faintest one of his own and a simple nod in acknowledgement, \u201cHe\u2019s actually the ship itself in a way, since his main processing core is tied in directly to the ship\u2019s primary computer, but he can take physical form using avatars like the one he\u2019s using now.\u201d\n\nSo given that the entire ship was made of that \u2018programmable matter\u2019 that made up all the furniture and Thyr\u2019s avatar, and he was presumably in control of the entire thing and I was trapped right there inside it all\u2026 I swallowed hard and made a mental note to erase the word \u2018robot\u2019 from my vocabulary and to say or do nothing further that might antagonise the scary military AI. Demilitarised or not, I didn\u2019t *want* to find out what creative violent applications he could put that \u201cflowmetal\u201d to. I sat back in my seat and tried to push ever more horrifying mental images of what Thyr could probably do to me out of my head, \u201cWell that sounds really cool,\u201d I said, smiling and nodding at Thyr in as friendly a fashion as I could, \u201cSo if you\u2019re also a\u2026 Firstborn\u2026?\u201d Tara nodded that I\u2019d used the right word, \u201cWhat do you look like then?\u201d",

                                    "comment": "Tara smiled, \u201cNot too dissimilar from this human disguise, really. The Six Bloodlines of my people are generally distinguished by fur colouration, and some cultural and behavioural quirks. It works something like a soft caste system. Moralinri are the military caste, so most military AI identify with them, my own Pelenim Bloodline were considered artists, architects and that sort of things. Academic pursuits were a bit more of a thing for the Second Bloodline, the Aunidieli, but you can consider scholarly pursuits to be an artform in themselves. There is beauty in a well-constructed essay, or a persuasive debate. You also get Moralinri academics, who take to the idea of science as a battle of truth against ignorance and so on. Anyway, the Pelenim are distinguished by metallic fur colourations; for myself, it\u2019s largely silver with streaks of gold.\u201d\n\nWhen she finished speaking, Tara tapped the silver bracelet at her wrist and her human disguise dissolved in a shimmer of deactivating holograms and forcefields and whatever else it had been made of. She hadn\u2019t been kidding about the metallic colours. Her fur shimmered in the light, a cascade of silver scored by gold, her eyes were still green and there was even something of a similarity in her face with the human disguise\u2026 accounting for the whole cat thing anyway.\n\nDid finding her still kind of beautiful make me a furry? I shook that thought away. Now was very much not the time for that. \u201cI uh\u2026 wow,\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re uh\u2026 you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\n\nGreat going, genius. Real smooth. She was going to think you were some weird pervert now and- wait was she blushing? How was she *blushing*?\n\nHer fur colour had darkened, a spreading stain of tarnishing silver and ruddy gold spilling down from her head along her body to vanish under her dress, where it presumably carried on the whole way since I could see her tail also changing. \u201cOh uh, why thank you,\u201d she said, smiling at me a little shyly, \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d\n\nWe smiled at each other, equally a bit shy and awkward about it, when the moment was resolutely broken by a clearing of throat from Euthyra, and a pointed, \u201cIlendi-Scholar, I believe you wanted brain scans performed upon the\u2026 subject?\u201d\n\nTara started, and the darkening colour of her fur got even worse. That was *definitely* a blush. I had no idea how she changed the pigmentation of her fur and it would probably be an indelicate thing to outright ask, so I\u2026 wait, what was that about brain scans? Oh. Oh right. That. I\u2019d forgotten about that. \u201cThank you, Euthyra,\u201d Tara said as she smoothed out her dress and cleared her throat, \u201cIf you\u2019re stilling willing, could you just lay back on the divan and hold still? Thyr will use the ship\u2019s internal sensors to perform the neural scan and upload it to our databanks for analysis later. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t feel a thing.\u201d\n\nShe looked at me with such an earnest expression that I honestly couldn\u2019t say no, and I nodded nervously, laying back upon the divan, which elongated and deepened into almost a bed so I could lay fully flat and comfortable. I did my best to hold completely still as Thyr said, \u201cStandby. Calibrating sensors\u2026 complete. Initiating neural scan.\u201d\n\nMy nose itched. I resisted the urge to scratch it, or scrunch my nose or move. Was that because of the scan, or was it just me being nervous? How long would this take anyway? Would I feel it? I didn\u2019t see any holograms or lights or anything, and I didn\u2019t feel any weird sensations or tingling, so how would I know it was working?\n\n\u201cScan complete.\u201d I blinked in surprise as Thyr spoke only a minute or so after first starting. I hadn\u2019t felt a thing. That was\u2026 both a relief and also kind of disappointing. It was all kind of\u2026 anti-climactic. Noticing that I still hadn\u2019t moved, Thyr said, \u201cYou no longer require to remain still. I have the brain images\u2026 if that will be all, Ilendi-Scholar I shall begin analysis.\u201d\n\nAs I sat up and swung my legs to the floor, Tara smiled and nodded at her companion, \u201cThank you, Thyr. Please let me know when you\u2019ve got the preliminary results.\u201d She turned to me and smiled, \u201cAnd thank you for allowing us the data, I very much appreciate it.\u201d\n\nShe gave me such a warm, gentle smile that even with her feline features I felt my stomach do a double-flip. Yeah this was definitely going to need some long and deep introspection later. \u201cNot a problem, ah\u2026 Ilendi-Scholar?\u201d\n\nShe laughed quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to stand on formalities. Just call me Tara,\u201d she grinned at me, eyes sparkling, \u201cI have images of your brain I think we\u2019re definitely on a first name basis.\u201d\n\nI smiled and nodded, blushing a bit and trying not to show it, \u201cSo uh\u2026 what now?\u201d\n\nShe paused, surprised by the question and then frowned thoughtfully, \u201cWell, I have what I wanted for my research. It\u2019s probably getting late and if I keep you any longer you might get missed,\u201d she said, tapping her chin, \u201cI\u2019ll take you home and we can speak more another time. Besides I think you need some time to just sort of\u2026 sit with everything that\u2019s happened and process it. You\u2019ve had half a dozen shocks to your reality in a very short space of time.\u201d\n\nA certain disappointment welled up inside me that I\u2019d have to go, but she wasn\u2019t wrong. I had no doubt that I\u2019d wake up tomorrow morning convinced I\u2019d been dreaming, or gone mad. I needed the space to actually come to terms with all of this. I nodded slowly, \u201cIf you think that\u2019s best,\u201d I said, trying not to show my reluctance in my voice.\n\nShe must have caught it anyway because she smiled warmly again as she rose to her feet and tapped her bracelet, the human disguise melting into existence over her feline form, once more obscuring her truly alien nature behind its fa\u00e7ade of techno-wizardry, \u201cWe\u2019ll see each other again, if you would like to. Honestly it might help my research, a bit, to have someone actually native to this planet I can question openly. This won\u2019t be our last meeting. Come here.\u201d\n\nShe held out an arm and I approached, a little gingerly since I had a sneaking suspicion about what was happening. She giggled at me and pulled me close, wrapping an arm around my waist, \u201cThyr, two to beam down!\u201d\n\nI stared at her for a moment, quirking and eyebrow as she smirked at me and waggled her eyebrows, but before I could comment the world went funny once again, and for an eternal instant I could see music and feel the colour blue. The world righted itself, and I managed not to throw up on Tara, or stumble this time. I still felt queasy, and like I might have left my spleen behind, but she was right. You did get used to that.\n\nTara smiled up at me with those sparkling green eyes, and I was very aware of how close she was. Don\u2019t kiss her or the planet will get nuked. Don\u2019t kiss her or the planet will get nuked. The dangerous moment passed and she pulled away, gesturing at\u2026 the front door of my house. I glanced around hurriedly but there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone on the street to note our sudden appearance from thin air. She smirked at my expression, \u201cI\u2019m not quite *that* careless. Here is where we part for now, but I\u2019ve hooked up my comm system to your world\u2019s information network and created a \u2018phone number\u2019 for it. I\u2019ve taken the liberty of inserting it into your device.\u201d She took a few steps back and gave a playful salute, \u201cI\u2019ll see you around! Thyr, if you would.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake care!\u201d I called and she winked at me before there was a flash of light and a pop of air rushing into a brief void\u2026 and she was gone. I stared at the empty spot on the path for a long moment and then shook my head. This was the weirdest day of my life. I doubt there would ever be a day like this ever again, nothing could top it.\n\nI fished my keys out of my pocket and opened the door to my house and stepped inside, and it wasn\u2019t until I\u2019d stepped into my kitchen and put on the kettle to have some tea in that comforting and familiar ritual that would surely ground me in the real world enough that I wouldn\u2019t start having an immediate existential crisis that I realised something.\n\nTara had given me her number.",

            "comment": "\"What the fuck\" I thought to myself. This job was supposed to be boring, given my... powers. This wasn't supposed to happen. \n\nSee, I was a bouncer at a bar. I wasn't the most imposing person but I had a unique trait. I could tell anyone's age without seeing a license. The numbers just kind of floated above their heads. I realized I was special at a young age when I asked my fourth grade teacher, mrs. Jimenez, why the new boy was three years older than all of us. We had to have a special meeting with the counselor and my parents. It freaked them out pretty bad when I was able to tell the counselor that I knew she was seven years older than she said (looking back I think she was trying to start a relationship with one of the younger teachers). It took a couple of years to learn to not notice and just live life but I managed to find a way to use it to my advantage when I got this job. \n\nI streamlined the front door, no wasting time carding people, usually I just stood next to Big Jake (he was a left tackle at the local college and an absolute mountain of a man) and told the underage kids to leave before they wasted our time.\n\nTonight was terrifying though. We expected a rough crowd once a month when we hosted fight night. It was common practice in rural Midwestern towns, usually one or two bars would set up a ring and let local fighters put on the nights entertainment. Typically fight night made us sell out of pbr and bud light, with exactly the crowd you'd expect. We always had to break up two or three extra curricular fights but it was no big deal to me, I never did the dirty work, I protected our liquor license. \n\nThis man terrified me though, four digits were hovering over his head. I leaned into Jake and whispered \"something's wrong, ask that guy for I.d.\"  The man didn't look strange, except his hair was straight out of the 80's, mutton chop sideburns and all. He wore a leather jacket over jeans.\n\nThe expression on Jakes face was pure confusion. He asked the man and he pulled out a Canadian passport, which was strange. It said he was in his 50s, which was also strange because he didn't look a day over 32. I didn't know what to do so we let him in. \n\nHe caused no problems, he came to fight and ended up winning two matches and pocketed 200 bucks, drank two beers and left. He barely said a word.  The next day I tried to put him out of my mind. By a week later I had gotten past the shock of it and tried to move on, but the next day life got really strange. \n \nI was home for dinner with my parents when the doorbell rang. They answered and several minutes later my mother shouted for me to come into the sitting room. An old man in a wheelchair was sitting there and behind him stood five people, on of whom was the 1000 year old fighter. I was shaken as the old man began to speak, \"hello James, my name is Charles Xavier. I believe you've already met my companion Logan...\"",

            "comment": "\"28 today,\" you say to yourself looking in the mirror. Of course you know today is your birthday today, but it also helps that while looking at the mirror you noticed the number above your head changed from the [27] you saw yesterday.\n\nYou leave to go to the liquor store to pick up some booze and celebrate. While in line you see this scrawny kid two prople ahead of you. He looks really nervous, you laugj yo youself when you figure out why as you look above his head. [17]. The kid gets to the counter, hands the clerk his \"ID,\" who says that he better run before he calls the police. The kid scurries away. \n\nIt's always been a gift of yours to be able to see the age of people. Thanks to your gift it was pretty simple to find a job befitting of it to get out of doing some actual work. What better fit that a bouncer for a bar. Besides this gift you were also gifted with size, 6'6 and 300 lbs was another big help when applying to be a bouncer.\n\nWith your secret ability you became well known in town as THE bouncer. Sure you looked at ID's of anyone over 21, just to keep up appearences, but anyone you saw abover their head &lt;21 you wouldn't even ask em for ID's you'd just laugh and tell them to leave. \n\nAfter a nice day drinking with friends you were unfortunately scheduled to work. Luckily things are going very smooth this night, no one &lt;21. A couple hours pass and way down the line you see [31], [33], [11], [34], and you think to yourself, \"seriously, someone is trying to bring their kid into this bar? Some people.\" In your state there is a bery clear law disallowing children to be in a bar unless it's a bar/restaurant, which your place was most certainly not. \n\nThe line moves on and on and you get more annoyed prepping to confront this family. As they get closer you see the something is a miss. The [11] is just as tall if not taller than the other numbers you see. You can't quite see the kids face but you assume he's either a really lanky kid or he's getting a piggy back ride from daddy. You think the latter is more likely because the [11] is very close to the [34].\n\nWhen the \"kid\" makes it to you your jaw drops. Standing in front of you was a man, dressed in sharp suit and nearly as tall as you, maybe 6'4. Above his head read [11....34].....[1134]. The silence of your stare was then broken, \"You alright buddy?\" You snap back to your senses, \"yeah sorry about that, may I see your ID.\" The man gives you his ID and it clearly shows \"34,\" you hold his ID for a while again your mind questioning what you saw. Never before have you doubted your powers, could they be off for once? Maybe the booze from earlier is still running its course, but I feel fine. Also I've never had a problem with the accuracy of my ability before when I've been drunk. Also I've read everyone elses accurately tonight as you always check ID's anyw...\n\n\"You know I'm lying about my age on there, don't you?\" The man said snapping you out your train of thought. He takes his ID and goes to walk past you away from the entrance. As he passes you he whispers in your ear, \"[1134] is right, meet me out back and I'll explain everything,\" and with that he leaves you mouth agape walking away down the alley next to the bar. \n\nYou stand there for a sec frozen by what he said until the next guy says, \"buddy you alright?\" \n\"No, sorry,\" and with that you page for someone to switch you out for a break. Your friend comes out and you go on your break. You go down the alleyway and popout behind the bar. Back there you see the only person there, the man in the trench coat.\n\n\"Glad you showed up.\"\nThe man steps closer to you and extends his bare hand for a handshake. You look down and nervously reach out to meet his. You grip his hand and he grips yours, only he keeps squeezing, harder, and harder. Your a big guy you're not about the be intimidated in a strength contest, and you start squeezing back. The man doesn't flinch and he begins squeeze even harder, he begins crushing your hand, it's your complete loss as you fall to your knees you hand limp yet still in this man's machine like hand. He eventually lets go and you bring your throbbing hand to your chest clutching it due to the pain of broken bones. \n\n\"What are you?\" You say through gritted teeth. The man crouches down to meet your gaze.\n\"The name's Egan, seeing the numbers are just the start of your abilities. Why do you think you would be able to see them?\"\nHe pauses, as if looking for a response to his rhetorical question. Obviously you don't know why you were given this power.\nBreaking the silence Egan says softly, \"It's because you also have the ability to take theirs. Come with me and I'll teach you to become a god among mortals.\"\nWith that Egan stands up and reaches out his left hand to you. You take it and stand up, your life changed forever.",

            "comment": "28, 34, 21, and 54. \n\nI remained where I stood, nodding to the guests in silent affirmation that they were allowed in. As they trudged past me and through the door of Barney's Strip Club, I reached into my pocket, fumbled for a cigarette, and stuck it in my mouth.  Now where was my lighter? It would be so much easier if I could just-\n\n20, 17. \n\nUgh. I groaned inwardly. 17? That was definitely not a number that should be here. Time to perform my job, I suppose. \"Hey, you two. Hold it.\" \nI shifted myself into the doorway, blocking the two young men from entering. Behind his expensive looking sunglasses, I could see the younger one already beginning to sweat. Was he really unable to wait for just one year longer? Honestly, kids these days... I sighed inwardly, but continued standard procedure.\n\n\"Excuse me, but can I see your ID?\" \n\nAt the first mention of an ID, they both began to fidget. The younger one kept glancing over at the older... his brother, maybe? Eventually, the older one took charge, handing over two pieces of plastic with an artificial smile plastered on his face. I ignored the small talk he tried to make and pretended to study the cards intensely, while in reality I was rolling my eyes behind designer sunglasses. I didn't know the first rule about being a bouncer, let alone how to identify fake IDs from real ones. All the club wanted was for me to do was two things- keep out the riff raff out, and be good about it. Which suited me just fine.\n \n\"Nice try, kid, but you're going to have to try somewhere else.\" I couldn't be bothered to mess with these two any longer, as my cigarette was getting soggy. I handed back the IDs and glared them off. Any possible protests they contemplated melted like snow upon seeing my iron-set muscles, and they beat a hasty retreat. In my profession, it helps to be a mountain of a man like me. \n\nAnd another thing that helped was this ability. The power to see numbers over peoples heads that showed their age- at first, I thought it was a stupid power, but eventually I came to see its use. After all, I turned out to make a pretty good bouncer, despite knowing nothing of the job. It came in handy for my other business as well. \n\nSpeak of the devil. I was just about to light my cigarette when something else caught my attention. \n\n3,214. \n\nA petite man who couldn't be over thirty, wearing an elegant tuxedo and tie that dripped of extra money, stood in front of me. He looked like your typical, unassuming gentleman, the type who wouldn't hurt a fly. And I might have been fooled by this disguise as well, if not for that 3,214 floating over his head. This wasn't work anymore. Now, it was business. \n\nOnce more, I sigh inwardly. Over 3,000? Then this might actually prove to be troublesome. As *they* get older, they get stronger as well. Feeling a pain welling up in my back from an old injury, I crack my neck around. Then I spit out my cigarette and lumber into the doorway once more, standing above this ancient wonder of a man. \nWell, not that *it* is a man. The *thing* tilted its head in inquisition. \n\n\"Pardon me, but is something wro-\"\n\nI didn't give it a chance to finish its sentence. Pulling back my shoulder, I let loose a full powered punch straight into the face of the *thing*, a clean punch that would have demolished a building. And yet, even as the man goes flying, he's already fully regenerated by the time he hits the ground. \n\n*It* immediately enters combat mode, transforming its arms into pairs of wickedly sharp blades, but I don't give it a chance to use them. Utilizing another power of mine, a more useful one, I ignite my fists into flame, and unleash a barrage of punches upon the creature until its been reduced to pulp. Only once its been melted into a puddle on a ground do I cease my attack. \n\n\"Ha... ha...\" As I pant, I observe the creature for movement, but it appears to be completely and thoroughly dead. Just to make sure though, I light the remaining puddle on fire, and watch it evaporate into the air. \nSticking a new cigarette in my mouth, I light a fire beneath it with the snap of a finger. Then, leaning back against the wall, I crack my neck again, dispelling the misdirection barrier that I had erected around the area. Once more, customers begin to trickle in, and I continue my vigilant watch. \n\nI work as a bouncer, but my real job is somewhat different. It just so happens that *they* like places like clubs, where life energy and youthfulness is abundant. But I'll be here. And I'll be watching.   ",

            "comment": "\"DAD!\" I shouted, as I slammed the front door to the house behind me.  I was in a state of near panic, frantically trying to take my dress shoes off, as I shouted for him again, \"DAD!\"\n\nI heard noise from the living room, the springs of my Dad's favourite chair protesting like they always did, from age and use, as he stood and called back, \"Trent?  What's the matter?\"\n\nRelief washed over me at the sound of his voice, and I managed to finish ripping off my shoes.  Unable to form any words, I simply rushed down the short hallway, to where he was coming into the other end, and threw my arms around him.  The weight of my rail-thin 13-year-old frame barely moved him, and after a split-second of surprise, he wrapped his arms around me. Dad was the only one I could talk to about this.  He was the only one who knew about my power, the only one I dared trust.\n\nDespite being dripping with sweat, I was shivering, but after a couple of moments in the comfort of my father's arms, I was able to draw a ragged, deep breath and center myself.  I eased off the death-grip I had around my Dad's ribs, and backed up a half-step.  He moved his hands to my shoulders as I backed away, looking worriedly at my face.\n\n\"What's going on buddy?\" He asked.\n\n\"I... ju... th...,\" I stumbled over my words, and took another calming breath. \"I was working at the dance, for the golf club, like we had talked about, as the entry-man.\"  The school loved their 'clubs', and loved using them for 'volunteers' for events like this.  I honestly hadn't minded this one.  It was far better than the Halloween clean-up crew 'volunteers', or the 'stack 200 chairs the morning after a meeting in the gym' jobs.  I had even joked with Dad about this being good 'bouncer' training for when I was older.\n\nI'd make a perfect bouncer, you see, because of my gift.  I can read people's age, can see it just over people's heads, almost like a digital clock.  I learned young not to talk about it, learned that it wasn't 'normal', but I was fine with that.  Only 3 people in the world have ever known about it.  Myself, Dad, and Mom while she was still alive.\n\nDad nodded for me to continue, as I searched for the right words, \"We were set up at a table by the fire exit to the gym.  I was checking school IDs, and Nick was stamping hands, and it was really cool, and it was a good time.  Most of the kids from the school were already inside when Vincent Holst showed up with Daisy Redden.\"\n\nDaisy Redden was *the* hottest, smartest, most sought-after girl in our Junior High.  I had a crush on her, and my dad knew that, but *everyone* had a crush on her.  The Holst family was fairly enigmatic in our town.  Vincent, like his parents, didn't socialize much.\n\nI had paused for a second as the memory of their arrival came back to me, fresh again.  Dad prompted me, \"Is that what has you upset, Trent?  A date?\"\n\nI shook my head, freeing myself of the image, and refocused on my Dad's face, \"Wha..?  No, no, not that at all.  Dad, Vincent was dropped off by his parents.  They came over to the table to pay for the entry fee.  That.... that's when I saw their numbers.\"  I began to shake again slightly.\n\n\"Why does that have you so worked up?\"  \n\nI tried to keep a steady voice, but it cracked and broke as my throat ran dry, \"Because his Dad's number was Eight Hundred Ninety-two, and his Mom's was.... was... One thousand Two Hun..Hundred and Forty-Fi..Forty-Five.\"\n\nI'm not sure entirely what convinced him of my sincerity that night, but he stood there and just looked at me for a while before he spoke.\n\n\"Pack a bag.\"",

And it was tedious, but it was possibly the easiest job I could have.\n\n\nChecking IDs was just a formality. the numbers floating above everyone's heads were what really have them away. It took me a while to figure out what they were. I remember when I did though. Standing in front of the mirror on the day of my eighth birthday, as the number above my head morphed from a 7 into an 8. \n\n\nMy \u2018gift\u2019, if you want to call it that, made this job stupidly easy. I didn't have to pay much attention to the contents of IDs. The numbers gave them all away. I'd earned a bit of a reputation with the high schoolers, at least I\u2019d heard. None of them had slipped past me yet. And they probably wouldn't. \n\n\nAfter a while the monotony did begin to get annoying. I'd taken to drinking a little bit, just to make the day more enjoyable. It didn't affect my ability at all, as long as I could make out the numbers. \n\n\nOn yet another night of turning away underaged kids, I was getting bored. Some of the same faces, some new. And then one that was new, but had to be old. That number couldn't be right. 9999. Was the alcohol affecting me? No, that wouldn't make any sense. It never has before. \n\n\nBelow that number, all alone, was a stunning blonde. There were some real model types that came here but, this one, she was something else. As my jaw dropped slightly, I saw a quick smile as she looked away. Glancing back at her ID it said she was 23. I was beyond confused. I mean she was old enough to be in here but, no, that can't be right. After taking way too long, I let her in. \n\n\nIt stuck with me, the whole night. Not one more person had such an outrageous number. I definitely wasn't experiencing some alcohol induced hallucinations. But I had to figure this out.\n\n\nOn my break I looked around the club. She was nowhere to be seen. Glancing at the somewhat empty bar, I spotted a flash of golden hair. That was her, still all alone, somehow. I couldn't help myself. I had to talk to her. I sat beside her and asked for a drink from Barry, the bartender. She glanced over at me and smiled. It was now or never. \n\n\n\u201c So, uh, this may sound weird but, your ID said you're 23, and, I uh, you look a bit older, ah, yeah.\u201d Spoken like a true gentleman. I was kicking myself mentally. \n\n\n\u201cReally,\u201d she asked inquisitively, \u201cand how old do I look?\u201d She didn't sound the least bit offended. \n\n\n\u201cI mean, like at least, uh, 26?\u201d I stammered out.\n\n\nAnd then in a laughing tone, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll take that as a compliment\u201d \n\n\nI couldn't believe she hadn't asked me to leave yet. But that 9999 above her head still had me puzzled. \u201cThere's something I\u2019d like to ask you\u201d, I began.\n\n\nShe looked at me seductively and quietly said, \u201cYes. Let's go to my apartment.\u201d \n\n\nI was dumbfounded. I had not expected anything like this but before I knew it she was leading me out of the club and into a taxi.\n\n\nThe ride there was a blur, I was too confused, and she was to stunning not to be focused on. When we finally got to get apartment, she dragged me inside into the living room. And without realizing I was on her sofa with this jaw-dropping woman next to me. Gnawing at the back of my mind was still that number. She leaned in closer to me and whispered in my ear, \u201c I need you to do something for me\u201d\n\n\nBarely comprehending I replied, \u201cAnything\u201d \n\nShe leaned closer, her mouth right at my ear, \u201cI need about tree-fiddy\u201d \n\n\nI pulled away, staring back at her, when I realized, I was sitting right next to a building sized crustacean from the Paleozoic era. Stunned, it came to me, that that God damned Loch Ness Monster tricked me again.\n\n\n\n\n*Thanks for reading this! I\u2019ve never commented here before, but this ending came to me as soon as I read the prompt. Hope you enjoyed, and tell me what could be better!*",

As if it couldn't get worse, the last number - a five - slowly transformed into a six.\n\n\"We have reservations.\"\n\nThe average-looking gentleman put out his hand and I plucked the driver's license out of it automatically. It read like any other I'd looked at tonight; the birthdate was just a few years before mine. The numbers over the woman's head read as twenty seven.

I'll just have a chat with this guy, okay?\" Jim, the closest thing to a neanderthal you could see outside of a museum of natural history, flashed a thumbs up before going back to checking ID's. \n\n \"So uh, like, what's the problem?\" I glanced at the man beside me. He looked like your average guy, jeans, a white shirt, a healthy sunburn covering his face. In fact if I had been average as well, I'd probably never have picked him out in the first place. \n\n\"Just a routine, random pat-downs to make sure our guests aren't armed. You don't mind, right? It'll just take a minute\".\n\n\"Ah\". His face relaxed and his shoulders visibly untightened. \"Yeah, sure, no problem, it's your job. Where to?\"\n\nI gestured for him to follow me and we started moving towards a room Jim and I got to use for our breaks.\n\n\"So, you been here long?\" \n\n\"Nah, just arrived. Got tired of my job and went on a road trip with my savings. You know, new faces, new places...\"\n\n\"Yeah, I hear ya.\" I unlocked the door and we walked inside.\n\nIt wasn't big, more of a closet than anything else, but there was enough room for a small plastic table, two foldable chairs, and an IKEA-shelf with a coffee pot and a cake Jim brought a few days ago. \n\n\"Sit down, you want some coffee?\" I poured myself a cup and offered him one.\n\n\"No thanks uh, shouldn't we be standing up for the pat-down?\"\n\n\"Yeah, there's not going to be a pat-down. I just needed to talk to you.\" His shoulders stiffened again, eyes wary.\n\n\"Yeah? About what?\"\n\nI sipped the coffee and made a disgusted face. It was cold.\n\n\"What do you want to talk about, man?\" He tried faking a smile. \"Do I look underage or something?\"\n\nI laughed. \"Close, but no. See, I'm good at my job.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Once I started working here, there's been a severe decrease in injured guests\".\n\n\"That's great\".\n\n\"There's also been no underage drinking at this club since I started working here. The local kids don't even try anymore, I'm that good at telling peoples _real_ age\".\n\n\"Yeah?\" He kept my gaze, looking increasingly like a deer cornered by a cougar.\n\n\"As in I can see exactly how old people are\".\n\n\"You mean...\"\n\n\"Yeah. I hate to paraphrase twilight on you, but you haven't been underage in a very long time, have you?\"\n\nHe didn't move, shoulders still tense, eyes locked onto mine. The numbers above his head, the numbers indicating just how many years he had been alive, the numbers I had been able to see above everyones head since the day I was born, read 2709.\n\nHe breathed. \"Fuck\".\n\n\"Yeah. Now tell me: What. The fuck. Are you?\"",

            "comment": "4 digits. For a moment, my degree in mathematics failed me, as I struggled to count the numbers before me. Un, Deux, Trois, Quatre. There was no mistake, though the existence of such a person...frightened me. My vision had always been right, as evidenced by the guilty looks on the minors' faces when I turned them out of the bar. I'd never had to kick someone out for being overage. But 5746 years was a lot of time, far before Anno Domini 1. Was he immortal? A god? Or some old guy with a superpower? I didn't know, and I definitely didn't trust the 'Age: 30' that his ID proclaimed. Maybe my powers had faltered this time. Maybe...\n\nFrom behind, I saw another man slowly approach me, his IDs in his hands. But as he made eye contact with me, his eyes widened in fear. I saw him whisper into the 4-digit-old man, with visible shock on both faces. That was when I saw the age of the newcomer. 5746.\n\nI tried my best to suppress my shock, though I failed miserably. 1 was surprising enough, but 2? 2 men that had lived for the exact same time from so long ago? I was about to demand an explanation, but one of them beat me to it.\n\n\"Why are you 5746 years old?\" he questioned, fear in his eyes. I opened my own wide. Could he read ages too? And was I...that old? No. That couldn't be right. I remembered my childhood, the photographic proof of my birh just 28 years ago. But they didn't seem to be lying, and the mention of that 4-digit number again was chilling. What kind of sick joke was my powers pulling? Or were they the ones pulling my leg?\n\n\"We've found another suspect, boss,\" one said into a walkie-talkie. The other drew a gun from his pocket, training the muzzle on my forehead. \"What are you doing? You're-\" I tried to explain, but he cut me off. \"No more words, time traveller. We've waited long enough to catch you and your gang,\" he replied, smirking as a group of policemen appeared from the darkness. I felt the cool metal slide around my wrists, as I was forced towards the car. \"Move!\" one of them shouted. That voice...I seemed to recall. The cold handcuffs. The interrogation. Disjointed images flashes before my eyes, as they slowly became clearer, culminating in...\n\nI knew now. But...why were they doing this? Was it a plot to throw of the police? \"James!\" I shrieked, to the man I'd once been partners in crime with. He chuckled, though I could tell it wasn't just for effect. I saw the twinkle in his eyes, the signature twinkle he gave when he condemned a foe to death. My other pal Aldrich stood by, his eyes conveying his helplessness. James' face wasn't one of friendliness anymore. It was one of animosity and hatred.\n\n\"Good riddance,\" I saw him mouth, as I was shoved into the car. As we drove off, I could still see him, as he advanced slowly towards Aldrich. I closed my eyes in cowardice, though I knew what would happen. What I had feared when I agreed to sacrifice my memories...it had all occured. There was no way back.\n\nEven inside the driving car, I could hear the terrified screams. The circle of betrayal had been completed.",

            "comment": "It was a typical night in LA. People getting piss all drunk and underage people trying to get into the club, my club. I always laughed at the smugness of some of them. Always compensating with false confidence, it was kind of pathetic. 15 years and a perfect record for keeping out underage guests and they still tried every night. Almost like they had something to prove. \n\nThis night however was about to get strange. I had just turned away a couple of probably seniors trying to celebrate graduation early when he walked up. Clean with a perfectly tailored suit that looked more expensive than anything I could afford with strikingly blue eyes like daggers of ice. His face terrified me. His sunken cheeks and sharp jaw really made him look threatening but the most terrifying part was his age. 8590. After a few seconds he spoke, his voice a flawless British accent. \n\n\"Are you going to let me into my club?\" He spoke with a perfect smile.\n\n\"Yes, of course.\" I replied snapping out of my haze.\n\nHis club? He couldn't be serious, right?\n\nThe next night came and again he came; just as tailored as last night. This time he had a woman with him. I recognised her from somewhere but couldn't place it.\n\n\"Evening, I have a plus one tonight.\" He spoke cheerfully.\n\n\"Of course, sir.\" Who is this guy?\n\nA few hours later both him and the woman exited the club and we're having a conversation on the sidewalk. He was flipping a coin, no spinning. He was spinning a coin as it floated above his palm. Floated. Then it all went to shit.\n\nA car came by with loud rap music playing, a man pulled a gun and began firing on the man and the his guest and then was broadsides by a semi in the intersection. \n\nThe police arrived and questioned everyone. One of the detectives walked up to the apparently new owner of the club at the piano.\n\n\"Lucifer Morningstar?\" She questioned stifling a laugh.\n\n\"The one and only.\" He replied.\n\nThat, can't be. He can't actually be. He'd have to older. \n\nA few moments passed and he walked up to me and said.\n\n\"They only count years I've been on Earth.\" And walked off.",

Another night for some carding and cash.\n\nI rubbed my hands together, urging the friction to do its thing. Wouldn't be enough, though. This January was mighty cold.\n\nI looked up at the line of kids that approached, noting the number above each one. Honest kids, tonight. All 21 or over. I would have managed a smile at the pleasant change if not for the fucking cold.\n\nWhen the last had filed in, Keith patted my shoulder.\n\n\"I'm taking a break, Reader.\"\n\nI nodded as he walked off, leaving me alone to guard the door. I was always the one they left alone. \n\n\"Hey, can we get in, still?\"\n\nI turned to look down at a group of three kids, but instantly saw '19' above the talking one's head.\n\n\"Scram, dude. It's 21 and up.\"\n\n\"You didn't even card me!\"\n\n\"I don't need to,\" I retorted, staring him down.\n\n\"Let us in.\" \n\nI switched my gaze to another one of the street urchins, only to see this one was different. A lump caught in my throat as I opened my mouth to say a word that become lost in a whirlpool of draining thoughts.\n\nThe number above this ones head was 8456. \n\n\"ID.\" I managed to choke out.\n\nI never truly saw his face, only his number. I kept staring at it, knowing I had never been wrong before.\n\nHis ID revealed he was 22 years old, but my eyes illustrated otherwise.\n\nOut of pure shock, or fear, I let the group in, watching the number as they walked toward the muffled roar of downtuned electric guitars and thunderous drums.\n\nI couldn't help but follow inside, forgetting to ask Keith to keep watch. \n\nThe club was dark except for the neon purple and teal lights of the bar. Some local band screeched onstage as I gravitated toward the largest number in the room. Still a distance away, it turned a corner and faded into the restroom. I followed still.\n\nThe bathroom glowed a dirty fluorescent green in an attempt to hide the various stains that covered the walls and stalls. The four-numbered man stood in front of the mirror above the sink, pulling his shirt up to reveal a scarred, swollen, bruised, tattooed torso that twisted at odd angles. The lights flickered and the sound of the band was drowned out by the banging and panting of a couple fucking in the stall.\n\n\"Still going to try and kick us out?\" The man asked, turning to me. I stood, confused, horrified. The old one approached me in the flickering light of the dingy bathroom, the heat and sound of sex amplifying.\n\nHe leaned in close, becoming a silhouette before me. I felt the ancient breath on my neck like the hollow winds that blow over the swelling ocean.\n\n\"You can read me as much as you want, muscle man. That number will only grow larger,\" the old one whispered into my ear.\n\nHe exited the bathroom and disappeared into the crowd as the door swung back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, until the only remnants of the encounter hung in the thick air as a stench of sweat, blood, and piss. \n\nAnd then it was gone.\n",

            "comment": "Nothing exciting ever happens around here in New Zealand. I say that because most people don't even know where New Zealand is, let alone anything that ever happen down here. The fact that I live in a small town about 2 hours drive from anywhere worth mentioning also doesn't help, but I've found a job that fits me to a T. I mean, not every bouncer can see people's ages floating above their heads, right? This is not some Peter Jackson Frightener movie, this is real life. Real life means I have to work for my dues, whatever that means. \n\nI am not complaining about my special ability. Believe me, it is one thing that you can tell how old one person is just by staring at the space slightly above their head, but it is totally awesome when you can see everybody's number. To be honest, it's the young ones that shock me the most. They just don't treat their body right these days. I see their haggard faces every night, standing in the cold, wearing next to nothing. I can tell how old they are, but some of them look closer to thirty than eighteen. Of course you can't let those ones in, it's the rule. I didn't make the rule. \n\nIt is September already. You'd think this winter will finally end and we will get some flowers out of the ground, right? Spring is supposed to be here, but no. It is still freezing. The line isn't very long tonight even though it's Saturday. The place I work for is usually full in the weekend, but not tonight. It has stopped raining though. \n \nI suppress a yawn. We have a group of students with their IDs in their hands, eager to get inside. I don't blame them. Pulling the dark jacket closer to me, I pretend to scan them up and down, and look at their IDs quickly. I don't need to see them or do any mental calculations. I know they can go in. That's why I waved, yes, you have a fun night. Not sure if you will find it in there, but good luck. You will get what you wish for. \n\nI don't know why I haven't noticed this earlier, but I guess it's because the guy from the group was too tall and he blocked my view. My usual icy stare is hard to maintain when the number above the well-dressed man flashed when I look up. I have to stop myself physically, not losing my composure because I know what I saw. \n\n\"Hi, brother. I've come to have some fun tonight.\" \n\n\"ID, please.\" \n\nAs if a card is going to prove how old he really is.  \n\n\"Oh, can you see it with this light?\" \n\nI can hear him alright, but I can't let him through. I've been trying to find him after all this time, and when I finally found him, I am powerless to stop him. Powerless to catch him.\n \n\"I can, and brother, remember why you are here.\" \n\nHe has the audacity to scoff before stepping into the club in his fancy patent leather shoes. \n\nHis number is 6666.\n\nThat's his number. \n\nMy name is Michael and he's my brother. I've been waiting for him forever and this is why I am calling my partner from inside the club. This one can't get away. \n",

            "comment": "I stood outside the bar, hearing laughter and chatting from the warm interior. I looked down the line of people waiting for entry and started looking down the line muttering under my breath, \"Twenty-two, twenty-five,  Thirty, Twenty-nine, and... a twenty year old.\" \n\nI sighed and I could see my breath within the cold night air. \"Alright guys!\" I gestured to the front of the line, \"Come on in!\"  As the first four passed me, I held up my hand to block the entrance for the twenty year old, a tall black-haired boy who *might* have been able to enter as he looked to be at least twenty-three to any other outside viewer. Unluckily for him however, I have an exceptionally rare ability to see the age of any individual floating above their heads. \n\nThe boy looked at me confidently and smiled, \"Is there a problem, sir?\"\n\n\"May I see your ID please?\"\n\nThe boy looked surprised and took out his wallet. \"Alright, just give me a second here...\". The boy gave an elaborate shuffling through his wallet for a good thirty seconds before he finally said, \"I think I might have left my ID at home or something. Can you make an exception please? My friends drove me and one of them just went in, I mean we are literally the same age. Just ask him!\"\n\nI nudged him out of the line and said, \"Sorry kid, no ID no entry.\"\n\nThe boy's previous friendly face slowly contorted into one of utter anger. He looked as if he were going to punch me until he stopped himself. Still clenching his fist with knuckles pale as ice, he stormed off without saying another word.\n\nI sighed and looked at the next one in line. He looks definitely like a kid. I'd guess... ten years old. I used my ability and his age appeared above him displaying... **FOUR DIGITS**. WHAT PERSON IS 7300 YEARS OLD? He looks like a kid too!\n\nHe had auburn hair and was looking at me with wide eyes. I quickly blinked a few times to mask my loss of composure. \"Uh... So, how old are you?\"\n\nThe boy gave a huge grin and yelled in an ear-piercing voice, \"Seven, three, zero, zero years old!\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow and knelt down. In a soft voice I asked, \"Are you lost kid? Where's your mom?\"\n\nThe boy scowled and yelled even louder in a tantrum impatiently, \"I am **seven, three, zero, zero years old!**\"\n\nThere is no way this kid is immortal or something. As far as I know, immortality and reincarnation or anything of the sort is nonexistent. I quickly pat his head gently and said, \"Let's go find your mom, okay?\" \n\nThe kid started sniffling and pointed inside the bar, \"But my mom is inside!\" I gently grabbed the kid's hand and guided him inside with me saying, \"Come on kid. I'll find your mother.\" \n\nWe walked inside the bar with lots of people chattering and hearing the clinks of wine glasses. I grabbed the kid and held him up by the shoulders. I said in a loud booming voice, \"WHOSE KID IS THIS?\"\n\nA thirty one year old whom I assumed to be the mother quickly ran to the kid and hugged him closely saying, \"I am so, so sorry Alan. I thought you were asleep!\" \n\nI shook my head, \"Listen, next time. Watch him closely and don't leave him alone by himself. *Ever*.\"\n\nShe glanced at me and softly said, \"Alright.\"\n\nI put a hand on the kid's shoulder and glanced at the mother, \"By the way, how old is he anyways?\"\n\nThe mother sniffled and wiped her tears with the sleeve of her shirt. She said, \"He's only ten years old.\"\n\n\"Then why does he call himself a 7300 year old?\"\n\nThe mother gave a hint of a smile, \"It's just his way of adding up to 10 years old. The two extra zeroes are just to make him seem smarter with math.\" She ruffled Alan's hair, \"Aren't you smart?\"\n\nIf you enjoyed, consider subscribing to my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChocolateChipWp/)!

A turn of phrase, the way their gaze meets yours, the way the air around them hangs, as though to communicate an unspoken form of reverence. Or fear. Simple folk like to trade their wives tales, attempts at justifying the things that exist just outside their conceptions. Makes them feel better.\n\nI wonder what they'd say about me.\n\nBut my gift, a paltry glimpse into the age of those who cross my path, is nothing compared to the man- er, woman? Hard to tell after so many years. Anyway. Is nothing compared to the figure who comes, every eight months like clockwork, to visit our humble distillery. The first time I met them I thought, sure. Someone's slipped me something. Just because I can see the age of things doesn't make me immune to tampering. And I've been at this for a few decades. \n\nAll this to say, the first time I met the man (at the time) who saved my life, I had difficulty believing he was nearly four-thousand years old. \n\n\"Been around a while, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, I dread to think.\"\n\n\"What brings you 'round the Juicy Jailer then?\"\n\n\"It really wasn't my decision. Just passing through, I suppose.\" \n\n\"Not much inside worth your time, I'd think.\"\n\n\"Well. You'd be surprised what I find when I'm not looking.\"\n\nTurned out he was right, as later that evening we learned the distillery had been housing an underground warehouse what took people and stuffed 'em into tin suits. Sy-buh whatitsorsomething' he called them. Made this dreadful, monotonous speech about \"upgrading\" everyone. But quick as a flash, this man had done them in and cleared out just as quickly as he'd come. I asked for his name, but he gave me his vocation instead. Weird bloke. \n\nBut you never can tell with Time Lords, can you? \n",

My mind was racing and I could feel my body become aware of that I knew nothing about the situation about to enfold between us. Thin soft curls covered her eyes as she rose to meet my widened stare. She instantly knew I could tell she was different, our eyes locked and I felt every fear and trepidation pass from me. She smiled, her face softening as she seemed to download every thing I've ever felt seen or heard. \"Danny,\" she whispered, although I don't remember her mouth moving, \"I'm tired, I've been on a century shift and I just want to have some fun.\" I let her pass through. Honestly something about her absolutely terrified me even though I felt a calm blanket surrounding my physical body. She made me feel like I was standing in front of the biggest mountain or tree Id ever seen. A small part of me wanted to fall to my knees and pray to her to spare me from whatever she was capable of if pushed to wrath. I didn't though, I just numbly went through the rest of the night. Anxiously peeking in to see if I could tell what she was doing. At closing time she walked out following a regular I'd seen many times. A tall guy that brought many girls to the club and none of them looked to happy to be leaving with him after. Id heard he was a bad guy, a date raper, machismo bully and so on. This time her stride was confident, her eyes locked on the back of his head as she trailed him like a coyote. She winked at me as she strode by. \"Bonus\" she whispered. As they walked away my guts twisted into knots as I observed the guys number start to tick down.",

You are not 24.\"\n\n\"What the hell do you know you insolent prick, this ID is more real than anything you will contribute to this society over the course of your lifetime.\"\n\nI sighed. I'd considered not confronting him, letting him pass, but his demeanour was pissing me off.\n\n\"You're outside our age range for the night. We admit individuals aged 21 to 30 here. You sir seem to have missed that cut off range by about two thousand years.\"\n\nHe paled, then turned red. Began to turn, turned back, stumbled in his indecisiveness and would have fallen if not for the press of bodies all vying for my attention. \n\n\"Don't tell me they give you *optorithmen* for working as bouncer now?\" \n\nObviously deciding it wasn't worth waiting for an answer he began pushing his way back through the crowd, and then down the street into the inky night. Historians I find, despite their age, really are idiots. I shook my head and returned to checking IDs. It was never any trouble, after the enclave's gift. Scanning the plastic cards was more of a formality, and a safety procedure, than a necessity. If I turned people away at a glance those who aren't aware would get suspicious. \n\nThe night wore on, and I did my job damn well if I do say so myself. \n\n\nI stepped aside for a break at 11:58. I like to watch the numbers change from 11 to 12 at midnight. As the 31st became the first, I sighed. One more month till one more year left of my contract. Then what. Maybe I should become a historian myself. It could be pretty interesting, but 10,000 years of service for an 11,000 year life extension seemed like a bit of a crap deal. Our historians, like normal dentists, had a disproportionally high suicide rate - that definitely says something. Just because you *can* live for ever doesn't really mean you *should* live for ever. It's not for everybody. \n\nStill there are other cool gifts with lower prices that I'd been thinking about. The enclave will grant you your gift, in exchange for service, and some gifts cost more than others. Usually these gifts allow us to serve above and beyond the normal line of duty, helping Them whenever They needed it. Not every club has people like me working the door, but for high class establishments like mine, normal security doesn't usually cut it. I hear the security are granted *musculi* here, but I've never actually seen them have to use it. Rumour is that big business goes on in the VIP section here, but in all honesty, I'd never seen any proof. I almost agreed with the angry old man. *Optorithmen* was totally overkill for a bouncer job, but who am I to argue with a gift for a job I'd propably do anyway. I figure I'll end up accruing as many as I can, doing odd jobs till I feel they want to get on with me life - plus my additions. A lot of people work till they're given a job too unpalatable to do and then they draw they line. So far I've only had easy work - club admission included. And of course the enclave gives us our years back. I've been working the door here for just under nine now, and when I'm done I expect be given my ten back ASAP.\n\nI rejoin the other bouncers, my break is over. I wonder how many of then can see ages like I can. Technically I'm not allowed to ask. I could lose my job and my abilities if I reveal the enclave's gifts to anybody ordinary. You never know who's working right beside you. I haven't seen any of them around the enclave but that doesn't mean anything. It's big enough that two people might not meet in over a thousand years, if they're working in separate departments. As the night progresses, the crowd thins. The salty historian returns a few hours later, but I shake my head before he can say a word and he storms off again, this time for good. I almost feel bad for him. Cooped up all day pouring over musty texts (old even back in his day) - and then having to synthesise it all into some dry report - would make anybody want to get fucked up on the dance floor, but I have to do my job and he knows it. Slowly the crowd thins to zero and I can go home.\n\nRonny, my girlfriend, might be getting home soon too. She works nights as well. She's a night scout actually - with *optolux* and *auribus* - basically she walks the streets and calls the police when she hears or sees any petty crimes being committed. Much cooler than my job. Cop patrols aren't nearly as efficient as they'd have you believe, so she does their job for them. Actually, she's recently sent in an application for telepathy so she can skip the whole dialling them on the phone thing, but I'd doubt they'll grant it to her. Telepathy is a pretty heavily demanded gift, and the enclave likes to really squeeze you for service for the nice ones. \n\nI call an Uber and text her as I hop in. \"See u soon babe?\"\n\n\"mmhm\" \"home in 20 mins.\"\n\nAs I doze off in the back of the car, a smile flits across my face.",

            "comment": "I check their I.D.'s for fun now, noticing nose jobs and cheek implants and the occasional sex change.   It doesn't matter though... there are always some who try to get past me.   A strikingly beautiful blonde with a shining \"19\" above her head brazenly looking me straight in the eye, not a flicker of hesitation as she hands me a well made fake stating she was twenty three years old.  The three men around her, all with numbers higher than my own glare menacingly as I shine my light on the counterfeit piece of identification.  I decide it's not worth the altercation and let her through but I yearn to just whisper  \"Why are you trying to grow up so damn fast? There's nothing in here for you.\" \n\nI never learned why I could see these numbers, to be honest I thought everyone could, and by the time I was old enough to question it, I knew enough not to bring any more attention to myself.  Now it makes my job easy, and it's a neat trick at parties.  I don't question when women lie to make themselves younger, and yes, occasionally I let someone who is trying make themselves older slide past, into the bar for their drinks and their laughs. Frankly... I just couldn't care anymore. \n\nIve seen it all, women who look thirty five but have a bright \"50\" floating a few inches above their head.  Young men with full beards that would easily pass as mid twenties who are mere teenagers.   It's remarkable, really, the variations in how humans age.  Were I a man of more scientific inclinations I might feel compelled to get to the bottom of my \"gift\".   In truth, I'm typically more concerned with when I can punch out and get drunk enough that the numbers start to blur and I can pretend I'm not seeing the mortality of others... but angels with luminous halos. \n\nEvery week I stand outside the door to a trendy L.A. bar and grit my teeth through the drip, drip of painful repetition. Mine was the sort of redundant occupation that people might complain gave them carpal tunnel.  I used to look forward to the occasional bar room brawl to break up the monotony that has become my life, but as iPhones get larger and pants get tighter and more and more men declare themselves as \"feminist\" it's a rare occurrence that I can't set my hopes on.  So instead I look at these little plastic rectangles and relish in the tiny details they hope won't be noticed.  Live in L.A. as long as I have, and you'll see every nip and tuck. \n\nMost nights, I arrive at the bar by seven thirty, have a beer or two with Lonnie, the bartender, before taking up my post on my wooden stool just to the left of a black painted door.  I've worked at many bars but this bar had the unique distinction of being the only place I'd encountered that put forth an effort to appear seedy in order to sling overpriced whiskey sours to L.A. hipsters who wanted to feel as if they'd spent a night slumming it without any of the real life danger they might encounter were they to venture into an actual slum.  You know the type, they wear ripped jeans that cost as much as my rent and carry folded paperback copies of \"The Old Man and The Sea\" in their back pocket. In other words...real winners.\n\nTonight was no different and after my second beer, some craft bullshit from down in San Diego that Lonnie said, \"We're the only bar in L.A.  That has this.  Some guy literally brews this in his bedroom.  It's totally exclusive\", I took my seat and waited for the string of mullet wearing degenerates to pile in. \n\nAt first I rubbed my eyes, thinking maybe I'd blurred two people's numbers together.  Maybe there was someone walking just behind him, out of view.   Nope, as he got closer I stood up.  The man was a little taller than me.  Not any kind of unusual looking character, but not the typical patron of this joint either.  He wore a simple suit and close cropped haircut, but what I was seeing couldn't be possible.   The man looked to be at most, in his early thirties.  The bright, shiny number hovering just above his dark hair however, showed \"2021\".  I realized my mouth was open and that I was staring. \n\nWhen he got closer he mumbled \"hey\" and reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet, then, just like everyone else, an I.D. Just a normal California license with his photograph, his height, weight, address and name- \"Christensen, Jess H.\"  The birthdate gave him an age of thirty three but my gift had never been wrong.  Ever.  Not in my entire life had a number above someone's head been even a year off their actual age.  This simply, wasn't possible.  \n\nI turned the plastic over and stalled for time, \"So, from L.A. originally?\"   He replied, \"Israel, actually, but it feels like I've been in L.A. since forever.\"   I hand him back the card and he just smiled and walked inside.   \n\nAll night I couldn't get the man out of my head.  Was he some kind of vampire?  Or maybe some monster of an Israeli Dr. Frankenstein? It just couldn't be.  I came to the conclusion that something had gone haywire and my gift was starting to falter.  \"Shit\" I thought to myself, \"Now I'm gonna have to really start paying attention to birthdates.\"   But the rest of the night my numbers always matched the birthdates on the I.D.'s.  It seemed this man was the only one the glitch affected.     \n\n\nThe night started to wind down and people trickled out as bar close neared.  Finally, I noticed the four digit man slip outside.  He stopped to light a cigarette and I don't know if it was the late hour or if it just bugged me too much but I reached over and tapped him on the shoulder, \"Excuse me, man\"  He turned and smiled, this guy didn't seem like a monster. In fact seeing his face made me feel like I'd bitten off half a Xanax, but I persisted, \"I gotta ask, you know, I have this real good knack for reading people and I gotta say... something's telling me you're older than you say you are.\"    What he said back to me... well, it just about knocked me over. \n\n\n",

            "comment": "Part One\n\nI got fired last week for the 9th time this year. \n\nI don't always mean to run my mouth, but when I do, it sprints. This time, it wasn't even my fault (initially, anyway); if only that dumb fucking Russian bartender would have kept his mouth shut. Oh well... No sense crying over spilled martinis.\n\nIt's not hard, finding a gig as a bouncer, especially in cities. After my fourth attempt at holding my tongue (and fists) at a new bar, I bought a camping van off some poor prick who needed the cash to pay for his divorce. Being essentially unhireable makes for a great old-fashioned, transient lifestyle.\n\nA few weeks go by before I start to run out of money. I begin scrolling through ads online, keeping my eyes peeled for job opportunities, but by now word has gotten around about how I told the owner of the last joint to go fuck his hot daughter. Soon, I find myself looking for gigs in the next state over.\n\nPart Two\n\nI don't even look at people beyond their waist anymore, which especially annoys bigger women. Knowing someone's age is like having transparency goggles: you see right through their bull shit. It's great, for professional purposes, but it's put a serious damper on my personal life.\n\nOccasionally, I do look up. If a girl smells good; if a man's voice is resilient and kind. These times are few and far between, but they happen. Like this morning, at a local coffee shop.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" \n\nI looked at the woman's waist. \"Yes?\" I ask, keeping my head low.\n\n\"Are you looking for work as a bouncer?\"\n\nWhat the hell? I look up at the girl with the raspy voice. She's got on heavy black eyeliner and full, plump dick-sucking lips. My gift indicates to me that she is 26 years old. We make eye contact, and I realize that this girl is drop-dead gorgeous.\n\nShe points gently at the stack of potential work ads I've collected and printed out. I feel stupid. I ignore her and get back to scrolling on my phone.\n\nShe stands there a while, both of us uncomfortably silent. Finally, she slides a piece of paper on the table. \"In case you're interested,\" she says, and walks away.\n\nI look at the paper. It reads:\n\nMadame Bijou's\n55 Walker Street\n9pm, don't be late.\n\nPart Three\n\n8:55pm. Fuck, I'm early.\n\nMadame Bijou's is located in a very popular part of the city, in an alley off to the side. It gives off a speak-easy type of vibe, perfect for those of us who don't enjoy teeny-boppers getting too drunk before 10pm. Perfect for me, makes my job easy.\n\nI haven't seen the girl from the coffee shop, but a Stevie Nicks chain-smoking woman who looks just like her approaches me at 9pm sharp. \"Make it to 1:55am and I'll pay you $100,\" she says, pointing at the bar stool next to the door, and walks off. Her age indicates that she's 64.\n\nThe night starts slow, but picks up around 11. I have not seen the girl from the coffee shop, or the older hippie woman. \n\nAround 12am, I kick out some drunk Marines for being douche bags. Around 12:30am, I deny my first group of underagers. Their IDs look exactly like McLovin's.\n\n1:29am comes around, and the whole place empties out, almost like clockwork. Strange, since bars don't close until 2am. I peek my head inside the club, and I see the bartender wiping down the bar top.\n\n1:39am, I close the door behind me as I walk inside.\n\nThe bartender is 41. \"I'd offer to get you a drink, mate, but we have to be out of her by 1:55am.\" I don't make eye contact with him as he says this.\n\n\"I heard. Why not 2am?\" I ask, keeping my eyes on the floor. I can hear the bartender smirking. \"You don't want to know.\" \n\nHe heads out around 1:49am, but I still haven't seen Stevie Nicks. She sure as shit better pay me for tonight. I wait patiently, and at 1:55am, she emerges. She seems to be in a hurry.\n\nShe ushers me out of the bar and hands me a $100 bill. \"See you tomorrow, pretty boy?\" She asks, turning the lock on the bar door.\n\n\"Suppose so, Madame Bijou,\" I say to her. She forces eye contact with me, her smile fading. She checks her watch, sighs, and leans closer to me. She whispers: \"get out of here before 2am,\" and walks in the other direction.\n\nNow I have to know what this is all about.\n\n1:56am.\n\n1:57am.\n\n1:58am.\n\n1:59am.\n\nI guess I expected some sort of apocalypse at 2:00am. When nothing happened immediately, I laughed at myself for being so foolish as to believe in the superstitions of people I had just met. I looked at my watch, which read 2:01am, and began to make my way towards the van.\n\nI took one last glance at Madame Bijou's, and there she was. On the other side of the glass was Madame Bijou, flashing her rotten teeth at me, her wispy gray hair flowing down to her knees. Her age read 3,378. \n\nSomehow, she reached her hand through the glass and pulled me into total darkness. \"HELLO??\" I shouted, reaching for anything I could touch, so terrified I pissed myself a little. I began to hear footsteps coming toward me.\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK, WHAT THE FUCK,\" I panicked, still reaching into nothingness for something to grab onto. The footsteps got closer. \n\n\"You were warned,\" said a voice somewhere in the hollow space around me. Suddenly, a bunch of numbers started to appear at once. 4,707; 2,856; 5,302. I kicked and screamed, until I felt like I could no longer breathe.\n\nI woke up the next morning in my bed, with teeth marks covering my entire body.",

            "comment": "Shane's knees felt stiff. He sighed as he went through the motions of getting dressed: sliding on his shoes, buckling his belt, pulling on his coat. Even the simplest of motions felt like a test of physical strength; \"I'm getting too old for this shit, Riggs,\" echoed in his head. But Shane shook it off. He had a good 12 hours on his feet ahead of him at one of NYC's busiest clubs. He opened his front door and flicked off the last light of his empty, quiet apartment. He was turned to leave, but paused as the hallway lamps illuminated the glass of the framed photo sitting on the stand by the front door. He picked it up, letting just one look at his daughter give him the motivation he needed to get through this doorway. He sighed again, placed the photo back, and shut the door behind him.\n\nThe air tonight was unseasonably warm, though October had proved itself to be a crapshoot, weather-wise, for the past few years now. Shane stood at the top of the stairs of the clubs entrance, leaning against the frame of the double doors. It gave him a surprisingly casual demeanor for the head bouncer. He used the stance to play up the mysterious, silent role he enacted while on the job, but in truth, it was to give his tired feet some reprieve. Regardless of what was behind it, the other door guys questioned nothing. Shane had been in the business for, seemingly, ever; his M.O. was known, understood, and respected by all bouncers. It was simple, really: Shane would give a slight nod to some customers waiting in line, not even glancing at their ID's, while others he would give one shake of the head. Sure, this certainly aided with the image any club wants to create, the \"exclusive\" bullshit. But that was just a lucky coincidence; Shane was, well, uniquely gifted for this job. He always had to laugh, thinking to himself, \"What kind of stupid-ass superhero power bullshit is this?\" But however useless it might be, it was his: Shane could see the age of every single person. No, not a rough estimate or educated guess by looking at sun damage or liver spots. An actual number, above their heads. It could become dizzying and exhausting when amongst crowds, which is why Shane had a tendency to avoid working music festivals or going anywhere with too many people. But to work the door, focus on a single line, was manageable. And nothing ever surprised him, given the club scene. The numbers were always the same small window of low to upper twenties, with the occasional sprinkling of desperate thirties, and the pitifully fooling-no-one-fourties.\n\nBut then tonight, with that odd warm breeze wafting around the bubbling excitement of the Saturday night crowd, he saw something that actually threw him. There was a girl, not unlike any other of the fresh-faced, glowing and smiling young girls in line. Long straight blonde hair, leather skirt, black platform heels, white shirt. He blinked, frowned, furrowed his brow. He watched her, giggling and chatting with her group of friends. Shook his head as if that would change what he was seeing. How? He had seen a young-looking girl or two in their thirties before, sure, but this? He wanted to smack his head, but that instinct would be futile; he wasn't a machine or program to reboot. This was just something he had the power to see. And it was really there: a four digit number. He stared at her, at that number - 7129 - all sound seeming to melt from his ears until a, \"Shane? Shane!\" snapped him back to earth. He saw Brian, one of the other bouncers, looking at him and waiting for either the nod or the no. Shane, completely shaken, gave a loose confirmation that the girls could go in. As they passed him, The Girl looked right into his eyes, and mouthed, \"I know what you can see.\" His mouth dropped and his gaze followed her as she waved goodbye to him and walked inside.\n\n",

            "comment": "It was only supposed to be a temporary gig, until I was done with school, to help make ends meet. I figured since I had the 'gift' I should make some use of it, and since I was young, and somewhat  lacking in imagination/experience, Doorman seemed a pretty easy gig. After ten years of Doormanning, my temporary gig was becoming a lifelong dead-end chore, until the night She arrived.\n\nGun to my head, I would have sworn She couldn't have been more that sixteen years old, but the numbers never lied. There they were, floating above Her head, just as clear as everyone else's, four digits. And not low four digits either, in fact, She must be in the fives by now.\n\nLike I did with everyone who approached me, I asked, \"ID please.\" and She looked at me, She didn't smile, or blink, or anything, she just, *looked* at me. She knew, and She knew that I knew, and that was the last thing I remembered for a very long time. I couldn't tell you what She looked liked, except She was perfect. Not pretty, or beautiful, or sexy, or any of those other words people used then. She was just ... Perfect. Had She told me She was Athena, or Aphrodite, or Eve, or Lilith, I would have believed Her. I now believe that this is the truth of it.\n\nAs it turns out, a ten year stint as Doorman was way more temporary than I could have guessed then. This was over seven hundred years ago. Before the Strangers came, before the Off-World Colonies had even been proposed, and before we all had to learn The One Language. (I still hate the sound of Esperanto) \n\nI know She is still out there, and I know that She knows I am still here. Although there is every probability that we will never meet again, there is still hope. Some days I want to thank Her, some days I would like to try to end Her, (if that is even possible) but every day I want to see Her. \n\nEvery day. \n\n",

            "comment": "I closed my eyes and brought my fingers up to my temples, pretending to be deep in concentration. \"You're 23,\" I said. \"Your middle name is... May... and you're from Gary, Indiana.\" \n\n\"What!?\" Gasped her friend, as they exchanged shocked looks. \"What about me, guess me!\" She said as she quickly pulled a five dollar bill from her leopard-print clutch and tossed it into my jar. \n\nI quickly glanced above the woman's head before closing my eyes and going into my usual routine. \"Okay... 26. Your middle name is Nicole, and you're... also from Gary!\" \n\n\"Oh my god! This is totally going on my Facebook!\" She squeaked excitedly as she walked off with her cellphone in hand. \n\nFour months prior, I wouldn't have predicted that my dumb party trick would have made me one of the most successful street performers in the city. When I moved to New York I pictured myself becoming a Broadway producer or the editor of a famous magazine. As it was, I couldn't cut it as a stagehand and the website I had been writing for didn't pay much. Luckily I was making enough to cover my rent and then some. \n\nHere's my scam: For 5 bucks I'll guess your exact age, middle name, and place of birth - the kind of stuff you don't usually advertise on social media. If I guess wrong, you get your money back. Only I'm never wrong, because I'm not guessing. \n\nThere was a small crowd of about a dozen people gathered around me on the sidewalk, not bad for a Tuesday afternoon. A kid and his father stepped towards my jar, the boy dropped in a bill. \n\n\"Hmmm,\" I mused scratching my chin. \"You're 4 and a half. You're middle name is... Nathaniel, and you're from Syracuse!\" I winked at him as he turned to look up at his dad with a smile on his face. \n\nWhen I was in the 7th grade, I attempted to climb a radio tower on a dare. It was January, and I didn't make it very far before I slipped and fell off. I woke up to my friend Collin standing over me, and just above his head I could see his full name, age, and place of birth. I blinked, rubbed my eyes, shook my head, but the floating letters and numbers wouldn't go away. I thought that I was concussed, and so did Collin when I told him. I was. \n\nAnd though concussion eventually went away, the floating ID tags never did. I thought that they couldn't be real at first, that I was just imagining things. But the information was always correct, whether I was looking at a close friend or a perfect stranger. Following my psychologist's advice I ignored it for most of my life, until college when I realized that I could use my skill to make a few bucks and impress girls at parties. People loved to guess how I did it, and I loved to hear their theories. \n\nAs the father and son made their way down the street, my next volunteer dropped their money into my jar. I stole a glance and closed my eyes. \n\n\"Hmmmm... let's see. You're 41. Your middle-\" I opened my eyes to see a man pushing his way through my audience, knocking over a teenager who had been obliviously wrapped up in his phone. I instinctually looked up to see who this jerk was and saw something that made me go cold. \n\nThe man barreling through my crowd was 1841 years old, with a name that I couldn't pronounce. I tried to yell after him, but the words were stuck in my throat. Just then, a man in a black suit appeared, hot on his trail, deftly weaving through the people on the sidewalk. My eyes darted over to read the ID of the man in the suit, and to my disbelief I saw... nothing. \n\nSomething felt wrong. I turned to my left, back towards the man running frantically down the street. He was looking over his shoulder at his pursuer, who was quickly closing in on him. A look of desperation flashed across his face. \n\nI looked on helplessly as he shoved the father of the boy who had just left my act, into the busy New York street. The car that hit him had no time to react as he slammed into the windshield. They hit their breaks and the man rolled onto the pavement, dead. \n\nThe man in the black suit abruptly stopped and turned to move towards the body in the street. The crowd around me exploded in gasps and screams as they rushed to his side. For a moment I was frozen. I watched the murderer round the corner and disappear. I looked back to the man in the black suit, kneeling over the body of the boy's father. He shook his head and then proceeded to do something odd. \n\nHe placed his hand above the face of the deceased and muttered something. An instant later a bright flash emanated from his palm. He stood up and walked back onto the sidewalk, pulled a small book from his jacket and began to scribble something down. \n\nThe people who rushed to help seemed not even to notice the man in the suit. An older couple were attempting to comfort the child. Several people were calling for help on their phones. A few huddled over the man in the street. \n\nNervously, I approached the man in the suit. When I was standing directly in front of him, he looked up at me with an eyebrow raised. He quickly looked behind himself and then back to me. Our eyes met.\n\n\"I don't believe you're on the schedule for today.\" He said, sounding a bit confused. \n\n\"What?\" I asked. \"What's going on here? Who was that man you were chasing and who are you?\" He looked past me, to my sidewalk sign. \n\n\"Samuel, is it?\" He said, smugly. \"It seems like you've got a knack for knowing who people are, so you tell me.\" \n\nI didn't know what I should tell him. As a rule I never tell people my secret. Talking about my ability never goes over very well and nobody ever believes me, but I was unsettled by the events of the past few minutes and I was about to make an exception. \n\n\"I know that the man you were chasing was 1841 years old.\" The man in the suit went wide eyed at hearing this. \"He had a name that I couldn't pronounce, but you...\"\n\n\"But me?\" He said with a smirk. \n\n\"I can't... I don't know who you are, and that's unusual for me\"\n\n\"Interesting.\" He said. He turned and started walking down the alley behind him. \"Follow me, please.\"\n\nI hesitated, but I had to know the truth. I needed to hear what he had to say. I followed him about halfway down the alley before he stopped and turned to face me. \n\n\"Tell me how you knew that the man I chased was so old.\" He said. Something in his voice gave me the chills, and I started to question if following him into this alley was a mistake. \n\n\"I saw his age.\" I said, nervously. \"And his name. I can see these things when I look at someone, their information... is always just sort of floating above them.\" \n\nHe nodded, making another note in his book. \n\n\"Can you see anything else about them?\" He asked. \n\n\"Yeah, I can see where they were born too, but that's it.\" He seemed relieved to hear that. \n\n\"Well Sam, I've never met a mortal with this particular gift of sight before. You'd do well not to attract so much attention to yourself. As to the man I was chasing, you should stay as far away from him as possible. Give me your phone.\" He said as he reached his hand out. \n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Sam, if you see that man again I want you to call me. He is very dangerous.\"\n\n\"Clearly.\" I said, handing him my phone. \"But who are you and what do you want with him? What is he, like a vampire or something?\" \n\n\"A vampire? No, it's the middle of the day and they haven't surfaced in ages.\" He said, with an ounce of ridicule in his voice. \"That man is a thief, and a murder. Nothing more.\" \n\nHe handed me my phone back. \n\n\"If you do see him again, you should call me at once.\" \n\nA voice called from down the alley, \"Sir, we would like to take a statement from you. Can you come talk to us for a minute?\" It was a police officer. \n\n\"Yes, ma'am. Just a moment.\" I shouted. When I turned around, the man in the suit had disappeared. I looked down at my phone to see what he had entered.\n\n\"Death\"\n\n",

            "comment": "You find out some interesting things as a bartender.\n\nMy bar isn't a big bar or a hotspot for college so we don't really need bouncers, my partner, Frank is intimidating enough to keep riffraff from starting. He never understood how I can spot even the most crafty of fakes though.\n\nTruth is, I don't. I can see people's names and ages above their head like it's written on a post card. Funny thing about names though, my power sees people's nicknames, so I don't rely on that, not to mention it weird people out when I mention their names without knowing them. Though that does help me catch fakers.\n\nYou see, while there isn't a college nearby, there is Korean town, and Korea has an interesting way of determining age. When they are born, they are already 1 year old and then upon their new year, they reach 2 years old, so if someone was born the day before, upon New year they would be 2 years legally without living a fill 24 hours.\n\nBecause of this, I always check IDs of those my power seems underaged by about 2 years. If their surname matches and they look Korean, and the ID looks like them, and isn't obviously fake, then I let them drink. It can be difficult considering I see age in days, but I know the amount of days it takes to be that old, give or take leap years into account. \n\nLike I said, you learn some interesting things as a bartender.\n\n_______\n\nOne day, an older fellow, looked about 40-50, dressed dapperly, walked in. I blinked when I saw his age. *This gentleman has lived over 8 million days?* I thought to myself. *Thats about 22 thousand years!*\n\n\"H-how can I help you s-sir,\" I asked taken aback.\n\nFrank looked at me knowing something was up, but I tapped the table telling him to act cool. This is usually the code for undercover cop. \n\n\"Ah yes good chap, I would like your finest draft. Do you brew it here yourself?\" The gentleman inquired. Thomas was his known name, but his family name isn't in any language used by humans, it looked like a pair of angelic wings.\n\n\"No,\" I sighed, \"the nearest brewery supplies us with several kegs a week though, would you like a pint or a pitcher?\" \n\n\"Just a pint for me, thank you.\"\n\n\"No problem, I just need to see your ID.\"\n\n\"Well surely you don't think I'm underaged,\" Thomas said chuckling into his well trimmed mustache. He gets it out and shows it to me.\n\n\"Well you can never be too certain, especially with the drinking laws getting stricter this year.\" I reply with just as much heartiness in my voice. \"One pint coming up\"\n\nI poor the beer and engage in conversation with him. About the time the factory workers get off and start filling in he bids adieu and leaves after tipping his bowler hat. He left a generous tip, $500 was left for a bill of $25. \n\n___\n\nOver the next year he became a weekly regular, but always dodged personal questions. He was quite inquisitive about how I was able to spot fakes as well, though it only came up thrice while he was their. Most kids try it when we're busy thinking I will slip up. \n\nTowards the end of the year I find out I have stage 4 cancer. I only have a month left to live and I frequent the bar less and less each week, leaving it to Frank to handle it. Then I am hospitalized and Frank closes early one day to come see me, and Thomas was there with him. As I'm on my death bed, Frank says his goodbye, he is a stoic individual, but I know he will miss me. I don't have a family so I leave it all to Frank. I turn to Thomas and he speaks in an ancient language, yet I understand it. \n\n\"Hello my Lord,\" Thomas speaks, \" it is nice to see you again.\"\n\n\"That it is old friend, is my time hear up for the century?\" I inquire.\n\n\"Yes, did you find Humanity worth sparing for another hundred years?\" He asks taking anmore serious tone.\n\n\"Yes, even though they have killed so many of themselves, again, I still love them as my creation.\" I reply.\n\nThose were my last words, until another hundred years pass, I will remain in heaven doing my duty, then I will live again on Earth to make sure humans are still worth saving.

He then said something in an unfamiliar accent, that didn't manage to break through the general hum of the crowd. I finally moved my head. 7219. I squinted and, still staring at the monoliths aligned above his head, I said, \"Seventy-two? What are you doing here?\" He didn't look seventy. His eyebrows twitched up, and then he put a shit-eating grin on his face. That unfamiliar accent, his expression and the situation grew unconsciously on my nerves. 7219. I grabbed his sleeve and pulled him closer, expecting the seventy-two to part from a nineteen behind him. It didn't.

You don't have to be big, but it helps, you don't have to be a cunt, it doesn't help.\n\nI worked at one of the largest but dingiest nightclubs in the city called St Saviours, formerly a church as are a lot of clubs here, on a street abutted by many other establishments, mostly trouble free.\n\nBeing in a city, out of the way, remote and a bit backwards has its perks, there are things you can do which I won't mention here.  Being backwards also means that there is a lax attitude towards underagers in the clubs.\n\nMost of the guys you worked with were good guys and you knew they would have your back if shit went down but some were cunts and aggravated situations, making them more dangerous than needed.  We all took advantage of our positions in some way, some stole, some got the girls, I however, looked constantly for cash dropped on the floor - easily bringing in an extra 70 quid each night, I wish i'd have saved it instead of buying weed.\n\nI was working the main floor between site patrols, I was a floater usually, it was the only exercise I got in a day, the sickly smell of the old booze emanating from the floor after the smoking ban(a great thing by the way), the thumping of the bass as they played some crappy r &amp; b, the slutty girls and drugged up guys, bliss.\n\nWhen I was twenty there was a disaster near the city which resulted in radiation exposure for many of the workers, some had died, some were dying and some had mutated DNA, some were crazy and some all of the former.  It was being bitten by someone with mutated DNA during one of the regular bouts of violence in the club that allowed me to be more effective at spotting underage folk than all the others, I was lucky though, I never got punched in all of my eight years.\n\nIt was the end of Summer and Scotland were playing the Netherlands, the club had opened early to allow them in, the rowdy crowd of both fans were getting on famously, I was positioned at the front gate with my mate Marcel controlling the queue.  One after another, people came in, people were refused for being drunk and some were refused because the number above their head(the result of being bitten by the disaster survivor) said they were under 18.\n\nThings were going well, there had been one or two pints thrown at the projection screen but nothing too serious, friendly and jovial, completely the opposite of a bloody Rangers and Celtic match.  One by one he crowd came, one by one they were let in or refused, one couple came up and there was something odd about them, very odd.\n\nThey each had a number but there was no space, the number said 1819, they were Siamese twins",

            "comment": "My boss was the one person I had made knowledgeable of my ability, I mean it looks good on a resume, especially when you're trying to get into the mafia. He had placed me in a starting position as a bouncer, for a night club he ran, that was of course, also a hot spot for some of the most lavish drug deals in Las Vegas.  \n\n\nAs the night began, the usuals started to show up, well-dressed people that had enough money to evade their families for drug binging nights once in a while, or those with their continual habits they managed to keep secret, stopping by for their weekly or monthly stock.  \n\n\nAs midnight hit there was an influx of young kids just past 21, some not even. Those guys were the fun ones, kids with tediously made fake IDs that had never been caught using them, like a deer in headlights, or sometimes throwing a fit like an angry toddler. Made the night more interesting.  \n\n\nAs the party reached it's peak, my favorite family showed up. The Vasiliev's, a kind family of Russian billionaires, with more money than our organization could ever hope to see. I waved at them as they approached from their car, holding the door to the club wide open.  \n\n\n\"Hey, hold on a minute,\" I heard the other bouncer whom I was working with mutter, \"can I see your ID?\" He asked louder as he put his hand out to the young girl that was hanging on the shoulder of Valentin, the Vasiliev's only son. I had not noticed her before.  \n\n\nAs she detached from Valentin's arm to face my fellow bouncer and hand him her ID, I was able to clearly see her number. My jaw visibly dropped as I realized what I was seeing *-5138*.  \n\n\nThe girl looked over her shoulder and straight into my eyes for a moment, as if she too had realized what I just saw. Her violet eyes seemed to penetrate my skin.  \n\n\nJust as quickly as the moment had happened, she had snatched her ID back with a short, \"thank you,\" and was off into the club with the Vasiliev's.  \n\n\n\"Are you okay man?\" My partner asked. \"You look like you've seen a ghost.\"  \n\n\nDisclaimer: First ever comment to this Reddit page aaayyy, sorry if it's odd, not much of a writer, but I'll finish it later, thanks for the awesome writing prompt!",

            "comment": "*first story on wp, eeeeee i'm noivous thank you for the awesome prompt and for letting me share!*  \nAnyways.  \nIt\u2019s alright, really.  Bouncing is not a bad job most nights.  People mostly get funny when they\u2019re drunk.  And for the most part, in this small town, everyone\u2019s pretty good to me.  Every now and then there are machismo shitheads who start going off about \u201cdisrespect.\u201d  But that\u2019s everywhere.  I get free drinks, I get 6% of the tips, my boss spots me money when I\u2019m short.  Most of the night, I\u2019m sitting outside in the cool night air, smoking rollies under the neon lights and just shooting the shit with folks.  It\u2019s okay.  \n\tI\u2019ve worked here for years.  I started at Metronome when I was 28.  I don\u2019t know, it just made sense.  Ever since I was a kid, whenever I looked at someone, really looked into their eyes, I could see their age pop up above their head.  Just briefly.  Just a little soap bubble number that would dissipate just as quickly as it had come.   I\u2019m not sure where it came from.  I don\u2019t mention it.  Maybe it\u2019s hereditary and my dad can do it too, maybe my brother can.  They never brought it up.  So I never brought it up.   But it makes me a fucking great bouncer.  \n\tThere\u2019s all kinds of kids that try to come into the bar.  The nervous ones who I really don\u2019t even need to know their age to know they\u2019re lying \u2013 all shifty and fidgety and avoiding eye contact.  Red faced and sweating.  They look like they want to cry when I tell them that I know their ID is fake.  There are the bros who are all chest and white teeth, who try to walk right past me and get pissed when I stop them.  They say \u201cfuck this place, bro\u201d to their bro buddies when I tell them that I know their ID is fake.  They call me a faggot and then try again in a couple of weeks.  The kids who crack up and don\u2019t even try to make excuses when I tell them that I know their ID is fake.  The girls that are already hammered and try to show me their tits when I tell them that I know their ID is fake.  It\u2019s all little 17\u2019s and 20\u2019s and 18\u2019s that glimmer for a moment over disappointed faces.   \n\tAnyways.  \n\tThere\u2019s a college about 20 minutes down the road from here.  It\u2019s to be expected.  Mostly on the weekends.  On the weekdays, it\u2019s mostly the same sad family of late 50 somethings who are all definitely depressed and all definitely alcoholics and the crowd of late 20 somethings who are all definitely not depressed and all definitely not alcoholics.  Mondays are half off well-whiskey.  Thursdays are 2 dollar shot nights.  \n\tLast night was Tuesday.  It was slow all night.  I had only two rolling papers left.  The door leading into Metronome was closed because there\u2019s a jukebox in the corner that people can buy credits on their phone for, and three girls had control over it and no fucking way.  It was 56 degrees.  \n\tFour more people came to Metronome before midnight.  Two regulars, Richard (56 \u2013 do not ask him about politics Jesus Christ), and Michelle (34, ruins the punch line of jokes, loudly exclaims \u201cwoo\u201d when drunk) and two guys (26, 29) I did not know, who appeared to be on a bashful, but sweet blind date.  One of the guys (26) came out to smoke for a couple of minutes and asked if I thought his date was out of his league physically.  I said I didn\u2019t really get a good look, but that shouldn\u2019t matter too much if he liked him.  Rallied, he finished his cigarette and the two guys left together shortly after.  \n\tAnyways.  \n\tAround midnight, a skinny, scruffy guy with messy brown hair and a threadbare sweater approached, digging around in his pocket for his wallet.  He couldn\u2019t get his ID out for a moment, and said \u201csorry man,\u201d before handing it to me.  \n\tOpie Daniels, 36, brown eyes, 150 pounds.  I looked in his eyes and glanced to the number above his head.  \n\t3845.  \n\tIt took me a long moment to realize what I\u2019d seen.  I handed Opie Daniels back his ID, told him thank you and thought about rolling one of my remaining cigarettes.  \n\tAnd then for a moment I couldn\u2019t breathe.  I felt a tight clenching in my stomach and for whatever reason, a cool feeling of dread steeping deeply in the pit of my lungs.  38.  I had seen the number 38.  It was all good.  \n\tBut was it?  My head was buzzing and I couldn\u2019t seem to roll my tobacco up and shaking my head couldn\u2019t seem to clear the weird, growing pressure in my ears.  \n\tI pushed open Metronome\u2019s door, crossing the floor, letting myself behind the bar.  My hands blindly groped for a beer bottle, as I looked over the bar and as I cranked off the metal top, I found Opie Daniels, sitting alone hunched over a can of PBR, sort of watching the wrestling that was on TV, sort of playing on his phone.  He took a slow, intentional drink and his dark, deep-set eyes swung round to meet mine.  \n\t3845.  \n\tHe met my gaze steadily, evenly, neutrally.  There was no defiance in his eyes.  No aim to fight.  No deep wisdom.  He looked normal.  \n\tI didn\u2019t know what to do.  I took my beer and I went back outside.  \n\tIt crossed my mind faintly that I was broken.  That I was losing the one ability that had so pervasively helped me as a bouncer.  If that was true, I was fucked.  I was shit at telling fake ID\u2019s from real ID\u2019s.  \n\tThe beer felt cold and metallic and heavy on my tongue, in my throat, but about halfway through, my brain started to settle.  It became easier - or perhaps necessary - to focus on anything else.  \n\tMichelle (34) left a little while later, giving me a sloppy hug.  She told me to watch out for these fools.  I didn\u2019t know who these fools were supposed to be, but I told her I would.  \n\tAnyways.  \n\tOpie Daniels left at 1:45 a.m.  Metronome was going to close in fifteen minutes.  Not quite last call.  Outside the door, he pulled out a pack of American Spirits, yellow.   He smacked them hard against the palm of his hand.  He saw me watching him and tipped his chin at me.  \n\t3845.  \n\tThere it was. Thirty-eight hundred.  He looked so normal.  He looked mid-thirties.  Maybe a couple years older than me.  There was no way.  \n\tOpie Daniels lit one of his cigarettes and pulled in a deep drag, deep down into his lungs.  He let out tendrils of smokes, slowly, deliberately.  Like he was letting himself finally settle into a slow, still moment.  Then he pocketed his cigarettes and started away.  \n\t\u201cI know your ID is fake.\u201d  \n\tIt didn\u2019t even sound like my voice.  It was higher, more quavering, almost a whisper.  There was a sudden ringing stillness in my body as Opie Daniels stopped, his back towards me.  \n\tWhen he turned around, he was smiling wide, a giant, mischievous, open-mouthed grin.  He was missing two teeth on his upper right side.  \n\t\u201cYou probably have to call the cops on me, heh.\u201d  A throaty, rasping laugh.  \u201cOr do you think I\u2019m old enough?\u201d  \n\tI didn\u2019t answer.  I didn\u2019t know how.  I felt like I didn\u2019t know how to speak anymore.  I clenched and unclenched my hands manically at my sides.  \n\tOpie Daniels took a step back towards me, still smiling.  He was taller than me.  He took another drag on his cigarette, gaze locked on mine.  There was an eerie glint in his eyes, something that spoke of something deep down and dark.  Something that belied the smile on his face.  \n\tNever have I felt so cold.  \n\tHe took another step closer to me.  Close enough to smell the stale sweetness of old cigarette smoke.  Something earthy and red.  Something carnal and sharp and tinged with metal and iron.  Something bad.  \n\tHis eyes were dark, sunken and I couldn\u2019t look away.  He reached up with the hand not holding his cigarette and grabbed my lower lip hard, pulling it out away from my face, digging his nails into the flesh of my lips.  \n\tAnd when he touched me, the air exploded, my blood screamed, everything broke.  \nBlurrily, I saw him close his eyes and took a long, purposive inhale of my face, in through his nose, his nostrils quivering.  \n\tWhen he exhaled, I swear he made a noise of pleasure, a low, scraping noise that sounded like, \u201cmmm.\u201d  \n\tHe released my lip, studied my face for a moment, gave me a wink and said, \u201cdon\u2019t work too hard.\u201d  \n\tAnd then Opie Daniels turned, took another drag from his cigarette, hiked up his pants and walked away.  I never saw him again.  \n\tIt took me a long time to move.  To even realize I was shivering. Hard.  My teeth were chattering.  I don\u2019t know what time I left the bar.  I don\u2019t know when I got home.  I don\u2019t know how I got home.  I took a shower.  I scrubbed my face until my mouth bled.  \n\tI will never, ever talk about what I saw when Opie Daniels grabbed my lip.  \n\tThe next day, Wednesday, I watched sitcom reruns.  I went to the grocery store and bought rice.  I went to work and clocked in at Metronome and moved through all the motions of my day.  People\u2019s ages popped above their heads just like normal (27, 30, 65, 42\u2026), and I checked ID\u2019s just like normal.  \n\tI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ok.  I don\u2019t know.  \n\tAnyways.",

            "comment": "He watched, bored as people streamed in the bar, only stopping the ones underage, and occasionally a few just over to keep suspicions low. His kind was uncommon, and people\nhunted for his power. It seemed like an odd thing to want, most just wanted it to make them feel *special*. At least, those that knew about it. Sometimes age didn't match up to looks, but he kept to his own, unless they were underage of course. But then *she* came along. As soon as the girl passed, his eyes flickered to the space above, knowing what he would see. The girl was likely 16, or 17, as was the guy with her. But she wasn't. 1000 was her age, the one with her was 1001. This wasn't possible, but yet, that's what it said. Maybe it was wrong? But he'd NEVER been wrong before. As they passed he realized his mouth had been hanging open and he shut it reluctantly. A tap on his shoulder made him jump, but it was only the guy taking over next shift. Perfect. Making his way through the crowd he saw the girl heading into a storage room with a 18year old, different from whom she came with. He shook his head, about to leave when a silvery glint caught his eye. The boy was nearby, a knife in his hand. The girl disappeared, the other following suit. Breath catching, he hurried over, sure he would be greeted with a bloodbath. The door shut behind him and he looked around. In the darkness he saw the pair fighting the young man, backing him against the wall. \n\n\"Jonathan, will you do the honour?\"\n\nHe laughed in reply and stepped up, twirling a silver bladed dagger in his fingers. He laughed and drove the blade straight through the heart. Black blood flowed from the wound and the boy seemingly folded in on himself, disappearing all except for the puddle of black on the ground.\n\n\"Welcome to the world of the lightbringers, young one. We have long searched for one with a gift like yours, it will be quite useful. That is, if you don't mind joining us. Hunting demons is much better with more people involved, especially with talent like this. Let's get started, shall we?\"",

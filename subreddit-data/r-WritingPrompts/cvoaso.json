            "comment": "We called it humanity's worst disaster. History named it The Great Blinding. What that doesn't entail is that it was our own damn fault. The world was wrought into chaos after several months of warnings and we simply elected to ignore them, feigning assurance - \"Oh that'll go away once we start on it.\" \n\n\"That's no problem for the government. They'll take care of us.\" \n\n\"Don't get involved, you'll just get in the way of the experts.\" \n\nUltimately, no one did anything about it because they thought others were on top of the problem. Indeed, this led to a fading away of layers of ozone that prevented the full wrath of the sun. The ozone wasn't fully gone, no but enough that the light truly lit up the earth. When it was day, we were all doomed. No corner of darkness could hide us. It took mere seconds and we were caught. There were legends of a group of roamers traveling eternally into the night, never letting the day come upon them. It's been 2 years since... The night doesn't last very long. We don't walk by sight anymore. We walk by faith. In faith, we sense the heat. We developed patterns of excursions into the dark. The already blind, we called them Ushers of Darkness, led us. They knew the world unlike us. We fell into line. We worshiped them. They walked the world, took us places with cool air, cold water, taught us to feel the world around us.\n\nThen it happened. Colors poured into my periphery, filling my vision. At first, I was confused. Dreaming? Tripping? Then everything settled in place. The world stood in plain view. I was astonished at what I saw... Scribblings everywhere, didn't matter how far I went, even on the people themselves, myself included - \"Don't tell them you can see.\" Granted, it was all dim since we were hiding in the dark but there was enough.\n\nI wasn't sure what would happen if I did tell them despite the warning so I played along. I saw where the Ushers of Darkness led us. They led us through dangerous places but on safe paths, balancing on a thin rope death and life... I nearly got caught myself veering off the path because of my insatiable curiosity. As time went on, I got better at keeping up the act. It became dreary... I wish I could be blind again. We couldn't do much anyway. We were holed up from the sun's wrath.\n\nThen I started feeling something was off... No one was talking. It was pure silence. Yet we kept doing the same things again and again, our excursions in the dark to scavenge, then back to our darkly caves with oases. But silence. I tried to talk but was afraid I'd slip up and show I could see. After all, what we talk about tend to be what we feel or see. The risks simply weren't worth it. Then I thought a thought...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat if they all could see?",

            "comment": "When The Blinding first occurred, I thought I was the only individual affected. I was sitting at my desk working on a school paper and in an instant, everything went black. \n\nI had cried out to my parents in fear and confusion, but their response was like an echo of my own. They, too, couldn't see. And we soon learned the entire world had been victim to having their sight filled with darkness. Interestingly enough, we don't think this affected any of the animals living on Earth. Just us humans. The only strange thing that occurred after this was the fact that the demand for Milk skyrocketed. \n\nAt first, adapting was extremely difficult. Something as mundane and simple as using the bathroom had become a daily challenge I didn't look forward to.  \n\nWithin a few months, support groups had been created by individuals who were already blind prior to the incident. They assisted those who were struggling with adapting to their newfound obstacle. \n\nThankfully, the world never really stopped moving or progressing. Outside of major adjustments that had to be made, such as devising a different mode of transportation or different requirements and standards in the working world, we managed to pull through.\n\nIt's been about 2 years since The Blinding and there were times where I had forgotten such an event occured. \n\nI was taking a short walk to the store to get some groceries. I don't know why, but I've developed an almost dependency like state on milk. I had gripped the handle to the door to the small grocery store and pushed the door open. A bell was hung on the inside handle of the door.\n\n\"Hello, let me know if you need help finding anything.\" A voice said to my right.\n\n\"Thanks, Dave. I will.\" I responded.\n\n\"Hey John! How've you been?\" he asked with a somewhat enthusiastic tone. \n\nWith a somewhat slow pace I walked around the store, feeling along the brail to determine if I had found my item. \n\n\"Pretty much the same\" I said with a bit of a chuckle. \n\nMy hand touched something cold. Finally. Found the milk.\n\nAs I was about to open the door I could see my reflection in the rectangle shaped window of the cooler. \n\nI wasn't entirely sure how to react nor was I sure as to what happened. I was looking. At myself. In a mirror. For the first time in two years.\n\nI started shaking and I could feel warmth and moisture filling my eyes. \n\nI noticed writing on the reflection itself. I was so excited I hadn't even noticed. In fact, most of the interior was covered in this writing. Looked a little closed at the message written in black.\n\n*Don't tell them you can see.*\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? Who's them?\n\nI then caught a glimpse of the individual standing behind the counter of the store. \n\nWho...what the fuck is that...\n\n\"John? You need some help buddy?\" it asked. It had Dave's voice, but it definitely wasn't Dave. And the way it's mouth moved was...\n\nWait, is that it's mouth? I have no idea.\n\nI was staring at something that was at least 6 feet tall. Grotesque and eldritch was the only way I could describe it. It's dark brown skin was smooth and moist with extremely tiny openings in its skin. It wasn't wearing any type of clothing.   It's arms were somewhat long and thin looking appendages that ended in human looking hands. Its head was shaped like a large Basket Ball. The creatures mouth looked to be in a vertical position and when it spoke I could see many layers and rows of crocodile like teeth.\n\n\"Here John, let me come help.\" It said. Its voice had changed as well. It was gurgled and sounded like it was being put through a filter.\n\n As it moved I could hear it squish against the floor. That's the first time I've ever heard that. Why am I hearing that just now? Why have I never heard that before?\n\nInstead of gaping at the reflection and trying to ascertain how it walks, I simply stared at a jug of milk. \n\nThat's when I noticed the color of the milk. It wasn't white or brown or any color a milk should be. It was dark black.\n\nAs the creature grew closer a foul smell harassed my nostrils. It took everything I had not to vomit.\n\nIt reached out with it's human like appendage and touched my shoulder. \n\nMy entire body tensed up. \n\n\"We're having a lot of different specials on milk today.\" It said and I could see its mouth open wide behind my head with what I assumed was a smile.",

The milk can have numerous explanations but it could keep blindness or serve as a way of preparation of being consumed by this beings. This is proven even more by creature changing it's voice and making noises it couldn't allow before. Therefore, as soon as it knew Jon realised, it just went ahead, crept behind it, smiled, and possibly ate him. Maybe it was it's plan all along.!&lt;",

The \u2018Milk\u2019 definitely has been keeping all humans in this state. \n\nMaybe when the aliens arrived they had the power to zap all sight and manipulate the senses but not the strength to maintain it so they use the liquid to keep the humans spellbound. \n\nMy only complaint/curiosity is why did the milk all of a sudden lose effectiveness on the guy? (Sure I guess you could just say it was the prompt) but in this world the effects should somewhat slowly wear off, either that or anytime anyone goes without the milk for a day or two they instantly get their sight back. \n\n\u2026\n\nWell now that I think about it that could be a cool reason for why the text is on all the walls. \n\nThe milk is addicting and people seek it out daily, and the aliens want to help them get it so it\u2019s always on \u201csale\u201d but small things always happen and in this world when a human accidentally can\u2019t get access to the milk for 24 hours they instantly get their sight back. \n\nAnd the early ones who did would shout! \u201cOh my god I can see!\u201d And those people would disappear. Maybe violently, maybe secretly as to not alarm any blind people nearby. \n\nAfter time this maybe started to worry blind people, they\u2019d hear rumors spreading through their towns about how people suddenly were gaining their sight but then disappearing or winding up dead somehow shortly after. \n\nSo now as the trauma and tension sets in the towns, when more people gain their sight they stop shouting about it and instead panic and keep quiet. They start writing it on the walls to alert any other sighted who may not have had the fortune to hear the rumors they have heard. \n\nAnd that\u2019s how we get to this point in the story. \n\nThe protagonist walks in, regains his sight, and sees the writing on the walls. The creature can sense something is up, by the protagonist not responding. I have a hunch these creature can\u2019t see though. The description involved only a mouth and no eyes. Which would make sense why it doesn\u2019t react to the protagonist acting visually strange. If you can\u2019t see, all you know is what you hear and the protagonist isn\u2019t responding so that\u2019s not a big alarm bell, if he could see him panicking, look into his eyes, he\u2019d know something is wrong. The creature wants to make sure though because he\u2019s suspicious and walks over to him to see if he can hear any tension in his voice, indicating he\u2019s gotten his sight back. \n\nSo depending on the way the character answers would tell the creature everything. If he says \n\n\u201cI..I\u2026uh pl-please. I\u2019m okay. N-never mind\u201d \n\nthe creature would immediately know \u2018yep he can see me\u2019 and drag him away to wherever sighted people go, sighted people who could potentially ruin their secret to the rest of the world and end their secret reign. \n\nBut if the protagonist puts the pieces together quickly enough and is able to calm himself down he would say \u201c\u2026.Yep! I love those sales, and this Milk!\u201d\n\nAnd the creature would believe all is well and check him out and send him on his way.",

            "comment": "Most people lost their sight waking up on the morning of the first day, as the event started in the middle of the night. The change only occurred as one slept, so others attempted to remain awake to retain their vision for longer. This effort proved to be pointless, as the effects took hold the moment they closed their eyes and started to doze. As the days stretched into weeks, Microsleep ended up taking of the vision of the most resilient.\n\nAdjusting to the change was difficult, but there was ease in knowing that everyone was blind, and that we all shared the same struggle. Those that were blind *before* the change became valuable assets to their communities. They found themselves teaching thousands, in neighborhoods where there were no blind people before.\n\nI spent my time at home, with my animals, listening to old reruns of my favorite TV shows. Years of mental health issues had rendered me unfit to work in the eyes of the state, so many aspects of my life continued as usual. I did miss reading and, although I managed to find a few books in braille, it wasn't that simple to learn. The small dots weren't that clear to me as someone who had recently gone blind. Walking the trails around my house was not an option anymore either.\n\nThat was then, though. Today, something changed that I didn't anticipate would happen. For the first time in over 785 days, I saw something.\n\nThere have been stories since The Great Blinding of people regaining their sight. In all cases so far, it has been attributed to an overactive imagination. I must admit that even I have been fooled into thinking I was seeing something. You catch what looks like a flash of light, but it quickly fades and you are reminded that you are still blind, and that it has been the case for over a year now.\n\nToday was different. I saw the flash of light, but it quickly expanded to cover my entire field of view. I had to remind myself that I had a field of view again. I was amazed at how much I could see again, but startled at how *forward* everything felt. In my blindness, I experienced my world in 360 degrees. Now, I was seeing only what was in front of me, and I noted how unaware I was of this before. My ears were still trained to the world of the blind however, so I found myself more aware of my surroundings than I remembered being before The Great Blinding.\n\nWords started to appear in my vision. At first unfamiliar, but then more clear as the image of what each letter meant reappeared in my minds eye. I had forgotten what letters looked like.\n\n'Do not tell them that you can see' were the words scrawled on my wall. The writing was brown, and it had no stench. I looked around to see if there was evidence that someone entered my room while I slept, but I soon realized that the substance was dried and old. Someone wrote this on my wall a long time ago, and I had no idea why.\n\nI crept out of my room and realized that the sun was starting to set. After so long without sight, I wasn't surprised that my sleep cycle was so off. For me, it felt like early morning.\n\nThe sky was illuminated with streamers of light, and everywhere people wandered through the streets, heading for work. The setting sun turned the sky a rich burgundy striped with its golden rays. There were no stars in this sky. In the distance, the trees danced, casting their long shadows on the surrounding fields. Looking closer, I realized they were actually dancing. Tall branches were swaying with their movements as they spun around one another and held each others' arms.\n\nNearby, the people continued with their lives, unaware of the beings in their midst. Translucent birds flew high in the sky and shattered against the stone clouds only to congeal and reform as a different bird. Their chirps mimicking those of any birds I knew of before The Great Blinding. Orbs of light illuminated and disappeared as they moved through the air, sometimes passing through people, unbeknownst to them.\n\nThere were no roads or vehicles in the street. The asphalt and gravel were replaced with fields of grass; despite this, my feet clattered on the ground as if it were still made of stone. I was so absorbed in my changed surroundings, it was hard to take in. In the distance I heard whispers and, as I narrowed my eyes, I caught sight of a person waving at me to come near. I approached with caution, not knowing who or what they might be.\n\n\"Get in here!\" They pointed at my house. \"Before they notice me.\" I retreated through the door, and faced the man who was invading my home. \"Do you have any idea what you are looking at?\" He spoke quietly, and stared out the window. The red glare of the night sky cast his face in a bloodied shadow. \"You have entered the world of the dead.\u201d He closed the blinds. \u201cYou are witnessing things you were never supposed to see.\u201d\n\n**Edit: Hey!

I'll be honest, my first thought was space aliens of some sort of monsters from a Stygian realm. I was terrified.\n\nI carefully got out my cane and went about my business, often closing my eyes to make the subterfuge more believable.\n\nThen I saw my first glimpse of the truth. We were \"them\". The scant few that could see were chained or harnessed to work for the blind masses.\n\nNot down on the grubby streets where most of us eeked out our living, mind you. There was a military, or industrial wealth class that had quickly seized the few who had never gone blind.\n\nIn the first days of The Great Blinding there had been a few helpful souls that had not succumbed according to the rumors. But the rumors faded when everyone realized the'd never met a sighted person or became unsure of their memories of those first few traumatic days.\n\nOver time it was revealed that a few people took longer to lose their sight.\n\nAnd so many people died in those first weeks that who was to say when someone simply disappeared.\n\nBut now I could glance across distant vistas and through chain link fences at the sighted slaves doing the work only sighted people can do. Tethered and beaten, the slaves, some hobbled by broken or missing feet, could glare defiance, and leave messages that the blind overseers couldn't detect.\n\nThe words were in mismatched paints or organic stains.\n\nThe words were in the margins of the braille paperwork.\n\nThe messages were passed by a one in a thousand moment of eye contact and a nodding head as you pass on the street.\n\nIn the land of the blind the sighted man is not king. He is valuable property.\n\nBut revolution is brewing.",

            "comment": "I stilled dreamed of seeing. \n\nI think that's why I initially snoozed my alarm clock instead of gasping for joy. But as I rolled back over to look at my wife lying next to me, I did gasp. Not for joy, but out of shock. On the wall behind Kathrine a message had been hastily painted on the wall.\n\n\\-DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE-\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Katherine said groggily but alarmed. Her vacant stare reminding me that for the last 2 years I have been blind.\n\nI am unable to respond as the realization of what is happening has not fully dawned on me.\n\n\"Jim?!\" she now sounds more awake and even more concerned. She flails out her arms searching for me and when her hand rest on my shoulder I have regained enough composure to speak.\n\n\"N-nothing.\" I stammer. \"Just had a nightmare.\"\n\nThe tension in her face eases as her hand glides up to my face and leans in for a kiss.\n\n\"you had me worried.\" She sighs. \"Do you want to talk about it?\"\n\n\"No.\" I respond quietly, still trying to get my bearings.\n\nI sit up and look around the room growing more confused and horrified as I do. On every available surface I can see the same message has been painted.\n\n\\-DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE-\n\nThe paint is obviously not new, as it has slightly faded from a bright red, to a more rusted maroon. I also see the guide rod we have been using to navigate the new home we were given a year after the great blinding took place. The room looked very different from how I dreamed of it. It seemed smaller and dust has settled on all the surfaces that were not regularly used. As I took in the first glimpses of the room I have spent the last year in, growing more uneasy as I read the same message over and over, I felt a hand on the small of my back. I gave a startled yelp and nearly jumped out of bed.\n\n\"Must have been a bad one.\" Kathrine giggled from behind me. \"Sure you don't want to talk about it?\"\n\n\"Maybe later.\" I mumbled.\n\nI turned to face her and was overcome with emotion. In 2 years she hasn't changed much. Her chestnut hair was longer than I remembered it and was haphazardly strewn around her. Her soft smile showed a few more smiles lines around the corners of her mouth. The eyes were the biggest difference. They looked glossed over and unfocused, the rich brown covered with a grayish haze. I felt a pang of sadness and guilt wash over me as I stared at those eyes. The mixture of joy and grief became too much and I excused myself to go to the bathroom.\n\nAs I stood up to leave, I finally noticed the dark amorphous shape in the corner and stopped with my breath caught in my throat. It wavered on the edges as if it were pulsing or breathing. It seemed to be pulling in the light around it further obscuring it from my sight. I reached out to steady myself on the guide rod and as I did, the shaped slithered into the bathroom.\n\n\"Hurry up,\" Kathrine complained, \"I need to go too.\"",

One day the world was a colorful pastel full of life and movement and the next day we were blind. Not just some of us. Everybody was blind. Color became something that *was* instead of something that *is*. I could pick up an apple and not know if it was red or green or yellow or maybe it was just something made to feel like an apple. For a time I would talk about the delicate red feathers of a cardinal I could hear chirping outside my bedroom window. Soon it was just a cardinal, and finally it was just a bird. We lost color, and with the color left a little part of us. \n\nI felt the life trickle out of me the longer I was enveloped in darkness. Walks at the park were monotonous now, meaningless as the darkness there was as dark as the darkness anywhere else. I could feel the leaves; the little veins that coursed up from the stem and the ridges and edges of the bark of a tree. I could hear the splash of water when I tossed a rock into the pond but I could no longer see the ripples of the water or the ducks scurrying away. I knew there should be a meaning to all this, some entity encouraging me to learn to utilize my other senses or to appreciate the sounds of the world, but all I could think of was how beautiful it all used to be. \n\nIt has been two years since the Blinding. Two years of darkness. Two years of indoctrination. Verbal illumination, as they called it. We were told what we would see if we could see. We were told how it should look and what it should mean and why things were never quite the way we thought they were. It has been two years since the Blinding, and it has been two hours since I opened my eyes and things were different again.\n\nMy world was no longer black when I awoke, suddenly a long unfamiliar contrast between my eyes being open and my eyes being closed. It was offputting but relieving; terrifying but intriguing. There was color again. Not the beautiful oranges and reds and greens of autumn leaves, but at least there was more than just darkness. \n\nThe walls were grey and the world was foggy. Shapes turned to letters as I read the words scrawled on my bedroom walls. \"Don't tell them you can see,\" I deciphered, barely construing the different shades of grey that outlined the words. So I didn't. The paranoia overtook me as I hid my vision from whatever power had rendered me blind. I did my best to play it off, to not look at the little grey bird perched on my windowsill and to hide my excitement from my colleagues. I went about my day as I would a blind man, using my hands like feelers as I groped and grasped my way about.\n\nI tapped away at the keyboard on my desk, the lifeless machine reciting back to me my keystrokes and any information it considered relevant to my role. The firm had adopted seamlessly to the Blinding, installing backup measures as if they had been preparing them for years. I peaked. It was the same monotony it had always been.\n\nIn the bathroom I saw the words again, etched into the mirror they hadn't bothered to remove. Why would they, after all? We were all blind and mired in the misery of endless introspection. Mirror or no mirror, it made no difference. Everything was grey; the colors no more diverse than light grey and grey and dark grey. But there were those words again, \"Don't tell them you can see.\" I just stood there, looking at myself. My clothes were grey and my face was grey and my eyes that had once been the faintest shade of blue were grey and lifeless as the darkness we were supposed to be in.\n\nI shook my head. I fought back the sadness. I had assumed until now that color still was; if the darkness ever ended, the birds I heard would still be yellow and blue and red and the plants would still have green leaves and purple flowers. Instead they were all grey. I told myself that it was my vision, not that somebody had removed the colors themselves from our beautiful world. I found comfort in convincing myself that my vision was still impaired. The alternative was far worse.\n\nOutside the office, the street was grey and the sky was grey and the buildings that stretched towards that grey sky blended into the clouds just a slightly different shade of grey. But as I looked out, a flash of color caught my eye. A man stood in the shadows of a building, looking out at me from an alleyway as grey as everything else. His shirt was red and his pants were blue and even from this distance I could see the pink of his skin. It dawned on me that if he had color then the birds really were grey and my curiosity struggled to overcome the overwhelming sadness I felt. He stared, and when I finally met his eyes he waved me towards him and disappeared into the alley.\n\n*****\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cvstw8/the_great_blinding_part_2/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cw5hjc/the_great_blinding_part_3/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cx4djl/the_great_blinding_part_4/)\n\n*****\n\nThanks for reading!

Like the others, I had been blinded December before last.  My MX-Sarah assistant had guided me back home while the world was in chaos.  The robot became my eyes.  \n\nI needed an upgrade but Patriot Pay was stalled.  We were the lucky ones.  The ones with skill sets that didn't need our eyes.  United States Occupational Relief picked us up.\n\nThere was an uprising, if you can call it that.  Blind masses screamed in the street for something to be done.  Screamed for answers.  For a cure.  But the doctors had been blinded too.\n\nThe e-security cleaned everything up very quickly.  It was rumored they retrained you in the camps for an occupation you could do without your sight.  I liked to believe it.  The more plausible rumors aren't vey nice.  \n\nOfficial broadcasting never made mention of the camps.  They were something not to be acknowledged.  Like the blocks of empty houses.  Something to be forgotten.\n\nDON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE\n\nAfter two years, letters become shapes before words.  When the message finally hit, I closed my eyes reflexively.  My heart started racing.  I had a new secret to keep.\n\n*Marcus, is everything all right?*\n\nMX-Sarah's grating, chipper tone stabbed the air.  I rubbed my eyes and replied \"I think it must be a bit dusty, that's all\".  I opened my eyes and willed them out of focus.  \n\n*You would like me to dust.  Is that correct?*\n\nA sickening wave self-consciousness hit.\n\n\"Yes.  Sarah.  Schedule dusting today.  1500.\"\n\n*Dusting scheduled today at 3pm.  To cancel, say CANCEL*\n\nThen there was silence.  I was trying to remember what I did with my body.  My eyes. \n\nBe normal.  Be normal.\n\nDON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE\n\nNote:  Have to go now.  If someone is interested in finishing this, I'm thinking over-population for post global warming scarce resources caused a global oligarchy to take dramatic action.  Artificial intelligence has made human workers all but unnecessary.  Mass blinding was a way to exterminate a large portion of the population.  Mass disinformation campaigns / desire to keep people in their place.  Hence, DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE\n\nThinking there is are \"The Visionaries\" that paint the letters, subverting the rulers.  I'm imagining secret transport network + a final boss scene, ambushing the ruling class.  The blindness is caused by an issued chemical.  Just need to avoid exposure.  Some accidentally are \"cured\" because they have accidentally avoided the blindness dose for long enough.\n\nThanks for the great prompt OP!",

MX-Sarah blessedly crashed after the 78th movie I asked her to download and Visio-Talk. There's something to be said for never upgrading.  Grabbed an old cane and banged down the hallway.  It was extremely easy to act blind now.  \n\nOut on the street, the act became much more difficult.  A man with a full suit jacket and tie but no pants passed me, dick swinging in the morning light.  People wore a hodgepodge of athletic clothing, pajamas and general inappropriate nudity.  I counted a dozen sets of nipples before realizing that most women had long abandoned their bras.  Thankfully, Mr. Suit was in the minority - I was not subjected to another raw Johnson for several blocks.\n\nI was chuckling to myself when I saw a bloke in neon, with bold 2D barcodes down his shirt.  Once I saw one, I couldn't under them.  They wore headsets, no canes, with expensive augmentation on their shins and forearms.  One seemed to stare right at me with his milky eyes,  looking through me, beyond me.\n\nSuddenly the muggy August air seemed cold.  I tapped, tapped, tapped by more red text.\n\nTHOSE WITH VISION FIGHT FOR FREEDOM\n\nStenciled right beside it was a crooked \n\nDON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE\n\nWith new trepidation, I tapped my cane down Broadway and made my way into the office.  Everyone's life was shit these days.  Mine was better than most.  I didn't need this.\n\nSwipping my chip, the doors opened and I was inside.  I tapped, tapped to the elevator.  The cleanliness of my floor was shocking.  Unlike my apartment building, it was well lite.  There were orchids on the receptionist's desk.  Beyond it, crystal blue eyes locked with mine.  A yound woman slowly shook her head and resumed staring into space.  Her quiet typing set me back.\n\nI tapped, tapped, tapped to my desk.  I knew this walk by heart now.  Another chip scan unlocked my computer and I set to work on the Braille keyboard.  We had no screens, only keyboards.  The clicking of the keys helped lull me back to the lifeless state.\n\nSuddenly a paper was slammed across my desk.\n\nIn now familiar block letter were printed:\n\nONLY THE PARANOID SURVIVE\n\nI kept typing, feigning ignorance and blindness.  I kept typing as the paper fell to the floor.  The scent of lilac hung in the air.",

We all worked 13 hours now.  \n\nIt was the first sunset I'd seen in years and it was beginning to look like it would be my last.  Fuck it.  I raised my head up and took in the all the color, the clouds, nature's fleeting drama.  \n\n\"Marcus.  What are you waiting for, a blow job?  Come with me.  Have a drink.

His silhouette jerked over to a corner.  \n\nIt's very bad manners to leave a blind man without telling him.  Many people go full minutes before noticing they are alone, talking to themselves.  Perhaps there's a reason this sort gets abandoned but still.  Rude.\n\nBut I wasn't blind and my new companion clearly knew it.  I tapped over and took the chair next to him.\n\n\"You must be in 27b/6\"\n\nHow did he know my apartment?\n\n\"Fuck that hot box.  You know I complained about the HVAC for months.

            "comment": "It returned as quickly as it was taken away. I wasn\u2019t prepared for it, and now rather than being blinded by darkness, I was blinded by bright light. I stumbled backwards and fell to my knees, my hands gripping the brick wall behind me. I closed my tearing eyes and blinked slowly, trying to get readjusted to the light.\n\nTwo years ago The Darkness came. I had been cutting tomatoes for my wife, Jane, who was saut\u00e9ing vegetables when the world went black. I cried out, blinking furiously, my hands clawing at my face. I heard a similar cry behind me.\n\n\u201cBen, Ben, I can\u2019t see! Somethings wrong, I can\u2019t see!\u201d\n\n\u201cJane, I can\u2019t either. We need to call for help, something happened.\u201d\n\nI groped around for the phone. I didn\u2019t even know where it was, but I needed to keep my hands busy. It had to be on the counter somewhere. And that\u2019s when I heard Jane scream.\n\nShe must have burned herself on the frying pan, or knocked it over, but her shrieks still haunt me to this day. When I did find a phone, I couldn\u2019t get an ambulance, we couldn\u2019t even contact the police. A busy line greeted us.\n\nThis didn\u2019t just happen to us. It happened to everyone. And with the world\u2019s sight being gone, for some reason sounds we had grown accustom to went away as well. The busy New York City streets were now quiet, the happy chatter that filled the park across from us was silent. We now lived in a blind and muted world.\n\nWe treated Jane\u2019s burns with ice and carried through the motions of our old life. Before the TV stations went dark, they would bring on people who had suddenly went blind before The Darkness. They said that it was something that they got used to and eventually they learned how to continue living on with their lives. But either they were lying or had a support system that we couldn\u2019t get because life for us was terrible.\n\nWe ran out of food within a month and began making trips to a near by bodega to pick up whatever we could. When we arrived, people were fighting over the last few frozen meals. We got what we could, but I left with a bruised face and Jane\u2019s arm was cut by a knife.\n\nWe began venturing further from home to find the things we needed to survive, but a year ago, we got lost and we haven\u2019t been able to find out way back home. We sleep when we find a soft place, we eat when we find food, and we barely survive.\n\nBut now\u2026 I blinked and there was an outline. I blinked again and there was now faded color. I blinked a third time and saw my wife, hunched over, picking out her ragged hair, and staring at nothing.\n\n\u201cJane,\u201d I said, my eyes still tearing from the sting of the sun, but unwilling to blink again at fear that it would all go away. I stared at her. Her skin was gray and scarred with burns and cuts, her clothes filthy, her bones prominent, and nails long and broken.\n\n\u201cJane!\u201d I said, more loudly this time. She rose her head slowly, her blue eyes looking to the left of me. My voice cracked, I rarely spoke above a whisper in the past few months. There was no need to.\n\n\u201cI think I can\u2026\u201d I trailed off, barely believing it, convinced it was an illusion or a cruel trick. \u201cI think I can\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd then something caught my eye. The building behind my haggard wife. Thick black letters formed a sentence. It took me a little time before I understood what it meant as reading had been a lost luxury for us.\n\nDON\u2019T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE!\n\nThat\u2019s when I began to look around. It wasn\u2019t just on that one wall, it was everywhere, big and small. Like a crazed graffiti artist had made the city his own but only had one thing to say.\n\nWhose \u201cthem\u201d? I look at the people around me. We were in an alley way accompanied by three other people. A man who looked like he was about to begin urinating and sang softly to himself, a woman napping on a piece of cardboard, and a second man talking softly to the wall.\n\nMy story wasn\u2019t unique. I had heard many similar ones over the past two years; people who couldn\u2019t find their families, others like us who couldn\u2019t find their way home. Some who had gone days without food. There were fights, rapes, theft, murder, and so many horrible things we never thought would happen in our city.\n\nThe world had become lawless. And we were trying to not become its victims.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d Jane whispered, her head bobbed up to face mine, guided by my voice.\n\n\u201cI think I can\u2026\u201d I looked back at the thick black warning surrounding me and back at my wife. Whoever had written them must have been as crazed as the man who had now begun peeing to the right of me as he sang the alphabet backwards.\n\n\u201cI think I can see.\u201d\n\nI thought the world had gone quiet when The Darkness began, but in the moment I knew what true silence was. The peeing man stopped urinating and singing, the napping woman stopped snoring, and muttering man silenced.\n\nJane\u2019s face was directly facing mine now. Only her unfocused blue eyes told me that she was still blind.\n\n\u201cYou can see?\u201d She asked, her hoarse voice cracking. She reached out her hand and found my face.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered, my tears from the sun now turning into tears of happiness. \u201cI can see. I can see. I can now help us. I can see.\u201d\n\nShe came closer and put her other hand on my face. I didn\u2019t realize how much I had missed when Jane cradled my face in her hands, the heat of her palms warming my cheek. She wiped away a tear with her thumb.\n\n\u201cI need your eyes,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI will be your eyes, I will always be your eyes.\u201d I said. I sniffed back the snot that was beginning to flow from my nose.\n\nHer hands moved from my cheeks next to my eyes. She traced a finger over my eyelid, a broken nail lightly scratching the soft skin.\n\n\u201cI need your eyes,\u201d she said again, this time more loudly. She began to press her fingers lightly around my eye sockets.\n\nThat\u2019s when movement around me caught my eye. The three other people in the alley with us had risen to their feet and had formed a circle around me and my wife. Panic rose in my chest.\n\n\u201cJane, we need to get out of here,\u201d I whispered, placing my hand on her arm. I went to push her hand off my face, but she tightened her grip. \u201cOuch!\u201d I gasped, her fingers pressed further into my eyes. \u201cStop!\u201d I pushed her off of me. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\n\nAnimal like, Jane leaped back at me, pushing me over from my knees onto my back.\n\n\u201cI NEED YOU EYES!\u201d she screamed.\n\nI pushed her off me again, but another hand shot out and grabbed my shoulder. It was the man who seconds ago was peeing next to me.\n\n\u201cShe needs your eyes,\u201d he said as he stared over me.\n\n\u201cShe needs your eyes,\u201d the others began to whisper. \u201cWe need your eyes, I need your eyes, need to get your eyes.\u201d\n\nAnother hand reached out pinning my other arm, my leg, my torso.\n\n\u201cI can help you! I can help all of you!\u201d I screamed, thrashing and kicking, but their hands wouldn\u2019t move.\n\nJane peered over me, her face leaned down to meet my own and for a second I thought she was going to kiss me.\n\n\u201cBen,\u201d she whispered, one hand on my cheek, the other stroking my temple. For a second, her blue eyes locked onto my own.\n\n\u201cI need your eyes.\u201d",

As if the lights of my mind had been shuttered off and then on again by the huge hand of a god.\n\nI froze there. I did my best not to look surprised. I just kept staring ahead at the blurry grey wall of my apartment, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Of the fact that I *was* seeing. No one had seen anything in over two years.\n\nNot that I could ever see well. My vision was even worse than normal, a milky blur filtering out the world.\n\nMaybe I was dying. Maybe this was one last vivid, terrific hallucination of the world as it used to be.\n\nMy eyes burned like I'd fallen asleep with my contacts in, a feeling I hadn't had to worry about since the day I woke up just as blind as the rest of the world. I reached up and rubbed hard at them until the fog cleared. \n\nThere was a handwritten note there above my television. A careful little army of letters, marching forward. I leapt off the couch and beelined toward it, until my nose was nearly touching the drywall. Close enough to be able to read for the first time since the Blinding. \n\nThe message said, in a stranger's handwriting, DON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.\n\nA dark hand coiled around my spine. I knew exactly who they meant. There was only one class of people who escaped unscathed during the Blinding. They were the very same who installed the radio in my wall, who kept all of human society going. Only us fully biological humans lost our ability to see.\n\nMy stare darted to the radio, still humming away in its slot on the wall. The radio had a single  black dial, a speaker, and a shiny black circle I had never been able to see before. The government had subsidized these devices as a way to help us all adjust to the new change of waking up suddenly and horribly blind. \n\nThe radio spun out some light oldies tune. How long had it noticed? Had it yet noticed?\n\nWould *they* notice?\n\nI spun away from the wall and pawed around on the floor, pretending to look for something I dropped. I tried to keep my stare blank, unfocused, but in the corner of my eye, I watched that radio.\n\nI watched that strange, shiny black circle I had never seen before.\n\nI felt foolish and stupid, kneeling there on the floor, doing my best to pretend to be blind. I should be running cheering down the street. I should be going to the nearest hospital to figure out what the hell I did that no one else could do. \n\nBut then another set of letters caught my eye. There, in black marker on the inner leg of my coffee table.\n\nNow I didn't have the room in my mind to think about danger or consequences.\n\nI stood up on trembling legs, and I turned my head to look boldly all around my apartment. \n\nEvery wall carried words. Some of them looked like they had been scrubbed and painted over, random patches of mismatching grey paint here or there. \n\nOver and over, every surface of my apartment screamed at me: DON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.\n\nA knock rattled my front door.\n\nI snapped my head toward it, then quickly away again. I tried my best to remember what it felt like *not* to see. How I held my head. Whether I kept my eyes open or shut or half-lidded, almost dead-eyed. \n\nThen I paused there, opening and closing my fists at my side.\n\nI did my best to gather what information I knew. \n\nI knew I was the first living, breathing human to see in over two years. I knew the shock on my face must have given me away by now. \n\n\"Ma'am,\" a robotic voice intoned at the door. \"Please do me the courtesy of opening up.\"\n\nAnd whoever was on the other side of my door, they sure as hell weren't human. Not fully. And something told me they weren't here to help. \n***\n/r/shoringupfragments\n\nMmm I'm not capable of writing short apparently! ~~Spinning up a part 2~~ \n\nHere's [part two](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/cvoaso/wp_you_lost_your_sight_along_with_everyone_else/ey5in0q/) :) Thanks for reading",

                    "comment": "I tried to look around without being too obvious about it. I needed some kind of weapon. Not much offered itself, not without stopping at the kitchen and getting a knife, which was hardly subtle.\n\nI picked up the snow globe off my mantle behind the couch. It had a thick layer of dust broken here and there by random smudges from my fingers, glancing off the glass. \n\nThe knocking at my door persisted, a staccato rap-tapping of metal on wood.\n\n\"Hang on,\" I called. I hid the snow globe behind my thigh and clicked the lock chain on my door into place. It wouldn't do much, not really. Not against a cyborg. Some models had hydraulic arms that could pry the very door frame off the wall. \n\nBut still. It was better than nothing at all.\n\nI let the door open as far as the chain would stretch. Every instinct in me wanted to press my face to the crack of the door, to see exactly who or what was out there.\n\nBut I made my face look blank. I made my eyes stare listlessly forward, at the knob of the door. I scooped up details in my periphery.\n\nA robot. You could tell by the vaguely rubbery texture of their skin. It's not flawed enough. No freckles, no moles. No fleck of arm hair when the sleeve pulls up. Just... perfect unbroken skin. The tech had improved since the last time I had really seen a robot, though. If I didn't know what to look for, I would have sworn, just looking at him, that he was human as me.\n\nThis was a male unit, judging by the hand and the sleeve of his suit jacket. I half-expected him to be a cop, but robo-cops were obvious. They emitted a horrible, unignorable beep, to warn us unsighted that they were coming. \n\nNo, this was a robot in an expensive suit and an even more expensive shell. Here to see me, of all people.\n\n\"Hello?\" I said, uncertainly. \"Who's out there?\"\n\n\"Ms. Pynchon, I am with the repair company. There appears to be an issue with your radio unit.\"\n\nMy stomach pitched. \"I didn't call for any repairs.\"\n\n\"Your radio has a backup system to self-report. Please.\" He reached out and gripped the doorknob, just delicately enough to make sure the door did not move. I could see his eyes darting up to watch the door chain, to make sure it didn't click and give him away.\n\nLike a drum, the mantra repeated itself over and over again in my head: *they know, they know, they know*.\n\nBut beyond my fear, something else burned. I was *pissed*. I had never felt so helplessly small. Like a piece of a machine I could never understand.\n\n\"My radio is fine,\" I said. I fought to keep my voice even and calm.\n\n\"Ms. Pynchon,\" the robot said, his voice never losing its perfect monotone, \"perhaps you need some assistance with your door.\"\n\nThe robot shoved inward, and I had to stagger back to avoid the the forward swing of the door. The frame splintered as the chain ripped away from it. The chain hung uselessly from my door, still clutching a tooth of wood.\n\nNow I openly stared. I could not hide it. \n\nThe robot straightened the lapels of his suit. He had the dark red, ever-churning eyes of an AI. All those calculations spun endless circles in his irises. His face creased in an attempt at a smile.\n\n\"I see your treatment has worn off,\" he said, conversationally.\n\nI held my ground. Held the snow globe clutched tight behind me. \"I don't think you're really with the radio company.\"\n\n\"Never worry, little blood bag.\" The robot clicked the door shut behind him. \"This happens to all of you occasionally. I'll make sure you don't remember this.\"\n\nHe looked around my apartment, grimly.\n\n\"Looks like we need to get you another clean up service.\" He smirked around at the words on the wall like seeing an old friend or an old enemy. \"They are persistent bastards, aren't they?\"\n\nHe tilted his head to admire the words on my walls.\n\nIt was my only chance.\n\nI lunged forward with the snow globe, swinging it high over my head toward him.\n\n***\n\n/r/shoringupfragments\n\nCheck out my sub if you'd like to read more :) thanks for reading!",

I've panicked twice, puked once, and read the message so many times the words don't look real. The letters don't look real anymore. *Don't tell them you can see*...\n\nSomeone clicks from downstairs in the house, an echoing click following soon after. The noises are accompanied, by the raucous laughter of my brother and his friends. They're probably listening to that podcast they like, the one that told stories from Before.\n\nI make my way from the room, to the bathroom, where I can see how dimly everything is lit. There's no need for light when you can't see. So I make the conscious effort not to reach for the light switch, and instead shut the door, using the little light from the outdoors to light up my face in the mirror. I study it curiously.\n\nI've never seen it before. I was blind before the Blinding occurred.",

I-I can-\" you immediately stop talking as you look on your wall and see writing in neat, red marker,\n\n\"Don't tell them you can see. Act like everything is normal. Carry out your day as usual.\" Following the strange writing you decide not to shout it to the rooftops like you thought of, but open the door to your bathroom. On the mirror, in the same, neat writing,\n\n\"Nothing has changed. Pretend to be blind.\" you start to feel uneased, scared if someone is in your apartment. You slowly exit your bathroom, grab some non-safety scissors, and search the kitchen, your small office, and the living room. In each room you see more of the writing, telling you to not change anything in your daily life, to act natural; in every room the writings become more frequent, more aggressive, and more insistent that you should never reveal this recovery to anyone, even the people you trust the most. No one is in your apartment, that for sure, but one thing is certain:\n\nIn the last two years, someone was, and you had no idea.\n\n\"DING DONG!\" rings the doorbell, snapping you out of this unnerving thought. You travel to your intercom, and say:\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"It's James, duh!\" Ah, yes. James, your best friend since college and your co-worker at Roy Industries, a company that started in manufacturing, specializing in disability aides such as: canes, hearing aides, wheelchairs, and stair-lifts, and after the Great Blinding, with everyone needing their products, grew into a ginormous cooperation that has a stake in almost every industry; everyone has heard of them, and most rely on Roy In. for their paycheck as well. You work in the admistrative section of the company, and so does John, you often walk to work together, as motor vehicles became too dangerous after The Great Blinding. Sure, it takes a while, but you live in the city, so at least it's not too bad of a commute; some people had to quit their jobs or move so they could work after the loss of an entire sense. Luckily, you lived close enough to not have to change your home/job, and so did John.\n\n\"You ready to go?\" John asked.\n\n\"What? Oh, sure. Let me just get my cane.\"\n\nWill write more soon, I just wanted to get the beginning on paper. (or, should I say, computer) Anyway, see you soon!",

            "comment": "I walk along the street. It's a normal night like any other. Nothing special until I see the sun rise. Something was different the light was too bright. Far too bright. I close my eyes and they still burn from the light. I try covering my eyes as they're closed yet they're still burning. Until I can no longer see the light. \n\nI open my eyes to find darkness. I open my phone and say. Hey Google call 911. I hear cars crashing in the darkness. I get up and run away from the noise. I stumble and fall but I manage to follow the sidewalk home thank the gods I was taking my normal route.\n\n\"911 what is your emergency?\" The lady says. She sounds just as scared as I am. \"I can't see something blinded me this morning as the sun rose.\" She pauses for a second. \"Are you safe? She says.\" I find her question strange. \"Yes I managed to find my way back home.\" She sighed a bit. \"I'm blind as well and so are all of our emergency service workers. Just try and turn a radio or TV to a news station and await further instructions. We're all working in the dark right now. I don't even know how to tell people where to go!\" She begins crying and then regains her composure. \"Stay safe.\" she says as she hangs up. \n\nAfter years we manage to adjust and somewhat keep surviving cars aren't really a thing anymore. Everyone walks everywhere and cities are mainly abandoned but there's a lot of goods to raid from them to trade for food if you can manage it. Everyone's hearing has increased significantly. It's what we use along with scent to hide from predators mainly packs of wild dogs and occasionally escaped zoo animals. \n\nJust as it seems we'll adjust to our blindness. I am hiding from something I've never heard before in a shop. It doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard. All of a sudden I'm blinded again. It's like the blinding light from before. I see inside of the walls of the shop. Don't let them know you can see. Who were they talking about.\n\nThen as I step outside I see exactly who they're refrencing. Floating orbs with what seems like endless tendrils. They are carrying different people away. I go back into the shop and find a pair of thick black shades. I put them on my face and I pick up my walking staff. What in the world happened that day. \n\nThen I hear the \"drones\" that drop food to us. I see a few people come out of hiding. Turns out what we thought were drones were nothing of the sort. They latch there tendrils onto the faces of those nearby. Pumping something into us. Come to think of it the closer I look at them they don't look human at all....\n\nI try to walk normally back to the store. It's pretty easy to find a mirror since nobody would be raiding those since we're all blind. I look into it and my skin is moist with tendrils forming around my mouth. I was too distracted earlier at the return of my site to notice the webbing inbetween my fingers. The scales that were growing on my hand. \n\nI begin to have a headache. My blood feeling as though it's boiling. That's right I always went to the \"drones\" before this. I go back to them. They latch onto my face and begin pumping sustenance into my body. Then I feel it. They know is all I can think. I rip it from my face and I run to the store where I awakened my site. I don't know why. Call it instinct. I break the mirror and write. Stay away from the drones in my black blood. Soon it finds me soon it drags me from the store. \n\nIt takes me into its mouth. I feel myself disappear this isn't death. It's rebirth. I awaken my eyes are working. I am hiding from something. On the walls of the store I'm hiding in there are two messages. Don't let them know you can see and beware the drones. What does this mean?",

The sound of canes tapping the concrete ring in my ears as my pulse quickens.\n\n\"What am I going to do...\" I mumble under my breath before joining the crowd of people.\n\nThe hustle and bustle of everyday life when you're blind has become the norm. I got used to the routine of feeling my way to different locations by relying on my other senses. The shock of waking up and still being in the dark subsided after the first month. But...now that my sight has returned....\n\nA loud crash is heard over the scraping of canes. I instinctively look up towards the sound and before I can stop myself, I'm staring in the direction the noise came from. A toppled trash can rolls from side to side as people bump past it. A boy stands against the wall where the trash once was makes direct eye contact with me. I gasp and look down and away. I try to keep close to the street, avoiding eye contact with the boy at all costs.\n\nMy efforts are useless, however.\n\nThe boy intercepts me and grabs my wrist, pulling me down an alleyway. I struggle against his grip, but his hold tightens the more I fight. We stop at the end of the alley and he releases my wrist.\n\n\"Why did you-\"  I begin to say when he shushes me. \n\nI frown and lower my voice to a whisper as he looks at the street.\n\n\"Why did you drag me here? Who are you?\" I ask.\n\nHe turns toward me and looks into my eyes. His eyes were piercing, searching mine. He lets out a breath.\n\n\"I wanted to see if anyone else regained their sight. Only the people who can't see would look up so quickly to the sound of commotion,\" He looks over my shoulder at the street.\n\n\"We can't stay here. Follow me and try to not call attention to yourself. They have eyes everywhere.\" He whispers. \"We'll talk more when we are safe.\"",

I tilt my face towards the window, feeling the sun's warmth and imagining the warm orange glow that comes with it.\n\n\"Being on a plane must have been the worst,\" I say, stretching my arms out, aware of the blood flowing through them in a way I never was when I could see. \"One second flying towards wherever, the next totally blind with everyone else, including the pilots.\"\n\nI can still hear the passengers screaming in my day dream. I can hear them screaming all the way down.\n\nThe Great Blinding was the darkest - literally - day in human history. Everyone crashed their cars or fell off bridges or starved to death in city parks trying to find the grocery store. Even the animals went blind, and they all died as well. All sorts of terrible shit. Almost everyone died, except those who were already blind and their immediate caretakers, lovers, family members, or whoever else happened to be in close proximity when it all happened.\n\n\"Imagine the smell in the factory farms,\" I say out loud, replaying yet another aspect of the Great Blinding back to myself. It's how I cope, going over everything that must have happened that day and during the immediate fall-out. \"Imagine all those turkeys suddenly blind and unfed, resorting to ferocious cannibalization before the victors died from a lack of nutrients.\"\n\n\"Can you quit it just this once, Dan,\" Alice says, sounding run-down and tired. \"You just keep going on and on. I can't take it anymore. We've got a food run today.\"\n\nHer voice is soft and purpose-filled and I let it fill the room, allowing it to banish my incessant day dreaming. On that fateful day I had been helping Alice cross the street. That one altruistic deed saved my life, for Alice was already blind and for her the Great Blinding represented a minor inconvenience.\n\n\"Alright, Alice,\" I reply, standing up and feeling around for my straw hat. \"Hold on a second, one must always look the part these days.\" I smile as Alice softly chuckles in the background.\n\nI pick up the straw hat and another form of blindness hits. Objects and shapes and the bright rays of the sun blanketing everything. Sensory overload.\n\n\"What the...,\" I say, blinking rapidly. Objects come into focus. My brain re-calibrates its orientation in this world and everything comes flooding back. I see (actually see!) my warn hands holding this warn hat. My eyes are unable to cope and they sting as tears flow freely down my cheeks.\n\n\"What is it?\" Alice asks, concerned.\n\n\"I can see! Alice, I can-,\" I stop mid-sentence, becoming aware of the words plastered all over the walls, on the table and the chair and the window sill, and even on my hat.\n\n*Don't Tell Them You Can See.*\n\n\"Tell who...,\" I wonder out loud, the words saturated with growing trepidation. A flash outside the window momentarily blocks the blindingly bright sun. A clamor comes from the front of the house, followed by a rapid scuffling.\n\nAlice folds herself into a corner of the room. \"Oh, Dan... You stupid, stupid man.\"\n\n\"What are you taking about? What's going on?\" The newfound brightness of the room sears my eyes with an intense pain.\n\n\"I blinded myself with a hot iron, Dan,\" Alice says sadly. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe clattering grows louder. I take a step towards the corner of the room, to where she is and where safety lies. The door creaks open and something impossible passes through, its sheer presence enveloping the room and me within it. Alice cries out, clamping down hard on her ears.\n\nA thousand voices speak from everywhere at once. \"You let us know. Good bye.\"",

At first it was a disaster, people wept and raged and died in droves, but it was barely two years now since the world went blind and these days, things are almost normal again.\n\nNikolai came out with their new self driving cars, fully optimised for their sightless passengers, meanwhile Pear and Congo got together and trained their voice assistants to better help us get around. Honestly, with technology being what it was, the blindness barely made a difference.\n\nStill, sometimes you almost felt like the darkness was bearing down on you, a pressure and oppression that became so constant you barely noticed it was there, like that slight ring in your ears in a quiet room.\n\nThere were fewer people too, I think my office only has 17 employees, including myself. Apparently it had more than a hundred back when the blindness first hit.\n\nI arrived at work today, like most others, and set about navigating my way to the dictation cubicles. Nick, my old friend from high school, bumped into me along the way. He seemed... perturbed, like something had worried him. I questioned, but he just spattered something about work stress and left. He was in such a hurry, he didn't even bother following the guide wires.\n\nIt wasn't until later that day that I saw him again, I was heading for my car when he asked if he could hitch a ride to my place to discuss work. Obviously I didn't mind, these days company was about the best entertainment available since TV and video games mostly faded away with our sight.\n\nWe got home and made our way inside, I could tell Nick was nervous and his anxiety was starting to rub off on me.\n\n&gt;I gotta tell you something\n\nI inquired, but he was hesitant\n\n&gt;Swear you won't tell anyone! Literally. LITERALLY! Nobody.\n\nI agreed, laughing nervously at his insistence.\n\nHe stood up and faced me, before muttering;\n\n&gt;I can see again...\n\nI laughed it off, sure he could, very funny, what colour shirt am I wearing? He didn't seem to think it was funny, and repeated himself.\n\nIt was annoying me now, he was lying, obviously. He couldn't see, nobody could. He kept going on about stupid messages on the wall. There were no messages, he was just attention seeking. All this for a laugh? \n\nHe kept rambling, trying to find ways to prove his lies, I wasn't listening any more. What was wrong with this piece of crap? He came into my house and starts this bullshit?\n\nThe world felt hotter as he ranted, why won't he just shut up about this? What's wrong with him. Shut up Nick. \n\nI found myself breathing faster, the weight of the dark was annoying me, it was like an itchy jumper and Nick just... Kept talking! \n\nI told him to shut it, he asked why I was standing, why I was scowling. How the fuck does he know what my face looks like? What nonsense trick is this?\n\nWhy is the air so fucking heavy!? He can't see nobody can fucking see what the fuck is wrong with him shut up seriously shut the fuck up just get away just fucking stop stop stop fucking stop this I hate it I hate you so fucking much just burn burn in hell hate hate fucking die already\n\nHonestly I barely even notice the blindness anymore. About the only change I've noticed is there seems to be far fewer people. I remember a busy world when I was a kid, but these days my whole office only has myself and 15 other people working there.\n\nStill, it's strange, sometimes, when I wake up of a morning, I swear I see the faintest glimmer of light. I wonder if my vision is starting to come back?",

I \u201cwoke up\u201d that morning, explicitly feeling that my eyes were open, but they looked as if they were closed. I forced them open but they still showed nothing. I screamed to my parents about my situation but they gave me the same response. Everyone had lost their sight, all across the globe. After that, everything\u2019s been blank, figuratively and literally.\n\nWell, today started unlike any other in the past few years, I \u201cwoke up\u201d, made my self breakfast only by touch, as I had learned to do, and got ready for my short commute to my school.\n\nThe Day went as usual, staying in one classroom all day, reading, or feeling rather, textbooks about subjects that would\u2019ve stayed around even if no one had lost their sight, and repeated with different subjects.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, I saw.\n\nMy sight\u2019s back... And I immediately see text scrawled all over every solid object. It reads:\n\nDon\u2019t Tell Them You Can See\n\nThe multiple scrawlings of the phrase looked as if they were written in blood, and everyone except me was oblivious. I quickly asked to go to the restroom and exited the class. The phrase still lined the walls, roof, floor, everything. I left the school immediately and rushed home. \n\nMy parents didn\u2019t hear me enter and even my house was covered in the crimson phrase. I rushed upstairs and threw open my old laptop that hadn\u2019t been used in years. I searched up if anyone else could see; nothing. I was the only one. \n\nWhat now? I couldn\u2019t tell anyone, and no one else can see either.\n\nI thought long and hard of any way to figure out why I couldn\u2019t say anything about my regained sight.\n\nMy mind came up blank. I guess I could relive some memories by watching some YouTube? No. I need to find out about this. \n\nI went outside and looked around.

            "comment": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\] ***The Sightless - 2 years ago***.  \nWhen I was a child my mother would instruct me to put on blindfolds when I had uncontrollable tantrums. Growing up in the Caribbean this form of 'punishing therapy' was unheard of. Where other kids would get a stern lashing that multiplied by the crescendo of anger, I was given exercises to manage myself.  After The Great Blinding those games I played had taught me to manage. When it began I screamed, I yelled, I hyper ventilated - and then I became fortunate that I didn't share the fate of those who were driving. I heard cars collide into objects, people, animals. Someone killed themselves, I believe.   \n\n\nFor two whole years I lived like this. You would never want to imagine the despicable things I did to survive. I would lure animals into my home and butcher them. For dogs I cuddled them, covered their muzzles when they found trust in me, and I would take my kitchen knife and gut them. I cried every time. I don't know what other people did. The lucky ones who stocked up on canned goods probably fared better. But that was the beginning. By year two I learned to use a walking stick made from a broom handle. I would venture out into the open, occasionally someone else would be on the streets. The air smelled pungent and sour. Bodies were here and there, and I knew this. I carefully avoided them the best I could but would sometimes run into one and fall. Have you ever fell in garbage before?   \n\n\n6-months into the second year of the Great Blinding I noticed I heard sounds that were alien and familiar at once. Helicopters? Yes. That's what they were. Had to be. God I needed a shave back then. I could feel the hairs on my chin itch at the thought of everyone being rescued, and then brought into what? I dismissed the thought as childish wish-fulfillment. But then the streets began to smell cleaner, the air smelled crisper. Something was going on. But that only happened for a month. I'mguessing that people began to adapt to sightless travel? Who knew. Technology like that was probably in development long before; you know how there's always research and development going on? Bah. More childish thoughts.   \n\n\nIt wasn't until the morning 4 months later, I think it was four. I'm not sure, but four months later I that the light in my eyes opened while on a walk. And then I saw colours. Beautiful, vibrant. It was as if I was born again. The trees were green. The streets, cleaned. Paved roads, houses rebuilt. What in the hell happened? The sun's brightness irritated me for a while until I truly adjusted. I didn't discard my stick, I kept it on my back as a sort of relic to ward me from the evils that could be reality. I wasn't sure this was a permanent phenomenon. I raided a food store. Someone else and another and more have thought the same as I did. There wasn't much fighting. Actually, none except for an argument over who got the last tomato paste. I'd imagine there wasn't much people left on my island. I smiled. Good ol' Bahamians. I took as much ravioli and canned soup as I could manage and carted whatever I could back home. And then, my eyes opened once more - \"Don't tell them you can see.\"  \n\n\n\\[2\\] ***Seeing blind - 2 years later***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Don't tell them you can see\" was sprayed all across the walls in my living room. \"Don't tell them you can see\"? I repeated out loud. I pondered what it meant, tugging at my straggly beard, reminding me I needed a shave. Don't tell who I can see? Who are they? Who is them? It wasn't anyone in the food store, was it? No. Someone came in my home and vandalized it. Were they those men from the helicopters?   \n\n\nThe following day I walked the same eastern road streets and then I saw \"them\". Men in tactical uniforms with helmets that shielded their eyes and a hollow eye printed over it, grabbing a small bracket of people. I wasn't noticed. I fell back and observed behind an obstacle.   \n\n\n\"Secure the area and round up all of the 'sighters!'\" called out a heavily armed man of a large muscular build. \n\n\"Man you can't do this to me!\" The 'sighter' protested. So we were sighters now? It's amazing the things we invent to disregard humanity, then apply onto one another. Fearing that I was next I avoided sight until I bumped into someone. Oh shit.   \n\n\nThere, behind me, was medium framed female with plump lips with a thin scar across the top and bottom. She has seen violence and has committed it as well. I thought to stand clear. She put up her hand and waved it in front of me. What saved my life was \"Don't tell them you can see\" which I remembered intimately as it was a great trouble to remove it from my wall. Then she circled around me, stopping in front of my face once she did not see my eyes connect with her movements. Finally she pulled out her hand gun and I faced the business end of the nozzle. After a solid minute I stood still looking around aimlessly. I feigned blindness, turning my head to face the sound. She took a step closer until I said, \"Who's there?\"  \nThat took her by surprise and she withdrew her weapon. Her voice was melodious but rough, \"All clear here. You should return home. It's dangerous out here, we have hijackers and robbers. People who wish to do you harm. Where do you live? I'll escort you ba-\"\n\n\"No need. I can find my way home. I was blind before The Great Blinding.\"  \n\n\nShe paused. Something was wrong. She drew her weapon once more, and spoke into her comm, \"Possible sighter, engaging with the suspect, over.\"  \n\n\n\"W-what? I-I can't see, I swear!\" She took me by the arm and subdued me on the ground. I had no hopes of winning this fight. I haven't fought anyone in years. I tried to resist but only because the floor was hard and it was hot. The sweat on my face allowed small pebbles to stick to it. I could feel my skin grating against the concrete while her knee was pressed into my back. She got out a pair of handcuffs, which I knew because of the sound. Where was I going to be taken to? I had no clue.   \n\n\n\"I have the suspect secured. Awaiting detention van.\" She said into the comm, then turning to me, \"We're going to find out everything we can about your organization. You're making this harder for all of us. You PUPILs won't stop until we're all dead.\" She slammed her gun into my head so hard it bounced against the floor and I passed out.   \n\n\n\\[3\\] **PUPIL**\n\nI was aroused to consciousness when I heard the sounds of violence. Someone was fighting. Was it more of those soldiers? I heard a body drop, then gunshots. It was hot, my skin was broken and bruised, I felt pain everywhere. Then I felt a strong grip grabbing my bicep, pulling me to my feet.   \n\n\n\"You shouldn't have let them know you knew about the Great Blinding.\" The voice was warm and authoritative. I turned around to face my rescuer. It was a short man with a bushy beard. He had several other people behind him. Two women, a boy, and three other men.  I noticed the rescuer had a tattoo of a crying eye on his neck. I assumed everyone else had a similar tattoo. \n\n\"We are PUPIL. I tagged your house. Like us, you are a 'Seer', and not a 'Sighter'. We're all over the globe. The radio you heard was us. They're rounding us up and feeding us to 'it'. But we are resisting that. You must come with us, we'll tell you the rest along the way. In fact, we must hurry.\"\n\nI felt the urgency of his words and was too afraid of being roughed around to protest. So I followed them. It was becoming dusk. I heard strange noises from the sky. As I turned my head around I saw what IT was...A large chirpoteran creature with tentacles standing in place of its face and human arms wrapping around its torso was flying through.  \n\n\n\"YOU FOOL!\" Shouted the bearded saviour. He covered his eyes and threw me a knife, \"You let it know you can see. We are anomalies! We either become them or stay like us, but once it knows you can see it comes after you. Take this. If you surive, find us at the Dundas centre for the performing arts. Good luck.\"  \n\n\nTo prevent me from following he pulled out a gun, aiming it at me until he was far enough. I picked up the knife and examined it. Then I looked back up. The creature was descending. I looked down at the knife, and then I thought to myself *I have little choice but to fight. This is a whole new world I've opened my eyes to, and I plan to survive and see it through. I will join PUPIL. I will live.*",

            "comment": "The blindness passed by some sort of contagion, and by dumb luck I managed to avoid it.  I had been out in the cabin in Montana.  The cabin I always hated but had acted as my unwitting savior.  I wasn't outdoorsy like my dad.  After Dad died, Mom wanted to sell the cabin: she wasn't outdoorsy either.  Someone had to go and make sure it was in decent enough condition to sell.  \n\nOut of cell phone range.  No Internet access or television.  Only a CB radio for emergencies that I had never really bothered to learn before, so I tried to learn all the basics from an old manual.  There wasn't much else to do.  \n\nThe cabin was sellable at least, until the world collapsed and then people weren't really wanting to live miles out in the middle of nowhere.  They wanted to live by other people. \n\nI was driving back through a small town when an older man stumbled out in the middle of the road.  I slammed on the brakes and the car halted inches away from him.  He stood still and angled his head, never quite looking at me.  I learned why when I saw a milky white sheen had covered his eyes.  \n\nI could not bring myself to move, to do the decent thing and get out and apologize for almost killing him.  \n\n\"A car!\" he yelled, his voice carrying like a town crier's.  \"I heard a car!\"\n\nSlowly other people emerged.  They, too, stepped cautiously, tapping their canes.  All of them had the same milky white affliction that the man had.\n\nWham!\n\nOne of the townspeople had found the car.   \n\nThis soon followed by more whams as they slapped against the car doors and trailed their hands along to the windows.  \n\nThen -- crash -- the back windshield and a side window splintered as canes turned into temporary battering rams.  Their hands started reaching in, seemingly undeterred that the jagged glass was slicing into their hands and wrists.\n\nI slammed on the horn.  It startled some of them back, the ones closest to the driver's seat.  I took advantage of that second and pressed the gas pedal down hard.  The car lunged forward and the people lunged forward with it.  I swiveled a bit, trying to avoid striking the people in front of me, but I couldn't quite avoid them.  Even so, I would not let myself slow down until those people were far behind me.",

Someone screamed, someone got stabbed, someone got shot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImmediately shit hit the fan I dove under the table. I stayed there until I heard The Voice.

That was my first mistake, but at the time I did not know. Thoughts began racing through my mind, who shouldn\u2019t I tell? Why shouldn\u2019t I tell them?

Let\u2019s recap what\u2019s happened so far. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy door burst open and my handler came in with 5 others that looked exactly like him. I\u2019m guessing it was my handler because out of the people in that room he felt the most familiar. \n\nThey looked human but there was something about them that didn\u2019t feel human. Their eyes were dead and their movements were almost robotic. \n\nMy handler and I locked eyes for what felt like an eternity but was probably less than 10 seconds. It was at that point I knew that I had fucked up,\n\n\u201cHe can see.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s all he said but it was enough. In a moment, everything became a blur of motion. I tried to fend them off but fighting had never been my strong suit. I was knocked out and when I came to I was tied up in what appeared to be a dentist\u2019s chair. I\u2019ve been trapped here since then I haven\u2019t seen another soul.\n\nThe only reason I know how much time has passed is because there\u2019s a digital clock on the wall. \n\nAre they trying to drive me mad by depriving me of human contact? Are they trying to see if my insanity is contagious? Are they waiting to see if I\u2019ll try to escape? Have they forgotten about me?\n\nThese were the questions I forced myself to think about. There was one that kept buzzing at the back of my brain but I didn\u2019t want to pay any attention to it. \n\nDid I ruin someone else\u2019s chance at escape?\n\nThat was the thought, and no matter how much I tried I couldn\u2019t ignore it. \n\nBefore I came to jail I wouldn\u2019t have cared about anyone other than myself. That\u2019s what happens when you have enough money to change the world; when you have enough money to buy anyone\u2019s loyalty. You forget that at the end of the day we are all human. I only ended up in jail because I was cocky. 3 years in jail is enough to break the cockiness out of anyone. When you don\u2019t have butlers and maids, you learn to rely on friends. \n\nAnd now I was worried that I might have jeopardized their chances of escape. It\u2019s funny how life changes people.\n\nBefore I could continue my introspection, a door opened and someone came in. It was the first woman I had seen in a long time but I honestly couldn\u2019t bring myself to care. I had more important things to think of.\n\n\u201cHey could you untie me! Hey are you even listening?\u201d\n\nI kept shouting like that for a while but it had no effect on her. She just walked around me, stared and nodded her head.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll make a good host for you my lord.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t even have enough time to get scared. Something enveloped me and I lost control of my entire body. I felt a presence in my mind and soon it overwhelmed me.\n\nI was a prisoner in my own body. \n\nThe bonds were cut and I felt my hands flex. \n\n\u201cGood, now let\u2019s see how many more of them can see.\u201d",

            "comment": "Blind full-time was much harder than blind part-time. When I woke up to my mother screaming and I didnt see out of both eyes this time, I figured I'd schedule another doctor appointment. My syndrome usually affects both eyes, and I guess I was fortune enough to only have it in one the past few years. Not only will I have to update my doctor, but I'll have to get a higher dosage.  I tapped my way across my bedroom to the bathroom where my medicine was. These drops usually help bring my vision back but I'll have to get a higher dosage now that I need double the amount. But after taking my eye drops, nothing happened. And that's when I screamed too. The black never faded, and I always wanted to see little Jaxin grow up. \n\nBefore the event, I could navigate short bursts of time being blind. I could walk around my home and navigate myself around the local area. Working though, was something I had to give up.  One of the most infuriating features of the blindness was that I was almost done with my latest piece, but it will never be finished. Of course after denying every mentor who said self-portraits are the true obstacle to being an artist, I had relented. And now I'll never break that tiny barrier for myself. \n\nThis morning I fumbled with a little ball of clay. Jaxin had grown quite a bit in size and I always wanted to remember him when he was small. Before the blindness, that could've been commemorated in photos or drawings. But this way I'll always be able to hold him. My fingers mashed and spread where I could to resemble what he might have. When I felt satisfied, I stored the half-done creation away. Maybe I can still do art. Maybe I can just finish what I started. \n\nI walked over to where a mirror was previously placed in my home before the event. Not that it would help any, but if I could just use it for a minute to adjust the light bouncing in the room, that would be great.\n\nWhen I touched around the wall, which was covered in dust, I couldnt find the mirror. I knew it was around here, but just out of reach. When I did reach it, in its place was cotton cloth. \"What the....\"  I trailed off, clasping whatever was there between my fingers. When I set the object down on my work table, I clipped the fabric in hands and pulled to reveal the mirror beneath it. And suddenly the light wasnt just light anymore. It was manifested into an image- an image of myself. There was writing. It spelled out \"Don't tell them you can see\". \n\nI lifted my head and glanced around the room. My pictures that I had drawn before were more or less the same, and my art supplies was still strewn across the office. It looked barely lived in. \n\nI needed to see Jaxin. Without wasting another moment I pulled out my cellphone to call my mom. \n\n\"Hello?\" \n\n\"Mom, where are you and jaxin?\"\n\n\"We just left the store. Why, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"I just need to see-\" I stopped myself. \n\n\"Liv?\"\n\n\"I just needed to see if you could come feel the progress I did. On Jaxin's sculpture\"\n\n\"Oh? Oh, yeah okay. Well be home in a minute\". \n\nI flipped my phone shut and went for the door of the office. Who wrote that message? Who did that in my home? When I went to the bathroom of my house i found the mirror left similar- covered. This time in newspapers taped onto it. I ripped them all down and there it was: dont tell anyone you can see now. \n\nNow? \n\nI stood for a moment lost in thought. \"Now\". The mirrors have to be triggering my vision coming back. But who's \"them\"? What could they do to us if they knew we saw? When I heard jaxin and his gleeful laugh outside, I knew I needed to protect him and my mom. And that means keeping them from being targets. I ran back to my former art office and I grabbed spray paint and quickly glazed over the mirror I left in the office. I made my way to the bathroom and did the same for just about any mirror I could find. Then I opened the windows and turned on the fans to air out that God awful scent of spray paint. I heard the front door open and rushed down the stairs. \n\n\"Mom?\" \n\n\"Hi honey.\" She set down a few bags. And there he was. \n\nJaxin was two when the blindness came. And his once blond curls had darkened. The child-like chunkiness he had to his cheeks had hallowed out, and the small chubby toddler I once knew was a taller, darker haired skinny boy. That's when I lost it, truly. Searing hot tears rolled down my face and I felt a lump too big in my throat to speak. \n\n\"We got potato bread. Funniest thing today, I talked with Melissa this morning on the phone.\" mom continued. \"Her and Dave are considering marriage. Youd think after he ran off for all those years shed be scared of cold feet. But shes ecstatic.\"\n\nI couldnt say a word, so I didnt. \n\n\"Honey? Liv?\" \n\n\"Hold on. I got something in my eye\" \n\n\"Oh, okay. You remember where the eye drops are?\" \n\n\"Yeah. Thanks\". \n\nAs much as I wanted to take Jaxin into my arms and hold him forever, I turned up the stairs again to compose myself. I went to our bathroom once more and turned on the faucet. While the water ran I splashed it into my face. The room was mostly aired out by now, so I decided to shut the windows. When I walked over to the only one there, I seen it.  I seen them. In the Mrs. Kratzers yard, I seen a figure. Dark, but roughly human sized. Only with more arms and legs and no face. I froze in the window, watching. Everything in me wanted to scream for Melissa to take her daughter and run, but I couldn't. Mrs. Kratzer sat on her porch, her daughter and Jaxin's best friend playing in the yard. \"Sadie, dinner is done!\" She holared. Sadie stopped playing with her toys and grabbed the figures hand. \"Come on, dad!\" She quipped as she drug him forward. \n\nJaxin knocked on the bathroom door. \"Can I come in?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\nHe shuffled in and searched through the drawers of the cabinet. He pulled out a hair tie and began to tie his hair back. He needed a cut, but we all did. Maintenance went downhill. \n\nLaughter erupted from outside. \"Sadie sounds like shes having fun. Do you think mom will mind if I go eat dinner with Dave and Melissa?\" \n\nI kept watching through the window. Melissa and that thing and sadie were all sat on their porch with sloppy Joe's in hand. \n\n\"I'd like it if you stayed home\" I said.",

Hannah has refused to even try to open her eyes for the past year and a half, due to the pain of being disappointed every time. It was five a.m. and there was still no significant light, not that Hannah cared now. Hanah in her heavy state, lies in bed for a few more hours attempting to summon the color green into view. Oh how she longed to see the color of the spring breeze combing the grassy meadows, the color of a mossy brook running through a bright forest, the color of life. \n\nHannah was so deep into her day dream when she is startled by a flash of light. She hesitantly opened her eyes but she still couldn't see. She stumbles to her light switch that has been out of use since the Great Blinding. She sits and prepares herself for the possibility of vision but then finally flips the switch. \n\nThe light splits her head, immediately giving her a mind curdling migraine. Impossible. Hannah squeezes her eyes shut in pain, but eagerly opens them again. What brilliance everything had. Her white curtains glow with light of the sun behind them, the red bedding she chose three years ago slightly faded but beautiful nonetheless. Hannah scanned the room taking in all of the colors that as they screamed for attention. Her eyes then focused on the symbols on the wall that she used to know so well. After staring at them for a few seconds she began to remember something she hadn't realized she forgot. Words. It all came back, every letter she had read, from what seems like decades ago. \n\nAfter recalling everything she knew about reading she felt dread fill her body. She did write those words. They were not hers. Which ment someone had been in her room. \n\nDON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE. \nDON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE. \nDON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.\nDON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE.\n\nThese same seven words were written everywhere.\n\n Wall. Window. Desk. Door. Her hand. \n \nFrantically she left her apartment, tripping on everything as she did. Hannah staggers into the deserted street. The same words were written on a bench, a billboard, a broken down car, and every other surface. Who is them and why can't they know? \n\nMovement catches Hannah's eye. A man in uniform rounded the corner onto the same street Hannah stood in. He was to alert to not be able to see. Quickly Hannah retreated behind her front door and watched the stranger. He was carrying a bucket of paint. He starts to paint over the words that were posted everywhere. \n\n\"Damn it. The Eyes are getting out of control. Every freaking street. Is it really necessary?\" He says under his breath. \n\nThe Eyes? Hannah can't even begin to comprehend what she is seeing. Why can this man see? Why is he painting over those ominous messages if everyone is blind? \n\nThen as if out of the blue a woman appears infront of Hanna's door. \n\n\"Hannah, let me in. You can't be seen by the Fold\" she says as she quickly pushes past Hannah before she had time to respond.\n\n\"Th- the fold?\" Hannah stammers, \"Wait who are you? How do you know who I am?\"\n\n\"I'm Theia, the leader of the Eyes, and that man is part of the Fold, as in Blind Fold. They are the reason for everyone's blindness. They started all of this.\"\n\n\"What? We were told that this was caused by that facility blowing up two years ago. It was an accident\" Hannah said as if she had rehearsed it.\n\n\"No that's just the story The Fold has told everyone\" said Theia, with a tone of disdain and rage.\n\nHannah still was lost in all of this new information and her new gift of sight. Was this a gift?\n\n\"Why can I see? And why are you, the leader of th-the Eyes in my apartment? Why me?\"\n\nTheia hesitates, \"Let's start at the beginning, I am the Titan Goddess of sight and divine light, mother of Helios, Eos, and Selene. I was called upon two years ago when the Fold, lead by Erebos born of chaos, managed to blind all of humanity. I didn't respond until a year ago because I thought you my love would have fixed it but I was wrong. You have forgotten everything, haven't you, my sweet Selene?\"",

            "comment": "As I wake up, I lie on my pile of fabrics fighting the urge to open my eyes, just as I have done for the past 741 sleeps. Even after all this time, the disappointment remains. I never realized before The Great Blinding how much I needed color, how much I would miss the pink of his lips or the brown and honey flecks in his emerald irises. I didn\u2019t consider how much I would miss the neon red and blue that accompanied the ever-present rhythmic hum of the vacancy sign in front of the hotel room we were in when darkness hit us all. \n\nEyes still closed, I can smell the twenty three other people crowding the hotel lobby. I hear Stephen\u2019s low snore like the hum of a bee stuck in a mason jar. I hear the buzz of the vacancy sign. My fingers wander up the pile of fabric to brush my hair off my face. Between the layers of denim, cotton, and burlap, my fingertips find the soft silk scarf I carefully place by my head each time I go to sleep. I try so hard to imagine the scarf dancing with color\u2014 bright blues and greens swirling behind red floral bursts. Maybe the scarf is purple with gold Greek-style trim like ancient royalty. Maybe it\u2019s a silk print of Van Gogh\u2019s starry night and I\u2019ve been sleeping atop the swirls of the stars I\u2019ve so missed. It hurts to remember sight but I have to. I have to hold onto it. I cannot forget color and curves and faces. \n\nThe feeling of the silk pushes me, as it has at every awakening since I found it over a year ago, to just try. Just try to see. On the count of three I\u2019ll open my eyes. \n\nOne \n\nTwo\n\nThree\n\nSlowly I open them and look around. Am I fooling myself? Have I lost my mind? Is my imagination playing tricks on me? It\u2019s dim but I can make out shapes. I can see colors! With the rhythmic hum of the vacancy sign the room grows a blue glow through the large wall of windows at the front of the hotel lobby. By the 5th blue glow, my eyes are beginning to adjust. That\u2019s when I see it: DON\u2019T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE. \n\nIt\u2019s written on every wall. It\u2019s written on the windows. Panic quickly replaces the awe I\u2019ve just been washed with. I close my eyes hard. Open them. The scene remains. Slam my eyes closed. Open them. No change. Once more I close my eyes. The darkness is comforting for the first time in two years. With eyes tightly clenched and breath held firmly in my lungs, I reach my hand towards the sound of Stephen\u2019s gentle snores. I can feel his face. The stiff but soft hair on his cheek pacify me. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, sunshine?\u201d whispers Stephen\u2019s soothing, still-sleepy voice. I finally exhale. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I got startled. I\u2019m fine now\u201d I keep my eyes closed as I run my fingers the length of his beard once more. I open my eyes again and my gaze falls toward my finger tips. The fear and panic immediately return. I feel dizzy. I feel nauseated. I can\u2019t catch my breath. \n\nIt isn\u2019t Stephen at all. It isn\u2019t even a human. Whatever it is, I cannot let it know I can see.",

            "comment": "\\[tw, light self mutilation\\]  \n\n\nIt didn't happen all at once.\n\nThe nations all lost their sight gradually. It was a slow seeded plague on humanity; anyone from important leaders to the homeless lost their eyesight suddenly, and what doctors tended to them could not fathom what had happened. Maybe it was mass hysteria. Maybe it was another facet of mental illness. It was waved away as just another illness to cure when there were only a few cases. The  government didn't really care at that time; it wasn't as much of a concern to them as what the president was writing on twitter.\n\nWhen the blindness began to spread, when waves of people were turning up blind in the streets \u2013 causing panic, unable to see, throwing themselves at cars and businesses and clinging manically to any person they could dig their fingers into \u2013 they were corralled like animals. People died in throngs then; either by waves of suicide, their rotting corpses stinking up alleys and their homes, or by police brutality. The news pedaled their wares; that those who were ensorcelled by this blindness were driven mad. They couldn't be reasoned with. To keep the public safe, if someone was 'too far gone', the police had to react swiftly and that sometimes meant civilian losses.\n\nThere were protests at first. Once the desperate, untreated blind found their way into the throngs of people screaming outside of the white house and their local police stations, the riots ceased. People were too scared to leave their homes and.. the world changed. As more people fell to the blindness, those unaffected began to agree with the hysteric media. Yes, the blindness was a disease. Who cared where it came from, people were being attacked on the streets! It wasn't safe to leave your house! They were spreading the blindness!\n\nCivilian militias formed and, quietly, using the blindness of the ill against them, they killed the easy ones first. Anyone who didn't struggle was just moments away from a frenzy, by their accounts. Bars would be full on the evenings, covered in barb wire and chicken mesh to keep away the desperate, like homes and schools and anything else that had to be kept safe. Spikes were placed on the ground, tearing up the feet of those without shoes, ruining the shoes of those who had them.\n\nThe blind weren't stupid. Aside from those hit with hysterics and who could barely function on their own when they could see, most of them learned quickly to keep to themselves. Many would claim they were blind before the epidemic hit, working together with those who actually had been and assistive facilities to get home, to get food, whatever they could to survive. This was short lived. It took one year for blindness to take everyone. Shame filled most of the world; those who had been killed in the initial hysterics had monuments built for them. Their names were etched, messily, into large concrete slabs that were painted and polished to be, at least to the touch, acceptable. Once the media organizations learned how in their blind stumbling, apologies were aired over the news. Groups of people came together to apologize to families of the lost. All of the anti-blind measures were removed. The ground was uneven and pocketed where once spike traps and other deterrents lived.\n\nSociety has recovered as much as it can. Doctors can't use their fancy medical equipment as well as they'd like, import and export is difficult when no one can see the state of the ocean to bring goods along. People get by. Society is recovering. We live in a world of blind being lead by the blind, by those who went blind and managed to adjust first.\n\nMy account was supposed to be just that. An account of things as they were; I lived through the worst of it. I was one of the hysteric many that fled into the streets first. I was terrified. Mania was replaced by fight or flight desperation for survival and I survived the first slaughter. I went home, barricaded myself inside, and did everything I could to find resources. It helped.\n\nTime after the Great Blindness took everyone has been.. okay. Lackluster, almost. I spend most of my free time sleeping. My dreams will ebb between old movies I've loved; I can see in my dreams. The knowledge I had once of what everything in the world looks like is still in there somewhere. My waking hours are spent making some money through working misc jobs online; I'd become accustomed to the voice that will read back to me as I type away at my keyboard, double checking my finger placement with the soft braille markings on top. I pause after each paragraph of writing, listening to her recounting it, making sure I've phrased and structured everything alright, that I haven't made a typo anywhere that massively changed a word into some discombobulated semblance of language. Those who have fancy self driving cars use them mostly as expensive food delivery services, and I'm lucky to have the ability to pay for that.\n\nAfter a delivery, mid-step in returning to the kitchen with a load of new groceries, my vision returned.",

                    "comment": "It was a snap; one moment I could see only the soft light of the windows against my eyes, shadows barely visible in the room of furniture carefully organized to be out of the way. The next, colour bloomed everywhere I looked. I felt an itching at the back of my neck, a wriggling vein or nerve or flex of the skin that begged to be itched. I stopped dead in my steps. I wasn't sure if what I was experiencing was just another dream, or if I was living it. I felt my body disconnect from my brain; everything was numb and empty for a moment, and I didn't know how to react. I scratched at the soft skin of my neck, laid my groceries down, and went to sleep.\n\nI was too afraid to open my eyes. I laid in bed after waking for hours, feeling the warmth of the covers, shirking my work, fighting the soft itch at the back of my neck begging for release. When finally my skin burned and I could feel a soft wiggling trail down my spine, I thought there might be something actually wrong, brought on by the return of my sight. A nervous system issue? Something with the spine? I wasn't a doctor and wanted to avoid going to one if I could. It took a while to convince myself to see if I had been hallucinating or dreaming. When I opened my eyes, they flooded with tears. My room was mostly what I remembered; posters and pictures of my young adult years pinned out of reach, reds and greens and yellows filling every inch of the single window in my room. It was autumn, and the colours I remembered were so breathtaking I felt nausea crawl up my stomach and sit in my throat, threatening to spill out with a whimper of awe. My apartment faced a park, and I knew exactly what I was doing next.\n\nMy neck burned hot as I stepped into the bathroom to prepare for a trip outside. My routine from when I could see was returning; I no longer touched door frames as I moved through the room, hands instead clamped at my neck as it pulsed hot underneath my fingertips. Standing in front of the mirror, I turned slightly, tugging my shirt down to peer at my neck. My skin from my shoulders to my neck and down was tomato red, as if I'd stepped into the sun without any sunscreen. Pockets of white newly-formed pustules were scattered over the skin, like infected meat. I swallowed and scratched gently along my spine, just at the back of my neck, and my vision faded in and out. One moment I could see the baby blue of my bathroom walls, the green of my eyes, and the next everything returned to the semi-grey I was used to. I scratched harder and with another blink everything returned.\n\nSearing pain flared along my spine. I could feel a pressure building there, and my skin bubbled up, a perfect dome of skin rising away from the sharp notches of my spine. My knees shook, barely able to hold my weight. Groaning, I dug a small pocket knife out from where I kept it in a drawer under the sink, along with some antiseptic. All I could focus on was the need to release the pressure. Antiseptic went on first, and I steadied myself as I dug the sharp end of the pocket knife into my skin. Where I expected pain I was met with only the desperate desire to go deeper. I felt a pop against the knife and the same white ooze that spanned my back seeped from the wound. Along with it came a thin purple tube. A worm. I dropped the knife into the sink, bloodied and coated in sticky white pus. I tugged at the worm and my vision faded. I tugged again and it returned. Six inches of worm later and another pop filled the room and my vision snapped back, colours even more vibrant than before. I let my body crumple to my knees and dropped the worm. It was long, tubular, with a hooked appendage at the end.\n\nAn hour later I was clean, dressed for outside, a thick bandage on the back of my neck hidden by a suitably festive sweater. The worm took residence in a jar, suspended in salty water with a lid duct taped closed. I wrapped it in grocery bags so I couldn't see it, wouldn't feel nausea roiling in my stomach again at the sight of the purple tubular thing. I was adamant I would go to the doctor, take my finding, tell them about it, and then maybe we could find a way of removing them. Making whatever had happened with me happen again.. figure out where it came from and what happened.\n\nI stopped in the doorway after opening the door. Every inch of the hallway was covered in writing. Spray paint, sharpie, and unknown substances smeared on the walls, sections barely legible for how dense the writing was. ***Don't tell them you can see.***\n\nThe message repeated down the hall. ***Don't tell them you can see.*** Traveling down the stairs to the apartment, every reachable section of the wall continued the writing. ***Don't tell them you can see.*** Stepping outside I was met with even more of the writing, scattered down the steps of the apartment, and as I turned to look back, written on each inch of the reachable sections of the apartment's front. The city was massive around me, and anywhere I looked I found the same six words peering back at me. People moved past, the soft tk tk tk of their canes an awkward thrum against the ground.\n\nEyes flit to me only when I opened the door to peer out, but it was business as usual for all of them; they couldn't see, the eye movement just a tick from their old lives. I peered after them, watching their movements, looking back to the words, then to the people moving like usual along the sidewalk. Some would pass with the same tomato red skin peeking out from under their clothing, and just once I was certain I saw a bulging dome of skin on the back of a balding man's neck, pulsing as he passed too close under the stairs. He itched halfheartedly, fingertips just brushing the skin. I took a step backwards, back into the building, fingertips digging into the doorknob as I stared at the words.\n\nThe soft baby hair along my ears shifted as a breathe eased over my neck.\n\n\"Don't tell them you can see.\"",

            "comment": "When The Blinding had occurred most had been asleep. It happened at exactly 2:57:34 AM CST, on the fourth of August, 2020. The event was gradual, like the dimming of lights, before flickering, and finally, I was unable to see. Sounds like the house shifting became more apparent, and the soft snore of my boyfriend filled the room. I deduced that I was tired, and closed out of the drawing application that my laptop was on. I gave my boyfriend a quick kiss (at that point it seemed as though I could see, just very little) on the forehead before dozing off beside him.\n\nThe next morning as we awoke to the utter catastrophe that was blindness we heard screaming from the apartment next to ours. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t just us? As we switched on the news I realized. This is happening everywhere.\n\nEventually, over the span of two years the world adapted. Service dogs were a requirement for all, and could easily help. However we realized we were in danger when people began getting sick. After one bump in the road, and then another... and another... we finally got going. \n\nAs I entered the hospital I felt a rush of cold air wash over me. A sudden tingle at the back of my head. I rushed outside, quickly running home. Something was wrong...\n\nMy boyfriend (now Fianc\u00e9) heard me enter the door.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Gabe?\u201d He asks. I\u2019m out of breath. My vision is coming back. I choke on the words. \n\nThen I see it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell them you can see.\u201d I tilt my head. Then look over at Ryan. His usually muscular look had been downgraded to sickly, and pale... But something else was wrong.\n\nIt felt like when you left your backpack at home as a kid. It wasn\u2019t right, you just didn\u2019t know why. \n\nThen I spotted him. Lean, black, wispy. A human face. No. A deer head. Long, sharp antlers, long legs, and an expensive wristwatch. His eyes were a crimson red, and one had an arrow show through. He glanced over and I stared blankly at the wall. Unmoving. Unblinking. He got up from his relaxed position. Sharp, pointed fingers reaching out, clawing at my neck.\n\n\u201cIt appears that you\u2019ve failed the challenge.\u201d",

            "comment": "The Great Blinding is proclaimed as the worst event to happen in human history. For me, that was certainly the case. \n\nMy mother was on a flight back home from her monthly work trip in DC. My father was on I-64, taking my grandparents to visit my sister and the twins she had a month prior. In an instant they were gone. Two generations of my family, gone.\n\nOver the course of a couple years, I managed to move in with my sister. Helping care for my neices during my mourning was the only thing that kept me sane.\n\nI told my sister I was going to make a trip to the old house this morning. I said my goodbyes and headed out. I had made the trek enough times to know exactly how many steps it would take along the abandoned interstate, every one bringing back memories of my family, good and bad. \n\nI was about halfway there when I tripped. I attempted to catch myself, but instead landed face first in a... puddle? No it was too thick for that. I sat up, wiping the slimey substance from my face. Slowly and painfully, light started to peek through. I was starting to see again. \n\nI heard movement down the road. My head snapped towards the noise. \n\nIt couldn't be, it's not possible... My vision was blurry, but without doubt I knew the first thing I was seeing with my renewed vision. Crumpled into the median, slowly rusting away, was my dad's car. What cruel irony is this? I can finally see again, and of all things, that's what I see first? \n\nNot a moment later, I saw what caused the noise. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, hell I couldn't believe I *was* seeing.\n\nAfter a moment my vision cleared. I couldn't contain my excitement. I shouted, \"Dad? Dad!\", waving my arms frantically. The figure of my father looked at me, then fell to the ground. A horrible shrieking erupted from everywhere. I tried to locate the source. Pools of the slime were scattered about, their nearly fluorescent white drew my attention away from the countless car wrecks. \n\nThe figure stood up. A tall, slender, brown, creature stood in my father's place. His eyeless face stared at me. The saliva dripping from his mouth was the same white as the puddles. More shrieking echoed down the interstate. 2 more of these monsters came from the wreckage of my father's car. Hundreds more appeared from seemingly nowhere, surrounding me.\n\nOn the wall behind my father and grandparents I could see a spray painted warning... \n\n\"Don't tell them you can see\"",

I'd gotten by with only Braille for the longest time. \n\nBut yeah it's been a crazy 2 years. Honestly, I'm terrified.\n\nMost people on Earth died in the Great Blinding, or the \"The Rapture\" as we call it here. People wandering around, unable to do anything, stuck miles away from home. How could they live?\n\nI would have likely been 1 of them, if I wasn't at home married to a blind woman. We never really cared for each other before, but after, she was the only reason I continued to live. I guess she kept me alive out of obligation; more likely it was to ward off insanity.\n\nHonestly, the blind people are the only \"normal\" ones left now.\n\nAll the rest are....something else. \n\nYou hear them at night sometimes.....just shuffling around. \n\nThey adapted, but there was a cost. \n\nI can.....see them now....with my own eyes...\n\nI don't like it....\n\nHonestly, the words don't bother me.\n\n\"DON'T TELL THEM YOU CAN SEE.\"\n\nIt's written everywhere on everything. I suppose I'm the only person alive who can see them.\n\nBut they don't scare me.\n\nThe people who can't see, the ones who lived, they scare me....\n\nIt's like a friend from before wrote me the advice. I'll follow it as long as I can.\n\nThanks for letting me write to you again Diary.\n\nMy wife's been uneasy lately so I can't talk to her.\n\nI suppose fighting off the \"new blind\" takes a toll on her.\n\n'Til next time.\n\nBye.",

            "comment": "On the day of The Great Blinding, I wasn't doing anything special. I had just been out on a grocery run after everything in the fridge had mysteriously spoiled, even though it had been fine the day before. I guess I should've stopped and thought about what the hell happened, even if just for a few minutes.\n\nWell, it wouldn't have mattered whether I had stopped to think about perfectly good food suddenly rotting overnight in the fridge. If I had paused that day, maybe I would've ended up dead. After all, suddenly losing your sight while you're in the middle of driving to the store is quite shocking. \n\nI remember the moment it had happened clearly as if it wasn't something that happened years ago. Maybe it's because that had been the very last thing I\u2019d ever seen. I had just picked up a carton of eggs when suddenly, the lights started flickering. I thought nothing of it at the time since it was very windy outside. Then after mere seconds of flickering lights, everything seemed to go back to normal.\n\n\u2019Oh the storm must be dying down a bit\u2019 I had thought before placing the carton of eggs in my trolley. \n\nOr at least, I tried to put them in my cart. \n\nBecause at that exact moment, everything went dark. I couldn't even see the light filtering in from the windows. And the carton that was in my hands had been dropped from pure shock as everyone, including myself, screamed. Maybe it was because everyone else was screaming that I joined in. I wasn't particularly scared, it was probably just stormy outdoors. Maybe it had even gotten cloudy while I was shopping. Though, from everything strange happening lately, I knew deep down something had gone wrong. I just didn't want to admit it.\n\nThat had happened two years ago. \n\nAnd when my sight suddenly came back, the first thing I came face to face with was a brick wall that said \u2019Don\u2019t tell them you can see\u2019.\n\nBut I still didn't know who \u2019them\u2019 was. The streets were completely empty. Which seemed odd....just seconds ago I could hear people chatting as they went about their day. Now there wasn't a single person in sight. And I didn't dare to turn around to look for anyone else. I was too scared to let anyone know that I could see now. Apparently.\n\nThen, I continued walking making sure to keep going about my day as if nothing had happened. Like I had just forgotten what I was doing for a moment. And as I continued moving forward, I took in my surroundings. Everything seemed so...lifeless and dull. \n\nWhat had happened two years ago?\n\nAs I rounded a corner, I immediately saw something different but I pretended not to be shocked. \n\nThank God for all those acting lessons I had gotten before The Great Blinding. \n\nBut what stood before me was what I could only describe as a monster. Whatever the hell it was, towered so high above me I couldn't see what I assumed to be its head. The monster itself had thin limbs -- so thin it was really just skin stretched over bones and joints. And this thing had pitch-black skin to top it all off. What a creepy aesthetic. Even for a monster.\n\nI kept on walking, hoping this thing wouldn\u2019t notice anything strange about me. But just as I was about to walk past it, the damn thing froze right in its tracks.\n\nAnd in an eerie, ghostly voice I heard it talk.\n\n\u201dI smell the fear of a visionary.\u201d \n\nAnd just as I began to walk right past it. Everything went dark for the second time in my life.\n\n\n\n\nI suddenly sat up on a way too uncomfortable sofa. Sweat training down my face as I saw a beat-up looking room. Torn posters covered one of the walls, all of which had wallpaper peeling off of them. And not to mention how the room was so damn dark. \n\n\u201dHey, look who\u2019s finally awake, \u201d a voice said.\n\nI turned to see a tired-looking man with dirty blonde hair looking at me with a small smile.\n\n\u201dWelcome to the rebellion.\u201d",

            "comment": "It's a normal day, in a normal town, in a normal country on a Tuesday. I struggle to finish my short story due on Thursday, and I'm drawing a blank. I decide to get up and get some fresh air. I walk to the store, say hi to some friends, and I'm debating whether or not to get a hot pizza from the Italiano's across the street. I decided why not, and walk in. as I look at the menu, my vision starts to blur around the edges, and soon I can't see anything, as I tumble to the ground. That's how it started, and it's also how it ended, 2 years later, with a few minor differences. the menu is a file on my Auditory Vision Replacement(AVR for short), and instead of vision blurring out, I start seeing light from the inside out. I wake up in the hospital. I can't bare to open my eyes, as the light flowing in from the window is too much for my unaccustomed eyes. Slowly, I manage to get my eyes open a little bit. Oh, gosh, I'm getting ahead of myself, aren't I? My name is Thomas, and like everyone else, I was blinded in the Great Blinding. For 2 years, we've all been being told that God has taken away our sight for being ungrateful of it. All bullshit, in my opinion. I think that they just wanted to make us blind for some reason. Don't quite know what.  \nBack to the hospital.  \nAs I lie in my bed, I slowly accustom myself to my surroundings. Looks much the same as I remember. \n\nA bit dirty, but nothing much. And then I see them.  \nThe words \"Don't tell them you can see\" were scrawled all over the wall. in bright red.  \nThe realization hits me...  \nSomeone \\*died\\* so that someone could see.  \nMust be pretty fucking important. \n\nmore in part 2...",

            "comment": "The world was fine, until it wasn't. One second, everything was fine. The next, darkness. Complete and utter darkness. People panicked, and many people died. I could still hear the screams of people accidentally falling off buildings, the countless bodies hitting the pavement, the horrid sounds of thousands of cars crashing all at once. It was a nightmare. Cars suddenly became bricks crashing through windows and people alike. Some houses burned as people couldn't find the knob for the stove. Some buildings collapsed as maintenance was near impossible without sight. The thousands of planes in the air eventually crashed as they all ran out of fuel. Extremely loud metal screeching could be heard as some ships slammed into the shore. After a year of utter chaos, the world finally began to settle.\n\nPeople managed to adapt, making improvised guide rails in stores and houses. Money was worthless now, since no one could work effectively anymore. Paper money was used for heating, and coins were used to give surfaces more texture. Humanity effectively had to start all over again.\n\nBut then it happened, I awoke one morning, and I could see. My walls, ceilings, and floors were all littered with the same message: \"Don't tell them you can see.\" It took a while for me to adjust. This wasn't the sight I was used to. Not only did I manage to survive for 2 years without sight, and therefore have forgotten how the world looked like it also all just looked...different...\n\nThis wasn't normal sight, I could see more. I could *physically* see more, like infra-red, and RADAR. My vision wasn't the typical 180\u00b0-ish view that you'd normally have either, it was far greater, more like 270\u00b0... I could also sense more. I not only knew that there was a wall behind me, I could also physically \"see\" the wall. I wouldn't exactly call it seeing, it's more like *sensing* its existence, and being aware it is behind me.\n\nI pulled away my white sheets, without a cover. In all these 2 years, I hadn't once noticed that I was sleeping under sheets without covers. When I actually looked at my legs though, I found that something had changed... These were not the legs that I remember. It looked like an endoskeleton. I could see pistons, cables, pneumatic and hydraulic tubing. Some pistons were still moving like muscle twitches. The bones weren't bone either, however they weren't metal either. It was hard, but didn't look like any metal I knew.\n\nUpon further inspection, I noticed that my hands, chest and arms were like my legs too. My hands had cables connecting each finger, with a winch-like servo behind each finger. My hands were oddly enough more \"developed\" than other parts, though. Same goes for my feet. Plates that were separated by a small gap covered my feet and hands. I looked in the mirror, and my head was likewise robotic looking. It lacked many human features. The only human feature was its shape. The face was split into four plates, all disconnected from one another. They were moving about every now and then, as if allowing something inside the head to move, and then the piece would move back again. In the middle was a single sphere. It was glowing reddish orange, and remained fixed. After inspecting myself, I decided to go outside, and see what changed.\n\nI opened the door anxiously, expecting people to go crazy when they see an intimidating robot suddenly walk out their neighbor's door. To my surprise, no one reacted. Was I the only one who could see? I looked around and noticed that everyone seemed to have changed. Some seemingly slower than others. It seemed I was the most \"developed\". With a complete head, and plating around the hand, feet, face, ankles, and parts of the chest. Most people didn't yet even have the glowing red eye in the middle of their head.\n\nThe world outside was a mess. Cars were still all over the place, wrecked. Some upside down, some wrecked beyond recognition. Some of them looked like they recently burned. It was as if this just happened... \"Curious\" I thought. I opened my phone, only to see that what we *perceived* as 2 years, was in reality 6 months. I walked around the city. There were several strange things around. Things such as massive metal stalks coming out of the ground. Most of the foliage seems to have taken over the city, and are secreting some strange green gas that's heavier than air. \"Has it really been just 6 months?\" I thought to myself. It seemed our blindness has accelerated our perception of time. Made sense, since sleeping does the same thing. I walked to the port, only to find 3 massive container ships crashed on the shore. I could still hear the screeching of metal, and the bending of it. One of the dock cranes was still standing. There was a large container suspended from it. I could hear the tension in the wire and crane from all the way down here.\n\nI went back home, and went to sleep. I was still quite unused to my new metal body. When I woke up the next morning, I noticed that the rest of my body is now covered in plates. Plates similar to those on my hands and feet. \"Are these biological? It's clearly not normal metal. It's not like there's some stranger putting these on, is it?\" I thought, and chuckled a little. Then, from the corner of my eye, I saw a black silhouette, then suddenly disappear, followed by a voice echoing from down the stairs, \"Don't tell them you can see!\" Followed by a muffled scream.",

            "comment": "When Xavier\u2019s world changed, it started with fire.\n\nBurning tore through his head and he screamed. Flames licked at his skull, building behind his nose and eyes until he thought he might die. He fell to the floor, hands connecting painfully with the loose stones. He felt the knees of his trousers tear and warm blood began to trickle down his leg.\n\nWhen the second assault on his mind came, he screamed again. Rolling over, he buried the palms of his hands into his eye-sockets, desperate to force out the agony. And then it was gone. Where the pain had been, now was colour. It swirled and twisted and exploded into clouds of dust that settled in every corner of his mind. He shook his head, confused and suddenly afraid. He had never seen such colours before. The black he had been born into had been home for so long.\n\nHe tried to focus on one of the colours, it was bright and magnificent. As he stared at it, it quickly morphed into yet another colour. He wondered if they had names, if anybody had ever seen such beautiful sights.\n\nAnd then he vomited. It happened so quickly he had no time to prepare. He felt it splash onto his hands and he grimaced before wiping them on his jacket. Crawling onto his hands and knees, he prepared himself to vomit once again. But it never came. Instead he felt pain building once more behind his eyes and clenched his jaw, balling and unbaling his hands into fists in nervous anticipation. Slowly the colours started to form again, but they were duller this time. Different somehow. He tried to focus on what was different about them when realisation hit him.\n\nThe colours weren\u2019t in his mind. They were real.\n\nHe cried out, scrambled back across the floor on the palms of his hands, feet scuffing at the rocks. He closed his eyes, focused on calming his breathing. And then he opened them again. The dark was gone. In front of him was a grey and decaying barrier. Rising to his feet, he approached it gingerly and reached out his hand. Fingers brushed against similar bumps and cracks. \u201cThe wall.\u201d The words left his mouth before he could stop them.\n\nThe wall was dull and crumbling and quite the most beautiful thing in the world. Something caught Xavier\u2019s eye and he moved towards it. Big, bold shapes had been painted onto the wall. He squinted, wondering at their purpose. And then he saw similar shapes on the floor. The ceiling too had the same lines and angles. He spun around quickly. They were everywhere.\n\nXavier felt his heart begin to hammer inside his chest and he took a step back. His foot caught on a stone and he rolled. He struck the floor hard and groaned.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell them you can see.\u201d\n\nHis head jerked and he saw a shape standing in the doorway. The light was behind the person and Xavier instinctively held up a hand to stop the stray beams from hurting his eyes.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he said quietly.\n\nThe figure stepped inside and crouched in front of him. It was a woman, he quickly realized. High cheekbones, narrow nose and oval chin. Xavier had felt many faces like that when his parents were teaching him to live with his blindness.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he repeated, firmer this time.\n\nWithout a word the woman reached out a hand. Xavier took it and found himself being pulled to his feet with surprising strength.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell them you can see,\u201d the woman repeated.\n\n\u201cThem? Who?\u201d Xavier asked, confused.\n\nStill holding his hand, the woman half-pulled, half-lead Xavier to the empty doorframe. \u201cThem.\u201d She nodded her head in the direction she wanted Xavier to look.\n\nXavier squinted. The light outside was blinding and he found his eyes watering. It took him some moments to adjust to the world. When he did, he gasped.\n\nOutside the small town was teeming with people. Many were hard at work harvesting crops or washing clothes. Xavier even thought he recognised a few from the sounds of voices and laughter that carried through the air.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the people that had caused Xavier\u2019s heart to skip a beat. In and among the people walked something else. He focused on one of the creatures. It was dark, incredibly so. And tall, taller than almost all the humans. And then it spoke.\n\nXavier couldn\u2019t hear the words, but he realised to his horror that he recognised the voice. \u201cRolf!\u201d\n\nThe woman beside him scowled. \u201cAye.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAye. Our town leader isn\u2019t even human.\u201d She shook her head as she spoke.\n\nPaint began to flow up Xavier\u2019s fingers and he realised he was digging his nails into the hard word of the broken doorframe. He pulled his hand away.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d His voice was weak and he coughed, clearing his throat.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nXavier shook his head and ran back across the room. \u201dWhat the hell is this. What is happening!\u201d\n\n\u201cShush man! You want to get us both killed?\u201d She followed him inside.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Xavier demanded again, forcing himself to appear calmer. He could feel his breathing coming in short, sharp breaths and as the woman spoke, he focused on slowing the rise and fall of his chest.\n\n\u201cAliens,\u201d she said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. \u201cDunno the full story myself really. I only know they blinded us. But not all of us, as you can see.\u201d She smiled at her own joke and then gestured around the room.\n\n*Don\u2019t tell them you can see.* Xavier remembered and suddenly he realised what the large symbols on the walls meant.\n\n\u201cWho wrote this?\u201d Xavier asked, afraid he might not like the answer.\n\n\u201cThe resistance. Of which you are now one. It\u2019s written in a shade of red. Aliens can\u2019t see it apparently.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlow down,\u201d Xavier nearly shouted the words. \u201cWhat do you mean the resistance? I\u2019m not a part of anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are Xavier, because now you can see. So you\u2019re either with us or you\u2019re dead. You have until I leave this room to figure out which option you want.\u201d\n\nXavier leaned against the wall and slid his body down it. He folded is head into his hands and let out a string of curses. Finally, he looked up at the woman, who stood staring disinterestedly at him whilst chewing on a large, bright apple.\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d he said at last.\n\nShe smiled, lips lifting to reveal round, white teeth. \u201cWelcome to the resistance, Xavier.\u201d",

            "comment": "It was darkness, like everyone just vanished in an instant. Like, you were suddenly caged up and isolated in your black space. And then the news came. After hearing everyone was blinded and alone in their darkness, people started to feel less alone. You never really got used to it even after 2 years. Neither did anyone. Or maybe they did. And maybe you were really in that void all by yourself.\n\nWhen one's sight is lost, their other senses awaken. Well, you're not sure how true that is for you, you've only improved on your hearing. Regardless, that's what they say. People have apparently started to name smells and tastes like they are colors and they can describe the intricate details of the senses their surroundings give off. For you who only felt like everything got louder though, it has been harder to sleep and easier to wake up. You don't need to set an alarm in the morning now, the sound of the tram passing trough the next street gets you up six in the morning whether you like it or not.\n\nThe sound of trembling rails. You saw a window in a 90 degrees rolled perspective. And there was a sentence written on the other side of the window. \"\u0258\u0258\u01a8 n\u0252\u0254 \u03c5o\u03b3 m\u0258\u029c\u0248 ll\u0258\u0248 \u0248no\u10a7\" It was hard to read with the perspective of the image in front of you combined with the sentence looking reversed from this side of the window. You focused your vision to read the sentence.\n\nWhat surprised you wasn't the image in front of you. In fact, you believed it could have just been a picture you imagined. On the other hand, the darkness that vanished in front of your eyes was far more shocking. That's when the meaning of the sentence in front of you dawned on you. It was a bizarre thing to believe, but whatever you did, you could not bring back the unending darkness. It was gone and it didn't matter whether you closed your eyes or not because you knew no matter what, you could open your eyes and see the window and the writing, lying sideways on your bed.\n\nYou thought you should be happy that you can see. But you didn't.\n\nYou instead felt as lonely as the time you lost your sight two years ago.\n\nAnd you had to keep it a secret? What a bother.",

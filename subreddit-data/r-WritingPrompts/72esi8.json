I just don't want to see our daughter crying on Christmas,\" I said as I climbed into bed and pulled the string to turn off the bedside lamp.\n\n\"She'll understand.\" I hoped she would. Last year we got her a puppy and made her the happiest girl in the neighborhood. But she can't have everything she wants. She'll understand.\n\n--\n\n*\"Daddy! Daddy!\"*, my daughter screamed, jumping and pulling on the covers of our bed. I squinted my eyes open. The clock next to the bed said 7:06 AM.\n\n\"What is it, baby?\", my wife asked groggily.\n\n*\"Pony! Pony! The front yard!\"* My eyes shot open. I got out of bed and rushed down the flight of stairs to the front door. I twisted the brass lock and flung the wooden frame open.\n\nIn the middle of our front walk was a horse with a crimson red coat and fire flowing from his nostrils with every exhale. It was tied to a stake on the right side of the lawn. The yard was covered with a light blanket of snow save for a patch of burnt grass where the horse was breathing onto. My daughter ran and jumped towards the hellish beast and hugged its front right leg with unadulterated excitement.\n\n*\"Can I name him, daddy?\"*, she asked eagerly. I had no response. I looked down by my feet at a package addressed to my daughter. The return address said 'Lucy'. I opened the package, atop of which was a letter.\n\n\"Dear Kayla,\n\nThank you for the letter. It sounds to me like your parents really don't want you to have a pony. Lucky for them, this isn't a pony. Enjoy the stallion.\n\n-Satan\n\nP.S. In this package you also received a small fire extinguisher. You will need it. Have your parents show you how to use it.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nedit: grammar",

She may need to do some things for Satan, though. But she could become a superhero! And then need to fight fires in Hell. But luckily, she got GOOD at fighting fires. At a price... ",

It's still on fire, at which point you should use another extinguisher, if it is readily available and the fire is small enough, or evacuate the area as your efforts were in vain. \n\n2. The fire is out. Congratulations! Stare at it for the next half hour to make sure it doesn't reignite, then return the empty extinguisher to the safety office and prepare to fill out a small novels worth of paperwork.

            "comment": "It's barely ass o'clock in the morning and there's a tiny human pouncing on my chest screaming something about the front yard. Lovely... What could she possibly want to show me at this hour of morning? I bet it's snow, I bet she's excited by snow... Yeah, that's it.\n\nI send the child to find her outdoor clothes as I drag myself out of bed.  Bathrobe in hand I demand my husband join me. \"If I have to be up, so do you.  Come on princess, the kid wants to show us something.\"\n\nI throw open the front door and to my utter shock there's an obsidian stallion grazing in the yard, picking from spots where the snow melted exposing the bare ground around its flaming hooves.  I shut the door, turning to my husband and sighing. \"Honey, did you spell check our dear daughter's letter to Santa?\"\n\n\"No, why? She typed it up all by herself. She knows how to use spell-check.\" came the passive reply. \n\nI lazily throw open the front door, letting the kid out onto the porch and letting my husband marvel at the majestic armored horse in our front yard.  \"Be careful! Don't get close to it!\" screams my husband, grabbing onto our daughter's shoulder.  The steed looks up inquisitively before snorting hot breath and going back to grazing.  \n\nI sigh again, \"It's docile\" I reassure him.  I wander up to the creature, one hand out, palm up, and it sniffs at me once before deciding I'm safe.  I slowly pet the side of its neck, noting that it's unusually warm to the touch but not uncomfortably hot.  Calling back to my still-in-shock husband, \"What does the package by the door say?\"\n\nQuickly collecting up the box, I use the distraction to call over the kid and introduce her to the horse. It seems to like her immediately and dips its head down offering to let her scamper up on its back.  \"It's a 'Thank You' note\" he starts, removing a modestly large bright red apple from the box before reading \"whosoever feeds it the apple becomes its master until death\", he pales immediately. \n\n\"What's the matter dear?\" I ask, walking back to the porch to collect the apple and the note. Meanwhile, the kid is now fully on the beast's back, holding onto two large protrusions from its shoulders as if they're handles.  The creature doesn't seem to mind the child at all as she pets its armor-covered neck.\n\nI glance over the letter, immediately realizing what my kid managed to do. She got bit by auto-correct. Apparently this year, Satan is Santa. Oh well, no mind.  According to the letter it doesn't need to eat and generally just munches grass when its bored.  Seems like a pretty decent deal - the kid gets a pony and I get a living lawnmower slash weed-eater. I'm somehow okay with this deal.  It might take some convincing for my husband though.\n\nHad I known it was that easy to get a Dreadsteed of Xoroth I would have saved myself the grind and just written a letter!  When I was a kid I had to grind mine the hard way, summoning one myself then taming the damned thing.  My kid just writes a letter and *poof* wish granted.\n\nI hand the kid the apple and nudge her hand toward the horse's mouth.  It sniffs once, its eyes glow brighter with excitement and the apple gets munched right out of the kid's hand.  The kid is delighted, her father is horrified, and the beast seems to enjoy prancing about the yard.\n\nI gently direct the kid-laden horse toward the back gate, \"Go take your new friend to the back yard so it doesn't scare the neighbors. Wouldn't want this to end up in tomorrow's paper, would we?\" That takes care of the kid and gets the flaming pony out of public view. Now I need to do some adult damage-control.\n\n\"But its hooves are on fire!\" Yes, yes, got that part... That's really the only thing that threw you off about a dreadsteed?  Not the horns?  Or the armor plating growing out of its neck?  No, you're fixated on the flaming hooves...\n\n\"Perhaps it's time we have a discussion about why your side of the family doesn't talk to my side of the family after the wedding...\" Oh this is going to be a great conversation.  \"Or why we generally don't get random visits from my side of the family?\"  How do I approach this without breaking him?  \"It wasn't a typo on the wedding seating chart, or on the RSVP list, or really anywhere at all dearest.\" Another sigh. I feel like there's going to be a lot more of those to come in the next few days. \"In fact I'm honestly shocked he managed to keep his behavior civil throughout the event.\" I drape my hand over my face.  I'm getting off topic, he's going to notice I'm stalling... \"My grandfather's name isn't *Samuel*, it's *Samael*.\"",

            "comment": "One of my favorite sounds in the world is the happy laughter or squealing from my daughter. Unfortunately right now I couldn't enjoy it because I was struck dumb by the object of her happiness. In the front lawn stood a pony, or a horse I never quite could the difference sometimes, and I had no idea why it was there much less how. It was a beautiful animal, glossy black coat with a fiery red mane. Yet something seemed off. It's eyes glowed with an eerie yellow light that belied a hidden intelligence. That and it breathed fire that melted patches of snow, those were really odd traits. \n\nSo enthralled by the sight I didn't stop my daughter from running out the door. She ran straight to the pony and threw her arms around its neck, hugging it tightly laughing happily. Thankfully the horse didn't breathe fire on her, if anything it looked like it enjoyed the attention and nuzzled her back. \n\n\"Stephen...what on Earth...\" my wife gasped at the sight, wrapping herself in her bathrobe. \"Where did that...pony...come from?\"  \n\nI shook my head in disbelief and when I took a step forward my foot hit a package on the stoop. I bent over and picked it up, huffing at the weight and looked curiously at the old fashioned writing on the brown paper covering. \"Maybe this will have some answers. Alice sweetie,\" I called to my daughter, \"Why don't you come back and out on some warmer clothes. Then you can lead the...pony to the back yard okay?\"\n\nShe grinned through her happy tears and nodded. She patted the pony's neck and raced back inside stopping only to hug her mother and I. Squealing thanks she changed at light speed and ran back out. The pony waited patiently and followed her like a trained dog into the back yard. Thankfully here in the country we had the room for animals and it was soon running happily around, being chased and playfully chasing back Alice who shrieked with glee. \n\nWe stood in the warm house, watching an almost perfectly normal scene play out before us. I opened the package and drew forth an old fashioned sheaf of parchment paper, heavy and also written on with old fashioned hand writing. The rest of the package was a heavy red bound leather book, a comb made of dark stone, and some leads and bridles. I started to read the letter, eyes widening in shock. My hands shook as I read and soon my wife saw my expression. \n\n\"Stephen. What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Well, remember what I told Alice to do a few weeks ago?\" My voice trembled lightly as I spoke. \n\n\"Of course. To write to Santa for a pony. I wonder who the generous Santa is. And where on earth did he find that...pony.\" \n\n\"Well....maybe it's more safe to say the pony was found under the earth.\"\n\nShe looked at me, eyebrow curling with confusion. \"What does that mean?\"\n\nI coughed hesitantly. \"Well. Apparently we should have read Alice's letter a little more carefully. She uh, didn't write to Santa so much as...\" I handed her the letter. \n\nShe took it from me and started to read. \"SATAN?!\" she practically shrieked as she read the top part. She looked at me as if begging me to say it was a joke and I motioned for her to continue, mind reeling from what I read. \n\n*To Mr and Mrs Greyfax. I do want to thank you for allowing Alice to write to me. She has lovely penmanship for her age and as you might imagine I don't receive as much pleasant mail. Don't you worry. This pony is a very docile breed and will not grow much larger than it is. It eats mortal fodder much like its terrestrial cousins and is generally a well behaved animal. I made sure to pick the nicest one in the herd. Of course there will need to be some training but I imagine Alice is up to the task. I enclosed some things for the pony as well as a book on care.*\n\nMy wife's eyes were as round as saucers and she looked at me fearfully. I could only hug her close as she continued to read. *Also I cleared things with Santa as well as God. They thought her letter was very nice as well and give their blessings in letting her have a Hell pony. Also don't worry. This doesn't constitute an act of satanism. It's a Christianly act to be so pleasant and understanding and I have no problems rewarding such outstanding behavior. You are a credit to her behavior as fine parents. If you have any questions do feel free to send a letter. Merry Christmas!*\n\nWe stood and stared at the letter, half expecting it to burst into flames or do something equally horrid or supernatural. Nothing happened and we just looked at the cheery signature of *Lucifer, also known as the devil/Satan*.\n\nWe gazed out the window and continued to watch Alice romp around in the snow with the Hell pony, laughing with delight as it huffed hot air at her, melting the snow.  \"Wha-what do we do?\" my wife asked, voice filled with wonder. \n\n\"I guess keep the pony as long as Alice takes good care of it.\" My reply felt too normal for the situation and we chuckled at the strangeness of things. \"And...maybe send a thank you note? What do you get him back for a present?\"",

You call it Mister Pibbles?\"\n\n\"Actually, my daughter named him. He was kind of a Christmas present. It's really kind of a funny story, although maybe not in this room, at this particular...\"\n\n\"Is it dangerous?\"\n\n\"Oh god yes,\" I answered before I really had time to think. Then I had to try and backtrack. \"I mean, he's always potentially dangerous, but so are big dogs, right? He wouldn't hurt family, and he shouldn't be a danger to random strangers as long as he's got his soul bag on...\"\n\nI kind of trailed off at that point, worried that some bright spark in the HR department would ask me how I manage to fill a pony-sized feed bag full of human souls.\n\nFortunately, no one did.\n\n\"I'm really sorry about this, but can I just take him home?\"\n\nThe big boss spoke up, trying to maintain an air of authority, as his personal view of the universe crumbled quietly around him.\n\n\"I'm about this close to calling the police, or locking that thing up where it can't hurt anybody.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Bad idea. Very bad idea. Please do not interact with Mister Pibbles. Don't pet him, don't move him, and whatever you do, don't ASK HIM for anything! In fact, it's best if you don't wish for anything really specific when you're close to him. If he's feeling playful he might try to get it for you and we really do not want a repeat of the birthday kitten situation.\"\n\n\"How did you end up with this creature in the first place?\"\n\n\"Reading may be fundamental, sir, but proper spelling can save your soul.\"",

            "comment": "I yawned. \n\nAnother white snowed holiday of dissapointed wishes and stressful family visits. At least the food was good. I looked forward to (hehe) *chillin* today, watch some tv, help my wife clean up a bit. First things first. I need the mail. It didn't occur to me that because of the holiday the mail didn't come, but I felt compelled to get it. I opened the door, and the only thing there was a small red-stained note that looked like that old papyrus stuff in museums. On it was a red wax seal. Wrapped inside it was a normal letter, with childish scrawling on it. I recognized our return address on it. \n\nThere was a loud, bizarre neighing. Like a diseased monkey chortling. \n\nThen I saw it. \n\nIt looked like a pony. A nice pony. Little Sebastian brand pony. But... It had a long, spiked tail. \nAnd two red goat horns. \nAnd saber-toothed cat fangs. \nAnd crimson bat wings. \n\nA forked tongue writhed out and slithered back into the creature. \n\nI blinked. I sipped my coffee. I picked up the notes as closed the door. \n\nI reopened the door. It was still there. \n\nI opened the note. \nIt was written with beautiful yet harsh penmanship. The letters were iridescent, transitioning from black to gold. Each letter had a spear tip decal somewhere on it. It read; \n\"Hello Carol,\nThank you for your letter. We don't get letters here often, beyond wanted posters, which I regret I had to write on for this note. To make it special, I used one of our most famous posters.\"\n\nI looked at the back. There was a photo of a infamous face and a title which read \"WANTED Charles Manson\" I kept reading. \n\n\"To thank you for your letter, here is what you requested. A lovely pony named Princess. It took quite a lot to make something so cute, but I am happy with the result. She will be with you wherever you go Carol. Say 'Baal' and she will vanish into flame. Repeat the word to summon her back. Enjoy and please write again soon!\nSin-cerely,\nSatan\"\n\nI looked at the letter. I looked at my daughters letter wrapped in it. \"Satan Claws. North Pole.\"\n\nWe'd have to work on her spelling. \n\nI stood in disbelief for a moment. It suddenly made sense why the jolly elf wore red all the time. 'Princess' had walked up to me, evidently recognizing me as some member of her new owners family. Or at least I thought she was. Coulda been eyeing to eat my soul for all I know. \n\"Dear lord...\" I sighed. \nPrincess shrieked in disgust. \nI thought for a moment. \nI went back inside and called up the stairs. \"Carol! Come down here! There's a late present here for you!\"\nCarol groggily came to the stairs but when she realized what I said she giddily came galloping down. I went to the table and sat down. Amidst the happy shouts of Carol and confused screams of my wife I wrote a simple note:\n\n\"Satan, \nThank you for returning my daughters letter. If I may be so bold, attached is a list of people I kindly ask you to take care of as only you can after they pass...\"",

            "comment": "I stood dumbstruck by the sight in my front yard. A small black horse stood neighing and stamping it's hooves in the melting snow. When I say horse, it had blue flame in place of a mane and tail and as it stamped small flares leapt from it's hooves.\n\n\"Daddy, why is the pony on fire?\" My daughter's voice broke my frozen mind.\n\n\"Umm, honey, as much as I would love to give you an explanation on what a nightmare is right now, I am a little held up on the fact that I could have asked for one apparently years ago and I would have gotten one so please give daddy a moment to collect himself.\" I stared down at the letter that was left taped to the door specifically the sender line: Satan. \"Uhh, sweety can you tell me how to spell santa?\"\n\n\"S?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"A, t?\" I shook my head slightly.\n\n\"A, n?\" She finished and looked at me quizically.\n\nI shook my head again. \"Sorry honey, that's, that's not right.\"\n\n\"But that's what the letter says.\" She pouted.\n\n\"I know honey, but that's how you spell Satan.\"\n\n\"Ohhh.\" She giggled. \"S, a, n, t, a.\" She said proudly.\n\n\"Very good. When you sent your letter to Santa, did you check your spelling? Or were you too excited and just sent it?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry daddy.\" She pouted looking down.\n\n\"No, no it's not your fault. Okay let's, well actually you stay, I'll approach it.\" I stepped off the the porch and cautiously moved closer to the flaming horse. It turned to stare at me, small flames jetted from it's nostrils as it exhaled harshly. \"Hey there, little, guy.\" I reached out a hand to which it whinnied at shaking its head and backing up.\n\n\"Holy-\" My wife had apparently come to check on us. \"Umm, honey? What the hell is that?\"\n\n\"It's my pony!\" Our daughter answered cheerfully. \"It's from, from... Satan! That's what daddy said his name was.\"\n\nMy wife glared at me. \"Satan?\"\n\n\"No what I said, alright, the letter says it's from Satan. I told her to write a letter to Santa for the pony.\" I tried to explain. \"Well at least, *he* delivers.\" I half mumbled. My wife shot me another glare.\n\n\"I love Satan!\" Our daughter declared loudly. I looked at my daughter and then back to my wife before bursting into laughter. My wife attempted to maintain her glare but soon failed joining me in a laugh. As I attempted to regain my composure I felt a sudden heat on my back and a blue fireball shot past my shoulder. I fell to the ground and crawled backward putting distance again between me and the nightmare, my daughter giggled at me.\n\n\"Hey what's this package?\" My wife asked. She tore open the sides and removed the contents. There was a black leather-like lead and a note:\n\n*Dear Eliza,*    \n*I thank you for the letter, it is rare for me to receive one of its kind. I hope my gift to you is an acceptable one, I agree with your father that everyone should have fun in their life, that a fantasy is something to hope for. I do hope you enjoy this element of fantasy I have granted you. Inside is a lead suitable for ponies of his kind, I believe your father is capable of explaining to you enough about a nightmare for you to properly care for him.*    \n*With regards, your friend,*    \n*Satan*\n\n*P.S. He loves apples.*\n\nMy wife read the letter outloud and looked up at me, I could tell she was as lost as I was. \"Umm, Elly, how about we try and take your new pony to the back so he doesn't surprise anyone else.\"\n\n\"Ok.\" She skipped down the porch and to her pony. \"C'mon Blue.\" She waved her hand to the pony motioning to it to follow. It stood still staring with its deep red eyes at her.\n\n\"Oh!\" My wife called out. \"He sent an apple along.\" She looked genuinely approving. She tossed the apple to me and I stood up waving the apple in its face. It began to neigh and quickly followed.\n\n\"Wait!\" Eliza yelled. \"I wanna do it.\" She whined. I handed her the apple and she called to it making a snapping sound with her tongue. She took it through the gate and into the backyard.\n\nMy wife hurried down the steps. \"What the hell are we supposed to do with that?\"\n\n\"How should I know, I don't exactly think it comes with a return to sender address.\" I replied.\n\n\"Well anything else this Christmas you asked Satan to make real from your books?\" She mocked.\n\n\"Hey, I didn't ask for that, Eliza asked for a pony, I said write a letter to *Santa*.\"\n\n\"Well how the hell did he know that quote from your book?\"\n\n\"I don't know, maybe he's a fan.\"\n\n\"Nice explanation, hey now it's my turn I'm gonna go write a letter to *Santa*.\" She gestured quotations in the air, mocking me. \"I want magic like Cassie's.\"\n\n\"Nice choice, I love you.\" I laughed. \"Real quick though can we talk about the fact that we're openly discussing Satan like it's normal accepted conversation?\"\n\n\"No.\" She replied simply. \"We've got a flaming horse in our backyard.\" She smiled and pointed over to the gate where our daughter was leading her *pony* in circles.\n\n\"Have I mentioned I *really* love you.\"\n\n\"You better. We can worry more about if the Devil is real later, for now let's worry about our daughter who's alone in the yard with her fiery pony.\"\n\n\"Daddy!\" My daughter screamed. \"Blue sneezed and the bush is on fire!\"\n\nI headed through the gate over to the small flame slowly heading down the branch. \"Yeah, *you're* gonna need to teach him to *not* do that.\"\n\n_\n\n[R/TheoreticalFictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoreticalFictions)",

            "comment": "I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but it's hardly sane to act like I'm not.\n\n\"Steven, seriously, I don't know anything about it,\" I lied as he shook a neatly wrapped package closer toward my face.\n\n\"SATAN,\" his voice pitched up, \"it says it's from Satan, ***honey***, and we can't call the police why?! What kind of sick prank is this, to send a little girl...that.. that MONSTER!? What even is it, why does this cockadoodle stuff keep hapening to us!? I can't anymore with this...with YOU! Jesus...\"\n\n\"Oh, calm down ***Steve***,\" I managed to snatch the package away from him before he stormed off petulantly to hide in the bathroom, and scream into a towel.\n\nIt was the coping mechanism of a coward. And well, I guess I'm a liar, but with the way he hid from everything it didn't exactly make it easy to be honest.\n\nI could hear Penny crying in the livingroom as I made my way back down the hall from our bedroom. She tried to hide it when I sat next to her on the couch, but it hardly made a difference with how red her cheeks had gotten.\n\n\"This one's for me,\" I sat the package down on the coffee table, \"but do you wanna open it?\"\n\nShe looked up at me with the usual skepticism she had when I was doing something her step dad disagreed with. \n\n\"Go ahead,\" I gave her the smile that only we shared. The kind that said I didn't care if we got in trouble. We ARE trouble.\n\nShe didn't hesitate after that, and like all children quickly discarded the note for me to read.\n\n---\n\n\n**To: My Dearest Sarah, \"with an H\",*\n\n*First, my apologies. I may have committed an itsy bitsy little federal crime by sending someone to change the spelling on Pen's address line, my bad. To be fair, you were the one trying to trick her into writing, \"Santa\"- like that obese old blowhard would actually bring her anything.* \n\n*Anyway, you know I can't pass up such a convincing, and frankly, well written letter. The way she so eloquently made her argument- she really is your kid, huh? Bet you're just- oh, how did you always put it, \"proud as a opossum\"?*\n\n*So, I'm guessing average ole' steady job Steve is already in the crapper feeling sorry for himself about this whole situation (which is, by the way, why only you and Pen can see the letter). Anyway, tell him to stick a thumb in it. Penny earned this one. Straight A's all year, and the way she told off that self righteous little nose picker bully tormenting her best bud, she's something special. No wonder she doesn't get along with that white bread, economy car driving, watches the news for fun, Steven. What, with his fetish for bland food, and dry conversation, and all.*\n\n*Honestly, I can't remember why you think you enjoy being around him? (...Yeah yeah, not my place, I know.) Anyway, give Pen a hug for me, and tell her the nightmare's name is 'Hank', and it's non-negotiable (seriously, that's all she'll answer to).*\n\n*Warmest Regards,*\n\n***Luci***\n\n---\n\n\nI couldn't help but hold my hand over my growing smile as I read it. There was something, I dunno, endearing about Lucifer being doating. Of him being jealous. Over Steven of all people- who, yes, was still in the bathroom.\n\nPenny was watching me, hopefully clutching the contents of the package- a key, \" there's a tag.\" She handed it over to me with a sly smile.\n\n--*For: Sarah. Don't think I forgot about you! And, don't forget, my offer always stands. Merry Xmas -Luci*--\n\n\"What's it go to?\" Penny returned our secret smile. A crooked, cute, little challenge.\n\n\"I'm sure it's gonna be trouble,\" I smirked back.\n\n\"Does that mean I can keep...\" Pen furrowed her brow, \"hmm, what should we call her.\"\n\n\"Her name is Hank,\" I turned to look at the nightmare whose fiery breath was fogging up the window her face was pressed against just enough to obscure her unsettling gaze, \"apparently it's non-negotiable. So, yeah, we can keep her. I'll deal with Steve.\"\n\nAs Penny started to do jubilant laps around the house, and out the door into the snow (leaving it wide open), I ran my thumb over the ornate brass key. Thinking of how it reminded me of my promise, the deal with The Devil. Not to mention that offer of his.\n\nI guess it was alright for him to spoil Pen, first born and all, because of me she was kinda his too one way or another. \n\nI'd always thought he'd gotten an unfair shake, Satan, that is. He kept his promises, and he'd always been good to Pen. Good to me. What could it hurt to take him up on his offer, really? It was just a cup of coffee after all. Not a marriage proposal. \n\nMy mind turned to the divorce papers that I'd already filled out waiting on the top shelf in my closet. \n\n\"Hey Pen, come and get dressed in something with short sleeves,\" I ushered her back into the house, Hank following us right to the edge of the threshold, \"I think we gotta go see someone you owe a big, 'thank you' to for your present.\"\n\nPlus, I'd say I've earned a little trouble.\n\n",

I received her letter, and I figured this would be the easiest option for you. To turn it into it's more portable shape simply squeeze the snout twice. May you and Sally have a Merry Christmas, Love Lucifer 'Luke' \" I said dragging out the last sentence hoping by some chance of fate it could last longer the embarrassment palpable.\n\nThe dark lord continued to glare at me \"Well what do you have to say?\" he said looking me straight in the eyes, staring into my twisted soul \"I'm sowwy\" I said trying to act cute but the glare continued as I seized up for a moment before bowing \"This humble servant apologizes, Oh lord of sin, if I have displeased you I shall sacrifice myself in hopes to gain your forgiveness and favor\" I said grabbing the ceremonial dagger holding it to my throat a few red drops dripping into the cauldron.\n\nThe pale man looked contemplative \"Hmm maybe you should, you were quite disrespectful\" he said as I balked \"Really Luke? Suicide for not reading a card?\"\n\n\"Maybe\" he said with an impish smile.\n\nI sighed \"Fine, oh great lord please accept my sacrifice\"I said sarcastically as I started to pull the blade, but as expected it dissipated from my hands, appearing in his.\n\n\"I'll forgive you this once, but start reading cards. It's rude not to at least take a quick peek. Didn't your mother ever teach you that?\" he asked shaking the tip of the dagger toward my direction\n\n\"No my mother was too busy teaching me to love Satan, I suppose the lesson took too well\" I said flatly looking away but a slight smile showed on the edge of my lips.\n\n\"I suppose so\" he said chuckling \"So did Sally like the pony? I chose the best colt in my stables.\"\n\nI smiled rolling my eyes \"Yes your daughter loves her new pony, is that what you wanted to hear?\" I said barely holding back a laugh as his face lit up \"But next time tell me about these things, I think Old Lady Gibson next door had a heart attack when it lit her bushes on fire.\" I said smirking\n\nLuke groaned \"Don't remind me, the old bitch has been complaining nonstop since she got here. 'It's too hot' 'Where's my tea' 'What do you mean killing abortion doctors don't get you to heaven?', Just bitch, bitch, bitch.\" he said looking over his shoulder \"Well I need to get going tell Sally I'm glad she likes her present\"\n\n\"Will do, I'll also make sure to sacrifice a couple lambs later. I know you prefer that to virgin. I love you Luke, Give em hell today\" I said giggling as he his eyes rolled so hard they nearly left his skull \"Every call you have to end with that\" he said but smiled \"Love you too, let me know if the Buttercup burns anything else, I'll make sure one of my constituents sends you a check\" he said the cauldrons surface going murky.\n\nI giggled \"That man, always spoiling his little Antichrist\" I said softly to myself as I went to go find Sally and Buttercup. I needed to make sure I taught her how to stow her new horse away, I doubt the school would be pleased if she started riding it to school.",

            "comment": "It was a joke between them. Every year Luna would ask for a pony and every year her dad Lou would tell her to write Santa. Luna was seventeen now and in a bit of a rebellious stage. Going to parties, getting drunk, doing who knows what with her boyfriend Dylan. Every conversation between father and daughter ended in an argument.\n\nThings had gotten better between Luna and Lou recently though after Dylan and Luna had broken up. He had been expelled from the local high school after spray painting rainbow coloured penises on the walls outside the gym. When they stopped seeing each other every day things kind of just fizzled out between them.\n\nThis was a few months before christmas and Lou had really thought things were getting better between them. They had been watching a T.V talent show together for the last few weeks -every Saturday. Lou knew that if she had just wanted to watch the show she could have caught the highlights on YouTube. \n\nOne Saturday she brought up the pony joke again. And like every year he told her to write Santa. Luna's mother Abigail rolled her eyes fondly at them and took another sip of her wine. \n\nLuna grabbed the notepad on the kitchen counter that they used for writing down the grocery list.\n\nAfter they had finshed watching the show Lou looked at the note and saw that Luna had addressed it to 'Satan' and not 'Santa' but he shrugged his shoulders. Luna had also had some wine with her dinner so he thought that he probably didn't have to worry that she was secretly a satanist. Laughing at his own thoughts he went to bed.\n\n------\n\nIt wasn't until christmas morning that Lou realised he had reason to worry. There was a frumpy little pony in the backyard. It wasn't very impressive -something that would entertain kids at a birthday party or something. What was more concerning was that it was breathing fire and huffing out billowing grey clouds like a chain smoker.\n\n\"What's this?\" He asked Luna.\n\n\"My pony\" Luna said as she brushed its mane \"Satan got him for me.\"\n\n\"Satan?\" \n\n\"Yeah I told him about our joke and well, he has a pretty terrible sense of humour. Don't worry though dad, I'll get him to take him back after dinner.\"\n\nLou was worried though. \n\n\"Why were you talking to Satan?\" He asked trying to sound stern despite being dreadfully confused.\n\n\"I was talking to mum and she said that I could invite my new boyfriend to dinner -he's not very close to his family you see and I didn't want him to be alone on christmas.\" \n\n\"Boyfriend?!\"\n\n\"Yeah\" Luna looked bashful now \"Sorry I was going to tell you earlier but then Luce went and did this. His sense of humour is terrible but I just know that the two of you are going to get on like two peas in a pod. He helped me quit smoking you know.\"\n\n\"Smoking?!\" \n\nLou was glad the fridge was fully stocked with his favourite beer.",

How do kids hear things like that but not when I ask her to pick up her toys? A mystery that may never be solved. \n\nMy husband and I exchanged glances. Well, now what? We had a large enough yard, we could likely build a little stable and make it work. Lilith laughed as the pony nuzzled her hair, seemingly tame. I realized what terrible parents we were, standing there staring dumbstruck at the beast while our daughter petted and cooed at it, but the pony seemed harmless. Until it hiccuped a white hot jet of fire straight down into the snow, melting a two foot radius. Luckily, our dear Lily was clear of it but she screamed anyway.\n\nMy husband lit up, his eyes suddenly ablaze (pardon the pun). I knew that look. That look meant that he had an idea, one of his harebrained schemes like the time he decided it would add value to our house to put a bathroom in the basement. Two years later he had a few studs put in, a toilet not attached to anything in a corner and no future goals in mind.\n\n\"I know exactly what to do,\" he rubbed his hands together like a kid on Christmas. (Very fitting, given our current scenario.) \"We can train it to melt the driveway. I'll never have to plow again!\" \n\nIt's been three years since then and while my husband suffered a fairly significant burn that first year, it's been pretty smooth sailing with Dory. My husband likes to call her our \"Little Gift From Below,\" and whenever people ask us our secret to having such a perfectly cleared driveway, that's who he thanks. They think he means salt. We even have her stocking hanging on the mantle and while we haven't officially joined his church, Satan still sees fit to leave her lumps of sulphury flesh in there every Christmas.",

As I slowly backed up into the threshold of my house, I calmly but clearly said \"OK Google, what is Satan's return policy?\"  Without hesitation, my phone began to play the particularly annoying fiddle solo portion of \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" and as I gazed at the majestic beast in my yard charring my perfectly manicured St. Augustine grass, I suddenly wished I was Jewish.  \n\nMy stomach quickly turned as I caught a whiff of the roasting dog poop my daughter had promised me she picked up from the front yard.  I retreated into the house, grabbed supplies from the coat closet and kitchen, and headed back outside dragging my daughter behind me.  After calling Satan's steed over from the poop zone, I turned to my daughter and gave her some advice she could use for the rest of her life. I straightened two clothes hangers, placed marshmallows on each, and softly whispered to my daughter \"Sweetie, when life gives you a fire breathing pony from Satan, you make s'mores.\"",

Closing my eyes for a moment, I'd wished my wife was still around to share this beautiful winter morning with us. \"First Christmas without her,\" I'd thought sadly. I'd closed my eyes for a moment.\n\nMy thoughts had turned to our daughter. She was the most precious creature in the world to me, and I guard her like a lioness guards her cubs. I couldn't afford to let something or other take her away from me like a car accident ripped my wife away from us. I'd gone to check if she was awake, but she'd been staring out of the window at a crowd of neighbours pointing at our house and chattering among themselves. Some had their phones out, snapping away.\n\nNaturally I opened the front door with every intention to chase them away tactfully, but the minute I stepped outside, I saw the most unbelievable sight I had ever laid eyes upon.\n\nA fire-breathing, coal-black horse was stamping around my front yard, neighing and tossing its admittedly majestic mane about.\n\nThat was where I screamed in shock.\n\nAbby's eyes grew rounder and rounder. She displayed no sign of fear, though, which seemed more than a little odd. Finally she spoke. \"I think Santa made a mistake.\"\n\n\"Mistake? What? What's happening?\" I questioned her.\n\n\"You see, Daddy, remember when I told you I wanted a pony and you told me to write to Santa? I did write to him, but this isn't what I asked for. I wanted a black pony that breathes sparkles, with a rainbow mane. Something went wrong somewhere,\" she explained.\n\nAfter I somehow chased all the neighbours away, I awkwardly led the horse to the back yard where fewer people would likely see it. There was a small piece of paper tied to the horse's left ear, and I untied it.\n\nIts contents were as follows:\n\n\"Dear Abby,\n\nI think you must have made a mistake. We do not have glitter-spitting ponies with rainbow manes down here in Hell, but never let it be said the devil is so evil that he cannot grant happiness to a 5-year-old child. I did my best to find a suitable pony for you. This is one of our finest; in fact we were planning to use him for the Apocalypse, but I guess we'll have to change plans now. He's already broken in so you can have some fun right away without worrying about training and all that. Terribly sorry, of course, if you don't like him. But he's the best horse we could find in all of Hell's stables.\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\nYours Sincerely\nSatan\n\nP.S. This is the first time anyone's asked me to provide them a present for a holiday dedicated to my arch nemesis' birthday. I kindly request that you never do this again.\"\n\nUnderstanding cleared out the cloud of confusion in my brain as I read the note.\n\nAbby must've spelled Santa as Satan.\n\nI chuckled a little as I wondered what it would feel like to have to make someone happy on the birthday of someone whom you've rivalled your entire life.\n\n\"Come, Abby, let's give you some riding lessons...\"",

I turned on the kitchen sink and peered out the window to take another look.  It was still there, black as night, eyes red as a ginger in the sun.  It was breathing strongly, with each exhale releasing a small tuft of hellfire and smoke from its flaring nostrils.\n\nMabel had done some crazy things before, as all children do, but this one took the devil\u2019s cake.\n\nMabel? MABEL! She was still out there with that beast, and moving closer to it by the second!\n\nI raced back outside to see the creature resting on its knees, allowing Mabel to pet its pitch black snout.\n\n\u2018\u2019Mabel!

What the hell just happened?\n\n\u201cWell, that's the damnedest thing I ever saw!''\n\nIt was my neighbor, Bill, leaning over the fence that separated our yards.\n\n\u201cI've seen some nasty stallions in my time, and I reckon that one right there was up there with the worst of \u2018em.  Real shame how those horse girls get carried away sometimes,\u201d he muttered as he walked away.\n\nI fell to my knees. My little girl was gone.  I tried to think.\n\nI could call the police.\n\nNo, they'd never believe me.\n\nI could notify the Air Force.\n\nRiiiiight.  Be on the lookout for a small child riding on the back of a flying, fire-breathing pony.\n\nI looked at the spot where they had taken off from and something caught my eye.  It looked like a card lying on the ground inside one of the indents caused by the creature\u2019s hooves.  I stood up, walked over to it and picked it up.  It read:\n\n\u201cDEVIL PONIES \u2018N MORE: WE\u2019VE GOT A HELL OF A BARGAIN 4 U\u201d.\n\nNeedless to say, I was puzzled, as I flipped the card over.  The back read:  \u201cSATAN JONES, customer support representative. 555-HELL ext. 666\u201d\n\nWith no other options available, I dialed the number.\n\nA friendly-sounding automated greeting chimed in on the other line.  \u201cThank you for calling Devil Ponies \u2018N More, where we\u2019ve got a hell of a bargain for you 24/7!  If you know the extension of the customer support representative you\u2019d like to reach, please dial it now.\u201d\n\nI dialed \u201c666\u201d.\n\nAfter a brief ring, someone picked up. \n\n\u201cThis is Satan in customer support.

            "comment": "It was our 7th Christmas with the whole family, me, my husband, and our daughter. \n\nEver since Elly was able to talk, all she ever wanted was a pony. It seems cliche but she was determined. However, we couldn't afford a pony so always settled instead on giving her horse related items. The usual pony stuffed animals and stick horses. \n\nThen when this Christmas season rolled around I heard the spiel again on a pony. Of course hearing new facts as she learned more on horse and pony care.\n\n\"Dad, dad! Can I have a pony?\"\n\"Oh...I dunno honey, ponies are hard to ta-\"\n\"No! Dad! I can do it! I know some cheap recipes for horse food, and there are places where you can buy hey cheap! I can make a water trough from some buckets. And I will take good care of it every day!\"\n\nWell that take is new... I can't win this without breaking her heart.\n\n\"Here honey, why don't you just take some paper and try telling Santa about how you can handle a pony. Maybe he can get one for you?\" I say and give a nice smile. Her face lights up in realization. \n\n\"Oh YEAH!\" She says, running off to write to Santa.\n\nWell now it was Christmas Day and I was standing out in the snow in my flannel pajama pants and a concert t shirt from The Police, staring at a jet black horse with bright orange hooves and a red, yellow, orange mane and tail. He was tacked up with a black leather saddle and bridle. He huffed smoke from his nostrils but didn't seem to breathe fire. He did melt the snow around his hooves showing that he did throw some heat. \n\n\"Vance, what the fuck is that?\" My husband hushed out in amazement at the creature.\n\n\"Heh, I don't know, but it's something.\" Suddenly I hear a high pitch squeal an all of us, including the pony, look over to see our daughter jumping in excitement.\n\" ITS A PONY!! SANTA GOT ME A MAGIC FIRE PONY!!!\" She yelled and ran to the horse to give it a hug. \n\nThe pony is oddly not spooked by this and just lets it happen. It's only then I spot a brown scroll strung to the saddle's horn. I walk over an pull it off. I open the scroll to see some writing in a large, scribbled cursive.\n\n\"Dear Mr. And Mr. -------,\nI would like to thank you for the lovely letter I deck from your daughter. She was very kind, and determined for a pony. I am aware that this letter was meant for my friend St. Nicholas and not me, but sadly, Santa doesn't give ponies out for Christmas. Your daughter is so kind hearted that i couldn't bear to break her heart. So I decided to give her one of my \"hell horses\". Don't worry though. As this one happened to have a type of dwarfism, causing it to not grow larger than this and giving it the inability to breathe fire. He eats any edible item for humans and doesn't require water. The saddle and bridle he is equipped with will shift into any style she wants. The only possibly troubling thing would be making sure that the other kids don't get jealous. Anyways I hope she likes her pony, she really deserves it. You guys are amazing parents for raising such a kind sweetheart. \n\nMuch regards,\nLucifer the fallen angle\n\nP.S. This guy won't cost you or your daughter anything\"\n\n\"Well...\" my husband said after reading the letter over my shoulder.\n\n\"I guess we have to keep him.\" I finished for him. I smiled, turned and kissed his cheek. \n\n\"Hey Elly!\" I said, trying to get her attention from the horse. \n\"Can you climb on your pony for a picture?\" I say, pulling my phone from my pocket. She nods and climbs on top of the saddle, I watch as it shrinks to her size and turns to her favorite color: purple. I smile and ask,\n\"So what are you gonna name him?\" \n\"Midnight\" she says with a grin.\n\"Alright everyone say Midnight!\" I say. Suddenly before the picture snaps, the horse leaps up and strikes a pose with Elly still on his back. She is laughing so much, she truly looks happy.\n\n\n\nAuthor's note: I had a Webkinz hell horse named midnight when I was around 7-9. If I can find a link to it I will. But otherwise that is what I based this horse off of, which I think is a nice little touch. :D\n\nHope you enjoyed! Criticism is welcome and happily accepted.",

            "comment": "\u201cDid you enjoy your Christmas?\u201d Reggie asked his daughter, Anne. She sat amongst the piles of shredded wrapping paper, boxes and tissue paper with a sullen look on her small face. Her golden curls bounced around her pouting face as she shook her head. When those bright blue eyes met his, he knew instantly what she was thinking.\n\n\u201cYou know Santa couldn\u2019t fit a pony into his sleigh.\u201d He said. Anne\u2019s eyes began to glitter with the promise of tears.\n\n\"He has a strict \"no animals policy\u201d.\u201d Marie, her mother spoke up, squeezing Reggie\u2019s hand reassuringly. The subject of a pony for Christmas had been a big issue for Anne this year and Marie knew how much it killed Reggie not to give his little girl everything she asked for but a pony was just outside of their realm. A housing development in the suburbs of Philadelphia is not a place for ponies. They tried to placate Anne with the promise of riding lessons after the New Year but that didn\u2019t soften the blow or the little girl\u2019s insistence on obtaining an equine friend.\n\nAs Anne\u2019s bottom lip started to quiver, a clear indicator that a sob-fest was on it\u2019s way, a throaty engine roared loudly outside. Marie\u2019s eyes narrowed a bit at the sound and as she quirked an eyebrow up at the unusual sound for the quiet neighborhood, Reggie stood up to investigate. The sound grew louder before the squealing of brakes echoed right outside their front windows. He peeked through a lifted corner in the pale  linen curtains that hung in the bay window and as his eyes grew wide a small whimper escaped his lips. \n\n\u201cWhat is it, Reg?\u201d Marie jumped to her feet to join him.\n\n\u201cDid you do this?\u201d He looked at her as she gawked at the sight outside. \u201cYou know we can\u2019t afford this. You told me we can\u2019t afford this.\u201d\n\t\nMarie only shook her head in silence as she watched the 70\u2019s style black Cadillac El Dorado pull into their modest drive, towing behind it a red steel horse trailer. When it came to a stop, the trailer rocked violently as the animal inside thrashed and cried loudly. \n\t\nSlowly, the driver\u2019s door opened and out stepped a rather short and round gentleman dressed in a fine gray suit and brightly polished black leather shoes. He wore no coat despite the bitter cold temperatures outside and as he stood, surveying the home in front of him, he gently tugged off black leather driving gloves. He reached inside his suit coat and exchanged the thick black sunglasses for thick black rimmed glasses. He blinked several times and smoothed back his thinning gray hair. He practiced a smile in the tinted glass of the Cadillac, and adjusted the straightness of the bright red bow tie that adorned his neck. With a nod, he turned and walked to the family\u2019s front door. \n\t\n\u201cStay here.\u201d Reggie told Marie as he cautiously made his way to the front door. No sooner had he arrived then the doorbell chimed. The usual cheery bell tone sounded strangled and it fizzled out before finishing it\u2019s work. His hand shaking, Reggie reached for the knob and slowly opened the door. \n\t\nThe man in gray looked at Reggie for a moment before putting on his practiced smile. His teeth were bright white and very straight and they practically glowed against the dark tan of his skin.\n\t\n\u201cC-can I help you?\u201d\n\t\nThe man in gray looked down for a moment at a small envelope that was in his left hand, checked the address against the numbers next to Reggie's front door and his smile grew a little wider.\n\t\n\u201cI am looking for Anne.\u201d His voice was deep but rough, like someone that had smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for the last forty years. There was a scream from the trailer and it rocked again, almost lifting off of it\u2019s tires as it rocked left to right. Smoke curled from the slats in the steel as if something was on fire inside. \n\t\nMarie rushed to Reggie\u2019s side, grabbing at his arm for support. The man in gray looked at her the smile never fading.\n\t\n\u201cHow do you know Anne?\u201d Her voice was shaky but she stood up straight.\n\t\nThe man in gray held up the envelope. There, in Anne\u2019s handwriting, in her favorite green ink pen was a letter addressed to \"Mr. Satan\". Her name and return address in the upper left corner and small heart stickers randomly on the envelope. \n\t\nMarie\u2019s breath stuck in her throat and her heart thumped wildly. No. This was a joke. Santa\u2019s not real, Satan\u2019s not real? \n\t\n\u201cHow\u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t even get in enough air to ask the full question aloud.\n\t\n\u201cYou must have more faith in the United States Postal service, madam.\u201d The man in gray said. He gingerly opened the envelope, unfolded the pink paper and adjusted his glasses before reading...\n\nDear Mr. Satan,\n\nI have been a very good girl this year. I have asked my mommy and daddy for a pony this year for Christmas. It is all I want but they say no. Daddy told me to write a letter to you to see if you would bring me a pony. I would really like a pony.\n\nLove,\nAnne Deale, age 6\n\n\t\nHe folded the letter with care, tucked it back inside its envelope and into his suit coat pocket. The thick lenses of his glasses made his black eyes seem bulbous. He looked back and forth between the adults, waiting.\n\t\nWith a sigh he spoke, \u201cI must admit, I don\u2019t get very many letters these days but when I do, I try to respond to each one personally.\u201d \n\t\nThere was another loud crash from the trailer, followed by more smoke and shrill whinnies. By now, the neighbors were looking out their windows at the spectacle at the Deale house. A few even stood on their porches in their bathrobes, huddled against the chill to watch. Anne ran to the door squealing in excitement.\n\t\n\u201cA pony! You brought me a pony!\u201d She shoved between her parents and rushed out to the front yard. The man in gray tracked the little girl as she moved. She ran to the side of the trailer, jumping up and down trying to get a look at what was inside. \n\t\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take it.\u201d Reggie surprised himself as the words fell out of his mouth. The man in gray snapped his head back to Reggie and the smile faded.\n\t\n\u201cOf course you can.\u201d \n\t\n\u201cNo, we really don\u2019t have a place for it. I mean\u2026 thank you? We can\u2019t take care of\u2026 whatever is in there.\u201d\n\t\nThe man in gray looked down his nose at Reggie. He nodded once and snapped his fingers high in the air. Two little men jumped out of the Cadillac and rushed to the back of the trailer. Anne squealed with delight as she followed them, unafraid in the slightest at this odd spectacle. The little men chirped in a language neither Reggie nor Marie could recognize as they slowly opened the back ramp of the steel trailer. The animal inside kicked the door open the rest of the way, sending one of the little men flying into the street. Off leapt a black\u2026 what might have been a pony at one time. It\u2019s skin was in patches, some muscle and bone showing through. It\u2019s face was a horrific skull with bits of stringy hair attached. Its body steamed like it had recently been on fire. It looked around wildly, screaming so loud that it made Marie wince. Anne only ran to it, hands outstretched, giggling. \n\t\nThe pony stood still as she approached and allowed the little girl to pet and hug it. She danced with glee and beamed brightly back at her parents. \n\t\n\u201cThank you Santa!\u201d Anne cried as she wrapped her arms around the pony\u2019s neck, her arms sinking into the soft gooey flesh that remained.\n \t\n\u201cPlease my dear girl, call me Lou.\u201d The man in gray smiled back at her. \n\t\n\u201cMr. Lou,\u201d Reggie coughed. \u201cWhat are we supposed to do with this thing?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cFeed it, love it. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s yours now.\u201d He shrugged.\n\t\n\u201cDear God.\u201d Marie muttered.\n\t\nLou frowned at her.\n\t\n\u201cHe had nothing to do with it. I went out and picked this beast up myself for her. Don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d Lou growled. \n\t \nThey watched in silence as Anne ran around the front yard, the pony horror chasing and striking after her. Reggie and Marie couldn\u2019t tell if the pony was playing or truly trying to attack their little girl. Lou clapped his hands together signaling to the little men to close up the trailer.\n\t\n\u201cWell, I must be off. Do enjoy the rest of your holiday.\u201d He nodded in good bye and walked back to the Cadillac. Before opening his door, he called to Anne, beckoning her. She skipped over happily, her bare feet bright red from the cold damp ground. He pulled out a small package from his pants pocket and handed it to her. When she opened it she held up a small golden brush.\n\t\n\u201cA brush for my pony!\u201d She shrieked, so excited she shook.\n \t\nGetting her attention once more, he placed a hand on her shoulder and spoke softly. Reggie couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying but Anne nodded, her smile getting wider.  Finally, Lou patted her on the head and sent her back to her pony. He looked back at the couple in the doorway, their faces pale and in shock. He switched out his glasses for the sunglass and sunk down into the driver\u2019s seat. The engine of the Cadillac roared once more and he casually backed out. He honked the horn, waving at Anne as he slowly drove away, trailer and all. \n\t\nMarie sunk to her knees, shaking, still gripping Reggie\u2019s arm. He let out a shaky breath. What the hell were they going to do with it? Anne, clearly smitten with her pony, continued to play with it as it steamed and screamed around their small front yard. \n\t\n\u201cAnne,\u201d Reggie called softly. He didn\u2019t trust his own voice to speak louder. He could barely think as it was. \n\t\n\u201cYes, daddy?\u201d She giggled as she threw her arms up in the air. The demon pony snorted and reared on its hind legs, mimicking her.\n\t\n\u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cHe thanked me for the letter.\u201d\n\t\nReggie joined his wife on the floor just inside their front door. He wrapped her up in his arms.\n\t\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s not too horrible.\u201d He muttered, kissing his sobbing wife on the head. \n\t\n\u201cOh! And he\u2019d be back very soon to collect for my pony!\u201d Anne giggled. \n\t\n\u201cShit.\u201d Reggie muttered.\n\n_____\nEdit: This is my first ever WP and I had to fix format. Sorry!",

            "comment": "The front of the tag said \"nightwing\", I moved to turn it over but that ... thing in my front yard curled it's lip up in an ugly sneer revealing dozens, no, hundreds of long thin razor sharp teeth amongst ugly bleeding gums.\n\nI snatched my hand back, but the sneer turned into a wretch, and it began coughing. I turned to retreat to the porch, where my wife Samy was watching the strange spectacle. I tripped over a plastic reindeer. Dasher, I think.\n\n\"What's her name, daddy, what's her name!?!\", my daughter was giddy, and didn't seem to be disturbed by anything about the scene before us. Not the teeth, not the strange long muzzle, not the mix of fur and iridescent scales which both shone greasily in the Christmas morning sun.\n\n\"Ummm, ugh, nightwing I think\" I said distractedly as I attempted to disentangle myself from Dasher and his comrades. 'Nightwing' began to hork up a matted smoking hairball onto the melted snow near it's feet. It was 10 below, but I was sweating this near the burning monstrosity.\n\n\"I'm going to name her Rainbow Sparkle! No! Moon Glow! No! Sunshine Heart!\" My daughter shrieked.\n\n\"Honey, I think it's name is 'Nightwing\" I said in much the same state as before, but now further tangled in wires and blinking Christmas lights.\n\n\"Midnight! No! Snow Feather!\" she squeeled, running to her \"pony\".\n\n\"No, honey, I think it's name is...\" and suddenly I was watching with panicked horror as Gabrielle reached nightwing before I could stop her. Her little life flashed before my eyes as I imagined this nightmare parody of a horse ripping my poor daughter's neck apart with it's long drooling jaws.\n\nInstead, the beast knelt before my daughter, who grasped at the tufts of greasy fur, pulling herself onto the things back. Her tail waved excitedly and the small horn nubs at the crest of her forehead seemed to glow a dark red, lurid and difficult to look at, as if they shone with more than just earthy light.\n\nStunned, I only managed to raise my hand and utter an aborted objection, \"ugh honey, maybe we shouldn't....\"\n\nBut it was too late. The strange fur of the beast curled around my little daughter from foot to waist. Nightwing shook and wheeled around wildly. It's strange spasms became more violent, and it leap across our front lawn. The snow retreated before nightwing's mad prancing, and it left brown wet patches of grass in the snow everywhere he landed.\n\nI was left half cowering as nightwing leapt about, fearing for myself and my daughter's. But the sparse hairs sprouting from between the beast's mangy scales had formed a strangely secure saddle. She seemed to direct nightwing to wheel about and brought him proudly before her mother and me. Nightwing struck the proud parade pose of a champion, and uttering a horrid shriek and a gout of flame from it's muzzle. My darling child squealed with glee, effortlessly wheeling about and taking nightwing into the Christmas morning sky, accelerating to a near impossible speed born aloft on a rainbow made not of light, but of darkness made visible\n\nMy vision clearing, I looked down from the sky and stood up, shaking loose from the mess of wires and Christmas figures covering our yard. Samy was nuts about Christmas. She came up behind me, wrapping her long arms around my waist and chest.\n\nI surveyed our front yard. It looked like the aftermath of a brutal Yuletide civil war between plastic Christmas decorations. I noticed movement and saw the Mormon family all lined up at their front window across the street. Ten expressions, all combinations of horror, fear and disgust stared back at me. I waved and shouted \"Merry Christmas!\". The Smith's shooed their kids away from the window, quickly closing the drapes.\n\nSomewhat bewildered, I asked Samy where our little Gabrielle had gone.\n\n\"Oh, around the neighbourhood, and maybe zip into another dimension or two\" she replied. \"She'll be gone for a few hours, let's go inside and enjoy some time alone...\" she whispered, gently nibbling at my neck. I could see the life sized nativity scene in our foyer through the open door, and thought briefly about the electrical bill as Samyaza Shemhazai the Awoken, Fallen Watcher, Seer of the Name, Netherbride, Drinker of Solomon's tears and the Hellfire of my loins guided me back up the front steps and back inside.\n\n\"Our little girl's only six, and she already has her first hellsteed! A nightwing from the Great Deceiver's own stable no less!\" She said proudly.\n\nI looked down at her impish face, seeing her six erect nipples outlined under the thin silk gown. Samy was always horny on Christmas. \"'a nightwing'? So that's what, it's 'kind'?\" I asked distractedly, as my darling Sam kissed and bit at my lips.\n\n\"hmm, yes\" she whispered back.\n\n\"oh, so she will get to name it\"",

After around one hour of me hoping someone would make a crayon control legislation in the future she got up.\nShe folded up the letter with a huge sigh and walked with as much poise a six-year-old could have over to the table and set the letter underneath the cup of milk. \n\u201cwhat di-\u201c\nShe held up a hand and said \u201cdad I know I spelt some things wrong but if I show you the letter it wont come true.\u201d She replied walking away.\n\u201cBut can you please buy me a saddle?\u201d she asked looking back for a second and smiling before running up to her room.\n\n\nI really should have spell checked that letter. Like really.\nIn my defence I handled it pretty well considering I had a 2000-pound black cross between a thoroughbred and lizard in my living room. Yes I may have screamed and yes I pulled my daughter away from the beast while she was patting it which may not have been the best decision because she was the only thing keeping the creature happy.\nAs i hid behind the television sweating from my eyes my twelve year old son stomped down the stairs determined to know what woke him from his sleep. He walked down the stairs in his harry potter pyjamas and took one look.\n\u201cDad you bought a fucking thestral?\u201d he yelled.\n\nAfter a very confusing hour I seemed to clam down, I told my daughter to play with the horse and she seemed to calm it down. As I walked over to the creature, inspecting its weirdly shaped head, trying to comprehend what was happening the room temperature skyrocketed as the horse sneezed.\n\n\u201cDad it\u2019s a fire breathing threstral!\u201d My son yelled out.\n\nI tried to to think of all the savings on the gas bills while my eyebrows crumbled away.\n",

It turns out I have a horse that needs a new home.  I know it's not quite what you asked for ( we really don't keep many horses down here Pegasai and Unicorns can't stand the climate )but I think you'll enjoy it. I could not give you a purebred nightmare as they do not tolerate the atmosphere outside of hell too well. So this should be the next best thing,\u00a0 it's name of is up to you.  The horse is part nightmare and mostly mortal horse. Officially it's an Arabian stallion of impressive lineage tracing its Heritage back to horses used by Vlad the Impaler, Saladin, Genghis Khan, Ramses II, Santa Anna,  and this one Middle Eastern warlord whose name I forget right now  ( I think it started with an m he was popular some time ago) despite his fearsome heritage you couldn\u2019t  ask for a nicer horse.  He's friendly and a good conversationalist .  The flames on his main are really just red hair when the light hits it he's well-tempered and won't hurt you unless you fall off but that's what saddles are for. \n\nOtherwise he's just like a normal horse, though not immortal he should live a good 40 50 years.  \nHe likes apples and he eats grass do not feed him flaming hot Cheetos or ghost peppers or anything too spicy he gets fire breath as you will see. It will pass eventually.  While I was writing this letter he ate five pallets of cheetos..   I think Osama is better suited to be cereberus's chew toy than watching the stable... \n\nMy one daughter is going off to college and can't take care of him anymore . We hope you enjoy him\nFrom your  letter you seemed a nice enough girl (messy penmanship and poor spelling but nice enough..)so I figure he's in Better hands with you. by the way I consider it a favor that you will take good care of him so we are even on that. Enter him in all kinds and shows and races.  Especially encourage you to enter him in the Triple Crown when he comes of age( maybe he'll fix the lack of real talent in that race).    Best Wishes,\n\nLucifer Satan,\nPrince of Darkness, Father of Lies, The Roaring Lion....\u201d\n\n*******************************************************************************\nThe devil sat lounging in his office, his feet propped on a couple of sinners serving as an ottoman. A lit cigar smouldered between his fingers as his other claw gripped a tumbler of whiskey.   An imp gushed praise at his infernal master \n\u201cBoss your Brilliance knows no bounds you've made a lifelong satanist of a little girl and her family, and any children she will have and when it wins show upon show and the Triple Crown it will bring glory to your infernal name also you have further mocked the enemy's birthday.\u201d\n\nThe Devil threw back his head and laughed. \n\n\u201cNah I just wanted that damned horse out of here. I'm tired of listening to it sing the theme song to that damn cartoon my daughter was obsessed with for a while she saw that cartoon and wanted her own candy colored horse.  That song is too cheerful, even for a torture...  She would not shut up about the rainbows and the ponies and the friendship.  I'm not a goddamn horse breeder , then she went off to college and was is over it. That damned  horse is her problem now.   ",

            "comment": "Santa costumes are the worst. The beard always itches me. Can\u2019t wait for my daughter to grow up to the point she doesn\u2019t believe in Santa Claus and Unicorns anymore. Until then I guess I will have to pay my dues. Seeing Sarah\u2019s smile and the happiness in her eyes when she is woken up by Santa makes up for all of this.\n\nI wake up groggy and tired already wishing there was a double espresso shot in my hand. I have to be extra careful to not wake up Sarah by making any noises in the kitchen. If only my archaic coffee machine didn\u2019t make a sound of a lawnmower while brewing!\n\nI get out of my bed finally and jump into my slippers and go straight into the shower. One of the only benefits of being a fatass is I can easily pull off being a Santa. I have a nice beer belly going so that\u2019s always a plus. For a moment I almost feel proud of myself looking into the mirror at my naked body. I feel ashamed at myself the very next moment though. The amount of money I have spent on gym memberships would have easily covered my Hawaii trip... a dozen times. I decide to not wallow in self pity at least today. It\u2019s Christmas afterall. Jesus didn\u2019t die for this! \n\nA few minutes later I am in my Santa suit, looking legit as fuck. I wish TV shows showed a black Santa every once in a while though. Sarah is onto me. Last Christmas she had asked me, \u201cIs North Pole near the Sun?\u201d My 6 year old is outwitting her 44 year old father. Such days have come.\n\nI pick up my Santa bag, filled with all the gifts from Sarah\u2019s wish list. Well, all but one. Didn\u2019t have enough money to buy her a \u201cpony.\u201d I did create a GoFundMe campaign for this supported with a very emotional touching story about how Sarah has always wanted a pony ever since she learnt to speak. I guess it was too late as I got beat by 23 other dads posting the same campaign. None of us got a penny. I want to blame the society and not myself for not fulfilling my daughter\u2019s dreams. I\u2019m a sad petty man. Anyway, to get Sarah off my back, I told her to write a letter to Santa and he will see about that pony. And \u201cSanta\u201d can always say he got her a pony but had to use it for himself because one of his reindeers caught cold. I love how easy it is to fool children. I\u2019m certainly not in the contest for dad of the year award.\n\nAs soon as I begin walking towards Sarah\u2019s room and do my \u201cHo! Ho! Ho!\u201d santa impression, I hear someone knocking on the main door. \u201cIs Santa really here?\u201d is the first thing that comes to my mind. Who else should I be expecting at almost 4 on a cold snowy Christmas morning? I put down my bag, and climb down the stairs to check on the unexpected visitor.\n\nI peek through the peephole, and all I see is a giant horse looking straight at me. A sane person would call police or animal control at this point. But not this guy. I yell \u201cIs there anybody out there?\u201d from behind the doors and wait for a response. After 5 mins of waiting, curiosity gets the best of me and I open the door as slowly as I can. Afraid that I would startle the horse, I take baby steps maintaining my gaze. Who the fuck must have parked his horse on my lawn in the middle of night is beyond me?!\n\nI close in on the horse and see a letter of some kind tied to his collar. I unhook the letter and read out its content:\n\n&gt; *Miss Sarah Lawrence,\n&gt; \n&gt;  I hope this letter finds you in bad health. I received your letter asking me for a pony. Well we don\u2019t have ponies in hell as they are hella cute. And \u201ccute\u201d is not an adjective we want our world to be associated with. But what we do have is this horse. His name is Zeus. Please take care of him or whatever I don\u2019t care. We had an extra one lying around so I\u2019m sending Zeus to you. He can be especially useful while roasting korean bbq chicken wings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Insincerely,\n&gt; Satan*\n\nAs I finish reading through the letter, and before I even get a chance to react to what has been a very strange night so far, Zeus turns to me and the next second, my Santa beard is on fire.",

            "comment": "\"Jim, wake up...\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"It's Christmas.  You don't want to miss the kids opening their presents, do you?\"  As she said it she gave me a small kiss before slipping off to the bathroom to get ready for the morning.  I rolled over and looked at my phone.  *Six thirty, the kids won't be awake for another hour.  Maybe I'll get my present early.*\n\nShe came back wearing that black little number I bought her for our anniversary last month.  Nobody thinks much of fall weddings but the hot cider and pumpkin pies really added a touch that you rarely see at weddings.  Sarah looked at me with a coy smile and then walked back to bed, \"Merry Christmas,\" she whispered.\n\nTwenty minutes later as I dressed for the inevitable morning festivities I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.  It has been a few years since I got promoted at work but the reality of financial stability still hasn't set in.  This was the first Christmas that I swore to myself that no matter what happened, my kids would get everything they asked for this year.\n\nThey wanted the usual things, money, new cell phones, all the things they knew we wouldn't normally buy them (and a few things that they knew we would.)  But then I got to her list.  Kristen turned fifteen this past March and even though she's becoming quite the young woman she still has her moments of childhood bliss.  When I saw a pony at the end of her list my heart sank.  I knew I wanted to get her everything on the list but the practicality of owning a pony was just not feasible.\n\nI told her that if she REALLY wanted the pony Santa would have to bring it to her.  She laughed when she told me she was too old for \"that stuff\" but I told her it didn't matter what she thought she believed.  She needed to trust that things would be made right.\n\nWe sat down and she penned the letter with me and we mailed it out the next day.\n\nNow the morning was here and I knew she wouldn't be upset, but I was.  I couldn't deliver.\n\nDownstairs the kids were slowly dragging themselves to the living room where we had the tree.  It was a seven-foot Douglas Fir, lightly blue needles painted the floor around it as the rainbow lights lit up the years\u2019 worth of memory ornaments.  My favorites were always the cliched \"Baby's First\" ornaments with both Kristen and Dominic's faces embedded in them, Sarah always preferred the family ones.\n\nSarah made us all coffee as I began handing out presents.  When times were rougher we didn't really even get the opportunity to celebrate so now that things are finally turning around we cherish these moments together.\n\nDom was off playing with his new G-Phone when it happened.  It was the newest model with facial recognition and 3-D printing capability.  He was off finding small trinkets and objects for the phone to capture when we heard a noise coming from the front yard.\n\nHonestly it sounded like a low rumble at first.  It quickly progressed and turned into what sounded like footsteps.  When Dominic pulled open the curtains over the front window in the house nobody could believe what they saw.  It was Onyx black, and I don't mean that kind of black that middle aged moms dye their hair that looks purple in the sunlight, I mean to say that it was blacker than any living thing should ever be.  We just thought it was the lights in the house casting a shadow at first but then it turned around and opened its eyes.\n\nI'm not even really sure how to describe the eyes of the beast that was standing before us.  They were long, that's for sure and yet, they seemed to be on fire.  Not just glowing red, like actual fire licking up the sides of its cheeks.\n\nSuddenly it reared back as if to say, \"Look at me!\"  \n\nBefore we could decide what to do with this large fiery mammal a note seemed to pop into existence.  When I unread it I could hardly describe what I was reading.  It was notes, instructions if you will.\n\n&gt;This pet needs no food or water, EVER!\n\n&gt;This pet is only on this plane of existence because I got a happy that someone finally wrote to me.\n\n&gt;One rule, do not ride the rainbow trail.  You'll understand when the time comes.\n\nWe rushed out to see the magnificent beast first thing.  Around its neck was the letter from my daughter.  It had been delivered alright but instead of \"Santa\" she had written \"Satan.\"\n\nAs I watched Kristen fade into the distance as this \"horse\" flew toward the horizon I don't know whether or not I missed her typo or if she changed it before she sent it but however this chain of events came to pass, I know it is for the best.

            "comment": " First, a little background. My name is Chad and I'm thirty years old. I'm a respected scientist of a well known college. My area of expertise was the human brain. I was never really a religious man, I had always put my faith in science. Although I was a man firmly planted in what I perceived as reality, I was not such a terrible father as to keep my daughter from the childish belief of Santa Claus and the joy of receiving gifts on Christmas. \n\n My tale starts on the night of December 20th. \"Daddy please please please! I promise I'll get rid of some of my toys if you pwomise to get me a pony this year!\" My daughter had recently developed an obsession with horses after I brought her to a show at the county fair. I watched on as she stared at the horses prancing up and down the arena with her jaw nearly touching the floor, and her eyes filled with the utmost wonderment. I sat there for what could have been either five minutes or an eternity smiling at my precious princess. I had never seen her so happy! The thought didn't occur to me what I had just gotten myself into until I heard her murmur \"I wish I was a cowgirl...\" \n\n Now I love my daughter dearly and would do anything for her, but sadly due to some lapses in judgement at work, I was put on unpaid probation for the good part of a year. Money was tight, housing was expensive, and I had piled up a couple debts I couldn't afford to pay off right away. You could say I had a bit of a gambling problem. Well I guess you could say I had a tremendous gambling problem, which ultimately wounded up in me being a single father. I mean yes, my ex wife might have lost her beautiful wedding ring, but I was certain I could get us a yacht! \n\n It began as a frequent mentioning of how beautiful horses were and how fast they could move. \"Daddy daddy did you know horses can run as fast as a go cart? Daddy did you know that horses love apples! Hey, we have an apple tree in the backyard! Our horsey could just eat those! \n\"Wow honey that's incredible! Well I'm sure the pony would love the apples but I'm not sure there's enough room in our backyard for a horsey!\n\n These conversations went on for a couple nights and then the dreaded temper tantrums started. I want a horse! I want a horse! She would scream over and over until she couldn't scream anymore, then she would cry. That's when I had what I believed to be my brilliant idea. \"Honey if you really want a horse you should write Santa a letter! If Santa thinks your pony would enjoy living in our backyard he'll bring you one! She must have spent all night on that letter, which she would not let me read in case Santa somehow worked like birthday wishes and didn't show up if the wish wasn't a secret. \n\n Around 8:30 I walked into my pumpkins room and said lights out! She handed me the envelope that contained her masterpiece before giggling excitedly saying \"make sure you put this in the mailbox!\" I kissed her on the forehead as I tucked her into bed, \"of course I will, goodnight sweets I love you! \n\n I glanced at the envelope and had myself a laugh as I noticed the simple error on the envelope. \"To Satan!!\" With many smiley faces and hearts covering the entirety of the envelope. I decided I would leave the letter on the counter and put it away with the other memorabilia of my angel. \n\n I awoke the next day to find that the letter was not where I left it. In its place lied a pile of ash. I quickly cleaned it up and went to ask my daughter if she had mailed the letter herself, she told me she thought I did last night. In order to prevent the onslaught of tears I said oh yes honey that's right I was so tired I forgot I had. \n\n The doorbell rings and in walks the nanny. I was offering to pay her double since it was so close to the holidays. She smiled sweetly and said she would take no money at all. \"Being with this....... angel... is payment enough! She said. I knew something seemed off about her today, but I was in too much of a rush to pay much attention.\n\n I returned to an empty house and began frantically calling the nanny just trying to check on my sweets. I was answered by a raspy and tired hello Mr. Foster I'm sorry I won't be able to watch Charolette this week, I'm afraid I've come down with a nasty flu. My head started spinning as I started screaming what do you mean you were here this morning tell me where my daughter is or I'm calling the police! She told me I should go and talk to a psychologist. I was on the verge of screaming every vulgarity my worn out mind could muster when I heard the whinnying of a horse coming from the backyard. I dropped my phone and ran to the back.\n\n There stood the most magnificent creature I have ever seen. A stunning black horse with blue flames where the mane and tail should have been, attached to it was two envelopes. One being the note my daughter had written, the other was a red velvet envelope. In that very instant I realized the Devil was more than real.\n \n I open the envelope and read, Dear Mr. Foster, I do believe there was a mixup and perhaps that letter was written for someone else, but it's not everyday I get a young soul writing to me, basically asking to sign a contract. I mean I am the Devil after all! Anyways your daughter wanted a horse with fire coming out of its neck, or perhaps that was the poor wretched child's attempt at drawing a mane and tale. If I've learned anything about your family, well let's just say it's good you're a scientist and not an artist. So your daughter wanted a horse, I wanted a soul. Now I may have used a slight bit of trickery in order to obtain her soul. Good thing the young ones have a loose grip on diction am I right!? Haha well I guess you can assume what happened! I can't say I'm looking forward with corresponding with you again, Mr macho science guy, so I bid thee farewell and good luck with the rest of your life! Enjoy the pony and mind the flames! Would be a pain to have your crotch lit up by a blue flame. Those are much hotter than the red ones. \n\n Yours truly, Lucifer. Read the bottom line. I sat and cried for hours and hours until I realized something. A being as dishonest, corrupt, and evil as him, must have a bit of a gambling problem! I decided to grab a pen and paper and write my letter. It read\n\nDear Mr lucifer, you have taken something near and dear to me, and I would like to talk business with you, please come visit me as soon as possible. As I put the last letter of Mr. Foster down the letter disappeared and left behind a pile of ash. I turned around to see Lucifer. He was not at all how the fairy tales describe him as a menacing red beast with an arrow tail. He was a tall man with broad shoulder. His hair was black as night and combed neatly in a pompadour. His cheeks were gaunt, but in a handsome way. His cleft chin was perfectly proportionate and retained a stubble of a beard. Hello Mr Foster he said in a voice that was too smooth and charismatic for the devil. \n\n Well I ought to say you are vastly different than I imagined I said. He wore a beautiful silk suit perfectly fit and free of wrinkles. He definitely seemed like the business type. \n\n \"Well I wouldn't be the master of temptation if I wasn't magnificent!\" He exclaimed. He's definitely a tad bit arrogant.  \n \"Fair enough.\" I responded. \" you have taken my most beloved thing in this world. I would do anything to win her back. \n \"Why win her back when you can trade your soul for hers? Are you so willing to gamble and lose both? \nHow do you know I was going to gamble? I asked\nI know the look of a man about to throw his life away for a chance\" he responds. \"So what is your wager?\n\nIf I lose, you can take my soul with my daughter, if I win you must return my daughter to me and never bother us again.\" He thought for a moment before a smile broke out over his face. Of course we can do that! What shall we play then, poker? I turned to him and laughed.\nI already won. A look of bewilderment came across his face. I asked him to retrieve the letter I had sent him and he presented it. I retrieved a vial containing a clear liquid from my desk drawer. \nWhat the devil is that? Holy water?! He screamed. \nHaha no sir I've never been a man of god so I can't say I have any holy artifacts. I am however an established scientist who has made numerous discoveries not everyone is ready to hear yet. So I write the majority of my observations in invisible ink.\n\nI set the letter on the table and in the \"blank\" space I painted the clear liquid. The invisible ink then appeared and read \"I gamble that I will get you to agree to gambling. I win. Ps: acceptance of this gamble allows us to keep the pony, just replace the fire with hair please.\n\n Lucifer had gone completely pale. \"You sir, are the devil!\" He screamed. Well a gamble is a gamble Mr. Foster. He snaps his finger and tells me to check my daughters room. I walk in to see my angel sleeping peacefully and return to the living room.\n\n Well Mr. Foster you have got your wish. I know your past, and I look forward to having you as a team member when your time has come. Not many people can say they've tricked the devil. I bid thee farewell! With another snap of his fingers he vanished.\n\nBastard didn't change the horses fiery mane and there was  a new note on the horse. You didn't say I had to change the horse, you simply asked very politely. Although I appreciate the respectful tone, I'm gonna go ahead and take this victory PS fuck you man. ",

            "comment": "This is my first ever short story? Here goes. Sorry if it's a mess :/\n\nI woke up to the sound of sheer shrills and gleeful laughter. \n\n\"Ah, honey, it must be Christmas.\" I said, as I rolled over to cuddle with my wife a bit more.\n\n\"Mhm\" She responded, clearly not wanting to get up. She and I spent all night preparing the food and presents for our daughter and relatives.\n\nI gave her one last cuddle and sat up, preparing for the family to arrive.\n\n\"Man, why did we have to have it at our house this time? Why not at Becky's or Steve's? They're the ones with bigger houses!\" I complained, slowly getting up and feeling my knees creak.\n\n\"MOMMY! DADDY!\" Sally roared, \"A PONY! A PONY!\"\n\nMy eyes shot towards the window as I hurriedly walked towards it. I look outside and saw it.\n\nA brimstone horse grazing my front lawn, and my daughter bouncing around it. The horse clearly didn't clearly give a shit about her.\n\n\"Honey, HONEY!\" I yelled, \"YOU NEED TO GET UP HONEY!\"\n\n\"Give me five dammit!\" Miranda mumbled\n\n\"There's a fucking HORSE outside!\" I exasperated \n\nHer eyes shot open. \"What?\" She got up to look at me. Bafflement was etched into her face.\n\nI started making my way downstairs at mach 5, \"Get some clothes on! I'm going to get Sally!\" I yelled\n\nAs I made my way downstairs, all I could hear was Sallies glee. Well, at least she got that. \n\nI slammed open the door to bear witness the full glory of this horse. \n\nIt's color was brimstone and these clear horns grew out the side of it's head, his mane was a deep crimson flame all the way down to it's tail. \n\nThe grass around it was turning crispy, it's hooves leaving molten grass and dirt in it's wake. \n\nAs I started my approach my foot slammed into an object.\n\n\"Ow, what the fuck? Who left this bric...\" I trailed off and my gaze wandering downward.\n\nNear my foot was this nice crimson leather box, with a white parchment on the front with words blazing on it.\n\nI reached down and lifted the box back up to me and looked at the physical impossibility.\n\nThe words were OPEN ME.\n\n\"Daddy, daddy! Can we keep him? CAN WE KEEP HIM!?!\" She gleefully roared.\n\n\"Uh..Hold on dear.\" I mumbled.\n\nI opened the box and fiery puff of smoke came out, I reeled back so that it doesn't go in my face.\n\nLooking down in the box I saw a black leather bridle and a brush. Under it all a note was at the bottom. \n\n\"Hey, Daddy, whose that?\" Sally questioned.\n\n\"What?\" I replied looking up.\n\nStanding before me was a man wearing a rich crimson striped suit, the stripes flickering like little candle flames. His skin was a deep brown and his eyes burned red. His hair was a nicely kept ponytail. On his face was a mustache and goatee. \n\n\"Hello, Sally!\" His voice hummed, \"Do you like my present?\" \n\n\"YES! Are you Sandy Claws?\" she gleefully asked, her eyes wide with astonishment.\n\n\"Why...yes I am!\" He carefully answered, \"I had to come here this time for a present I forgot about.\"\n\n\"Present!?\" Sally squealed! \"You got me another present?!\"\n\n\"Yes, I did! You got to have something to sit on while riding Princess don't you?\" he explained and stepped back.\n\nOn the ground near his feat was a saddle dyed black, just like the bridle in the box.\n\nHe picked up the saddle and fit it on the beast, \"Splendid!\" he said as he finished doing the fastens.\n\nHe picked up my child and put her on Princess, \"Now, Sally, your dad and I have somethings we must discuss, can you take Princess to the back yard?\" He asked. As if on queue the horse started making it's way to the back yard.\n\n\"Well then.\" he finished.\n\n\"Wha...what is that?\" I dumbfoundingly asked.\n\n\"What? Never seen a horse before? He snarkily replied.\n\n\"Never like that!\" I snapped back. \"What did you give to my daughter?\" \n\n\"A horse you moron.\" He said while face palming \"It's not going to hurt her.\"\n\n\"How in the fuck am I supposed to know that?!\" I yelled.\n\n\"Who do you think I am?\" He replied angerily.\n\n\"You're....Sant-?\" I tried saying.\n\n\"Don't.\" He snapped, \"You know exactly who I am.\"\n\nSigh, \"Satan.\" I defeatedly admitted.\n\n\"Satan.\" He flatly answered.\n\n\"Now, on the topic of dear Sally, I must say she is one of the sweetest girls I have ever met! Normally I don't get those types of letters. Really once a thousand years, so I came personally to thank her.\" He said.\n\n\"You know damn well she meant Santa.\" I replied.\n\n\"Hey, a letter is a letter, especially one addressed to me.\" He said, finishing with a smile. His teeth razor sharp points.\n\n\"Now, really, whose fault is it that a letter got sent to ME?\" he smartassedly asked.\n\n\"Sigh...mine.\" I answered.\n\n\"Haha, there it is!\" He laughed, underneath it you can hear a faint hiss.\n\n\"Now, I tell you what, normally I make a \"deal\". You know, the whole shebang.\" He explained, \"BUT, since it's the spirit of ol' saint nick, that old bastard, I've decided maybe, just maybe, I'll be a bit benevolent...\"\n\n\"So, there won't be a deal?\" I asked\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh thank god.\" I stupidly said.\n\nSatan's face scrunched up and his eyes burned red. His face looked like utter disgust.\n\n\"Really man, gotta bring him here?\" he angrily said. \n\n\"Right, sorry.\" I replied\n\n\"Damn, maybe you want a deal.\" he said.\n\n\"No, no last time that....\" I absentmindedly said.\n\n\"Hey, hey, where are we?\" He interjected.\n\nI realized my mistake. But you just can't not answer Satan himself.\n\n\"We're....We're in Georgia..\" I quietly answered.\n\n\"What was that?\" He excitedly asked?\n\n\"Georgia.\" I answered. Man, why the hell am I an idiot?\n\n\"Hoo boy.\" He laughed menacingly, \"You wouldn't happen to know how to play a damn mean fiddle would you?\"\n\n\"Fuck.\" I answered. ",

No that can't be right  \nit surely must be an illusion of my mind.\"  \nHe stepped on a box then picked it up  \ntwo letters inside, he opened each one up.\n\nThe first one read :  \n'He has mastered bending fire and can teach you too  \nbut, Take care of him, he's a bit shy.  \nFrom Satan'\n\nAnd the second :  \n'Dearest Satan,  \nI love you!!! I am 5 year old now  \nand have been very good.  \nCan you please please send me a pony?  \nI will love her and share my food.  \nPlease!!!  \nThank Yu  \nAzula'",
